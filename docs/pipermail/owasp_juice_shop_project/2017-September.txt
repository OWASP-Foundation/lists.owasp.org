Subject: [OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project] Juice Shop Release v5.0.0
Message-ID: <000401d32799$81bb4650$8531d2f0$@owasp.org>

Dear Juice Shoppers,

 

your favorite and trusted eCommerce store has received yet another major
update: Yesterday v5.0.0 was released, adding NoSQL Injection and
Typosquatting vulnerabilities. For the full release notes, please see
https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/tag/v5.0.0.

 

The accompanying eBook was also updated and will offer hints and full
solutions for all the new hacking challenges. The new chapter "Codebase 101"
has been started, but at the moment it is mostly TODO markers. It's future
purpose will be to give an overview of how the source code of OWAS Juice
Shop is organized. The target audience is of course potential contributors,
who would like to be shown around a bit before starting to code.

 

Please remember that the latest version of this book is always available on
https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content whereas
Leanpub will always offer the current official release version.

 

I hope you enjoy the new challenges! Cheers,

Bj?rn
