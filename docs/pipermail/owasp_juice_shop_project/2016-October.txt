Hello juice shoppers,

the next release (v2.16) of Juice Shop will switch to node.js v6 as the default. This is time wise coupled with v6 going officially into LTS state. Juice Shop will still work and be CI tested with v4. We dropped official v5 support and testing, because that version is abandoned by node.js development team.

TL;DR: For users, things should work as they did before! Resume your challenge hunt! ?

Cheers,
Bj?rn

Subject: [OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project] Upcoming: Release v2.17.x / OWASP
	Gothenburg Day / German OWASP Day
Message-ID: <trinity-40403f4d-ea57-4eca-ad31-e4b6bbd66c00-1477641569946@3capp-gmx-bs34>

Dear Juice Shoppers,

a few notes on what's coming next from your favorite rock-solid-and-secure webapp:

New features in upcoming release v2.17.x
========================================

* The difficulty ratings for the - by then 37 - hacking challenges has been changed from 1-3 to a 1-5 stars scale. At the same time several challenges were completely reassessed based on user feedback.
* You can now log in to the Juice Shop with your Google account using OAuth 2.0. This is a serious convenience improvement over manual user registration. Of course, there might be one or two minor issues in how we implemented the client side of the OAuth 2.0 authentication. In case you do not see the new "Log in with Google" button, you run the application on some unrecognized hostname. This does not prevent you from solving the OAuth-related challenges, though.
* I added Docker images and ZIP/TGZ-distribution archives for the recently released Node.js 7.x.

The release of 2.17.x will probably happend somewhere next week after the 5th and final episode of "Pentesting the OWASP Juice Shop" on the "7 Minute Security Podcast" (https://7ms.us/) is out. It would probably be confusing for the viewers to have the difficulty ratings suddenly change in an ongoing video-series... ;-)

If you want to play around with the pre-release version, you can do so with the Docker image "bkimminich/juice-shop:snapshot".

Upcoming talks and workshops
============================

* I will be holding a 3h hacking workshop "Gothenburg pwns the OWASP Juice Shop" (https://owaspgbgday.se/bjorn-kimminich-gothenburg-pwns-the-owasp-juice-shop-workshop/) at OWASP Gothenburg Day 2016 (https://owaspgbgday.se) on 24th November in Sweden...
* ...and a 10min Lightning-Talk "What's new in OWASP Juice Shop" at German OWASP Day 2016 (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/German_OWASP_Day_2016/) in Darmstadt, Germany

If someone feels like translating (https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop) the application into Swedish before the OWASP Gothenburg Day, I?ll bring a Juice Shop t-shirt for her/him to the event and hand it over live on stage!

(For everyone else, there will be free laptop stickers and also pin-back buttons at both events!)

Cheers,
Bjoern
