Subject: [OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project] Apply your own corporate look & feel
	onto OWASP Juice Shop v2.25.0!
Message-ID: <001e01d2aac7$a2d7ef40$e887cdc0$@owasp.org>

Dear all, 
? 
I just released v2.25 which adds an awesome new feature to the OWASP Juice
Shop: Via a simple YAML-based configuration file you can now customize the
look & feel (logo, app name, theme, ...) and all products the store! Why
would you want to do this? When using Juice Shop in trainings for your
employer or at a customer, you might actually increase the awareness impact
by customizing the Juice Shop to their very own corporate identity and
business domain! Kudos to Timo Pagel for envisioning and contributing this
feature!
? 
The following customization examples are delivered out of the box with OWASP
Juice Shop v2.25.0: 
* The BodgeIt Store: An homage to our server-side rendered ancestor 
* Sick-Shop: A store that offers a variety of illnesses. Achoo! Bless you! 
? 
Please check out
https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/CUSTOMIZATION.md to
learn how to use one of these samples and how to roll your own corporate
theme! You can even use the existing end-to-end test suite to verify if all
hacking challenges will keep working with yourcustom configuration! Below
you also find the complete release notes. Some challenge solutions needed to
be adjusted to work with the new customization feature. The "Pwning OWASP
Juice Shop" companion guide eBook available at
https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content will be
updated soon after to reflect those changes.
? 
Cheers, 
Bjoern

PS in case you are wondering: No, this is not an April's Fools joke!

Subject: [OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project] OWASP Juice Shop News: Release v2.26 /
	Participation in upcoming summits
Message-ID: <CAKZd3EwtVOjb7xBKFdgNWv0tvTADBB5XeJxus5PQOEgT5w=BVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

the OWASP Juice Shop just published its 83rd release: v2.26.0! This is
the second release in a row where the most significant
features/improvements were provided by external contributors and not
by yours-truly. I deeply hope that this trend continues... ;-)

You can find the full release notes down below, so here is just the
TL;DR highlights of v2.26:

1.) Using Juice Shop in CTF events is now more convenient than ever,
while in a non-CTF setup you won't see those strange flag codes any
more
2.) The Docker image size was reduced from 900 to 300MB by switching
to an Alpine Linux base-image
3.) Adding Burmese to the list, Juice Shop's UI is now fully
translated into 17 languages

If you think about participating in the project, you are lucky: I will
be at the Project Summit right before AppSecEU in Belfast and at the
OWASP Summit in London
(http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop.html) hoping to
onboard new contributors and collect good (or even
some crazy) ideas how to make the Juice Shop even better (and
crazier)! If you cannot make it to either event, just shoot me an
email or
Twitter-DM to get in touch! Or just pick an issue from GitHub (for
example one labled "newbie friendly") and start coding!

Cheers,
Bjoern Kimminich
(Project Leader OWASP Juice Shop)

Subject: [OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project] OWASP Juice Shop Release v3.0.1
Message-ID: <000201d2c071$4cf50850$e6df18f0$@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,

 

I fixed and improved some aspects of the Juice Shop?s YAML-based customization feature. These changes might break some existing config files, which is why I did a major version bump to v3.0.1!

 

Migration effort is minimal: You might have to rename a few properties in your YAML-config, and that?s it! Please find the full release notes below.

 

Cheers,

Bj?rn Kimminich (Project Lead OWASP Juice Shop)



 

 


 <https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/tag/v3.0.1> v3.0.1


Fixes


*	Fixed unusable packaged distributions due to missing index.template.html

 


 <https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/tag/v3.0.0> v3.0.0


Incompatible changes


*	? simplified and extended configuration mechanism (see  <https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/v3.0.0/CUSTOMIZATION.md> CUSTOMIZATION.md)

*	properties application.logo, application.favicon and all products.image now handle files and URLs
*	added property showGitHubRibbon (defaults to true)
*	removed obsolete properties for logo, favicon and product image URLs

??Custom YAML configuration files from v2.x might not work with v3.0.0! Refer to  <https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/v3.0.0/CUSTOMIZATION.md> CUSTOMIZATION.md to migrate to latest configuration specs. For a yourconfig.yml run NODE_ENV=yourconfig npm run protractor to verify all challenges will work in customized mode.


Compatible changes

*	apps/index.html is now generated from apps/index.template.html
*	apps/index.html is now in .gitignore to avoid accidental commits


Fixes


*	fixed potential server crash from SQLI on login form ( <https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/301> #301)
*	fixed missing Twitter and Facebook link customization on basket page


Miscellaneous
