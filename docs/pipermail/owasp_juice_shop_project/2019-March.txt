Subject: [OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project] Move to Google Groups
Message-ID: <CAKZd3EwkjQC=VtidsALoWrEvU47qMrcXtK_mZJh5C+OSp9fxtw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear subscribers,

We are performing a general move from Mailman to Google Groups, and if
you'd like to follow along, please join here:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/juice-shop-project/join

As you probably noticed, the Juice Shop mailing lists was never a really
active one. That's probably due to the fact that active discussions mostly
happen on Slack, Gitter, Twitter and other more direct channels. Issue
reports go typically into GitHub directly. But: For distributing
information like release notes or upcoming events, I should actually try
not to forget the mailing list as often as I did the past... :-)

Cheers,
Bj?rn

PS: I will (try to remember to) double-post on this list and on Google
Groups until the migration is complete.
