Dear Juice Shoppers,

with today's release v2.24.0 we added three more full translations of
the Juice Shop user interface: Norwegian, Japanese and French. Juice
Shop is now fully available in 15 different languages!

If you want to help with even more translations, please join us on CrowdIn:

Enjoy hacking,
