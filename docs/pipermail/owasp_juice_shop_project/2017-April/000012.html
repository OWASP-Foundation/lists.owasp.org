<PRE>Hi everyone,

the OWASP Juice Shop just published its 83rd release: v2.26.0! This is
the second release in a row where the most significant
features/improvements were provided by external contributors and not
by yours-truly. I deeply hope that this trend continues... ;-)

You can find the full release notes down below, so here is just the
TL;DR highlights of v2.26:

1.) Using Juice Shop in CTF events is now more convenient than ever,
while in a non-CTF setup you won't see those strange flag codes any
more
2.) The Docker image size was reduced from 900 to 300MB by switching
to an Alpine Linux base-image
3.) Adding Burmese to the list, Juice Shop's UI is now fully
translated into 17 languages

If you think about participating in the project, you are lucky: I will
be at the Project Summit right before AppSecEU in Belfast and at the
OWASP Summit in London
(<A HREF="http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop.html">http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Juice-Shop.html</A>) hoping to
onboard new contributors and collect good (or even
some crazy) ideas how to make the Juice Shop even better (and
crazier)! If you cannot make it to either event, just shoot me an
email or
Twitter-DM to get in touch! Or just pick an issue from GitHub (for
example one labled &quot;newbie friendly&quot;) and start coding!

Cheers,
Bjoern Kimminich
(Project Leader OWASP Juice Shop)
