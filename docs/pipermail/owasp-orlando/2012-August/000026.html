<PRE>Good afternoon OWASP Orlando,

We have posted details of our September 12th meeting at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando.</A> I also wanted to announce that
Symantec has once again become an organizational supporter for the OWASP
parent organization and this time has allocated a portion of the funds
($1000) to our local chapter. Thanks so much Symantec!  I also wanted to
thank the UCF College of Medicine for their support so far. Without their
assistance none of this would be possible. Due to support issues with
Regonline we are back to using Eventbrite for events and will be using
Cvent for any donation related transactions. For those of you interested in
the various membership options, you can check out
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A> for more info.

We have also received some feedback regarding our meeting location and many
have complained it was too far to drive. For Q3 this will remain unchanged
and we greatly appreciate the assistance Kevin Smith and UCF has provided
in hosting our meeting. However, we would be remiss if we did not try
to accommodate everyone so I'm asking for your assistance in identifying
alternate locations, preferably university settings since they are neutral
ground and mesh well with our strategic goals of academic alliance. If you
have ideas please send Bill or I an email and we will try to work on a more
central location for future meetings. We do listen to the feedback we
receive and welcome your comments, be they good or bad.

Now on to the details of our next meeting.


   - Meeting Date: September 12, 2012 6:00 - 8:00 PM (or until we decide to
   go home)
   - Meeting Location: UCF College of Medicine

*Q3 2012 Meeting September 12*

*5:45 - 6:00 Arrive*

*6:00 - 6:15 Welcome and Opening Remarks / Appsec Trivia*

*6:15 - 7:00 &quot;An Insider's Look: WAF and Identity and Access Management
Integration&quot;* - Jan Poczobutt, Director of Enterprise ADC &amp; WAF Sales at
Barracuda Networks, will provide an inside look at some of the problems
with traditional access management implementations and how enterprises can
sucessfully overcome these challenges by integrating web application
firewall technologies with Identity and Access Management. Learn about best
practices, specific use cases and how this new integration translates into
operational simplicity for the enterprise.

*7:00 - 7:15 Break*

*7:15 - 8:00+ &quot;Don't Drop the SOAP: Real World Web Service Testing for Web
Hackers&quot;* - Over the years web services have become an integral part of web
and mobile applications. From critical business applications like SAP to
mobile applications used by millions, web services are becoming more of an
attack vector than ever before. Unfortunately, penetration testers haven't
kept up with the popularity of web services, recent advancements in web
service technology, testing methodologies and tools. In fact, most of the
methodologies and tools currently available either don't work properly, are
poorly designed or don't fully test for real world web service
vulnerabilities. In addition, environments for testing web service tools
and attack techniques have been limited to home grown solutions or worse
yet, production environments.


In this presentation Kevin Johnson will discuss the new security issues
with web services and discuss an updated web service testing methodology
released at Defcon 19 last year that will be integrated into the OWASP
testing guide, new Metasploit modules and exploits for attacking web
services and an open source vulnerable web service for the Samurai-WTF (Web
Testing Framework) that can be used by penetration testers to test web
service attack tools and techniques.



   - Kevin Johnson is a security consultant and founder of Secure Ideas.
   Kevin came to security from a development and system administration
   background. He has many years of experience performing security services
   for fortune 100 companies, and in his spare time he contributes to a large
   number of open source security projects. Kevin's involvement in open-source
   projects is spread across a number of projects and efforts. He is the
   founder of many different projects and has worked on others. He founded
   BASE, which is a Web front-end for Snort analysis. He also founded and
   continues to lead the SamuraiWTF live DVD. This is a live environment
   focused on Web penetration testing. He also founded Yokoso and Laudanum,
   which are focused on exploit delivery. Kevin is a certified instructor for
   SANS and the author of Security 542: Web Application Penetration Testing
   and Ethical Hacking. He also presents at industry events, including DEFCON
   and ShmooCon, and for various organizations, like Infragard, ISACA, ISSA,
   and the University of Florida.
