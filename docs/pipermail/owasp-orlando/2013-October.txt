We'd like to welcome Jon Singer as our newest co-leader for OWASP Orlando.
Some of you may remember the impromptu hacking workshop he conducted in
lieu of my absence for the Q2 meeting. Jon comes to us as the founder and
captain of the UCF Collegiate Cyber Defense Club http://hackucf.org and
CCDC/CTF team where they have consistently earned top placements for
multiple competitions. Jon is also a co-founder and board member for
Security B-Sides Orlando http://bsidesorlando.org and works as a Security
Analyst for GuidePoint Security http://www.guidepointsecurity.com . While
Jon is due to graduate in the next few months, he maintains close contact
with various university computer science programs and security clubs and we
are looking forward to expanding our academic outreach opportunities.
Welcome Jon!

To celebrate and to thank all of you for being a part of OWASP Orlando,
whether you be sponsors, attendees or just interested in what we are about,
we are holding a social event on October 30th at Buffalo Wild Wings. Free
wings and beer and good conversation! For more info and registration,
please visit https://owasp-orlando-2013.eventbrite.com/

Registration is required and will be limited to the first 30 registrants.
If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please reach out to me or Jon.

Thanks, and looking forward to seeing you in 2 weeks!
