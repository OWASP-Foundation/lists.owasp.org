	Orlando - December 5-9
Message-ID: <015101cc81e1$f47736e0$dd65a4a0$@zakongroup.com>

The longest running infosec conference in the world will be held this
December in Orlando.  Registration is now open for the 27th Annual Computer
Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) at www.acsac.org.  

 

Of special interest to OWASP members will be the technical sessions on web
and mobile security, and the training courses on Java security and the OWASP
Top 10 & Beyond.

 

If you'd like to present a cool project you're working on, submissions for
the Works-in-Progress session are still being accepted.

 

Get a free registration by having your company sign up as a Silver or Gold

Subject: [Owasp-orlando] OWASP Orlando Inaugural Meeting
Message-ID: <CAFm0_mxrizFS2ZmsDd99mufV6E9LNzmyAKtWqiGSU4KnGeeE_Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm sending this out to all of the Florida OWASP lists I'm aware of so for
those of you already on the Orlando list I apologize for the spam. If you
know anyone that might be interested please feel free to forward this to
them.

We will be holding our first meeting on October 19 for an informal gathering
of those interested in the OWASP mission. This is a chance to get to know
the other members of the chapter and engage in the initial dialogue that
will drive the direction of the group. We want to know what kinds of
technologies you use or are interested in learning about, the challenges you
are facing in your daily work and get a sense for the types of content you
want to see at future meetings. I will bring some copies of various OWASP
guides and possibly some other OWASP shwag to this initial meeting. We will
be covering the OWASP mission, culture, and a high level view of some of the
OWASP projects. The format for this meeting will largely be discussion
oriented. Future meetings will be more content-driven in a more structured
environment.

This is not currently a sponsored event, but we do have interested parties
asking about sponsorship opportunities so this may change for future events.
Again, you will be responsible for your own food and drink purchases. If you
plan on attending, please RSVP as I have only made reservations for 10 and
will need to modify them if we expect more than that. We look forward to
seeing you there!

   - Meeting Date: October 19, 2011 6:30 PM til whenever
   - Meeting Location: Seasons 52 in Orlando, FL at 7700 W Sand Lake Rd.

	Beyond
Message-ID: <029f01cc89f2$ef4d8e30$cde8aa90$@zakongroup.com>

The following course is being taught at the ACSAC 2011 conference in Lake
Buena Vista on December 5th:
 
  Course M1 - Keeping Your Web Apps Secure: The OWASP Top 10 & Beyond
  https://www.acsac.org/2011/program/courses/webappsec/

The course is a half-day version of the sold out WebAppSec course taught
last month at the AppSecUSA conference
(www.appsecusa.org/training.html#oneday).  Course content includes both the
Top 10 and additional vulnerabilities/risks.
	
All attendees will receive a free copy of the book "The Web Application
Hacker's Handbook" and printed course notes, along with a certificate of
completion which may be used for documenting CPE credits.

Note that you can sign up for the course alone if you are unable to attend
the conference.

I will be in attendance at the event below but we do not have a booth or any
official OWASP affiliation with this conference. There is an application
security session listed on the agenda but I do not have any specifics on the
topic or speaker details. Feel free to come out and say hi. I will be
meeting with 2 prospective sponsors here and am hoping to find more
information regarding permanent meeting venues for our Q1 2012 meeting (and
beyond). I'd love to meet more of you that may not have been able to make
our first meeting last week.

Hi Michael,

It was yesterday and was largely a security awareness event for UCF. I'd say
was roughly 80 folks or so, mostly UCF staff. Content was very high level.
Not much of interest for technical folks but glad to see they are educating
their people and opening it up to the public. I had a meeting with a local
consulting firm that same day who is willing to commit $300.00 to the
chapter and more once we grow our membership a bit. I also made a contact
with UCF I am hoping will be able to provide us a permanent space for
meetings. I think university partnership is an excellent way to grow the
OWASP community and I have high hopes that we can grow something positive
here.

-Tony
