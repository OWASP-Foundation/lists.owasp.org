Subject: [Owasp-orlando] OWASP Orlando Q3 2012 Meeting September 12
Message-ID: <CAFm0_mzrQs=qyp4TofYH4FJ9WooaE9wM0daqqdygTeTQkhutPA@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon OWASP Orlando,

We have posted details of our September 12th meeting at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando. I also wanted to announce that
Symantec has once again become an organizational supporter for the OWASP
parent organization and this time has allocated a portion of the funds
($1000) to our local chapter. Thanks so much Symantec!  I also wanted to
thank the UCF College of Medicine for their support so far. Without their
assistance none of this would be possible. Due to support issues with
Regonline we are back to using Eventbrite for events and will be using
Cvent for any donation related transactions. For those of you interested in
the various membership options, you can check out
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership for more info.

We have also received some feedback regarding our meeting location and many
have complained it was too far to drive. For Q3 this will remain unchanged
and we greatly appreciate the assistance Kevin Smith and UCF has provided
in hosting our meeting. However, we would be remiss if we did not try
to accommodate everyone so I'm asking for your assistance in identifying
alternate locations, preferably university settings since they are neutral
ground and mesh well with our strategic goals of academic alliance. If you
have ideas please send Bill or I an email and we will try to work on a more
central location for future meetings. We do listen to the feedback we
receive and welcome your comments, be they good or bad.

Now on to the details of our next meeting.


   - Meeting Date: September 12, 2012 6:00 - 8:00 PM (or until we decide to
   go home)
   - Meeting Location: UCF College of Medicine
   - Google maps link: http://goo.gl/ztZTF


Registration link at http://owasp-orlando.eventbrite.com/


*Q3 2012 Meeting September 12*

*5:45 - 6:00 Arrive*

*6:00 - 6:15 Welcome and Opening Remarks / Appsec Trivia*

*6:15 - 7:00 "An Insider's Look: WAF and Identity and Access Management
Integration"* - Jan Poczobutt, Director of Enterprise ADC & WAF Sales at
Barracuda Networks, will provide an inside look at some of the problems
with traditional access management implementations and how enterprises can
sucessfully overcome these challenges by integrating web application
firewall technologies with Identity and Access Management. Learn about best
practices, specific use cases and how this new integration translates into
operational simplicity for the enterprise.

*7:00 - 7:15 Break*

*7:15 - 8:00+ "Don't Drop the SOAP: Real World Web Service Testing for Web
Hackers"* - Over the years web services have become an integral part of web
and mobile applications. From critical business applications like SAP to
mobile applications used by millions, web services are becoming more of an
attack vector than ever before. Unfortunately, penetration testers haven't
kept up with the popularity of web services, recent advancements in web
service technology, testing methodologies and tools. In fact, most of the
methodologies and tools currently available either don't work properly, are
poorly designed or don't fully test for real world web service
vulnerabilities. In addition, environments for testing web service tools
and attack techniques have been limited to home grown solutions or worse
yet, production environments.


In this presentation Kevin Johnson will discuss the new security issues
with web services and discuss an updated web service testing methodology
released at Defcon 19 last year that will be integrated into the OWASP
testing guide, new Metasploit modules and exploits for attacking web
services and an open source vulnerable web service for the Samurai-WTF (Web
Testing Framework) that can be used by penetration testers to test web
service attack tools and techniques.



   - Kevin Johnson is a security consultant and founder of Secure Ideas.
   Kevin came to security from a development and system administration
   background. He has many years of experience performing security services
   for fortune 100 companies, and in his spare time he contributes to a large
   number of open source security projects. Kevin's involvement in open-source
   projects is spread across a number of projects and efforts. He is the
   founder of many different projects and has worked on others. He founded
   BASE, which is a Web front-end for Snort analysis. He also founded and
   continues to lead the SamuraiWTF live DVD. This is a live environment
   focused on Web penetration testing. He also founded Yokoso and Laudanum,
   which are focused on exploit delivery. Kevin is a certified instructor for
   SANS and the author of Security 542: Web Application Penetration Testing
   and Ethical Hacking. He also presents at industry events, including DEFCON
   and ShmooCon, and for various organizations, like Infragard, ISACA, ISSA,
   and the University of Florida.

===============================================================

3. Call for Posters & Works-in-Progress  

There is still time to submit a Poster or Work-in-Progress to ACSAC 2012.
Submissions are due September 3, 2012.
 
The Works in Progress (WiP) session packs as many 5-minute presentations as
possible into one fast paced and popular session. These presentations
highlight some of the most current work in computer security and are an
excellent opportunity to get feedback on your project or idea from the
community or find interested collaborators.
 
https://www.acsac.org/2012/cfp/wip/
 
The Poster session offers you a chance to present your work to the security
community in an informal, interactive manner. Posters can present completed
projects or might represent interesting results from preliminary or
exploratory work. Poster presenters will have an opportunity to discuss
their research in depth with other interested attendees.
 
https://www.acsac.org/2012/cfp/posters/

===============================================================

4. LAW Workshop CFP    
 
The Layered Assurance Workshop (LAW) concerns itself with the fundamental
problems of compositional assurance and the need for principles, methods,
and techniques that can be applied to achieve the assurance necessary for
security-critical, safety-critical, and mission-critical components and
systems.  LAW has provided a forum for vital exchange, as well as a maturing
source of information, focused on key issues related to the effective and
efficient modular construction and certification of assured systems from
assured components. It is widely recognized that such an approach is the
most promising way to achieve diverse and flexible systems that can be
certified quickly and cost effectively.  Now in its 6th year, LAW has
matured to become a recognized venue for practitioners and researchers
interested in the development and certification of assured systems. More
information can be found at:
 
https://www.acsac.org/2012/workshops/law/

===============================================================

5. CCW Workshop CFP
 
This year's Issues Workshop will focus on cloud computing security, how
users of cloud systems can be educated to maintain the security posture of
their systems, and how to improve the state of the art of cloud computing.
The workshop will also look at the need to facilitate research and
development of the next generation of cloud computing security standards and
tools to assist in the creation of better, more secure systems.  Cloud
computing presents a number of security concerns due to the nature of the
cloud, including the following: data protection, identity management,
authentication and authorization standards, policy management, and
virtualization process implementation. Infrastructures for the cloud may be
built on servers using different types of technologies, including different
methods of virtualization that have risks associated with their use.
Participants are encouraged but not required to submit position papers due
October 1, 2012. More information can be found at:

https://www.acsac.org/2012/workshops/ccw/

===============================================================

6. Sponsorships     

Attend the ACSAC technical program for free!  Have your organization sponsor
ACSAC at the Silver or Gold level, and you will get a free conference pass.
As a nonprofit with an all-volunteer staff, ACSAC seeks sponsorships in
order to support a conference that stresses the interaction between our
academic, governmental and industry participants.  By sponsoring ACSAC, we
are pleased to make available benefits to your organization that include
complementary registration, collateral material distribution to attendees,
and recognition in marketing materials such as the ACSAC web site, on-site
signage, and mobile, online and printed programs. For additional information
on becoming an ACSAC sponsor, visit:

https://www.acsac.org/2012/sponsors/

===============================================================

7. Student Conferenceships

ACSAC offers conferenceships for students who otherwise would not be able to
attend the conference. Conferenceship awards will normally take the form of
partial to full reimbursement (after the student attends the conference) to
be applied against conference registration and travel/lodging expenses.
 
For interested students, conferenceships are also available to cover
registration costs for Tracer FIRE.  Again, students receiving these awards
will receive reimbursement after registering for Tracer FIRE and attending
this two-day, highly stimulating and educational forensics and incident
response exercise.  Tracer FIRE will be held immediately prior to the main
conference program on December 3 and 4.
 
Applicants applying by September 3, 2012 will receive priority review and
approval. More information can be found at:
