Team,

Our awesome co-coordinator, Tony Turner, planned to speak this evening and
run the workshop. He had an emergency come up and will not be able to make
it. The meeting will be very freeform and there will not be a set
presentation. Our apologies for the short notice. If anyone does decide to
come out, we can discuss security topics and socialize.

Thank you,
Bill Riggins
OWASP Orlando
