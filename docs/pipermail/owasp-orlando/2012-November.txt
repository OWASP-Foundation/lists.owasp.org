For those of you that missed AppSec USA in Austin last month, you can view
videos of the presentations at http://videos.2012.appsecusa.org.I highly
recommend checking them out as there were some phenomenal presentations
delivered.

I also wanted to take a moment to apologize for the lack of a Q4 meeting
due to a perfect storm of issues that arose. We had one speaker lined up
that cancelled and another I evaluated to be too vendor focused to meet our
stringent quality guidelines for content, we are in the process of
switching venues to the main UCF campus and I've admittedly become bogged
down in leading planning efforts for Security B-Sides Orlando being held
April 13-14 at the Wyndham Orlando Resort next year. (see
http://bsidesorlando.org for more info)

That being said, we hope to have a bit more active quarter in Q1 of next
year and I should have more info on what I mean by that in the next few
weeks. Thanks for your understanding and have a great weekend.
