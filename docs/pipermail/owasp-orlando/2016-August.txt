Dear All,

Unfortunately, our July 28th presentation couldn?t be delivered due to unforeseen circumstances. The presentation has been postponed to Thursday August 25 at 5pm (the day after tomorrow). This is a great chance to socialize, meet fellow security enthusiasts and professionals, and learn how threat actors can bypass IDS using Scapy.

Meeting details can be found on our Meetup group: http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Orlando/events/233427954/

As usual, free food and drinks will be provided. :-) We look forward to seeing you there!

Best,
ap
