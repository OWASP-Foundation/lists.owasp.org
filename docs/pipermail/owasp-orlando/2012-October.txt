Subject: [Owasp-orlando] Web Application Security Training @ Lake Buena
	Vista - December 1st
Message-ID: <020501cdb773$9aced260$d06c7720$@zakongroup.com>

The early (discounted) registration deadline for the secure web application
development course is approaching in a couple of weeks.  The course is being
taught on December 1st at the ACSAC security conference in the Buena Vista
Palace Hotel.  You may register for just the course and do not need to
register for the full conference (although there is a great program with
keynotes from Google and IARPA, along with 100 other speakers and trainers).
	
Course information is available at:
  https://www.acsac.org/2012/program/courses/webappsec/
The course was sold out last year, so early registration is encouraged.

Registration information may be found at:
