Message-ID: <CAFm0_mxVyPRx_+yjgRkaFQhfPgkVZT2huCsFos=pEann1Bj3kA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

Just a reminder about B-Sides Orlando coming up:

We are about 10 days out from our 3rd annual 2015 B-Sides Orlando event
http://bsidesorlando.org/2015
<https://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbsidesorlando%2Eorg%2F2015&urlhash=OHKT&_t=tracking_anet>
and
tickets are going fast. We are bringing back the popular K&&K CTF with some
really awesome prizes this year, the TOOOL lockpick village, some awesome
workshops including one where you can build your very own quadcopter,
silent auction, adult beverages, and lots of other fun activities you don't
want to miss out on. We are also coordinating with SANS this year and will
have a sign-up sheet at our conference with limited availability for free
access to SANS at Night evening talks the week following B-Sides Orlando.
Tickets are $20 for normal attendees, and free for students with a valid ID
or SANS attendees with a valid registration for the Orlando 2015
conference. If you want to reserve your spot for our April 11-12th event
please go to http://bsidesorlando.eventbrite.com
<https://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbsidesorlando%2Eeventbrite%2Ecom&urlhash=-RY-&_t=tracking_anet>

Again thanks for helping to contribute to the continued success of B-Sides
Orlando and we hope to see you there!

-Tony Turner and the rest of the B-Sides Orlando Coordinators
