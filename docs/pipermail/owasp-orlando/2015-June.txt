Subject: [Owasp-orlando] Co-Leader and Officer Openings
Message-ID: <CAFm0_mz4gfn_=86V_RnjO9w7vsUrfS5yTsFyV841Yo76R=Hxtw@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to thank Jon Singer for his assistance over the last couple years
as chapter Co-Leader. Jon is moving to Tampa and getting more involved in
things over there and we need a new Co-Leader to help me keep things on
track. Historically we've only met 3 out of 4 quarters each year and I'd
like to make some changes there to increase chapter activity and meeting
frequency as long as we can maintain the high quality standards we've
enjoyed so far.

Activities we need some help with:

   - Organizing meetings
   - Sponsor wrangling
   - Speaker wrangling
   - Projects coordination
   - Communications outreach (including social media)
   - Planning committee for upcoming regional or national conference in 2017
   - Content

To this end I'd like volunteers for the positions of:

   - Co-Leader - Assist the Chapter Leader (Tony Turner) with the
   continuity of chapter operations, run chapter meetings, overall strategic
   direction of chapter and function in an operational leadership capacity.
   Free attendance to AppSecUSA conference and other national AppSec events
   and training is a huge perk for Co-Leaders
   - Events and Marketing Director - Coordination of Chapter events, venue,
   speakers and sponsors. Maintaining social media channels such as
   Meetup.com, Linkedin, etc and facilitating communication with the community
   for event promotion
   - Content Directors (Chief Breaking, Defending and Building Officers) -
   Responsible for content quality, weeding out the sales oriented
   presentations, workshop planning and ensuring content delivery is balanced
   across all 3 disciplines and is relevant for membership. Content Directors
   will also support relevant project activities for their respective
   discipline.

Please respond by July 15th if you intend to fulfill one of these roles and
I will announce the new officers by the end of July.
