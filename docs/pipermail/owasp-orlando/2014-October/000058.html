<PRE>Hello all, just wanted to let you know if you haven't seen it already, we
will be holding our next meeting Nov 12 at 6 PM on UCF campus. While we do
have one speaker we are still looking for a second. If you've been looking
for an opportunity to present on something you are working on or just have
an interest related to application security you want to share let Jon
Singer or I know.

*Q4 2014 Meeting November 12*

We will be holding our Q4 meeting on Wednesday, November 12th at The
University of Central Florida, main campus. We are currently looking for
speakers.

There is NO cost to attend. Refreshments and snacks are provided by
HeroiSec.
Guest Speakers

*Blog like a hacker - Vikram Dhillon*
People just entering information security have a tough path ahead to become
established and well-known. One major tool that almost all well known
security analysts have is a blog where they all reach out to their
audience. Getting a blog on a popular CMS platform is easy and of course
great and all but you can't show your own skills off. Enter Jekyll. A blog
written from scratch up where you can show off your own development skills.
Most developers are using their own styling along with various plugins
combined in this Ruby-based tool to show off how they can blog like a
hacker. This session will be a walkthrough of how to blog using jekyll. I
will showcase what the finished project looks like, how to get started with
one, the structure of the app and finally how to extend the blog you've
created with your own imagination.
