Subject: [Owasp-orlando] Heartbleed SSL vuln
Message-ID: <CAFm0_mwHyxcrRPfbpAiomVPuptz2HZpHF5kmwY=XUnhrznN88A@mail.gmail.com>

List, I don't usually communicate vulns to the group but this one is pretty
bad. If you have not already tested your sites for this flaw and patched,
you really should do it ASAP. It's one of the worst if not the worst SSL
vuln I've ever seen. The SANS Internet Storm Center threat level has been
elevated to yellow, which happens so rarely that I used to have an
interview question asking what the threat level was today because it's
almost always green.
