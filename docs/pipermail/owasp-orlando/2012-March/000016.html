<PRE>Good afternoon OWASP Orlando!

Last week we had a very successful Q1 meeting, especially given the poor
weather and it being our first real meeting. Jim Manico and Tom Brennan
delivered some excellent content around OWASP History and 2012 Roadmap and
Effective XSS Defenses to help get things going for 2012. As soon as I get
copies of the presentations that were done I'll be posting them on our site
at <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando</A>

For Q2 I'm also very excited to announce we will have Jack Mannino, CEO of
nVisium Security and Co-Leader of the OWASP Mobile Security Project coming
to speak about Mobile Security. We also have another speaker from a
database security company that has offered to give a talk on SQL Injection
and future defenses and as soon as I'm positive that it won't be a vendor
pitch I'll be confirming them as well. Unlike some information security
groups, OWASP does not tolerate vendor-centric content and we need to
self-police to ensure that the materials being presented are vendor neutral
and are consistent with the intent of an open community. The Q2 meeting
will be some time in May, most likely in the first half and as soon as we
have dates confirmed I'll let the list know and post it on the chapter wiki.

I also want to announce that Bill Riggins, a local developer, penetration
tester and all around great guy has accepted my offer to co-lead the OWASP
Orlando chapter. I'll let him make a bit more formal introduction himself
as I'm not 100% how much of what I know of him is public knowledge and what
is better left for trawlers of archive.org and the Google cache. Bill can
be reached at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-orlando">bill.riggins at owasp.org</A>

Welcome Bill!

As always, if you have any special requests for future content, want to
suggest a speaker or speak yourself or are just interested in being more
involved with the chapter please let Bill and myself know. Lastly, while it
is not required to attend any OWASP Orlando events, it does cost money to
run a chapter and we greatly appreciate those of you who have already
contributed financially to the chapter. For more information on becoming
a paying member or an organizational or chapter sponsor, please visit
