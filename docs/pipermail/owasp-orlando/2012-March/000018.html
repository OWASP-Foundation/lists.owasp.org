<PRE>Thanks Tony! I definitely appreciate the opportunity to assist with leading this chapter, and hope that together, as a community, we can improve the awareness of developers in our area. I strongly believe that the creation of this Orlando chapter of OWASP is an important milestone in the development of Orlando's security community. I look forward to meeting all of you at the next meeting, and working with you to better educate developers and security professionals across the Central Florida area.

My background is primarily in application development, but more recently has been shifting towards security and penetration testing. Much of my past at Lockheed Martin has been spent working with developers, team leads, and programs to educate them on the need for secure application development processes, procedures, and standards. I assisted in the development of secure coding blueprints, training courses, and security testing guides that are now in the hands of developers across the company. Much of that content was inspired or based on OWASP material, which really makes this feel like closing the circuit.

Thank you,
Bill Riggins

&gt;<i> Good afternoon OWASP Orlando!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Last week we had a very successful Q1 meeting, especially given the poor weather and it being our first real meeting. Jim Manico and Tom Brennan delivered some excellent content around OWASP History and 2012 Roadmap and Effective XSS Defenses to help get things going for 2012. As soon as I get copies of the presentations that were done I'll be posting them on our site at <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For Q2 I'm also very excited to announce we will have Jack Mannino, CEO of nVisium Security and Co-Leader of the OWASP Mobile Security Project coming to speak about Mobile Security. We also have another speaker from a database security company that has offered to give a talk on SQL Injection and future defenses and as soon as I'm positive that it won't be a vendor pitch I'll be confirming them as well. Unlike some information security groups, OWASP does not tolerate vendor-centric content and we need to self-police to ensure that the materials being presented are vendor neutral and are consistent with the intent of an open community. The Q2 meeting will be some time in May, most likely in the first half and as soon as we have dates confirmed I'll let the list know and post it on the chapter wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also want to announce that Bill Riggins, a local developer, penetration tester and all around great guy has accepted my offer to co-lead the OWASP Orlando chapter. I'll let him make a bit more formal introduction himself as I'm not 100% how much of what I know of him is public knowledge and what is better left for trawlers of archive.org and the Google cache. Bill can be reached at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-orlando">bill.riggins at owasp.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome Bill!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As always, if you have any special requests for future content, want to suggest a speaker or speak yourself or are just interested in being more involved with the chapter please let Bill and myself know. Lastly, while it is not required to attend any OWASP Orlando events, it does cost money to run a chapter and we greatly appreciate those of you who have already contributed financially to the chapter.
