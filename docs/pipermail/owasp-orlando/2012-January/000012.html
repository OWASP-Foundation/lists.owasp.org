<PRE>Hello fellow OWASP Orlando members,

I assume many of you are already familiar with the Top 10 either due to
existing work with OWASP, PCI, or any of the numerous statutes that
reference the Top 10. It occurs to me that many technical topics at OWASP
meetings are based on the understanding that the audience is at least
familiar. In order to establish a baseline for these discussions I wanted
to provide some resources for those of you who wish to learn more about
these very prevalent security issues. The first is a link to the category
page at OWASP for all things Top 10. The 2nd link is a video of Dave
Wichers giving his talk on the RC1 of the 2010 Top 10 at OWASP Appsec USA
in 2009. Don't worry, it's still quite relevant today.

Later this year I'd like to hold a series of workshops on the Top 10 in
conjunction with local Ruby, PHP, .NET, Java, etc. developer groups with a
focus on specific code examples relevant to the audience. I don't currently
have a lot of contacts with many other dev user groups in the area so would
appreciate any assistance you can provide to not only grow the chapter but
to get the word out on these very important appsec topics, which is the
real reason why we formed this chapter. If none of you are active in this
space that's fine, we will reach out to them. I am fairly active with the
ISSA and ISACA chapters and they seem to be picking up steam. Myself and
some other colleagues in the area are discussing the possibility of a new
low cost IT Security/Hacking conference in Orlando for 2013. The local
Defcon DC407 chapter which I'm also very active in has seen some recent new
blood and an ISC2 chapter has recently formed as well but I have not had
the time to check them out yet. I'm looking forward to the coming year. It
should be very exciting for Orlando infosec!
