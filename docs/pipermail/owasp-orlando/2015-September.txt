Hi William,

Active is a relative term. Yes we are still alive, no we have not had a
meeting in quite some time. We hope to get one on the calendar very soon,
and my efforts of late have largely been focused on chapter restructuring,
adding officers, standardizing meeting schedules and venues, and other
strategic activities. I'll be sending out an email on this later this week.
Any meeting announcements will occur on this mailing list, at the wiki
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando at our meetup page
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Orlando/ and via our linkedin group
https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=4041380

Thanks for your interest and we hope to see you at one of our upcoming
meetings!

Hello everyone, I wanted to announce that we have selected our new officers
for the chapter and we have a full house now. You will see some additional
changes in the next few weeks including a new meeting schedule and some new
content formats. More on this later!

For now I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce you to our new
officers and one of our former officers (Welcome back Willa!):

Adrian Pastor - Chapter Co-Leader
Michael Felch - Chief Breaker Officer
Jack Norman - Chief Builder Officer
Willa Riggins - Marketing Coordinator and Prior Chapter Co-Leader 2012-2013

Additionally I will be taking on the role of Chief Defender Officer in
addition to my Chapter Leader role which I've held since I founded the
chapter in 2011. I won't pretend to be able to do as great a job at doing
introductions as each of these fine people so I'll let them each tell you a
little about themselves.

Lastly I wanted to thank Jon Singer for his service since 2013 as Co-Lead
and wish him all the luck over in his new home, Tampa, FL. I suspect we
will be hearing great things from him shortly!

Hey all,

I'm Jack Norman, and I am the Information Security Engineer in charge of
AppSec at HD Supply. Before I joined HD Supply (two months ago), I was a
Sr. Software Engineer and Information Assurance guy at L3 Communications
for 12 years. As far as schooling, I have lived by the rule "If my job will
keep paying ...I'll keep going" for the last eight years, and in that time,
I have knocked out an Executive MBA, MS in Information Assurance and Cyber
Security, and a Certificate in Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
Now I am focused on knocking out my CISSP, taking the GPEN in the spring,
and doing a bunch of geeking out on projects at home.

When I'm not working or geeking out, I'm usually chasing around my four
year old daughter, doing CrossFit, or volunteering for upstanding
organizations like this one!

I'm looking forward to getting things moving with this chapter of OWASP.

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn:

Thanks!
Jack

Hi --

My name is Mike Felch and I'm the Lead Pentester and Sr. Manager for
Fortress Information Security in Orlando. I started my career as a Linux
admin before switching gears as a Software Engineer and eventually Security
Engineer/Pentesting. My strengths are in offensive security, reverse
engineering/exploit development, and vulnerability research. I am the Lead
Instructor for an advanced mobile device forensics course with TeelTech and
also a member of the USSS ECTF.

I look forward to working with everyone here to make OWASP Orlando a great
chapter!

You can find me on LinkedIn at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelfelch

Thanks,
Mike

Orlando OWASPers,

I'm Willa Riggins; former co-chapter lead and BSides Orlando social media
lady. I currently work for Veracode as a Senior Penetration Tester and
previously worked on Lockheed Martin's Red Team. My prior experience runs
the gamut of the SDLC from design through development, testing, and
retirement. I am excited to get involved with the chapter again (my toddler
is finally ... mobile, very mobile) and look forward to driving the
frontier of application security forward.

When I'm not breaking things, I can be found at Greater Orlando's
hackerspace, FamiLAB, up in Longwood -- that or chasing my toddler. :)

Thank you,
Willa Riggins

Hello list!

My name is Adrian Pastor. I moved from Oxford, UK to central FL less than a year ago and am really keen to meet InfoSec pros, students, and hobbyists in the area.

I've been passionate about security since witnessing the (authorized) execution of an exploit (WinNuke NetBIOS OOB) for the first time at an Internet caf? in my early teens.

I work as a consultant specializing in identifying and assessing technical and business security risks and advising organizations on implementing security controls that align with their business goals. I often act as an interface between technical personnel and business stakeholders such as process owners and senior management.

In my free time, I enjoy bug hunting and creating web wargames. Outside security, I love to travel and trying dishes from different regions of the world.

I look forward to meeting and serving OWASP attendees and officers alike. Please let me know if there is anything you need; I'm here to help! :-)

Best,
ap
