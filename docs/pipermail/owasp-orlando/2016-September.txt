Hello OWASP Orlando!

On 09/29, we?re having a social meeting to network, meet fellow OWASPers,
and reach out to the central Florida developer community. In addition to
free food and beverages, we?ll give away some OWASP swag.

The location for our social meeting will be Downtown PourHouse, at 20 S
Orange Ave, Orlando. We?ll meet from 5:30 PM to 8 PM approximately, or as
late as people want to stay.
