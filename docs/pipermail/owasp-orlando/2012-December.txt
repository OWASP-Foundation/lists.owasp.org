I just came across this site
https://www.htbridge.com/cvss_web_calculator/which appears to be a
pretty useful resource to calculate CVSS scores for
various web vulns. Obviously you will need to take context for your own
environment into consideration when using the tool. I'd welcome any
thoughts on it's applicability for the issues you commonly see.

Happy Holidays!
