Subject: [Owasp-orlando] Need Core Team Members AppSecUSA 2017
Message-ID: <CAFm0_myFu58vU5VRzYXw_xzj2dPehO2bZA5RR7GuK9NJTEQbTg@mail.gmail.com>

We need volunteers to manage the following activities for AppSecUSA in
Orlando this September. I'm reaching out to Orlando and Tampa chapters
first. You will obtain "free" admission to the conference and our undying
appreciation for your efforts. Work begins prior to the event of course,
but onsite activities are very impactful so we'd like to ensure continuity
from now until then so only volunteer if you can actually commit 5+ hours a
week from now until late September.

Activities Coordinator - Run Call for Activities and wrangle activity
leads. Coordinate on scheduling. Ensure activities run smoothly

Volunteer Coordinator - Manage the list of volunteers, assign as needed,
and support onsite conference operations. You will be herding cats.

Speaker Coordinator - While OWASP staff will manage notification and some
onsite support to be determined, you will be the local staff point of
contact for all speaker needs

There will be more opportunities for volunteering if none of these appeal
to you, but we'd like to start here and appreciate all your support.

Please send any emails offering assistance to appsecusa2017 at googlegroups.com


Thanks everyone!
