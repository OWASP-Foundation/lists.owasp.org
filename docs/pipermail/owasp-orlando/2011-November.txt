Subject: [Owasp-orlando] Dec 5 OWASP Tampa chapter meeting
Message-ID: <CAFm0_mxUnAkfM0yFeqZOMz0LqD-xDe8QoMNfm21q0HEC4afHCA@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone interested in attending Jack Mannino's "How Not to Build Android
Apps" presentation in Ybor on December 5th? I'm going to be driving over
and have room for 2 or 3 more if you'd like to ride with me. I'll be
leaving from the airport so will probably ask folks to meet me somewhere
along S Semoran near the airport.

If you plan on coming please send Justin Morehouse an email before December
2 so he can have you added to the security list (see cc)
