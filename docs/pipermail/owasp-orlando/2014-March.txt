Just dropping the list a message to let everyone know who doesn't already
about the B-Sides Orlando Security conference this weekend in Orlando at
the Wyndham Resort off sand lake and I drive. You seriously should check it
out, best training value in town and a raucous good time! Great talks,
great friends, free beer, live entertainment, lockpick village, capture the
flag, bug bounty and much more!

$20 is cheap for 2 days of a great conference. Come out, you won't be
disappointed!
