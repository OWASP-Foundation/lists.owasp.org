FYI - If you have a competitive spirit this could be a good way to prove
your skills and win a seat at a regional AppSec conference for 2012. Even
if you don't think you will win, this is a great playground to work on your
web appsec kung fu.

Good morning OWASP Orlando!

Bill and I are eagerly planning for the next meeting on May 15th and we
wanted to announce that this month, the appsec trivia contest as part of
the opening remarks will include 6 month access to The Hacker
Academy<http://www.thehackeracademy.com/>online training. I did a
review of their curriculum at
ethicalhacker.net awhile back that you can find
HERE<http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/374/2/>.
You will need to be present and participate in the trivia contest to win.

We also wanted to remind everyone that Fishnet is providing food for this
event but we need an accurate registration count to properly plan for food
purchasing. Several of you have contacted me to tell me you were planning
on attending but I did not see an associated registration. We've got a
couple of weeks until the meeting but I will be placing food orders by the
13th. Please register before then if you have not done so already.

We look forward to seeing you all at the next meeting May 15th!

-Tony
