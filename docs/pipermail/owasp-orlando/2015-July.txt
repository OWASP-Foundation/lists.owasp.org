Hello OWASP Orlando,

Just a friendly reminder to let me know by July 15th if you intend to fill
one of these volunteer positions. We've had a couple people speak up but
can definitely use more help. Thanks!

Both of these organizations have offered OWASP expo space at their upcoming

August 5 - August 6. This is a wonderful outreach opportunity for us to
promote our projects, chapters, events, tools, programs, membership, etc.
to thousands of people who share the same interests and concerns as we do
about security.  Also included are a few passes to each event :)  By
donating some of your time to help at either of the booths, you can earn
yourself a pass.

*BSides-LasVegas*
If you volunteer a total of 6 hours at the OWASP BSides booth over the
course of the 2 days, you will receive 1 supporting charity badge. *Please
note that these passes are limited and are on a first come first serve
basis*.

*BlackHat* *USA*
Volunteer 9 hours at the OWASP BlackHat booth over the 2 days and receive 1
full conference badge to BlackHatUSA. *Please note that these passes are
limited and are on a first come first serve basis.* *You must volunteer a
total of 9 hours*.

Volunteer 6 hours at the OWASP BlackHat booth over the 2 days and receive 1
expo only badge to BlackHatUSA. *Please note that these passes are limited
