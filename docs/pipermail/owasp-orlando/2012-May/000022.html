<PRE>Good morning OWASP Orlando!

Bill and I are eagerly planning for the next meeting on May 15th and we
wanted to announce that this month, the appsec trivia contest as part of
the opening remarks will include 6 month access to The Hacker
Academy&lt;<A HREF="http://www.thehackeracademy.com/">http://www.thehackeracademy.com/</A>&gt;online training. I did a
review of their curriculum at
ethicalhacker.net awhile back that you can find
HERE&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/374/2/">http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/374/2/</A>&gt;.
You will need to be present and participate in the trivia contest to win.

We also wanted to remind everyone that Fishnet is providing food for this
event but we need an accurate registration count to properly plan for food
purchasing. Several of you have contacted me to tell me you were planning
on attending but I did not see an associated registration. We've got a
couple of weeks until the meeting but I will be placing food orders by the
13th. Please register before then if you have not done so already.

We look forward to seeing you all at the next meeting May 15th!

-Tony

&gt;<i> Good afternoon OWASP Orlando,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have posted details of our May 15th meeting at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando</A> and made some other cosmetic
</I>&gt;<i> updates to the wiki, including a supporters section since we've been
</I>&gt;<i> fortunate enough to have some financial and meeting location support from
</I>&gt;<i> the community. I wanted to thank Security Innovation, Fishnet Security and
</I>&gt;<i> UCF College of Medicine for their support so far. Without their assistance
</I>&gt;<i> none of this would be possible. We've also added a single chapter meeting
</I>&gt;<i> supporter link at <A HREF="http://regonline.com/owasp-orlando-sponsor">http://regonline.com/owasp-orlando-sponsor</A> for those
</I>&gt;<i> who wish to have a more budget-friendly way to support the chapter and have
</I>&gt;<i> changed our registration page from Eventbrite to the <A HREF="http://regonline.comservice">http://regonline.comservice</A> provided to OWASP for our use. This will allow us to better track
</I>&gt;<i> donations and expenditures from multiple sources and integrate the
</I>&gt;<i> financial aspects of the chapter with monies spent and received through the
</I>&gt;<i> parent organization. This is also where individual and organizational
</I>&gt;<i> supporter monies get processed through. For those of you interested in the
</I>&gt;<i> various membership options, you can check out
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A> for more info. We've also
</I>&gt;<i> added a presentation archive on the wiki where Bill or I will try to get
</I>&gt;<i> past presentations posted so you can share the content with others who may
</I>&gt;<i> have missed the meeting or if you'd just like to revisit the content
</I>&gt;<i> afterwards for your own purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
