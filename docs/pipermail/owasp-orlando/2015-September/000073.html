<PRE>Hello list!

My name is Adrian Pastor. I moved from Oxford, UK to central FL less than a year ago and am really keen to meet InfoSec pros, students, and hobbyists in the area.

I've been passionate about security since witnessing the (authorized) execution of an exploit (WinNuke NetBIOS OOB) for the first time at an Internet caf&#233; in my early teens.

I work as a consultant specializing in identifying and assessing technical and business security risks and advising organizations on implementing security controls that align with their business goals. I often act as an interface between technical personnel and business stakeholders such as process owners and senior management.

In my free time, I enjoy bug hunting and creating web wargames. Outside security, I love to travel and trying dishes from different regions of the world.

I look forward to meeting and serving OWASP attendees and officers alike. Please let me know if there is anything you need; I'm here to help! :-)

Best,
ap

</I>&gt;<i> Hello everyone, I wanted to announce that we have selected our new officers for the chapter and we have a full house now. You will see some additional changes in the next few weeks including a new meeting schedule and some new content formats. More on this later!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For now I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce you to our new officers and one of our former officers (Welcome back Willa!):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adrian Pastor - Chapter Co-Leader
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Felch - Chief Breaker Officer
</I>&gt;<i> Jack Norman - Chief Builder Officer
</I>&gt;<i> Willa Riggins - Marketing Coordinator and Prior Chapter Co-Leader 2012-2013
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally I will be taking on the role of Chief Defender Officer in addition to my Chapter Leader role which I've held since I founded the chapter in 2011. I won't pretend to be able to do as great a job at doing introductions as each of these fine people so I'll let them each tell you a little about themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly I wanted to thank Jon Singer for his service since 2013 as Co-Lead and wish him all the luck over in his new home, Tampa, FL. I suspect we will be hearing great things from him shortly!
