<PRE>Good afternoon OWASP Orlando,

We have posted details of our May 15th meeting at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Orlando</A> and made some other cosmetic
updates to the wiki, including a supporters section since we've been
fortunate enough to have some financial and meeting location support from
the community. I wanted to thank Security Innovation, Fishnet Security and
UCF College of Medicine for their support so far. Without their assistance
none of this would be possible. We've also added a single chapter meeting
supporter link at <A HREF="http://regonline.com/owasp-orlando-sponsor">http://regonline.com/owasp-orlando-sponsor</A> for those who
wish to have a more budget-friendly way to support the chapter and have
changed our registration page from Eventbrite to the
<A HREF="http://regonline.comservice">http://regonline.comservice</A> provided to OWASP for our use. This will
allow us to better track
donations and expenditures from multiple sources and integrate the
financial aspects of the chapter with monies spent and received through the
parent organization. This is also where individual and organizational
supporter monies get processed through. For those of you interested in the
various membership options, you can check out
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A> for more info. We've also added
a presentation archive on the wiki where Bill or I will try to get past
presentations posted so you can share the content with others who may have
missed the meeting or if you'd just like to revisit the content afterwards
for your own purposes.

Now on to the details of our next meeting.
