Hello folks, I'm still working on the details for the next meeting, but I
wanted to extend an offer to the chapter as well as ask for assistance. We
have been offered booth space at http://fossetcon.org/ Sept 11-13 and I
need volunteers to man the booth.

You will be granted free access to the event in exchange for taking a shift
at our booth. You don't have to be an AppSec guru or OWASP master to
volunteer. We just need people to engage the conference attendees and get
conversations started about OWASP, tell people about the good work we and
many others are doing globally under the OWASP banner and meet interesting
people!

Please let me know if you'd be interested and I'll get you the details.

Thanks everyone. We are good on volunteers now. I appreciate the support.
Even if you aren't volunteering, there's some good talks scheduled at
Fossetcon you might want to check out.
