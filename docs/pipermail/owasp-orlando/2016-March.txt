Subject: [Owasp-orlando] Call for Volunteers B-Sides Orlando
Message-ID: <CAFm0_mx8wdiFn49ch-XWUHbHEbTwH0cUtJ-08GuzQJgq49vQ7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone, I know this is last minute but we've had some volunteers for
B-Sides back out recently and need to quickly fill some slots. The Security
B-Sides Orlando conference is this weekend at UCF and they've asked us
(technically I've asked us since I founded and help run that event as well)
to help find some more volunteers for the conference. Attendance is free
for volunteers or students ($20 for normal attendees) and its a great way
to meet other members of the community. If you are interested, please fill
out the form at http://bsidesorlando.org/2016/registration/volunteer

Also, if you are interested in working a shift at the OWASP table, please
get in touch. Thanks!
