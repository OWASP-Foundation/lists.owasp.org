Subject: [Owasp-orlando] Security B-Sides Orlando March 12-13
Message-ID: <CAFm0_mwdpxwvCp3M12KEEhLfiuyBiTWv4EYSFYVxjx4obnxPqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Shameless plug for B-Sides Orlando, an annual event I founded in 2013 with
some good friends (including other OWASP'ers) and help run. Go grab a
ticket, its $20 for normal attendees and no cost (free) for students with a
valid ID.

http://bsidesorlando.org/2016/

We (the chapter) will be out at the conference on the UCF campus, its a
good time with great topics, lockpick village, a CTF, free booze and great
conversation. We are looking for volunteers to staff the OWASP table so get
in touch with me if you'd like to help there.

Several sponsors will be there looking for new recruits, so bring your
resumes if you are looking for new opportunities. The event is very much
focused on security practitioners with a large student demographic. These
are technical people or people looking to bolster career opportunities,
this is not an RSA style management event or a vendor-centric sales
conference. No contact details are shared with sponsors so no
post-conference spam. We've also partnered with SANS and attendees will
have the opportunity to attends SANS Orlando SANS @night sessions for free
the week following Bsides as well as other opportunities you will have to
show up to discover!

Contact info at bsidesorlando.org for more information about the event.

Thanks!
