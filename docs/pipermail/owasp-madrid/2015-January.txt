Hi OWASP Leaders:

Please pass the following information on to your project and chapter
members:

The KBA-MP Project seeks participants with identity management and/or
standards development experience. Join here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Knowledge_Based_Authentication_Performance_Metrics_Project

The KBAPM Project

There is a lack of standard performance metrics regarding the use of
knowledge based authentication (KBA) for remote identity proofing. KBAPMP's
goal is to establish standard performance metrics for knowledge based
authentication.
What is Knowledge Based Authentication?

Knowledge-based authentication, commonly referred to as KBA, is a method of
authentication which seeks to prove the identity of someone accessing a
service, such as a website. As the name suggests, KBA requires the
knowledge of personal information of the individual to grant access to the
protected material. There are two types of KBA: "static KBA", which is
based on a pre-agreed set of "shared secrets"; and "dynamic KBA", which is
based on questions generated from a wider base of personal information.
KBAPM Project Supports the NSTIC Guiding Principles

KBAPM Project is dedicated to developing KBA Standards in alignment the the
NSTIC Guiding Principle. To that end KBAPM Project has answered the IDESG
Standards Committee Solicitation to develop Knowledge Based Authentication
Performance Metric Standards.


For more information contact the Project Leader, Ann Racuya-Robbins, at

Thanks!
