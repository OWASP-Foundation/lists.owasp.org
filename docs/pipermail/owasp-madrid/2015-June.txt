*OWASP SUMMER CODE SPRINT 2015 *

*OWASP Summer Code Sprint 2015 is a program that aims to provide
opportunities and incentives for students to gain experience with
Application Security coding as 'interns' contributing to OWASP projects.
We call this our Summer Sprint since it is a very short term initiative.
Students will gain valuable experience over the July-August timeframe.*
