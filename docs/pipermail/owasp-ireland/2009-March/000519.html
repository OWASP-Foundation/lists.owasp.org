<PRE>Hi Eoin/List,

I just wanted to throw a question out there based on some questions I've
received recently about chapter meetings. I was wondering if we planned
on making the chapter meetings more frequent than we had in 2008? I
think we only had 2 in the whole year (correct me if I'm wrong) and I
feel it would be more beneficial to have them more frequently, every 2-3
months?

What does everyone else think?

Dave
