Hi,
The OWASP Live CD  (Release Candidate 1) is available.
It contains many of the OWASP tools and also the new Testing guide and the
development Guide.
It also has learning tools such as webgoat, some exploit engines
(metasploit) and tools such as wireshark and other information gathering
tools.
I'll be demoing it at the next meeting (13th Feb) anyways.
Its not a small download (circa 800MB). available at
http://www.packetfocus.com/hackos/AOC_Labrat-ALPHA-0010.iso

cya,
Eoin

Free: Cygwin + openssh should work fine. If you want a package for this, you
could update the sshwindows project (http://sshwindows.sf.net), which is a
bit outdated; currently at openssh 3.8.1p1, needs repackaging, not a complex
task.

Free: alternative to sftp might be a host-to-host IPSec, with a policy
restricting access to FTP flows. Advantage of this is that no extra software
is required, but management complexity might be a factor if you're planning
on growing this to a large number of sites. Perhaps no more complex that
managing ssh client and key deployments. Of course, you're still using ftp
and your requirements may be different from the security characteristics
afforded by a host-to-host IPSec solution.

Not familiar with any of these as cygwin+openssh has proved reliable.
However, you could also try ssh.com as another commercial source.

Hi All,

Long time reader :)

What must one consider as the Security Musts when using a Shopping Cart
