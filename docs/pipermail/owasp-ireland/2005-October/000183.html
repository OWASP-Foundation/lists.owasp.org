<PRE>Hi,
 One thing that really bugs me about the new chip and pin system is way in
which the pin is entered. Some of the terminals such as those in
supermarkets offer little in the way of privacy when inputting the pin. Up
to now pins have been mostly used at ATM's where your body is a good
physical screen, but now usually the terminal is between you and the
retailer, more often than not in plain view of other cusomers too. 
A step back for pin security???

BBC has an article on Chip and Pin and the affect it has had on card fraud,
as mentioned by Chris at his PCI presentation last meeting. 
- might be &quot;marketing guff&quot;? Chris, any comments?
