<PRE>Hi Tony,

 

In general, the requirements for the &quot;privacy shield&quot; for pin entry devices
were relaxed since PCI PED superseded Visa's VisaPED specs. 

Germany, having the most stringent PED security requirements in
Europe/worldwide, has not relaxed their requirements.

 

AFAIK, this relaxation is partly related to accessibility and disability
requirements/specifications.

 

PCI PED and VisaPED specify things like the minimum angle from the '5' key
(5 being the middle key on the keypad) to the top of the wall of the privacy
shield above and to the sides of the '5' key.

 

For handheld terminals, the requirements for the privacy shield are also
relaxed - the rationale being that the user can use their body as a shield
when they are holding the terminal.

 

See VisaPED section 3.4 Privacy Shield Requirement:

Subject: RE: [OWASP-Ireland] chip &amp; pin

 

Hi,

 One thing that really bugs me about the new chip and pin system is way in
which the pin is entered. Some of the terminals such as those in
supermarkets offer little in the way of privacy when inputting the pin. Up
to now pins have been mostly used at ATM's where your body is a good
physical screen, but now usually the terminal is between you and the
retailer, more often than not in plain view of other cusomers too. 

A step back for pin security???

BBC has an article on Chip and Pin and the affect it has had on card fraud,
as mentioned by Chris at his PCI presentation last meeting. 
- might be &quot;marketing guff&quot;? Chris, any comments?
