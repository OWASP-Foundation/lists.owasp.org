<PRE>All,

I think there is the making of another event on authentication similar
to the one that was done on centralised logging. Is anyone interested in
looking at this?

Phishing attacks have really put username/password under pressure. The
banks and similar businesses are looking at increasing the level of
authentication strength. Technologies such as tokens, smartcards and
certificates certainly deliver strong authentication but the service
providers balk at the cost, the complexity of managing the registration
and distribution of tokens (or whatever it is that you have). A key
requirement of suppliers of consumer service is that they are easy to
use - it is no use putting in strong authentication if no one uses the
service.

There are new approaches available now, like the scratch card mechanism
referred to by Eoin, or Entrust's
<A HREF="http://www.entrust.com/identityguard/index.htm">http://www.entrust.com/identityguard/index.htm</A> and technologies based on
mobile phones.

I don't want to speak for the banks but their problem is not from the
losses that they are suffering due to phishing but from the low growth
of users of their online service. Research has shown that the take up of
Internet banking has stagnated and there is evidence that this is due to
the lack of confidence that potential consumers have in the service. I
wouldn't like this event to be limited to banking; the issues apply to
any business that offers an online service that could be the target of
fraud.

I thought that an event similar to a debate where a number of people
take the position of one type of technology might be a good way of
getting to the issues. No one technology is going to fit every
application but this approach might be good at flushing out the pros and
cons.

I realise this email could constitute an offer to help organise this,
but I am sure that following the excellent job that Cormac did with the
logging event that he might take this one too? :-)

Subject: Re: [OWASP-Ireland] Phishing One-time passwords

Interesting in this case was the fact that each customer was given a
card from which they could scratch off their OTP.  Users were duped into
entering their latest OTP into a fake site.  So another weak link here
is that the passwords were pregenerated and had no expiration.

One-Time passwords are meant to be more secure but the weak link is
people (Tell me something I don't know).
