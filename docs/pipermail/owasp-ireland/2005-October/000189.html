Here's another site for your bookmarks!

The goal of the &quot;Build Security In&quot; project is to &quot;alter the way that software is developed so it is less vulnerable to attack and security is &quot;built in&quot; from the start &quot;. It is sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security and the aim seems to be to make it pretty comprehensive, covering topics from risk management through to testing plus training and awareness. Having said that, a lot of the internal links are still empty.
