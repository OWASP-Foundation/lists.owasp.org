<PRE>More &quot;chip and spin&quot; methinks...

As covered in the presentation, chip &amp; pin address Card Present
transactions, not Card Not present transactions. (Though there is some
work/pilots underway that address CNP transactions with the aid of an
additional &quot;box&quot; that the user plugs their chip and pin card into to buy
their goods online or whatever.)

So as the article reports, fraud has reduced 29% for CP transactions.
However... if we look at the bigger picture then it tells a different story.

 

Some key statements from the article:

&quot;However, the figures are incomplete as they do not include card fraud over
the telephone or internet.&quot; i.e. CNP. 

In addition, the figures do not include fraud committed when cards go
missing in the post. &quot; 

Those missing figures (from the same APACS report) are as follows:

*          &quot;CNP fraud continues to be the biggest fraud type, rising 24%
last year to GBP150.8m approx 30% of total card fraud.&quot;

*          &quot;Fraud on cards stolen before the genuine cardholders receive
them grew sharply - up 62% to GBP 72.9m - as criminals took advantage of the
unusually high number of cards sent out due to the rollout of new chip and
pin cards&quot;: 280,000 cards sent per day at peak.

BBC has an article on Chip and Pin and the affect it has had on card fraud,
as mentioned by Chris at his PCI presentation last meeting. 
- might be &quot;marketing guff&quot;? Chris, any comments?
