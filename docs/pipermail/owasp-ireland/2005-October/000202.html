<PRE>Interesting in this case was the fact that each customer was given a card from which they could scratch off their OTP.  Users were duped into entering their latest OTP into a fake site.  So another weak link here is that the passwords were pregenerated and had no expiration.

One-Time passwords are meant to be more secure but the weak link is people (Tell me something I don't know).
