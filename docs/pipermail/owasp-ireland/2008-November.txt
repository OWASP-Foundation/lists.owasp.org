Hi Folks

A while back some of you took part in a survey I was running on whether or
not Ireland should have a Computer Emergency Response Team.  Well thanks to
the feedback from the OWASP Ireland members and others I am happy to say
that the first national Computer Emergency Response Team was launched today.
The CERT service will be run under the auspices of the Irish Reporting and
Information Security Service (IRISS) www.iriss.ie.  

The Irish Reporting and Information Security Service (IRISS) is a not for
profit organisation manned by a group of volunteers made up from the best
information security professionals in the country providing the following
services;

- - Incident Reporting 
IRISS provides clients with a resource whereby computer security incidents
can be reported anonymously and in confidence.
  
- - Alerts and Warnings 
IRISS provides advanced alerts and warnings on potential vulnerabilities and
threats facing their information technology infrastructure. Where possible
these alerts will be tailored specifically for the Irish audience and also
to meet clients' requirements such as non-technical alerts for owner
managers of SMEs and more detailed technical alerts for IT specialists
working for larger firms.
  
- - Conduct Research
Research and surveys will be conducted on information security matters
within Ireland to get a better understanding as to what is happening in the
Irish Internet community. This should provide meaningful statistics to help
drive home some key messages to companies and raise security awareness
levels using statistics pertinent to the Irish market.
  
- - Sanitised Attack Notifications
IRISS provides an alerting service to companies regarding attacks that are
actively happening to other Irish companies so they can better prevent the
same attack happening to them.
  
- - Provide Guidelines and Advice
IRISS will provide clients with information, advice and best practises on
how to secure and manage the information technology platforms their
businesses are dependant on.  IRISS also supports a number of online forums
where clients can raise issues and queries with our experts or others within
our community.

The above range of services are available at no cost, thanks to our
sponsors, and you can sign up
https://www.iriss.ie/FWA5EIRE/Resources/Signup.aspx.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Microsoft SDL Optimisation Model
Message-ID: <491D9F3B.6090108@realexpayments.com>

Hi all,

Microsoft have released an optimisation for secure development life
cycles. It has 4 levels of maturity and has a self assessment guide
included in the download. You can get the optimisation model here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd221356.aspx

They have also released a new version of the Threat Modeling tool
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc421514.aspx) which rather
annoyingly requires Visio 2007 to be installed on your desktop! The tool
does look a lot better than the old one.

Ladies/Gents

Thanks all for coming to the chapter meeting on Tuesday night, I hope you
all got a little from it and the opportunity to meet your fellow security
practitioners was worth while.
I shall post the presentations on the Ireland chapter page over the coming
days and can also send out copies to anyone that requires an email copy.

Thanks to John Wood, David and Conor for their great presentations and for
John flying over from the UK to give the talk.

*OWASP (Ireland) Conference 2009*
OWASP Ireland are hoping to have a full one day event in Dublin city
centre.  I hope for it to consist of a number of tracks from technical to
business focus relating to Application security. I am currently in contact
with number of universities located in Dublin city centre regarding a venue.
If anyone wishes to get involved please drop me a line directly.
I shall require assistance in PR, advertising, sponsorship etc. One aim of
the conference is to get some "famous" speakers to attend and also raise
awareness of application security within Ireland.

OWASP also have an "*OWASP on Tour*" fund such that if the chapter requires
a speaker from abroad OWASP can fund the costs so...please feel free to send
me your requests and I'll see what I can do.

rgds,

Hello Chapter
One of our open source code review tools based on the code review guide has
been released:
details below:

Hello Eoin,

In case you have missed it, #Code Review sister tool# is available to be
downloaded via the Code Crawler Home Page:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Crawler


Changelog:

- Team Management (Schedule Code Reviews, Email Reports) removed due to
third party license that doesn't fit with OWASP "license". Most of the code
is still in there and it's likely to come back sooner or later.

- Improved Report Generation
       - Code Crawler now provide the functionality to print (read export)
previous made scans results. Depending  on the size of the source code the
size of the     CC directory is likely to grown up. If you are  planning to
run Code Crawler from a USB Stick please remember that a 256Mb should be
fine to store up        to (3000~ reports).

- Improved Scanning Engine

       - Everytime the application will scan your code an "xml shadow copy"
of file will be written via IO into the Code Crawler Folder.
       - Performance increased, (almost 1 second for 1k line of code)

- Code Crawer Objects Changes
       - Database Objects structure changed to introduce a new patch (#Line
of Code#), Code Crawler will now tells you the exact location of the
vulnerable code plus a more comprensive description.

- UI Changes:
       - Half of the UI has been re-designed
       - Welcome page (still some works to do in there)
       - OWASP Brower
       - OWASP KeyPointers tab removed (community feedbacks)

Direct Links:

http://www.cyphersec.com/software_archive/OWASP_Code_Crawler_Source.zip
#1,6Mb# #Visual Studio 2008#
http://www.cyphersec.com/software_archive/OWASP_Code_Crawler.zip #441kb#
#.NET Framwork 3 is required#

Message-ID: <49267BD4.6000802@realexpayments.com>

Hi all,

Kind of following on from the presentation that Conor McGoveran and I
brought to the chapter meeting on Tuesday I thought this might be of
interest to people:

http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Congress-Warned-Google-Privacy-Security/story.aspx?guid={1F38EBC3-45CE-4C93-9289-1FA76263AEE7}

In short, Google are trying to get congress to use its products so a
consumer watchdog group has been highlighting some of its many privacy
and security flaws.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Symantec Report on the Underground Economy
Message-ID: <492D2977.3090603@realexpayments.com>

Symantec usually include stats on underground data sales in their Threat
Report but they have now produced a separate report:

http://www.symantec.com/business/theme.jsp?themeid=threatreport

It is an interesting read, I recently did some research in this area and
I found it was very easy to buy this kind of data - if anyone wants more
details on my own research let me know.
