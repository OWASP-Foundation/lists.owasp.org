Eoin,

?90 is an amazing price for a conference like this, in this recession 
this is the perfect opportunity for people to get a great return on 
their investment - better than any bank can offer right now ;-)

Hi Dave,

The ?90 is great value seen as it cost $2500 to hear Prof Ian Angell talk
last year at Black Hat in Las Vegas. This also includes a nice buffet lunch
and free beer (hopefully)  at the conclusion of the event in the TCD
Pavilion bar.
http://www.tcd.ie/Clubs/Pavilion/


RSnake, who talked at NITES in Feb  mentioned to me that he believes App Sec
in Ireland is very immature, funny that given we are aiming/believe to be a
"Knowledge Economy"?

The aim of the conference is to create awareness of the issues facing
software insecurity and poor application development practices.

I would ask you all on this list to encourage not only info sec individuals
to go to this event but also software developers and people involved in the
procurement and outsourcing of bespoke software applications.

Eoin

Hi Eoin,

The Black Hat comparison is exactly what I looked at, ?1500 for the 
ticket alone and then add on travel and accommodation to Las Vegas. Eoin 
has done an excellent job of getting a hugely talented set of speakers 
together, the likes of which I doubt has been seen in Ireland before.

If any members of this list have websites, blogs etc then please 
consider giving the conference a plug. I know myself 
(http://securityninja.co.uk/blog/?p=288) and David Lowry 
(http://www.webpayments.ie/blog/OWASP-Ireland-AppSec-2009-Conference.html) 
have done this already and I hope others will do the same.

As Eoin said recently "Ask not, what my chapter can do for me, but, what 
can I do for my chapter" and this is a time where you can do something 
for our chapter and at the same time increase your application security 
knowledge!

Dave

Thanks to all who replied off-list. A summary of replies for the list archives:

* M?irt?n O' Sullivan of Espion periodically presents a 1-day course
http://www.espion.ie/security-training/course/web-applications-security/

* Ernst & Young also provide AppSec training, written by Eoin Keary

* Deloitte provide hands on Web Application Security training. Contact
Leonard McAuliffe

* SANS also have a course on web app hacking and on secure software development
http://www.sans.org/training/description.php?mid=942
http://www.sans.org/training/description.php?mid=1027

In addition to scheduled public courses, many of the vendors were
prepared to do custom group training at their site or on our premises.

As regards pricing, the pre-conference training day in September
appears to be good value at ?450.

Cheers,
Kieran

PS "OWASP on the Move" is for getting international speakers and not training.

Fairly shoddy work from McAfee on this one - validate your inputs and 
outputs people!

Message-ID: <e65424b50905060942l3bb9f384i22a81ec3c1016db4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Just a heads up:

I was viewing Zone-H this afternoon and noticed some Irish websites listed
with today's date.

There are 31 in total all hosted on a Hosting365 server.
Details at the following URL:
http://www.zone-h.org/archive/ip=82.195.131.233/page=1

The majority of sites have been fixed/restored. Only a few still have the
attackers page, others are showing a blank page.

No sure what attack vector was used but in some instances the same sites
were hit back in 2007 which is slightly worrying..

passive scanner and a few more beside (on the same app)

FYI

List,

Moth is a VMware image with a set of vulnerable Web Applications and
scripts, that you may use for:
   - Testing Web Application Security Scanners
   - Testing Static Code Analysis tools (SCA)
   - Giving an introductory course to Web Application Security

The motivation for creating this tool came after reading
"anantasec-report.pdf" which is included in the release file which you
are free to download. The main objective of this tool is to give the
community a ready to use testbed for web application security tools.
For almost every web application vulnerability in existance, there is
a test script available in moth.

Other tools like this are available but they lack one very important
feature: a list of vulnerabilities included in the Web Applications!
In our case, we used the results gathered in the anantasec report to
solve this issue without any extra work.

There are three different ways to access the web applications and
vulnerable scripts:
   - Directly
   - Through mod_security
   - Through PHP-IDS (only if the web application is written in PHP)

Both mod_security and PHP-IDS have their default configurations and
they show a log of the offending request when one is found. This is
very useful for testing web application scanners, and teaching
students how web application firewalls work. The beauty is that a user
may access the same vulnerable script using the three methods; which
helps a lot in the learning process.

This is the first contribution of Bonsai Information Security to the
w3af project. Many more contributions are on it's way,

More information about moth and the download link can be found here:

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Question about identity over two systems
Message-ID: <5b490250905120931n71b0afe0s5e2869188cd8de29@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I'm really not sure if this is an approriate list to ask implmentation
questions on, but trawling the archives the traffic has been varied, so I'll
chance my arm and if anyone can point me to a more appropriate list...

I'm looking for a technique that will allow an application A1 to create user
transactions in another application A2, _without sharing any identifying
information_.

Specifically:

1) Application A1 stores information for a set of user entities.  User u1 is
identitifed by i1

2) A1 wants to create a transaction in application A2 for application user
u1, but MUST NOT share any identifying information with A2 (due to data
protection act).  A2 cannot store any identifying information, likewise due
to DPA.

3) Application User u1 needs to identify and authenticate herself to A2 so
that she can query transactions that are hers

4) Support user u2 wants to query A2 and list transactions of u1.  The
support user will know i1 (or be able to request it from the user - but not
any secret information).

I have identified one solution using hashes:
- Calculate hash i1, and use that as an identifier in all transactions.
Call this H(i1).
- u1 can submit (i1, password) to the application A2. A2 calculates H(i1)
(but does not store i1) and that is used to query transactions. Password is
used to authenticate
- After having authenticated to A2 using (i2, supportPassword), u2 can
submit i1 to A2, H(i1) is calculated and used in query.

I _think_ this approach is sound, but would like confirmation from you guys!

One identified issue, is that the space of identifiers i1 is well known and
finite (10^7 combinations).  It could be possible to generate a lookup table
of all identifiers, and their corresponding hashes.  The only way I can see
a way around this, is by salting the hash with a PIN that is stored in A1,
communicated to the user via A1 and is part of the identifying information
used to calculate the hash.  But then, how do I provide support user access
to the records in A2  (as the support user cannot know the PIN)?

Here's hoping someone can point me in the right direction!

Pete

Thanks all,
I've had a few out-of-band replies and pretty much everyone is suggesting
identity federation schemes.

We want to provide added value to the customers of another company, and
their management/marketing team think we have a great idea.  But the problem
for us is that we wanted to provide the entire solution with minimum
disruption to the tech team/data centre of the other company.

We wanted to be masters of our own destiny and deliver the solution at our
pace without depending on the other team to deliver infrastructure.

It's very early days on this deal, and it could be that they already have
federation integration points in place for partners, but we have not had the
luxury of being able to actually speak to their tech team yet... We'll just
have to wait.

In retrospect, the hashing scheme I proposed in my inital mail is too weak:
it takes 3 mins to generate 10^8 hashes and we would need incredibly large
PINs to make it even remotely difficult to crack them.

Thanks for all your replies

Pete

PS Always add salt to your hashes!

Sorry I didn't reply sooner, I was away.

I found it to be very good Eoin, low false positives for me but I guess 
it is going to vary depending on the app complexity.

Hi Owasp Ireland

I am new to this list and would like to take a moment to introduce  
myself.



I was involved with Web2.0 application development since 1996. For  
last 4 years I am CTO of Agile Technologies Limited - software service  
company providing web 2.0 application development on top of open- 
source multi-purpose MVC framework - AModules3.

I was interested in security ever since I wrote my first login.exe for  
Novell 3.0 which would trick other students in our school to enter  
their network password. Later I found my niche in Web Software  
applications and platforms. My company is not extremely security- 
focused but still - application security have an important role in our  
every project.

I am joining this list by suggestion of Dave Lowry. Also greetings to  
David Rook.

Please feel free to contact me regarding anything web software-related  
- I will try to be as helpful as I can.


P.S. To find out more about me - read my article on Web Application  
Scalability: http://irishdev.com/Home/News/425-The-Feature-Friday--Master-Piece.html

The metasploit 3.0 vuln is a buffer overflow. The vuln detailed below is a
simple HTTP request.

Metasploit not needed just notepad and IE/Firefox :)

If anyone has public facing IIS  6.0 webDav (web distributed authoring and
versioning) it may be worthwhile monitoring this as there is no solution for
this issue currently!

Sorry, I was thinking of this: 
http://trac.metasploit.com/browser/framework3/trunk/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wmap_dir_webdav_unicode_bypass.rb?rev=6562

Thats just a scanner to see if you are vulnerable, might be useful for 
people to use anyway.

Now I can see where I got confused, that module is a scanner but if it 
comes across a system with authentication it uses the exploit that Eoin 
linked to - need to defrag my brain!
