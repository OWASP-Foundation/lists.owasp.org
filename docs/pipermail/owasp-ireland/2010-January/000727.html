*==Talk==

Title: ***OWASP O2 Platform - Open Platform for automating application
security knowledge and workflows

In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the OWASP O2 Platform which is an open
source toolkit specifically designed for developers and security consultants
to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough 'source-code-driven'
application security reviews. The OWASP O2 Platform (
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform</A>) consumes results from the
scanning engines from Ounce Labs, Microsoft's CAT.NET tool, FindBugs,
CodeCrawler and AppScan DE, and also provides limited support for Fortify
and OWASP WebScarab dumps. In the past, there has been a very healthy
skepticism on the usability of Source Code analysis engines to find commonly
found vulnerablities in real world applications. This presentation will show
that with some creative and powerful tools, it IS possible to use O2 to
discover those issues. This presentation will also show O2's advanced
support for Struts and Spring MVC.

*==Presenter==
*
Dinis Cruz is the Chief OWASP Evangelist and a Security Consultant based in
London (UK) and specialized in: ASP.NET Application Security, Active
Directory deployments, Application Security audits and .NET Security
Curriculum Development.
Since the 1.1 release of the .Net Framework, Dinis has been one of the
strongest proponents of the need to write .Net applications that can be
executed in secure Partially Trusted .Net environments, and has done
extensive research on: Rooting the CLR, exposing the dangers of Full Trust
Asp.Net Code, Type Confusion vulnerabilities in Full Trust (i.e. non
verifiable) code, creating .Net Security Protection Layers and using
Reflection to dynamically manipulate .Net Client applications.
Dinis is the current [Owasp .Net Project] and [OWASP Autumn of Code]
project's leader and the main developer of several of OWASP .Net tools
([SAM'SHE], [ANBS], [SiteGenerator], Owasp Report Generator, [Asp.Net
Reflector]).
Dinis is a active trainer on .Net security having written and delivered
courses for IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG . His latest
course is the two day training course [Advanced Asp.Net Exploits and
Countermeasures, which was delivered at the Black Hat 2006 conference and
will be presented on the fortcomming [OWASP AppSec Conference] in Seattle.


Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter
page ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland</A> ).
