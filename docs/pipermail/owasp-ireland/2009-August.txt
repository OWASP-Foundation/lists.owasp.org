Any security related media ho / douchebag could be a target and irish
people are not exempt (see zf03)

A good defensive strategy would be to not be a douchebag.. ;)

All very valid points (and best practices to follow). Kaminsky's sys  
admin skills are obviously lacking in some aspects or he was merely  
careless and probably arrogant.

Both himself and Mitnick are twats with the latter's role in the IT  
Security field being at the very least questionable IMHO. Whether or  
not any of us would be as targetted as those two is questionable, well  
maybe Eoin?

J Grossman came back to blackhat this year with more "get Rich or die
trying" aspects to fraud on the Internet, breaking business models and
scamming.
Very little technical knowledge required.

Hi Fabio,

We have the offer of a stand for OWASP but the requirement is that it is
manned 8 hours a day for the entire event.
I don't have the time to do this personally but feel free to talk to Barry
Alistair if you can fulfil this requirement. (I can send you his contact
details).
On another note I am speaking at the event (http://epicenter.ie/) on the
26th (Web Track) on behalf of OWASP and presenting the ASVS framework.

It would be great if someone could volunteer but it doesn't look like we 
can get people together. I will also be presenting once (possible twice, 
tbc) during the conference as well.

Hi everyone,

If anyone is interested you can grab the slides from my DEFCON (Security 
Risks of Web 2.0) and SecurityBSides (The Principles of Secure 
Development) presentations on my blog now.

DEFCON: http://securityninja.co.uk/blog/index.php/2009/08/02/my-defcon-talk/

SecurityBSides: 
http://securityninja.co.uk/blog/index.php/2009/07/31/vegas-day-1-securitybsides-and-defcon/

I will be presenting on similar topics at Epicenter Dublin

good then make sure you come along to see the full Security Ninja 
experience ;-)

It would be great if someone could volunteer but it doesn't look like we 
can get people together. I will also be presenting once (possible twice, 
tbc) during the conference as well.

Hi David, 
	I didn't realize you were presenting, I was there but missed your talk. Just wanted to mention that (my hero) Samy was at Defcon ;), not sure if got to meet him or if he was in the audience for your talk. He has spoken previously at our OWASP Los Angeles chapter meeting, very entertaining story.

I finally managed to get some time to peruse the slides, it looks like a
excellent presentation. I am looking forward to the video being posted so I
can see those ninja skills in action. Kudos for getting little bobby tables
in there, I always felt he deserved more of the limelight.

Hi,
Dave Lowry and myself were discussing the merits of having CISSP.
I believe it is useful from a credential perspective but does not imply
skill or aptitude for security in general.

May I ask who is CISSP and what do they think of its usefulness and
relevance?

BTW, every hour in attendance at the OWASP event on Sept 10th is worth one
CPE credit towards your CISSP or CISA.

Hi Eoin

I passed my CISSP exam last year. I agree with your points but would also
like to add some of my own.

As the CISSP covers such a broad range of areas under the information
security banner, I believe it provides professionals in this area with a
good baseline understanding of information security and everything that goes
with it. Most of us in our careers would not work in all of these areas but
I believe it is essential to have this basic understanding of them in order
to be able to see the bigger picture. On completing the exam my thoughts
were that we should all have this understanding as a starting point. Alone
it may not stand to much other than another credential but I believe it
provides support to any other specialisations or skills.

Looking forward to the conference!

Michelle

Hi Eoin,

 

I am a CISSP, certified in August 2007. 

 

It is interesting that you brought up such a subject at this point as I
frantically struggle to maintain my annual CPE's (I don't suppose you
fancy having 6 hours worth of chapter meetings in the next 7 days?) I am
beginning to rethink the merits of actually maintaining the
certification.

 

At this stage 80% of my CPEs are from podcasts. So for my AMF's what
does ISC2 do for me? 

 

According to its official website:

"In a world full of security threats, the need for skilled,
knowledgeable information security professionals has never been
greater..... Certification by a respected accreditation organization is
becoming indispensable to the information security professional. .....
credentialed practitioners have a higher earning potential, as well as
greatly expanded career opportunities. "

Is there a market for CISSPs? A quick search for the key word in Irish
Jobs returns 5 hits. The same search for 'Business Analyst' returns 5949
hits.

 

Late last year while job hunting the only 'CISSP desirable but not
essential' role I was offered was as a glorified DBA with a not very
glorified salary.

 

So the cycle continues, I take the Project Management and Business
Analyst roles moving further and further away from gaining the 'Industry
Experience' required for a CISSP aligned Security role, and practice IT
Security in my 'spare time' to retain my certification.

 

Any arguments in favour of the CISSP as a career advancing certification
would be greatly welcome!

 

Regards,

Mary

Hi Guys,

As a CISSP for over 4  years now I agree with some of the points.
It is an established a baseline (a low baseline) of knowledge about security in general but gives someone a broad view of what is required. Also the fact that you need experience before you are eligible is good.
In my opinion it is more a door opener and brings with it a level of credibility when I am meeting clients. It does not mean that I am an expert but I understand enough to know when to call in the experts, which is very important.
Regarding keeping it up to date, I agree with Mary, you don't really get value for money for the AMF and the CPEs can very easily be created and I have never heard of anybody being audited yet.
As regards advancing a career, it certainly helped me, but my background has always been network security so it was a logical step. I think in places like the US and possibly the UK the CISSP has more weight and is held in higher regard by employers, but as with anything, if you hire based on a qualification only you are heading for trouble.
Think of it like PCI, it is a low baseline, it will do no harm but it is by no means the be all and end all of security. At the end of the day it is really a memory test but at the moment I think that it is the best we have.

That's my 2c.

Cheers,

Gary

Hi,

 

First of all I am not CISSP certified.

 

In my opinion CISSP is a two-edged sword. On one hand it is a great
opportunity to learn about a broad range of security topics while preparing
for the exam. However, on the other hand I consider CISSP (and other
certifications for that matter) as a large money making business for the
organization handing out the certifications. I also question the strategy of
ISC2 to advertise CISSP certification as a means to get USD 85'000 p.a.
salary (please do not quote me on that number). If earning more money for
all involved parties is THE selling point, I do not see how this should
result in well skilled workforce. I also think that CISSP alone does not
tell if somebody is really skilled or not and it cannot be a replacement for
a job interview and a critical appraisal of the applicant's industry
practice and references. A point which also worries me is the increasing
practice by some employers which use CISSP certified employees as a CYA
strategy.

 

Myself, I considered doing certifications but after having a closer look I
thought it is too expensive for what you get. That is the main reason why I
decided to pursue the M.Sc. degree at DCU. Although the range of topics is
probably not as broad as in CISSP and the course is very technical, you have
at least the chance to get your hands very dirty on a technical level.
Additionally, a M.Sc. degree does not expire.

 

These are my two cents.

 

Best regards,

Jan

Hi Jan,

I think, while it is certaily true that your M.Sc. won't expire in the same
way that a CISSP will, you still need to work at it after you graduate to
keep your knowledge relevant. This is what the CPE's try to force you to do,
although how effective they are is up for debate.

That said, you're not going to have to pay DCU $85 every year to be able say
that you have the degree.

Brian

Message-ID: <1e3c65040908251223q3ffd2cc9u841f97fff25ff350@mail.gmail.com>

As a former member of (ISC)2 Board of Directors, and active volunteer,
you'll not be surprised to find that I have stong opinions on the topic.
You might be surprised though, to find that they're not too far from all of
the points raised so far.

First point: There are three types of certification available in the market
at the moment:
1. Technical certification - SANS, Vendor related (Microsoft, Cisco,
Symantec, etc), EC Technical Hacker, etc
2. Generic certifications - ISC2, ISACA
3. Academic certifications - MSc, Dip in Forensics, etc.
Each of these have their merits & demerits, but I think that we have to look
at the area of certification (and what it offers each of us) holistically
rather than focusing on one particular cert.
Which one of these types is best?  To use the great SOx answer - "It
depends"
It depends greatly on what your chosen/planned career path is, the security
of your job, your expectations for the future.....

I'd argue that any certification doesn't prove competence in any manner. It
only goes to show that an individual has been successful in achieving a
certain score at a point in time.

Nevertheless, in so many cases, recruiting employers will list a
specific certification (or range of certs) to set a baseline and discourage
what they consider to be the timewasters (those going for the job despite
having no experience). In most cases, for security management roles, CISSP
or CISA (CISM is the more appropriate ISACA cert but simply isn't as well
known) are used as that baseline. That's just the way it is - (ISC)2 has
been around over 20 years with a membership of about 60k and ISACA even
longer. The reason that these specific baselines are used, is only because
there's nothing better on offer that's as well known in the marketplace.

Now - let me come back to an important point in the last paragraph. You'll
notice that I mentioned "for security *management* roles". The baseline
certs being looked for should be much different if the organisation is
recruiting a DBA, Firewall admin, RACF support.... but unfortunately
they nearly always use one-size-fits-all (primarily because they don't
really understand what "security do").
I was speaking with a chap last week who's a graduate of the MSs programme
in Information Security from Royal Holloway. The job he was interviewing for
was to independently review and report on a PKI implementation. Despite
having implemented and managed a large PKI environment in the past, and
having the MSc, the employer rejected his tender because he didn't meet
their certification criteria (i.e. didn't currently hold CISSP or CISA).

Bottom line:
If you're looking to set your career as a security techie - go for, and
maintain technical certifications
If you're looking to set your career in security management - get at least
one of the generic certifications and maintain it
If you want to educate yourself - go off and get an academic certification
If you're never going to have to interview again (internally or externally)
- save your money and let your certifications lapse

Them's the options!  Take your pick.
On a personal note - I'm happy to pass back any constructive suggestions
from the group to their exec management as to what (ISC)2 should be doing to
make their offering more valuable to their members. Please don't just tell
me that they don't offer enough content, opportunity, support...
Rather, outline exactly what you think that they're currently missing e.g.
local chapters, free seminars, technical guidelines, areas of the CBK that
should be covered, new certs, ......

Regards,

Richard Nealon
CISSP, CISM, CISA (and a bunch of others that I rarely if ever use, other
than to flesh out the CV)

PS - I'll respond separately on the CPE issue and the value for money issue
(no point in putting the whole mailing list to sleep in the one go)

CPEs per symposia, by about 10 instances from each organisation per year).
Past that - every hour that you receive a vendor presentation or demo; every
exam question that you write and submit; every time you read the newsletter
and answer the Quiz; every hour that you volunteer your services on a
committee or board; ....
There are so many ways to earn CPEs free of charge, that only require the
time and effort from each of us.
First port of call for quick & easy (and free) CPEs
https://www.isc2.org/e-symposium/default.aspx

AMFs - so what do we get for our $65?  We get free seminars, we get
reductions on a huge amount of vendor training, we get free e-symosia
monthly, we get a quarterly newsletter, we get deliverables (e.g. recent
awareness material submitted by members),  discounts off the academic
journal, online fora, and a host of other "stuff".   Have a look at
https://www.isc2.org/member-benefits.aspx
Most of all, we get the advantage of putting CISSP after our name. This
identifies us as professionals (this is what we do for a living), as
distinct from amateurs. It doesn't necessarily make us good professionals  -
as MD doesn't necessarily guarantee good doctors, but would you want an
amateur treating you for a medical complaint?

In terms of competing certification bodies, some organisations certainly do
provide more content than (ISC)2 - but they also charge significantly higher
AMFs!
Pertinent question being: What offers best value for money?

Richard

One important clarification on last evenings post that I forgot to make -
in relation to the point about professionalism:
There are a couple of dozen folk throughout the world who are recognised
immediately as consummate professionals by their given name. I place these
in a very special category that have no need of letters. In fact, those that
hold certifications and use the designation in their working lives, honour
the certification bodies by doing so.
Regards,
Richard

CPEs first - Many of my CPEs are maintained by attending the monthly
e-symposia from (ISC)2 and ISACA.  I normally access them via the
archive after a couple of months and get them done in one large traunch.
Between the two, I can claim about 60 CPE hours a year if I'm bothered (3
CPEs per symposia, by about 10 instances from each organisation per year).

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] US Bill to Declare a cybersecurity emergency
Message-ID: <f3193c100908290510s6abbd6edmf35ccd6aa1dae43@mail.gmail.com>

http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10320096-38.html

The new version would allow the president to "declare a cybersecurity
emergency" relating to "non-governmental" computer networks and do what's
necessary to respond to the threat. Other sections of the proposal include a
federal certification program for "cybersecurity professionals," and a
requirement that certain computer systems and networks in the private sector
be managed by people who have been awarded that license
