Hi,
Due to reasons beyond our control we can not use FISC-Ireland offices to
host meetings.
If anyone can suggest a place (with a projector), maybe one of your own
offices??? please give me a shout. Or drop me an email?
If any company would like to be associated with OWASP this would be a good
opportunity seen as the Top Ten is becoming an industry standard.


Best regards,

Eoin
