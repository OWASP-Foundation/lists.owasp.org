Subject: [Owasp-ireland] OWASP AppSec Ireland 2012 - Challenge :-)
Message-ID: <87D3FE1E-A4EE-4913-95CD-866DEC586192@owasp.org>

The OWASP AppSec Ireland Conference will be held at Trinity College Dublin from September 4th through 6th 2012. There will be training courses on September 4th and 5th followed by plenary sessions on the 6th. 

This conference, in its 4th consecutive year, is a premier gathering for Information Security leaders, executives from Fortune 500 firms along with technical thought leaders, security architects and lead developers. 

This year we have the pleasure to count with the presence of Jeremiah Grossman (CTO, Whitehat Security), Reeny Sondhi (Director, Product Security at EMC Corp), Rafal Los (Chief Security Evangelist, HP) among so many other distinguished professionals.

More information about the event here: www.appsecireland.org

Just to add a little fun to it, here is a small challenge that will avail a 20% discount towards the conference registration fees to the first 3 individuals who solve it.

"A french man who likes to be cryptic lost a piece of paper with the following message written on it VXVWRGZV. When I asked around where I could find him, the only response I got was he is heading to APPSECIRELAND2012"

Those who figure out the "special word" could use it during registration to the conference: http://reg.appsecireland.org

Best of luck and see you soon.

Fabio

hi there,

Just wanted to highlight a few things that you will surely find interesting:

*Free Application Security Workshop at Realex Payments*

David Rook and Dave Stubley are going to deliver a free workshop that will
delve into the basics of application security. The workshop runs from 4pm
to 6.30pm and will be followed by the Web Awards launch, which takes place
in our offices on Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2 on August 23rd. Both
are highly skilled professionals with plenty of experience so surely is one
not to miss... more info here:
http://www.securityninja.co.uk/application-security/free-application-security-workshop-at-realex-payments/

*iOS Keychain Weakness FAQ*

I've recently came across this paper from the Fraunhofer Institute for
Secure Information Technology that discusses the keychain weaknesses in
Apple iOS devices. As you probably know, the keychain is intended as secure
storage for sensitive user data that should be protected even if an
attacker has physical access to the device. Therefore, the keychain stores
secrets for services used by the operating system (e.g., WiFi passwords,
VPN credentials, etc.) but also credentials stored by 3rd party apps.

Full paper here:
http://sit.sit.fraunhofer.de/studies/en/sc-iphone-passwords-faq.pdf

*OWASP AppSec Ireland 2012*

With less than a month away, we are approaching the biggest application
security conference at a thrilling speed!

I would suggest you to get your ticket for either the conference, training
or both :-) as soon as possible.

You could find fees information here:
http://www.cvent.com/events/owasp-appsec-ireland-2012/fees-70c5ca0f58574d2380041feca6abfb07.aspx

The full agenda and training details could be found here:
www.appsecireland.org

Also, remember there is going to be a Secure Coding Competition to give you
and your friends the chance to test your secure coding skills and challenge
other secure coders for the title of AppSec Ireland 2012 Secure Coding
Competition (SCC) Champions. The competition is open to everybody and is
designed to promote awareness of the benefits of designing and developing
secure applications ? a skill that all aspiring and accomplished software
developers should aim to possess.

Any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,

Fabio Cerullo

Thanks for posting our workshop to the list Fabio.

I just wanted to let you know all the places have been taken now but 
because of the amount of interest we will be running another free 
application security workshop next month. I'll let you know the 
specifics when we have them but it's likely to be week commencing 17th 
September.

Hi Eoin,

We had a chat about that and we won't be able to have that in place by 
next week but we plan to do it for the one we are running in September.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] OWASP AppSec Ireland 2012 Challenge - Win a free
	ticket!
Message-ID: <CAE69ks5dJKy_g__B8mUOTevaEdLfY-EzME-tLRD358eUOsQ8iQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi there,

The OWASP Vicnum Project is an open source project that helps you test
your knowledge on web application security. The AppSec Ireland 2012
challenge is to see if you can 'union' the two Vicnum games, Guessnum
and Jotto, using the same browser as I have used.

Players that solve the challenge should contact ireland at owasp.org

The competition will run until Friday 31st August.

Once the competition is over, the first three winners will get a FREE
ticket to the conference.

http://vicnum.ciphertechs.com/appsec2012.html

Please be aware the use of ?scripts?, ?brute force? or any other
automated or programmed means, will inmediately void any prize award
and the participant will be refused further participation.

A big thanks goes to Mordecai and the Ciphertechs team for setting up
this challenge.

Best of luck everyone!

Regards,

Fabio

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] An evening with Jerry Hoff - next Tuesday 4th @
	5:30PM
Message-ID: <CAE69ks4O0B+i_QRuqRY1Se78u92fcnYur3i22JVdNyiafhbv3w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

As part of the OWASP Appsec Ireland conference we are going to host a free
event next Tuesday 4th September 2012.

Our special guest this time is Jerry Hoff, VP of Static Code Analysis
Division at WhiteHat Security, who will talk about AppSec Training,
Securing the SDLC, WebGoat.NET and the Meaning of Life.
*
*
REGISTRATION: http://reg.appsecireland.org (select "AppSec Training,
Securing the SDLC, WebGoat.NET and the Meaning of Life")
*
*
*DATE: *Tuesday 4th September
*TIME:* 17:30-19:00
*LOCATION:*
Google Ireland Engineering
1 Upper Grand Canal Street
Placemark on this map : http://goo.gl/ZGASA
Dublin, Co Dublin 4
Ireland
*
*
*ABSTRACT: *
One of the most vital pieces of a secure SDLC is security training ? not
only for developers, but for Architects, QA and anyone else involved in the
creation of software. Too frequently, this is minimized, overlooked or
completely absent within an organization. In some cases, the very idea of
application security is dismissed as unnecessary. This talk starts by
making a strong argument for developer education, and how it fits into any
organization?s SDLC. Training will be put into the context of NIST?s
?Security considerations in System Development Life Cycle? Document,
Microsoft?s Simplified SDL, BSIMM3 and OWASP Open SAMM.

*BIO:*
Lecture will be delivered by Jerry Hoff, VP of Static Code Analysis
Division at WhiteHat Security. Jerry is the leader of the OWASP Appsec
Tutorial Series, WebGoat.NET and AntiSamy.NET. Jerry is a former developer,
author, and has over 10,000 hours delivering technical training. Jerry
holds a Masters degree in Computer Science from Washington University in
St. Louis.
