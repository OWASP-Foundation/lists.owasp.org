Anyone interested in this M.Sc. can find out more at the UCD Open Evening on Wednesday 4 April, when there will be a special info session on this programme at 530pm. Dr Pavel Gladyshev from UCD will talk to  the group about UCD's M.Sc. programmes in this field which include the M.Sc. in Digital Investigation and Forensic Computing for computer science graduates and IT professionals in security or digital forensics roles (available part-time by distance learning or full-time in UCD) and the M.Sc. in Forensic Computing & Cybercrime Investigation (part-time distance learning programme for law enforcement).

Hi all,

our meetup in April will be on Monday the 30th at 6:30pm in Workday.

In this meeting, Loic Rivron will go through the lessons learned while securing AWS Accounts for Workday. Also, as new breaches strike large and well established companies, we will go through the lessons learned by Eoin Hinchy who has experienced some of such incidents from a leadership perspective.

Please RSVP at https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/owasp-dublin-security-lessons-learned-on-leadership-aws-accounts-tickets-44916382108 and feel free to share it within your network.


All the best,
Myriam

Sorry to those receiving this twice.


I'm sure there will be plenty of people on this list that will hopefully be interested in this event.


[cid:a44d6277-d79e-4d77-aaa6-cec64884614d]
At this year's Zero Days CTF we hope to have 70+ teams on site making this one of the largest on-site CTF events in the world.

We're encouraging everyone who is interested to check out our website (www.zerodays.ie<http://www.zerodays.ie>).


So if you want to give it try and enter a team, get involved as a sponsor or simply just turn up on the day to see what it's all about then please give us a shout at info at zerodays.ie


For those unfamiliar with with CTF events, Capture the Flag (CTF) events allow teams of 4 to complete against each other as they try to solve a number of security related challenges.

Challenges cover domains such as web application testing, server exploitation, cryptography, reversing engineering, programming, password cracking, reconnaissance, trivia and whatever else we throw into the mix.

The team solving the most challenges is announced as the winner.  The event is focused on student teams but we also have over 20 industry/professional teams all using the event as training, fun and team building.


A huge thanks to all the sponsors we've already confirmed for this years event.

We have another great event scheduled for Thursday 10th May, so save the date too. Colm Stapleton from the National Cyber Security Centre will talk about their services including threat intelligence sharing and incident response. Fergus Cooney from Tenable will talk about DNS & Web App Security, how it can be (ab)used by both blue and red security teams. More info coming shortly.


But see you on Monday first!
  
Thanks,

OWASP Dublin team
