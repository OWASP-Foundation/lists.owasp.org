Their mission is to create an environment where people are introduced to the
world of hacking in all its different aspects, or where experienced
professionals can improve their current skill set.

So, bring your laptop, team up with some of your colleagues and try to break
their challenges which are broad and meant to be fun for everyone.  Even if
you are new to penetration testing give it a go, it's fun fun fun!!
