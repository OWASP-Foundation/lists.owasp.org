<PRE>Hi all,

As you may be aware our Dublin chapter meetings are driven by the
contributions of those within our community. To this end I would like any
of you (or if you know anyone) who may be interested in speaking at one of
our chapter meetings to get in contact with me or any of the other board
members (Eoin, Fabio and Mark).

We are interested in speakers from all aspects of security, for example, we
have recently had speakers on the following topics;


   1.     PCI DSS
   2.     Social Engineering - The Art of Human Hacking
   3.     Top 10 defensive Java developer controls
   4.     Top 10 Web Hacks of 2013
   5.     Building a shield of security - Vulnerability Management by the
   numbers and dumb robots!


Next month we hope to run a day workshop (Saturday) on Mobile Security with
3 speakers and then a Capture the Flag run using our very own OWASP project
Security Shepherd  ( Mark Denihan and Sean Duggan). For this event we
require 1 further speaker.

If you would like to speak and may not be available in the coming months we
would still like to hear from you as you may be free for one of our other
events.

Our chapter events are generally held on Thursday evenings from 6:30 to
9:00pm  at our new location Morgan McKinley's offices, 1 Burlington road
with two one hour speaker slots. Morgan McKinley kindly provide BEER and
PIZZA for attendees.

It's also possible to become a chapter sponsor. This means that you get
your organisation mentioned in meeting promotion, recognition at the
beginning of the meeting and promotional material at the meeting.

We currently have the following sponsorship options available:


   1.     &#8364;250 for an individual meeting sponsorship
   2.     &#8364;1500 for annual chapter sponsorship


For more information please contact one of the board members.
