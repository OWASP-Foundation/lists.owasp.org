Talk details

Leveling up a global application security awareness program

The talk will focus on Riot application security awareness and knowledge
sharing in a global company. I will talk about the application security
awareness efforts we've implemented this year to bring application security
knowledge to software engineers worldwide. These awareness efforts were
designed to educate and support engineers around the world who work on high
profile web properties and one of the worlds most popular computer games.

I will explain how we've used a combination of traditional and innovative
approaches to levelling up our software engineers security knowledge.

Owner of the Security Engineering vertical. Currently he's focused on
building a team, engineering cool solutions, levelling the security
program, finding the cloud, dealing with DDOS, and trying to earn Silver
