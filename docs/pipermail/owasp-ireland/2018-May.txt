*## Coder Dojo Coolest Projects - Volunteers Needed*

Coder Dojo Coolest Projects is taking place in the RDS on Saturday 26th 
May, and OWASP Dublin will be hosting a stand to talk about security. 
Coder Dojo started in Ireland and is now a worldwide initiative that 
inspires, showcases, and promotes the creativity, innovative thinking, 
technological skills, and entrepreneurship of young coders aged 7?17. 
_We need your help to get set up for this event and to talk to some of 
the 15,000 attendees on the day. If you can help, please drop an email 
to brendan.gormley at owasp.org or denise.murtaghdunne at owasp.org._ You 
don't have to commit to the whole day, and any assistance is welcome.

In particular we would like to hear from you if you can assist graphic 
design for the stand and awareness material for visitors. We plan to 
have to interactive demos to talk about online safety and a technical 
demonstration of how security can be compromised.

*## April Event - Thanks*

A big thanks to everyone who joined us for the April event this week. We 
hope you enjoyed the talks, and would love to get your feedback 
<https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NG8LKRV>. Special thanks to the speakers 
Eoin and Loic for their great talks, and to Workday for hosting and 
providing pizza and beer.

Thanks,

Brendan and the OWASP Dublin team

finalising the arrangements and will have more details shortly.

*# Recent Meetings*
We've had some very successful meetings recently and we wanted to say
thanks to all the speakers, sponsors, and everyone who helped to make these
a success. We're only able to do this with a lot of voluntary involvement
so we appreciate your help. So a shout out to:

*# Coder Dojo Coolest Projects*
Last Saturday a group from the Dublin chapter attended the Coder Dojo
Coolest Projects event in the RDS. We had a stand where we spoke about
security, with some tips on how kids can stay safe online, and a
demonstration of wifi hacking. We had a really great day, with lots of
interesting conversation, some inspiring kids and a good chance to get the
OWASP message to a wider audience. It's quite an effort to pull everything
together for these public events, so thanks to all who put in so much time
and effort:
- Alain Abou Tass, Abhishek Borkar, Abhishek Bhate, Claudio Marcial Peon,
Lei Shao, Martin Mitchell.
- A special thanks to Denise Murtagh-Dunne for her tireless work behind the
scenes, and to Angela for the impressive illustrations and selfie frame
that brought an extra spark to the stand.

See you soon,

Brendan and the OWASP Dublin team
