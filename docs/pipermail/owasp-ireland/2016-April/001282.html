<PRE>Hi Everyone,

Many thanks to all who came and participated at the Dublin Chapter meeting
yesterday, we hope you found it interesting. Thanks again to all the
speakers and sponsors particularly, Morgan McKinley, E&amp;Y, BCC Risk
Advisory/Edgescan, PwC, IBM Security team &amp; Ward Solutions. We very much
appreciate the support and your involvement in the OWASP community.

We had about 80 people at the meeting and below is a summary for anyone who
couldn't attend.

*Session 1*
Hugh Jones from Sytorus &lt;<A HREF="http://www.sytorus.com/">http://www.sytorus.com/</A>&gt; gave a very insightful
presentation on &#8220;Data Protection Officer&#8217;s - Overview of the GDPR&#8221;. Which
included the new principles and the implications for Data Controllers and
Data Processors.

The presentation can be found here:

*Session 2*
This session took a panel format and included the following experts:

   - Hugh Callaghan - Director of Financial Services Advisory at EY
   &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ey.com/IE/en/Services/Advisory/Risk/Information-Security">http://www.ey.com/IE/en/Services/Advisory/Risk/Information-Security</A>&gt;;
   - Rahim Jina - Director at BCC Risk Advisory
   &lt;<A HREF="http://www.bccriskadvisory.com/">http://www.bccriskadvisory.com/</A>&gt;;
   - Dara Boland  - Principal Consultant at Morgan McKinley
   &lt;<A HREF="http://www.morganmckinley.ie/">http://www.morganmckinley.ie/</A>&gt;;
   - Jason Flood  - CTO at IBM &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/ie-en/">http://www.ibm.com/ie-en/</A>&gt;;
   - Leonard McAuliffe - Director of Cyber Security and Forensics at PwC
   &lt;<A HREF="http://www.pwc.ie/services/consulting/information-security-cybercrime.html">http://www.pwc.ie/services/consulting/information-security-cybercrime.html</A>&gt;;
   and
   - Declan Timmons - Principal Security Consultant at Ward Solutions
   &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ward.ie/">http://www.ward.ie/</A>&gt;.

The panel gave their insights on working in the IT &amp; Information Security
and took questions from the audience which sparked some interesting debate.
Some of the discussion points included:

   - The security market as a whole and how the supply of IT security
   candidates is not currently meeting the demand;
   - How to move into IT security, where the panel outlined they are
   looking for smart, enthusiastic and proactive individuals. There was advice
   from the panel to demonstrate enthusiasm by contributing to the security
   community and projects and gaining skills in your own time.  Other advice
   included proactively contacting security leaders in organisations you wish
   to work with via social media instead of waiting for roles to be advertised;
   - The panel discussed how job specs are developed internally and that
   not everything is always mandatory and encouraged people to apply for roles
   even if they don&#8217;t meet all the criteria;
   - The panel discussed how having practical industry experience is of
   benefit when providing realistic recommendations to clients as opposed
   having a pure text book view of security;
   - We spoke about certifications and how they can be utilised in the
   absence of experience to get a &#8216;foot in the door&#8217; and to tailor your
   certifications to the area of security you wish to work in;
   - Advice for individuals looking to move into IT security from other
   roles, which included the recommendation that they should use their
   existing skills as a selling point;
   - The audience and panel agreed that there was a need for more females
   to become involved in IT security so that security teams are more diverse
   and provide different perspectives in terms of problem solving and
   innovation. There was good advice from the audience and panel around
   removing barriers to applying for roles, it was suggested that language
   such as &#8220;desirable&#8221; and &#8220;preferred but not required&#8221; should be considered
   in job specs;
   - The panel spoke about the role educational institutions play in the
   security market and there was general consensus that an imbalance currently
   existed between security and forensics elements in most higher level
   courses and that forensics should play a smaller role in courses;
   - Advice for graduates applying for roles was to ensure that they could
   speak at length on their project and use this as a differentiator when
   interviewing.
   - The was also advice for individuals moving from other disciplines and
   it was suggested that they play to their strengths and use their existing
   skill sets when applying for roles and also in education when selecting a
   project and to utilise their experience from another disciple coupled with
   a security slant;

Pizza, beer and refreshments were provided by our generous hosts Morgan
McKinley.

We&#8217;d encourage everyone to continue the debate or ask questions on the
OWASP list and let us know what you thought of the sessions.

Feel free to respond to the open call for board members and volunteers and
thanks to everyone who has expressed an interest so far.

Many Thanks,

Tony.
