We're hoping to have some gifts to give away as part of the night.

*Session 1 - John Turner - Monkey Little*

John Turner has been developing software in the financial and betting
industry since 1999. He has a huge interest in the changing ways in which
software projects are being delivered. This has led John to discover, learn
and apply the practices and principles fundamental to Agile software
development particularly those of Scrum and Lean. More recently John spends
his time identifying how best to leverage the emergence of Cloud (IAAS,
PAAS, SAAS) to create more Agile businesses.

John's session will focus on &quot;DevOps Adoption Patterns&quot;. While DevOps is
still riding high on a peak of inflated expectations, a number of patterns
of adoption are starting to emerge. The conceptual definition of Agile made
it difficult to embrace until frameworks such as Scrum became popular. In
this same way, the theoretical and visionary definition of DevOps is
creating a barrier to entry for those eager to realise its benefits. Fear
not, for there are brave soles who have gone before us that we can strive
to emulate!  Join us to talk about some of the ways in which people are
'doing DevOps&#8217;.

*Session 2 - Noel King - VSWare *

Noel is VP for Engineering at VSWare an Irish Software company which
provides a cloud based administration system to the education sector.  He
has led and developed software solutions across multiple sectors and is
focused on driving excellence through team orientated development utilising
the best industry standards. He has a passion for quality assurance,
development automation, continuous delivery and leveraging cloud to get
your product to market quicker.

He spends his free time volunteering with CoderDojo, mentoring the
technology innovators of the future, building cool and fun course material
and promoting the ideology.  Passionate about education and inspiring the
next generation he created CoderDojo Coolest Projects Awards.  The Coolest
Projects is now Ireland's largest tech event that focuses on creativity
takes place annually in Dublin and Silicon Valley.

Noel's session is entitled &quot;Banishing Snakes from Green Field Development&quot;.

*Session 3 - Ryan Sudding - VMware*

Ryan works for VMware as a Systems Engineer. He has spent the last number
of years working as an Infrastructure Consultant, but more recently has
spent more time working with the VMware Network and Security Business Unit.
He loves cars, travel and spending time with his wife and 11 month old
daughter.

Ryan's session will be primarily focused on the current security landscape
and also will also try debunk a few security myths.


Looking forward to seeing you there.

Thanks,

Tony.
