<PRE>Hi Everyone,

We're happy to announce that we will be hosting the next OWASP Dublin
chapter event in the Morgan McKinley&#8217;s office on Thursday May 26th 2016 at
6:30pm.

The cybersecurity industry has significant shortage of skilled
professionals regionally, nationally and internationally. Research has
shown that women&#8217;s representation in cybersecurity has been low and is on
decline. This OWASP Dublin chapter meeting aims to discuss many of the
challenges around attracting and retaining women in the cybersecurity
industry. We're very exited to have the guests below who will speak on the
topic and give their insights.

Please feel free to forward the event to friends and colleagues.
