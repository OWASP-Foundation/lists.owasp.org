Guys,



Any ideas of a *good* topic for a panel discussion which may engage the
initiated and non alike?



Something controversial? or bi partisan?  ("The world is flat" or "yes earth
is in the middle of the universe") in order to make for an interesting
discussion?



Whoever comes up with the best one I'll buy them as much Guinness as they
can stomach (Tom Brennan not included).

HTML5 could have been a unifying standard which may have halted the
continued fracturing of the web as a platform, alas with the failure of the
browser vendors to unify behind this standard (dropping the video tag due to
lack of agreement on the codec) this will be the biggest missed opportunity
of the decade. ALL of the developments that are good about the internet/web
have come from a base of widely adopted and largely consistent
implementation of the standards. The failure to bring the HTML standard into
the shiny new world of the web application is the start of the end for web
applications. Building web applications is hard because HTML/Javacript is
definitely not a good foundation for an application platform. The reason it
continues to increase in popularity is because HTML/Javascript while far
from perfect is well implemented (despite Microsofts best efforts) and
standardised even across OS/Browser combinations. Now we have AIR,
Silverlight, Flash, Quicktime, Shockwave blah blah blah. All proprietary,
all different, all crap.
The web is dead. Dead? Yeah dead. US multinationals have screwed the pooch
again. Can industry and in particular the US software behemoths actually
ever create an innovative diverse and standardised eco-system for
technology? Can they ever understand that actually starting to compete with
each other on innovation rather than the red eyed craze of trying to
dominate an industry through proprietary lockin will benefit everyone? Or is
this the sole preserve of the academic community? I thought a quote from a
Microsoft employee made to me in 2003 summed it all up when speaking about
web services 'If only everyone had used DCOM, none of this would have been
neccessary.' Sigh!

For controversy dial C for Conor! :)

I have one as well: "The path to secure software does not start with 
specific vulnerabilities".

I think anyone on the Irish mailing list will know I have been saying 
since the release of the Sans Top 25 list earlier this year that I don't 
think lists of vulnerabilities is the optimal approach to developer 
education and ultimately secure software. We as software security 
professionals are guilty of telling to developers to prevent a list of 
vulnerabilities instead of telling to develop securely, yes I do feel 
there is a difference here. Think of it this way, when you are learning 
to drive does the instructor give you a list of ways to crash a car and 
hope you figure out how to avoid all of those different ways of crashing 
or does he teach you how to drive safely and within the rules of the road?

Everyone without fail in the application security community is guilty of 
doing this yet we blame the developers when the applications are 
insecure, are the security professionals not just as culpable for not 
educating developers correctly? Whether it be the OWASP top ten, PCI DSS 
Requirement 6.5 or companies offering secure development training they 
all focus on a small set of vulnerabilities instead of focusing on a set 
of secure development principles such as Input Validation, Error 
Handling and Secure Communications.

My phone line is always open :-) I agree with this line of thought and
perhaps can offer an extension which I see as gap in our current
understanding of why and where security vulnerabilities are coded into our
web applications. At present there is no specific Web Design and
Architecture methodology that has a maturity level commensurate with
traditional software development. Therefore I would suggest that most web
applications are not 'designed' in a manner that would allow security to be
addressed as a normal part of the process of creating the application. It is
this lack of maturity and  the failure to design web applications that is
the start of the end for security. No matter how many lists, vulnerabilities
or education developers receive, security issues will still be with us until
we start to engage in the area of design.

Hi Mostafa,

I wouldn't agree with what you have said, taking the example you have 
given there I fail to see why teaching someone to validate their inputs 
and outputs wouldn't be good in this case. If you had been teaching them 
set of secure development principles for a year (which would include 
input and output validation/encoding) and they still wrote that code 
then there is a bigger problem than just the potential of XSS ;-)

I don't think that education detailing specific vulnerabilities should 
be dropped but I think it shouldn't be a starting point either. A 
developers security education should not start at the intricate details 
of attacks such as XSS and SQL Injection rather this is somewhere their 
education should evolve to. Sure training courses wouldn't be a as 
"glamorous" and people would need to probably charge less for them but 
that's not the point here!

Thanks,

Dave

Eoin,

Good point on the NSE - there's a lot more functionality (& scripts)  
than in 4.76 but more importantly the engine seems a lot more stable  
and Nmap doesn't die wherewas previously I've seen instances where  
some scripts could cause it to die.

It worked really well on osx and windows but I ran into a few issues  
on Linux but resolved them fairly easily.

The NMAP lists are good resources -

http://seclists.org/rss/nmap-hackers.rss
http://seclists.org/rss/nmap-dev.rss

with loads of gurus on them.

Fyodor et al have done amazing work.

Now I just need to learn LUA.....

Cheers...mh

Irish dev tweeted a ref  to IE6 today.
My corporate laptop has IE 6 installed by default.....here are some reasons
why this is not such a good reason.
Shaping a site/application to a browser can only introduce additional
vulnerabilities or simple code quality issues.

A browser is a window to the Internet, we don't shape the world to fit the
window, do we?

Surely the argument is simple, give the man in the street a reason to 
upgrade and he will. If sites such as the BBC and Facebook stop working 
for IE6 users they will upgrade, we have had two IE releases, god knows 
how many Firefox releases, Safari to Windows and Google Chrome since the 
IE6 release date yet quite obviously none of them have made a 
significant (to the man in the street) difference to the  web browsing 
experience otherwise people would have an incentive to move.

If you want to innovate then innovate, if your innovation is good enough 
then people will upgrade their browser to use it, if they don't need to 
upgrade then they won't. Crying about it won't achieve anything ;-)

Hi

I am not sure about vulnerabilities but relying on latest trends  
surely breaks a lot of devices and older applications. Sure our  
grandparents can update browser, but there are many other devices  
(including mobiles) which can't be upgraded. Adopting new standards  
can take really long time (ipv6 anytime soon?), but web design/ 
development companies are so quick to jump on new standards.

What people often miss to explain is a difference between "supporting"  
old browsers and "having exactly same functionality" in older  
browsers. It is possible to develop a website or web application which  
would work in Netscape 4 and at the same time would use shadows,  
custom fonts and border styles introduced in CSS 3 (ie8, ff 3.5,  
safari 3.0).

Really good presentation by creators of jQuery UI:

http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/access_oriented_web_design_building_highly_interactive_web_apps_that_work_f/

I believe old browser users deserve a warning screen and then they  
should be able to access sites anyway.

We will probably hear more news about IE6 soon as it was sparked by  
YouTube's announcement to drop IE6 support:

http://news.google.com/news?um=1&ned=us&hl=en&q=youtube+ie6

Romans

Well that's my point, why should your Granny or my mother for that 
matter upgrade from IE6? I've yet to hear a compelling argument for this.

If we bought a potato peeler that required so many updates, tweeks etc we
would ask for our money back.  We cant touch, see, smell or feel much of the
issues with software today but they affect of lives nonetheless.



In the case of software we accept this as the norm; "expect patches"
(otherwise knows as "yes software is developed with low quality/security in
mind") or "everybody is doing this so it must be ok".



*We never fix our mistakes and we keep creating new ones*. -  Should be on
the tombstone for the software development industry.



The CVE list grows every year. IRISS is busier than ever and next year
busier methinks. Sure why do you think anyone involved in Secure SDLC,
Secure Code, App Sec is slammed with work?  The bad guys aren't only
stealing the cars, they are owning the roads as well.

I accept all of those points but still fail to see the argument for

and 3.5.1 both had vulnerabilities I believe) you will be vulnerable.

I look forward to discussing this Thursday :)

Why did you move to apple OSX or Windows XP so?
(Why do you change your sox?)
External factors change in the internet ecosystem things move on. In order
to assure interactivity between components of the internet things must
change to usit each other.

You can stick with IE6 but dont expect the world to stay there with you :0)

Hmmm, would there be time between this weeks meeting and the Trinity event?
I would be up for some debating/arguing/ranting etc :-) An interesting

fine (will peel spuds) but contains a design flaw that can kill you if
someone tricks you into trying to use it to peel a carrot .....

I didn't upgrade to XP, it came with the laptop. I didn't have a walkman 
either! If you take those two examples Dave they both (98 to XP and 
Walman to iPod) had very clear benefits to upgrading, I fail to see 
these clear benefits when it comes to the web browser.

I understand that technology evolves but I see no real evidence as to 
why a user should (must in some people's eyes) move away from IE6. If 
people cite security as a reason then I certainly won't buy that one, as 
I have mentioned several times all of the other browsers released since 
IE6 have had security issues and continue to do so until this day.

I'm happy to have my mind changed if anyone can provide a good answer to 
one question:

Why should someone upgrade from IE6?

No one has given a straight answer on that one yet :)

Tabbed browsing, TLS support and general anti-phising stuff are what I can
think of, not exactly compelling from a functional point of view. However
there would be a decent reason if HTML 5 is ever ratified/supported in
anything like its suggested at present. Web browsers render HTML and execute
client side scripts such as Javascript. HTML as a standard hasn't evovled
significantly in a decade. Therefore neither has browser
technology/innovation. Native support for radical things like video would be
nice, then I wouldn't have to install flash, realplayer or quicktime!

The HTML5 support would be the one reason I would definitely say its 
worth upgrading. IE6 supports XHR and Javascript so what more do you 
want ;-)

IE8 does bring some security features but there is a link on the OWASP 
home page linking to a blog from Michael Coates 
(http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/2009/07/webscarab-beanshell-to-disable-ie8-xss.html) 
on how to disable the filters in testing, how long until that (or 
similar) is used to exploit a user?

I agree completely - you cant site security as the reason for the move, its
*a* reason but not *the* reason - because there is no where for the end user
to move to that is 'secure'. Also you need to give the end user a carrot...
whats in it for them to take the step and do an upgrade? Do mainstream users
really understand security that's not a man in a hat, or a guy with a
clipboard outside a nightclub?

Lots of reports and reasons for users to move away from IE6 are because
supporting applications on a browser that tossed out standards and did
things its own way (especially in site design) has become cumbersome - and
then as almost an after thought( as is always the case with security) and an
attempt to carry more weight in the argument - say... "oh - and IE6 is full
of security holes."

(Its probably worth pointing out - its not the number of security holes, but
the risk thats the main thing - if IE6 had 1 million security holes that
allowed a hacker do very little - and Mozilla 3.X  had only 1 hole we dont
know about yet that allowed a hacker take full control of your PC thru VNC -
whats worse?)

For my money there is no reason to upgrade. The magpie/early adopter in me
wants to upgrade to what is shiny and new - but thats just me - not a reason
for the masses.

Recently I have come across websites that are controlled via css - that when
a user visits them they are told, your browser is not supported please
upgrade. That is all the user sees. If this idea catches on - then users
should upgrade - their hand is almost forced. But as long as mainstream
sites support IE6 - the benefits of upgrading from an end user
comprehensions perspective are negligible

Perhaps a better take on the question would be (iff IE6 is so insecure
relative to all other browsers)

*why do corporations put their clients at risk by not actively denying
access to their content by denying IE6 connections?*

Its no longer a chicken and egg argument,

Client: I'll upgrade IE6 when my browser no longer works.
Server: I'll support IE6 until no one is using it.

Actually - have we reached a state of politically correct Internet browser
deadlock? where no one is prepared to be the villain and say no!
:)

Dear Security Professional,

Please join us for Community SANS Dublin at the Ballsbridge Court Hotel,
7-15 September 2009. http://www.sans.org/info/46188

Here is the program lineup and what SANS alumni have said about the
courses:

7-12 September
SEC504: Hacker Techniques, Exploits & Incident Handling by Robert McArdle
This course will creep you out first then empower you - military style
- first break you down then build you up," Mark de Rijk, 4 Infosec

14-15 September
AUD521: Meeting the Minimum: PCI/DSS 1.2: Becoming and Staying Compliant by
Owen Connolly
"I wish I took this class a year ago! PCI went from being a pain to
something that will be a lot easier to manage." Steve Marriott,
Hummingbird Coaching

What is Community SANS

The Community SANS format in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa
Region) offers the most popular SANS courses in your community and in
your local language or in English. The classroom setting is small with
fewer than 25 students. The instructors are high-scoring GIAC
certification holders pulled from the best of the local mentor program
or security experts in your local community who have passed SANS
rigorous screening process called the murder boards. The course material
is delivered over a six-day period, and the course content is the same
as ones provided at a larger training event. Depending on the course,
the instructor may add relative information such as local laws and
regulations, and bring cases and examples with local flavor. Not only
will you be able to use the skills that you learned as soon as you
return to the office, but you will be able to continue to network with
colleagues in your community that you meet at the training.

COST SAVINGS:  Is the slowing economy resulting in reduced training
budgets?  With the Community SANS program, you save 15% off the regular
SANS tuition fee.

TUITION DISCOUNTS!
SANS offers group registration discounts for 4 or more students who
register from the same organization.  To obtain the Group Discount fee
and Registration Code offered for this course, contact Barbara Basalgete
at bbasalgete at sans.org PRIOR to registering, and provide the names and
e-mail addresses of all the students registering within your
organization.

If you have any questions about this event, please contact
bbasalgete at sans.org.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] REMINDER OWASP Meeting 23rd July
Message-ID: <4A66C96D.5070109@realexpayments.com>

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to send out a reminder for tomorrow nights chapter 
meeting. Full details of the speakers and location can be found below 
and on the OWASP Ireland Chapter page 
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland#tab=Chapter_Meetings).


      Agenda

Next Meeting 23rd July

Venue: Ernst & Young, Harcourt Street

Time: 18:30

*Speakers*:

*Niall Jordan (Realex Payments)*

*Evading SQL injection detection through encoding*

The purpose of this presentation is to give a basic understanding of how 
character set encoding can be used to evade common SQL injection 
detection techniques. It will start with a brief introduction to 
character set encoding to give the viewer the necessary overview to 
adequately understand the attack vectors. It will then move on to 
quickly describe normal SQL injection techniques and their detection and 
then go into detail on using character set encoding to bypass 
conventional detection methods. Practical examples will be shown along 
with methods to prevent these attacks.

*Colin Watson (Watson Hall)*

*Software Assurance Maturity Model 1.0*

he Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is now an OWASP project and 
in March became release quality. What is software assurance? What is a 
maturity model? What is SAMM? The presentation will explain how SAMM can 
be used to assess and improve software development security practices, 
reducing security risk and increasing software assurance, in all sizes 
of organisation.

Colin Watson's initial work was in the production and process 
engineering fields, but since completing an MSc in Computation at the 
University of Oxford in 1995, he has been employed in web software 
development, with an increasing focus on the security aspects. He is now 
a consultant, based mainly in London, working with developers, testers, 
auditors and people from a non-IT background to improve security 
practices. Colin joined the OWASP Global Industry Committee in January 
2009.


      Time

6:30


      Location

Ernst & Young,
Harcourt Centre, Harcourt St,
Dublin 2
Opposite the Odeon Pub

If you have any queries about the chapter meeting please feel free to 
contact myself or Eoin Keary.

Thanks,

Dave

Thanks indeed to Colin for traveling, it was my first time to hear SAMMs
being put into context and gave some food for thought. Also thanks to Niall,
in particular for raising stored procedures in the the context of SQL
injection as it is a defense that is rarely mentioned in my view.
Regards,
 Conor.

Read the "zine"

Interesting reading but key messages;

- Weak passwords will get you every time
- As will using the same passwords on multiple accounts
- Make sure you patch your systems - no major 0 days appeared to have been
used.
- Monitor your systems for unusual activity and react to it in a timely
manner

All very valid points (and best practices to follow). Kaminsky's sys  
admin skills are obviously lacking in some aspects or he was merely  
careless and probably arrogant.

Both himself and Mitnick are twats with the latter's role in the IT  
Security field being at the very least questionable IMHO. Whether or  
not any of us would be as targetted as those two is questionable, well  
maybe Eoin?
