<PRE>hi there,

Just wanted to highlight a few things that you will surely find interesting:

*Free Application Security Workshop at Realex Payments*

David Rook and Dave Stubley are going to deliver a free workshop that will
delve into the basics of application security. The workshop runs from 4pm
to 6.30pm and will be followed by the Web Awards launch, which takes place
in our offices on Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2 on August 23rd. Both
are highly skilled professionals with plenty of experience so surely is one
not to miss... more info here:
<A HREF="http://www.securityninja.co.uk/application-security/free-application-security-workshop-at-realex-payments/">http://www.securityninja.co.uk/application-security/free-application-security-workshop-at-realex-payments/</A>

*iOS Keychain Weakness FAQ*

I've recently came across this paper from the Fraunhofer Institute for
Secure Information Technology that discusses the keychain weaknesses in
Apple iOS devices. As you probably know, the keychain is intended as secure
storage for sensitive user data that should be protected even if an
attacker has physical access to the device. Therefore, the keychain stores
secrets for services used by the operating system (e.g., WiFi passwords,
VPN credentials, etc.) but also credentials stored by 3rd party apps.

Full paper here:

*OWASP AppSec Ireland 2012*

With less than a month away, we are approaching the biggest application
security conference at a thrilling speed!

I would suggest you to get your ticket for either the conference, training
or both :-) as soon as possible.

You could find fees information here:
<A HREF="http://www.cvent.com/events/owasp-appsec-ireland-2012/fees-70c5ca0f58574d2380041feca6abfb07.aspx">http://www.cvent.com/events/owasp-appsec-ireland-2012/fees-70c5ca0f58574d2380041feca6abfb07.aspx</A>

The full agenda and training details could be found here:
www.appsecireland.org

Also, remember there is going to be a Secure Coding Competition to give you
and your friends the chance to test your secure coding skills and challenge
other secure coders for the title of AppSec Ireland 2012 Secure Coding
Competition (SCC) Champions. The competition is open to everybody and is
designed to promote awareness of the benefits of designing and developing
secure applications &#8211; a skill that all aspiring and accomplished software
developers should aim to possess.

Any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,

Fabio Cerullo
