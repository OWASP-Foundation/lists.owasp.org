*ABSTRACT: *
One of the most vital pieces of a secure SDLC is security training &#8211; not
only for developers, but for Architects, QA and anyone else involved in the
creation of software. Too frequently, this is minimized, overlooked or
completely absent within an organization. In some cases, the very idea of
application security is dismissed as unnecessary. This talk starts by
making a strong argument for developer education, and how it fits into any
organization&#8217;s SDLC. Training will be put into the context of NIST&#8217;s
&#8220;Security considerations in System Development Life Cycle&#8221; Document,
Microsoft&#8217;s Simplified SDL, BSIMM3 and OWASP Open SAMM.

*BIO:*
Lecture will be delivered by Jerry Hoff, VP of Static Code Analysis
Division at WhiteHat Security. Jerry is the leader of the OWASP Appsec
Tutorial Series, WebGoat.NET and AntiSamy.NET. Jerry is a former developer,
author, and has over 10,000 hours delivering technical training. Jerry
holds a Masters degree in Computer Science from Washington University in
St. Louis.
