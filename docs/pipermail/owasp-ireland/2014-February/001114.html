<PRE>Hi all,

Now that the new year is well under way I wanted to let you know that the team is busy planning chapter meetings and some other events.  Watch this space for more details in the coming weeks. The wiki page will also be updated: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland-Dublin">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland-Dublin</A>

This year we would like to give all chapter members the opportunity to share their knowledge and expertise. So if you have a topic you would like to present to the group then let us know and we can arrange for you to present at a chapter meeting. This can be a good opportunity to present to a group of like minded people in an informal setting. Even if its something small / short we'd love to hear from you, we usually have more than one talk at a meeting so can arrange multiple short talks for a meeting. Only condition is that you agree to the OWASP speaker agreement which can be found here: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement</A>

We are also looking for organisations that might be interested in sponsoring refreshments at chapter meetings. The benefits of this include advertising at the meeting and in promotional material and your logo on our chapter website. Having supporters of meetings means that we can continue to have a social event along with the meetings. This is a great networking opportunity for all. If you think this is something your organisation would be interested in the we'd love to talk to you. 

For more details on becoming a chapter supporter see here:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Local_Chapter_Supporter">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Local_Chapter_Supporter</A>
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Single_Meeting_Supporter">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Single_Meeting_Supporter</A>

We would also like to thank BCC Risk Advisory who have have recently become OWASP corporate members with an allocation of the funds going to the Dublin chapter.

Looking forward to seeing you at the next meeting,

Fiona, Eoin, Fabio, Darren and Owen
</PRE>
