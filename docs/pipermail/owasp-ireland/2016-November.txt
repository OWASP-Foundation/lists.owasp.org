Hi Everyone,

As you may be aware, the Dublin chapter re-ran the board election earlier
in the year in order to give anyone associated with the chapter an
opportunity to have their say. The results are below.

29 (52.7%) of 55 electors voted in total. The results are unchanged from
the original vote and are as follows:

*Chapter Lead*
*Tony Clarke - 26 (92.9%)*
Owen Pendlebury (withdrawn) - 2 (7.1%)

*Treasurer*
*Myles Cullen - 26 (92.9%)*
Pat O'Callaghan (withdrawn) - 2 (7.1%)

*Secretary*
*Denise Murtagh-Dunne - 17 (60.7%)*
Brendan Gormley - 11 (39.3%)

*Public Relations & Communications*
*Antonio Stano - 21 (77%)*
Kevin D'Arcy - 6 (22.2%)

We believe in the philosophy that change is fundamentally a good thing and
as such there there will be an open call in November 2017 to allow people a
chance to put their name forward for the above positions.

We look forward to the next Dublin Chapter meeting and will be holding the
next event on Wednesday 30th November in the Hilton Hotel which you can
register for here.

As always please feel free to let us know your thoughts on anything related
to the chapter.

Kind Regards,

Tony

OWASP Dublin Chapter
