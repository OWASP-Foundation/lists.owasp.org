<PRE>Regarding
&quot;Personally, I'd love to see everyone go through on OWASP-based
source-code review, but certainly, that's not going to happen,&quot; Russo
said, referring to the expensive and time-consuming process of manual
code reviews.&quot; &quot;So the application firewall is probably the best thing
to do, but there needs to be some clarification around what it needs to do.&quot;

A WAF will not protect against session theft, CRSF, circumvention of apps
via business logic errors, weak authentication schemes, direct reference
attacks, reverse bruteforce attacks (debatable i suppose) to name a few.

The problem is that is attempting to prescribe technical solutions and using
mutual exclusive choices the PCI standard has left holes open within
applications which would not impact compliance.
&quot;We got hacked, &#8364;10,000 was moved out of X's account, but we had a WAF (web
application firewall) so we followed PCI standards&quot; (If you get what I
mean).

Sure come down to the chapter meeting on  Tuesday and we can talk about it
more.

</I>&gt;<i> PCI point 6.6 has been causing a bit of confusion around what actually
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be carried out by an organisation aiming to be PCI compliant.
</I>&gt;<i> Requirement 6.6:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ensure that all web-facing applications are protected against known
</I>&gt;<i> attacks by applying either of the following methods:
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Having all custom application code reviewed for common vulnerabilities
</I>&gt;<i> by an organization that specializes in application security
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Installing an application layer firewall in front of web-facing
</I>&gt;<i> applications.
</I>&gt;<i> Note: This method is considered a best practice until June 30, 2008,
</I>&gt;<i> after which it becomes a requirement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The code review point is where a lot of the confusion came from. In an
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to clear the confusion up the PCI council have announced the
</I>&gt;<i> following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The application code review option does not necessarily require a manual
</I>&gt;<i> review of source code. Keeping in mind that the objective of Requirement
</I>&gt;<i> 6.6 is to prevent exploitation of common vulnerabilities (such as those
</I>&gt;<i> listed in Requirement 6.5), several possible solutions may be
</I>&gt;<i> considered. They are dynamic and pro-active, requiring the specific
</I>&gt;<i> initiation of a manual or automated process. Properly implemented, one
</I>&gt;<i> or more of these four alternatives could meet the intent of Option 1 and
</I>&gt;<i> provide the minimum level of protection against common web application
</I>&gt;<i> threats:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Manual review of application source code
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Proper use of automated application source code analyzer (scanning)
</I>&gt;<i> tools
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Manual web application security vulnerability assessment
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Proper use of automated web application security vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> assessment (scanning) tools
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But more interestingly Bob Russo (President of the PCI council) said:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Personally, I'd love to see everyone go through on OWASP-based
</I>&gt;<i> source-code review, but certainly, that's not going to happen,&quot; Russo

</I>&gt;<i> to do, but there needs to be some clarification around what it needs to
</I>&gt;<i> do.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point of this email is to see how you guys feel this could effect an
</I>&gt;<i> organisations stance on Application Security? The PCI council seemed to
</I>&gt;<i> be making a good step forward with requirement 6.6 but have they now
</I>&gt;<i> diminished its effectiveness by stating you are better off not doing the
</I>&gt;<i> source code review and just implementing an application firewall?
