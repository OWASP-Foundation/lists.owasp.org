*==Talk==*

*Title:* OWASP O2 Platform - Open Platform for automating application
security knowledge and workflows

*Abstract: *In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the OWASP O2 Platform which is
an open source toolkit specifically designed for developers and security
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough
'source-code-driven' application security reviews. The OWASP O2 Platform (
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform</A>) consumes results from the
scanning engines from Ounce Labs, Microsoft's CAT.NET tool, FindBugs,
CodeCrawler and AppScan DE, and also provides limited support for Fortify
and OWASP WebScarab dumps. In the past, there has been a very healthy
skepticism on the usability of Source Code analysis engines to find commonly
found vulnerablities in real world applications. This presentation will show
that with some creative and powerful tools, it IS possible to use O2 to
discover those issues. This presentation will also show O2's advanced
support for Struts and Spring MVC.

*==Presenter==*
