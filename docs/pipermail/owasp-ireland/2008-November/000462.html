<PRE>Ladies/Gents

Thanks all for coming to the chapter meeting on Tuesday night, I hope you
all got a little from it and the opportunity to meet your fellow security
practitioners was worth while.
I shall post the presentations on the Ireland chapter page over the coming
days and can also send out copies to anyone that requires an email copy.

Thanks to John Wood, David and Conor for their great presentations and for
John flying over from the UK to give the talk.

*OWASP (Ireland) Conference 2009*
OWASP Ireland are hoping to have a full one day event in Dublin city
centre.  I hope for it to consist of a number of tracks from technical to
business focus relating to Application security. I am currently in contact
with number of universities located in Dublin city centre regarding a venue.
If anyone wishes to get involved please drop me a line directly.
I shall require assistance in PR, advertising, sponsorship etc. One aim of
the conference is to get some &quot;famous&quot; speakers to attend and also raise
awareness of application security within Ireland.

OWASP also have an &quot;*OWASP on Tour*&quot; fund such that if the chapter requires
a speaker from abroad OWASP can fund the costs so...please feel free to send
me your requests and I'll see what I can do.

rgds,

-ek
