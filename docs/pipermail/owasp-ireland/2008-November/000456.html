Hi Folks

A while back some of you took part in a survey I was running on whether or
not Ireland should have a Computer Emergency Response Team.  Well thanks to
the feedback from the OWASP Ireland members and others I am happy to say
that the first national Computer Emergency Response Team was launched today.
The CERT service will be run under the auspices of the Irish Reporting and
Information Security Service (IRISS) www.iriss.ie.  

The Irish Reporting and Information Security Service (IRISS) is a not for
profit organisation manned by a group of volunteers made up from the best
information security professionals in the country providing the following
services;

- - Incident Reporting 
IRISS provides clients with a resource whereby computer security incidents
can be reported anonymously and in confidence.
  
- - Alerts and Warnings 
IRISS provides advanced alerts and warnings on potential vulnerabilities and
threats facing their information technology infrastructure. Where possible
these alerts will be tailored specifically for the Irish audience and also
to meet clients' requirements such as non-technical alerts for owner
managers of SMEs and more detailed technical alerts for IT specialists
working for larger firms.
  
- - Conduct Research
Research and surveys will be conducted on information security matters
within Ireland to get a better understanding as to what is happening in the
Irish Internet community. This should provide meaningful statistics to help
drive home some key messages to companies and raise security awareness
levels using statistics pertinent to the Irish market.
  
- - Sanitised Attack Notifications
IRISS provides an alerting service to companies regarding attacks that are
actively happening to other Irish companies so they can better prevent the
same attack happening to them.
  
- - Provide Guidelines and Advice
IRISS will provide clients with information, advice and best practises on
how to secure and manage the information technology platforms their
businesses are dependant on.  IRISS also supports a number of online forums
where clients can raise issues and queries with our experts or others within
our community.

The above range of services are available at no cost, thanks to our
sponsors, and you can sign up
