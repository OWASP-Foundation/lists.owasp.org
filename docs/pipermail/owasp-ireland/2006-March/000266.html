<PRE>Hello good people and fellow security consultants,
a couple of things,

Firstly the meeting, a reminder.
We have Fortify software presenting at our next meeting. Well worth the 
effort to attend for security heads and also any developers you know.
The approach Fortify take in the assistance of developing secure code is 
going to be crucial going forward in the IT industry. Security is more and 
more being recognised as being a measure of Software quality.

Drop me a line (if you have not  already) if you wish to come.

Secondly:
The OWASP testing project is kicking off again after a short sabbatical. 
This project aims to deliver an application penetration testing guide and 
also a pen test checklist. If anyone wishes to be involved please don't 
hesitate to drop me a line. Knowledge of application penetration testing 
is essential.

best regards,

Eoin
OWASP Ireland Chapter Lead
