<PRE>Hi guys,

I asked Fabio for permission prior to posting this on the mailing list.

I'm currently coding a WAF evasion test-bed, to allow people to practice
common waf evasion techniques when attempting to implement SQL Injection.
It's currently still in beta, so there is yet no install script as such -
but I have included a readme file which should take you through the install
procedure effortlessly. It's still a work in progress, so keep that in
mind.

You can download the script from here: *
<A HREF="http://seanobriain.com/code/flawd.zip">http://seanobriain.com/code/flawd.zip</A> *(PHP/MySQL required)

There are 4 different levels, varying in difficultly from easy to difficult.
The first level is designed for beginners to simply become familiar with SQL
Injection. The later levels implement common filtering techniques at varying
difficulties.

Any feedback is welcome.

Regards,

Se&#225;n &quot;peann&quot; &#211; Briain
