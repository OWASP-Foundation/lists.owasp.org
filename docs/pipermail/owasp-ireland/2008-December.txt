Hi All,
There's someone here using and liking Rational Appscan. I guess it would be
classed as a penentration test tool.
Might anyone know a good cheap or free alternative ?
And yes, I should take a better look at owasp stuff too!
thanks,
JM

I have to agree with that, the scanner in the new version of Burp is good!

Hi everyone,

I thought this might be of interest to some people:
http://www.bloginfosec.com/2008/12/08/2008-the-year-of-the-sql-injection-attack/

I wrote the article for BlogInfoSec which details the basics of SQL
Injection along with its rise in recent years.

Thanks,

Subject: Breaking Google Gears' Cross-Origin Communication Model
To: webappsec at securityfocus.com



Hello,

I recently discovered a flaw in the cross-origin communication security
model of Google Gears that could allow attackers to break-out of the
same-origin policy and mount large scale user-impersonation attacks under
certain conditions.

After coordinating a fix with Google, I can now reveal the full details.
You are invited to read them at
http://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2008/12/breaking-google-gears-cross-origin-communication-model.html
.

To make sure you are secure, it is advisable to verify that you have the
latest version of Google-Gears (currently 0.5.4.2) installed on your
system. If that is not the case, it can be obtained from the Google Gears
website (http://gears.google.com).

I would like to thank the Google Gears security team for their quick
responses and the efficient way in which they handled this security issue.

Best Regards,
     Yair Amit
