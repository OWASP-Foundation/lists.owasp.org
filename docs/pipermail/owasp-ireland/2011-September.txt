Subject: [Owasp-ireland] IRISSCERT Annual Conference - 23rd November 2011
Message-ID: <CAFUMsoCFVuc9SzGBsODB=5+W4WrZHwEJp_QE7zjtd05_SU8L6Q@mail.gmail.com>

The IRISSCERT Cyber Crime Conference will be held this year on Wednesday the
23rd of November 2011 in the D4Berkley Court Hotel, in Ballsbridge Dublin.
This is an all-day conference which focuses on providing attendees with an
overview of the current cyber threats facing businesses in Ireland and
throughout the world and what they can do to help deal with those threats.

Experts on various aspects of cyber-crime and cyber security share their
thoughts and experiences with attendees, while a number of panel sessions
will provide the opportunity to discuss the issues that matter most. We are
delighted that Mikko Hypponen Chief Research Officer for F-Secure will
keynote this year's event. In addition to Mikko Hypponen there is an
excellent line up of speakers for the event
https://www.iriss.ie/iriss/irisscon.htm

The conference will be open to anyone with the responsibility for securing
their business information assets. There is no charge for those who wish to
attend and you can register at http://irisscert.eventbrite.com/

The IRISSCERT Annual Conference is an opportunity to not only increase your
knowledge but also to meet and network with your peers in a relaxed
environment.

Of particular interest to the OWASP members IRISSCERT will also host
Ireland's premier Cyber Security Challenge, HackEire (www.hackeire.ie), to
identify Ireland's top cyber security experts who compete against each other
in a controlled environment to see who will be the first to exploit
weaknesses in a number of systems and declare victory. The purpose of the
HackEire competition is to demonstrate how attackers could gain access to
your systems and allow you to learn from the event on how to prevent such
attacks from impacting your network. To enter the HackEire competition
simply go to http://hackeire.eventbrite.com/

Software is a crucial component of everyday life for much of the world. At
the same time, not a day goes by without news of a software breach affecting
thousands if not more. Application security is a serious problem impacting
organizations globally. In fact, over 10,000 information security
professionals ranked application vulnerabilities as the number one threat in
this year?s (ISC)2?  Global Information Security Workforce Study.

Join (ISC)2, along with OWASP and IEEE, and attend our September 29th
e-Symposium sponsored by Fortify, as we examine application security and
software assurance. Sessions will include looks at threat assessment, policy
development and educating users on the dangers of insecure software.

Hear from:
*Fabio Cerullo*, Managing Director
*Cycubix Limited*   "An Open Approach to Application Security" *Jason Rouse*,
Principal Consultant
*Cigital*  "The Roving Bandit: How Smart Phones are Forcing Us to Defend
Everything, Again"
*Rob Roy*, Federal CTO
*Fortify*  "Software Security: The Role of Governments and Standards"
