1. Software [In]security: All Static Analysis Tools Are Not Created Equal

The market for static analysis tools is taking off. Comparing different 
tools, however, can be a difficult task. Security expert Gary McGraw, 
author of Software Security: Building Security In, discusses the tools 
market, the pitfalls of product comparisons, and provides his 
recommendation for making the best choice.

2. 7 Security tips for secure coding your HTML 5 applications 

Since the release of HTML 5 standard is expected in 2011, it is important 
to prepare for the potential impacts on security due the adoption of HTML 
5. Currently, we can review the working draft from W3C and start looking 
at this standard from the secure coding perspective and specifically on 
how to write secure HTML 5 software.

3. SAFECode: Updated Guidance on Secure Development Practices

The Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode), a 
non-profit organization dedicated to increasing trust in information and 
communications technology products and services through the advancement of 
effective software assurance methods, today released
the second edition of &quot;Fundamental Practices for Secure Software 
Development: A Guide to the Most Effective Secure Development Practices in 
Use Today.&quot;

The report is intended to help others in the industry initiate or improve 
their own software security programs and encourage the industry-wide 
adoption of fundamental secure development methods. The paper was jointly 
developed by SAFECode's members, which include Adobe Systems Incorporated, 
EMC Corporation, Juniper Networks, Microsoft Corp., Nokia, SAP AG and 
Symantec Corp.

The second edition of the &quot;Fundamental Practices for Secure Software 
Development: A Guide to the Most Effective Secure Development Practices in 
Use Today&quot; is available for free download at 
www.safecode.org/publications/SAFECode_Dev_Practices0211.pdf.

4. OWASP AppSec Tutorials Video Series

The OWASP Appsec Tutorial Series breaks down security concepts in a easily 
accessible, friendly way. Each video is 5-10 minutes long and highlights a 
different security concept, tool or methodology.

5. OWASP Ireland Free Training Day for Members: March 11th

Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely used and 
understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and 
usefulness of those Document &amp; Tool projects, but due to a lack of 
understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or 
in the Web Application Development Life-cycle. 

This FREE course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature 
and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to 
use them.

6. OWASP AppSec Europe 2011: Call for Presentation &amp; Training Proposals
