<PRE>Hello,

OWASP are inviting you to attend the first application security event to be
held in Ireland. It proposes to be very informative with a host of key
international speakers from many industry verticals. I would urge you to
attend and also encourage individuals involved in software to attend also.

Registration for the OWASP Ireland 2009 Event is now open. It can be found
here:

*
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference#Registration">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference#Registration</A>
* &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference</A>&gt;

The event shall take place on the 10 September 2009 in Trinity College,
Dublin.

The event is based on a two track approach;
Track 1 covering technical aspects of application security.
Track 2 discussing operational, risk and management aspects of application
security.


*Training:*

Foundations of Web Application Security:

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference#Training">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference#Training</A>

Most developers, IT professionals, and auditors learn what they know about
application security on the job, usually by making mistakes. Application
security is just not a part of many computer science curricula today and
most organizations have not focused on instituting a culture that includes
application security as a core part of their IT security efforts. This
powerful one day course focuses on the most common web application security
problems, including the OWASP Top Ten. The course will introduce and
demonstrate hacking techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities
can be exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such
vulnerabilities in their code.
Training shall be offered on the day prior to the conference (9th September)
and can be booked via the registration system.

*Sponsorship options are still available:*
OWASP is a non profit organisation. It relies on voluntary membership and
and donations fro industry. If you fee you can supply any sponsorship for
this event please drop me a line.

*Keynote addresses*:

*Professor Ian Angel*:
Ian Angell has been Professor of Information Systems at the London School of
Economics since 1986. Prior to that he researched and taught Computer
Science at Royal Holloway College, and University College London. Angell has
very radical and constructive views on his subject, and is very critical of
what he calls the pseudo-science of academic Information Systems. He has
gained a certain notoriety worldwide for his aggressive polemics against the
inappropriate use of artificial intelligence and so-called knowledge
management, and against the hyperbole surrounding e-commerce.
His main research work concentrates on organizational and national I.T.
policies, on strategic information systems, and on computers and risk (both
opportunities and hazards), particularly the systemic risks inherent in all
socio-technical systems and the security threats posed to organisations by
the rapidly diffusing international information infrastructure.

*Danny Allen*:

Danny Allan is director of security research with IBM Rational. Danny came
to Rational through the acquisition of web application security and
compliance leader Watchfire in July 2007 and brings with him more than seven
years of business and security technology-related experience including
penetration testing and internal system remediation for one of Canada's
biggest universities. In his role as a security researcher he is closely
involved with enterprise global customer deployments, researching and
evaluating technologies and helping define and recommend strategic
directions.

Danny has held several critical customer facing positions, including Team
Lead, Consulting Services and Sales Engineer. Danny has published several
white papers and articles and participates in industry working groups. He
has also spoken at security events and is often called upon by key media
including Associated Press, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal for his
opinions regarding web application security.
Confirmed Speakers:
Speakers include international and local individuals from a both industry
and professional services.
