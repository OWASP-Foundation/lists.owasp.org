<PRE>Hi,
Regarding the event below:
If anyone on the list would like to present a lightning talk and is a member
of the ISSA please drop Owen or Michael an email.


The next ISSA Ireland event will be held on Tuesday May 5th at the
Westbury Hotel in Dublin, running from 1 PM to 5 PM.


The agenda for this half-day seminar is as follows:

VoIP Security - Aidan Lynch of Ernst &amp; Young and Sean Heelan of Oxford
University will discuss security considerations around Voice over IP.
Aidan has worked on several corporate VoIP projects including security
assessments and penetration testing while Sean has carried out detailed
research on VoIP security, discovered vulnerabilities in several common
products and developed a number of VoIP security tools.

&quot;Cybersecurity&quot;: Protecting Critical National Infrastructure - Hart
Rossman is Vice President &amp; CTO for Cyber Programs at SAIC, one of the
world's largest scientific, engineering &amp; technology contractors. As the
senior security professional leading SAIC's cybersecurity programmes for
the US government Hart has a unique knowledge of this area and will
discuss the US approach to cybersecurity, current initiatives in the area
and the prospect for changes under the new administration such as the
creation of a senior &quot;cyber czar&quot;.

Protecting Critical Infrastructure in Ireland and beyond - following
Hart's presentation a panel of Irish and European experts will compare US
and European approaches to protecting critical infrastructure and look at
how cybersecurity is being addressed in Ireland, in other European
countries and at an EU level.

Lightning Talks - in a change of format our final session will consist of
short presentations of around 5 to 10 minutes which we hope will give a
chance for a broad range of members to make informal presentations, with
or without slides, on any relevant topic. If you are interested in giving
one of these lightning talks please get in touch, for example you might
want to speak about a project you have worked on, a problem you have
solved or are trying to solve, a tool or technology you are using, etc.


Further details of this meeting are available on our website at
<A HREF="http://www.issaireland.org/may09">http://www.issaireland.org/may09</A> and registration is now open. As with our
recent events this meeting will be free of charge for members of ISSA
Ireland and ISACA Ireland, non-members can pay a registration fee on the
day which includes attendance as well as membership of ISSA.
