<PRE>Hello,

 *OWASP has introduced a special offer regarding the registration rates:*

*Registration fee of &#8364;90 if registered before June 30 and 100 if registered
by August 31.!!*
**
This includes a buffet lunch, refreshments, OWASP merchandise and the chance
to listen to some of our best local and international application security
speakers.

*Additional presentation information has been added to the event Website*

*Digital Security: A risky business:*

In this talk Professor Angell will take the devil's advocate position,
warning that computer technology is part of the problem as well as of the
solution. The belief system at the core of computerization is positivist
and/or statistical, and that itself leads to risk. The mixture of computers
and human activity systems spawns bureaucracy and systemic risk, which can
throw up singularities that defy any positivist/statistical analysis. Using
black humour, Angell discusses the thin line between the utility of
computers and the hazard of chaotic feedback, and ends with some advice on
how to survive and prosper amongst all this complexity.

*How to Avoid Flaws in the First Place: The OWASP Enterprise Security API
(ESAPI) Project*

Application security is arguably the most difficult IT challenge facing
organizations today. Chasing the 700 types of common weaknesses with
scanners and static analysis is a losing proposition. Rather than chasing
after these vulnerabilities, developers can address almost all of these
problems with a set of 10 to 12 strong centralized security controls. To
make it easier for developers to establish these controls, the Open Web
Application Security Project (OWASP) has created a clean, intuitive, and
open-source toolbox of the core security building blocks that every web
developer needs. In this talk, Dave will show you how to create an ESAPI for
your organization that will solve the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities,
increase assurance, and dramatically cut costs all at the same time.

*Who can afford to build secure web applications?*

Building secure web applications costs time and money. For small businesses
in this challenging environment, that is not good news. How can you develop
securely while maintaining tight budget and time constraints?
The presentation we will examine the current state of web application
development methodologies. We will highlight the challenges faced when
following these methodologies to develop secure web applications. Based on
our analysis we will suggest the next steps for the community to create a
solution that can be used by everyone, regardless of size or budget.
