We are getting ready to collect votes for the top web hacking
techniques of 2011.

https://blog.whitehatsec.com/vote-now-top-ten-web-hacking-techniques-of-2011/

These stats will be published, open, to the community when done. The
Top Ten Web Hacking Techniques list encourages information sharing,
provides a centralized knowledge-base, and recognizes researchers who
contribute excellent work.

I'm posting this here because the end result will be 100% open metrics

participants.

Thanks all,
