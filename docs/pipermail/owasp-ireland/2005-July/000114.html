<PRE>FYI:


A tool for hacking web services:

WSDigger and is written to run on C# for .NET 1.1 (Win32).

<A HREF="http://www.foundstone.com/resources/s3i_tools.htm">http://www.foundstone.com/resources/s3i_tools.htm</A>

The user specifies a UDDI and a search criteria such as &quot;weather&quot;, the 
tool
determines and displays the possible available services. The user then
selects a service to connect to and the tool gets the WSDL and displays 
the
methods such as getHumidty(); or getTemp(); The user can then apply a
payload such as SQL Injection or XPATH injection and determine if the web
service has common vulnerabilities. The tool is written to accept plugins
(we ship with 3 sample plugins for XSS, SQL Injection and XPATH 
injection).
There will be a Sourceforge CVS tree to submit plugins for the framework. 
It
should be very easy to write any number of fuzzing type plugins. The code 
is
in the download and will in the CVS at
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/foundstone/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/foundstone/</A> this week.
