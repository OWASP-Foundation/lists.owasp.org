Hey Chris, 
the problem is that clients are downloading &quot;full featured&quot; code to their
mobiles, as opposed to a form (in HTML), sort of like a thick client, but
maybe not so thick. 
The server side is not performing proper security but a better architecture
is to make the client thinner and perform all DV on the server. 
Simply put, thick client written in Java can be decompiled, altered or
studied. 
[Chris Madden] I would say that anything on the client side can be easily
reverse-engineered except for maybe&quot; tamper resistant&quot; / &quot;secure hardware&quot;
e.g. certain tokens, smartcards, etc... and that the design should assume
this. 

 Yes, java is relatively easy to reverse but then so too is assembler for
x86 or ARM7/9 in the case of mobile phones. So whether the client side is
thin or thick, java or something else the server should be doing the DV.


This altered code can be uploaded to other clients who think they are using
the real thing, like a phishing attack.?? 

[Chris Madden] But this is an issue that stands regardless of the
implementation. If the device supports download of content then obviously
the content should be authenticated. If the implementation chosen was based
on a HTML form instead of a java app/applet then this may not address the
phishing issue. e.g. if the device / user accepts non-authenticated content
anyway (mobile phone with J2ME) then some malicious app could be loaded that
emulates the form based mechanism such that the user is phished.


The decompiled code can be reviewed to find weakness. Lets say there is code
on the server doing security, but its simply a clone of the client side
code, that would be no good is a weakness was found in the client. 

[Chris Madden] Agreed and that's why full knowledge of the client side
should be assumed by the design.


The server may not be doing any App Sec, hoping client will take care of
that (a big no no). (What you are saying?) [Chris Madden] Agreed - server
should not trust client.

and loads more stuff, people more clever than myself can come up with.

Hi Eoin, 
  
So really what they're saying is that the problem is on the server side. 
  
&lt;mini-rant&gt; 
The server side should be designed to assume untrusted / malicious clients -
if knowledge of the client side compromises security then that's' a bad
design. 
&lt;/mini-rant&gt; 
  
That said, the practice of offloading security mechanisms to the client side
is far too common and it's sometimes surprising (or not) where this arises. 
  
Chris

The issue is like a Java Applet issue. The ability to decompile the client
software in the hope that the source can be code reviewed and vulns
discovered. 
Online gambling and online bank transactions via mobile are to take off over
the coming months. This may present a large opportunity for hackers and App
Sec consultants alike.
