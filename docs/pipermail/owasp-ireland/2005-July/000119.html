<PRE>Good catch!
Crowbar and Wikto apps mentioned are pretty good tools, Just tried them 
myself.
Myself and some colleagues did a &quot;bake-off&quot; between some well known 
commercial application scanners (Appscan &amp; ScanDO) about a year ago. These 
tools are pretty expensive and to be honest the FP (False positive) rate 
is extremely high (60% - 70%).

If there is a wish a presentation could be given on the findings??

Another flavour of tool is the source code analysis side of things which 
in our opinion are equally weak. They cant take into account issues like 
runtime binding to configuration files which may include security 
functionality. In general tools do not understand context which is of 
paramount importance in the assessment of risk.
