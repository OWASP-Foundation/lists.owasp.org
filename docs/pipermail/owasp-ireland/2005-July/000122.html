InfoSec certification:

<A HREF="http://nwc.securitypipeline.com/howto/164302968">http://nwc.securitypipeline.com/howto/164302968</A>

&quot;about 90 percent of security hiring managers rate security certifications 
important in hiring decisions, according to IDC, which forecasts that 
spending on infosec training will reach $1 billion in the U.S. by 2006, 
with more than 70 infosec certifications currently being offered. What's 
more, as the infosec job market expands--from 1.3 million professionals in 
2004 to 2.1 million by 2008, according to IDC--certifications serve as an 
incentive to keep valued employees motivated and up to date on critical 
technology.&quot;
