<PRE>I got the book a while back but have only read it in parts.

Its main benefit I see is that it gives a good practical overview of hacking
- the various technologies, tools and techniques. 

CISSP gives a big picture overview of security and is not at all hands-on. 

CEH gives a big picture overview of hacking but it does so in a hands-on
learn by doing way.

It covers the industry standard tools of the trade but also some of the
lesser known ones.

It is very well laid out and presented in a very readable format.

So with or without the certification/exam the book is useful in itself to
get the big picture overview. The Table of contents is available on ECC
site.

 

As for the certification itself, I personally think the main benefit of
certs is to get a job interview i.e. to meet the prerequisite job
requirements. 

Given that, I've never seen the CEH cert as a prerequisite for a job.

 

Chris

Hi Stephen, 
It seems to be a good &quot;Hands on&quot; certification as opposed to the CISSP. 
There is also some progressive certifications. 
See <A HREF="http://www.mile2.com/IT_Security_Training.html">http://www.mile2.com/IT_Security_Training.html</A> (Can get this training in
Dublin, by the way). 

You may want to look at the stuff SANS has to offer:
