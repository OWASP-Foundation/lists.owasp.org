<PRE>Hey Chris,
the problem is that clients are downloading &quot;full featured&quot; code to their 
mobiles, as opposed to a form (in HTML), sort of like a thick client, but 
maybe not so thick.
The server side is not performing proper security but a better 
architecture is to make the client thinner and perform all DV on the 
server.
Simply put, thick client written in Java can be decompiled, altered or 
studied. 

This altered code can be uploaded to other clients who think they are 
using the real thing, like a phishing attack.??

The decompiled code can be reviewed to find weakness. Lets say there is 
code on the server doing security, but its simply a clone of the client 
side code, that would be no good is a weakness was found in the client.

The server may not be doing any App Sec, hoping client will take care of 
that (a big no no). (What you are saying?)

and loads more stuff, people more clever than myself can come up with.

Hi Eoin,
 
So really what they?re saying is that the problem is on the server side.
 
&lt;mini-rant&gt;
The server side should be designed to assume untrusted / malicious clients 
- if knowledge of the client side compromises security then that?s? a bad 
design.
&lt;/mini-rant&gt;
 
That said, the practice of offloading security mechanisms to the client 
side is far too common and it?s sometimes surprising (or not) where this 
arises.
 
Chris

The issue is like a Java Applet issue. The ability to decompile the client 
software in the hope that the source can be code reviewed and vulns 
discovered. 
Online gambling and online bank transactions via mobile are to take off 
over the coming months. This may present a large opportunity for hackers 
and App Sec consultants alike.
