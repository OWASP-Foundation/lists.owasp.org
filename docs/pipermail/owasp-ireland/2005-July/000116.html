<PRE>The 19 Deadly Sins of Software Security

The book is broken up into 19 chapters, or Sins, and each is only 10-15pp
long. The Sins are:

Buffer Overflows
Format String problems
SQL injection
Command injection
Failure to handle errors
Cross-site scripting
Failing to protect network traffic
Use of &quot;magic&quot; URLs and hidden forms
Improper use of SSL
 Use of weak password-based systems
 Failing to store and protect data
 Information leakage
 Improper file access
 Integer range errors
 Trusting network address information
 Signal race conditions
 Unauthenticated key exchange
 Failing to use cryptographically strong random numbers
 Poor usability
Each chapter is carved into the following sections:

Overview
A brief introduction to the problem, not too deep, limited to 6-12
paragraphs.

The Sin Explained
The core essence of the defect, what is the principle mistake that makes
this A Bad Thing?

Sample Code Defect
Sample code. Use at least two languages if possible, and show variations if
possible too.

Spotting the Defect Pattern
Outside of the defect itself, what designs must a developer follow to lead
up to the vulnerability?

Spotting the Defect during Code Review
What to look for in code to spot the flaw. Remember, developers are time
constrained, and in many instances knowledge constrained too, so anything
you can do to make this step easier is good!

Testing the Defect during Test
Tools and techniques you can use to test for this kind of defect.

Example Defects
Examples from CVE or SecurityFocus of this kind of defect, with some
commentary from us.

Redemption Steps
How to fix the problem in code. Once again, show many languages, and if
possible, variants.

Extra Defensive Measures
Other defenses you can put in place that do not fix the problem, but may
make it harder for a bad guy to exploit a potential defect.

Other Resources
Book chapters, web links etc.

Summary
A list of DO's, DO NOT's and CONSIDER's

A critical design goal, from the outset, was to be short and to the point;
no war stories, no gossip, just the facts.
