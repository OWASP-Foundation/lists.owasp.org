Subject: [Owasp-ireland] HTML5 Attacks Workshop: Registration now open!
Message-ID: <CAFUMsoCrA5RxvXOJtA1QDgu2FDGnsS3AKH70Sf_YFiwK85hn4g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We have the great pleasure to invite you to the upcoming OWASP Dublin event
next Thursday 8th December at 17:00 in Ernst & Young offices.
*
*
On this special occasion we will have three top guest speakers and also
celebrate the end of 2011 with free food & drinks afterwards.

*Workshop #1 Details: **HTML5 - A Whole New Attack Vector*

HTML5 opens up a wide and wonderful new world for Web Designers to explore
- bringing fantastic new features that were previously only possible via
Flash or horribly over-complicated Javascript. And HTML5 is not a future
technology - chances are your favourite browser already has excellent
support built in (unless you are still using IE)

In this talk we will look at HTML5 from an attackers view-point. Because
not only does HTML5 bring us Semantic web, editable content, inbuilt form
validation, local storage, awesome video support and the long overdue death
of <div> - it also opens up a host of new opportunities for attackers.
We'll look at some of the troublesome new attacks that this new HTML5
standard introduces, how attackers can leverage these attacks to cause
untold havoc on your machine, and how - with a little bit of help from some
not so over-complicated Javascript - we can build Botnets in your Browser!

Robert is currently working as the manager of Trend Micro's Forward Looking
Threat Research team in Europe, where he is involved in analyzing the
latest malware threats, specializing in researching the future threat
landscape and criminal underground. Robert is a regular presenter for the
press and at security conferences. He has also written and lectures an MSc
module in Malware Analysis at Cork IT and is a trainer for several SANS
qualifications. A graduate of Trinity and DCU he holds several
qualifications from SANS and serves on the SANS advisory board.


Workshop #2 Details: Pwning intranets with HTML5

A huge proportion of modern software are deployed as Web Applications.
Following from this it has not taken attackers very long to migrate their
effort into targeting these applications through their common means of
access: the web browser. Taking advantage of modern web browsers features
can be an important attack vector to break into a secured intranet.

This research is based on how to perform targeted attacks by enumerating
internal resources and services belonging to a company's intranet using a
client connected to the secure network, even behind a firewall. The attack
is initiated by simply visiting a malicious website or exploiting well
known web application vulnerabilities like Phishing or Cross-Site
Scripting. It relies on web browser features such as HTML5, Websockets,
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and JavaScript, therefore, it will work in
the latest version of a full-patched browser.

The presentation shows how far an attacker can get using a maliciously
crafted website. For this purpose, several modules were designed and
implemented to run on the open source Browser Exploitation Framework
(BeEF). They allow an attacker to gather information about the victim's
computer, network, and machines or devices in adjacent networks. Using this
tool-set an attacker could discover hosts and draw a topology diagram of
the network, perform a port scan of a specific host, internal DNS
enumeration, basic OS fingerprinting and the ability to locate and exploit
targets inside the victim's domain, including services that are not using
the HTTP protocol using a technique called inter-protocol exploitation.

These tasks can be performed automatically with the set of modules we will
be presenting and shows a clear example of how the tools can be weaponized
and used by real targeted attacks, also known as Advanced Persistent
Threats (APT), like Operation Aurora or the Apache.org attack.

 Security Tools Research and Development
Message-ID: <CA+KBB07hpfHcLszVuzCqb8A4rXDjd6KM0DnjPKvz_quMDuikQg@mail.gmail.com>

The CHISEL (Computer Human Interaction for Software Engineering) group,
based in the University Of Victoria, Canada, has openings for Masters and
PhD level researchers in the area of software security analysis tools
research.

Working on a project for Defense Research and Development Canada, the
successful candidates will help to develop better tool and visualization
support for security researchers tasked with preventative assessment of
software for unknown vulnerabilities.

Applicants should have a strong interest in: software security, security
analysis tools, software visualization and software comprehension.
Knowledge of assembly and software trace analysis tools would be a plus.

Applicants should email a curriculum vitae, a list of three referees and
short summary of your research interests to Dr. Brendan Cleary
