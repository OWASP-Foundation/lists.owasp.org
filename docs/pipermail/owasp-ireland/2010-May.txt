A certificate of participation will be provided to those attending the 
event. 

== Talk ==

Title: Trials & Tribulations of WAF Implementation

Abstract: 

A web application firewall (WAF) is an appliance, server plugin, or filter 
that applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation. Generally, these 
rules cover common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL 
Injection. By customizing the rules to your application, many attacks can 
be identified and blocked. The effort to perform this customization can be 
significant and needs to be maintained as the application is modified. 

Mark will be presenting on his experience in implementing a Web 
Application Firewall solution through all phases from research to 
implementation.

== Presenter == 

Mark Hillick - Application Networking Team, Citrix Systems

Mark Hillick has 10 years experience in relation to Internet, networking, 
systems administration and security engineering. 

Mark graduated from Queen's University, where he studied Mathematics. 

Mark joined AIB from Queen's where he joined the Internet Infrastructure 
team, where he was responsible for designing, building and securing the 
Internet service in and out of AIB. He is a prominent member of the IT 
Security community in Ireland and has presented at several local security 
forums such as IISF and Owasp. Mark is one of the founding members of 
IRISS CERT, where he is also a Volunteer Incident Handler. He helped 
organise IRISSCon 2009, where he also designed and built HackEire 2009, 
the first Ethical Hacking  'Capture The Flag' contest in Ireland.

** If you would like to be a sponsor of this or a future event please 
contact Fabio directly by mail for further details.

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the 
chapter page (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland).

verticals will be represented.

** If you would like to be a sponsor of this conference please contact 
Eoin directly by mail for further details.

3. Secure Application Development on Facebook Platform

This document provides a basic outline/best practice for developing secure 
applications on the Facebook platform. Facebook applications are web, 
desktop, or mobile applications that make use of the Facebook API to 
integrate tightly with the social network experience. This document is 
designed for the Facebook developer, but it can also be used as a 
reference for non-technical readers. Depending on the reader?s level of 
technical understanding of security vulnerability classes and the Facebook 
platform, sections of the document may be skimmed or skipped

Here you could find the full article: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Facebook

4. Google Web Application Exploits and Defenses 

The folks at Google have released some web app training, along with a 
vulnerable web app sandbox to play in. The tool is called Jarlsberg. 

Google's "Web Application Exploits and Defenses" codelab can be used in a 
black-box setting, in which hackers aren't privy to the source code of the 
application they're attacking, or a white-box setting, in which they are. 

http://jarlsberg.appspot.com/ 

There's also an instructor's guide available at:

http://code.google.com/edu/submissions/jarlsberg/Jarlsberg_Instructor_Guide.pdf

For those of you who are not aware, Google have developed

http://jarlsberg.appspot.com/

A simple python server, easily run locally and fun to play with.
Covers both black and grey box scenarios.

Does not cover the terrible SQL injection or Buffer overflow attacks btw.

Good for understanding the various flavours of XSS, command injection, app
dos etc.

I've had a look at Jarlsberg and the premise seems to be the same as DVWA.
DVWA looks a lot more comprehensive, from what I've heard. DVWA covers
buffer overflow and SQL injection attacks. Ryan Dewhurst, a fellow student
at Northumbria University made it, and I implore you all to check it out.
It's free open source software and can be downloaded at
http://www.dvwa.co.uk/. 

 

On an entirely unrelated note, I've been playing around with FreeBSD with
the aim of making a distro aimed at security professionals. I've not
released it yet, but it will be available at http://www.securitybsd.co.uk.
If anyone's interested, you can follow the development of it on my personal
website, listed below.

Metrics are scary.
Apart from viewing inappropriate material look at the potential for
infection......
Many of the sites are compromised and host iframes to additional domains for
malware upload, attacks etc.

Pages 8 & 11 are quite good.

I wouldn't mind Eoin. Any chance you can send me more details? 

 

I just wanted to share that Weak Net Linux has been released. If anyone
doesn't know WeakNet Linux is a penetration testing and computer forensics
distro of linux with an emphasis on performance and having a comprehensive
set of utilities for the pen-tester, technician and forensics professional.
It features custom made applications which you won't find in any other
distro, and in general looks pretty cool. I've not had a chance to play
around with it yet, but it looks pretty cool and I'm excited about getting
my hands on it and having a play with it.

 

You can download it here

== Talk ==

Title: Define Security Requirements - A practical approach
 
Abstract:   

The Data Protection Act states that "appropriate security measures" must 
be taken to protect personal data. How do you specify the appropriate 
security measures for a website which processes personal data? It is an 
important step in a development project, but is often neglected. In this 
talk, Alexis will descibe his own experiences of assessing web 
application, and will also look in more detail at what the Data Protection 
Commissioner says. He will then take a fictional website and look at a 
practical approach to specifying the security requirements that the 
fictional application should meet. This will use the kind of risk-based 
techniques outlined by OWASP or the Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle 
(SDL). Issues discussed will include encryption, authentication, access 
control, audit, etc. The result will be a list of security requirements 
that can be carried into the design and development phases. Attendees 
should be able to apply the ideas to their own development projects.

== Presenters == 

Alexis FitzGerald

For the last six years Alexis has worked for Rits Information Security 
Group, where he performs application penetration testing assignments as 
well as advising clients on application security issues. Before that, he 
spent many years as a developer (mainly in the financial sector), and he 
continues to be involved in development. Alexis holds an MSc in 
Information Security from the University of London, Royal Holloway.
Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the 
chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland ).
