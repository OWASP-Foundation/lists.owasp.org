<PRE>Hi,
This (below) may be of some interest to some of you? (Free SANS
Meeting/Seminar)
also if any of you are looking for a career as a client facing security
consultant drop me a line.
One last thing,
Does anyone wish to get more involved in OWASP Ireland chapter, I was hoping
to create a &quot;board&quot; of leadership so we could have more frequent meetings
and a wider range of topics?
Drop me a line on this also if you wish?

happy Monday :)

Eoin

Hi Eoin

The SANS Institute www.sans.org are running a training course in
Dublin this week and on Wednesday are hosting a free event open to
all.  I thought it may be of interest to you and others from OWASP.

Regards

Brian

As part of the SANS training taking place next week in Moran's Red
Cow Hotel a community night open to all will be held on Wednesday
night at 18:30 in the Pearse Suite in the hotel.

There will be two presentation topics;

* Network Early Warning Systems by Mike Poor
* Time-to-Live of a Website by Arrigo Triulzi

Bio of the speakers:

Mike Poor is a founder and Senior Security Analyst for the DC firm
Intelguardians LLC. In his recent past life he has worked for
Sourcefire, as a research engineer, and for the SANS Institute
leading their Intrusion Analysis Team. As a consultant, Mike conducts
forensic analysis, penetration tests, vulnerability assessments,
security audits and architecture reviews. His primary job focus
however is in intrusion detection, response, and mitigation. Mike
currently holds both GSEC and GCIA certifications and is an expert in
network engineering and systems, network and web administration. Mike
is an author of the international best selling Snort 2.1 book from
Syngress, and is a Handler for the Internet Storm Center.

Arrigo Triulzi, trained in Pure Mathematics, holds an MSc in
Mathematical Computation from Queen Mary, University of London, and
is working towards a PhD in Algebraic Computation. He is co-founder
and Chief Security Officer of K2 Defender Limited, a bespoke high-end
IDS solutions provider. Arrigo is also a free-lance consultant in IT
Security with particular expertise in secure network design, network
security analysis, and incident handling. He is also the
administrator of the IDS Europe mailing list. Having worked with both
popular and less common flavours of Unix he is comfortable working in
any heterogeneous networking environment and his knowledge also
includes esoteric operating systems such as Guardian/NSK. Arrigo is
co-inventor in an EU patent for a high-performance distributed IDS
design, and has written on a variety of security topics. Recent work
includes web research into IDS deployment on IPv6, firewall
verification using IDS, and distributed concept virii.

The presentations will be followed by a drinks reception hosted by
SANS.
