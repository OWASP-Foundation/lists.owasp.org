Message-ID: <CAFUMsoAPfPbaLiwVHoH2vjVoA1u6-nofrjsucDFOck6ULQ7rgw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We have the great pleasure to invite you to the upcoming OWASP Dublin event
next 20th October at Ernst & Young offices.
*
*
*Workshop Details:*

*A practical introduction to pentesting using the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy
(ZAP)
*
The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration
testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience
and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to
penetration testing as well as experienced pentesters.

This 2 hour course will include:
* An introduction to the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)
* The principals behind ZAP
* An overview of its functionality
* A hands-on session using ZAP to pentest an example vulnerable application
* A demonstration of using ZAP to perform security regression tests
* An indication of where ZAP is heading

The course will be suitable for experienced pentesters who would like to
learn about ZAP and developers or functional testers who are interested in
using ZAP to learn more about application security.

Attendees who wish to take part in the hands-on session will need to bring
along a laptop.

A list of software to be installed prior to the course will be distributed
closer to the event.

Attendees new to application security are advised to watch the OWASP Appsec
tutorial series of vidoes on YouTube:
http://www.youtube.com/user/AppsecTutorialSeries


*Guest Speaker:*

Our guest speaker is Simon Bennetts (a.k.a Psiinon) who has extensive
experience developing web applications and strongly believes that you cannot
build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them.

He works for a UK FTSE 100 company and leads a team that develops and
penetration tests secure web applications, and also gives talks and training
courses on web application security.

Simon is the project lead for the OWASP Zed Attack
Proxy<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project>
 and OWASP Data Exchange
Format<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Data_Exchange_Format_Project>
projects
and is the author of the 'Penetration Testing for
Developers'<http://pentest4devs.blogspot.com/>
 blog.

He is also one of the chapter leaders for the newly formed
Manchester<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester>
 chapter.

Simon has a B.Sc in Computing and Information Systems from Manchester
University <http://www.manchester.ac.uk/>.
