Hi All

We received some feedback recently that many of you would like to see a technical or training event being hosted by the OWASP Dublin Chapter. We have listened to this feedback and are delighted to announce that we will be running a workshop which covers the fundamentals  of secure application development. There will also be a hacking demo which will give you an idea of the level required of a certified OSCP. This event will take place in the Morgan McKinley Offices on August 27th and will run from 16.00 - 20.00. 
This will be a packed event so ensure you register early to avoid disappointment. Registration is free for OWASP members with a small fee for non-members.

Link to register : https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-dublin-secure-application-development-oscp-hacking-demo-tickets-48667998293?ref=estw
Spread the word to anyone you think will be interested.

See you there,

Denise Murtagh - Dunne
OWASP Board Member
