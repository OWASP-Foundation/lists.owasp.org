I've not had chance to play with this myself yet so I can't comment on
good or bad points.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] virus checker for file upload ?
Message-ID: <93fef5e10807290946k363e088aw22e262f864c61f7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I'm wondering if anyone knows a good way to check for viruses on up-loaded
files?

I've an application running in a java-based application server, which
accepts file uploads. So I guess the ideal would be something which could be
built into the java application itself, and run during or just after the
upload.


I think the uploaded files should be xml, if so I'm sure that will simplify
matters.

Also, the app should only be used by school secretaries, so they are
hopfully not the most malicious of web users.


Thanks!

JM

You may want to check out an API from OPSWAT (www.opswat.com) called 
Metascan. It supports integration of most AV packages in the market and 
has several built-in engines.
