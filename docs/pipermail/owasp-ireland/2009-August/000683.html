<PRE>One important clarification on last evenings post that I forgot to make -
in relation to the point about professionalism:
There are a couple of dozen folk throughout the world who are recognised
immediately as consummate professionals by their given name. I place these
in a very special category that have no need of letters. In fact, those that
hold certifications and use the designation in their working lives, honour
the certification bodies by doing so.
Regards,
Richard

CPEs first - Many of my CPEs are maintained by attending the monthly
e-symposia from (ISC)2 and ISACA.  I normally access them via the
archive after a couple of months and get them done in one large traunch.
Between the two, I can claim about 60 CPE hours a year if I'm bothered (3
CPEs per symposia, by about 10 instances from each organisation per year).
Past that - every hour that you receive a vendor presentation or demo; every
exam question that you write and submit; every time you read the newsletter
and answer the Quiz; every hour that you volunteer your services on a
committee or board; ....
There are so many ways to earn CPEs free of charge, that only require the
time and effort from each of us.
First port of call for quick &amp; easy (and free) CPEs
<A HREF="https://www.isc2.org/e-symposium/default.aspx">https://www.isc2.org/e-symposium/default.aspx</A>

AMFs - so what do we get for our $65?  We get free seminars, we get
reductions on a huge amount of vendor training, we get free e-symosia
monthly, we get a quarterly newsletter, we get deliverables (e.g. recent
awareness material submitted by members),  discounts off the academic
journal, online fora, and a host of other &quot;stuff&quot;.   Have a look at
<A HREF="https://www.isc2.org/member-benefits.aspx">https://www.isc2.org/member-benefits.aspx</A>
Most of all, we get the advantage of putting CISSP after our name. This
identifies us as professionals (this is what we do for a living), as
distinct from amateurs. It doesn't necessarily make us good professionals  -
as MD doesn't necessarily guarantee good doctors, but would you want an
amateur treating you for a medical complaint?

In terms of competing certification bodies, some organisations certainly do
provide more content than (ISC)2 - but they also charge significantly higher
AMFs!
Pertinent question being: What offers best value for money?

Regards,

Richard
