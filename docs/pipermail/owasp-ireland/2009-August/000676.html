<PRE>Hi Eoin,

 

I am a CISSP, certified in August 2007. 

 

It is interesting that you brought up such a subject at this point as I
frantically struggle to maintain my annual CPE's (I don't suppose you
fancy having 6 hours worth of chapter meetings in the next 7 days?) I am
beginning to rethink the merits of actually maintaining the
certification.

 

At this stage 80% of my CPEs are from podcasts. So for my AMF's what
does ISC2 do for me? 

 

According to its official website:

&quot;In a world full of security threats, the need for skilled,
knowledgeable information security professionals has never been
greater..... Certification by a respected accreditation organization is
becoming indispensable to the information security professional. .....
credentialed practitioners have a higher earning potential, as well as
greatly expanded career opportunities. &quot;

Is there a market for CISSPs? A quick search for the key word in Irish
Jobs returns 5 hits. The same search for 'Business Analyst' returns 5949
hits.

 

Late last year while job hunting the only 'CISSP desirable but not
essential' role I was offered was as a glorified DBA with a not very
glorified salary.

 

So the cycle continues, I take the Project Management and Business
Analyst roles moving further and further away from gaining the 'Industry
Experience' required for a CISSP aligned Security role, and practice IT
Security in my 'spare time' to retain my certification.

 

Any arguments in favour of the CISSP as a career advancing certification
would be greatly welcome!

 

Regards,

Mary

Hi,
Dave Lowry and myself were discussing the merits of having CISSP.
I believe it is useful from a credential perspective but does not imply
skill or aptitude for security in general.
 
May I ask who is CISSP and what do they think of its usefulness and
relevance?
 
BTW, every hour in attendance at the OWASP event on Sept 10th is worth
one CPE credit towards your CISSP or CISA.
 
Eoin
