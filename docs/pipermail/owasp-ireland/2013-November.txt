I would like to congratulate Fabio on getting elected to the global OWASP board. He has also been awarded a WASPY award for his Community Involvement. Two great achievements. Well done Fabio!

We now have both Fabio and Eoin on the global board, great work for such a small country as ours :)

Fiona,

Thanks for your message. I also like to extend my gratitude to all those in
the OWASP Ireland community who supported my election.

As usual, please feel free to reach me out with questions & suggestions.

Regards,
Fabio
