In my experience 10 to 15 years ago writing secure code wasn't on the
agenda (for me at least). Writing "good code" was. At times it was a
struggle to get time to document code, write unit tests, regression tests
even basic things like requirements and design weren't always high on the
agenda.


Nialls example of two developers attending the same weekly development
meeting reminds me of similar situations from that time. One developer
saying he can complete the task in two days basically hacking some code
together and complete the other "admin" tasks such as documentation late.
The other developer saying two weeks as he wants to do a design and create
unit tests and so on.

In the beginning people sided with the first developer but over time
everyone came to understand the importance of following a development
process, commenting code, testing code and so on. The reason for this was
the long term cost of writing good code was less than that of writing bad
code.


Now these things are standard, developing involves writing unit tests,
commenting your code and so on. I think the same is starting to happen with
secure development, it will take time but while it may still be seen as an
add-on overtime it will become part of what developers do.

Message-ID: <CAFUMsoB6E8xGGNcT9R6=ewUKx4ucW04g1KHKxPoxsSaUUi8AtA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We have the great pleasure to invite you to the upcoming OWASP Dublin event
*next Friday 20th April at 17:00* (registration opens at 16:30) in *Google
Ireland Engineering offices *at One Grand Canal Plaza Building (located on
Grand Canal Street Upper, beside the junction of Warrington Place and
Barrow Street).

You could find a placemark for the building on this map :
http://goo.gl/ZGASA

This event is free and open to EVERYONE but registration is mandatory.

Registration URL: http://www.regonline.com/xssattacks

*Workshop #1 Details - **

XSS Attacks | skacttA SSX
 *

Eoin Keary, Global Vice Chair of OWASP and Director
withBCCRiskAdvisory.com<http://bccriskadvisory.com/> shall
discuss the common and not so common issues related to XSS. He shall
demonstrate sample XSS exploits and discuss how such issues can be
mitigated:

- Attacking using, and defending against our old friend XSS
- Why traditional HTTP testing is not enough
- Why client side security is useful.
- Client side API's to defend against XSS: OWASP ESAPI, ESAPI4JS
*Guest Speaker: *Eoin Keary
*Twitter:*  @eoinkeary

*Workshop #2 Details: Windows 7 Security*

This presentation will detail the security features of Windows Phone 7 with
an emphasis on how developers can produce Windows Phone 7 apps that are
free from common mobile application security vulnerabilities.

*Guest Speaker: *David Rook
*Twitter:*  @securityninja

David Rook is the Application Security Lead at Realex Payments in Dublin.
He is a contributor to several OWASP projects including the code review
guide and the Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet. He has presented at
leading information security conferences including DEF CON, BlackHat USA
and RSA Europe. In addition to his work with OWASP David created a security
resource website and blog called Security Ninja.

The Security Ninja blog was nominated for five awards including the best
technology blog at the Irish Blog Awards, the Computer Weekly IT Security
blog award and was a finalist for the Irish Web Awards Best Technology
Site. In 2011 David received a Developer Security MVP award from Microsoft
and is a finalist for the SC Magazine Rising Star 2012 award. David strives
to practice what he preaches and has backed up his work experience by
developing two open source security code review tools called Agnitio and
the Windows Phone App Analyser.
