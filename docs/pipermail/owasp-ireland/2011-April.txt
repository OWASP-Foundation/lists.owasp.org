netizens the option of shielding themselves from ad networks that attempt 
to track their web behavior, and the idea was soon rolled into Firefox.

Hi
Im presently a full-time Phd student (Queens Belfast) studying reverse engineering of malware/software security.
I was previously a software developer for 18 years (telecoms and finance) and now looking to join group/organisation to contribute and learn.

What is the possibility of joining your group and how active are the members?

Thanks,
Phil

Hi Fabio,

I notice the training agenda has been published.
http://www.appseceu.org/?page_id=410

Do Training 1, 2 and 3 each take two days, i.e. it is only possible to
attend one of these?

How do we register for the training?

Best regards,
Kieran
