<PRE>Well there are three courses of action that I can see.
 
1. We continue with spam filters and legal threats. The business value of
email decreases to the point where it is not used, and other technologies
will take over. Already companies are looking at things like IM to
communicate with less noise. But that just opens up another target.
 
2. Strengthen authentication for mail. ISP's should refuse to route mail
that cannot be traced to its point of origin. There are moves in this
direction as mentioned already but I'm not sure that they will gain
universal acceptance. e.g PKI, make sure all mail is signed by your outgoing
mail server. It would be easy to delegate trust to certain CA's. I know all
the problems with PKI but at the very least all that RSA verification will
slow down the throughput, DOS by crypto?  ;-)
 
3. Something else?

The above, coupled with the recent death threats aimed at the people
behind spamhaus, makes one wonder how best do we put these people out
of business?


Maybe you can't. Organised crime and racketeering have existed for far
longer than this Internet fad. The very fact that some people are attempting
to shut down the spammers is resulting in the response. Trying to solve this
with technology by &quot;civilians&quot; would appear to be a false start. 

Legislation, international cooperation, resources (money money money) ... I
don't think there's much hope down that path either ;)

Suggestions? Perhaps Minister McDowell could resolve the matter?
