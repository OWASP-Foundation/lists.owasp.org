1) In order to defeat spammers, DoS them == get DoS'ed in return ... I don't
think you would need to possess clarvoyance to see that one coming (seems
largely unethical to take this sort of action, could potentially have a
destabalising effect on innocent intermediary/host networks)

2) Redirecting your DNS to a 3rd party infrastructure during a DoS attack
doesn't strike me as a very clever thing to do either ;-)

What is worrying about this story is that it demonstrates the
criminal mindset and resources available to spammers.  They can
obviously commandeer large number of machines to direct their attacks
against whomever and whenever they want and do not care what impact
it has on the innocent bystander. 

The above, coupled with the recent death threats aimed at the people
behind spamhaus, makes one wonder how best do we put these people out
of business?

Maybe you can't. Organised crime and racketeering have existed for far
longer than this Internet fad. The very fact that some people are attempting
to shut down the spammers is resulting in the response. Trying to solve this
with technology by "civilians" would appear to be a false start.

Legislation, international cooperation, resources (money money money) ... I
don't think there's much hope down that path either ;)

Suggestions? Perhaps Minister McDowell could resolve the matter?

Well there are three courses of action that I can see.
 
1. We continue with spam filters and legal threats. The business value of
email decreases to the point where it is not used, and other technologies
will take over. Already companies are looking at things like IM to
communicate with less noise. But that just opens up another target.
 
2. Strengthen authentication for mail. ISP's should refuse to route mail
that cannot be traced to its point of origin. There are moves in this
direction as mentioned already but I'm not sure that they will gain
universal acceptance. e.g PKI, make sure all mail is signed by your outgoing
mail server. It would be easy to delegate trust to certain CA's. I know all
the problems with PKI but at the very least all that RSA verification will
slow down the throughput, DOS by crypto?  ;-)
 
3. Something else?

<rant>
There was one suggestion to fight spam,
Charge per mail!! I Dont think it would ever work but it may force
owners of vulnerabile mail servers to tighten up and mail relay
spoofing could be reduced.

Also one thing to note is we all get much more spam in real life, look
ato all the junk mail we get in our postbox! (Waste of paper in my
view, like email spam is a waste of electricity).
Talking about wasting electricity, wouldnt it be nice to charge for
power consumption your CPU/memory etc uses in  processing spam email,
wounder if this would ever work (doubt it).

So Whos going to Belgium next week?

Blue Security Kicked While It's Down

Looks like the Spammers really have had it in for Blue Security. 
They apparently attacked the companies Blue Security was using to
provide DDOS protection.  This has resulted in a number of other
companies also being affected.

<rant>
There was one suggestion to fight spam,
Charge per mail!! I Dont think it would ever work but it may force
owners of vulnerabile mail servers to tighten up and mail relay
spoofing could be reduced.

Also one thing to note is we all get much more spam in real life,
look ato all the junk mail we get in our postbox! (Waste of paper in
my view, like email spam is a waste of electricity).
Talking about wasting electricity, wouldnt it be nice to charge for
power consumption your CPU/memory etc uses in  processing spam email,
wounder if this would ever work (doubt it).

So Whos going to Belgium next week?

Hello,
If anyone from Ireland is going to from Ireland to the AppSec Europe
chapter drop me line. Maybe we could meet up for some beers? I could
also introduce some of you to the project leads if you are interested.
thanks,

Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] Dublin Java Meetup on Application Security
Message-ID: <20060531102607.1699.qmail@web30908.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am the organiser of the Dublin Java Meetup Group (http://java.meetup.com/15/), and a lurker on the OWASP mailing list for the last couple of months. The DJMG's focus is on running informal monthly tech discussions with a Java focus over drinks with a couple of quick presentations (about 15 mins - half an hour) up front to get the ball rolling.

I am looking at running this month's meetup, taking place two Tuesdays from now, around application security, which I feel is really paid lip service to in most organisations. One of our guys, John Latham, is going to be talking about using Acegi Security for authentication and authorisation in Java applications, and I was thinking that it would be good to have someone from this forum to come in and discuss some of the other facets of web app security (OWASP Top 10 perhaps). If anyone is interested in coming down in this capacity or if you would just like to come down, add your insights and have a few beers on a Tuesday night please reply to my email directly. Cheers,

Jakub Korab
