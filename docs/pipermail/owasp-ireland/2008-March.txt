Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Code Crawler, New version
Message-ID: <f3193c100803100644q7144755cr3724bc250165f931@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Alessio has put a new version of the OWASP code review tool, Code crawler,
available for download.
It has a totally new look and feel and also runs SQL Server express for the
definitions.
The source is available also. Suggestions on new functionality are welcome.

Code crawler is a complementary tool associated with definitions defined in
the code review guide. It works best using both the guide and tool together.
Remember this is a beta tool, stable, but much functionality to implement.
It can be downloaded from the OWASP code review project site:

Maybe a bit slow on this one but I'd thought I'd share it

A PCI compliant company was compromised and an estimate of 4.2 million cc
numbers were obtained.
The issue arises that the company were PCI compliant and now the blame game
has ensued. The PCI assessors are being blamed, there is mention of
ambiguity regarding the PCI standard, where to apply some of the technical
controls etc..

I think this is another example of PCI compliance being just that - a 
compliance standard. Being compliant (as is demonstrated here and with 
TJX) does not always equate to being secure.

PCI is ambiguous and it could be improved to try and make companies both 
secure and compliant. As for who is to blame, is it not a case of 6 of 
one and half a dozen of the other?

Sorry I forgot to say in my last mail.
 
Who is to blame?  Well while everyone points the fingers at
Hannafords, the PCI assessors and VISA/Mastercard themselves - I
suggest we look at the criminals who conducted the breach.  After all
if someone breaks into my house, is that my fault? my alarm company's
fault? or that of the lock manufacturers? or is it the criminal who
committed the burglary?

Dealing in absolutes is an error. There is no "secure". There are security
controls and depending on what, how, where, when, why, if, biff, bam, and
boom they are implemented and managed their effect is a quasi-linear
progression along the cost-versus-hardcore axis where they intersect at the
"good enough for us at this moment in time" point. Compliance may equate to
"good enough" security controls, but suggesting there is a final resting
point for IT expenditure on all things security is folly.

PCI has gone through a round of improvements and perhaps it will continue to
do so in the future. Whilst I don't have a history of other safety standard
from our recent industrialised history, I imagine there are comparable
observations to be made. Cars did not start off with airbags and they still
don't prevent people from killing each other on country roads or on
overpriced toll roads.

As for the PCIDSS being ambiguous, I agree. However, I think this is perhaps
a necessary quality: Not all companies are equal. I would suggest that
VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/etc wanted to establish a baseline for their own
"insurance" purposes (imho and used here as a loose term).  Does it raise
the proverbial bar? In my experience, it probably has done for some clients
I've worked with and maybe not for others, but again this is an example of
the underlying intention functioning (imho). Another example is
BS7799/ISO17799 certification. No doubt any future attempts to provide a
super-compliance-standard will end up with ambiguity too.  The point is that
the organisation must interpret the "ambiguity" to suit their needs and
explain why they have interpreted it as such to the auditor and, where
applicable, compliance body.  The aim could be to provide the least amount
of ambiguity as possible, but being overly prescriptive would perhaps be
more prone to failure when issues such as capabilities, economics and other
factors are considered.

As for who is to blame? I'm sure they both have insurance ... *if* no
personal data was lost, is this such a big issue? (from a consumers
perspective)

I fully understand that 100% security isn't realistic -  Thanks for the 
clarification though ;-)

I agree that the standard will always be ambiguous but do you not feel 
that the interpretation of the standards is often what leads to a lower 
level of security than is required?

My own opinion is that any breach like this is a big issue, from a 
consumers perspective if they have lost *any* data it should be a point 
of concern.

I think interpretation of standards leads to a level of security that is
reasonably required by the organisation interpreting them. Of course, I
assume that the organisation is interpreting them with a modicum of
expertise in the field, which may be provided via internal resources or
through external consultancy. What they end up with might be "lower" than
what is "ideal", which may not be "perfect", but may be all that particular
entity can achieve at that stage of their
iterative-information-security-management-lifecycle. This reinforces my
original point, which evidently my elaboration failed to illuminate. The PCI
standard is applicable in different ways to different entities and this is
not only reflected in the ambiguity of the language within the standard, it
is also reflected in the multi-tiered compliance and conformance
requirements laid out by the PCI themselves.

Objectivity is dead. Long live Subjectivity.

Re: "breach". Granted, it is of concern, but perhaps less so considering the
information that was lost was the card issuers and not the private
information of the customer. I was also being somewhat facetious.

David you have hit the nail on the head regarding the expertise in
understanding standards such as PCI.
This is a real big issue as following the PCI standard in a blind compliant
fashion is a complete false sense of security. The PCI standard is
technically incorrect in some of its assumptions for a start.

The companies that perform the certification are required to be QSAs [1].
So, in theory, the expertise in deciding whether or not the controls are
suitable should be found there. I believe the only aspect of your PCI
project that a QSA cannot help with is implementation of controls, but they
can/should/will for extra money provide the necessary guidance regarding the
standard. Will this guidance always be correct? The same? Useful? Maybe not,
but at the end of they day the objective is to find a suitable agreement
between client and QSA on what controls should be in place and whether these
are suitable. This is also how things work during an ISO27001 certification:
Your risk assessment and management activities justify what controls are
required and management procedures measure the effectiveness of these,
certification being granted on the continuing adherence to (mostly) your own
stated objectives in line with the standard. Again, accredited organisations
can provide guidance (similar caveats) but can't get their hands dirty.
Certification holders are like graduates, some are clearly PhD material and
others are not, but you use the resource you have or can afford to get the
job done. The quality might be different, but it doesn't mean it's always
wrong.

The quality of the QSA (individuals and organisations) are likely to vary
(only human), but achieving the stated goals should carry a reasonable
consistency (would be interesting to see PCI do some analysis and anonymous
reporting on this). In the case cited (hannaford) the details are sketchy,
but apparently they were compliant. Unless PCI can find negligence on either
part (presumably there's an investigation due or taking place already), then
the insurance policies of the PCI member organisations will probably kick
in. I wonder what the PCI members premium reductions were based on the
PCIDSS? ;-) Of course as someone quite rightly pointed out: The Criminal
should be blamed; but if you leave your car window open in Castleknock,
you're asking for your horn to be beeped.

It might be worth highlighting that the aim of the PCI is not to provide
security controls for the entire organisation, but to ensure the PCIDSS
defined controls are in place to protect card holder data. I like to think
of PCIDSS as an insurance policy, rather than the security standard the
world has so earnestly waited upon. In my experience of PCIDSS,
ISO17799/27XXX, cobit, and others it appears obvious that these "best
practices" are "good practices" but usually only as good as the expertise of
the team that designs, implements, and (perhaps most importantly) manages
them.  That's not to say that the standards are themselves bad, it just
highlights that they fulfill an objective and I believe that object is not
to provide a framework to ensure you "never get hacked", but to ensure that
you have a set of controls in place that cover a range of strategic and
operational security controls in place suitable to the type of data you
protect (PCI specifically focusing on cardholder) and the capacity of your
organisations resources (financial, people, etc). How this is achieved is
left to the organisation, but it's not a complete failing of the standards
if something goes wrong. Standards can't tell you what firewall to buy, or
what amount of documentation you need in place, or whether you should code
in Java, dotNET, or TCL/TK (!). OK, they could if the standards stated those
things, but imagine the amount of standards we would have then!

I do agree with you that PCIDSS has quality issues and it misses or glosses
over some key elements, but again if we take the incremental view then
perhaps these can be worn now and washed in the future? There are plenty of
software apps out there that continue to offer *ancient* attack classes that
we would all love to see eradicated from code, yet we continue to use them
anyway, perhaps in the hope or under the observation that they may and will
get better (no names). Perhaps there already exists a Security Standard
Secure Security Development Security Lifecycle ...

Disclaimer: I'm giving my experience and knowledge of the subject matter,
which may or may not be totally based on fictional scenarios.

Hi Andrew,
Congrats is in order btw.
I believe Hannaford were PCI compliant according the information at hand.
Which highlights the meaning of compliance as opposed to secure. Compliance
is simply a business enabler to show "we are making an effort" as opposed to
the esoteric "we are secure" statement IMO.

Reasonable room for doubt at the moment, due to flaky details.  However,
their statement would negate Requirement 3 failure (if accepted at face
value = during transmission):

[The Reg] "The stolen data was limited to credit and debit card numbers and
expiration dates, and was illegally accessed from our computer systems
during transmission of card authorisation," Hannaford chief exec Ron Hodge
said in an open letter to customers
posted<http://www.hannaford.com/Contents/News_Events/News/News.shtml>on
the grocer's website. [/The Reg]

Plenty of room for failure in the other ones you mentioned. I guess a the
crux of this could be: Perhaps they were rated as compliant during an audit,
but their controls fell by the wayside afterwards. Who knows ... speculation
is distracting, where's my day gone ;-)

Re OWASP Top 10 compliant we, OWASP have a big issue here as many of the
vendors of scanning tools have an "OWASP Top 10" rule base that can be used.
OWASP have not been consulted on this to my knowledge so if one runs this
rule base and it comes up with no issues they can say they are OWASP Top 10
compliant. - plain silly IMHO

Also "Develop all web applications based on secure coding guidelines such as
the Open Web Application Security Project guidelines." - Sure they can do
that and say they do seen as OWASP does not have verification or
certification criteria. Who's to say they are not doing this, We have the
OWASP guides, dev, test and review but no certification.

Also one can be compliant and certified as such, next day not be compliant
but certified as compliant for the next 3 months until the next audit.

Expiration date & PAN are allowed to be stored (is a secure manner) but it
seems that the data was intercepted in transit (correct me if I am wrong).
Re storing CC numbers (PANS) many large popular store such numbers such as
Amazon.com, Play.com etc to "enhance the customer experience" and let the
customer purchase via 1-click.

I really doubt that Hannaford was PCI DSS compliant:

* Requirement 3 - Protect Card Holder Data. Losing 4.2 million records  
requires failing Section 3.1 "Keep cardholder data to a  
minimum" (basically ditch the PAN and expiry as soon as you're done  
with them), and Section 3.4 "Render PAN, unreadable anywhere where it  
is stored". FAIL.

* Requirement 6 - Section 6.1, keeping up with patches. I don't know  
of any site that meets PCI's 1 month deadline to install new patches  
for critical components. It would be surprising to me if Hannaford did  
this. Possible fail.

* Section 6.5 - do a Top 10 review. This is the old Top 10 2004. 6.5.8  
is "Insecure storage" - enough said! FAIL

* Requirement 10 - Monitor and Test Networks and Requirement 11  
Regularly Test security systems and processes. In particular section  
10.6:

"Review logs for all system components at least daily. Log reviews  
must include those servers that perform security functions like  
intrusion detection system (IDS) and authentication, authorization,  
and accounting protocol (AAA) servers (for example, RADIUS)."

and 11.3.2 - conduct annual application layer pen tests
and 11.4 and 11.5 which says to install network and host IDS and  
network IPS and file integrity monitoring software. These should have  
immediately notified admin staff of changes.

Hannaford didn't detect the breach for nearly three months. That  
implies a lack of effective intrusion detection and monitoring EVEN if  
they had the above items in place, operational, and logging  
successfully, and someone is monitoring them. Which I highly doubt.  
FAIL.

Arguable:

* Section 6.6 - mandates a code review or a web application firewall,  
but only AFTER JUNE 30. They can be compliant up to now with neither  
of these in place. We know that WAFs today are simply not enough to  
prevent attacks from a motivated, skilled attacker. They are great  
defense in depth and they do knock out script kiddie attacks. If  
Hannaford obtained a code review, then the assessor wasn't  
particularly good, or the firm refused to fix known issues, or both. I  
think this is the area we will see the lawyers involved with if it can  
be argued that 6.6 is REQUIRED to be complied with today. I don't  
believe so.

In my personal opinion, even given the limited information that is  
public, from the first two issues above alone, we can assume Hannaford  
were/are non-compliant.

PCI DSS makes it abundantly clear what folks must do to be safer:

Step 1.  Don't store CC numbers. Really, really, really don't store  
them. You don't need them.
Steps 2..153 However, if you want to damage your business reputation,  
destroy customer confidence, lose shareholder value, set a bunch of  
money on fire by protecting information you don't need (and shouldn't  
want), then here goes... do this wishy-washy list of items. But do it  
properly, or you'll get pwned.

Hannaford ignored #1 and got pwned even though they did *some* of the  
next 153 steps required for PCI DSS. In PCI DSS 1.2, they really  
should make it real short and sweet:

There are no valid business reasons for storing CC's. If you do, you  
fail PCI DSS compliance. This is how you use authorization numbers for  
these common business cases:

That's a one pager in my view.
