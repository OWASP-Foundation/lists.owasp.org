So, either OWASP are moving into the jewellery business, the ACL has broken on the list or the server has some ownership issues.

Am I missing an alternative explanation ?

Dave,

There are some issues with the OWASP mailing list server that we are
trying to address asap.

For the time being, please delete that post about jewellery... still
we are not in that business ;-)

Message-ID: <CAE69ks7vFG66MnDB11D-YkpuExbh3owvj7yqg4iHzf_Hs9jwBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We have the great pleasure to invite you to the upcoming OWASP Dublin event
next Friday 15th June at 18:00 (registration opens at 17:30) in the TCube
at 32-34 Castle St, Dublin

Placemark to the venue here: http://goo.gl/maps/Ldcl

Please register here: https://www.regonline.com/manicode

*Workshop Details -  Secure Coding with Manico
*
Organizations cannot "firewall" or "patch" our way to secure websites. In
the past, security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
well-protected websites are occurring every day.

Today, organizations around the world rely on highly accurate, scalable and
continuous Web security services to maintain the safety of their websites
in today's hostile online environment.

Website developers must also learn to code in a secure fashion to have any
chance of providing organizations with proper defenses in the current
threat-scape. This workshop provides specific tips and guidelines to make
website code both low risk and less vulnerable.

*Guest Speaker: *Jim Manico
*Twitter:*  @manicode

Join Jim Manico, Vice President of Security Architecture at WhiteHat, as he
discusses the latest security-centric, computer programming techniques and
strategies.

Topics covered will include:

- Query Parameterization (PHP PDO) Defenses
- XSS Defense Tactics
- Cross-site Request Forgery Defenses
- and many others...

See you then,

Fabio
