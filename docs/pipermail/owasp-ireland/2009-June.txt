Hi Eoin,

The Security Testing issue of Testing Experience Magazine was published few days ago. Including various articles on Security Testing referring OWASP resources, the magazine can be accessed at the following URL:

http://www.testingexperience.com/testingexperience02_09.pdf

While I also contributed with an article on 'Testing the Enterprise Security: Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus Solutions', this  summarises some of the work I recently did in collaboration with Data Communication Security Laboratory research group (University of Limerick) on testing and improving the application security of several high-profile Anti-Spam/Anti-Virus enterprise solutions. This could also make the subject of a potential OWASP presentation within the Irish chapter.

The Testing Experience guys also plan to publish from October a new magazine on Application Security, called 'Security Acts'.

Hi Marian

This sounds very interesting. Is this magazine focusing on security or
application testing in general?



>From experience anti virus is a very useful layer in preventing an internal
attack i.e. Planting stealth software on target PC's with the aim of
obtaining domain controller credentials.

In many cases if the enterprise has  decent anti virus controls enabled the
ability for an internal attacker to proliferate malware internally with the
aim to accessing tangible data which could be used for identify theft or to
sell on the black market is reduced, the attack footprint is reduced.



Would you like to present at a chapter meeting or  at the OWASP Ireland
event in September? Send me an email offline if you wish to do so.

Do you have empirical data on your research which you can share?

Just open the link and it will test for the presence of conficker on the computer you are using. Not 100% accurate but still very good.

In response to some slagging from Eoin, I had forgotten to send the  
list the EyeChart information in early April. At IRISS, we've being  
doing some work with the Conficker Working Group (CWG)....it's just a  
pity the .ie ccTLD didn't join in.

The chart was created by a guy called Joe Stewart from Secure Works as  
part of the CWG and some further details on it can be found here -  
http://www.joestewart.org/?p=26 with the original chart here -  
http://www.joestewart.org/cfeyechart.html.

The chart was launched (to coincide with the April 1st d-day) as a  
quick, simple visual check to see if your Windows PC/laptop was  
infected by Conficker as Conficker typically blocks connections to  
popular AV vendor sites.

Hi,

OWASP special offer regarding the registration rates still applies:

Registration fee of ?90 if registered before June 30 and ?100 if registered
by August 31.!!

This includes a buffet lunch, refreshments, OWASP merchandise and the chance
to listen to some of our best local and international application security
speakers.

Additional presentation information has been added to the event Website
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference

*Digital Security: A risky business:
*In this talk Professor Angell will take the devil's advocate position,
warning that computer technology is part of the problem as well as of the
solution. The belief system at the core of computerization is positivist
and/or statistical, and that itself leads to risk. The mixture of computers
and human activity systems spawns bureaucracy and systemic risk, which can
throw up singularities that defy any positivist/statistical analysis. Using
black humour, Angell discusses the thin line between the utility of
computers and the hazard of chaotic feedback, and ends with some advice on
how to survive and prosper amongst all this complexity.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Digital_Security:_A_Risky_Business
*Organizing a Defensive Posture ? Integrating Web App Testing, Source Code
Analysis, and WAF?s*
There are many avenues an organization can take to achieve success with an
Application Security program. Ethical Hacking, Source Code Analysis, and the
utilization of a Web Application Firewall. This presentation demonstrates
and describes a method of integrating all three options for success.We will
see a real example on combining the results of runtime testing and Automated
Source Code Analysis into the larger starting point of Manual source code
verification. Finally, we will see how to apply these how a Web Application
Firewall can be used to mitigate many of the identified threats.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Organizing_a_Defensive_Posture_%E2%80%93_Integrating_Web_App_Testing%2C_Source_Code_Analysis%2C_and_WAF%E2%80%99s


*How to Avoid Flaws in the First Place: The OWASP Enterprise Security API
(ESAPI) Project*
Application security is arguably the most difficult IT challenge facing
organizations today. Chasing the 700 types of common weaknesses with
scanners and static analysis is a losing proposition. Rather than chasing
after these vulnerabilities, developers can address almost all of these
problems with a set of 10 to 12 strong centralized security controls. To
make it easier for developers to establish these controls, the Open Web
Application Security Project (OWASP) has created a clean, intuitive, and
open-source toolbox of the core security building blocks that every web
developer needs. In this talk, Dave will show you how to create an ESAPI for
your organization that will solve the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities,
increase assurance, and dramatically cut costs all at the same time.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_Avoid_Flaws_in_the_First_Place:_The_OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API_%28ESAPI%29_Project
*SQL Injection - how far does the rabbit hole go?*

SQL Injection has been around for over 10 years, and yet it is still to this
day not truly understood by many security professionals and developers. With
the recent mass attacks against sites across the world it has again come to
the fore of vulnerabilities under the spotlight, however many consider it to
only be a data access issue, or parameterized queries to be a panacea.
This talk starts from what was demonstrated last year at Black Hat in Las
Vegas, where a self propagating SQL Injection worm was demonstrated live on
stage. Explore some of the deeper, darker areas of SQL Injection, hybrid
attacks, and exploiting obscure database functionality.

More presenters to be announced very soon!!, so sign up now!

Hi everyone,

I wondered whether it was time for us to start thinking about another 
chapter meeting? I think it would be cool if we could have one every few 
months so how about sometime next month?

Hello List,

can any of you who are intending to go to the OWASP event in September (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference)
but have not registered yet ping me directly so I can estimate "Irish
chapter" numbers?

This would greatly help in budgeting for conference materials (books,
t-shits etc) and food/beer.

thanks for your help in advance,

Eoin

Hi everyone,

I wondered whether it was time for us to start thinking about another 
chapter meeting? I think it would be cool if we could have one every few 
months so how about sometime next month?

I'm proposing the week commencing 20th July if that is ok with everyone.

Any suggestions or volunteers for speakers? (or anything in particular 
you would like to see presented).

Message-ID: <4A49E522.8070802@realexpayments.com>

I have been reading through the Content Security Policy today and it 
looks like it could be a useful defence for stopping XSS, writing secure 
code is obviously the first thing you should tackle but defence in depth 
is always good. In short, the CSP allows you to whitelist domains that 
the users browsers can use as valid sources for scripts, there is of 
course a little bit more to it than that but it does look useful.

You can find out more about the Content Security Policy here:
