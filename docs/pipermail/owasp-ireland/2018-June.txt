Hi all,

OWASP Dublin are delighted to announce details of our next chapter 
meeting on 12th June in Morgan McKinley. We have Wendy Nather from Duo 
Security talking about "Denial of Trust: The New Attacks", and Tammy 
Hawkins from Mastercard talking about Selfie-pay.

Please register on EventBrite 
(https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/owasp-dublin-denial-of-trust-selfie-pay-tickets-46690535649) 
and share with colleagues or on social media. Here's some more detail. 
Hope to see you there.

*Session one*

*Wendy Nather*is Director of Advisory CISOs at Duo Security. She was 
previously the Research Director at the Retail ISAC, as well as Research 
Director of the Information Security Practice at independent analyst 
firm 451 Research. Wendy led IT security for the EMEA region of the 
investment banking division of Swiss Bank Corporation (now UBS), and 
served as CISO of the Texas Education Agency. She speaks regularly on 
topics ranging from threat intelligence to identity and access 
management, risk analysis, incident response, data security, and 
societal and privacy issues. Wendy is co-author of The Cloud Security 
Rules, and was listed as one of SC Magazine's Women in IT Security Power 
Players in
2014.

Wendys talk will focus on*?Denial of Trust: The New Attacks?*

As our software goes, so goes our society. From the biases we inject 
into algorithms, to flawed security trust models in our architecture, to 
?dark patterns? in design, to social platforms abused for propaganda, we 
are vulnerable to trust-based attacks. In order to fight these micro- 
and macro-level vulnerabilities, we need to rethink our steps all along 
the way.

*Session Two*

*TammyHawkins*, Vice President of Commercial Solutions software 
engineering at Mastercard. She worked for 7 years in enterprise security 
solutions technology organization at Mastercard prior to moving to 
Dublin, Ireland in 2016.

Tammy will speak about a new technology known as selfie pay. Tammy will 
discuss not only the feature itself but the engineering behind it.

Thanks,

OWASP Dublin Team
