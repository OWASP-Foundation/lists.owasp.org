"Virgin Media loses CD containing customer bank details

Virgin Media - the entertainment and communications arm of Richard Branson's
Virgin Group - has lost an unencrypted computer disc containing the bank
account details of 3000 UK customers.

Virgin Media discovered the CD - which also contained names and addresses of
customers - was missing on 29 May.

The breach affects customers that signed up to Virgin Media services in
Carphone Warehouse stores from January this year.

It is not known why the data was burned onto a CD - a move thought to be at
odds with the firm's policy of using secure FTP transfers.

In a statement a Virgin Media spokesperson says: "We have been working with
the Information Commissioners' Office on this matter and we are in the
process of contacting all of the affected customers to ensure we meet our
responsibilities and fully support them through this process."

Virgin Media says it is now conducting a review of its data protection
policies and practices.

In April HSBC revealed a CD containing the names, cover levels and dates of
birth of around 370,000 UK life assurance customers had gone missing.
However, this case was dwarfed by HM Revenue and Customs' loss last October
of computer discs containing the confidential information - including bank
account details - of all 25 million child benefit recipients in the UK by HM
Revenue and Customs (HMRC)."
