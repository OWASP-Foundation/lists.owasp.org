Hi Folks,
How is everyone? It?s been a bit quiet!

Anyway, might anyone have thoughts or experience on client-side ssl certs?

I am making a web app. I need some form of user authentication. I?m
thinking I need to go a bit better than just having username/password
for access control. What options are out there? It's for a
public-sector thing. My hesitation with username/password access
control is that the credentials might just get passed around.

I guess that client-side certs are the answer. But, there will be
about 2000 users. These are low-tech users, distributed  around
Ireland. On their personal (ie not standardized) browsers/operating
systems. So I can?t call around to them all doing the certificate
installs. I?m not optimistic about asking this user population to do
it themselves.

Any opinions ?
Maybe it boils down to saying that I either have to
use username/password
or, accept the large effort of generating, installing and managing the certs?
Is there a good way to generate, install and manage certs?

Thanks!
JM

How about 2 layer auth, two passwords where the second one is asked only when the first is correct? No certs but a little better than user/pswd

How about not making the credential checking your problem and instead use a
federated id?

Hi John,

Client-side SSL certs could turn out to be a bit of a nightmare.
Especially if, as you say, your user base are using a variety of
technologies.
What about doing something with mobile phones/SMS?

You are worried about credentials getting passed around. Preventing the
same user from being logged on twice from two different locations might
be a partial solution.
Training, including dire warnings about sharing credentials might help.

But as we say "it depends" on context/value of data etc....

Hi John.

For server-size strong encryption, you can use JavaScript strong encryption / RSA.  http://www.jcryption.org/. 

You can authenticate computers users are logging in by issuing a unique pubkey key and storing it in the cookies or web cache. If user is logging from new computer, you can ask for more details. On the server, then, you can maintain list of issued keys, expire them, monitor who?s using which machine and so on. (http://www.jstorage.info/)

Apart from password, use second authentication screen.

Ask username and password first, then send user to second screen. On that screen show ?unique picture? and ask to enter additional data. Either certain digits from the secret number or answer to security question. Don?t let them re-shuffle with refresh. 

Use tokens on the form, so that same form couldn?t be submitted multiple times. 
 
bruteforce delays. If password is typed incorrectly, double delay value for user. When checking again, if time < previous_attempt_time * cooldown_value, then ask user to wait. You would need to store delays even for incorrect usernames.

That?s all what comes to mind. With all this implemented, it should be darn good and usable.


Hope this was helpful.

Hi All,

Wow, thanks for all the responses.

Federated id (Peter McE). Like a single-sign-on (SSO)? The world would
be a better, more interoperable place if we had one available. I am
toying with the idea of suggesting linking with a public SSO thing.
This would basically mean letting people log in using their Facebook
or Gmail accounts. But, to quote from Father Jack, I think ?that would
be an ecumenical matter?.

As pointed out by Alexis, choice of solution depends on the context,
like the value or sensitivity of the data. In this case, the level of
sensitivity is not top-of-the-scale (further detail available
off-line).

In terms of a compromise leading to data fraudulently inserted/updated
to the system, we could rely on these fraudulent actions being
remedied later if they can be detected. I think that?s important,
because in some contexts, actions cannot be undone. Like, in an
application which (let?s say) launches missiles, it?s not great to
rely on a fraudulent missile-launch being remedied later.

Two-layer auth, A username/password, followed by a second page asking
for a second password or PIN (Eoin K and Romans M).  This might have
the psychological effect of suggesting the credentials should not be
passed around.

A likely candidate solution might be to detect if a user is logging in
from a new computer (ie Romans thing, or just plaintext persistent
browser cookie). In this case, the user would be verified with a phone
call.

>> (Alexis) What about doing something with mobile phones/SMS?
Interesting. What might this be? Like, requesting a temporary password
via SMS? (In fact, I?ve got another job going on where this might fit.
In the other project, there is a much larger user population. These
folks rarely log in, so can?t be expected to maintain a password. But
they mostly have mobile phones)

Anyway, I?m off surfing for a week in Lahinch, and will duly weigh up
these options between sessions.

thanks again, and full marks for team effort!
JM
