Hi,
This (below) may be of some interest to some of you? (Free SANS
Meeting/Seminar)
also if any of you are looking for a career as a client facing security
consultant drop me a line.
One last thing,
Does anyone wish to get more involved in OWASP Ireland chapter, I was hoping
to create a "board" of leadership so we could have more frequent meetings
and a wider range of topics?
Drop me a line on this also if you wish?

happy Monday :)

Eoin

Hi Eoin

The SANS Institute www.sans.org are running a training course in
Dublin this week and on Wednesday are hosting a free event open to
all.  I thought it may be of interest to you and others from OWASP.

Regards

Brian

As part of the SANS training taking place next week in Moran's Red
Cow Hotel a community night open to all will be held on Wednesday
night at 18:30 in the Pearse Suite in the hotel.

There will be two presentation topics;

* Network Early Warning Systems by Mike Poor
* Time-to-Live of a Website by Arrigo Triulzi

Bio of the speakers:

Mike Poor is a founder and Senior Security Analyst for the DC firm
Intelguardians LLC. In his recent past life he has worked for
Sourcefire, as a research engineer, and for the SANS Institute
leading their Intrusion Analysis Team. As a consultant, Mike conducts
forensic analysis, penetration tests, vulnerability assessments,
security audits and architecture reviews. His primary job focus
however is in intrusion detection, response, and mitigation. Mike
currently holds both GSEC and GCIA certifications and is an expert in
network engineering and systems, network and web administration. Mike
