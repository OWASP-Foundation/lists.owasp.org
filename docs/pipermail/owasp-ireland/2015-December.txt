Subject: [Owasp-ireland] OWASP December Event / Christmas Party
Message-ID: <CACH=f5azRk7tU3GqME3xUcPD67sX1nkoxOB0qFPPMzezKbVv2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


I?m happy to announce that we will be hosting our next OWASP Dublin
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland-Dublin chapter event in the Morgan
McKinley?s office on December 10 2015.



The event will be followed by our annual Christmas party in a location to
be decided. I would like to thank our sponsors Ward Solutions, Integrity
360, BCC Risk Advisory and Morgan McKinley. There will be a raffle during
the event for a Samsung Galaxy Tab.



*<TALK>Tony Clarke ? ICON PLC - Application security in a cyber security
program**</TALK>*



Data breaches such as the recent Talk Talk and Vtech breaches are regularly
reported on in the media and its clear that existing approaches to
application security are flawed and failing. This session will examine
application security in the context of a cyber security program and will
outline an approach to application security which facilitates modern
development practices and standards. The session will examine security
models, controls, processes and metrics which are required to prevent,
detect and respond to these types of breach and integrate with operational
models and compliance requirements.



*<TALK>**Will Bailey ? IBM - Drop your breaches**</TALK>*



In this talk, I'll cover how we could be doing a much better job of
improving the security of applications by educating developers better and
why the approach a lot of the current security education employs both in
the professional and academic spheres is wrong.



I'll also explain why it's a reflection on why I'm more likely to hire a
half decent coder than a security graduate these days, so if you're
currently studying and/or looking to get a a job in application security /
ethical hacking in the near future this might be your ticket!





Please register here, Due to limited spaces we will require tickets upon, 1
per person  -

Message-ID: <CABkSbXiKZOs18YXL+SSasyZ4tCaPgFwfGhd8oQy7mfv0J8xyKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

As you may (or may not ) know OWASP is a registered charity in the EU as
well as the USA.

https://www.owasp.org/images/9/90/126741_OWASP_vzw_modelstatuten_v0.9_EN_REV.pdf

As per policy we voted in a few new people to replace myself among others
on the EU Board.

I'd like to congratulate Gary Robinson from the Belfast Chapter on
successfully being voted onto the board!!

Garry is a co-lead on the OWASP code review guide and had proven to be a
valuable asset to the foundation!!

Congrats Garry, Well deserved.

Eoin

Thanks for the kind words Eoin,

With many of the discussions going on around OWASP at the minute it should
be interesting times.  If anyone has anything they'd like me to bring up to
the European board please let me know.  It's good to keep some Irish blood
in these discussions :)

Gary
