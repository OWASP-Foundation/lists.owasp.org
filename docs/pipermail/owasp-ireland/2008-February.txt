Colleagues,

This brings up a very good question for end-users:  What end-user (not
corporate) full disc encryption products are out there for protecting the
contents of a Windows laptop?  The Mac world has an excellent built-in
(FileVault) but the Windows world doesn't.  Any recommendations or
experiences to share?

If you've got Windows Vista you could use Bitlocker.

For others versions of Windows consider using PGP Whole Disk encryption.

Ron, 

 

I am currently doing research in this area, and the new(ish) BitLocker which
is available in Vista Ultimate or Enterprise will provide you with Hard
Drive Encryption.  I would say full but it does depend on the configuration
of the laptop.

 

Where multi partitions exist BitLocker can be used with EFS to provide
adequate protection.

 

But again it all depends on the nature and quantity of data that is stored
on your laptop as to the best product for you and of course cost.

 

PGPDIsk is also good, but relatively expensive.

 

There are in fact a number of other products that I have not tested.

 

Regards

 

St. John Harold

IT Security Consultant

Colleagues, 

This brings up a very good question for end-users:  What end-user (not
corporate) full disc encryption products are out there for protecting the
contents of a Windows laptop?  The Mac world has an excellent built-in
(FileVault) but the Windows world doesn't.  Any recommendations or

Hello,
The code review site now contains a link to a *very* simple beta code
rerview tool (CodeCrawler) which scans code for the API calls listed
in the code review guide ("Crawling code").

Latest TrueCrypt (5.0, released only last week - see http://truecrypt.org)
supports Linux, OS X and Windows, with whole disk encryption for the latter.

I particularly like this 'feature':

*Q: Will TrueCrypt be open-source and free forever?*

A: Yes, it will. We will never create a commercial version of TrueCrypt, as
we believe in open-source and free security software.

Great,
static code review tools just rock. "But remember a fool with a tool
is still a fool :)"
If you would like to add a chapter to the code review guide please
feel free. (under automated code review section in the wiki).

It should detail usage and setup.
Thing with open source tools in general is they can be a pain to set
up or they are unstable. People download them, spend 5 mins trying to
get it working and then delete. So a configuration guide, usage guide
and benefits so people will actaully use it!!!!
The guide shall now have two tools, one a .NET assembly (Code Crawler)
and this one (Orizon). Lets hope they can get along :)

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] [Owasp-leaders] Simple Beta code review tool

Hi guys, just a note to announce that I just released a new version of
Owasp Orizon Framework with the source code crawling APIs available
for Java and CSharp.

How can you use it?
Look at this example:
http://orizon.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/orizon/orizon_package/src/org/owasp/orizon/demo/jCrawlerDemo.java?view=markup&pathrev=269
Orizon default library contains both all the java than the csharp
dangerous keywords as listed in the Code review Guide.
In your crawling code you can extract the XML file containing the
keywords from the library and then create a JavaCrawler object using
the XML filename as contructor parameter.
As you may see, you have just to call the crawl method that returns
true if some keywords were found or false otherwise.
If crawl() method will return true, a Report object will be available
via getReport() method and full of the matching keywords.
Is it very simple isn't it?

Orizon v0.70 Jar file is available at this link:
http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=177056&sel_platform=280

I hope you can find it usefull, I'm planning to add to Owasp Orizon
framework all the checks  you guys suggested in the Code review Guide.
Eoin sorry if I was not able to write some notes about my framework
for the printing copy of the guide but I was full of work. Am I in
time for the RC3 of the guide?

I'm waiting your feedback
Thanks

If you've got Windows Vista you could use Bitlocker.

For others versions of Windows consider using PGP Whole Disk encryption.

Colleagues, 
This brings up a very good question for end-users:? What end-user (not corporate) full disc encryption products are out there for protecting the contents of a Windows laptop?? The Mac world has an excellent built-in (FileVault) but the Windows world doesn't.? Any recommendations or experiences to share?

Laptops, blackberries and usb keys being lost by the gov. Also hacking 
incidents on various state bodies.
