<PRE>Hello OWASP'ers

Just a reminder that our next OWASP Dublin chapter meeting is on the 30th
March @ Google @ 17:00

 **
 **
Address:
Google, One Grand Canal Plaza Building (located on Grand Canal Street
Upper, beside the junction of Warrington Place and Barrow Street).

with Marcus Pinto (@ mdseclabs) and Dominic Chell (@deadbeefuk) shall be
presenting.

   **
 **

 *Workshop #1 Details - Application Hacking: Beyond the OWASP Top 10
*
Whilst many guides, tools and methodologies stress the importance and
expand the ubiquity of the OWASP Top 10, many of the more interesting
vulnerabilities are those which are not. In this talk, MDSec present some
results from our assessments which defy even the broad classification of
the OWASP Top 10.

*Guest Speaker: *Marcus Pinto
*Twitter:*  @mdseclabs

With nine years&#8217; experience, Marcus Pinto is an industry thought leader in
Information Security, having authored the Web Application Hacker&#8217;s Handbook
Series, and delivered numerous private training courses, conference
training, seminars and awareness days on technical subjects worldwide.
Marcus has managed end-user security, consultancy and internal penetration
testing teams for government and financial sector organisations.

*Workshop #2 Details: iOS Application (In)Security
*
The mobile application market has exploded in the last few years. With
Apple holding a majority market share in the consumer market and a growing
foothold in the enterprise, iOS application security has never been so
important. In this talk, MDSec will present some of the lessons learned
from evaluating iOS applications covering the platform security features,
blackbox app assessment and the security relevant APIs.

*Guest Speaker: *Dominic Chell
*Twitter:*  @deadbeefuk

Dominic is a director of MDSec, a UK based security consultancy
specialising in a range of technical security assessment services including
Mobile security. As a researcher, Dominic has been publicly acknowledged by
numerous vendors, including Apple, for vulnerability disclosure.


Hope to see you all there!!!
