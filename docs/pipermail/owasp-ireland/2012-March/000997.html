<PRE>Hi Folks

Some interesting analysis of specific appsec issues identified in the Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report

Folks

Don't forget the report reflects the cases reported by those involved. It may not reflect trends not reported to the bodies involved.

In the case of IRISSCERT the majority of issues were related to misuse/abuse of login credentials. We had some cases involving SQL injection but appsec issues were in the minority when it came to our contribution to the report.

Hi Eoin,

Yep it can do but how malware was installed was included in the report as well and XSS is going to account for very few of those infections I think. According to the report 95% of all malware used in those data breaches was installed after the attacker got access to the system, at best I think only around 3% of the malware used in data breaches came from web app vulns being exploited (2% &quot;injected by attacker&quot; and 1% &quot;drive by web attacks&quot;).

It could be that the malware installed via an XSS exploit is part of the 95% but if it was a significant chunk of that I'd have expected it to be called out in the report.
I could be reading that part of the report wrong though :)

But xss leads to malware upload? It's a payload delivery system.

Hi Alexis,

I'd say your final question is correct. I'm not doubting they are big issues (in that they can be exploited and are in many web apps) but they aren't in the same league as the vectors mentioned in the report. I can't remember a big CSRF news story for example yet alone one that lead to a lot of data being stolen.

I could not find any mention of XSS (or CSRF). At least they were mentioned in last year's edition. Does this mean that the OWASP Top 10 puts too much of an emphasis on these issues? While they might be prevalent in online applications, they are not actually exploited much in actual data breaches?

Opinions welcome.

Hi Fabio,

What I found interesting is that of the vectors included in the hacking category 90% of the breaches were because of non app sec issues! I was a bit surprised by that and it is very different when the report focuses on &quot;large&quot; organisations (54%) but it does provide a strong argument for app sec v non app sec spend not being equal.

Sure app sec spend needs to increase but using the evidence presented in this report (and I acknowledge it's not the complete picture of course) it's a tough sell to convince people that app sec spend should be equal to or more than non app sec spend.

Veracode published a blog which pulled out the app sec &quot;highlights&quot;:

Hi there,



Interesting read... not surprisingly SQL injection is on top of the

list along with credentials misuse and malware.
