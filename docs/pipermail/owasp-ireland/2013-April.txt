Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Eclipse Static Analysis Plugin
Message-ID: <4A927FEA662A0749A0E12AA2E356E2565FAF5D@MBX901.realexpayments.com>

Hi,

We've been working on a plugin for Eclipse which does real time static analysis (Java only) to give our developers security feedback as they write their code. We are open sourcing the plugin (code is now on GitHub) and an Eclipse plugin site will go live this week so we are looking for people to test the plugin and give us some feedback as we've only used it internally at Realex so far.

My colleague Diarmaid has written a couple of blog posts about the plugin and recorded a couple of videos of it in action:

http://www.securityninja.co.uk/application-security/eclipse-static-analysis-plugin/

http://www.securityninja.co.uk/application-security/esp-security-plugin-source-code/

https://github.com/diarmaid-mcmanus/ESPSecurityPlugin

If you are interested in testing the plugin feel free to contact myself or my colleague Diarmaid (diarmaid.mcmanus at realexpayments.com<mailto:diarmaid.mcmanus at realexpayments.com>). Feel free to share this with other people, mailing lists etc as we think this plugin will be very useful to developers.

Dave
