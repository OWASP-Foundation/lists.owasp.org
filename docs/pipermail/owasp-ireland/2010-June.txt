1. OWASP Ireland June Event: Define Security Requirements - A practical 
approach 

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Ireland chapter meeting to be 
held on June 30th at 6:30pm-7:30pm (show up at venue between 
6:00pm-6:30pm). 

As usual our location are the Ernst & Young offices in Dublin who kindly 
agreed to host our event: 

- Ernst & Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon Pub, 
Dublin, Ireland 

Google Map location here: 

http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=harcourt+street,+dublin&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=33.160552,79.013672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Harcourt+St,+Dublin,+County+Dublin+City,+Ireland&ll=53.333417,-6.262588&spn=0.00305,0.009645&t=h&z=17 


As last time, we should have plenty of time to have a talk and a few 
drinks afterwards. 

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at 
http://owasp-ireland-june.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real 
name, as this will be given to Ernst & Young building security. If you 
don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building.   

A certificate of participation will be provided to those attending the 
event. 

== Talk == 

Title: Define Security Requirements - A practical approach 

Abstract:   

The Data Protection Act states that "appropriate security measures" must 
be taken to protect personal data. How do you specify the appropriate 
security measures for a website which processes personal data? It is an 
important step in a development project, but is often neglected. In this 
talk, Alexis will descibe his own experiences of assessing web 
application, and will also look in more detail at what the Data Protection 
Commissioner says. He will then take a fictional website and look at a 
practical approach to specifying the security requirements that the 
fictional application should meet. This will use the kind of risk-based 
techniques outlined by OWASP or the Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle 
(SDL). Issues discussed will include encryption, authentication, access 
control, audit, etc. The result will be a list of security requirements 
that can be carried into the design and development phases. Attendees 
should be able to apply the ideas to their own development projects. 

== Presenters == 

Alexis FitzGerald 

For the last six years Alexis has worked for Rits Information Security 
Group, where he performs application penetration testing assignments as 
well as advising clients on application security issues. Before that, he 
spent many years as a developer (mainly in the financial sector), and he 
continues to be involved in development. Alexis holds an MSc in 
Information Security from the University of London, Royal Holloway. 

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the 
chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland ). 

2. OWASP CSRF Tester: How to test your apps for CSRF vulnerabilities

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack whereby the victim is 
tricked into loading information from or submitting information to a web 
application for which they are currently authenticated. The problem is 
that the web application has no means of verifying the integrity of the 
request. The OWASP CSRFTester Project attempts to give developers the 
ability to test their applications for CSRF flaws. 

More info here: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_CSRFTester_Project 

3. OWASP AntiSamy: How to prevent malicious input in your apps 

The OWASP AntiSamy project is a few things. Technically, it is an API for 
ensuring user-supplied HTML/CSS is in compliance within an application's 
rules. Another way of saying that could be: It's an API that helps you 
make sure that clients don't supply malicious cargo code in the HTML they 
supply for their profile, comments, etc. that gets persisted on the 
server. The term malicious code in terms of web applications is usually 
regarded only as JavaScript. Cascading Stylesheets are only considered 
malicious when they invoke the JavaScript engine. However, there are many 
situations where "normal" HTML and CSS can be used in a malicious manner. 

More info here: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project 

4. HTML5: Security Facts developers should keep in mind 

The war on the words between Apple and Adobe Systems has prompted plenty 
of speculation about the fate of HTML5. But while HTML5 remains a work in 
progress, the one thing that is certain is developers who adopt HTML5 will 
have a new set of features to consider as part of the application security 
development life cycle.

2. OWASP AppSec Ireland 2010: Registration for event & training now OPEN

OWASP will hold its annual Ireland Application Security conference in 
Trinity College, Dublin on September 17 2010. 

The Conference will consist of one day of training sessions, followed by a 
one-day conference with 2 tracks. 
 
In 2009, we attracted a large number of delegates from across Europe, 
Middle East and the USA and expect even greater international 
representation in 2010.
 
== Call for Presentations == 

Reception of synopis of presentations is now closed and we will announce 
the conference speakers in the upcoming weeks.
 
== Registration NOW Open == 

We open registration for the conference TODAY so grab your ticket fast at 
the following URL:

http://guest.cvent.com/i.aspx?4W%2cM3%2c679c382d-35c2-4815-a399-c2c3a95ebfd7

== Training == 

We intend to hold some application security training on the 16/09/2010 the 
day prior to the event.

Title:
Secure Application Development: Writing secure code (and testing it)

Trainers: 
Eoin Keary  Senior Manager, Ernst & Young, OWASP Board Member 
Rahim Jina Senior Consultant, Ernst & Young, OWASP Ireland chapter board. 

Abstract:
Writing Secure code is the most effective method to securing your web 
applications. Writing secure code takes skill and know-how but results in 
a more stable and robust application and assists in protecting an 
organisations brand. 

Application security is not commonly a part of many computer science 
curricula today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a 
culture that includes application security as a core part of their 
software development training efforts. This intensive one-day course 
focuses on the most common web application security problems, including 
aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten (2010) and the MITRE Top 25.  The course 
will introduce and demonstrate application assessment techniques, 
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students 
really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities in their 
code. 

This training can be booked when getting a ticket to the event.

== Keynotes confirmed ==

John Viega: Executive Vice President, Perimeter E-Security 
Keynote: "Application Security in the Real World" - Considerations for 
AppSec in non-security companies. 

Professor Fred Piper: BSc, PhD (London), ARCS, DIC, CEng, CMath, FIEE, 
FIMA, BCS, CISSP, CISM.
Keynote: "The changing face of cryptography" 

Damian Gordon: Phd, School of Computing Dublin Institute of Technology
Keynote: "Hackers and Hollywood: The Implications of the Popular Media 
Representation of Computer Hacking" 

== Sponsorship Opportunities == 

OWASP is providing sponsors exclusive access to its audience in Dublin, 
Ireland through a limited number of Expo floor slots, providing a focused 
setting for potential customers. The conference is expected to draw 150 - 
200 technologists who will be looking for ways to spend their remaining 
2010 budget and planning for 2010. Financial Services, Media, 
Pharmaceuticals, Government, Healthcare, Technology, and many other 
verticals will be represented.

Companies and organizations who have confirmed already their participation 
are: Cenzic, IRISS, IISF, IIA.

3. OWASP ESAPI: NSA to perform an in-depth security review on Java ESAPI 

The NSA has offered to perform an in-depth security review of ESAPI and 
make the results available. For those who don?t have much experience with 
the NSA, a major part of their mission is defense.  In the past, they 
supported the National Computer Security Conference, created the Rainbow 
Series, and sponsored the SSE-CMM.  More recently they?ve been involved in 
SCAP and SE-Linux.
 
They have a team that is very experienced in cryptography and application 
reviews lined up already and they will be starting their work very soon.  
They are going to focus on the Java ESAPI version first, and may support 
other language versions when they?re ready ? meaning their crypto is at 
least up to the Java 2.0 level.  Their initial estimate is that the review 
will take several months to complete and I?ll keep you posted on their 
progress. 

4. Security Best Practices For Developing Windows Azure Applications 

Over the last few months, a small cross-group team within Microsoft, 
including the SDL team, has written a paper that explains how to use the 
security defenses in Windows Azure as well as how to apply practices from 
the SDL to build more secure Windows Azure solutions. 

Michael Howard states: "We wrote this paper because no matter how many 
defenses we add to Windows Azure, it is important that people building 
software or hosting services in ?The Cloud? understand that they must also 
build software with security in mind from the start."

The paper also discusses some common threat scenarios, and provides 
mitigation guidance. 

More info and the link to the paper below:

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=0ff0c25f-dc54-4f56-aae7-481e67504df6

5. Cross-Site Tracing (XST): The misunderstood vulnerability 

In January 2003 Jeremiah Grossman divulged a method to bypass the HttpOnly 
cookie restriction. He named it Cross-Site Tracing (XST), unwittingly 
starting a trend to attach "cross-site" to as many web-related 
vulnerabilities as possible.

Alas, the "XS" in XST evokes similarity to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) 
which has the consequence of leading people to mistake XST as a method for 
injecting JavaScript. (Thankfully, character encoding attacks have avoided 
the term Cross-Site Unicode, XSU.) Although XST attacks rely on browser 
scripting to exploit the vulnerability, the vulnerability is not the 
injection of JavaScript. XST is a means for accessing headers normally 
restricted from JavaScript.

Confused yet? You could find the full article here: 
http://www.deadliestwebattacks.com/2010/05/cross-site-tracing-xst-misunderstood.html

Message-ID: <4C23267E.8010803@realexpayments.com>

Hi everyone,

I've been working on creating a tool which will help people carry out 
security code reviews and I wondered if a few of the people on this 
mailing list wanted to try it out. The tool isn't fully complete yet but 
the core code review functionality is so you should be able to try that 
part out.

I'm really looking for a few people to give some feedback on the tool in 
general, find any bugs and of course try to break it ;-)

You can find more information on the tool here: 
http://www.securityninja.co.uk/the-security-ninja-code-review-tool-update

If you would like to have a play with it then drop me an email and we 
can sort something out.

Just a quick note to say thanks for all the responses! The first 10
people who contacted me should have received an email with more
information this morning, I don't need any more volunteers for now :)

Thanks!

Hi,

As some of you know I work for Ernst & Young, driving the EMEIA Attack and
Penetration group.
We are looking to expand a little over the coming months and what a better
place to look for people but on an OWASP mail list?!!!

Currently I am looking for individuals with 2-3 years experience out of
college, technical, can do a little pentesting (Application & Network), know
some code development stuff, & Understand risk. Experience in financial
services and or software development environments is a plus. You shall go
through the EY A&P boot camp once you join anyways so you need to be up for
a challenge.

Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss in more detail and in
confidence.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Information Security Consultancy Positions
Message-ID: <941a4ec26a874ff55cb50a1fbc9ff951@localhost>



It appears today is the day for information security consultancy job
postings! 

Espion are also looking for people to work in information
security consultancy positions. 

The role would be a more general
information security position (information risk, ISO27001/2, PCI-DSS, pen
testing) than just pure web app testing. 

Here's a link in to the job
spec:

[1] 

If you're interested please feel free to drop me a line or ask
around for me at tonight's OWASP meeting and I can give you more info.


Cheers, 

 Mairtin
