Subject: [Owasp-ireland] First (Major) web hacking incidents for 2008. Sign
	of the year to come?
Message-ID: <f3193c100801180616r25926d5el7cb4901a019c7456@mail.gmail.com>

So early in the year and we have a number of exploits in the
application security domain already.
Don't you just love those guys for keeping the likes of us busy ??
This is from the Web Application Security consortium (sort of like
OWASP but commercially sponsored).
We have three new very interesting web hacking incidents in just two
days as a preview into how 2008 might look

Particular note is the "Hacker Safe" site which was hacked.

WHID 2007-82, An SQL injection Mass Robot - a very massive attack (>100,000
sites) using SQL injection to add malware distributing code to web site
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2007-82.shtml

WHID 2008-02: Italian Bank's XSS Opportunity Seized by Fraudsters - Active
exploit of an XSS vulnerability for rewrite style phishing
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-02.shtml

WHID 2008-01: Information stolen from geeks.com - A data breach leaking to
information leakage in a site that has Hacker Safe certificate
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-01.shtml
