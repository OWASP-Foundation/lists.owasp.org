Project Summit Belfast Recap

OWASP had another successful project summit at AppSec Europe Belfast.
The Project Summit is a combination project working session and
program improvement session for OWASP Projects. In addition to
presenting their projects -
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/0a86f0b8bf/2fa1493792/usp=sharing  to the summit, the leaders discussed ways for their projects to
collaborate and there was a proposal from one leader to combine two
existing projects with some additional work into a new third project.
Project leaders were very excited about up coming improvements to
OWASP and Projects, including Discourse, Project Handbook changes and
gamification options that will be soon available.

In addition to focusing on programmatic changes and their projects,
leaders and other community members came together to review seven
applications for projects wishing to graduate to the next level of
project maturity.

  Chapter Leader Workshop

Before every Global AppSec Event we host a Leaders' Workshop. These
workshops serve to allow the foundation staff (and board) to hear
from Chapter and Project Leaders and to catch them up on big
occurrences in the OWASP Foundation. This year there was an unusually
large portion of the meeting dedicated to sharing information from
the Foundation.

The OWASP Staff have been analyzing the Foundation's technical debt
and engaged in deep listening activities to understand how to
prioritize our actions. This activity has led to the staff
prioritizing 4 large changes to our structure: The Website Reboot,
the AMS update, a new system for mailing lists, and a volunteer
management program. These new systems will bring more insight and
control to Project and Chapter Leaders.

The Leaders' Workshop is recapped in three blog posts: OWASP Leaders'
Workshop Pt 1: 4 Major Changes and Leader Insight and Control -
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/0a86f0b8bf/f94e5dd41d , about the 4 major updates; OWASP Code Sprint 2017 -
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/0a86f0b8bf/698288843d , answering the question about the code sprint; and Chapter Questions
from the LW, discussing the other two questions leaders brought up:
(1)Discussion on move from 2 to 4 meetings per year, (2)What does the
foundation look at when judging if an event can be charged for or
not? The final blog post is not yet up.

We have also confirmed that future Leaders' Workshops will attempt to
include the webinar platform so that Leaders who are not attending
the event can still participate in the meeting.
