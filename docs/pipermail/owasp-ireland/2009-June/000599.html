Hi Eoin,

The Security Testing issue of Testing Experience Magazine was published few days ago. Including various articles on Security Testing referring OWASP resources, the magazine can be accessed at the following URL:

<A HREF="http://www.testingexperience.com/testingexperience02_09.pdf">http://www.testingexperience.com/testingexperience02_09.pdf</A>

While I also contributed with an article on 'Testing the Enterprise Security: Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus Solutions', this  summarises some of the work I recently did in collaboration with Data Communication Security Laboratory research group (University of Limerick) on testing and improving the application security of several high-profile Anti-Spam/Anti-Virus enterprise solutions. This could also make the subject of a potential OWASP presentation within the Irish chapter.

The Testing Experience guys also plan to publish from October a new magazine on Application Security, called 'Security Acts'.

Regards,
Marian Ventuneac
