<PRE>Hi there,
At last we have a new location for chapter meetings.

Can anyone interested in attending the OWASP Ireland chapter meeting in 
mid June in Dublin drop me a line??
Agenda is:
A few presentations, 
One on webservices security from a world renowned XML security vendor.
Another on actual insider threats in the modern office, pretty cool stuff.

A call for any bright ideas anyone has that OWASP could implement.

Currently we are trying to interface with Irish universities to get an 
army of developers to code app security tools.
- anybody interested in getting involved, drop me a line or give me a 
call.

After that, a few pints?
Come along, and bring your friends, enemies and pets!

CISSP's, for every hour of attendance at an OWASP meeting counts as one 
CPE credit !!


regards,

Eoin
(OWASP-Ireland Chapter Lead)
