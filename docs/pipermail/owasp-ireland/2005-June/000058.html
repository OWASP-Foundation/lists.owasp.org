<PRE>1.
An interesting document from Watchfire (from AppScan fame) which explains 
a type of attach called HTTP Smuggling.
HTTP smuggling is in effect placing more than one HTTP request in a single 
HTTP request??!!*#
The different parsing methods of various devices on a network (Firewall 
HTTP server, Appserver) cause discrepancies which can be taken advantage 
of.

&quot;To maintain your OWASP membership one must attend at least one meeting 
every three months. This has been decided due to the lack of contribution, 
and involvement by chapter members.&quot;
If you cant attend any OWASP chapter meetings drop me a line and tell me 
why. If you don't wish to attend any OWASP chapter meetings please remove 
yourself from the list.
- In my opinion involvement with OWASP has been great. We get to define 
industry and best practice standards. Companies like SPIDynamics, TEROS, 
FoundStone, WatchFire, Security Innovation  and the FTC have adopted the 
OWASP top ten and use OWASP in their marketing media. 
If you are a security professional, active involvement in OWASP is great 
fro your CV and also other OWASP members can be used for references.
