<PRE>Invitation to the IRISS-CERT Annual Cyber Crime Conference

IRISS-CERT will hold its annual conference on the 18th of November 2010 in
the D4 Berkley Court Hotel in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4. This all day conference
will focus on providing you with an overview of the current cyber threats
facing businesses in Ireland and what you can do to help deal with those
threats. We have already lined up a number of excellent speakers such as;

. Billy Hawkes - Data Protection Commissioner . Paul Gillen - Detective
Inspector - Garda Computer Crime Unit . Billy Glynn - Team Leader
Application Support and Development Technical Services - IE Domain Registry
Ltd . Christopher Boyd - Senior Threat Researcher - Sunbelt Software .
Robert McArdle - Senior Advanced Threats Researcher - Trend Micro . Peter
Wood - CEO - First Base Technologies LLP . Keith McCabe - Communications
Executive - Realex Payments Ireland

The IRISS Annual Conference is an opportunity to not only increase your
knowledge but also to meet and network with your peers in a relaxed
environment. Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors
<A HREF="http://www.iriss.ie/iriss/sponsors.htm">http://www.iriss.ie/iriss/sponsors.htm</A> IRISS is able to host this event free
of charge to the attendees.

In parallel to the above speaking sessions Ireland's premier Cyber Security
Challenge, HackEire, will be held to identify Ireland's top cyber security
experts. HackEire will see 10 teams, up to a maximum of four people per
team, compete against each other in a controlled environment to see which
team will be the first to exploit weaknesses in a number of systems and
declare victory. The purpose of the HackEire competition is to demonstrate
how attackers could gain access to your systems and allow you to learn from
the event on how to prevent such attacks from impacting your network.

More details of the event and the HackEire challenge are available at
<A HREF="http://www.iriss.ie/iriss/iriss_conference_2010.htm">http://www.iriss.ie/iriss/iriss_conference_2010.htm</A>

To register for the event or to enter a team into the HackEire challenge
simply send an email to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-ireland">info at iriss.ie</A> stating your name, title and
organisation.
