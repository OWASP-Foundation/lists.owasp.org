Subject: [Owasp-ireland] OWASP Ireland Event: Beyond the OWASP Top 10 and
	iOS Application Insecurity
Message-ID: <CAFUMsoALYG+8sh5E_G-p9qd706ZsNUqRa4EHhgWGQAF1OVn8wg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We have the great pleasure to invite you to the upcoming OWASP Dublin event
*next Friday 30th March at 17:00* (registration opens at 16:30) in *Google
Ireland Engineering offices *at One Grand Canal Plaza Building (located on
Grand Canal Street Upper, beside the junction of Warrington Place and
Barrow Street).

You could find a placemark for the building on this map :
http://goo.gl/ZGASA

This event is free and open to EVERYONE but registration is mandatory. In
this occasion, we have two great speakers from the UK coming only to
deliver these talks.

*Workshop #1 Details - Application Hacking: Beyond the OWASP Top 10
*
Whilst many guides, tools and methodologies stress the importance and
expand the ubiquity of the OWASP Top 10, many of the more interesting
vulnerabilities are those which are not. In this talk, MDSec present some
results from our assessments which defy even the broad classification of
the OWASP Top 10.

*Guest Speaker: *Marcus Pinto
*Twitter:*  @mdseclabs

With nine years? experience, Marcus Pinto is an industry thought leader in
Information Security, having authored the Web Application Hacker?s Handbook
Series, and delivered numerous private training courses, conference
training, seminars and awareness days on technical subjects worldwide.
Marcus has managed end-user security, consultancy and internal penetration
testing teams for government and financial sector organisations.

*Workshop #2 Details: iOS Application (In)Security
*
The mobile application market has exploded in the last few years. With
Apple holding a majority market share in the consumer market and a growing
foothold in the enterprise, iOS application security has never been so
important. In this talk, MDSec will present some of the lessons learned
from evaluating iOS applications covering the platform security features,
blackbox app assessment and the security relevant APIs.

*Guest Speaker: *Dominic Chell
*Twitter:*  @deadbeefuk

Dominic is a director of MDSec, a UK based security consultancy
specialising in a range of technical security assessment services including
Mobile security. As a researcher, Dominic has been publicly acknowledged by
numerous vendors, including Apple, for vulnerability disclosure.

*Registration: *http://www.regonline.com/beyondtop10

Any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Fabio

Hi Fabio,

What I found interesting is that of the vectors included in the hacking 
category 90% of the breaches were because of non app sec issues! I was a 
bit surprised by that and it is very different when the report focuses 
on "large" organisations (54%) but it does provide a strong argument for 
app sec v non app sec spend *not *being equal.

Sure app sec spend needs to increase but using the evidence presented in 
this report (and I acknowledge it's not the complete picture of course) 
it's a tough sell to convince people that app sec spend should be equal 
to or more than non app sec spend.

Veracode published a blog which pulled out the app sec "highlights":

I could not find any mention of XSS (or CSRF). At least they were
mentioned in last year's edition. Does this mean that the OWASP Top 10
puts too much of an emphasis on these issues? While they might be
prevalent in online applications, they are not actually exploited much
in actual data breaches?

Opinions welcome.

Hi Alexis,

I'd say your final question is correct. I'm not doubting they are big 
issues (in that they can be exploited and are in many web apps) but they 
aren't in the same league as the vectors mentioned in the report. I 
can't remember a big CSRF news story for example yet alone one that lead 
to a lot of data being stolen.

But xss leads to malware upload? It's a payload delivery system.

Hi Eoin,

Yep it can do but how malware was installed was included in the report 
as well and XSS is going to account for very few of those infections I 
think. According to the report 95% of all malware used in those data 
breaches was installed after the attacker got access to the system, at 
best I think only around 3% of the malware used in data breaches came 
from web app vulns being exploited (2% "injected by attacker" and 1% 
"drive by web attacks").

It could be that the malware installed via an XSS exploit is part of the 
95% but if it was a significant chunk of that I'd have expected it to be 
called out in the report.

I could be reading that part of the report wrong though :)

Dave

Folks

Don't forget the report reflects the cases reported by those involved. It may not reflect trends not reported to the bodies involved.

In the case of IRISSCERT the majority of issues were related to misuse/abuse of login credentials. We had some cases involving SQL injection but appsec issues were in the minority when it came to our contribution to the report.

What I found interesting is that of the vectors included in the hacking category 90% of the breaches were because of non app sec issues! I was a bit surprised by that and it is very different when the report focuses on "large" organisations (54%) but it does provide a strong argument for app sec v non app sec spend not being equal.

Sure app sec spend needs to increase but using the evidence presented in this report (and I acknowledge it's not the complete picture of course) it's a tough sell to convince people that app sec spend should be equal to or more than non app sec spend.

Veracode published a blog which pulled out the app sec "highlights":

Hi David,

I'll admit i did not read the report:)

So the Verizon report pretty much says XSS is not used very much to cause
havok!!
It would be good to read other reports to see if they say similar??

So are we as security peeps barking up the wrong tree.... I think the OWASP
Top 10 is based on discovered issues as opposed to breaches if that makes
sense - The most common vulns found.

Hi Eoin,

I think your final point hits the nail on the head, after all it's not a 
report detailing the most commonly found vulns but the vectors used to 
steal data and whilst XSS could have been involved it wasn't the way the 
data was stolen if that makes sense.

I'm sure if you looked at the latest White Hat Security report for 
example it would show XSS as being a common vuln and I don't think any 
would argue against that :)

Correct,
The latest WhiteHat report has XSS as second, Information leakage as #1

Hope you are going to submit (CFP) something for OWASP Ireland 2012
(September)?
Other people on the list please get involved also......

I'd love for some developers to talk at the event discussing problems they
have with security and how can it be easier to do!!??

We have Keynotes:
Jeremiah Grossman, Michael Coates + 1 more
And a good panel to be chaired by Bryce Bolland (UBS Security CTO)

Already submitted something Eoin!

On the developers point I was recently speaking with Lorna Alamri about 
app sec conferences in general and I suggested something similar. 
Specifically my one liner on that was:

"Get developers to come and speak, get them to tell the security people 
in the audience why they find it hard to write secure code"

Someone like Niall Jordan (I'm sure he is reading these emails!) would 
be ideal for that in my opinion with the background he has - both sides 
of the table in recent times. I can send a message to our developers 
here to see if anyone fancies doing something like that as well.

I completely agree guys... we need to break that "invisible" barrier
that separates security from development.

That's why there is a strong focus in pushing secure development
activities in our chapter.

Examples of this are the talks being planned for next 30th March and
20th April (details to be finalised).

Regarding the conference, we have received several submissions so far
and the agenda is shaping up very nicely.

Looking forward to see you at an OWASP event near you.

All the best,

From fcerullo at owasp.org  Fri Mar 23 12:54:18 2012

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] And while talking about reports... here goes the
	IBM X-Force Report
Message-ID: <CAFUMsoDMnM3rhPL_Of7viOYGqxPvVp-pTK3+=z54qsXjLWLQZg@mail.gmail.com>

Here you could download the full report:

http://www.ibm.com/security/xforce

Some highlights regarding the appsec industry highlited in *red below*

According to the report, there are positive trends as it appears companies
implemented better security practices in 2011:

? *Thirty percent decline in the availability of exploit code* ? When
security vulnerabilities are disclosed, exploit code is sometimes released
that attackers can download and use to break into computers. Approximately
30 percent fewer exploits were released in 2011 than were seen on average
over the past four years. This improvement can be attributed to
architectural and procedural changes made by software developers that help
make it more difficult for attackers to successfully exploit
vulnerabilities.

? *Decrease in unpatched security vulnerabilities* ? When security
vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed, it is important that the
responsible software vendor provide a patch or fix in a timely fashion.
Some security vulnerabilities are never patched, but the percentage of
unpatched vulnerabilities has been decreasing steadily over the past few
years. In 2011 this number was down to 36 percent from 43 percent in 2010.

? *Fifty percent reduction in cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
due to improvements in software quality* - The IBM X-Force team is seeing
significant improvement in the quality of software produced by
organizations that use tools like IBM AppScan OnDemand service to analyze,
find, and fix vulnerabilities in their code.  IBM found XSS vulnerabilities
are half as likely to exist in customers' software as they were four years
ago. However, XSS vulnerabilities still appear in about 40 percent of the
applications IBM scans. This is still high for something well understood
and able to be addressed.

? *Decline in spam* ? IBM?s global spam email monitoring network has seen
about half the volume of spam email in 2011 that was seen in 2010. Some of
this decline can be attributed to the take-down of several large spam
botnets, which likely hindered spammers? ability to send emails. The IBM
X-Force team witnessed spam evolve through several generations over the
past seven years as spam filtering technology has improved and spammers
have adapted their techniques in order to successfully reach readers.

*Attackers Adapt Their Techniques in 2011
*
Even with these improvements, there has been a rise in new attack trends
and an array of significant, widely reported external network and security
breaches.  As malicious attackers become increasingly savvy, the IBM
X-Force documented increases in three key areas of attack activity:

? *Attacks targeting shell command injection vulnerabilities more than
double* - For years, SQL injection attacks against web applications have
been a popular vector for attackers of all types. SQL injection
vulnerabilities allow an attacker to manipulate the database behind a
website. As progress has been made to close those vulnerabilities ? the
number of SQL injection vulnerabilities in publicly maintained web
applications dropped by 46 percent in 2011? some attackers have now started
to target shell command injection vulnerabilities instead. These
vulnerabilities allow the attacker to execute commands directly on a web
server. Shell command injection attacks rose by two to three times over the
course of 2011. Web application developers should pay close attention to
this increasingly popular attack vector.

? *Spike in automated password guessing* ? Poor passwords and password
policies have played a role in a number of high-profile breaches during
2011. There is also a lot of automated attack activity on the Internet in
which attacks scan the net for systems with weak login passwords. IBM
observed a large spike in this sort of password guessing activity directed
at secure shell servers (SSH) in the later half of 2011.

? *Increase in phishing attacks* that impersonate social networking sites
and mail parcel services ? The volume of email attributed to phishing was
relatively small over the course of 2010 and the first half of 2011, but
phishing came back with a vengeance in the second half, reaching volumes
that haven?t been seen since 2008. Many of these emails impersonate popular
social networking sites and mail parcel services, and entice victims to
click on links to web pages that may try to infect their PCs with malware.
Some of this activity can also be attributed to advertising click fraud,
where spammers use misleading emails to drive traffic to retail websites.
Emerging Technologies Create New Avenues for Attacks
New technologies such as mobile and cloud computing continue to create
challenges for enterprise security.

? *Publicly released mobile exploits rise 19 percent in 2011* ? This year?s
IBM X-Force report focused on a number of emerging trends and best
practices to manage the growing trend of ?Bring your Own Device,? or BYOD,
in the enterprise. IBM X-Force reported a 19 percent increase over the
prior year in the number of exploits publicly released that can be used to
target mobile devices. There are many mobile devices in consumers' hands
that have unpatched vulnerabilities to publicly released exploits, creating
an opportunity for attackers. IT managers should be prepared to address
this growing risk.

? *Attacks increasingly relate to social media* - With the widespread
adoption of social media platforms and social technologies, this area has
become a target of attacker activity. IBM X-Force observed a surge in
phishing emails impersonating social media sites. More sophisticated
attackers have also taken notice. The amount of information people are
offering in social networks about their personal and professional lives has
begun to play a role in pre-attack intelligence gathering for the
infiltration of public and private sector computing networks.

? *Cloud computing presents new challenges* - Cloud computing is moving
rapidly from emerging to mainstream technology, and rapid growth is
anticipated through the end of 2013. In 2011, there were many high profile
cloud breaches affecting well-known organizations and large populations of
their customers. IT security staff should carefully consider which
workloads are sent to third-party cloud providers and what should be kept
in-house due to the sensitivity of data. Cloud security requires foresight
on the part of the customer as well as flexibility and skills on the part
of the cloud provider. The IBM X-Force report notes that the most effective
means for managing security in the cloud may be through Service Level
Agreements (SLAs) because of the limited impact that an organization can
realistically exercise over the cloud computing service. Therefore, careful
consideration should be given to ownership, access management, governance
and termination when crafting SLAs. The IBM X-Force report encourages cloud
customers to take a lifecycle view of the cloud deployment and fully
consider the impact to their overall information security posture.

Message-ID: <4F6C71EC.5010907@rits.ie>

According to:

  * https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010:

The OWASP Top 10 "presents a more concise risk focused list of the Top
10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks."
It's about risk - not just "discovered vulnerabiities"

A simple definition of risk is:
    risk= likelihood * impact

If you accept the DBIR evidence, then the likelihood of XSS must be low
(since it is not even mentioned), therefore the risk from XSS is
correspondingly low (eventhough it is commonly found)

The question then arises does the OWASP list of "Top 10 Most Critical
Web Application Security Risks" rate XSS too high?

Yes indeed. The browser is also getting pretty important in terms of protecting clients also with x-frame and CSP.

I think the OWASP Top 10 should keep reflecting risk and not most common
vuls.
This way, development groups can then use it as a basis for prioritising
their efforts.
But sources such as DBIR etc. should be used by the OWASP Top 10 team as
evidence when revising the Top 10 - to more accurately reflect actual
likelihood.

The OWASP Top 10 seems to be on a 3 year cycle 2004,2007,2010 so the
next version would be due next year 2013

This event is currently "sold out". I'm hoping someone has registered
but now can't attend?

If so, could you let me know, so I can borrow your registration /
assume your identity for the evening?

Thanks!

Thank you to Stephen Cushen, who has substituted my name for his on
the registration system, no identity theft required!

Chiming in so....
In my opinion many developers don't write secure code because they are not paid to write secure code. They are paid to write code that provides functionality to the end-users. Imagine these two different developers attending the same weekly progress meeting with the development manager:
Insecure developer turns up and says that he has completed all the functionality on the form he was assigned to build but that he just needs to tack on some security now to complete. 
Secure developer turns up and says that he has a 30% of the functionality complete but that that 30% is the most secure code in the world.
In a 'normal' company which of these two developers would have a job at the end of the month?
Code is going to get more secure when the cost to the business as a whole of writing secure code is less than or equal to the cost of writing insecure code. In some cases this cost is tangible and in others intangible.
I don't believe it is 'hard' to write secure code. I think it's hard to tack it on at the end, but not so to build in from the start. 

I agree though, it would be a nice idea for a presentation. I might look into it.

Hello OWASP'ers

Just a reminder that our next OWASP Dublin chapter meeting is on the 30th
March @ Google @ 17:00

 **
 **
Address:
Google, One Grand Canal Plaza Building (located on Grand Canal Street
Upper, beside the junction of Warrington Place and Barrow Street).

with Marcus Pinto (@ mdseclabs) and Dominic Chell (@deadbeefuk) shall be
presenting.

   **
 **

 *Workshop #1 Details - Application Hacking: Beyond the OWASP Top 10
*
Whilst many guides, tools and methodologies stress the importance and
expand the ubiquity of the OWASP Top 10, many of the more interesting
vulnerabilities are those which are not. In this talk, MDSec present some
results from our assessments which defy even the broad classification of
the OWASP Top 10.

*Guest Speaker: *Marcus Pinto
*Twitter:*  @mdseclabs

With nine years? experience, Marcus Pinto is an industry thought leader in
Information Security, having authored the Web Application Hacker?s Handbook
Series, and delivered numerous private training courses, conference
training, seminars and awareness days on technical subjects worldwide.
Marcus has managed end-user security, consultancy and internal penetration
testing teams for government and financial sector organisations.

*Workshop #2 Details: iOS Application (In)Security
*
The mobile application market has exploded in the last few years. With
Apple holding a majority market share in the consumer market and a growing
foothold in the enterprise, iOS application security has never been so
important. In this talk, MDSec will present some of the lessons learned
from evaluating iOS applications covering the platform security features,
blackbox app assessment and the security relevant APIs.

*Guest Speaker: *Dominic Chell
*Twitter:*  @deadbeefuk

Dominic is a director of MDSec, a UK based security consultancy
specialising in a range of technical security assessment services including
Mobile security. As a researcher, Dominic has been publicly acknowledged by
numerous vendors, including Apple, for vulnerability disclosure.


Hope to see you all there!!!

Hi Folks

Some interesting analysis of specific appsec issues identified in the Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report

Folks

Don't forget the report reflects the cases reported by those involved. It may not reflect trends not reported to the bodies involved.

In the case of IRISSCERT the majority of issues were related to misuse/abuse of login credentials. We had some cases involving SQL injection but appsec issues were in the minority when it came to our contribution to the report.

Hi Eoin,

Yep it can do but how malware was installed was included in the report as well and XSS is going to account for very few of those infections I think. According to the report 95% of all malware used in those data breaches was installed after the attacker got access to the system, at best I think only around 3% of the malware used in data breaches came from web app vulns being exploited (2% "injected by attacker" and 1% "drive by web attacks").

It could be that the malware installed via an XSS exploit is part of the 95% but if it was a significant chunk of that I'd have expected it to be called out in the report.
I could be reading that part of the report wrong though :)

Hi Alexis,

I'd say your final question is correct. I'm not doubting they are big issues (in that they can be exploited and are in many web apps) but they aren't in the same league as the vectors mentioned in the report. I can't remember a big CSRF news story for example yet alone one that lead to a lot of data being stolen.

Dave

I could not find any mention of XSS (or CSRF). At least they were mentioned in last year's edition. Does this mean that the OWASP Top 10 puts too much of an emphasis on these issues? While they might be prevalent in online applications, they are not actually exploited much in actual data breaches?

Opinions welcome.

Hi Fabio,

What I found interesting is that of the vectors included in the hacking category 90% of the breaches were because of non app sec issues! I was a bit surprised by that and it is very different when the report focuses on "large" organisations (54%) but it does provide a strong argument for app sec v non app sec spend not being equal.

Sure app sec spend needs to increase but using the evidence presented in this report (and I acknowledge it's not the complete picture of course) it's a tough sell to convince people that app sec spend should be equal to or more than non app sec spend.

Veracode published a blog which pulled out the app sec "highlights":

Hi there,



Interesting read... not surprisingly SQL injection is on top of the

list along with credentials misuse and malware.

I thought some of you might find our project announcement (below) interesting. If you're an iOS developer or know any iOS developers, I'd like to encourage you to check out the OWASP iGoat project. It's modeled after its namesake, WebGoat, and is intended to be a tool for iOS developers to learn about the major security pitfalls when developing on iOS.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_iGoat_Project

FYI, we released iGoat version 1.2 yesterday. The primary change over 1.1 is the addition of a new keychain exercise, contributed by a newcomer to the team, Mansi Sheth.

Thanks Mansi and Sean for pulling this together.

It's great to see some external participation on the project, of course. We'd love to see more -- any time!

Totally agree,
I saw ken demonstrate this at secappdev in Belgium a few weeks ago. It is very useful for developers to learn the most common issues in  and very easy to use.
It does not align completely with the mobile security top 10 but this adds to the richness of owasp projects as everyone ha their view.

Great job Ken and Sean.
