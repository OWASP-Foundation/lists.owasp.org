<PRE>Hi Folks

I thought you may be interested to know about the upcoming IRISSCERT Cybercrime Conference and Security (CTF) Challenge.

IRISSCERT Cyber Crime Conference
The IRISSCERT Cyber Crime Conference will be held this year on Thursday the 22nd of November 2012 in the D4Berkley Court Hotel, in Ballsbridge Dublin.  This is an all-day conference which focuses on providing attendees with an overview of the current cyber threats facing businesses in Ireland and throughout the world and what they can do to help deal with those threats.

Experts on various aspects of cybercrime and cyber security will share their thoughts and experiences with attendees.   Speakers include

&#8226; Marcus J. Ranum, Chief Security Officer of Tenable Security, Inc.
&#8226; Michael Moran, coordinator for Crimes against Children, Interpol
&#8226; Rik Ferguson - Director Security Research &amp; Communication EMEA - Trend Micro
&#8226; Neira Jones - Head of Payment Security - Barclaycard
&#8226; Eoin Keary CISSP, CISA, Chief Technology Officer, BCC Risk Advisory
&#8226; Candid Wueest, Principal Threat Researcher, Symantec
&#8226; Christopher Boyd, Senior Threat Researcher, GFI Software

The conference will be open to anyone with responsibility for securing their business information assets and is an opportunity to not only increase your knowledge but also to meet and network with your peers in a relaxed environment. There is a nominal fee of &#8364;25 per person attending to cover the costs of catering and other organisational expenses.

In parallel to the conference, IRISS also hosts Ireland's premier Cyber Security Challenge to identify Ireland's top cyber security experts who compete against each other in a controlled environment to see who will be the first to exploit weaknesses in a number of systems and declare victory. The purpose of the competition is to demonstrate how attackers could gain access to your systems and allow you to learn from the event on how to prevent such attacks from impacting your network.

Registration is now open at <A HREF="http://irisscert2012.eventbrite.ie/">http://irisscert2012.eventbrite.ie/</A>

Thanks

Brian
