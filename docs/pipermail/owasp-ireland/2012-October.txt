Hi Folks

I thought you may be interested to know about the upcoming IRISSCERT Cybercrime Conference and Security (CTF) Challenge.

IRISSCERT Cyber Crime Conference
The IRISSCERT Cyber Crime Conference will be held this year on Thursday the 22nd of November 2012 in the D4Berkley Court Hotel, in Ballsbridge Dublin.  This is an all-day conference which focuses on providing attendees with an overview of the current cyber threats facing businesses in Ireland and throughout the world and what they can do to help deal with those threats.

Experts on various aspects of cybercrime and cyber security will share their thoughts and experiences with attendees.   Speakers include

? Marcus J. Ranum, Chief Security Officer of Tenable Security, Inc.
? Michael Moran, coordinator for Crimes against Children, Interpol
? Rik Ferguson - Director Security Research & Communication EMEA - Trend Micro
? Neira Jones - Head of Payment Security - Barclaycard
? Eoin Keary CISSP, CISA, Chief Technology Officer, BCC Risk Advisory
? Candid Wueest, Principal Threat Researcher, Symantec
? Christopher Boyd, Senior Threat Researcher, GFI Software

The conference will be open to anyone with responsibility for securing their business information assets and is an opportunity to not only increase your knowledge but also to meet and network with your peers in a relaxed environment. There is a nominal fee of ?25 per person attending to cover the costs of catering and other organisational expenses.

In parallel to the conference, IRISS also hosts Ireland's premier Cyber Security Challenge to identify Ireland's top cyber security experts who compete against each other in a controlled environment to see who will be the first to exploit weaknesses in a number of systems and declare victory. The purpose of the competition is to demonstrate how attackers could gain access to your systems and allow you to learn from the event on how to prevent such attacks from impacting your network.

Registration is now open at http://irisscert2012.eventbrite.ie/

Thanks

Brian

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] OWASP Ireland Limerick Day, November 9th,

Message-ID: <CA+KBB05EfJXr9bWB6mbvmLQ=hQvauzjePScoo9cNFgtJC-7zZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

*OWASP Ireland Limerick Day* *2012* will take place at Absolute Hotel
Limerick on November 9th from 2pm to 6pm. As part of this event, the
audience will be introduced to various practical and theoretical aspects of
Application Security, including the following:


   -

   *Building Security Into Frameworks* presented by Jerry Hoff, VP of the
   Static Code Analysis Division at WhiteHat Security

   Who is doing it right. In this talk, Jerry will discuss the importance
   of security controls in mobile and web frameworks. The talk features a tour
   through a spectrum of languages and frameworks. A tip of the hat will be
   given to frameworks and security controls that demonstrably mitigate
   vulnerabilities, resulting in more secure code. A wag of the finger will be
   given to frameworks that either lack essential security controls, or
   implement them improperly. Many of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and
   their corresponding security controls will be discussed. Participants will
   walk away with a better understanding of the security libraries available
   across a wide array of popular web technologies.



   - *Building Secure Applications: SQLi Training Session* presented by
   Marian Ventuneac, Security Architect, Genworth Financial

   For developers and InfoSec professionals alike, this talk will provide a
   practical approach to identifying and preventing SQL Injection
   vulnerabilities in Web applications. Testing techniques, tools and secure
   coding best practices for Java, .NET, PHP, etc will be discussed.



   - *Unused Assets: Gaining an advantage* presented by Mark Goodwin,
   Security Engineer at Mozilla

   Web Application security flaws seem to be getting more and more
   attention yet developers have never had more tools at their disposal;
   modern browsers have many security features that are seldom used and there
   are security tools intended for developers which are almost exclusively
   used by security people. This talk discusses why this might be the case and
   looks at some things we can do to catch some security problems early and,
   in the process, help developers with security awareness.



   - *Countering jamming attacks against mobile communication* presented by
   Reiner Dojen, Lecturer, Department of Electronic and Computer
   Engineering, University of Limerick

   Satellite communications are nowadays employed in the provision of
   advanced personal communication services. However, interference with the
   radio transmission medium of satellite communications is a common threat:
   unintentional interferences occur frequently and jamming attacks can be
   achieved using low-grade technology. This talk discusses a new DoS attack
   against protocols for satellite communications, where an attacker
   interrupts the authentication phase by jamming a single message. A solution
   for  preventing this attack is also presented.



This is a free event, entry is limited to *only 50 participants*.
If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at
