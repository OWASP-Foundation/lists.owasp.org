*Upcoming webcast: Open to Trouble: The Risks of Open Source Code in
Application Development*


If you?re developing your own software and applications or having that
process outsourced, chances are good that open source code is being used.
While there are benefits from using open source code, there is also
significant downside. How does a security department manage the technical
and operational risks, regulatory/compliance issues and security and brand
concerns the use of open source code can expose an organization to? Join

and issues

Any questions, please let me know.


Thanks,

Hey Chapter,

Souds like a good event.....(and debate)....

I don't believe open source is of any higher risk than closed..... (Think
Linux, Struts, Spring)

1. There are more reviewers, users. Issues ted to be caught quicker (for
more popular projects).
2. The code can be reviewed by anyone.
3. The communities are generally larger.
4. The software foodchain is easier to track than closed source.

But there is a risk of

1. Online-line dependencies in the build process - E.g. Maven downloading
dependencies in realtime. ("cool" name is XBI - Cross build Injection).
https://www.fortify.com/downloads2/public/fortify_attacking_the_build.pdf
(from 2007)

2. Not checking check sums (MD5 may be used but is weaker day by day)

Recently (a few moths ago) I reviewed (closed) code for a client for
security (Secure code review). It was developed by a third party. I found 4
issues, all loading obfuscated code from a jar dependency (renamed
ojdbc14.jar to look like an oracle jar). One of which was a Mailer which
sent HTML form submission data to a "funny" range of email addresses. It
would not of worked as port 25, 465 etc was blocked on the firewall in this
case (phew).

See you all on the 8th for beers!!!
