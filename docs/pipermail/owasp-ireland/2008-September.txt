Hello OWASP'ers

A few announcements:

A cyber crime seminar as part of Global Security week is on next wednesday
(10/9) , see email below.

The code review guide v1.1 shall be published soon (in October I hope.) it
shall be showcased @ the NY conf on at then end of this month and
highlighted during the OWASP summit meeting in November in Portugal. I shall
have some copies for a forthcoming meeting.

Next OWASP meeting is to be scheduled. I am looking for suggestions on
what would we like to cover? I am personally suggesting to cover some more
client side attacks and also a taxonomy of an internal breach in an
enterprise network?
Looking at some tools, hybrid attacks using N/W and AppSec vulnerabilities
and Vulnerability linkage.

Any other suggestions, don't be shy.

regards,

ek

Hi Eoin

I am running a free conference on Cyber Crime next Wednesday the 10th at
14:00 at Jury's Doyle hotel Croke Park as part of Global Security Week.

I will have members of the Computer Crime Unit in the Gardai and a number of
industry experts speaking on how companies and individuals can best protect
themselves from cyber crime.

The seminar is free and there will be no selling at it.  I thought it might
be something that would be of interest to OWASP Ireland and would appreciate
it if you could spread the word.

Anyone needing more information can contact me or look at
http://globalsecurityweek.blogspot.com/2008/08/cyber-crime-conference-in-dub
lin.html

Hi,

Below is a link to the WSAC (Web Application Security Consortium) web
security statistics.

It gives the reader a good snapshot of the most common vulnerabilities and
the frequency one could expect to find such.

A new version of (IN)Secure Magazine was published yesterday. This is a
bit of a shameless plug by myself because I have written an article
(page 62) on secure web application development in this issue.

Any feedback is welcomed.

Nice one David,

Also there is ton of cheap training (including a secure code review 1 day
course).

Next chapter meeting:

not much response on my last mail. We've had some enquiries regarding the
next one.
What do we want to cover and when do we want to do it?

I think it would be good to maybe have a chapter meeting after the EU
Summit, disseminate the outcome of the working groups/presentations to
the chapter. I plan on coming to Portugal and I agree that it should be
good.

Some kind of technical presentation alongside that would be good.

Thanks,

Dave

A topic that I suspect maybe more relevant in the future will be the
security implications of new technologies such as Google Gears and the
various browser implementations of HTML 5 with respect to local datastores.
Perhaps something on this topic?

Message-ID: <48E1DC6A.6030707@realexpayments.com>

Hi all,

Interesting news story here:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/30/web_bug_bites_sites/ thats
details how researchers from Princeton University found CSRF flaws in 4
websites including ING's bank website. The whitepaper that is linked in
the article is a good read and explains CSRF flaws and preventions very
well.

Finally the example many people use (transferring funds from an online
bank using CSRF) to highlight the dangers of CSRF has become a reality.

Thanks,

Dave
