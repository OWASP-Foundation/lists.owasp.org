A number of top financial companies and banks such as Wells Fargo & Co., 
Bank of America Corp. and USAA are rushing out updates to fix security 
flaws in wireless banking applications that could allow a computer 
criminal to obtain sensitive data like usernames, passwords and financial 
information.

The central problem is that the apps, which run on Apple Inc.'s iPhone and 
Android-based devices from Google Inc., are storing a user's information 
in the memory of a cellphone, a basic lapse that the security researcher 
who found the flaws said could allow a cybercriminal to access a person's 
financial accounts.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Building WebGoat with Rational Application
 Developer for Source Code Analysis test
Message-ID: <BLU154-w108DCE554E6DAC5113E8F7BD4F0@phx.gbl>


Hello,

I am helping out on a project to evaluate some source code analysis tools for my employer.  We have a couple of in-house developed apps (both .NET and Java) and will of course test those with the SCA tools.  We'll be using IDE plugins for both Visual Studio 2008 and Rational Application Developer to scan the code.  For completeness I'd like to see how well the tools cope with a few open source tools - i.e. HackMe Bank and WebGoat.  

Everything is fine with HackMe Bank (I come from a .NET background), but it's WebGoat that is presenting a challenge to me.  My employer uses Rational Application Developer (v 7.5.4) as opposed to Eclipse - which is used by WebGoat.  

Is it possible to import the WebGoat code into Rational Application Developer?  Since I only want to build the source code so that it can be scanned with the SCA tools, do I still need Maven and Tomcat?  In other words, I don't require the ability to run the built app - the SCA tools I'm looking at only require the source code to be 'build quality'. 

If anybody has any recommendations on OpenSource Java apps that work easily with Rational Application Developer, please let me know.

I appreciate any and all advice.

Best regards,

Leo

Come on, what's in the article really ?

Correct me if I'm wrong but if phones are giving away the content of their memory when a malicious website is visited, then I'd first question the security of the phone instead of bragging about discovering big names' flaws (not that I like them).

Storing clear text passwords is definitely odd, but one would investigate the exploitability of those things to assess a potential risk, isn't it ?

Rgds,
Laurent.

Laurent,

Nowadays the rush to develop applications for mobile platforms like iPhone
and Android is causing many, otherwise security-conscious firms to give
little importance to testing and quality assurance.

Also, you could define during design and development to store sensitive
information in an encrypted format instead of clear text. So if someone gets
their hands at your phone, at least that information will be protected.

Fabio

Yesterday, at the Web 2.0 Summit, Google?s CEO Eric Schmidt presented the 
Nexus S. This wasn?t just about a new phone, he also talked about how 
Gingerbread (Android OS Version 2.3) would have support for NFC (Near 
Field Communications) built in. In light of the mobile-phone hotel-key 
(NFC-based) trial going on at the Clarion hotel in Sweden and questions 
raised during the conversation at the Summit, it?s time to take another 
look at the state of NFC security.
