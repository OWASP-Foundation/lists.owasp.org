Hi folks,
I was considering holding another security class which shall be free to all....

It will not be strictly OWASP as id like to involve IISF, ISC2, ISACA folks too...

We could cover the following items which were not covered last time?

CSRF
Crypto
Authentication
Authorisation
SDLC
Mobile Sec
Testing Tools and techniques;
Possibly some security shepherd if Mark and Sean wish to take part in the class?
Zap/Burp
Possibly for Network security stuff also for fun?

If there are any takers let me know directly.
If there is interest I'll look for a venue and let you know the dates. I'm looking at October sometime to give us time to prepare.

Yes/No?

Hi Rahim,

Thanks for your mail.

I believe that this matter is being discussed at a global board level. As
of now the OWASP speaker agreement (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement) still applies.

Thanks
Owen

Hey Jim,

I have to call you out on "But you gave a talk that by your own admission
was trying to benefit Riot Games and sell games" < I don't believe I've
ever said that. We produce a free to play game dude, we don't sell games :)

Rahim, David and others,

I hope you are well. The current speaker agreement allows for a bio slide up front where you can mention your commercial connections, logo as well. 

The rest of the presentation needs to be non-commercial, per the current speaker agreement. I like that policy personally since it's in tune with out bylaws and mission statement around vendor neutrality. 99.99% that speaker agreement is honored with no fuss.

And to be honest, especially at the chapter level, the foundation does not strongly enforce this. There are presentations that do not fit this policy that slip through. And in fact there are even some chapters that encourage commercial talks.

But keep in mind OWASP is an educational charity, with a mission to be free of commercial affiliations. I think that honoring the wishes of the current speaker agreement is a ethical standard that speakers should seriously consider.

And really, if there is a chapter arguing about footers and headers - geesh we have better things to do. I am sorry it has all degenerated down to this and I wish there was a better way. 

To the persons trying to hold up a better ethical standard, thank you! To those who will not spend the 10 seconds to turn off commercial footers and are making commercial footers an issue that requires board level attention, I ask, what are
you trying to accomplish when you give a talk at our vendor-neutral primarily open source charity?

And by the way, I was dragged into this over social media and forced to make a decision.

So be it.

David Rook I love you and your talk was VERY well received. I consider you a friend. But you gave a talk that by your own admission was trying to benefit Riot Games and sell games. Per our current speaker guidelines this is not acceptable. I know how smart you are, Rook, and I'd personally prefer (but not enforce) that you give talks more suited to a non profit educational charity. I have seen literally hundreds of speakers at OWASP chapters and conferences with tight commercial affiliations still find a way to give vendor neutral non commercial tech talks at OWASP events. It CAN be done if you have the will to do it. And I hope you do! :)

With respect,

Specifically I said "I've got nothing to sell, only ideas to share" in our
last exchange so I'd like to figure out where you got that from dude.

I stand corrected. But Riot is still a large commercial company and to say it's a "free game" is only part of the story. ;)  I know I've spent real money on it myself (league of legends) on several occasions and the professional circuit is a huge financial endeavor for many. It's also closed source....

I think we should be prioritizing talks on more open source creative commons content vs commercial content. ?I've seen hundreds of speakers do this without issue?. It's very rare where commercial talks are an issue.

Again, I'm not suggesting strict enforcement but I can understand why a commercial talk, even one about a gaming company, triggered questions about our speaker policy.

My preference when asked to vote on these things is to aim more in the direction of non-commercial, vendor neutral and I am a fan of our current policy.

I do not mean this in a disrespectful way. But this is my opinion which is reflected in my 1 of 7 board votes. This is not my decree, it was discussed by many, written and reviewed by many, and voted on by previous boards. I've also seen many speakers do this without fuss, so I know it's possible regardless of your job.

With respect,
