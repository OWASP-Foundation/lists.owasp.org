Complimentary Webcast:

PCI DSS 6.6 - >
The Newest PCI Requirement




*Application Security
*

There's a new PCI standard coming. PCI DSS 6.6 requires all merchants,
banks, card processors and service providers to implement EITHER an
application firewall OR a third party code review to protect all web
applications that collect, store or otherwise handle credit card data.

However, new research from the PCI Knowledge Base makes it clear that these
two controls are NOT viewed as interchangeable, and many merchants and banks
plan to implement both, or have already done so.

Join us for a Webinar where you will learn WHAT YOUR PEERS ARE DOING to
protect their Web Applications, and how Web Application Firewalls and Web
Applications Source Code Analysis provide different, and complimentary
controls. Learn why there are VIRTUALLY NO COMPENSATING CONTROLS for these
technologies, unlike other areas of the PCI security standards.

*In only 45 minutes, you will learn:*

   - What "PCI Leaders" are doing to protect their Web Applications
   - What PCI Source Code Analysis tools do, and how they ensure that code
   is secure
   - What Web Application Firewalls do, and how they reduce security
   vulnerabilities
   - How Web Application Firewalls and Source Code Analysis are
   COMPLIMENTARY.
