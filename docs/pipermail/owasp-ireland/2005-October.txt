Hi,
 One thing that really bugs me about the new chip and pin system is way in
which the pin is entered. Some of the terminals such as those in
supermarkets offer little in the way of privacy when inputting the pin. Up
to now pins have been mostly used at ATM's where your body is a good
physical screen, but now usually the terminal is between you and the
retailer, more often than not in plain view of other cusomers too. 
A step back for pin security???

Hi,
also you can not dispute the transaction with the card company if the PIN
has been input correctly, when the signature is used, it can subsequently be
checked and if it is not a reasonable match, refuted.   In this case the
merchant has to refund the card company, and they the user....from bitter
experience!  P

More "chip and spin" methinks...

As covered in the presentation, chip & pin address Card Present
transactions, not Card Not present transactions. (Though there is some
work/pilots underway that address CNP transactions with the aid of an
additional "box" that the user plugs their chip and pin card into to buy
their goods online or whatever.)

So as the article reports, fraud has reduced 29% for CP transactions.
However... if we look at the bigger picture then it tells a different story.

 

Some key statements from the article:

"However, the figures are incomplete as they do not include card fraud over
the telephone or internet." i.e. CNP. 

In addition, the figures do not include fraud committed when cards go
missing in the post. " 

Those missing figures (from the same APACS report) are as follows:

*          "CNP fraud continues to be the biggest fraud type, rising 24%
last year to GBP150.8m approx 30% of total card fraud."

*          "Fraud on cards stolen before the genuine cardholders receive
them grew sharply - up 62% to GBP 72.9m - as criminals took advantage of the
unusually high number of cards sent out due to the rollout of new chip and
pin cards": 280,000 cards sent per day at peak.

Here's another site for your bookmarks!

The goal of the "Build Security In" project is to "alter the way that software is developed so it is less vulnerable to attack and security is "built in" from the start ". It is sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security and the aim seems to be to make it pretty comprehensive, covering topics from risk management through to testing plus training and awareness. Having said that, a lot of the internal links are still empty.

What a great site!!

Funny there are no references to OWASP seen as other Government bodies 
(FTC) and some large corporations endorse OWASP (VISA was the latest in 
its PCI standard).
Its a little bit too focused on C at the minute but that shall change over 
time. 
Most web apps are not written in C (thank god).
The main contributors are also the usual suspects, Garry McGraw et al 
which is not so fresh IMHO.

Message-ID: <BBB9FA5E1514D511A88D00B0D0AA8EA60BC597AC@ntdub1e.trintech.com>

Hi Tony,

 

In general, the requirements for the "privacy shield" for pin entry devices
were relaxed since PCI PED superseded Visa's VisaPED specs. 

Germany, having the most stringent PED security requirements in
Europe/worldwide, has not relaxed their requirements.

 

AFAIK, this relaxation is partly related to accessibility and disability
requirements/specifications.

 

PCI PED and VisaPED specify things like the minimum angle from the '5' key
(5 being the middle key on the keypad) to the top of the wall of the privacy
shield above and to the sides of the '5' key.

 

For handheld terminals, the requirements for the privacy shield are also
relaxed - the rationale being that the user can use their body as a shield
when they are holding the terminal.

 

See VisaPED section 3.4 Privacy Shield Requirement:
http://international.visa.com/fb/vendors/pin/Visa_PED_Program_Guide.pdf
<http://international.visa.com/fb/vendors/pin/Visa_PED_Program_Guide.pdf>
for more info.

Hi,

 One thing that really bugs me about the new chip and pin system is way in
which the pin is entered. Some of the terminals such as those in
supermarkets offer little in the way of privacy when inputting the pin. Up
to now pins have been mostly used at ATM's where your body is a good
physical screen, but now usually the terminal is between you and the
retailer, more often than not in plain view of other cusomers too. 

A step back for pin security???

I'd disagree with the idea of asking staff about pin observations. This
actively encourages staff to attempt to observe pins even though this is not
the intent - giving license/excuse to malicious staff to do so.

 

Also, take the example:

A staff member, Alice, reports that they've observed more pins than other
staff.

Another staff member Mallory, happens to have observed lots of pins,
including one for a card a customer left behind. Mallory reports having seen
no/low pins but commits fraud with the card and pin.

Simple example, but in this case Alice, pin observer extraordinaire, would
look more guilty than Mallory.

 

A better approach would be for the staff to actively warn/encourage the
customer to block their pin when entering it and then look away for this
part of the transaction. 

Some terminals take this approach by displaying a prompt before pin entry
that does this.

 

This approach would be a preventative rather than detective measure.

 

I think with proper education this 25% figure could be significantly
reduced.

 

Chris

At the point of "shoulder surfing" it would be up to the supermarket 
staff, the cashier, to assure the security of the company.
I don't think this will ever happen for obvious reasons.

Interesting in this case was the fact that each customer was given a card from which they could scratch off their OTP.  Users were duped into entering their latest OTP into a fake site.  So another weak link here is that the passwords were pregenerated and had no expiration.

All,

I think there is the making of another event on authentication similar
to the one that was done on centralised logging. Is anyone interested in
looking at this?

Phishing attacks have really put username/password under pressure. The
banks and similar businesses are looking at increasing the level of
authentication strength. Technologies such as tokens, smartcards and
certificates certainly deliver strong authentication but the service
providers balk at the cost, the complexity of managing the registration
and distribution of tokens (or whatever it is that you have). A key
requirement of suppliers of consumer service is that they are easy to
use - it is no use putting in strong authentication if no one uses the
service.

There are new approaches available now, like the scratch card mechanism
referred to by Eoin, or Entrust's
http://www.entrust.com/identityguard/index.htm and technologies based on
mobile phones.

I don't want to speak for the banks but their problem is not from the
losses that they are suffering due to phishing but from the low growth
of users of their online service. Research has shown that the take up of
Internet banking has stagnated and there is evidence that this is due to
the lack of confidence that potential consumers have in the service. I
wouldn't like this event to be limited to banking; the issues apply to
any business that offers an online service that could be the target of
fraud.

I thought that an event similar to a debate where a number of people
take the position of one type of technology might be a good way of
getting to the issues. No one technology is going to fit every
application but this approach might be good at flushing out the pros and
cons.

I realise this email could constitute an offer to help organise this,
but I am sure that following the excellent job that Cormac did with the
logging event that he might take this one too? :-)

Interesting in this case was the fact that each customer was given a
card from which they could scratch off their OTP.  Users were duped into
entering their latest OTP into a fake site.  So another weak link here
is that the passwords were pregenerated and had no expiration.

Message-ID: <BAY18-F199A327DA2A17571BCA34BA67E0@phx.gbl>

Hi Guys/Gals
Would one think that one of the issues with the lack of "Take-up" in online 
banking is that banks do not accept any liability for loss when using the 
online banking system, passing the liability to the consumer?
Hence to protect our own information we have to rely on the banks security 
infrastructure in some cases and who is to say that the bank are doing 
things correctly?
We just take is as granted.

This is ala "Chip & Pin" regarding the pass onof liability to the consumer?

Eoin

Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] Phishing One-time passwords
Message-ID: <BBB9FA5E1514D511A88D00B0D0AA8EA60BC597D9@ntdub1e.trintech.com>

Ross Anderson (author of an excellent book called Security Engineering) has
an interesting/relevant paper on the subject of liability:

Liability and Computer Security: Nine Principles
http://www.ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/users/rja14/liability.pdf

Abstract: "The conventional wisdom is that security priorities should be
set by risk analysis. However, reality is subtly different: many computer
security systems are at least as much about shedding liability as about
minimising risk. Banks use computer security mechanisms to transfer
liability to their customers; companies use them to transfer liability to
their insurers, or (via the public prosecutor) to the taxpayer; and they
are also used to shift the blame to other departments ("we did everything
that GCHQ/the internal auditors told us to"). We derive nine principles
which might help designers avoid the most common pitfalls."


Ross and his colleagues have been involved in various projects, with some of
these in the banking sector, exposing security vulnerabilities in ATM pin
encryption algorithms, smartcards etc... They've also acted as expert
witnesses in court cases where banks attempted to shift liability to
customers.
