Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Pen Testing Oracle Forms App
Message-ID: <DUB115-W14053ED09116C4B96F099CABD370@phx.gbl>

Hello Folks,

I've been asked to take a look at pen testing an Oracle Forms app.  Bit of a departure from the usual web apps/services/mobile gig.  Does anybody have any advice about getting Oracle Forms to play ball with Burp (or ZAP)?  It's running inside a web browser - and utilizes 'Oracle Fusion Middleware Forms Services'.  Given that modifying my browser proxy settings doesn't seem to work, I'm thinking about modifying my local hosts file to funnel traffic to Burp.  Has anybody done that for an Oracle Forms app?

Also, if there is any specific 'gotchas' I need to be aware of when looking at Oracle forms, I'd be interested to learn from anybody who has been there and bought the t-shirt! :-)  I've had a really quick look on Google and there doesn't seem to be a great deal of stuff out there.

Any and all recommendations would be much appreciated!

Thanks,

Leo

What issues are you having with Burp/Zap? I've tested oracle forms using both tools.

Depending on how it's setup, try setting the proxy in the Java control panel.

Although enterprise risk management and IT security have become mature
disciplines, and professional tools exist to detect a wide variety of
vulnerabilities in IT systems and infrastructure, their use in the support
of management decisions related to security investments is still very
limited. This is due to the fact that the findings of these tools are
presented in a very technical way, only fully understandable to experts. In
most cases, it is unclear how these technical vulnerabilities will impact
the business.

By incorporating the findings of so-called penetration tests of computer
devices and networks into an enterprise architecture model of the
organization, it becomes possible to analyze and visualize the impact that
the technical risks have on the business processes. Also, an enterprise
architecture model can also help to focus penetration tests on the IT
infrastructure that supports the most critical business processes, thus
making the tests more efficient and effective.

This webinar will initially look at the work being carried out in the
Architecture and ArchiMate? Forums, both Forums of The Open Group, around
risk and security modeling. We will then go on to present a method for
business impact analysis of technical risks, which combines the disciplines
of technical risk analysis and enterprise architecture. Our method is
supported by software tooling to (semi-) automatically import results of a
penetration test into an enterprise architecture model, and to analyze and
visualize the business impact of these technical risks. This both enhances
the value of penetration testing and increases the return-on-investment of
the enterprise architecture effort.

We will illustrate our method by applying it to a realistic case study an
end with an interactive Q&A session.

The OWASP Dublin team


*Abstract:*

Every year the security community produces a stunning number of new Web
hacking techniques that are published in various white papers, blog posts,
magazine articles, mailing list emails, conference presentations, etc.
Within the thousands of pages are the latest ways to attack websites, Web
browsers, Web proxies, and their mobile platform equivalents. Beyond
individual vulnerabilities with CVE numbers or system compromises, we are
solely focused on new and creative methods of Web-based attack. Now in its
eighth year, the Top 10 Web Hacking Techniques list encourages information
sharing, provides a centralized knowledge base, and recognizes researchers
who contribute excellent work.

In this talk, We will do a technical deep dive and take you through the Top
10 Web Hacks of 2013 as picked by an expert panel of judges.

This year?s winners are:

1 - Mario Heiderich ? Mutation XSS
2 - Angelo Prado, Neal Harris, Yoel Gluck ? BREACH
3 - Pixel Perfect Timing Attacks with HTML5
4 - Lucky 13 Attack
5 - Weaknesses in RC4
6 - Timur Yunusov and Alexey Osipov ? XML Out of Band Data Retrieval
7 - Million Browser Botnet
8 - Large Scale Detection of DOM based XSS
9 - Tor Hidden-Service Passive De-Cloaking
10 - HTML5 Hard Disk Filler? API

Good afternoon,

I am delighted to announce that Owen Pendlebury is taking over as chapter
lead for the OWASP Dublin chapter. He joined the board last year and has
been a great support since then and I have no doubt he will do a fantastic
job in keeping the chapter running and growing.

Myself and Darren have moved to Cork and are hoping to start a chapter down
here so watch this space for news on that. We will continue to support the
Dublin chapter in the mean time. Eoin and Fabio are remaining on the
chapter board.

Don't forget we have a chapter meeting this evening if you would like to
offer Owen your congratulations in person and celebrate with him.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Apple Devices hacked by Oleg Pliss.. what to do
	next?
Message-ID: <CAE69ks7LhvU8w3ecf8Os5MV6E7D+XvrU-KDKWx78swcpC+GLuw@mail.gmail.com>

A number of Australian/US/UK iPad and iPhone users are experiencing some
issues with their Apple devices. A message, saying something like this is
popping up on their screens:

[image: Oleg Pliss Attack]

Device hacked by Oleg Pliss. For unlock device...

In order to unlock the device Mr Pliss is asking for the modest sum of
$100/?50 Now.. although the mechanism used to hack these accounts is still
unclear, it seems the attackers got hold of the victims' iCloud login
credentials and locked their devices remotely. It is speculated that the
attackers got hold of these credentials from another data breach and just
guessed that Apple users would use the same information.

*Steps to protect yourself (if you haven't been hacked)*

1)      Enable 2FA (2-factor authentication) *right now* for your iCloud
account. This will prevent someone holding your iCloud login details to
access it. Instructions on how enable 2FA can be found on Apple's support
site: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5570

2)      Change your iCloud password as a preventive measure, especially if
you are using the same password for different sites. Instructions on how to
do this can be found on Apple?s support site:
http://support.apple.com/kb/PH2617

*Steps to take (if you have been hacked)*

1)      If the attackers have set a passcode on your device, instructions
on how to bypass the lock can be found on Apple's support site:
http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1212 However, this requires resetting the
device, which would erase all information that is not backed up.

2)      In case you cannot recover control of your device, you might need
to contact Apple?s support customer care. Here are the phone numbers:
http://support.apple.com/kb/he57

Last but not least, don?t pay the ransom as it's your device and you have
every right to own it!


Regards,

Fabio

I've seen samples of phishing emails alleging that "Your Apple ID has been
Disabled for Security Reasons!" ans pointing to the site in Australia.
Could be the answer to the question "how attackers got hold of these
credentials"...
