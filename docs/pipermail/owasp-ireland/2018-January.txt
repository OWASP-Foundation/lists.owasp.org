Hi Everyone,

Happy New Year! The OWASP Dublin team is working on a number of exciting
meetings & events which we'll share in the coming weeks.

For our next event OWASP Dublin has teamed up with ISACA Ireland to
organise for a meeting dedicated to Healthcare Cybersecurity.

We?re delighted to have David McGlade from Kainos speaking about his
experiences using machine learning to detect cyber-attacks on Electronic
Medical Records (EMR) systems which hold 33 million records and Anita
Finnegan from Nova Leah speaking about medical device cybersecurity.

Please register at:

Hope to see you there.

Thanks,

Tony
