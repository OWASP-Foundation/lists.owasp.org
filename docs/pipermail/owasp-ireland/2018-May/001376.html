<PRE>Hi all,

A couple of updates today, and a few thank yous too.

*# Chapter Meeting on 12 June*
Our next chapter meeting will be on 12 June at 6:30pm, so please save the
date. We are delighted to announce that Wendy Nather from Duo Security is
visiting from the US. Wendy has over 30 years of experience in IT and
security so it promises to be an interesting evening. We're still
finalising the arrangements and will have more details shortly.

*# Application Security Workshop in August*
EdgeScan have kindly agreed to provide a free half day workshop in the
middle of August. Topics include the following and we'll be in touch with
registration information.
* Popping machines - OSCP approach
* Secure application Development - fundamentals
* 2018 Vulnerability stats - a look back and forward at 2017/2018
vulnerability statistics

*# Recent Meetings*
We've had some very successful meetings recently and we wanted to say
thanks to all the speakers, sponsors, and everyone who helped to make these
a success. We're only able to do this with a lot of voluntary involvement
so we appreciate your help. So a shout out to:
- Workday/Myriam Leggieri, Loic Rivron (Workday), Eoin Hinchy (Tines.io)
- Tenable/Fergus Cooney, Rupert Bowen and Lee Tobin (UCD), Colm Stapleton
and Enda Farrell (NCSC), Fergus Cooney (Tenable)

*# Coder Dojo Coolest Projects*
Last Saturday a group from the Dublin chapter attended the Coder Dojo
Coolest Projects event in the RDS. We had a stand where we spoke about
security, with some tips on how kids can stay safe online, and a
demonstration of wifi hacking. We had a really great day, with lots of
interesting conversation, some inspiring kids and a good chance to get the
OWASP message to a wider audience. It's quite an effort to pull everything
together for these public events, so thanks to all who put in so much time
and effort:
- Alain Abou Tass, Abhishek Borkar, Abhishek Bhate, Claudio Marcial Peon,
Lei Shao, Martin Mitchell.
- A special thanks to Denise Murtagh-Dunne for her tireless work behind the
scenes, and to Angela for the impressive illustrations and selfie frame
that brought an extra spark to the stand.

See you soon,

Brendan and the OWASP Dublin team
