<PRE>Hi,

A quick update on some of the activities in OWASP Dublin over the coming 
weeks:

*## May OWASP Event on Thursday 10th May*

We are delighted to provide further details of our next OWASP Dublin 
event which is co-hosted with IISF, and kindly sponsored by Tenable.

* Colm Stapleton from the National Cyber Security Centre will talk about 
NCSC services including threat intelligence sharing and incident response.

* Fergus Cooney from Tenable will talk about DNS &amp; Web App Security, how 
it can be (ab)used by both blue and red security teams.

Please register at 
<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/owasp-dublin-and-iisf-ncsc-and-dns-tickets-45642383598">https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/owasp-dublin-and-iisf-ncsc-and-dns-tickets-45642383598</A> 
and feel free to share within your network.

*## Coder Dojo Coolest Projects - Volunteers Needed*

Coder Dojo Coolest Projects is taking place in the RDS on Saturday 26th 
May, and OWASP Dublin will be hosting a stand to talk about security. 
Coder Dojo started in Ireland and is now a worldwide initiative that 
inspires, showcases, and promotes the creativity, innovative thinking, 
technological skills, and entrepreneurship of young coders aged 7&#8211;17. 
_We need your help to get set up for this event and to talk to some of 
the 15,000 attendees on the day. If you can help, please drop an email 
to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-ireland">brendan.gormley at owasp.org</A> or <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-ireland">denise.murtaghdunne at owasp.org._</A> You 
don't have to commit to the whole day, and any assistance is welcome.

In particular we would like to hear from you if you can assist graphic 
design for the stand and awareness material for visitors. We plan to 
have to interactive demos to talk about online safety and a technical 
demonstration of how security can be compromised.

*## April Event - Thanks*

A big thanks to everyone who joined us for the April event this week. We 
hope you enjoyed the talks, and would love to get your feedback 
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NG8LKRV">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NG8LKRV</A>&gt;. Special thanks to the speakers 
Eoin and Loic for their great talks, and to Workday for hosting and 
providing pizza and beer.

Thanks,

Brendan and the OWASP Dublin team
