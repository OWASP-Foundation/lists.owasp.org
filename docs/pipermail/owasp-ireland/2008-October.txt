Message-ID: <f3193c100810130801v22fc8addieafa39e3e87e0a62@mail.gmail.com>

Attached are links relating to a potentially massive breach in the World
bank.

"While it remains unclear how much data has been pilfered from the bank,
it's a lot. According to internal memos, "a minimum of 18 servers have been
compromised," including some of the bank's most sensitive systems ? ranging
from the bank's security and password server to a Human Resources server
"that contains scanned images of staff documents."

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Information Security Maturity Models
Message-ID: <48F487CB.8060700@realexpayments.com>

Hi all,

I'm researching the many Information Security Maturity Models available
to see which one will be best for my organisation. I'm favouring the
ISM3 approach at the moment because it appears to link to COBIT very well.

Have any of you guys got experience with Security Maturity Models that
you would recommend?

Dave

*Press Release: OWASP teams up with browser developers to increase security
on the web**
Algarve/Portugal - November 4-7 2008*

*OWASP invites web browser developers to take part in its Summit in Portugal
*

OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project, is teaming up with browser
development teams to increase the security of the World Wide Web. All
popular browser teams (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Chrome)
have been invited to take a seat at the OWASP European Summit, which will
take place in Portugal in November (see
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Working_Session_-_Browser_Security_Lettersfor
OWASP's
*"Open Letter to Browsers"*).

The Summit will host the Intrinsic Security Working Group workshop on
Browser Security, to gather security experts and browser security
teams/developers together in order to facilitate introducing more and more
usable security into the browsers that all our customers use and the
specifications and standards that we rely on.

The Workshop on Browser Security aims to produce a browser security wish
list and a list of topics on HTML and browser security to be brought to the
World Wide Web Consortium: *
