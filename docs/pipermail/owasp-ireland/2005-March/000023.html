One of the highest priorities for organizations doing business on the
Internet is to be able to ensure that web applications are secure.
ADP has more than 110 Internet-facing applications. Tens of thousands
of other companies depend on ADP to process their data and also need
assurance that ADP's applications are secure.  In this fascinating
interview, you'll meet the person at ADP responsible for solving this
problem and learn how he did it and what tool he found to automate
the process, and what lessons he learned along the way.


What Works To Reduce Security Vulnerabilities

When Bill Geimer began looking for a better way to do vulnerability
management at USAID, he was dealing with problems of weak reporting,
no remediation guidance, dated information, and critical audit
reports from the Inspector Generals Office.  Bill was able to help
USAID implement a new system that scans effectively, is designed as
an enterprise system, is easy to manage and use, and has good traffic
throttling and documented, detailed criticality ratings.   Using the
new technology, USAID has radically reduced vulnerabilities and gotten
strong support from the system administrators and their managers.
