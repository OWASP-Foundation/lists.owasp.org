Hi Folks

"Announcing Global Security Week in Ireland

Global Security Week is a global security awareness initiative in the
week leading up to September 11th every year.  The idea is simply to
coordinate and encourage a wide variety of security-related awareness
activities worldwide in that week, taking advantage of the obvious
focus on security by the world's media. 

Global Security Week is a public awareness initiative, not a
commercial or political venture. We are not trying to obtain funding,
de-rail other security awareness activities, nor focus on any
particular aspect of security (such as terrorism, information
security or physical security).  Global Security Week is deliberately
designed to be a broadly-scoped event but with a long-term aim to
become the main focus for security awareness activities in years to
come. 

BH Consulting are proud to be involved with Global Security Week and
details of our involvement with Global Security Week can be found on
our website at http://www.bhconsulting.ie/global_security_week.htm. 
More information is also available at
http://www.globalsecurityweek.com.  

As IT Security professionals we should be promoting better security
awareness.  If you wish to participate in Global Security Week, have
any suggestions on events or ways to promote the campaign or require
more information on this worthwhile initiative, please visit the
Global Security Week website or contact me at any of the contact
points below."

I seem to remember something about a recent court case in Ireland that
mandated speed cameras produce a printout of the speeding offence details
i.e. a paper trail as best evidence.

If so, I think this loophole is covered :-(

 

Speeding being a criminal (as opposed to civil) offence requires evidence to
be beyond "a reasonable doubt". 

I would have thought that MD5 hashes even with current weaknesses were
beyond "a reasonable doubt" myself. 

But then, lawyers often cast doubt on electronic evidence in general when it
suits.

I wonder if those guys in China could prove that it's theoretically
possible to fake a photo printout. 

Though I suppose the subtle point would be that it might be hard to fake
the photos en masse. Whereas, if a cryptographic security was cracked,
the exploit could be done many times. That's because it would be done by
computers, rather than leaving cert art students.

I suppose you can also edit cookie data with Tamperdata on the fly but "Add

Folks

Please find below the latest press release regarding Global Security
Week.

"London, August 15th 2005: With just three weeks to go, the countdown
to Global Security Week (5-11th September 2005) has begun.  Final
preparations are in hand for a variety of public and private sector
security awareness initiatives.
 
Global Security Week will take place at the start of next month.
There are just three weeks left to complete the planning and
preparation of security awareness activities to take advantage of the
general media focus on security in the lead up to September 11th.

Whilst there have been many previous security awareness events, this
is the first time an attempt has been made to coordinate and align
such a broad range of public and private sector security awareness
activities all over the world in the same week.  Published dates for
Global Security Weeks over the next five years encourage even the
slowest of organizations to plan their involvement.

By raising awareness, Global Security Week addresses security in the
broad:

All Internet users are part of a global community and mutually
dependent on information security.  It is in everyone's interest to
secure their own IT systems and be a good neighbour on the web. We
all face the threats of spam, malware, phishing and other frauds,
hackers, intellectual property theft, cyberterrorism and
cyberextortion.  We should all take suitable information security
measures to avoid being part of the problem.
Recent terrorist atrocities graphically remind us of our shared
reliance on physical as well as information security.  We must all
remain alert for unattended packages, suspicious behaviour and so
forth. 
Bombs and natural disasters (such as the Indian Ocean tsunami) are
relatively indiscriminate, impacting individuals and organizations
that happen to be there at the time. Knowing what to do, if not
actually being prepared for such situations can literally make the
difference between life and death for people, and survival or
bankruptcy for corporations.

Final preparations are in hand for the first ever Global Security
Week (5-11th September). Global Security Week is an initiative to
link together security awareness activities across the world in the
week leading up to September 11th annually. 

Global Security Week 2005 is the first ever global security awareness
event.

Since launching the initiative and the website
www.GlobalSecurityWeek.com <outbind://4/www.GlobalSecurityWeek.com> 
in June 2005, a small band of volunteers has been working hard behind
the scenes explaining and promoting the event to numerous public and
private bodies with an interest in security. "We have been contacting
security event organisers to inform them about Global Security Week
and explain our aims," said Gary Hinson who conceived the project.
"Despite having been announced less than three months ago, Global
Security Week has surpassed our initial expectations. We have
received expressions of interest and support from all corners of the
globe. Security professionals tell us this is a great idea and want
to get involved."

Large-scale security awareness events inevitably require considerable
preparation and detailed planning, all of which takes time. Whilst
Global Security Week this year may be relatively modest in scale,
worldwide participation is expected to increase markedly in 2006. The
Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), for example, is
planning to announce an International Infosec Day in New York during
or shortly after Global Security Week 2005 with the event itself to
be launched a year later.

By chance, a few established security awareness events such as U.S.
National Security Awareness Day on September 9th
(www.ussecurityawareness.org
<outbind://4/www.ussecurityawareness.org> ) already coincide with
Global Security Week. Organisers of other security awareness events
are encouraged either to reschedule their main events to fall within
Global Security Week from 2006 or to organise something extra during
the week, and thus to share in the publicity the event will
inevitably attract.

The volunteers running Global Security Week share an interest in
promoting security awareness amongst the general public. They are
collaborating with a loose network of security awareness
professionals in public and private organizations who fund and manage
a great variety of security awareness activities. Global Security
Week itself is not a commercial undertaking and is funded by the
volunteers.

For more information on Global Security Week and to volunteer your
support, please visit the website www.GlobalSecurityWeek.com
<outbind://4/www.GlobalSecurityWeek.com>  or contact the organizers
by email (info at globalsecurityweek.com) any time or by telephone

(+44 1428 727 900) during UK office hours.

Brian Honan
