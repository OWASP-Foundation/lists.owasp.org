1. OWASP Live CD Training

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Ireland chapter meeting to be 
held on April 16th, at 2:30pm-5:00pm (show up at venue between 
2:00pm-2:30pm).

As usual our location are the Ernst & Young offices in Dublin who kindly 
agreed to host our event:
- Ernst & Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon Pub, 
Dublin, Ireland

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at 
http://owasp-ireland-livecd.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real 
name, as this will be given to Ernst & Young building security. If you 
don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs 
close midday the day of the event (so we can get names on the door), so 
make sure you RSVP in advance.

A certificate of participation and a copy of the OWASP Live CD will be 
provided to those attending the event. 

Bringing your own laptop is 'optional' in case you want to tryout the 
OWASP Live CD tools during the training. However, there is no test network 
environment available so all testing will have to be done locally in your 
own laptop.

Further details and schedule for the night are available on the chapter 
page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland )

** If you would like to be a sponsor of this or a future event please 
contact me directly at 087-7817468 for details.

2. OWASP Training Sessions / Chapter Meetings

Based on your feedback we are planning to organize the chapter 
meetings/training sessions in the following manner for 2010:

6pm.
- long presentations (2+ hours): these will be held in the afternoons 
around 3pm.

Both formats will be streamed (when possible), recorded and posted online 
for later consultation in case you cannot attend personally.

We are always actively looking for speakers, so if you have a topic you 
would like to present please contact Eoin, Rahim or myself.

It is a very good write up by the Apache Software Foundation incident

exploited, usernames and passwords being stolen and obtaining root

== Talk ==

Title: Trials & Tribulations of WAF Implementation

Abstract: 

A web application firewall (WAF) is an appliance, server plugin, or filter 
that applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation. Generally, these 
rules cover common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL 
Injection. By customizing the rules to your application, many attacks can 
be identified and blocked. The effort to perform this customization can be 
significant and needs to be maintained as the application is modified. 

Mark will be presenting on his experience in implementing a Web 
Application Firewall solution through all phases from research to 
implementation.

== Presenter == 

Mark Hillick - Application Networking Team, Citrix Systems

Mark Hillick has 10 years experience in relation to Internet, networking, 
systems administration and security engineering. 

Mark graduated from Queen's University, where he studied Mathematics. 

Mark joined AIB from Queen's where he joined the Internet Infrastructure 
team, where he was responsible for designing, building and securing the 
Internet service in and out of AIB. He is a prominent member of the IT 
Security community in Ireland and has presented at several local security 
forums such as IISF and Owasp. Mark is one of the founding members of 
IRISS CERT, where he is also a Volunteer Incident Handler. He helped 
organise IRISSCon 2009, where he also designed and built HackEire 2009, 
the first Ethical Hacking  'Capture The Flag' contest in Ireland.

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the 
chapter page (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland).

Just to let you guys know that as a result of the weather conditions,
myself, Tom MacKenzie and Shaun Duncan won't be able to make it to the
OWASP training session. We're all gutted that we can't make it, as we've
been waiting for this for ages and we've all booked hotels and flights
which are probably non-refundable. 

Hope everyone else finds the training session useful and fulfilling, and
we'll probably see you at Appsec Ireland.

Sorry to hear that. I know Ryanair are offering refunds via their website.

You can always download the CD and have a play - I think this is it
http://appseclive.org/content/downloads

And perhaps the slides (if any) will be available afterwards?

At the moment we are not sure, but please do not take our names off as 
it may be okay tomorrow. Shaun and I are lucky to have a plane later in 
the afternoon so may be unaffected but we will see.

Please keep our names on the list and we will let you know tomorrow what

I think a "manual" security code review using open source tools such as 
Code Crawler and Orizon workshop would be good.

Hi Folks,

Thanks for a very informative session.

In terms of another session, secure build and review would be my vote.
Let me know if there is anything I can help with. I could get meeting
room space here at BearingPoint Ireland, for starters.

Regards,
JM

hey John,

I'm really glad you'd enjoyed the session... we will definitely have more 
of these in the near future.

thanks for your offer... if there is a requirement for such equipment in 
any of the trainings I will let you know.

thread modelling... could be an interesting topic... anyone in the list 
interested to deliver a workshop about the subject please contact me.

based on the feedback from several people we might organize a training 
about code review in the upcoming months.

Fabio 

PS: I didn't know about my beer getaway... next one is on me ;-)

John sounds like a good topic alongside Richie's code review suggestion.

We could do some threat-modelling as part of the review process also, this
is normally what I do as part of a "Triage" meeting to gain context at the
initial stages of code review.

Our own David Lowery added the Threat modelling chapter to the Code review
guide, Dave would you like to present/co-present.

Hi Shivi,

Detective measures can not (normally) be examined using pen testing such as
:
(Some of these would not be performed during runtime testing as the tests
may be too invasive on production systems.)

CRLF/Audit attacking: Damaging log integrity or logging untrusted input to
logs directly without any input validation, sanitisation, length checking.
Logger DoS: Log overflow which may cause availability issues on some systems
due to poor error handling.

Auditing/Logging: at the correct place, information leakage, privacy,
logging the right things.

Denial of service: Generally you wont test for this during a penetration
test but you can detect this very easily with code review: broken logic,
infinite loops, buffer overflows etc

Resource management: Database connection pool release, file handle release
etc in the event of an error.

Error handling: Fail open, Default secure posture in the event of an error.

Message-ID: <OF8888FAE0.BDB80946-ON8025770A.004575C5-8025770A.0045A0D8@ad.aib.pri>

Dear all,

On April 19th, OWASP released the final version of the Top 10 for 2010. 
The OWASP Top Ten provides a powerful awareness document for web 
application security. This version was updated based on comments received 
during the comment period after the release candidate was released in Nov. 
2009. 

Click here to download the OWASP Top 10 - 2010 Final Release.

The OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks for 2010 are: 

A1: Injection 
A2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
A3: Broken Authentication and Session Management 
A4: Insecure Direct Object References 
A5: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
A6: Security Misconfiguration 
A7: Insecure Cryptographic Storage 
A8: Failure to Restrict URL Access 
A9: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection 
A10: Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards 

Please help us make sure every developer knows about the OWASP Top 10 by 
helping to spread the world!!! 

As you help us spread the word, please emphasize: 

- OWASP is reaching out to developers, not just the application security 
community.
- The Top 10 is about managing risk, not just avoiding vulnerabilities. 
- To manage these risks, organizations need an application risk management 
program, not just awareness training, app testing, and remediation. 

Thank you,

Title: Trials & Tribulations of WAF Implementation

Abstract: 

A web application firewall (WAF) is an appliance, server plugin, or filter 
that applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation. Generally, these 
rules cover common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL 
Injection. By customizing the rules to your application, many attacks can 
be identified and blocked. The effort to perform this customization can be 
significant and needs to be maintained as the application is modified. 

Mark will be presenting on his experience in implementing a Web 
Application Firewall solution through all phases from research to 
implementation.

== Presenter == 

Mark Hillick - Application Networking Team, Citrix Systems

Mark Hillick has 10 years experience in relation to Internet, networking, 
systems administration and security engineering. 

Mark graduated from Queen's University, where he studied Mathematics. 

Mark joined AIB from Queen's where he joined the Internet Infrastructure

Hi Folks,

a cellphone hack...

That looks like it would have been an entertaining talk. There are one or
two issues that I'd have with it though:

1) It's easier (in Ireland at any rate) to access the voice mail box on a
phone - If your number is 08y xxxxxxx you just place a 5 between the third
and fourth digits, saving the messging around with the two simultaneous
calls that they talk about. But, At the same time though, there is a PIN
code that needs to be entered and I didn't see anything in the presentation
around getting past that, so I assume it's based around people leaving the
defaults on.

2) HLRs are being swapped out with HSSs at the moment; which should mitigate
the risk of direct connections to the location register database. (HSSs use
DIAMETER for connections and to the best of my knowledge requires some
amount of Authentication before serving info)

3) A MSC can cover a huge geographical area. I wouldn't be too worried about
someone knowing the MSC that I had connected to, or the MCC, as there are
easier ways to find out that information and (I would feel that) it is too
vague to be useful.

4) Pairing an Identity to the IMSI seemed to be reliant on the target
responding to a missed call & having an un-hidden number. I may have misread
that part, but that seemed to be what they were getting at. I am pretty sure
that Tiger Woods doesn't randomly call back everyone who rings him. Or maybe
he does, or at the very least, maybe he used to. I would imagine he isn't
allowed ring anyone anymore without consulting his Wife first.
