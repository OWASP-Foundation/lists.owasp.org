== Talk ==

Title: Trials &amp; Tribulations of WAF Implementation

Abstract: 

A web application firewall (WAF) is an appliance, server plugin, or filter 
that applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation. Generally, these 
rules cover common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL 
Injection. By customizing the rules to your application, many attacks can 
be identified and blocked. The effort to perform this customization can be 
significant and needs to be maintained as the application is modified. 

Mark will be presenting on his experience in implementing a Web 
Application Firewall solution through all phases from research to 
implementation.

== Presenter == 

Mark Hillick - Application Networking Team, Citrix Systems

Mark Hillick has 10 years experience in relation to Internet, networking, 
systems administration and security engineering. 

Mark graduated from Queen's University, where he studied Mathematics. 

Mark joined AIB from Queen's where he joined the Internet Infrastructure 
team, where he was responsible for designing, building and securing the 
Internet service in and out of AIB. He is a prominent member of the IT 
Security community in Ireland and has presented at several local security 
forums such as IISF and Owasp. Mark is one of the founding members of 
IRISS CERT, where he is also a Volunteer Incident Handler. He helped 
organise IRISSCon 2009, where he also designed and built HackEire 2009, 
the first Ethical Hacking  'Capture The Flag' contest in Ireland.

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the 
chapter page (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland</A>).

3. Secure Application Development on Facebook Platform

This document provides a basic outline/best practice for developing secure 
applications on the Facebook platform. Facebook applications are web, 
desktop, or mobile applications that make use of the Facebook API to 
integrate tightly with the social network experience. This document is 
designed for the Facebook developer, but it can also be used as a 
reference for non-technical readers. Depending on the reader&#8217;s level of 
technical understanding of security vulnerability classes and the Facebook 
platform, sections of the document may be skimmed or skipped

Here you could find the full article:

4. Google Web Application Exploits and Defenses 

The folks at Google have released some web app training, along with a 
vulnerable web app sandbox to play in. The tool is called Jarlsberg. 

Google's &quot;Web Application Exploits and Defenses&quot; codelab can be used in a 
black-box setting, in which hackers aren't privy to the source code of the 
application they're attacking, or a white-box setting, in which they are.

There's also an instructor's guide available at:
