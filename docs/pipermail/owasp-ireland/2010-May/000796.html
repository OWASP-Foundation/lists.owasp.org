== Talk ==

Title: Define Security Requirements - A practical approach
 
Abstract:   

The Data Protection Act states that &quot;appropriate security measures&quot; must 
be taken to protect personal data. How do you specify the appropriate 
security measures for a website which processes personal data? It is an 
important step in a development project, but is often neglected. In this 
talk, Alexis will descibe his own experiences of assessing web 
application, and will also look in more detail at what the Data Protection 
Commissioner says. He will then take a fictional website and look at a 
practical approach to specifying the security requirements that the 
fictional application should meet. This will use the kind of risk-based 
techniques outlined by OWASP or the Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle 
(SDL). Issues discussed will include encryption, authentication, access 
control, audit, etc. The result will be a list of security requirements 
that can be carried into the design and development phases. Attendees 
should be able to apply the ideas to their own development projects.
