** Top Down; Bottom Up
------------------------------------------------------------

Application Security is an inherently creative process where we try to control for known attack patterns but must remain alert to the less predictable activities of attackers. In order to manage this process security teams must employ many points of view and remain conscious of requirements and limitations on developers.

Comprehensive security strategies must take the approach of integrating top down practices with bottom up considerations. AppSec Europe 2018 will be discussing the theme of Top Down; Bottom Up security from the point of view of experts from all corners of the industry.


** Announcing the 2018 AppSec Europe Keynotes
------------------------------------------------------------
AppSec Europe is once again bringing together the most influential speakers, challenging convention and inspiring the next generation of security leaders. These speakers will inspire you with fresh ideas, have you rethink the status quo and leave you ready to tackle application challenges in innovative ways.
