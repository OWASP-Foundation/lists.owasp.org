Hi all

We are delighted to to welcome Gavin O?Gorman and Alain Abou Tass for our
latest OWASP Dublin Chapter meeting. Registration will start from 6:30pm
25th February with talks beginning at 7:00pm.

There will be beer and Pizza generously provided by Morgan McKinley


Gavin O?Gorman? Symantec -
Working in Symantec for the past six years, Gavin is an intelligence
analyst on the attack investigations team. Before moving to the attack
investigations team in 2013, he worked as a reverse engineer, and later as
an incident handler. Gavin?s primary role is to gather together information
from both Symantec data sources, and open sources, in order to build a
comprehensive picture of an attack, or attackers. Another aspect of the job
is to work with law enforcement to assist in the investigation of e-crime
where possible. Prior to working in Symantec, Gavin spent several years
researching network security in Dublin City University, and currently
lectures part-time for the Masters in Security & Forensics course.


Alain Abou Tass ? Ward Solutions - Web applications on the battlefield
Penetration testers spend most of their time identifying security holes.
Sometimes if we?re lucky enough, we hit the jackpot. In this talk, I will
be detailing some instances of real life attacks on web applications. I?ll
show how one small vulnerability, in conjunction with others, can be lethal
and lead to a big breach. This will highlight the importance of fixing the
small issues that are usually neglected. Also, I?ll show some interesting
tricks that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities.


Please use the eventbrite link below to register, hope to see you all
there: -

Message-ID: <CAE2kEQRGaD6DetwtRdgnhEw=57x8Jh188cDYPra8LWKFwkrQKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello local Dublin Board,

As the chapter lead position is now drawing to the end of the current 2
year cycle (as per governance handbook), could you advise on the following
in the OWASP spirit of openness and transparency:

- How can one be nominated to join the current board. What is the process
here?
- How is the board going to handle selection of a new chapter leader?
- Will there be a community vote or will this be a closed board-only vote?
If the latter, will votes be transparent? I know that this exact process
differs across OWASP chapters, but is well documented in the governance
handbook.

I have had a few queries on this of late from the community and your
clarification would be appreciated.

Looking forward to your response!

Cheers,
Rahim

Hi Everyone,

Thanks to everybody who attended the Dublin chapter meeting yesterday and
we hope you found it intersting. We'd like to thank both Gavin and Alain
for taking the time to present and for their informative presentations.

To summarise for anyone who couldn't attend.

Gavin O'Gorman from Symantec gave an excellent talk on malware and
techniques that are currently being employed in the wild. Alain Abou Tass
from Ward Solutions gave a presentation on web application penetration
techniques and how combining vulnerabilities can result in a greater
aggregated risk to organisations. Both sessions prompted interesting
discussions from the group. Pizza, beer and soft drinks were provided by
our generous hosts Morgan McKinley <http://www.morganmckinley.ie/>.

Alain's presentations is on the wiki at the URL below.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland-Dublin

We'll be sending out information shortly on the next chapter meeting
shortly and we hope you can join us next time.

Many Thanks,

Tony
