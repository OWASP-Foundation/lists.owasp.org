It's difficult to find a much comprehensive report on trends on IT security,
those guys at IBM are accurate and almost the first ones to deliver a report
on what happened during 2008...

You will probably want to have a look a the annual security report from
Cisco, with less numbers though (registration required):

http://cisco.com/en/US/prod/vpndevc/annual_security_report.html

...and the one from Symantec/MessageLabs, more on spam and phishing threats:

Hi all,

I came across a small series of virtualisation security training videos
(http://www.internetevolution.com/tutorial_virtualizationsecurity.asp)
today from Joshua Corman of IBM. They won't turn you into an expert on
this subject but they are good for an introduction into this area.

How is that research going?
Do you think the output of it could be a candidate for the OWASP Ireland

Hi Eoin,

I had been distracted off on to something else but I can pick it back up
and I'm sure it could make for an interesting topic at OWASP Ireland.

Thanks,

Dave

Hi,
Just thought id let you know about a new tool freely available called code
crawler.

it is based on the OWASP code review guide V1.1 which is to be officially
released very soon.

OWASP CC [binaries]:
http://www.cyphersec.com/software_archive/OWASP_Code_Crawler.zip

OWASP CC [source]:
http://www.cyphersec.com/software_archive/OWASP_Code_Crawler_Source.zip

OWAS CC [PowerPoint]:
https://www.owasp.org/images/6/61/OWASP_CodeCrawler_Presentation.ppt

The search strings are defined in XML so it is easy to add a new
technology/language to the tool.

Please send some feedback on this, what you like, dont like et and any
suggestions fro future improvement.


Eoin

This version looks very good, it certainly has come a long way since I
first used this last year.

Hello,

May I ask the mail list what the appetite would be for application
security training?

I may be able to get some security training vendors to deliver some at
minimal cost, (?300 - 400 for the day), or even free in some cases.
any suggestions on type or training or expressions of interest to attend?

RSVP
thanks,


Eoin

Perhaps I might be so bold as to suggest a complimentary offer from you the
OWASP community? The general level of comprehension within the web
application development community of the general first principles of secure
application development are low. Yes it is true, and for any meaningful
change to occur it is encumbent upon us to educate. So I will put my foot
forward and agree to give up some of my time to provide some level of
instruction, training and education on a voluntary basis for anyone who
wishes to attend on how to design secure web applications. Perhaps someone
can work with me to follow this up with how to code secure web applications,
closely followed by someone to instruct on how to test web applications for
'security'? I am based in Dublin but I am willing to travel, again at my own
expense to collaborate, educate and dissimiate the message.
Regards,
 Conor.

I suppose not to do things in the singular I will make my second post to the
list within an hour or so of my first. Here again as a community (and here I
am talking about the global OWASP community) we have an opportunity to be
volunteers and use our energise in a positive way. This report is a report
on a report from a commercial vendor (Breach) who collates incident
information from 'publically reported' breaches. So we are talking here
about 80% of the 1% of reported breaches that Breach classify as based on
some form of SQL Injection, XSS or hybrid attack, maybe, perhaps, kind of
....... This is lazy journalism at best.

To better inform our training, education, techniques and methods of design
we need REAL information based on REAL attacks and REAL incidents. How can
we begin to collate this information? I remeber that both SANS and Security
Focus (in conjuction with DShield) made brave efforts to collate global IDS
and firewall logs. Not a great strategy. We recieved information on patterns
and trends which was useful for tuning IDS patterns to drop false positives
but not a lot beyond that.

What is the solution I have some ideas but as a community we need to decide
together. So I am throwing this bone out there. What is the right way to
capture, identify and report on statistical levels of attacks and breaches
so that we a community of web developers can produce secure web applications
now and in the future? Who should collect this information? Should we lobby
our TD's for California style disclosure laws? Should we collate the
information privately as a community? Now that the OWASP is asking us the
community for subscriptions should we demand quality and timely information
...

Conor.

hi,

Point taken, one thing to remember is that Offer (CTO at breach) also
organises the WSAC incident database.
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/

I believe much of the data in the breach report is from the WSAC (Web
application security consortium) database and not procured by breach
themselves.
Many of the incidents are submitted by individuals.
Breach have also been big supporters of OWASP but as you say such a report
does have some commercial aspect.

Actually it wasn't the report itself I was commenting on, rather the article
on darkreading which was referencing the report. So apologies if it seemed I
was diminishing the report itself. The fact that the article didn't qualify
the source and scope of the data leads you to believe that these are
statistics which are compiled from a large data pool.
The choice on which areas to concentrate current attention within web
application security is a valuable one. The OWASP top ten list for example
is a good effort in this direction. What would make this approach all the
more valuable would be good quality statistics on a wide data pool that
would help us all understand the nature of the threat environment and
therefore help us to defend our applications.
I thought the perhaps OWASP as an organisation could consider becoming an
advocate/lobby group to goverenments and the EU for mandatory reporting to
national data comissioners. These data comissioners could anonomously
compile the statistics and publish them at national or EU level. If this
data was available on this scale I think it would greatly help improve the
overall level of threat knowledge. Just my two bits though (1,0).
Regards,
 Conor.
