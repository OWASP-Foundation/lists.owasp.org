<PRE>Hi

IRISSCERT www.iriss.ie is running a security campaign called &quot;Brush Up Your Security&quot; aimed at promoting good password hygiene and management amongst second and third level students.  The campaign consists of using the toothbrush as a reminder to people to treat their passwords like they would their toothbrush- choose it wisely, use it regularly, change it often and never share it with anyone.  

The campaign consists of
- Distributing 20,000 toothbrushes with leaflets to schools and colleges to get the message directly to the students
- Distributing posters for use in schools, colleges and clubs
- A FaceBook campaign to promote the message further.  There is also a change to win a netbook for those that fill out our survey on password usage on that page at <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/SmileIreland">https://www.facebook.com/SmileIreland</A>
- Radio Ads and other promotions via media

The above is being organised by volunteers from IRISSCERT and the Institute of Technology in Blanchardstown.

If any members would like us to include a local school or college in the campaign please feel free to contact us.  

We appreciate if people also could spread the word amongst those they know about the campaign and in particular our FaceBook page <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/SmileIreland">https://www.facebook.com/SmileIreland</A> where they can get more information.

Thanks

Brian
