Speaker Schedule for IRISSCERT Conference Now Available
We are delighted to announce that Mr. Howard A Schmidt, Cyber-Security 
Coordinator to the President of the United States of America, will be 
addressing our upcoming conference on the 18th of November in the Berkley 
Court Hotel in Dublin 4.
As well Mr. Schmidt we have many other information security experts lined 
up to address our conference.  Amongst these experts are
Mr. Billy Hawkes, The Data Protection Commissioner
Detective Inspector Paul Gillen from An Garda Siochana Computer Crime Unit
Chris Boyd from GFI Software
Bob McCardle from Trend Micro Ireland.
The speaker list and the schedule for the day is now available on our 
website.
The IRISSCERT Annual Conference is an opportunity to not only increase 
your knowledge but also to meet and network with your peers in a relaxed 
environment.  There is no charge to attend the conference, simply send an 
email with your details to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-ireland">info at iriss.ie.</A>
In parallel to the above speaking sessions Ireland's premier Cyber 
Security Challenge, HackEire, will be held to identify Ireland's top cyber 
security experts.  HackEire will see 10 teams, up to a maximum of four 
people per team, compete against each other in a controlled environment to 
see which team will be the first to exploit weaknesses in a number of 
systems and declare victory.  The purpose of the HackEire competition is 
to demonstrate how attackers could gain access to your systems and allow 
you to learn from the event on how to prevent such attacks from impacting 
your network.  There is still room available for more teams to sign up, if 
you feel up to the challenge you can enter the competition by sending an 
email to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-ireland">info at iriss.ie.</A>
