<PRE>Hello OWASP'ers

A few announcements:

A cyber crime seminar as part of Global Security week is on next wednesday
(10/9) , see email below.

The code review guide v1.1 shall be published soon (in October I hope.) it
shall be showcased @ the NY conf on at then end of this month and
highlighted during the OWASP summit meeting in November in Portugal. I shall
have some copies for a forthcoming meeting.

Next OWASP meeting is to be scheduled. I am looking for suggestions on
what would we like to cover? I am personally suggesting to cover some more
client side attacks and also a taxonomy of an internal breach in an
enterprise network?
Looking at some tools, hybrid attacks using N/W and AppSec vulnerabilities
and Vulnerability linkage.

Any other suggestions, don't be shy.

regards,

ek

Hi Eoin

I am running a free conference on Cyber Crime next Wednesday the 10th at
14:00 at Jury's Doyle hotel Croke Park as part of Global Security Week.

I will have members of the Computer Crime Unit in the Gardai and a number of
industry experts speaking on how companies and individuals can best protect
themselves from cyber crime.

The seminar is free and there will be no selling at it.  I thought it might
be something that would be of interest to OWASP Ireland and would appreciate
it if you could spread the word.

Anyone needing more information can contact me or look at
