Hi Folks,

As you may know, if you are a paid up member that the global board
elections are now live in addition to the Dublin chapter re-run. I'd
encourage you to vote in both if you are eligable!

May take this time to endorse *Martin Knobloch, Johanna Curiel* and *Matt
Konda* for your consideration.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Martin_Knobloch_2016_Bio_%26_Why_Me%3F
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Matt_Konda_2016_Bio_%26_Why_Me%3F
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Johanna_Curiel_2016_Bio_%26_Why_Me%3F

All have been heavily involved in OWASP for many years including
organisation of major conferences, project leadership. Martin has
tirelessly promoted OWASP globally for near on 10 years. Matt is an
incumbent board member and has done a great job in his role. Johanna would *be
the first woman* OWASP board member and is passionate about keeping the O
 in OWASP center stage.


If you have a vote please use it, software has died to give you this right
:)

Thanks,
Eoin

Message-ID: <CAFs_57yecLFqDBrk88YkDw4M3Kp9FDhWYxfcrAdEBJAJwgCp2w@mail.gmail.com>

The Dublin chapter is dedicated to openness and transparency.  On 30th
March 2016 we announced an election to replace two board members and open
the board to non-officer positions for volunteers.  During this process the
goals for the Dublin Chapter grew in ambition and inclusiveness.
Subsequently our new board agreed to expand the officer positions and hold
an election for all positions with the aim to further improve participation
and so achieve even greater events.



In our zeal we made the new announcements on the same email chain sent out
to only the members of the newly enlarged board.  Due to our commitment to
transparency, we are keen for you, as a member of OWASP, to have your say
and therefore are re-holding the election with the same candidates to
ensure that all of our members have an opportunity to vote.



We invite you to renew your OWASP Dublin subscription (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership) and, as paid members affiliated
with OWASP Dublin, ensure that you have your say in the direction of the
chapter. We invite all paying members to participate in this election. The
election will commence on 20th October and end on 27th October.



As always, whether you are a paying member or not, please feel free to
express your thoughts and opinions on the Dublin chapter in public (on our
distribution list, Facebook, Twitter, etc) or directly with any board
member. We are very keen to ensure the chapter is open, transparent and
that we work to benefit the community and any thoughts or opinions that can
help us improve these objectives will be welcomed. Also, if you want to
play a more active role in the Dublin chapter please let one of us know.

	[questions]
Message-ID: <CAJdNA63BUsXxXa41E237JZpSupEsMVKNc77kNGpPk7jXB0iAeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP Members,

I am interested in becoming a speaker on upcoming AppSec EU 2017 in
Belfast. Because I've never been a speaker on such huge conference earlier,
I''d like to figure out is there any chance to be able to speak :)

My questions are:
- do I have to have some previous experience in conference speaking? I was
presenting a couple of thing during various local meetups in my hometown
earlier, but it was nothing big (20-30 attendees maybe)
- do I have to be OWASP member?
- is there any date for Call For Papers already set?

I am aware of the fact that my topic has to be accepted first but as I have
to (and want to) prepare my presentation in every single detail - please
forgive me if I'm asking too early.

Thank you,

Best Regards,

Rafal Janicki

Hi Rafal,

Thanks so much for your interest in the conference! We're so excited to be
hosting in Belfast next May.

The Call for Papers will be announced very soon (this week or next). We are
just checking the last few details before we publish so keep an eye on
2017.appsec.eu

Full details of requirements will be included in there. Previous speaking
experience will be considered by the selection committee but would not
automatically rule you out so please do submit a paper and include your
local Meetup experience as it is all relevant.

You do not have to be an OWASP member to speak at the conference & as I
mentioned the date for CfP is this week or next.

Look forward to seeing you at the conference & speaking hopefully!

Kind regards
Michelle
