Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Summer BBQ
Message-ID: <8F0A497E-A13C-44A2-9641-11227D153E21@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone,

The annual security summer BBQ will be held on 17th August at 6 pm in the Odessa club in Dublin. The event is in conjunction with ISACA & IISF and is purely a social occasion and an opportunity to network and meet other security professionals. Symantec are sponsoring the event again this year.

Due to the venues capacity, places are limited to approximately 30 from each of the groups. 

This year we are collecting for the Dublin Simon Community so please bring some cash and give generously as there will be a collection and it is for a good cause.

Kind Regards,

James Veitch - Scamming the Scammers for a Laugh

OWASP Dublin are delighted to announce our next event this Friday night 
in The Liquor Rooms in Dublin city centre.

Spam and phishing emails are a constant nuisance but are big bucks for 
criminals. However, there is a lighter side! We're delighted to announce 
James Veitch, TED speaker, comedian and author will be joining us at the 
next OWASP Dublin event to talk about his Internet adventures and have a 
beer. See him live before he takes part in the Vodafone Comedy Festival 
this weekend. Registration is free on Eventbrite below. Feel free to 
share with colleagues who would be interested.
