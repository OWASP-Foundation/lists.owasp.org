Hi Everyone,

Things are really ramping up for AppSec EU in just a few weeks and we're
super excited about seeing all our planning start to come together.

We're hoping to see you at some point during the week of the conference and
are still looking for volunteers. If you'd like to be there and the price
of the ticket is a bit of a stretch, or if you just want to be involved and
help out, why not volunteer? We're extremely grateful for your support and
for everyone who has already offered to help :) Register to volunteer here
- https://2017.appsec.eu/program/call-for-volunteers

We'd also appreciate anything you can do to promote the conference within
your networks.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
