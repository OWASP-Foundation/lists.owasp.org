Dear all,

Apologies about my absence but as some of you might know I was on the other
side of the Atlantic.

Thanks Alexis for delivering the talk... I've heard it was very well
received by those who attended the event.

And thanks Eoin & Rahim for putting this together while I was away... I owe
you a couple more pints.

For those who would like to receive the certificate of participation please
send me your details.

Thanks everyone for coming and I will keep you posted about future events.

Best regards,

Fabio

Ok,
This is not Michael J Fox related and a little more accurate (depending on
who you ask).

Daniel,

Do you have any  links to information about paying developers to introduce
"accidental" security holes into apps?  I'm thinking about starting a
database to track incidents of malicious insider developer abuse.  What do
you think?

Interesting. 

I've seen cases where developers had been paid to 'introduce' sql injection
bugs into code.

	Event
Message-ID: <28780.29734.qm@web31008.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Just wanted to announce "VSXRXDENBWKKVL3OVLDUDMXVROFJDIN=" which is?the capture 
the flag event for this years conference on September 17th in Trinity College. 
The event caters for novices and experts alike -?put your?hacking skills to the 
test! 

?
Description as follows:

A group of beer drinking space travellers have worked for a few months to create 
a game that shall be played during the conference. The purpose of the game 
(which has the original name VSXRXDENBWKKVL3OVLDUDMXVROFJDIN=) is to score 
points in different categories, ranging from questions around Hacking Culture 
and History, breaking into some systems until blowing up your brains with 
assembly with reversing binaries. In each category, there are levels for the 
Young Padawans among us where they will learn the basics, but there are also 
levels which will be difficult to solve in a full day (hint: create a team of 
space travellers which have different skills of yours). Unlike the LIGATTs of 
this world, we do not have one million in cash, but we do have prizes for the 
chosen ones.

Hello All

The uploaded presentation also includes the slides on the User Life 
Cycle steps which I never got to during the talk.

The User Life Cycle section suggests good practices around the various 
stages:

    * Identification
    * Registration/Enrolment
    * Logon/Logoff
    * Forgotten Password Mechanism
    * Logoff/Account Deletion


The exact link to the presentation is:

    * http://www.owasp.org/images/4/45/OWASP_Ireland_June10.pdf

If any of you have questions or other feedback, please feel free to 
contact me.

Thanks once again to E&Y for hosting the event and to then OWASP Ireland 
Chapter for arranging it.

cheerio

Alexis

== Talk == Title: Security Implications and Solutions for Web
Applications based on SOA
Abstract:
The main point of SOA (in this context) is combining systems and
applications to make new applications, or a big 'overall' application.

This higher inter-operability does (by default) lower security. For a
start, a request originating from a web user might end up at several
back end systems, which do not know who or what the request came from.

Each back end system might have no access to the customer data, have a
different security models, and serve serveral front end. Each of the
above systems could be under different ownership, thus the owners have
different concerns and priorities. Also, the basic solution at a
technical level include single sign on, or security as a service. This
can be costly, give limited coverage and have a performance hit. But
is pretty much the only way to do it. The other thing to do (probably
in tandem) is strict management, and delegation of authority.

== Presenters ==

John Marmelstein has about 13 years in IT. Most of this in distributed
systems and 'Middleware' integration software. Including BEA (now
owned by Oracle). Mainly working on Enterprise Java and more recently
on Microsoft BizTalk. Various industries, incuding financials, public
services, and a fish farm.?

== Talk == 

Title: Security Implications and Solutions for Web Applications based on 
SOA

Abstract:

The main point of SOA (in this context) is combining systems and 
applications to make new applications, or a big 'overall' application.

This higher inter-operability does (by default) lower security. For a 
start, a request originating from a web user might end up at several back 
end systems, which do not know who or what the request came from.

Each back end system might have no access to the customer data, have a

limited coverage and have a performance hit. But is pretty much the only 
way to do it. The other thing to do (probably in tandem) is strict 
management, and delegation of authority.

systems and 'Middleware' integration software. Including BEA (now owned by 
Oracle). Mainly working on Enterprise Java and more recently on Microsoft 
BizTalk. Various industries, incuding financials, public services, and a 
fish farm.

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the 
chapter page:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland.


3. Facebook Vulnerability: Like Clickjacking 

The Facebook Open Graph Like Button is susceptible to a type of attack 
known as clickjacking. Basically, if the like button is embedded on the 
page you?re on, made completely transparent, then an attacker could trick 
you into Liking something without your discretion.

More information about this vulnerability here: 
http://erickerr.com/like-clickjacking

4. Struts2/XWork remote command execution

Apache Struts team has announced uploaded but has not released, due to an 
unreasonably prolonged voting process, the 2.2.0 release of the Struts2 
web framework which fixes vulnerability reported back on May 31st 2010.

http://blog.o0o.nu/2010/07/cve-2010-1870-struts2xwork-remote.html

5. HTML5, Local Storage, and XSS 

A nice new feature of HTML 5 is local storage. Briefly, this is a client 
side storage option that can be easily accessed via JavaScript. The 
benefit of local storage over other client side storage options is that 
local storage allows more storage space than other options (cookies, flash 
obj, etc). However, there are a few security considerations that should be 
evaluated before completely jumping on board with local storage.

The complete article here:

http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/2010/07/html5-local-storage-and-xss.html

6. Spring Framework execution of arbitrary code

The Spring Framework provides a mechanism to use client provided data to 
update the properties of an object. This mechanism allows an attacker to 
modify the properties of the class loader used to load the object (via 
'class.classloader'). This can lead to arbitrary command execution since, 
for example, an attacker can modify the URLs used by the class loader to 
point to locations controlled by the attacker.

*Re: OWASP Ireland September 17th 2010*

Hello,
The agenda has been finalised for the OWASP Ireland event. We have the
pleasure to announce a number of key figures from industry which should
provide some unique insight into the latest trends, threats and
methodologies in the world of application security.
*http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010*<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010>

*Keynotes*:

*John Viega: ?Application Security in the Real World? - Considerations for
AppSec in non-security companies.*

John is Executive Vice President of Products and Engineering at Perimeter
E-Security. John has authored numerous books on security, including the
recent ?Myths of Security?, and the seminal ?Building Secure Software?,
which was the first book on application security.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/John_Viega

*Professor Fred Piper "The changing face of cryptography" *

Fred Piper was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of
London in 1975 and has worked in information security since 1979. In 1985,
he formed a company, Codes & Ciphers Ltd, which offers consultancy advice in
all aspects of information security. He has acted as a consultant to over 80
companies including a number of financial institutions and major industrial
companies in the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, South Africa and the USA. The
consultancy work has been varied and has included algorithm design and
analysis, work on EFTPOS and ATM networks, data systems, security audits,
risk analysis and the formulation of security policies. He has lectured
worldwide on information security, both academically and commercially, has
published more than 100 papers and is joint author of Cipher Systems (1982),
one of the first books to be published on the subject of protection of
communications, Secure Speech Communications (1985), Digital Signatures -

Educational Advisor for the Ireland-China EMERSION project. His research
interests include Differentiated Instruction, Computer Security,
Technostress, ICT and Special Needs, Virtual Learning Environments, Image
reconstruction from specular reflections, and Lateral Thinking Techniques.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Damian_Gordon
*We also have some great international and local speakers covering topics
from Smart phone application security to SDLC to Penetration testing
techniques:*

?         Dan Cornell ("Smart Phones with Dumb Apps")

?         Ryan Berg ("Path to a Secure Application")

?         Dr Marian Ventunaec ("Testing the Enterprise E-mail Security -
from Software to Cloud-based Services")

?         Fred Donovan and (?Counter Intelligence as Defense???)

?         Nick Coblentz (?Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle???) but
to name a few



http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010#Agenda_and_Presentations_-_September_17



*Training*:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010#Training

Secure application development training shall also be held on the 16th (day
prior to the event):

*?Secure Application Development: Writing secure code (and testing it)?*

Testing shall be delivered by Eoin Keary, OWASP board member and ?The OWASP
Code Review Guide? (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project) Lead &
Rahm Jina, Senior consultant with Ernst & Young.

This intensive one-day course focuses on the most common web application
security problems, including aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten (2010) and
the MITRE Top 25.  The course will introduce and demonstrate application
assessment techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be
exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such
vulnerabilities in their code, covering of the following areas:

Unvalidated Input

Injection Flaws

Cross-Site Scriping

CSRF

Authentication & Session Management

Access control & Authorisation

Broken Caching

Error Handling

Cryptography

Resource Management

Rich Internet Applications & Webservices

The Secure SDLC

1. OWASP Ireland 2010 Conference: Register Early to win an Ipod Touch!

We are approaching fast to the biggest Application Security Conference in 
Ireland.

And just to make it more exciting we are going to raffle TWO Ipod Touch 
among those who register for the conference before our next chapter 
meeting on 11th August (more details below).

So grab your ticket in the URL below and be in a chance to win one of 
these great gadgets!

https://guest.cvent.com/EVENTS/Register/IdentityConfirmation.aspx?e=679c382d-35c2-4815-a399-c2c3a95ebfd7


You could get all the details about this event including updated agenda, 
keynote speakers, training available, etc in the URL below:

2. OWASP Ireland August Event: New Speaker Announced & Updated Agenda

We are slightly modifying the agenda to include another speaker to the 
August Event.

The event will kick-off at 6pm and the updated agenda looks as follows:

6pm: ESAPI Swingset: Introduction & Demo by Cathal Courtney
6:30pm: Security Implications for Web Applications based on SOA
7:30pm: Ipod Touch Raffle (only open to OWASP Ireland 2010 ticket holders)

OWASP ESAPI Swingset: Introduction & Demo by Cathal Courtney

The ESAPI Swingset is a web application which demonstrates common security 
vulnerabilities and asks users to secure the application against these 
vulnerabilities using the ESAPI library.

The application is intended for Java Developers. The goal of the 
application is to teach developers about the functionality of the ESAPI 
library and give users a practical understanding of how it can be used to 
protect web applications against common security vulnerabilities.

During the talk, Cathal will demonstrate how to install and use ESAPI 
Swingset in your organization. A copy of the latest version will be also 
provided to the attendees.

Cathal is an experienced developer working at AIB and is currently the 
ESAPI Swingset project leader.

More information about this project could be found here: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI_Swingset

Security Implications for Web Applications based on SOA

The main point of SOA (in this context) is combining systems and 
applications to make new applications, or a big 'overall' application.

This higher inter-operability does (by default) lower security. For a 
start, a request originating from a web user might end up at several back 
end systems, which do not know who or what the request came from.

Each back end system might have no access to the customer data, have a 
different security models, and serve serveral front end. Each of the above 
systems could be under different ownership, thus the owners have different 
concerns and priorities. Also, the basic solution at a technical level 
include single sign on, or security as a service. This can be costly, give 
limited coverage and have a performance hit. But is pretty much the only 
way to do it. The other thing to do (probably in tandem) is strict 
management, and delegation of authority.

John has about 13 years in IT. Most of this in distributed systems and 
'Middleware' integration software. Including BEA (now owned by Oracle). 
Mainly working on Enterprise Java and more recently on Microsoft BizTalk. 
Various industries, incuding financials, public services, and a fish farm.

As usual our location are the Ernst & Young offices in Dublin who kindly 
agreed to host our event:

- Ernst & Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon Pub, 
Dublin, Ireland

As last time, we should have plenty of time to have a talk and a few 
drinks afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at

http://owasp-ireland-august.eventbrite.com.

Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Ernst & Young 
building security.

If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building.

A certificate of participation will be provided to those attending the 
event.

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the 
chapter page:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland.


3. Citibank admits Iphone App Security Flaw 

Citi is advising customers to install an upgrade for its iPhone m-banking 
application after admitting a flaw in the previous version resulted in it 
improperly storing customer account information.

More on this story: 
http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=21644

4. web2py - A Framework That Cares About Security

The web2py creators clearly kept security in mind from the design phase, 
and it shows in the end result. web2py is immune to many attacks on 
session management and routing because those components were designed with 
security in mind.

Check out web2py?s page on http://www.pythonsecurity.org for more details.

5. Timing Attacks Explained

Probably the most interesting bit of security research that happened this 
week was the dropping of this little bombshell by Taylor Nelson of Root 
Labs:

Every OpenID implementation I have checked this far has contained timing 
dependent compares in the HMAC verification, allowing a remote attacker to 
forge valid tokens.

You could find the full article here: 
http://www.emerose.com/timing-attacks-explained

6. Taint Mode for Python

Juanjo Conti has done some fantastic work for OWASP implementing a taint 
mode in Python through a library. Taint mode is a language feature which 
can highlight injection flaws by tracing untrusted user input through the 
code by tracking the ?taintedness? of variables.

You could find the full article here:

Message-ID: <AANLkTikLsOotWx8aSmoCeipPC-N=Kxp9X5uayr=dV7cQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

You are invited to a talk on security for web apps based on SOA, and
related stuff like SaaS and Cloud services. Ideally, the format will
be less of a presentation, and more of a discussion/argument. 11th
August at 6.30pm, Ernst and Young. (might need to register first.
Registration link later, if there is one)

What is Service Oriented Architecture? SOA means different things to
different people. One common meaning is being able to combine
applications or components to give new applications or features.

The key point is that the things being combined might be under
different ownership. This throws up a load of security issues. For a
start, the various systems involved will all have different security
concepts. As ever, there is a trade-off between how much security you
want, and how much flexibility. Some of the solutions are becoming
important these days, as they are used in ?cloud? and SaaS (software
as a service). Federated identity management, in particular.

The first step is to at least understand what the problems are, so
that is what I will focus on in the talk. Between us all, we might
come up with some solutions.

See you there,
JM

Hi John and Others.

Me and few others from my company have been working on a new PHP framework development. It is being designed for business application and SaaS / Web Apps in particular, but it introduces very interesting new ways to data exchange and coding style with cloud services, database, javascript etc. I touched base of our security strategy in my blog post: http://blog.atk4.com/140-security-model/

There are 5 areas of focus:

 1) Web input and output data processing.
 2) JavaScript interaction and data handling.
 3) SQL dynamic language.
 4) Non-Relational database interfaces (SimpleDB, S3, etc)
 5) Front-end and Back-end safe interactions.

If SOA theme is being popular perhaps I could register to talk on one of the further events? I could some plans and ideas we have and discuss how they could help / solve existing security and development issues.

Regards,
Romans
