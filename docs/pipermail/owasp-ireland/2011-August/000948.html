<PRE>Hi All,

Wow, thanks for all the responses.

Federated id (Peter McE). Like a single-sign-on (SSO)? The world would
be a better, more interoperable place if we had one available. I am
toying with the idea of suggesting linking with a public SSO thing.
This would basically mean letting people log in using their Facebook
or Gmail accounts. But, to quote from Father Jack, I think &#8220;that would
be an ecumenical matter&#8221;.

As pointed out by Alexis, choice of solution depends on the context,
like the value or sensitivity of the data. In this case, the level of
sensitivity is not top-of-the-scale (further detail available
off-line).

In terms of a compromise leading to data fraudulently inserted/updated
to the system, we could rely on these fraudulent actions being
remedied later if they can be detected. I think that&#8217;s important,
because in some contexts, actions cannot be undone. Like, in an
application which (let&#8217;s say) launches missiles, it&#8217;s not great to
rely on a fraudulent missile-launch being remedied later.

Two-layer auth, A username/password, followed by a second page asking
for a second password or PIN (Eoin K and Romans M).  This might have
the psychological effect of suggesting the credentials should not be
passed around.

A likely candidate solution might be to detect if a user is logging in
from a new computer (ie Romans thing, or just plaintext persistent
browser cookie). In this case, the user would be verified with a phone
call.

&gt;&gt;<i> (Alexis) What about doing something with mobile phones/SMS?
</I>Interesting. What might this be? Like, requesting a temporary password
via SMS? (In fact, I&#8217;ve got another job going on where this might fit.
In the other project, there is a much larger user population. These
folks rarely log in, so can&#8217;t be expected to maintain a password. But
they mostly have mobile phones)

Anyway, I&#8217;m off surfing for a week in Lahinch, and will duly weigh up
these options between sessions.

thanks again, and full marks for team effort!
JM
