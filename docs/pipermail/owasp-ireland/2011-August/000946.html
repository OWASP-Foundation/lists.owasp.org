<PRE>Hi John,

Client-side SSL certs could turn out to be a bit of a nightmare.
Especially if, as you say, your user base are using a variety of
technologies.
What about doing something with mobile phones/SMS?

You are worried about credentials getting passed around. Preventing the
same user from being logged on twice from two different locations might
be a partial solution.
Training, including dire warnings about sharing credentials might help.

But as we say &quot;it depends&quot; on context/value of data etc....
