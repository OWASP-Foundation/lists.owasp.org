Dear All,

We are planning to deliver a FREE training about the OWASP Live CD around 
April/May (date to be confirmed).

As you might know, this Live CD collects some of the best open source 
security projects in a single environment. 

Web developers, testers and security professionals can boot from this Live 
CD and have access to a full security testing suite.

The idea would be to provide you with a copy of the CD and then go through 
the different tools in an interactive fashion.

You could find more information about the OWASP Live CD here: 
http://appseclive.org/

As there are going to be some costs involved (eg. burning cds, preparing 
materials, etc), we will appreciate if you could support the event either 
by becoming an OWASP individual member or by asking your employer for a 
discretionary donation.

Any help will be really appreciated.

Thank you,

Fabio Cerullo
Divisional Information Security 
Bankcentre D1, 
Ballsbridge,
Dublin 4,
Ireland.

Message-ID: <1269312239.2351.400.camel@matthew-laptop>

Dear OWASP Ireland members and supporters, 

My name is Matthew Hughes and I am currently in my first year of
studying Ethical Hacking for Computer Security at Northumbria
University. I am a dedicated, hard working student with a deep passion
for computer and web application security. 

I am currently approaching the end of my first year, and I am faced with
the daunting prospect of over three months without University or
academic obligations. I want to do something productive in that time,
and therefore I am writing to you to ask if either you or your employer
would have any need for an intern. I'm enthusiastic about enhancing my
skills and getting experience in the field which I hope to make my
career. 

I've got a good work ethic, love the field which I study and I complete
all tasks to the best of my ability. I constantly read in depth about
the subject which I study, the related fields and the issues surrounding
it, and I constantly endeavour to improve my skills. I also have a CV
which I can send upon request.

Many thanks for reading my e-mail, and I look forward to meeting many of
you when I travel to your Ireland for the Live CD training in April/May
and the AppSec conference in September. 

Many thanks, 
Matthew Hughes

Hola Fabio,

Is it the plan going forward to have Owasp events during the day?

I'd like to attend Owasp events but when the event is during the  
working day, it's rarely possible.

Cheers, Mark

I agree with Mark on this, if the events are going to be during the day 
I doubt I will be able to come along to chapter meetings any more.

I would be interested to see what others on the mailing list think.

usually play it by ear closer to the date, after hours might suit most &
increase attendance, though fridays can be catch 22, good turnout for the
last session run during the day...

I agree with Mark on this, if the events are going to be during the day
I doubt I will be able to come along to chapter meetings any more.

I would be interested to see what others on the mailing list think.

We had a full house at the last meeting which ran from 15:00 to 17:30
In my opinion it is free training on OWASP related tools and application
security awareness.
The ISSA, IISF etc hold seminars during the working day also which get good
attendance.

I would suggest you ask your boss to invest in you, and let you go to the
event. I certainly let my team attend which costs us chargeable hours
revenue but is worth it imho.

Hi Eoin,

I appreciate your points and all well made!

However, is it possible to have a compromise (of sorts) because I fear  
that you're missing a sizeable portion of people? It's important to  
get the Owasp message to as many people as possible and I feel that  
flexibility in the meeting schedules would contribute greatly to this.

I realise that for some people 'day' meetings are best but in the  
current economy, many cannot or will not be seen away from their desk.

Let me know what you think.

BRgds, Mark

Just to follow on with a more serious reply than the one I gave earlier, 
for us its not a lack of investing in people or a bad economy. It's the 
opposite really, we have so much work on we can't really afford to have 
the developers and security staff not work 5 hours (leave the office at 
roughly 1pm to get the meeting on time) once per month if that is how 
often the meetings are going to be. If all of our developers and 
security staff came along we would lose 60 hours per meeting and that is 
something we cannot afford to do.

I think it does have a knock on effect like Mark says, if people can't 
come to chapter meetings will they get involved with OWASP at all 
(contributing to projects, attending conferences, spreading the OWASP 
message etc)?

Hi all,

Just to say fair play to Owasp for organising the events that they do

- I know I do appreciate the events especially as I'm only more recently involved with security

And there probably is a need for a mixture of events both during the day and in the evening

Thanks
Niall

Just to follow on with a more serious reply than the one I gave earlier, for us its not a lack of investing in people or a bad economy. It's the opposite really, we have so much work on we can't really afford to have the developers and security staff not work 5 hours (leave the office at roughly 1pm to get the meeting on time) once per month if that is how often the meetings are going to be. If all of our developers and security staff came along we would lose 60 hours per meeting and that is something we cannot afford to do.

I think it does have a knock on effect like Mark says, if people can't come to chapter meetings will they get involved with OWASP at all (contributing to projects, attending conferences, spreading the OWASP message etc)?

Hi guys,

I'm sorry some of you cannot attend the training during the day but 
unfortunately running a 2:30 hours training in the evening it is simply 
impossible.

There are logistics issues and personal commitments from the organizers 
and I imagine some of the attendees as well if we start later in the 
evening.

As Eoin mentions, this is a free training about application security which 
runs on a friday afternoon making it as easy as possible for everyone to 
attend.

We could explore the possibility of running shorter chapter meetings (eg. 
1 hour) later in the evening but for the longer ones I'm afraid it is not 
an option.

If anyone requires further clarifications, please feel free to send an 
email directly to Eoin, Rahim or myself.

Thank you,

Fabio Cerullo
