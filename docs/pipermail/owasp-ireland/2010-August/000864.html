<PRE>Hi there,
I was contacted recently by a friend in the media looking to get an opinion
on the capabilities of a piece of software that is being pimped on the
internet at the moment for a story that he is working on.  Being more of a
generalist, I wasn't able to help him, but thought that I may know where to
ask.

Basically, he is looking for &quot;an expert&quot; that could possible comment on
whether the touted capabilities of a PC download are in fact possible, and
(as I pointed out) if there is anything more going on than there appears to
be (spyware/malware).

I'm reluctant to name names of the guilty on a public list, so hence why I
am being so oblique.  He is not looking for a complete clean-room reverse
engineering of an application, although if that is possible then super.

If anyone on the list working in the anti-virus, anti-spyware/malware
industry that would be prepared to at least talk with us, please contact me
directly.

If the list feels that there is a more appropriate place to raise this
query, then please let me know and accept my apologies.

Cheers
Pete
