Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Dublin Chapter News
Message-ID: <5BE5FB50-75D4-4D13-8ECE-261AB14A4252@owasp.org>

Hi all,

Now that the new year is well under way I wanted to let you know that the team is busy planning chapter meetings and some other events.  Watch this space for more details in the coming weeks. The wiki page will also be updated: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland-Dublin

This year we would like to give all chapter members the opportunity to share their knowledge and expertise. So if you have a topic you would like to present to the group then let us know and we can arrange for you to present at a chapter meeting. This can be a good opportunity to present to a group of like minded people in an informal setting. Even if its something small / short we'd love to hear from you, we usually have more than one talk at a meeting so can arrange multiple short talks for a meeting. Only condition is that you agree to the OWASP speaker agreement which can be found here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement

We are also looking for organisations that might be interested in sponsoring refreshments at chapter meetings. The benefits of this include advertising at the meeting and in promotional material and your logo on our chapter website. Having supporters of meetings means that we can continue to have a social event along with the meetings. This is a great networking opportunity for all. If you think this is something your organisation would be interested in the we'd love to talk to you. 

For more details on becoming a chapter supporter see here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Local_Chapter_Supporter
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Single_Meeting_Supporter

We would also like to thank BCC Risk Advisory who have have recently become OWASP corporate members with an allocation of the funds going to the Dublin chapter.

Looking forward to seeing you at the next meeting,

Fiona, Eoin, Fabio, Darren and Owen

 affect fully patched Macs | Ars Technica
Message-ID: <CAE69ks5Ebf=MXHzAB+UU31ewm6ANgkJZh6S7Tf62OSx9GxhQ6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

A critical iOS vulnerability that Apple patched on Friday gives attackers
an easy way to surreptitiously circumvent the most widely used technology
for preventing eavesdropping on the Internet.

The flaw (one line of code), causes most iOS and Mac applications to skip a
crucial verification check that's supposed to happen when many transport
layer security (TLS) and secure sockets layer (SSL) connections are being
negotiated.

Full article here:

Regards,

Fabio Cerullo

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] MacBook Pro Spec for Pen Testing?
Message-ID: <DUB115-W72F8B8AA12816D49A76EEBD860@phx.gbl>

Hello,

For a number of different reasons, I need to look at getting a MacBook Pro.  Mostly will be used for Appsec/Mobile Appsec (iOS and Android) pen testing .  I'll need to have the ability to run a VM (virtual box - Windows and Kali).  

The 13inch MacBook looks a lot cheaper that a 15inch (with Retina).  I doubt the Retina display will be of much use to me, but the ability to choose up to 16gb does sound useful for VMs.

I'm not that keen on the MacBook Air since it doesn't have a built-in ethernet port, but would be interested to hear if anybody is otherwise happy using a Thunderbolt/Ethernet adapter.

It's been a LONG time since I've used a Mac, so I'd really appreciate any feedback from anybody on what they consider to be decent spec for my purposes.

Cheers,

Leo

Hey Leo,

I've been using Macbook Pros for a few years to do mostly Web App testing
and development. I tend to run a few VMs and sometimes do a lot of resource
intensive tasks (multiple VMs, small password cracking, etc). One thing
I've found is the build quality (hardware) on Macbook Pros is excellent,
much better than any other laptop I've had in the past.

I have the 13" display, which has never been an issue for me, I know some
people who prefer the bigger screen sizes though. Plugging the Macbook into
an external display is also an option if you choose.

I have the i5 version, upgraded with 16GB of RAM and a solid state hard
drive (Samsung SSD 840 EVO 250GB).

I find I'm able to run all of my tools off of it, using 'homebrew' to
install some of them (or their dependencies), other tools I just
compile/install manually. I haven't come across a *nix tool that I needed
that wouldn't run on my Mac I don't think. For Windows only based tools you
can just fire up a VM in Virtualbox.

It took me a couple of months to get used to the OS X operating system, but
it's not too hard to get used to. There are also less malware targeting OS
X (although there are reports that this is growing), so you're less likely
to get infected with non targeted malware. Even so, I do run a virus scan
once in a while, careful what sites I visit, links I click on, etc (common
sense).

I've never had any issues with the Ethernet adapter.

One current topical issue with OS X is the TLS/SSL security "goto fail"
bug, which is pretty embarrassing for them. I'm hoping they have a patch
out for that ASAP.

Ryan
