<PRE>Hi John and Others.

Me and few others from my company have been working on a new PHP framework development. It is being designed for business application and SaaS / Web Apps in particular, but it introduces very interesting new ways to data exchange and coding style with cloud services, database, javascript etc. I touched base of our security strategy in my blog post: <A HREF="http://blog.atk4.com/140-security-model/">http://blog.atk4.com/140-security-model/</A>

There are 5 areas of focus:

 1) Web input and output data processing.
 2) JavaScript interaction and data handling.
 3) SQL dynamic language.
 4) Non-Relational database interfaces (SimpleDB, S3, etc)
 5) Front-end and Back-end safe interactions.

If SOA theme is being popular perhaps I could register to talk on one of the further events? I could some plans and ideas we have and discuss how they could help / solve existing security and development issues.

Regards,
Romans


&gt;<i> Hi Folks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are invited to a talk on security for web apps based on SOA, and
</I>&gt;<i> related stuff like SaaS and Cloud services. Ideally, the format will
</I>&gt;<i> be less of a presentation, and more of a discussion/argument. 11th
</I>&gt;<i> August at 6.30pm, Ernst and Young. (might need to register first.
</I>&gt;<i> Registration link later, if there is one)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is Service Oriented Architecture? SOA means different things to
</I>&gt;<i> different people. One common meaning is being able to combine
</I>&gt;<i> applications or components to give new applications or features.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The key point is that the things being combined might be under
</I>&gt;<i> different ownership. This throws up a load of security issues. For a
</I>&gt;<i> start, the various systems involved will all have different security
</I>&gt;<i> concepts. As ever, there is a trade-off between how much security you
</I>&gt;<i> want, and how much flexibility. Some of the solutions are becoming
</I>&gt;<i> important these days, as they are used in &#8216;cloud&#8217; and SaaS (software
</I>&gt;<i> as a service). Federated identity management, in particular.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first step is to at least understand what the problems are, so
</I>&gt;<i> that is what I will focus on in the talk. Between us all, we might
</I>&gt;<i> come up with some solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See you there,
</I>&gt;<i> JM
</I>&gt;<i>
