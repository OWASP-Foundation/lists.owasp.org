== Talk == Title: Security Implications and Solutions for Web
Applications based on SOA
Abstract:
The main point of SOA (in this context) is combining systems and
applications to make new applications, or a big 'overall' application.

This higher inter-operability does (by default) lower security. For a
start, a request originating from a web user might end up at several
back end systems, which do not know who or what the request came from.

Each back end system might have no access to the customer data, have a
different security models, and serve serveral front end. Each of the
above systems could be under different ownership, thus the owners have
different concerns and priorities. Also, the basic solution at a
technical level include single sign on, or security as a service. This
can be costly, give limited coverage and have a performance hit. But
is pretty much the only way to do it. The other thing to do (probably
in tandem) is strict management, and delegation of authority.

== Presenters ==

John Marmelstein has about 13 years in IT. Most of this in distributed
systems and 'Middleware' integration software. Including BEA (now
owned by Oracle). Mainly working on Enterprise Java and more recently
on Microsoft BizTalk. Various industries, incuding financials, public
services, and a fish farm.&#711;

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page:
