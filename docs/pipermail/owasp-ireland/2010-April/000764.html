This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Ireland chapter meeting to be 
held on April 16th, at 2:30pm-5:00pm (show up at venue between 
2:00pm-2:30pm). 

As usual our location are the Ernst &amp; Young offices in Dublin who kindly 
agreed to host our event:

Dublin, Ireland 

A certificate of participation and a copy of the OWASP Live CD will be 
provided to those attending the event. 

Bringing your own laptop is 'optional' in case you want to tryout the 
OWASP Live CD tools during the training. However, there is no test network 
environment available so all testing will have to be done locally in your 
own laptop. 

This event is completely sold out. If you are no longer able to attend, 
please email us so your space can be released for someone else.

== Talk ==

Title: Trials &amp; Tribulations of WAF Implementation

Abstract: 

A web application firewall (WAF) is an appliance, server plugin, or filter 
that applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation. Generally, these 
rules cover common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL 
Injection. By customizing the rules to your application, many attacks can 
be identified and blocked. The effort to perform this customization can be 
significant and needs to be maintained as the application is modified. 

Mark will be presenting on his experience in implementing a Web 
Application Firewall solution through all phases from research to 
implementation.

== Presenter == 

Mark Hillick - Application Networking Team, Citrix Systems

Mark Hillick has 10 years experience in relation to Internet, networking, 
systems administration and security engineering. 

Mark graduated from Queen's University, where he studied Mathematics. 

Mark joined AIB from Queen's where he joined the Internet Infrastructure 
team, where he was responsible for designing, building and securing the 
Internet service in and out of AIB. He is a prominent member of the IT 
Security community in Ireland and has presented at several local security 
forums such as IISF and Owasp. Mark is one of the founding members of 
IRISS CERT, where he is also a Volunteer Incident Handler. He helped 
organise IRISSCon 2009, where he also designed and built HackEire 2009, 
the first Ethical Hacking  'Capture The Flag' contest in Ireland.

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the 
chapter page (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland</A>). 

** If you would like to be a sponsor of this or a future event please

3. New Educational Supporters

It is with great pleasure that we announce two new OWASP Ireland 
Educational Supporters: 

- Cork Institute of Technology (<A HREF="http://www.cit.ie">http://www.cit.ie</A>)
- Dublin City University (<A HREF="http://www.dcu.ie">http://www.dcu.ie</A>)

This means OWASP Ireland and the educational insitutions could:

- collectively organize chapter meetings if required.
- jointly publicize season of code events which provide funding for 
students or faculty to perform security based research. 
- work together to host security seminars or provide introductory training 
sessions for students on OWASP tools, documentation, etc. 

Please join me in welcoming them to the OWASP Ireland Community!
