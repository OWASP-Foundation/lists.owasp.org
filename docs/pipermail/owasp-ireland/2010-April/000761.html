1. OWASP Live CD Training

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Ireland chapter meeting to be 
held on April 16th, at 2:30pm-5:00pm (show up at venue between 
2:00pm-2:30pm).

As usual our location are the Ernst &amp; Young offices in Dublin who kindly 
agreed to host our event:
- Ernst &amp; Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon Pub, 
Dublin, Ireland

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at 
<A HREF="http://owasp-ireland-livecd.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-ireland-livecd.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real 
name, as this will be given to Ernst &amp; Young building security. If you 
don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs 
close midday the day of the event (so we can get names on the door), so 
make sure you RSVP in advance.

A certificate of participation and a copy of the OWASP Live CD will be 
provided to those attending the event. 

Bringing your own laptop is 'optional' in case you want to tryout the 
OWASP Live CD tools during the training. However, there is no test network 
environment available so all testing will have to be done locally in your 
own laptop.

Further details and schedule for the night are available on the chapter 
page ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland</A> )

** If you would like to be a sponsor of this or a future event please 
contact me directly at 087-7817468 for details.

2. OWASP Training Sessions / Chapter Meetings

Based on your feedback we are planning to organize the chapter 
meetings/training sessions in the following manner for 2010:

- short presentations (1 hour): these will be held in the evenings around 
6pm.
- long presentations (2+ hours): these will be held in the afternoons 
around 3pm.

Both formats will be streamed (when possible), recorded and posted online 
for later consultation in case you cannot attend personally.

We are always actively looking for speakers, so if you have a topic you 
would like to present please contact Eoin, Rahim or myself.
