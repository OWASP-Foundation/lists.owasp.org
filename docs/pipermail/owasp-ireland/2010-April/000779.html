== Talk ==

Title: Trials &amp; Tribulations of WAF Implementation

Abstract: 

A web application firewall (WAF) is an appliance, server plugin, or filter 
that applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation. Generally, these 
rules cover common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL 
Injection. By customizing the rules to your application, many attacks can 
be identified and blocked. The effort to perform this customization can be 
significant and needs to be maintained as the application is modified. 

Mark will be presenting on his experience in implementing a Web 
Application Firewall solution through all phases from research to 
implementation.

== Presenter == 

Mark Hillick - Application Networking Team, Citrix Systems

Mark Hillick has 10 years experience in relation to Internet, networking, 
systems administration and security engineering. 

Mark graduated from Queen's University, where he studied Mathematics. 

Mark joined AIB from Queen's where he joined the Internet Infrastructure 
team, where he was responsible for designing, building and securing the 
Internet service in and out of AIB. He is a prominent member of the IT 
Security community in Ireland and has presented at several local security

IRISS CERT, where he is also a Volunteer Incident Handler. He helped
