Subject: [Owasp-ireland] WASPY Award - Eoin Keary
Message-ID: <CAE2kEQR6ku1UmW1pp1+Lu0=HShey13fBDOyYszvt4kNL_wQK6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm happy to say that our own Eoin Keary won the Waspy Award for the
Open/Leading (Europe) category.

*Open/Leading* - Everything at OWASP is radically transparent ? from our
finances to our code. This award goes to a member of the OWASP community
who has supported the OWASP mission of transparency through their
influence, management, and leadership in the community. This might be a
chapter or project leader or may be someone who has worked within the
community.

This was for Eoin's open approach to sharing knowledge, delivery of free
training across Europe & the globe and his constant vigilance in protecting
the values of the OWASP foundation over the past 10 years.

Congrats Eoin!

Rahim

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures
allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about
application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company,
although we support the informed use of commercial security technology.
Similar to many open-source software projects, OWASP produces many types of
materials in a collaborative and open way. The OWASP Foundation is a
not-for-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success.

I've taken a look at the website and the talk descriptions are still
pending for all the talks. There also seems to be a lot of speakers TBC;
does anyone know if this information will be available soon? Thanks!

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] WASPY Award - Fiona Collins
Message-ID: <CACH=f5btj-L8782jPmofj7xsM9AyPROnUN1iwthkaS9ToxDEiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,


Further to the previous mail in relation Eoin Keary receiving a WASPY
award, I?d like to congratulate Fiona Collins chapter lead in Cork on
receiving a WASPY award for Innovation/Sharing Category for the European
Region.


https://www.owasp.org/index.php/WASPY_Awards_2015


Fiona has given talks and classes at APPSECEU and has also promoted appsec
throughout Ireland for many years. She has done a great job, and with Cork,
having a small chapter she has grown it massively.


Well done Fiona, well deserved.
