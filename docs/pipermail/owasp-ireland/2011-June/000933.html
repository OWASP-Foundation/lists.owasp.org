<PRE>Hi Brian,
ASVS is a great start as the OWASP Top 10 was never and is not a standard
but a survey with lots of great data and remediation hanging off of it.
The OWASP Testing guide may help with you developing an approach. Many
approaches are not shared as they are considered internal information.
Last time I looked metasploit is not a pure web app sec tool but rather a
exploit tool with some nice auxillary scanners etc.

Burp Proxy and Zap are very common web proxies used in industry today
coupled with commercial tools such as IBM Appscan, HP Webinspect or Cenzic
hailstorm not to forget Netsparker but to name a few.

The more mature approach is secure coding, development process and code
review coupled with runtime testing.
Industry is realising that a pen test alone is not enough as it does not
cover all aspects.

Also the idea of scanning for known vulnerabilities vs fault injection these
are different concepts.
Many free/Open source tools do not do &quot;known vulnerabilities&quot; as well if at
all as this requires constant rule base updating as new issues are
discovered and the developers focus on improving accuracy of the result
parsing and injection rather than making new rules to reproduce an exploit.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm doing a practicum for my course in DCU on the area of penetration
</I>&gt;<i> testing for web applications. I thought this would be a good place to tell
</I>&gt;<i> about it since it concerns web application security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I plan to investigate and examine the current tools/frameworks available to
</I>&gt;<i> pen-testers out now, and their effectiveness in sample tests against some
</I>&gt;<i> web services. Right now, I have the sample Hacme services available from
</I>&gt;<i> Foundstone ( <A HREF="http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/index.aspx">http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/index.aspx</A> ).
</I>&gt;<i> Since these are intentionally filled with potential exploits, they are the
</I>&gt;<i> best web services to test these tools on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I plan to do is the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Develop my own process for penetration testing. From my research I do
</I>&gt;<i> not see a standard approach to this. I am currently going through and plan
</I>&gt;<i> to use some aspects of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard
</I>&gt;<i> in this, as well as the OWASP Top 10 in my attempt to develop an approach to
</I>&gt;<i> testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Test these sample web services with two tools, w3af and Metasploit Pro.
</I>&gt;<i> W3af ( <A HREF="http://w3af.sourceforge.net/">http://w3af.sourceforge.net/</A> ) is open source tool, while
</I>&gt;<i> Metasploit Pro ( <A HREF="http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit-pro.jsp">http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit-pro.jsp</A> ) is a
</I>&gt;<i> commercial tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Test the web services using the approach I developed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Compare the results of all 3 methods used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the process of this I will be researching and studying everything
</I>&gt;<i> security related for web applications so I should come out the other end
</I>&gt;<i> with some good knowledge of web app exploits, how to run a pentest
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything obvious that I am missing that should be in a study of
</I>&gt;<i> penetration testing of web applications and its available tools?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would anyone be interested in the results from this investigation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
