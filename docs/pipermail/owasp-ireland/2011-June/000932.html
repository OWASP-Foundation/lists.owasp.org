<PRE>Hi,

I'm doing a practicum for my course in DCU on the area of penetration
testing for web applications. I thought this would be a good place to tell
about it since it concerns web application security.

I plan to investigate and examine the current tools/frameworks available to
pen-testers out now, and their effectiveness in sample tests against some
web services. Right now, I have the sample Hacme services available from
Foundstone ( <A HREF="http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/index.aspx">http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/index.aspx</A> ).
Since these are intentionally filled with potential exploits, they are the
best web services to test these tools on.

What I plan to do is the following:

1. Develop my own process for penetration testing. From my research I do not
see a standard approach to this. I am currently going through and plan to
use some aspects of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard in
this, as well as the OWASP Top 10 in my attempt to develop an approach to
testing.

2. Test these sample web services with two tools, w3af and Metasploit Pro.
W3af ( <A HREF="http://w3af.sourceforge.net/">http://w3af.sourceforge.net/</A> ) is open source tool, while Metasploit
Pro ( <A HREF="http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit-pro.jsp">http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit-pro.jsp</A> ) is a commercial
tool.

3. Test the web services using the approach I developed.

4. Compare the results of all 3 methods used.

During the process of this I will be researching and studying everything
security related for web applications so I should come out the other end
with some good knowledge of web app exploits, how to run a pentest

Is there anything obvious that I am missing that should be in a study of
penetration testing of web applications and its available tools?

Would anyone be interested in the results from this investigation?

Thanks,

Brian
