Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] A Chronology of Data Breaches (USA)
Message-ID: <003901c628a8$17d50110$0e00000a@RITSPROD>


Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has a list of data breaches which have occurred over the last year in the USA in which personal information has been compromised. Currently the total number is at 52,557,249.....and that's in one year. 

http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm

As they say "The catalyst for reporting data breaches to the affected individuals has been the California law that requires notice of security breaches" and now it's a "nationwide" practice. 

I wonder would similar legislation in Europe/Ireland produce equivalent numbers.

Yep,
sounds to me like a certain element of  recon/statistical gathering :0)

Thing is, do application firewalls or client side security look for 
malicious data in comments or should they?

   Install yourself and wait for instructions. Ill bet whats in between 
the comment tags are base64 encoded execution commands, or similar. This

hits on his site being a count of how many machines are at his disposal.

I actually think that's a pretty good idea.  As we know by now, it's only a matter of when this attack works in the wild, so maybe we should recommend this as an initial response until we get a clearer picture!

Hmm, 
     Install yourself and wait for instructions. Ill bet whats in between the   comment tags are base64 encoded execution commands, or similar. This is   somebody setting up a zombie network possibly for sale. The number of hits on   his site being a count of how many machines are at his disposal. Neat.

Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] HTML malware
Message-ID: <BBB9FA5E1514D511A88D00B0D0AA8EA60BC59D14@ntdub1e.trintech.com>

Removing comments with an app firewall would be a quick-fix solution.

Longer term, an amended version of the malware could parse content/payload
that could be inserted anywhere in the html (or for example associated
images) i.e. not in the comments or the first 64 bytes (and still be
invisible to the end user and any html scanner). 

If the malware used steganography then it would be very difficult to limit
the malware by filtering its content/payload.
