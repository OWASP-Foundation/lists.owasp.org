Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Code Review Book (RC1) and Enterprise Security API
Message-ID: <f3193c100711220836l272b683cp768b723e75ca2cf6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

More evolution in the realm of open source free security. and the geeks
shall inherit the earth...."

Firstly OWASP has released an API for secure code development  called the
Enterprise Security API. It contains solutions to help one develop in a
secure manner.
The API has been code reviewed by a number of resources and is considered
*very* secure :)
It can be found here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI

Also for those of you who don't know,
much of the owasp material can be purchased in "real" book format.  Its
actually real cheap for Eurozone people as the dollar is so weak.
worth checking out here:

(Draft)

The code review guide is also available as a wiki:
