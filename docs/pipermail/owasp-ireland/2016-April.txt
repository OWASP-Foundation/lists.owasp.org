Hey Owen,

I would like to get involved more in OWASP. If that means being part of the 
board or not I don't mind. I would have a different perspective than 
most people in OWASP as I'm a Software Developer, if you're looking for somebody different.

Regards,
Myles

Thanks Myles,

Really appreciate your response.

We will compile a list of all who responded and get back to everyone. I
think the amount of interest is great and shows how active the community is
and wants to be in Dublin.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Dublin Chapter Meeting Summary
Message-ID: <CAEZOdogmeA-=gd5nfVbmZOndnQ1ce21ra_jKg+yio2d818F3JQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Many thanks to all who came and participated at the Dublin Chapter meeting
yesterday, we hope you found it interesting. Thanks again to all the
speakers and sponsors particularly, Morgan McKinley, E&Y, BCC Risk
Advisory/Edgescan, PwC, IBM Security team & Ward Solutions. We very much
appreciate the support and your involvement in the OWASP community.

We had about 80 people at the meeting and below is a summary for anyone who
couldn't attend.

*Session 1*
Hugh Jones from Sytorus <http://www.sytorus.com/> gave a very insightful
presentation on ?Data Protection Officer?s - Overview of the GDPR?. Which
included the new principles and the implications for Data Controllers and
Data Processors.

The presentation can be found here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland-Dublin

*Session 2*
This session took a panel format and included the following experts:

   - Hugh Callaghan - Director of Financial Services Advisory at EY
   <http://www.ey.com/IE/en/Services/Advisory/Risk/Information-Security>;
   - Rahim Jina - Director at BCC Risk Advisory
   <http://www.bccriskadvisory.com/>;
   - Dara Boland  - Principal Consultant at Morgan McKinley
   <http://www.morganmckinley.ie/>;
   - Jason Flood  - CTO at IBM <http://www.ibm.com/ie-en/>;
   - Leonard McAuliffe - Director of Cyber Security and Forensics at PwC
   <http://www.pwc.ie/services/consulting/information-security-cybercrime.html>;
   and
   - Declan Timmons - Principal Security Consultant at Ward Solutions
   <http://www.ward.ie/>.

The panel gave their insights on working in the IT & Information Security
and took questions from the audience which sparked some interesting debate.
Some of the discussion points included:

   - The security market as a whole and how the supply of IT security
   candidates is not currently meeting the demand;
   - How to move into IT security, where the panel outlined they are
   looking for smart, enthusiastic and proactive individuals. There was advice
   from the panel to demonstrate enthusiasm by contributing to the security
   community and projects and gaining skills in your own time.  Other advice
   included proactively contacting security leaders in organisations you wish
   to work with via social media instead of waiting for roles to be advertised;
   - The panel discussed how job specs are developed internally and that
   not everything is always mandatory and encouraged people to apply for roles
   even if they don?t meet all the criteria;
   - The panel discussed how having practical industry experience is of
   benefit when providing realistic recommendations to clients as opposed
   having a pure text book view of security;
   - We spoke about certifications and how they can be utilised in the
   absence of experience to get a ?foot in the door? and to tailor your
   certifications to the area of security you wish to work in;
   - Advice for individuals looking to move into IT security from other
   roles, which included the recommendation that they should use their
   existing skills as a selling point;
   - The audience and panel agreed that there was a need for more females
   to become involved in IT security so that security teams are more diverse
   and provide different perspectives in terms of problem solving and
   innovation. There was good advice from the audience and panel around
   removing barriers to applying for roles, it was suggested that language
   such as ?desirable? and ?preferred but not required? should be considered
   in job specs;
   - The panel spoke about the role educational institutions play in the
   security market and there was general consensus that an imbalance currently
   existed between security and forensics elements in most higher level
   courses and that forensics should play a smaller role in courses;
   - Advice for graduates applying for roles was to ensure that they could
   speak at length on their project and use this as a differentiator when
   interviewing.
   - The was also advice for individuals moving from other disciplines and
   it was suggested that they play to their strengths and use their existing
   skill sets when applying for roles and also in education when selecting a
   project and to utilise their experience from another disciple coupled with
   a security slant;

Pizza, beer and refreshments were provided by our generous hosts Morgan
McKinley.

We?d encourage everyone to continue the debate or ask questions on the
OWASP list and let us know what you thought of the sessions.

Feel free to respond to the open call for board members and volunteers and
thanks to everyone who has expressed an interest so far.

Many Thanks,

Tony.

Hello everyone,

Over the past couple of months we the Dublin board have been working on improving our reach within the community. We have noted that in order to do this the board as a group need to be more involved in promoting OWASP's mission.

To this end, two of our long serving board members Fabio Cerullo and Mark Denihan have decided to step down and allow others within the community get involved. We would like to thank them for their volunteer efforts and hope they can be still involved in some capacity for years to come.

We would like to take this opportunity to ask those interested in becoming part of the OWASP board to help drive OWASP within the local community to step forward and contact myself, Eoin Keary and Tony Clarke.

We're particularly interested in ensuring gender equality and would encourage female members of the community to get in contact and would also encourage individuals from outside pure application security such as individuals with a development or infrastructure background to become more involved.

We would also welcome others who would like to assist the OWASP Dublin chapter in other capacity with organising events or other outreach activities.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Everyone,

We're happy to announce that we will be hosting the next OWASP Dublin
chapter event in the Morgan McKinley?s <https://www.morganmckinley.ie/>
office on Wednesday April 27th 2016 at 6:30pm and will be focused on
DevOps. Please feel free to forward the event to friends and colleagues.

Please use the eventbrite link below to register:
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-april-event-devops-tickets-24574522057

We're hoping to have some gifts to give away as part of the night.

*Session 1 - John Turner - Monkey Little*

John Turner has been developing software in the financial and betting
industry since 1999. He has a huge interest in the changing ways in which
software projects are being delivered. This has led John to discover, learn
and apply the practices and principles fundamental to Agile software
development particularly those of Scrum and Lean. More recently John spends
his time identifying how best to leverage the emergence of Cloud (IAAS,
PAAS, SAAS) to create more Agile businesses.

John's session will focus on "DevOps Adoption Patterns". While DevOps is
still riding high on a peak of inflated expectations, a number of patterns
of adoption are starting to emerge. The conceptual definition of Agile made
it difficult to embrace until frameworks such as Scrum became popular. In
this same way, the theoretical and visionary definition of DevOps is
creating a barrier to entry for those eager to realise its benefits. Fear
not, for there are brave soles who have gone before us that we can strive
to emulate!  Join us to talk about some of the ways in which people are
'doing DevOps?.

*Session 2 - Noel King - VSWare *

Noel is VP for Engineering at VSWare an Irish Software company which
provides a cloud based administration system to the education sector.  He
has led and developed software solutions across multiple sectors and is
focused on driving excellence through team orientated development utilising
the best industry standards. He has a passion for quality assurance,
development automation, continuous delivery and leveraging cloud to get
your product to market quicker.

He spends his free time volunteering with CoderDojo, mentoring the
technology innovators of the future, building cool and fun course material
and promoting the ideology.  Passionate about education and inspiring the
next generation he created CoderDojo Coolest Projects Awards.  The Coolest
Projects is now Ireland's largest tech event that focuses on creativity
takes place annually in Dublin and Silicon Valley.

Noel's session is entitled "Banishing Snakes from Green Field Development".

*Session 3 - Ryan Sudding - VMware*

Ryan works for VMware as a Systems Engineer. He has spent the last number
of years working as an Infrastructure Consultant, but more recently has
spent more time working with the VMware Network and Security Business Unit.
He loves cars, travel and spending time with his wife and 11 month old
daughter.

Ryan's session will be primarily focused on the current security landscape
and also will also try debunk a few security myths.


Looking forward to seeing you there.

Thanks,

Tony.

industry. We're very exited to have the guests below who will speak on the
topic and give their insights.

Please feel free to forward the event to friends and colleagues.
