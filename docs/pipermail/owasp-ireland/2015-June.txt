Hello Chapter,

I was considering delivering a free half day secure application development workshop in July. 

This would be open to all OWASP members and non members can join OWASP (?50) to attend also.

The class would be similar to the class I've previously delivered with Jim Manico (@manicode) at RSA USA, RSA EU, AppsecEu etc.

It is suitable for development types who would like a grounding in secure Dev and also pentesters who need a refresher.
So send your devs to the class!

Beer and pizza shall also be provided by sponsors / chapter funds if possible.

Any takers?

Hi,
I'm afraid we can't do everything in 3-4 hours. We can cover off a piece on CI / agile SAST and sprint-based security if that works? I'd like to cover off 
XSS
CSRF
SQLI
CRYPTO
CLICKJACKING
HTTP HEADERS
SDLC/CI/AGILE

Hello Eoin,

I know you can't accommodate all requests but as you are asking for
feedbacks .. here I'am :P

If there will be an its own class focused only on SDLC/CI/AGILE it would be
nice.

In alternative could you have a little break between: XSS, CSRL ... HTTP
HEADERS and SDLC/CI/AGILE  ?
I would like to attend the last part but not the first part.

Do you also have an idea about the 'when' ?

Many Thanks,

R.
