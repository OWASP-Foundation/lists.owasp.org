Hi there,
At last we have a new location for chapter meetings.

Can anyone interested in attending the OWASP Ireland chapter meeting in 
mid June in Dublin drop me a line??
Agenda is:
A few presentations, 
One on webservices security from a world renowned XML security vendor.
Another on actual insider threats in the modern office, pretty cool stuff.

A call for any bright ideas anyone has that OWASP could implement.

Currently we are trying to interface with Irish universities to get an 
army of developers to code app security tools.
- anybody interested in getting involved, drop me a line or give me a 
call.

After that, a few pints?
Come along, and bring your friends, enemies and pets!

CISSP's, for every hour of attendance at an OWASP meeting counts as one 
CPE credit !!

Hi,
below are links for a MS resource which seems to be fairly "Hot" at the 
moment.
It covers patterns and practices for application development and also has 
a security section also.
There is also a wiki which one can contribute to, which is nice.

1.
An interesting document from Watchfire (from AppScan fame) which explains 
a type of attach called HTTP Smuggling.
HTTP smuggling is in effect placing more than one HTTP request in a single 
HTTP request??!!*#
The different parsing methods of various devices on a network (Firewall 
HTTP server, Appserver) cause discrepancies which can be taken advantage 
of.

http://www.watchfire.com/resources/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf


2.(Please Read)
"To maintain your OWASP membership one must attend at least one meeting 
every three months. This has been decided due to the lack of contribution, 
and involvement by chapter members."
If you cant attend any OWASP chapter meetings drop me a line and tell me 
why. If you don't wish to attend any OWASP chapter meetings please remove 
yourself from the list.
- In my opinion involvement with OWASP has been great. We get to define 
industry and best practice standards. Companies like SPIDynamics, TEROS, 
FoundStone, WatchFire, Security Innovation  and the FTC have adopted the 
OWASP top ten and use OWASP in their marketing media. 
If you are a security professional, active involvement in OWASP is great 
fro your CV and also other OWASP members can be used for references.

Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] Web services - DV Auth or Auth DV???
Message-ID: <E1DfvZl-0006R8-DC@sc8-sf-mx2.sourceforge.net>

Hello All,
(first posting from a 'top ten' adopter)

I suggest that authentication is the one to do first. But, there are arguments on both sides. The advantage of authentication is that it can reduce the risk of malicious data attack. An attacker may send a payload aimed at doing damage during the xml parsing or data-validation utility (DV). I know that the DV is made with the intention of being resistant to this, but complex messages might be hard to validate safely. This is in contrast to messages received from html forms, which can be safely validated if they are all text strings.

Going further, there's a case for splitting the validation process. First, a 'sanity check' on the message. Then, authenticate. Finally, proper validation. For example; 
1- Check that is valid XML or SOAP. Maybe some broadly application-specific stuff, such as checking that the message only has text elements, no non-parse 'CDATA' bits. Or, that it is smaller than a certain size. 
2- Authenticate username/password
3- Application-specific data validation.
This may sound over-elaborate, but I don't think it's too bad. A typical environment might have a dedicated web-server (Apache, perhaps) in front of an Application Server (WebLogic, perhaps). The 'step 1' above could be efficiently done in the Apache, and a category of bad messages blocked within the DMZ. The same basic sanity check should work for many or all applications. Then again, this step can also be done by many firewall products, so may not be worth getting into.

bye,
John M

Hi John,
I was chatting to Dr Tony Palmer of Vordel about this last week.
The first thing from the point of not doing any extra CPU time for 
unauthenticated requests to the authenticate.
One solution is not to have the UserId and password "In band", inside the 
SOAP message so we auth then DV. Use Out of Band credentials (in the HTTP 
request as opposed to the XML message)

Using a SAX parser instead of a DOM to do  initial parsing would also help 
performance.
Some of the Vordel suite of solutions can actually talk to the firewall to 
block suspected rogue requests.

An XML schema on both sides of the transaction is also a good idea if 
possible, but it cant be guaranteed that the requesting  entity shall use 
the schema to validate their request and can not be relied on in its 
entirety.

Anyways, We (Ireland OWASP) hope to have Dr Palmer (or one of his 
colleagues) give us a presentation on Webservices security at the next 
OWASP meeting.

Eoin et al.
    Thanks for the mention. At Vordel we would recommend that bad
messages should be blocked as soon as possible and with the minimum
amount of CPU cycles / network usage. And of course logged.
 
We note that when authentication is performed first, the likelihood that
a message will fail content validation is drastically reduced. Clients
that authenticate successfully should not be intentionally sending bad
XML. (Otherwise you are doing business with shady people and you will
not be around for long anyway.) For  XML and Web Services most traffic
is machine to machine, authentication or content validation errors are
usually due to misconfiguration and easily rectified.
 
Now this becomes moot if a valid login is obtained illegally. In the
event of an attack you would expect to see multiple errors such as
Authorization failures, Content Validation etc. Eoin is correct in that
Vordel can be configured to alert such anomalous behaviour to a firewall
and block subsequent attacks at the network level.
 
To prevent the attacker gaining a valid login by sniffing we recommend
the usage of SSL. If you restrict certain services to a subset of your
customer base then IP filtering at the application (XML Firewall) layer
can prevent users accessing services from unknown locations, even if
they obtain a valid login. We see this quite frequently, whilst the XML
firewall is publicly addressable individual services are dedicated to a
small number of high usage clients. e.g.  Banks connecting to a Telco.
 
Now there is the issue that John seems to have happened upon that seems
worthy of a mention. His system gives different errors depending on the
security check that fails. Vordel acknowledges that whilst custom error
responses are handy when developing a system they have no place in
secure production systems. Vordel recommends that a standard error
response is sent such as 'Request Denied'. You should never give an
attacker hints.
 
Once XML systems are up and running *any* security processing errors are
a noteworthy event worth checking out.

Hi John, 
I was chatting to Dr Tony Palmer of Vordel about this last week. 
The first thing from the point of not doing any extra CPU time for
unauthenticated requests to the authenticate. 
One solution is not to have the UserId and password "In band", inside
the SOAP message so we auth then DV. Use Out of Band credentials (in the
HTTP request as opposed to the XML message) 

Using a SAX parser instead of a DOM to do  initial parsing would also
help performance. 
Some of the Vordel suite of solutions can actually talk to the firewall
to block suspected rogue requests. 

An XML schema on both sides of the transaction is also a good idea if
possible, but it cant be guaranteed that the requesting  entity shall
use the schema to validate their request and can not be relied on in its
entirety. 

Anyways, We (Ireland OWASP) hope to have Dr Palmer (or one of his
colleagues) give us a presentation on Webservices security at the next
OWASP meeting.

Re: [OWASP-Ireland] Web services - DV Auth or Auth DV???

	





Hello All,
(first posting from a 'top ten' adopter)

I suggest that authentication is the one to do first. But, there are
arguments on both sides. The advantage of authentication is that it can
reduce the risk of malicious data attack. An attacker may send a payload
aimed at doing damage during the xml parsing or data-validation utility
(DV). I know that the DV is made with the intention of being resistant
to this, but complex messages might be hard to validate safely. This is
in contrast to messages received from html forms, which can be safely
validated if they are all text strings.

Going further, there's a case for splitting the validation process.
First, a 'sanity check' on the message. Then, authenticate. Finally,
proper validation. For example; 
1- Check that is valid XML or SOAP. Maybe some broadly
application-specific stuff, such as checking that the message only has
text elements, no non-parse 'CDATA' bits. Or, that it is smaller than a
certain size. 
2- Authenticate username/password
3- Application-specific data validation.
This may sound over-elaborate, but I don't think it's too bad. A typical
environment might have a dedicated web-server (Apache, perhaps) in front
of an Application Server (WebLogic, perhaps). The 'step 1' above could
be efficiently done in the Apache, and a category of bad messages
blocked within the DMZ. The same basic sanity check should work for many
or all applications. Then again, this step can also be done by many
firewall products, so may not be worth getting into.

bye,
John M

Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] Fw: OWASP 2.0 beta 1 available for public comment
Message-ID: <OF9131FEED.FFBC1359-ON00257021.00582DF2-00257021.00582356@allianz.ie>

FYI:




Hi there,

The OWASP Guide 2.0 is due for release at Black Hat this year, and as such
we have to finish it sometime soon. As part of that process, I am
encouraging extremely robust debate and public comments. We want to make
sure that the Guide 2.0 will be a handy compendium for a little while.

The OWASP Guide 2.0 beta 1 available for download from Sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=62287&release_id=333866


PDF (1.5 MB)
MD5 (Guide2.0b1.pdf) = f455497c56c561043d4fdc5d13188064

Microsoft Word (545 kB compressed)
MD5 (Guide2.0b1.doc.zip) = ad6b3bedba4f30ac8aefd0e9feffd401

(Despite its size, the document is actually very structurally simple. I've
tested this with OpenOffice 1.1.2 on my Mac, and it opens fine, so feel
free to use that if you're not a MS fan)

If you have comments, please download the Word version, and mark that up
using Tracking Changes and the "comments" feature built into the reviewing
pane.  I can also view Acrobat comments, but prefer the Word version as
that's the native format.

Release Notes:

* It's not finished. Please don't tell me that :)

* Some sections are in a state of extreme flux. I'm happy to take comments
on chapters that seem in disrepair (such as the Session Management
chapter)

* Please avoid commenting on the data validation chapter as it's being
re-written from the ground up.

Please e-mail your comments directly to me with "OWASP Guide" in the 
subject.

Thanks,
Andrew

Attacked was traced to a "Trusted client" which processes transactions 
from banks and merchants.
Maybe this will put context on the "We trust those guys" mentality in B2B 
transaction architecture decisions?

Analysis and Detection of Malicious Insiders

Abstract

This paper summarizes a collaborative, six month ARDA NRRC1 challenge
workshop to characterize and create analysis methods to counter
sophisticated malicious insiders in the United States Intelligence
Community. Based upon a careful study of past and projected cases, we report
a generic model of malicious insider behaviors, distinguishing motives,
(cyber and organizaphysical) actions, and associated observables. The paper
outlines several prototype techniques developed to provide early warning of
insider activity, including novel algorithms for structured analysis and
data fusion. We report the assessment of their performance in an operational
network against three distinct classes of human insiders (an analyst,
application administrator, and system administrator), measuring timeliness
and accuracy of detection.

Message-ID: <BAY18-F20A808F2AC898809F7FF43A6EA0@phx.gbl>

The Irish chapter meeting was held last night in Dublin.
I believe everyone got something out of it.

Three presentations were given:
OWASP Introduction - Me
Web Services Security - Dr Tony Palmer (Vordel.com)
Insider Threats - Myles Gallagher (ISSA)

Attendance was ok, about 40% but hopefully this shall grow in time.

We have agreed to establish a "Wish List" of what to present at the next 
meeting which shall be posted on the chapter page.

Respect to Dr Palmer and Myles for such good presentations and to Yann 
Laprade for assistance.

Thanks to everyone that turned up to help make the chapter work.

regards,
Eoin
