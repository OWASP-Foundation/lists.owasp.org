"The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard"

<http://webmail.namezero.com/horde/util/go.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sans.or
g%2Fwebcasts%2Fshow.php%3Fwebcastid%3D90656&Horde=509b2eacd204784b01364c547f
4d2341> 
Sponsored by SenSage

 

Free (may require free registration)

Open to all.

The PCI Data Security Standard is a compliance initiative from
the payment card industry that dictates best-practice security
standards for service providers and merchants who handle credit card
information. The standard involves on-site audits, self-administered
audits, and network scanning, not all of which apply to everyone. This
presentation will provide an overview of what the standard is, who
it applies to and in what ways, and what organizations are doing to
be compliant with each component of the standard.

Dave Shackleford is a Senior Security Architect for Vigilar in Atlanta,
providing information security consulting services to business and
government clients. Dave has been involved in security for close to
10 years, holding a number of technical and managerial positions. Dave
is also the co-author of "Hands-On Information Security" from Thomson
Course Technology.

Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] Technical explanation of the MySpace worm

If you haven't heard of the MySpace worm, read this first:

http://www.betanews.com/article/CrossSite_Scripting_Worm_Hits_MySpace/1129232391


Now, although the above is fairly technical, I came across this the other day, written by the author himself:

http://namb.la/popular/tech.html

Anyone interested in cross-site scripting should read the full article; it makes fascinating and fun reading. It's also a very interesting lesson on the pitfalls of 'enumerating badness'.

From: jeff.williams at owasp.org (Jeff Williams)
Date: Tue, 1 Nov 2005 15:34:54 -0500
Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] [Owasp-world] Welcome to OWASP
Message-ID: <020f01c5df23$b7ea1d30$4301a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Hello everyone,

 

You're receiving this message because you are subscribed to one or more Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP) mailing lists (http://www.owasp.org
<http://www.owasp.org/> ). OWASP-WORLD is a low-volume mailing list reserved
for important events and announcements of interest to everyone in the OWASP
community.

  
1) Basic Philosophy: OWASP's mission is to find and fight the causes of
application vulnerabilities. These span organizational issues, people
issues, process issues, and technology issues. OWASP encourages the informed
use of application security technologies while being critical of excessive
vendor claims.  Note that OWASP does not focus on network or infrastructure
security issues, as the application layer has its own unique issues,
techniques, and technologies.



2) History: OWASP is an open source project started in 2000. The OWASP
Foundation was established as a 501c3 not-for-profit in 2003 and currently
we have thousands of participants around the world.  Our website receives
millions of hits every month and our work (tools and documentation) is used
by many corporations and agencies around the world.  We also have over 50
local chapters working to spread knowledge of application security.  Please
take a minute to explore the website to see the projects and chapters there.
 
3) Organization: OWASP does all of its work in the open, and everything is
available under one of the open source licenses. We operate on a shoestring
budget and rely on dedicated individuals for just about everything. We've
recently started a membership program so that organizations that benefit
from the work done by the OWASP community can support our mission.



You may be interested in the presentations from the most recent OWASP
conference at NIST.  They are available on the OWASP website at
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc/schedule.html.  All of the
presentations were videotaped and will be made available for viewing online
soon.

 

Thank you all for your support of OWASP.

 

--Jeff
