Hi folks,

The OWASP, IISF, ISACA, ISC2 social event is on next week.

https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/joint-isc2-iisf-owasp-isaca-community-bbq-dublin-tickets-17613841474

It's booked out but has a waiting list.
Details are on the link above.
It should be a great opportunity to meet people from other security walks of life and network also, if that's your thing!!

Hope to see you there!

Message-ID: <CAGG7GgzX6GA1P1dxqM_Hi3WzQDj38ENVUrRoSqEAg_c9Hm13Cw@mail.gmail.com>

We are reaching out to a number of chapters who have posted presentations
to the OWASP wiki that appear to violate our branding rules. All
presentations given at chapter meetings or at conferences when representing
OWASP, and those posted to wiki pages must be vendor neutral. This includes
the content of the presentation as well as the graphics used in the
presentation layout. Any non-OWASP branded material, such as a speaker's
corporate logo, must be removed from the presentation. Exceptions may exist
such as when the context of a slide calls for a logo as an illustration. I
am happy to review anything that might be questionable.

There are a number of slide decks posted to the OWASP Ireland page that
have corporate logos as part of the presentation layout. These logos need
to be removed before reposting the presentations to the chapter wiki. We
are working with chapter leaders to ensure that all chapter and project
wiki pages are compliant.

When creating a new presentation, please be sure to use either a blank
presentation template or one of the OWASP branded templates.

You can download OWASP presentation templates here:
https://www.owasp.org/images/3/3f/PPT_2015_Toolbox.zip (optimized for 16:9
screens)
https://www.owasp.org/images/5/5d/PPT_2013_Toolbox.zip (optimized for
standard 4:3 screens)

Vendor neutrality is a key value of OWASP and important in maintaining the
OWASP Foundation's status as a nonprofit. Your understanding (and continued
participation) is appreciated.

Thank you.
