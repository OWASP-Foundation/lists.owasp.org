volunteer to present this subject?
I believe someone did before but don't know who.

Hi Eoin,

 

During my working hours I pretend to know a little about electronic payment
systems :-) so I'd be happy enough to present on these specific subjects or
on payments security in general if there's interest.

 

Other topics I could cover:

*	Point Of Sale terminal and Pin Encryption Device physical and
logical security 
*	Magnetic Stripe cards versus Smartcards security
*	Payments certifications: PCI, EMV, Common Criteria (specifically
APACS PED protection profile), VisaPED, ZKA, etc...
*	Recent trends in electronic payments and what they mean for security
e.g. Unattended sale (think unmanned petrol stations operating 24/7)

 

I'd be happy to tailor the presentation to what's of interest to others.

Chris

Hi Stephen,
It seems to be a good "Hands on" certification as opposed to the CISSP.
There is also some progressive certifications.
See http://www.mile2.com/IT_Security_Training.html (Can get this training 
in Dublin, by the way).

You may want to look at the stuff SANS has to offer:

I got the book a while back but have only read it in parts.

Its main benefit I see is that it gives a good practical overview of hacking
- the various technologies, tools and techniques. 

CISSP gives a big picture overview of security and is not at all hands-on. 

CEH gives a big picture overview of hacking but it does so in a hands-on
learn by doing way.

It covers the industry standard tools of the trade but also some of the
lesser known ones.

It is very well laid out and presented in a very readable format.

So with or without the certification/exam the book is useful in itself to
get the big picture overview. The Table of contents is available on ECC
site.

 

As for the certification itself, I personally think the main benefit of
certs is to get a job interview i.e. to meet the prerequisite job
requirements. 

Given that, I've never seen the CEH cert as a prerequisite for a job.

 

Chris

Do you think that a more stringent approach in the schema would also help 
in mitigating against this kind of attack?
i.e. a RegEX using  [A-Z a-z 1-9]{<length>} - If it fits into the business 
requirements.
So even if the "product" (PHPXMLRPC) vulnerability was not uncovered that 
extra layer ( good schema) would defend against unknown exploits.

Do you think that a more stringent approach in the schema would also
help in mitigating against this kind of attack? 
i.e. a RegEX using  [A-Z a-z 1-9]{<length>} - If it fits into the
business requirements. 
So even if the "product" (PHPXMLRPC) vulnerability was not uncovered
that extra layer ( good schema) would defend against unknown exploits.

MessageTony,

That's an interesting point about "decoupling the security from the application" and putting the validation in the firewall layer. I agree with you that it is easier. However I feel that the more validation that goes into the firewall layer then the more that the firewall needs to "know" about the application. This is especially true of business logic validation where you have a relationship across various input fields. That will probably remain in the application itself.

Alexis,
   Good point, but I'd never suggest that you rely on the xml firewall
alone, your code still needs to be vigilant wrt its business logic.
I doubt that XML firewalls will ever fully develop the ability to
inspect data with the fullest business logic required and still remain a
pure firewall (even with BPEL). Now theres a Turing discussion I don't
want to get into! 
 
My point is that xml security should be multi-tiered so that any
weaknesses in the application can be snagged at the firewall (e.g. data
validation) and vice versa; weaknesses in the firewall can be addressed
at the application (i.e.lack of business logic). 
 
XML is a little different than other formats when it comes to data
validation. XML must conform to a specific syntax itself and there are
standard tools for examining its infoset(ASN1 anyone?). For example the
description of a Web Service using WSDL and tight XMLSchema constrains
the content appropriate for that service. It is a straightforward and
important check to make before allowing it to reach the application
itself . As Eoin said adding a regular expression to the schema is a
pretty standard and easy patch. As XML processing becomes more the norm
be prepared for more alerts like PHP XML Remote Code Execution.
 
Regards,
Tony

Anyone have any more preferences for the wishlist before a decision is 
made? I have received a few responses (30%).

FYI:


A tool for hacking web services:

WSDigger and is written to run on C# for .NET 1.1 (Win32).

http://www.foundstone.com/resources/s3i_tools.htm

The user specifies a UDDI and a search criteria such as "weather", the 
tool
determines and displays the possible available services. The user then
selects a service to connect to and the tool gets the WSDL and displays 
the
methods such as getHumidty(); or getTemp(); The user can then apply a
payload such as SQL Injection or XPATH injection and determine if the web
service has common vulnerabilities. The tool is written to accept plugins
(we ship with 3 sample plugins for XSS, SQL Injection and XPATH 
injection).
There will be a Sourceforge CVS tree to submit plugins for the framework. 
It
should be very easy to write any number of fuzzing type plugins. The code 
is
in the download and will in the CVS at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/foundstone/ this week.

You can see screen shots from a blog posting last Friday here

Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] New book - The 19 Deadly Sins of Software Security (Michael Howard, David
 LeBlanc, John Viega)
Message-ID: <OF6631A383.DA620290-ON8025703E.004B56ED@LocalDomain>

The 19 Deadly Sins of Software Security

The book is broken up into 19 chapters, or Sins, and each is only 10-15pp
long. The Sins are:

Buffer Overflows
Format String problems
SQL injection
Command injection
Failure to handle errors
Cross-site scripting
Failing to protect network traffic
Use of "magic" URLs and hidden forms
Improper use of SSL
 Use of weak password-based systems
 Failing to store and protect data
 Information leakage
 Improper file access
 Integer range errors
 Trusting network address information
 Signal race conditions
 Unauthenticated key exchange
 Failing to use cryptographically strong random numbers
 Poor usability
Each chapter is carved into the following sections:

Overview
A brief introduction to the problem, not too deep, limited to 6-12
paragraphs.

The Sin Explained
The core essence of the defect, what is the principle mistake that makes
this A Bad Thing?

Sample Code Defect
Sample code. Use at least two languages if possible, and show variations if
possible too.

Spotting the Defect Pattern
Outside of the defect itself, what designs must a developer follow to lead
up to the vulnerability?

Spotting the Defect during Code Review
What to look for in code to spot the flaw. Remember, developers are time
constrained, and in many instances knowledge constrained too, so anything
you can do to make this step easier is good!

Testing the Defect during Test
Tools and techniques you can use to test for this kind of defect.

Example Defects
Examples from CVE or SecurityFocus of this kind of defect, with some
commentary from us.

Redemption Steps
How to fix the problem in code. Once again, show many languages, and if
possible, variants.

Extra Defensive Measures
Other defenses you can put in place that do not fix the problem, but may
make it harder for a bad guy to exploit a potential defect.

Other Resources
Book chapters, web links etc.

Summary
A list of DO's, DO NOT's and CONSIDER's

A critical design goal, from the outset, was to be short and to the point;
no war stories, no gossip, just the facts.

--Credit Card Security Standard Takes Effect

The Payment Card Industry standard, which requires that merchants who
conduct credit card transactions comply with certain criteria for
handling the data, went into effect in early July.  The standard, which
is backed by Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International Inc., has
raised concerns that many of those who will be required to abide by it
do not possess the resources to implement the necessary changes and that
some are unclear about what they need to do to comply with the
standards.

Good catch!
Crowbar and Wikto apps mentioned are pretty good tools, Just tried them 
myself.
Myself and some colleagues did a "bake-off" between some well known 
commercial application scanners (Appscan & ScanDO) about a year ago. These 
tools are pretty expensive and to be honest the FP (False positive) rate 
is extremely high (60% - 70%).

If there is a wish a presentation could be given on the findings??

Another flavour of tool is the source code analysis side of things which 
in our opinion are equally weak. They cant take into account issues like 
runtime binding to configuration files which may include security 
functionality. In general tools do not understand context which is of 
paramount importance in the assessment of risk.

"about 90 percent of security hiring managers rate security certifications 
important in hiring decisions, according to IDC, which forecasts that 
spending on infosec training will reach $1 billion in the U.S. by 2006, 
with more than 70 infosec certifications currently being offered. What's

passwordsafe is very handy. I've seen it used in quite a few places.

Anything from yer man Bruce Schneier is probably worth a look. He was  described in the Economist as an 'alpha-geek'. Now there's an honour.

Hi Eoin,

 

So really what they're saying is that the problem is on the server side.

 

<mini-rant>

The server side should be designed to assume untrusted / malicious clients -
if knowledge of the client side compromises security then that's' a bad
design.

</mini-rant>

 

That said, the practice of offloading security mechanisms to the client side
is far too common and it's sometimes surprising (or not) where this arises.

 

Chris

Hey Chris,
the problem is that clients are downloading "full featured" code to their 
mobiles, as opposed to a form (in HTML), sort of like a thick client, but 
maybe not so thick.
The server side is not performing proper security but a better 
architecture is to make the client thinner and perform all DV on the 
server.
Simply put, thick client written in Java can be decompiled, altered or 
studied. 

This altered code can be uploaded to other clients who think they are 
using the real thing, like a phishing attack.??

The decompiled code can be reviewed to find weakness. Lets say there is 
code on the server doing security, but its simply a clone of the client 
side code, that would be no good is a weakness was found in the client.

The server may not be doing any App Sec, hoping client will take care of 
that (a big no no). (What you are saying?)

and loads more stuff, people more clever than myself can come up with.

Hey Chris, 
the problem is that clients are downloading "full featured" code to their
mobiles, as opposed to a form (in HTML), sort of like a thick client, but
maybe not so thick. 
The server side is not performing proper security but a better architecture
is to make the client thinner and perform all DV on the server. 
Simply put, thick client written in Java can be decompiled, altered or
studied. 
[Chris Madden] I would say that anything on the client side can be easily
reverse-engineered except for maybe" tamper resistant" / "secure hardware"
e.g. certain tokens, smartcards, etc... and that the design should assume
this. 

 Yes, java is relatively easy to reverse but then so too is assembler for
x86 or ARM7/9 in the case of mobile phones. So whether the client side is
thin or thick, java or something else the server should be doing the DV.


This altered code can be uploaded to other clients who think they are using
the real thing, like a phishing attack.?? 

[Chris Madden] But this is an issue that stands regardless of the
implementation. If the device supports download of content then obviously
the content should be authenticated. If the implementation chosen was based
on a HTML form instead of a java app/applet then this may not address the
phishing issue. e.g. if the device / user accepts non-authenticated content
anyway (mobile phone with J2ME) then some malicious app could be loaded that
emulates the form based mechanism such that the user is phished.


The decompiled code can be reviewed to find weakness. Lets say there is code
on the server doing security, but its simply a clone of the client side
code, that would be no good is a weakness was found in the client. 

[Chris Madden] Agreed and that's why full knowledge of the client side
should be assumed by the design.


The server may not be doing any App Sec, hoping client will take care of
that (a big no no). (What you are saying?) [Chris Madden] Agreed - server
should not trust client.

and loads more stuff, people more clever than myself can come up with.

Hi Eoin, 
  
So really what they're saying is that the problem is on the server side. 
  
<mini-rant> 
The server side should be designed to assume untrusted / malicious clients -
if knowledge of the client side compromises security then that's' a bad
design. 
</mini-rant> 
  
That said, the practice of offloading security mechanisms to the client side
is far too common and it's sometimes surprising (or not) where this arises.

e.g. certain tokens, smartcards, etc? and that the design should assume 
this. 
 Yes, java is relatively easy to reverse but then so too is assembler for 
x86 or ARM7/9 in the case of mobile phones. So whether the client side is 
thin or thick, java or something else the server should be doing the DV.

[Eoin]
Exactly.  The case at hand is in fact a Java, and Java is the defacto 
standard for mobile phone apps. 
The point is the parallel and convergence between web (applets) and mobile 
technology. Server side DV is a "golden rule" in App Sec. Implementation 
of thick client apps generally forget or dismiss server side  security. 
BTW its much more than DV here. Its Auth, Authz, Cache, Sess mgt.....blah 
blah blah.


This altered code can be uploaded to other clients who think they are 
using the real thing, like a phishing attack.?? 
[Chris Madden] But this is an issue that stands regardless of the 
implementation. If the device supports download of content then obviously 
the content should be authenticated. If the implementation chosen was

non-authenticated content anyway (mobile phone with J2ME) then some 
malicious app could be loaded that emulates the form based mechanism such 
that the user is phished.

[Eoin]
Point I'm making here is App Sec should be done on server, not client. 
Illegal alteration of client should not be able to compromise the server. 
People share apps for free on P2P networks, bluetooth etc. There are times 
where authentication/authorization is not the issue here regarding sharing 
software.
A phishing attack does not touch the "real" servers backend security, it 
forwards the details to the "evil-doer". The user thinks they are 
authenticating to the "real" server. hence stealing userId & password.




The decompiled code can be reviewed to find weakness. Lets say there is 
code on the server doing security, but its simply a clone of the client 
side code, that would be no good is a weakness was found in the client. 
[Chris Madden] Agreed and that?s why full knowledge of the client side

I'd suggest that a major risk from a fat client is a badly-implemented
official version of the client, as opposed to some hacked one, as the
article discusses. There's nothing inherently wrong with using a fat
client, as long as all communication goes via some secure channel. But,
a development error could break that principle. 

With a thin client (ideally pure, basic html) you have the browser's
pretty well accepted security available. This generic security
implementation is most likely better than any custom implementation.
Granted some custom code might also be needed, but the less of it (and
the more isolated) the better!

Sure thing.... 

There is potential for developer mistake in a fat client, things like:

Storage of private/secret jey in code (hardcoded)
Storage of password (hardcoded)
Absolute paths for server or client.
Developemnt accounts or trapdoors (Debug) which are commented out, but may 
be still valid!

Stuff like that.....when decompiled would be handy.
