Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] Meeting - 20th of march
Message-ID: <OF31B7378B.387D62D7-ON80257129.00419AB7-80257129.0042491F@RITSPROD>

Hello good people and fellow security consultants,
a couple of things,

Firstly the meeting, a reminder.
We have Fortify software presenting at our next meeting. Well worth the 
effort to attend for security heads and also any developers you know.
The approach Fortify take in the assistance of developing secure code is 
going to be crucial going forward in the IT industry. Security is more and 
more being recognised as being a measure of Software quality.

Drop me a line (if you have not  already) if you wish to come.

Secondly:
The OWASP testing project is kicking off again after a short sabbatical. 
This project aims to deliver an application penetration testing guide and 
also a pen test checklist. If anyone wishes to be involved please don't 
hesitate to drop me a line. Knowledge of application penetration testing 
is essential.

best regards,

Eoin
OWASP Ireland Chapter Lead

Interesting article (with equally sensationalist title) and paper on RFID
tags.

"Cellphone could crack RFID tags, says cryptographer"
http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=180201688

Shamir (who put the S in RSA) used power analysis attacks to determine RFID
passwords. Power analysis attacks became more mainstream in 1998 when used
to attack smartcards. There's a seminal paper on this by Paul Kocher.
Fault attacks would probably be successful against RFID tags also.

The easiest way to increase RFID tag security would be to borrow technology
from smartcard security. However, given that RFID tags are generally very
low cost items, it may not make financial sense to increase their security. 
So, RFID tags should be recognized as low/no security items and treated as
such.

Now that would be interesting. But is the RFID systems ran on TDM (Time 
division Multiplexing) you may need a very big bag?

What about DOS attack on RFID enabled systems either by carrying a bagfull
of rfid tags (through a shop!) or have a device that emits a huge stream 
of
RFID radio data?

Interesting article (with equally sensationalist title) and paper on RFID
tags.

"Cellphone could crack RFID tags, says cryptographer"
http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=180201688

Shamir (who put the S in RSA) used power analysis attacks to determine 
RFID
passwords. Power analysis attacks became more mainstream in 1998 when used
to attack smartcards. There's a seminal paper on this by Paul Kocher.
Fault attacks would probably be successful against RFID tags also.

The easiest way to increase RFID tag security would be to borrow 
technology
from smartcard security. However, given that RFID tags are generally very
low cost items, it may not make financial sense to increase their 
security. 
So, RFID tags should be recognized as low/no security items and treated as
such.

Hi,
Thanks to everyone who made the meeting last night.
I hope everyone got something out if it. 
Comments would be appreciated, if people thought it was too technical or 
not enough.
If there an interest in the slides, If so I shall post them on the chapter

From: jeff.williams at owasp.org (Jeff Williams)
Date: Sun, 26 Mar 2006 09:24:20 -0500
Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] [Owasp-world] Reminder: 2006 European OWASP AppSec Conference - May 30-31, 2006 near Brussels
Message-ID: <02db01c650e0$f9251050$1204a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is holding its annual European AppSec (Application Security)
Conference May 30-31, 2006 at the Catholic University of Leuven (aka
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or K.U. Leuven) in Leuven, which is 25 km
from Brussels.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES: Early registration for the conference ends April 30.
The reduced rates for the conference hotels ends mid to late April depending
on the hotel.

AGENDA: This conference has dual tracks like last years' US conference. The
speakers and agenda are available on the OWASP website at:

             http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html.

This year's speakers include popular speakers from previous conferences like
Dinis Cruz and Ivan Ristic, but also includes many new speakers to the OWASP
Conference, including Andrew Van Der Stock (project lead for the OWASP
Guide), Roger Thornton (CTO of Fortify), Mike Andrews of Foundstone, and
myself (Dave Wichers - COO of Aspect Security).

NEW: We also have introduced for the first time two panels, which should
generate some lively debate. The first panel is on "Should companies be
emulating Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)?" and the 2nd is
on: "Are we winning the war?" - Are we actually getting a handle on
application security issues and making things better, or are things still
getting worse?

REGISTRATION DETAILS: Registration is open and the conference fee is 300
Euros for early registration and 350 Euros for registrations after April 30,
2006.

TUTORIALS - May 29, 2006:

OWASP has arranged to have two one-day tutorials the day prior to the
conference. These one day tutorials will be held at the university and are
only 600 Euros for conference attendees.

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE: This powerful hands on course
focuses on the most common web application security problems, including the
OWASP Top Ten. The course introduces and demonstrates hacking techniques,
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students
really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code. 

WEB SERVICES and XML SECURITY: The movement towards Web Services and Service
Oriented architecture (SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to
deal with new risks posed by these architectures. This session takes a
pragmatic approach towards identifying Web Services security risks and
selecting and applying countermeasures to the application, code, web
servers, databases, application, and identity servers and related software.

More details on these training courses are available at:

        http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/training.html 

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - May 30, 2006: The traditional evening dinner/social
event is being held at the nearby Faculty Club. The Faculty club is a
restaurant annex conference centre located in a medieval part of Leuven. We
can walk there from the conference, and will have a social hour followed by
a 3-course dinner. Dinner is typically followed by drinks nearby. The dinner
event is 40 Euros.

HOTELS - We have arranged for conference rates at nearby hotels. Many of
these rates expire mid to late April, so please book early. More information
is available at:

 
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/accommodations.html 

If you know others that would be interested in attending this OWASP
conference, please forward them this email and let them know about this
opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Thanks, Dave
