Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Healthcare Security Event This Wednesday
Message-ID: <f0339088-542b-12f8-9444-453c90f883f2@owasp.org>

Hi all,

A quick reminder that the OWASP Dublin February event is this Wednesday 
in Hilton Dublin, Charlemont Place. We've got two great topics in the 
area of healthcare security.

  * Cyber Incident Detection for EMR Systems
    Davey McGlade, Principal Architect & Cybersecurity Lead, Kainos Software
  * Cybersecurity Risk Management Expectations for Medical Device
    Manufacturers
    Anita Finnegan, CEO, Nova Leah

The session is booked up so hopefully you got your ticket already, but 
if you can't make it please remember to cancel so we can give someone 
else the chance to attend.

We look forward to seeing you then.

Thanks,

Brendan and the rest of the OWASP Dublin team

Hi all,

Due to the impending bad weather on Wednesday 28th we are cancelling the 
OWASP/ISACA Healthcare CyberSecurity event. There's a status Orange 
weather warning from Met Eireann with 4-6cm snow predicted, so we don't 
want to put anyone at risk or have people stranded. We hope you 
understand this decision and we will endeavour to reschedule as soon as 
possible.

Thanks for your support,

OWASP Dublin team
