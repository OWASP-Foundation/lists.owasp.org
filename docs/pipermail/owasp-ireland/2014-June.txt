Subject: [Owasp-ireland] OWASP Security Shepherd v2.0
Message-ID: <CAEaSsmNN=1pRVLjrwosz-SsWLTRNkBfaYcRrnDD7hYOTXef+vw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone,

I'm happy to be announcing the new version of the OWASP Security Shepherd
<http://bit.ly/owaspSecurityShepherd> project has been released!

For those unfamiliar with Security Shepherd, it enables users to learn or
to improve upon existing manual penetration testing skills. The new version
is loaded with nearly 50 levels implemented with the aim of fostering and
improving web and mobile application security awareness among a varied
skill-set demographic.

Many of these levels include insufficient mitigations and protections to
these risks, such as blacklist filters, atrocious encoding schemes,
barbaric security mechanisms and poor security configuration. The modules
have been crafted to provide not only a challenge for a security novice,
but security professionals as well.

So check out the wiki <http://bit.ly/owaspSecurityShepherd> and try out the
new suite of challenges. If anybody is going to AppSec EU stop by the Security
Shepherd talk <http://bit.ly/shepherdAtAppSecEu> where we'll be going
through the new version in detail! If anybody is interested in contributing
to the project, mail me off list!

Happy Monday!

Mark Denihan

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Call for speakers
Message-ID: <CACH=f5ZiPBcFJtJ_DPKtxOoeSQ0g2XZrfYWNEGTs=R9sKsaL8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

As you may be aware our Dublin chapter meetings are driven by the
contributions of those within our community. To this end I would like any
of you (or if you know anyone) who may be interested in speaking at one of
our chapter meetings to get in contact with me or any of the other board
members (Eoin, Fabio and Mark).

We are interested in speakers from all aspects of security, for example, we
have recently had speakers on the following topics;


   1.     PCI DSS
   2.     Social Engineering - The Art of Human Hacking
   3.     Top 10 defensive Java developer controls
   4.     Top 10 Web Hacks of 2013
   5.     Building a shield of security - Vulnerability Management by the
   numbers and dumb robots!


Next month we hope to run a day workshop (Saturday) on Mobile Security with
3 speakers and then a Capture the Flag run using our very own OWASP project
Security Shepherd  ( Mark Denihan and Sean Duggan). For this event we
require 1 further speaker.

If you would like to speak and may not be available in the coming months we
would still like to hear from you as you may be free for one of our other
events.

Our chapter events are generally held on Thursday evenings from 6:30 to
9:00pm  at our new location Morgan McKinley's offices, 1 Burlington road
with two one hour speaker slots. Morgan McKinley kindly provide BEER and
PIZZA for attendees.

It's also possible to become a chapter sponsor. This means that you get
your organisation mentioned in meeting promotion, recognition at the
beginning of the meeting and promotional material at the meeting.

We currently have the following sponsorship options available:


   1.     ?250 for an individual meeting sponsorship
   2.     ?1500 for annual chapter sponsorship


For more information please contact one of the board members.
