<PRE>The Dublin chapter is dedicated to openness and transparency.  On 30th
March 2016 we announced an election to replace two board members and open
the board to non-officer positions for volunteers.  During this process the
goals for the Dublin Chapter grew in ambition and inclusiveness.
Subsequently our new board agreed to expand the officer positions and hold
an election for all positions with the aim to further improve participation
and so achieve even greater events.



In our zeal we made the new announcements on the same email chain sent out
to only the members of the newly enlarged board.  Due to our commitment to
transparency, we are keen for you, as a member of OWASP, to have your say
and therefore are re-holding the election with the same candidates to
ensure that all of our members have an opportunity to vote.



We invite you to renew your OWASP Dublin subscription (
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A>) and, as paid members affiliated
with OWASP Dublin, ensure that you have your say in the direction of the
chapter. We invite all paying members to participate in this election. The
election will commence on 20th October and end on 27th October.



As always, whether you are a paying member or not, please feel free to
express your thoughts and opinions on the Dublin chapter in public (on our
distribution list, Facebook, Twitter, etc) or directly with any board
member. We are very keen to ensure the chapter is open, transparent and
that we work to benefit the community and any thoughts or opinions that can
help us improve these objectives will be welcomed. Also, if you want to
play a more active role in the Dublin chapter please let one of us know.
