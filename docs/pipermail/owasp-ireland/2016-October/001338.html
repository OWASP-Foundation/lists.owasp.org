<PRE>Hi All,

OWASP is soliciting training providers for the AppSecEU conference which
will be held in Belfast 8th - 12th May 2017. <A HREF="https://2017.appsec.eu">https://2017.appsec.eu</A>

Topics

We are interested in all topics related to Web Application Security and
OWASP, in particular, but not limited to (these are just examples):

   - Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding,
   methods, processes, SDLC
   - Vulnerability analysis: code review, pentest, static analysis
   - Threat modelling
   - Mobile security
   - Cloud security
   - Browser security
   - HTML5 security
   - OWASP tools or projects in practice
   - New technologies, paradigms, tools
   - Privacy in web apps, Web services (REST, XML) and data storage
   - Operations and software security
   - Management topics in Application Security: Business Risks,
   Outsourcing/Offshoring, Awareness Programs, Project Management, Managing
   SDLC

Training should be of a practical nature, i.e. we will look favorably on a
hands-on training. Also, please refrain from submitting marketing talks or
including sales pitches within the training.
Terms

All trainers will be required to submit a Training Instructor Agreement
&lt;<A HREF="https://2017.appsec.eu/assets/docs/Training_Instructor_Agreement.pdf">https://2017.appsec.eu/assets/docs/Training_Instructor_Agreement.pdf</A>&gt;.

The following conditions apply for those that want to provide training at
the OWASP AppSecEU conference. The training provider:

   - should provide class syllabus / training materials.
   - will cover travel and accommodations for the instructor(s) and all
   course materials for students.
   - can brand training materials to increase their exposure.
   - should promote training on all available media eg. Twitter, Linkedin

OWASP will provide the venue, marketing, registration logistics and basic
wireless internet access. If you need additional technical arrangements, it
is important to let us know.

OWASP will reserve up to two training slots at no cost and the trainer may
reserve up to one slot at no cost. Please note that for data privacy
reasons OWASP can&#8217;t provide trainers with contact information of the
attendees.
