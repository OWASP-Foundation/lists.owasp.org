<PRE>Software
Presenter:  Barmak Meftah

Abstract: This presentation focuses on turning abstract software security=20
theories into practical steps that you can use to develop and deploy=20
measurably more secure software. The key to solving the software security=20
problem is getting started. Away from broad process re-engineering and=20
silver-bullet technologies, the session focuses on practical actions that=20
every organization can take today. The steps are based on real-world=20
examples and cover the development process from upfront risk assessment to =

post-deployment. Artifacts of the steps, including checklists and software =

security metrics will be reviewed and discussed.

Title: Application Defense ? Software That  Fights Back=20
Presenter: Barmak Meftah

Abstract:  In the last decade, the majority of security breaches occurred=20
when networks were broken into directly. Today, however, most security=20
threats and exploits derive from hackers maliciously manipulating software =

applications, without ever breaching perimeter network defenses.  The=20
reality is that software applications have changed little to address these =

new software-based attack strategies.  This presentation explores a new=20
and rich field: software application forensics and countermeasures. By=20
using real-world examples, this session will define and demonstrate=20
technical topics like attack surface, pattern recognition, tracers and=20
method guards. The audience will leave with an understanding of=20
cutting-edge techniques for strengthening software code and preparing for=20
business discussions about liability and post-intrusion investigation.=20
This session will also investigate common preventative and forensic tools=20
such as intrusion detection systems and application firewalls.


This meeting shall be well worth attending, especially for those involved=20
in development, so tell your colleagues.
Drop me a line or call my cell if you require any further information

Anyone wishing to attend please drop me a line as we need a list of=20
attendees for security purposes :)

best regards,
hoping to see you there,

Eoin Keary.
OWASP Chapter founder &amp; Lead.
