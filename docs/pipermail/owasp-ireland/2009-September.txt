Kudos to Eoin and everyone who volunteered their time and effort to make a 
great OWASP Ireland event!

With more than 100+ attendees and a fantastic line-up of speakers I think 
this will be the first of many to come...

Great to hear you all enjoyed it.
It was a great success (even the lunch in "Hogworts"). The social event was
fun also.
We (OWASP Board and  I) are talking about 2010 already! If anyone has any
suggestions on improvement please feel free to mail the list.
My main issue was time slippage.

I have to agree, great conference - well done Eoin and everyone else 
involved in organising it.

I would agree on the time slippage, the best system I've seen (and I 
think you started doing it later in the day, happened on my talk anyway) 
was that at defcon. The goon's signal when you have 15, 10 and 5 minutes 
left and then finally when you have none left. Q+A is then in a 
different room so the turnaround time between talks is reduced. I had 
several people contact me today saying they wanted to ask questions but 
we had to stop people asking any more after about 4 of them because of 
the time issue.

Other than that I couldn't fault it :)

I would have to agree with Yann I thoroughly enjoyed the day and the dancing
afterwards! So thanks to Eoin and eveyone else who organised the day. I
think perhaps allowing 5-10 minutes between talks might help with the time
issue, or perhaps it could be a two day event? I certainly picked up a few
new things from the talks, is there an eval version of taint by the way?
Regards,
Conor.

Hello,
As with many things in life we  sometimes half-understand issues.
This may sound basic to some of you? would there be appetite to cover off
XSS & SQL Injection *prevention*. i.e. How to defend against such attack
vectors? imho this would be very useful to developers and testers alike, we
can cover off the basics and look at what u need to do to be "SQLI/XSS
proof".

We could also include (over forthcoming meetings) Error handling,
authorisation, data validation and so forth such that all chapter members
have a solid grounding in the root causes of weakness. Once this is done we
can look at attacks in the wild, more sophisticated attacks (real world) and
even include a small bit of hybrid security (App & N/W).

If this is a runner I'll set something up over the next couple of weeks.

Eoin

Interesting topic on DoS via RegEx. Based on the exponential nature of the
regex engine while it consumes the input.
Such that even:

Regex: ^\d*[0-9](|.\d*[0-9]|)*$  (Decimal validation) can crash upon a
