Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Threat Modelling Tool Recommendations
Message-ID: <BLU138-W107117123D6171B57E394BBD960@phx.gbl>


Hello,

I'm working on a threat modelling project and currently identifying possible tools that could help.  I'm looking at the Microsoft Threat Analysis and Modeling tool but would like to evaluate other possible alternatives.

I've taken a look at the 'Alternative open-source Risk Management tools' on the OWASP site (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling) but a lot of the products are either pre-alpha or discontinued.

Does anybody have any recommendations for tools that I should take a look at - commercial or open source?

Many thanks,

Leo

Hi,
Seen as I am intending to reboot the code review guide (CRG) after the OWASP
Ireland 2010 event, I am looking for volunteers and would love some
local chapter members to contribute??

I was thinking that I would like to do a session on the code review guide in
the next two weeks or so covering off the guide, bad code, anti patterns,
application & implementation.

This may give some people insight into the project, learn a little more
about mistakes in application development and also develop a hunger to
contribute some of their expertise to OWASP and the CRG.

If there is enough interest ill book the meeting room in EY (Dublin) etc

How does the 25th August sound???

any takers?



Eoin

Leo

The "European Network and Information Security Agency"* maintains an 
"Inventory of Risk Management / Risk Assessment Methods and Tools" **
at http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/cr/risk-management-inventory
They also have a comparison table.

Since it's free, I reckon that the MS tool is fairly popular.

Hope that helps

Alexis

*Hands up anybody who knew such an agency existed.
**Should "Risk Management" be called (un)educated guess management

Congratulations to Leo McCavana on answering the challenge questions 
correctly... you are coming to OWASP Ireland 2010 for FREE!!!

The XSS vulnerable function below allows anyone to send un-validated user 
input (which could contain arbitrary code) and being output back to the 
browser. To mitigate against this, you need to implement proper input 
validation and output encoding. More info about XSS and how to prevent it 
could be found here: 

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet

Thanks to all those who submitted an answer and until the next challenge 
on Friday 20th!

Congratulations to *Kieran Tully *on answering the challenge question
correctly... you are coming to OWASP Ireland 2010 for FREE!!!

The main issue is that the code is vulnerable to buffer overflow.

#define MAXLEN 1024
 char *buf[MAXLEN];
..................

read(configFile,inputbuffer,MAXLEN);
.....................

strcpy(buf,inputbuf);
.......................

read() is not guaranteed to null-terminate the input buffer.
strncpy() could be used to prevent buffer overflow.

The above code will behave correctly if the data read from configFile is
null terminated on disk as expected. (Null termination defines boundsof a
string). If it is possible to modify this input so that it does not contain
the expected null character, This shall result in the strcpy() to continue
copying from memory until it encounters an arbitrary null character.

This may potentially cause an overflow the destination buffer which can
result in malicious code execution if the attacker can control the contents
of memory immediately following inputbuffer.
Thanks to all those who submitted an answer and until the next challenge on
Friday 27th!

Just wanted to pick up on the topic of arrays and pointers ala "char *buf[MAXLEN];" as this is one area that is commonly misunderstood.

Assuming this is C code...it is worth pointing out that due to C's operator precedence "char *buf[MAXLEN];" defines an array of pointers to type char - not a pointer to an array of chars as one may expect.
"char buf[MAXLEN];" defines an array of chars as expected.


The obvious difference is that sizeof(buf) will be 4096 i.e. 4 times MAXLEN, not 1024 as expected (assuming pointers are 4 bytes as determined by build environment)
There are other subtle differences that can catch the unwary related to this point e.g. how buf is interpreted if passed to a C function.
This subtlety can and does lead to nasty bugs.

This topic is covered extensively in Peter Van Der Linden's excellent book "Expert C Programming - Deep C Secrets"  The chapter is entitled "The Shocking Truth: C Arrays and Pointers Are NOT the Same!"

ResultSet rs = stmt.execute(query);

You have to answer the following two questions:

1) What is the fundamental issue with this construct?
2) What is the potential vulnerability?

All answers should be sent to ireland at owasp.org. 

Thanks and best of luck!

3. Visa offers new guidance on securing payment applications

Visa on Tuesday announced a set of security best practices for vendors of 
payment applications and for the systems integrators and resellers 
responsible for implementing and managing them.

4. Microsoft SDL and the Creative Commons

I am happy to announce that from this point forward, Microsoft will be 
making their publicly available SDL documentation and other SDL process 
content available to the development community under a Creative Commons 
license. 

By changing the license terms, they are now allowing people and 
organizations to copy, distribute and transmit the documentation to 
others; this means that you can now incorporate content from the SDL 
documents we release under Creative Commons into your internal process 
documentation ? subject to the terms specified by the Creative Commons 
license mentioned above. 

You can learn more about the specifics of that license here: 
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ 

Note that they do not intend to change the licensing for any of the SDL 
tools released by Microsoft ? those will continue to use existing 
Microsoft licenses.

Their first two documents for release under a Creative Commons license 
will be the English versions of the ?Simplified Implementation of the 
Microsoft SDL? whitepaper and the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle 
(SDL) - Version 5.0 paper that illustrates how Microsoft applies the SDL 
to our own products and services.  Those releases will be completed over 
the next few weeks. 

Check out Microsoft?s blog page here: 
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sdl/archive/2010/08/26/microsoft-sdl-and-the-creative-commons.aspx

5. HTML5 Raises New Security Issues

When it comes to new security issues, the security team for the Firefox 
browser have the new version of the Web HyperText Markup Language, HTML5, 
foremost on the mind. 

"Web apps are becoming incredibly rich with HTML5. The browser is starting 
to manage full-bore applications and not just Web pages," said Sid Stamm, 
who works on Firefox security issues for the Mozilla Foundation. Stamm was 
speaking at the Usenix Security Symposium, held last week in Washington 
D.C. 

You could find the full article here:

6. SAMM and the Financial Services Industry

The financial services industry is the perfect work stream for frameworks 
like SAMM. Financial services are widely known as the an area which 
invests heavily in areas such as information security, it?s heavily 
regulated (some say not heavily enough) and  a daily challenge to FS is to 
maintain leading edge security but manage costs and usability whilst also 
being compliant with industry regulations,  corporate governance and 
local/regional/global  legislation.

SAMM covers four domains which in turn have sub domains. These four 
?pillars? attempt to examine all aspects of software development, all 
external catalysts which may result in either making security more robust 
or result in weakness.

The beauty of SAMM is its simplicity.

Thanks Fabio, interesting! Goes beyond current PCI-DSS / PA-DSS in
some respects.

Is there somewhere I can sign up to get updates like this from Visa?

The Morgan is a bit more than I would like to spend. The Trinity
College accommodation seemed perfect but they cease to lease rooms on
the 17th. Everything else I have looked at is either too expensive or
has bad reviews.

Any recommendations?

Thank you,

*
*1. What is the fundamental issue with this construct?*
Answer: The code dynamically constructs and executes a SQL query. Better off
using a parameterised SQL.

5. HTML5 Raises New Security Issues

When it comes to new security issues, the security team for the Firefox 
browser have the new version of the Web HyperText Markup Language, HTML5, 
foremost on the mind. 

"Web apps are becoming incredibly rich with HTML5. The browser is starting 
to manage full-bore applications and not just Web pages," said Sid Stamm, 
who works on Firefox security issues for the Mozilla Foundation. Stamm was 
speaking at the Usenix Security Symposium, held last week in Washington 
D.C.

6. SAMM and the Financial Services Industry

The financial services industry is the perfect work stream for frameworks 
like SAMM. Financial services are widely known as the an area which 
invests heavily in areas such as information security, it?s heavily 
regulated (some say not heavily enough) and  a daily challenge to FS is to 
maintain leading edge security but manage costs and usability whilst also 
being compliant with industry regulations,  corporate governance and 
local/regional/global  legislation.

SAMM covers four domains which in turn have sub domains. These four 
?pillars? attempt to examine all aspects of software development, all 
external catalysts which may result in either making security more robust 
or result in weakness.

The beauty of SAMM is its simplicity.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Extending Burp Suite in Python
Message-ID: <AANLkTimoAYfm7K=4usHqr+_QGk-FFjfoCMhH2Z++_MBo@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

Just to let you know in case this is of interest for some of you, I
wrote a Jython binding for the Burp Suite application. This enables
users to create Burp Suite extensions directly in the Python language.

If you want to have a look at my extension:
http://blog.ombrepixel.com/post/2010/08/30/Extending-Burp-Suite-in-Python

Please let me know if you find it useful or if you have any queries on
the binding.

Cheers,

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Expert Needed
Message-ID: <AANLkTik0MTVvjr2f0OB69Dj3XbG8Kgp9V44YSw9xN_O_@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,
I was contacted recently by a friend in the media looking to get an opinion
on the capabilities of a piece of software that is being pimped on the
internet at the moment for a story that he is working on.  Being more of a
generalist, I wasn't able to help him, but thought that I may know where to
ask.

Basically, he is looking for "an expert" that could possible comment on
whether the touted capabilities of a PC download are in fact possible, and
(as I pointed out) if there is anything more going on than there appears to
be (spyware/malware).

I'm reluctant to name names of the guilty on a public list, so hence why I
am being so oblique.  He is not looking for a complete clean-room reverse
engineering of an application, although if that is possible then super.

If anyone on the list working in the anti-virus, anti-spyware/malware
industry that would be prepared to at least talk with us, please contact me
directly.

If the list feels that there is a more appropriate place to raise this
query, then please let me know and accept my apologies.

Cheers
Pete
