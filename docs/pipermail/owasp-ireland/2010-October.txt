facing businesses in Ireland and what you can do to help deal with those
threats. We have already lined up a number of excellent speakers such as;

environment. Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors
http://www.iriss.ie/iriss/sponsors.htm IRISS is able to host this event free
of charge to the attendees.

In parallel to the above speaking sessions Ireland's premier Cyber Security
Challenge, HackEire, will be held to identify Ireland's top cyber security
experts. HackEire will see 10 teams, up to a maximum of four people per
team, compete against each other in a controlled environment to see which
team will be the first to exploit weaknesses in a number of systems and
declare victory. The purpose of the HackEire competition is to demonstrate
how attackers could gain access to your systems and allow you to learn from
the event on how to prevent such attacks from impacting your network.

More details of the event and the HackEire challenge are available at
http://www.iriss.ie/iriss/iriss_conference_2010.htm

----- Forwarded by Fabio E Cerullo/IR/AIB on 14/10/2010 11:30 -----


SANS is pleased to offer six informative and complimentary Webcasts
during the next six weeks. Take advantage of this opportunity to augment
your knowledge on cutting edge topics in the infosec community. Here is
the schedule and a brief description of each presentation.


- 19 October at 15:00 CEST/UTC+2
Pen-Testing a Proprietary Target presented by Stephen Sims

Penetration testers often have a toolkit and techniques they use to
perform testing against commercial targets. When faced with a new
application, service, system, or protocol, it may be difficult to
determine the best steps for a thorough assessment. This short
presentation walks through some of the considerations and techniques
used when performing a penetration test against a proprietary or custom
target.  To attend this webcast, please register at:
http://www.sans.org/info/65473

- 21 October at 13:00 CEST/UTC+2
How to Implement Practical Security with SEC401 - Solutions that Work
presented by Eric Cole

Many organizations are spending money on security and still getting
broken into because they are doing good things, but they are not doing
the right things. Security Essentials teaches people how to effective
implement security that works.  In this webcast we will look at what
organizations need to do to be properly protected.  To attend this
webcast, please register at: http://www.sans.org/info/65953

- 25 October at 15:00 CEST/UTC+2
What every Network Forensics Analyst needs to know about IPv6 presented
by Johannes Ullrich

IPv6 is coming. You may not like or need it, but it will happen and
probably already exists on your network. If you have a packet capture
with only IPv4 traffic, you probably didn't do it right and missed the
IPv6 traffic leaking into your network from modern operating systems
preconfigured to attempt IPv6 connections. This webcast will cover some
of the IPv6 features that a forensic analyst needs to know in order to
understand this traffic, as well as how to use standard tools like
wireshark or tcpdump to analyze IPv6 traffic.  To attend this webcast,
please register at: http://www.sans.org/info/65478

- 26 October at 15:00 CEST/UTC+2
Cyberwar or Business as Usual? - The State of International Cyber
Security Efforts presented by James Tarala

Are we near the point of cyber-armageddon or are we simply engaged in a
new reality of information security priorities? Are the attacks being
discovered daily against private sector and public federal systems
somehow unique and new, or are they simply the new reality of
cyberspace? Organizations are regularly forced to make difficult
decisions about how best to protect their information systems.
Executives open the newspaper daily to find another example of effective
cyber attacks and hacking. How do organizations know when security
mechanisms are enough to keep their data safe? In an effort to answer
this question and respond to mounting cyber incidents worldwide, the US
federal government has been engaging in numerous efforts to secure
cyberspace. But what are they, and will they be enough? In this
presentation James Tarala, a Senior Instructor with the SANS Institute
and a Principal Consultant at Enclave Security, will describe current
efforts and the tools being offered to help citizens and protect
cyberspace.  To attend this webcast, please register at:

- 2 November at 15:00 CET/UTC+1
Browser Exploitation for Fun and Profit presented by Raul Siles

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is still one of the most prevalent
vulnerabilities on web applications, and its exploitation is a very
relevant threat to be considered by any organization. As the owner of
the web application, you don't want your visitors and customers to get
exploited through your website. As the owner of any company, you don't
want your users, browsing the web innocently, to become victims of large
scale or targeted attacks. Browser exploitation frameworks, such as
BeEF, provide attackers and pen-testers advanced capabilities to perform
in-depth devastating attacks into an organization, using the ubiquitous
web browser as the entry point.  To register for this webcast, please
register at: http://www.sans.org/info/65488

- 16 November at 11:00 CET/UTC+1
Social Engineering with Frame Control presented by Michael Murr

This one hour webcast will discuss the role of frame control in social
engineering. Join us as we talk about concepts such as how frame control
is fundamental to social engineering, frame alignment, techniques to
change frames, and using frame control to influence and persuade others.
To attend this webcast, please register at:

We hope you will join us and will find these informative sessions
beneficial to your workplace.
