Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Friday giveaway - Ticket to BSidesLondon
Message-ID: <CAE69ks5x7OtOif9Nze=sFqFR8XiMfPRAB4icKCKKjA2NMO8M5w@mail.gmail.com>

hi there,

As you probably know, next 24th April BsidesLondon is happening in central
London. I've attended it last year and It is a really cool event to meetup
with your infosec peeps.

They kindly offered the OWASP Ireland community a ticket to be raffled
answering this simple question:

What is the venue's name where BsidesLondon will be hosted this year?

The first one who answers it correctly, gets the free ticket.

If you need help, just visit their website ;-)
