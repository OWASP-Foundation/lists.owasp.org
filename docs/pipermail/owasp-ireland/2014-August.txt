Hi all,



Just a quick email to let you know about a new OWASP chapter which has been
set up in Cork - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cork. The Dublin and
Limerick chapters have been successful so we have now added this new
chapter to facilitate the growing community around the Cork area. We would
like to invite you and your colleagues or any other interested parties to
come along whenever you can to the newest Irish chapter!


Our first official chapter meeting will take place on Tuesday 2nd Sept 2014
? with free beer and pizza ;) Please sign up to our mailing list for
further info on this meeting and for future Cork chapter information -
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Cork. The first few chapter
meetings will be held in conjunction with CorkSec (
http://corksec.robertmcardle.com/).

As is always the case for the other chapters, we will always be on the
lookout for people interested in sharing their knowledge with the community
in any of the three domains:

 - Builders

 - Breakers

 - Defenders

So come along to Cork chapter meetings if you would like to hear about, or
share information with the community on how to ethically hack your own
systems, how to defend your applications and how to build security into
your applications. The chapter meetings also provide a great opportunity to
meet like-minded people with similar interests for general discussion,
chit-chat and banter! :)



Who might be interested?


 - Application Developers

 - IT Infrastructure Engineers

 - Application Testers and Quality Assurance

 - Application Project Management and Staff

 - Security Managers and Staff

 - Executives, Managers and Staff Responsible for IT Security Governance /
Compliance

 - Students

 - Security Researchers

 - Anyone with an Interest in Application Security


Feel free to contact the chapter leads, Fiona (fiona.collins at owasp.org) and
Darren (darren.fitzpatrick at owasp.org) at any time for further information
or come along to chapter meetings as advertised on the mailing list.


And please spread the word :)



Cheers,

OWASP Cork Team
