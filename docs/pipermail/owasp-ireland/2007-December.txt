Hi,
I recently did an article/interview for Finance magazine relating the the
idea of developing applications in a secure manner.
Its still obvious to many of us that some groups in industry "don't get it".
It may be good collateral if you need to push an idea or get the idea of
secure application development across to a client or development team you
are involved in.
Let me know what you think??

I suppose the moral is not to buy "western digital" drives unless you like
corporations telling you what you can do with your data??

Also I *hope* to have another meeting easly in the new year. Anyone have any
suggestions on what they would like to see or do? This should give me some
time in organising speakers and content.

Regards,

Eoin
