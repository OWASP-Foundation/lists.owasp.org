Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Upcoming Cork Security Event - Amalgamating IT
 Security Best Practices within an Organisation
Message-ID: <CALLx+Dsw4L_7wEDafvSQNXx3dB08kdEZ5EWOtmqfC+JncDDdzA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just to let you know about an upcoming security event happening in Cork
next month. OWASP, CorkSec, ISC2 and ISACA decided to come together for a
joint event on March 24th 2015. At the moment, talk proposals are being
worked out, so we will follow up when these have been nailed down.

You can register for the event here:
https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/amalgamating-it-security-best-practices-within-an-organisation-tickets-15795683314


If you would like to speak, you are more than welcome to submit to myself
or Fiona with a title and short overview of what the talk will entail (even
if it hasn't been put together yet!). Talks should fit loosely within the
event title listed below, while having an element of OWASP style ...
application security / penetration testing / secure code / SDLC / Mobile /
Security Vulnerabilities, etc., if your submission would be from the OWASP
side of the house.


Date: Tuesday March 24th 2015

Venue: River Lee Hotel

Event Title: Amalgamating IT Security Best Practices within an Organisation

Topics Include (but not limited to):

   - The acquisition
   - The compliance challenge
   - SDLC
   - Culture and people
   - Business pressure verses security
   - Legal constraints

Times: 3:30 - 6 PM with refreshments after (4 x 30 min talks)


Hope you can make it!

Darren & Fiona

 - OWASP Cork Board
