*In Hours, Thieves Took $45 Million in A.T.M. Scheme*

?In the place of guns and masks, this cybercrime organization used laptops
and the Internet,? said Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in
Brooklyn.

Message-ID: <CAE69ks6m0RPKbLvJ6Hc26XxNwBAvhhOJgBp-v8kNBQM+gD20SA@mail.gmail.com>

Facebook is pleased to sponsor a Capture the Flag event in conjunction with
Honeynet Ireland chapter at the SOURCE Dublin conference.

Join the best security hackers and penetration testers from around the
world at this all-day event, hosted in the Facebook Dublin offices. Ten
teams of up to 4 players will compete to see who can "hack the world" in a
series of increasingly difficult levels. Hackingis only part of the game
however; in an added twist, once you hack a target you then have to defend
it against your fellow hackers!

Points are awarded during the day for the levels completed and valuable
cash prizes are on offer for the top three teams on the day. Food, drinks
and beers will be provided, so come hungry and Hack On!

The CTF is on SATURDAY MAY 25th at the Facebook Dublin office.

Check in and breakfast at 9 AM, CTF from 10 AM to 5 PM.

Participants should bring with them: a laptop, power source, and a router
or switch.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Application Security Workshop and Talks
Message-ID: <35A0FB79-2045-478B-A508-82C7C2ED5B17@owasp.org>

Good morning everyone,
 
I?m happy to announce that OWASP Dublin are hosting a joint event with Realex Payments in their Dublin office later this month.
 
There will be free application security training followed by two interesting security talks in the evening.
 
Training
Eoin Keary will be delivering free application security training between 2pm and 5pm on the 30th May. Eoin was the founder of OWASP Ireland and is currently the global vice chair for OWASP (amongst many other things!) He has delivered application security training to many developers and security professionals around the world and recently delivered a training course to over 400 people at the RSA Conference.
The training will focus on secure application development and why we can't hack ourselves secure. It will be covering why penetration testing on its own does not work approaches to improvement including "knowing what you don't know" and how to measure change.
It will be technical training covering XSS eradication, client side security and browser DOM curiosities.
 
Talks
The talks will be starting at 6pm in our office and OWASP have arranged two very interesting talks! Diarmaid McManushttps://twitter.com/elephant_rb from Realex Payments will be expanding his award winning SecurityBSides London Rookie Track talkhttps://www.securityninja.co.uk/application-security/securitybsides-london-esp-security-plugin/ to include more details about static analysis approaches and his research and development work on ESP: Security Plugin  https://github.com/diarmaid-mcmanus/ESPSecurityPlugin.
Hugh Pearse https://twitter.com/hughpearsewill be talking about Low Level Exploits and this looks like it will be a great talk:
?In 2010 Mr Haroon Meer from thinkst.compresented a timeline of memory corruption vulnerabilities and their mitigation techniques dating from 1985 to 2010. In his 35 page publication he referenced almost 150 events in low level information security history. The scope of the presentation "Low Level Exploits" is to explain in detail some of the most significant attacks in from Haroon Meers research. The attacks covered in this presentation include buffer overflows on the stack, heap overflows, integer overflows, format strings, null pointers and ROP chains. This brings us to exploits in the present day where researchers are looking for the successor of the buffer overflow attack, next big exploit.?
 
When and where?
The training and talks will be held in Realex Payment's Dublin office (address and map can be found here:http://www.realexpayments.com/about-realex/our-office-locations) on the 30th May.The training will start at 2pm so please aim to get to our office for 13:30 at the latest. The first talk will start at 6pm so please aim to get to our office for 17:30 at the latest.
 
How do I register for the training and the talks?
You will need to sign up via the OWASP Dublin Eventbrite page here:http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6665658163We do have a limited number of places available for both the training and the talks so sign up early to avoid disappointment!
 
We hope to see you in the Realex Payments office for OWASP Dublin on the 30th May.

Who could spot the devilish LOC?

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] IBM X-Force 2012 Trend and Risks Report
Message-ID: <CAE69ks6HBodq4HQn=vUfjQkWKhUZdvjdUVZ51gGC2PiweJZR7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

Please find attached detailed report from IBM on various attack trends
during 2012.

Some highlights are:

- SQL Injection and XSS remain as top web application vulnerabilities. Web
application vulnerabilities surged 14% from 2,921 vulnerabilities in 2011
to 3,551 vulnerabilities in 2012. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
accounted for over half of the total web application vulnerabilities
disclosed in 2012.

- Denial of Service attacks will remain strong in 2013. There is a
particular focus on banks and politically motivated attacks.

- Integration of mobile devices into the enterprise continues to be a
challenge. Implementing BYOD (?Bring your own device?) programs without
strict formulations of policy and governance to support the use of these
devices represent a significant risk to organizations.

- Java exploits have become key targets in 2012 and will remain in the
foreseeable future.

Have a great long weekend everyone,

Thanks,
Fabio
