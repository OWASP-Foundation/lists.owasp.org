Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] Validator for .Net
Message-ID: <8C1B61DBB6DDA241B26E151434EA760F0485AB07@irldub703nts.ie.fid-intl.com>

Anyone familiar with the commons validator for struts framework
(http://struts.apache.org/ <http://struts.apache.org/> ) may be interested
to know that foundstone (http://www.foundstone.com/
<http://www.foundstone.com/> ) are developing a .NET input validator.
The concept is to "wire" up the validator into your own .NET application.
This tool validates all input to your application for malicious characters
used for exploiting vulnerabilities.
"Writing code to check for every input field was often taxing, inefficient,
incomplete and not through. For the same reasons Microsoft provided
extensive validation framework in ASP.NET. The aim was to help developers
perform data validation routines faster and in a more efficient manner. Even
with the presence of these validators, data validations techniques are no
where near acceptable level."

Features:

	*	Provides an efficient way to apply effective data validation
techniques to existing .NET validation
	*	Does not require access to source code and therefore does
not change source code
	*	Integrates with any existing .NET web application
	*	Is composed of 2 parts
			o	Design Component, also called Configuration
Console
			o	Runtime Component
	*	Provides a centralized repository of rule set, such that
those rules can be repeatedly applied to multiple controls of the
application
	*	Allows custom rules to be written to the granularity of
every control on each form
	*	Generates a set of XML rules that can be deployed at
multiple applications 


The tool and documentation should be released next week according to
foundstone.

Regards,
Eoin

An interesting article on ID theft in the UK.
Anyone have similar information about Ireland?
Phishing attacks are commonly used for such exploits.

FYI


What Works in Web Application Security
Wednesday, March 23 at 1:00 PM EST (1800 UTC)
https://www.sans.org/webcasts/show.php?webcastid=90566
Sponsored by SPI Dynamics

One of the highest priorities for organizations doing business on the
Internet is to be able to ensure that web applications are secure.
ADP has more than 110 Internet-facing applications. Tens of thousands
of other companies depend on ADP to process their data and also need
assurance that ADP's applications are secure.  In this fascinating
interview, you'll meet the person at ADP responsible for solving this
problem and learn how he did it and what tool he found to automate
the process, and what lessons he learned along the way.


What Works To Reduce Security Vulnerabilities
Wednesday, March 30 at 1:00 PM EST (1800 UTC)
https://www.sans.org/webcasts/show.php?webcastid=90562
Sponsored by nCircle

When Bill Geimer began looking for a better way to do vulnerability
management at USAID, he was dealing with problems of weak reporting,
no remediation guidance, dated information, and critical audit
reports from the Inspector Generals Office.  Bill was able to help
USAID implement a new system that scans effectively, is designed as
an enterprise system, is easy to manage and use, and has good traffic
throttling and documented, detailed criticality ratings.   Using the
new technology, USAID has radically reduced vulnerabilities and gotten
strong support from the system administrators and their managers.

The amount of data exposed, reputation loss and cost to an exploited
enterprise is self evident.

"The thieves know the data lies in these companies' databases, and they're
going to continue to try to exploit it," Foley said. "The fact that out of
the 145,000 files stolen from ChoicePoint, that there's only been 750 cases
of ID theft reported so far, may be misleading. A lot of people still
haven't been informed that their information was compromised, or they don't
know that criminals are actively using their information to commit crimes
even as we speak." 
"...the pool of consumer data shared among criminals grows with each data
loss. He said that unless data brokers are soon held to a higher standard,
identity theft is likely to continue to grow at their expense."

Anyone familiar with the commons validator for struts framework
(http://struts.apache.org/ <http://struts.apache.org/> ) may be interested
to know that foundstone (http://www.foundstone.com/
<http://www.foundstone.com/> ) are developing a .NET input validator.
The concept is to "wire" up the validator into your own .NET application.
This tool validates all input to your application for malicious characters
used for exploiting vulnerabilities.
"Writing code to check for every input field was often taxing, inefficient,
incomplete and not through. For the same reasons Microsoft provided
extensive validation framework in ASP.NET. The aim was to help developers
perform data validation routines faster and in a more efficient manner. Even
with the presence of these validators, data validations techniques are no
where near acceptable level."

Features:

	*	Provides an efficient way to apply effective data validation
techniques to existing .NET validation
	*	Does not require access to source code and therefore does
not change source code
	*	Integrates with any existing .NET web application
	*	Is composed of 2 parts
			o	Design Component, also called Configuration
Console
			o	Runtime Component
	*	Provides a centralized repository of rule set, such that
those rules can be repeatedly applied to multiple controls of the
application
	*	Allows custom rules to be written to the granularity of
every control on each form
	*	Generates a set of XML rules that can be deployed at
multiple applications 


The tool and documentation should be released next week according to
foundstone.

Regards,
Eoin

An interesting article on ID theft in the UK.
Anyone have similar information about Ireland?
Phishing attacks are commonly used for such exploits.
