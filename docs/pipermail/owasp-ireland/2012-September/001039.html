<PRE>Hi Everyone,

Yesterday, 10gen announced new FREE online courses for educating the community on MongoDB!

You can sign up at education.10gen.com today for free MongoDB training classes, starting in mid-October. You can read more about the first two courses offered below: 

M101: MongoDB for Developers, by Richard Kreuter, Consulting Engineer, 10gen
- Learn everything you need to know to get started building a MongoDB-based app. This course will go over basic installation, JSON, schema design, querying, and working with language drivers. In the course, you will build a blogging platform, backed by MongoDB. The prerequisite for the course is knowing one of the Mongo supported programming languages.

M102: MongoDB for DBAs, Dwight Merriman, CEO, 10gen
- Learn what it takes to administer a Mongo installation in production. This course begins by assuming you have no experience with Mongo, taking you through the basics on installations. Then you will learn about JSON and Mongo's extensive  query capabilities through the Mongo shell. We will cover importing, and exporting data into Mongo and  backing up Mongo. After that it is on to scaling up with Mongo, including indexing, performance turning and monitoring, and sharding. Finally, we cover replication and fault tolerance. No prior experience with Mongo is assumed for this course but a knowledge of administration topics regarding any other database will be helpful.

Let me know if you'd be interested in forming a study group around these courses! We'd be happy to help you! 
You can check out education.10gen.com now to see more information! Best of luck getting to know MongoDB!

Fabio
