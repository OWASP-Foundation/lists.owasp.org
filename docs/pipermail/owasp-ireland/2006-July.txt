Hi Andy,
Thanks for this. I suppose the difference is that the OWASP Live CD shall 
contain all the OWASP tools and learning devices.
Also the development, testing and codereview guides. The focus is on 
application security.
But the principle isthe same.I run backtrack and Whoppix on VM ware and 
its pretty handy when required.

Hi Eoin,

Have you thought about virtualising the tools similar to the NST which
now runs on the free VMWare Player?

The .NETtools (utilising Mono to run .NET on Linux) and the application
testing guide in HTML format. 

I shall be giving out a limited amount of CD's at the OWASP AppSec 2006

Hi Andy,

 

You can always run the OWASP Live CD in vmware (as a physical cd or an iso
file) to get virtualization if you want it.

 

The live CD approach gives you both options: running directly on the
physical PC or indirectly on the virtual PC.

 

Chris

Hi Eoin

You may recall from last year that I am involved in Global Security
Week which runs each year in the week leading up to September 11th. 
This year we are running a free seminar on identity theft for
individuals and businesses alike and have speakers from the Garda
Computer Crime Unit, ENISA (the European Network and Information
Security Agency) and the Companies Registration Office.  Attached is
the press release that I sent out today which has already got some
coverage on siliconrepublic.
http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single6814

I would appreciate it if this could be send to the OWASP mailing list
to make them aware of the event.

Thanks

Brian
