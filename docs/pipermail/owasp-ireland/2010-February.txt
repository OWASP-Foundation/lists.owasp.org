*==Talk==*

*Title:* OWASP O2 Platform - Open Platform for automating application
security knowledge and workflows

*Abstract: *In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the OWASP O2 Platform which is
an open source toolkit specifically designed for developers and security
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough
'source-code-driven' application security reviews. The OWASP O2 Platform (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform) consumes results from the
scanning engines from Ounce Labs, Microsoft's CAT.NET tool, FindBugs,
CodeCrawler and AppScan DE, and also provides limited support for Fortify
and OWASP WebScarab dumps. In the past, there has been a very healthy
skepticism on the usability of Source Code analysis engines to find commonly
found vulnerablities in real world applications. This presentation will show
that with some creative and powerful tools, it IS possible to use O2 to
discover those issues. This presentation will also show O2's advanced
support for Struts and Spring MVC.

*==Presenter==*

Dinis Cruz is a Security Consultant based in London (UK) and specialized
in: ASP.NET/J2EE <http://asp.net/J2EE> Application Security, Application
Security audits and .NET Security Curriculum Development. For the past years
Dinis has focused on the field of Static Source Code analysis, from May 2007
to Dec 2009 he worked as a independent consultant for Ounce Labs (bought by
IBM in July 2009) where during active security engagements using Ounce's
technology he developed the Open Source codebase which now is the foundation
of the OWASP O2 Platform. Dinis is currently focused on making the O2
Platform the industry standard for consuming, instrumenting and data-sharing
between the multiple WebAppSec tools, the Security consultants and the final
developers. Dinis is a also active trainer on .Net security having written
and delivered courses for IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG (at
multiple locations including BlackHat), and has delivered a number of
presentations and keynote speeches at multiple OWASP and Security related
conferences. At OWASP, Dinis is the leader of the OWASP O2
Platform<http://index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform> project,
member of the OWASP Global Projects
Committee<http://index.php/Global_Projects_Committee>,
chair of the OWASP Connections
Committee<http://index.php/OWASP_Connections_Committee> and
member of the OWASP
Board<http://index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project#Global_Board_Members>.

So, with all the numerous cloud computing groups in existence the simple
idea of "awareness" is not at the forefront looking at the depatrment of
finance (link above).
Amusing piece on the irish times.

Hi,
I am considering a Capture the Flag event for the OWASP Ireland 2010
conference.
It shall be an application layer CTF within a closed network.

We have a number of options in relation to style of event and also target
CTF system. A good CTF system was used at OWASP DC which we may reuse,
Martin you like to come to Ireland to run it?

Also teams would be required to compete may I ask who would like to take
part in the competition?
It should be fun but also an opportunity for people to test their skills.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Web app security videos?
Message-ID: <20e23d921002111027u1d1ce89cu7b545b6bcbd5c782@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Just wondering if anyone can recommend any good videos on the basics of web
app security? I'm looking for something that can be shown to people as an
introduction to the topic. The videos should preferably meet the following
characteristics:

   - No more than 10 or 15 mins
   - Actual video rather than a webinar / talked-over PowerPoint
   presentation
   - Deals with basics / differences between web app security and network
   security
   - Basic introductions to topics like XSS, SQL injection, etc also welcome
   - The audience is for people with a reasonable level of technical /
   development knowledge, but minimal security experience

These would be my preferable characteristics, but if you know of something
good that doesn't quite match these, please fire it my way anyway! To give
an example of the kind of thing I was thinking about, this interview with
Jeremiah Grossman isn't too far off the mark (from 1:38 on anyway):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FdVpCm9BTM

Other than looking up YouTube, is there an obvious place I should look for
these kind of videos? Any well-known online security channels I should be
following?

Cheers!

Aidan

Hi Aidan,

You could try Security Tube which might have some videos that meet your 
requirements.

If you can't find any that meet your requirements you could always 
record your own :)

Message-ID: <f3193c101002150729w2cfd25cdvd091c32462b2c4c6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

As per Fabio's mails, Final call for the OWASP O2 workshop with Dinis Cruz
is here.
If you would like to know whats out in relation to "free tools" for code
review I believe O2 would be at the top of many peoples list.
This training is free and does not require chapter or OWASP membership.
Places limited to about 20, so there is not many left.
Ping Fabio if you would like to attend.


regards,
Eoin
