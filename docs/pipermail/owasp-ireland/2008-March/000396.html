<PRE>I fully understand that 100% security isn't realistic -  Thanks for the 
clarification though ;-)

I agree that the standard will always be ambiguous but do you not feel 
that the interpretation of the standards is often what leads to a lower 
level of security than is required?

My own opinion is that any breach like this is a big issue, from a 
consumers perspective if they have lost *any* data it should be a point 
of concern.

</I>&gt;<i> PCI has gone through a round of improvements and perhaps it will

</I>&gt;<i> other safety standard from our recent industrialised history, I

</I>&gt;<i> start off with airbags and they still don't prevent people from 
</I>&gt;<i> killing each other on country roads or on overpriced toll roads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the PCIDSS being ambiguous, I agree. However, I think this is 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps a necessary quality: Not all companies are equal. I would 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/etc wanted to establish a baseline 
</I>&gt;<i> for their own &quot;insurance&quot; purposes (imho and used here as a loose 
</I>&gt;<i> term).  Does it raise the proverbial bar? In my experience, it 
</I>&gt;<i> probably has done for some clients I've worked with and maybe not for 
</I>&gt;<i> others, but again this is an example of the underlying intention 
</I>&gt;<i> functioning (imho). Another example is BS7799/ISO17799 certification. 
</I>&gt;<i> No doubt any future attempts to provide a super-compliance-standard 
</I>&gt;<i> will end up with ambiguity too.  The point is that the organisation 
</I>&gt;<i> must interpret the &quot;ambiguity&quot; to suit their needs and explain why 
</I>&gt;<i> they have interpreted it as such to the auditor and, where applicable, 
</I>&gt;<i> compliance body.  The aim could be to provide the least amount of 
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguity as possible, but being overly prescriptive would perhaps be 
</I>&gt;<i> more prone to failure when issues such as capabilities, economics and 
</I>&gt;<i> other factors are considered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for who is to blame? I'm sure they both have insurance ... *if* no 
</I>&gt;<i> personal data was lost, is this such a big issue? (from a consumers 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective)
