A funny list produced by the ISC today on how to suck at Information
Security: http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=5644

I'm sure in our times we have seen every item on the list implemented
somewhere!

Hi everyone,

Sans today published its top 25 coding errors today, the full list can
be found here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7824939.stm

Perhaps my OWASP involvement means I'm biased but do you feel that
another list of software coding flaws is required? I quickly (so pick me
up on errors!) marked the OWASP category I felt each Sans error falls
under and it did leave me to ask the question of why do we need another
list? We will now 3 main lists (again correct me if you feel I'm missing
anything) from OWASP, White Hat Sec and Sans respectively with each
lists content different to the others.

Does this give people guidance or does it bring confusion?

My quick mapping between Sans and OWASP (A1 - 10 represent the OWASP top
10 http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007) :

CWE-20:Improper Input Validation (A2)
CWE-116:Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (A6)
CWE-89:Failure to Preserve SQL Query Structure (A2)
CWE-79:Failure to Preserve Web Page Structure (?)
CWE-78:Failure to Preserve OS Command Structure (A2)
CWE-319:Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (A9)
CWE-352:Cross-Site Request Forgery (A5)
CWE-362:Race Condition (?)
CWE-209:Error Message Information Leak (A6)
CWE-119:Failure to Constrain Operations within the Bounds of a Memory
Buffer (A2)
CWE-642:External Control of Critical State Data (A7)
CWE-73:External Control of File Name or Path (A4)
CWE-426:Untrusted Search Path (A4)
CWE-94:Failure to Control Generation of Code (A3?)
CWE-494:Download of Code Without Integrity Check (A4?)
CWE-404:Improper Resource Shutdown or Release (?)
CWE-665:Improper Initialization (?)
CWE-682:Incorrect Calculation (?)
CWE-285:Improper Access Control (A7)
CWE-327:Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (A8)
CWE-259:Hard-Coded Password (A7/A8?)
CWE-732:Insecure Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (A7)
CWE-330:Use of Insufficiently Random Values (A7?)
CWE-250:Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (A7)
CWE-602:Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security (Could lead to A1?)

Let me know what you think, and of course correct me/add to this as you
see fit.

Thanks,

Dave

Interesting thoughts.   

My initial thinking when I saw the list was that this was a good move.  In
particular given the people involved and the organisations they represent,
including OWASP. 

My main concern is that people responsible for developing, implementing and
managing code need to be made aware of the issues.  The problem though as
most of us know is that the pressure is on developers to deliver apps to
deadlines that in most cases do not provide enough time to ensure proper
development practises have been followed, never mind secure coding practise.

Therefore the more publicity and coverage any list can get has to be
welcomed.

Perhaps, following on from your thoughts it might be worthwhile for a matrix
showing the commonalities across the three lists which in turn would
highlight differences?

Just my 2c - As a disclaimer to the above I am on the Board of Editors for
the SANS NewsBites newsletter so may have a bias in favour of the work they
do.

Regards

Brian

In addition to this discussion a just to highlight a new project called the
"OWASP Code review Top 10".
It is more related to the source of vulnerabilities as opposed to the
vulnerabilities themselves (ala OWASP Top 10).

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/The_Owasp_Code_Review_Top_10_flaw_categories

A motto I have always had is "Security @ Source" which means the "makeup" of
the entity (software) must be stable and not have any "genetic defects"
(software flaws)..... Think Darwin in the software dev world. Weak software
gets compromised and infected due to inherent weakness in its conception.


Lets talk about this @ OWASP Ireland 2009 @ TCD Dublin on the 28/8/2009!!!!

Hi Brian,

I completely agree with what you have said. The more information we can
get in front of developers with regards to application security the
better, my only concern would be getting to a point where we are
providing so much information it becomes a bit confusing for people on
which one to follow (one, some, all of them etc).

I think a similar issue was discussed at the OWASP Eu Summit with
reference to the top ten and the White Hat Sec list.

I like the idea of the matrix, leave it with me and I will make one
available before the end of this week.

Thanks,

Dave

Hi,
following on from Tom Brennans email may I ask fir you consider individual
membership to our local owasp chapter.
It has been reduced to $50 for 12 months and 40% of your fee can be used for
local chapter expenses such as pizza, beer or travel expenses for speakers.

from Tom's email below:


60/40 Membership Drive effective Feb 1st 2009
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Requests to join OWASP Foundation as a organization of peers and in a
professional manner have also risen. Today there are over 2500 members
on the Linked'In business networking group close to 10,000 persons on
mailing lists and local chapters attendance is on the rise.   We have
actually reduced the individual membership fees by 50% to $50.00 usd
for a "individual" 12 month membership. To be recognized publicly as
an  "OWASP Supporter" a recommended donation of $5000.00 usd. This
category is also 100% non-profit tax deductible donation and a
optional barter program for University Supporters is available see
membership page for details.


Starting Feb 1st 2009, OWASP will "self-fund" local chapters by
revenue-splitting the collected fees 60/40. Continue to evangelize the
mission at your local chapter to both individual memberships and
supporter memberships and have them sign-up using the online form @
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership OR
https://www.owasp.org/images/4/4b/Membership.pdf if you prefer.
(Example if your local chapter drives 10 new members ($500) and 1
corporate supporters ($5,000) the local chapter would then have
$2200.00 earmarked for local chapter incurred expences. )

Hi all,

following Tom's mail I've contributed today with my 50 bucks... :)

I think the 60/40 model is great and will certainly help improve OWASP 
visibility in Ireland.

talk to you soon!

I think it is a great idea providing the money is used to help get more

I will sign up this evening!

Interesting reading, Heartland Breach: Bigger than TJX?,

http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/articles.php?art_id=1175&rf=012279eb

Heartland was compliant with PCI and certified by PCI assessor
Trustwave in April 2008.

It certainly has the potential to be bigger than TJX but no one knows
for sure at the moment. They process 100m+ transactions per month but
they aren't all affected judging by some of the press stories I have
read. As with any PSP they will process a wide range of transaction
types and I believe it was only their standard authorisation
transactions that have been affected.

Tough times for Trustwave at the moment though, they certified
Heartlands and RBS Worldpay - both have announced data breaches within
the past month.

The key point there is "certified" which is dangerous imho.
Certification pending a full blown pentest may be a better idea so "real
security" can be somewhat addressed?
OWASP has the ASVS document which is attempting to addrress levels of
security which is worth looking at.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS

PCI is "certification to trade" and in my opinion should be in addition to
other efforts to secure company and client assets :)

Thanks to everyone that has signed up to OWASP ($50) so far. This shall help
develop further guides tools, admin if the site and mail lists and also a
few ??? for chapter meeting speakers, beers and food etc.


Also a new version of the Code review guide (CRG) shall be out really soon
and I would recommend anyone involved in such things to take a quick peak.
