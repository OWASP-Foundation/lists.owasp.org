Hi All



I am looking for a security audit against a web site I am developing. I
need pricing on the following



* *

    1. *Vulnerability Assessment Test*



?         Perform a stress test on your website to check for basic
performance issues.

?         Looks for vulnerabilities and code flaws which could allow
malicious hackers access to your systems.

?         External probe of the server platform your website sits on to
check for vulnerabilities.

?         Web application flaws documented and report supplied.

?         Remedies & threat mitigation pathways advised, included in report.



    1. *Penetration Testing Service*



?         All items included in the Vulnerability Assessment above

?         Exploit research should vulnerabilities be discovered

?         'Real World' attacks conducted should vulnerabilities be
discovered in an attempt to gain system access

?         Attempts to gain access to confidential data will be made

?         Full system/network access attempts will be made to the
IP/Website ONLY.



Regards



Paddy
