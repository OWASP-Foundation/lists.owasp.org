Hello,
The App Sec conference is to be held in Belgium in May. From my own
experience the conferences are very informative and one also gets to
meet people from all walks of life.
Details can be found here.

Hi,

Very interesting and quite long list of security incidents reported under
California's computer breach laws. Quite a few breaches relate to hacking
and "exposed online" incidents.

http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/ChronDataBreaches.htm

It's certainly a list I'll be using when confronted with people saying "that
would never actually happen".

Great link Stephen
 
Interesting to note the biggest compromise was data lost while on
portable devices, be that laptops or backup tapes.  Wonder how many
of those organisations now have encryption solutions for mobile data
in place now? (or am I being too optimistic in thinking people learn
from mistakes?<g>)

Hi, 
Firstly, The OWASP AppSec Europe conference in taking place in Belgium in 
May 30th-31st. 

Details can be found at: 
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html 
The cost is small (300 Euro) and an additional course on the Friday (29th) 
is (600 Euro). 
If you are involved in application security or think you will be its well 
worth the trip. 
Drop me a mail with any questions you may have. 

We are considering moving venue for the meetings to a more flexible 
central location in the city centre, would this be more suitable for 
everyone? 
Feedback would be appreciated on this. 

Next meeting shall be in Feb/March. 

regards, 

Eoin

Hi,

Regarding VOIP there is a nice article in the register today on 
controlling botnets via SKYPE:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/26/voip_botnet_control_fears/

Also RootKits (the root of all evil) as used by SONY in their DRM attempt 
with Audio CD's, How about a BIOS rootkit!!! Now that's worrying.

Hi folks

Came across this interesting site this evening regarding the number
of PCs infected worldwide with the Blackworm, otherwise known as the
Nynex Virus, which is due to hit on Friday February 3rd. On this date
the virus is programmed to delete a series of Microsoft files such as
Word documents etc. from the infected PCs. Despite some media
coverage saying this virus has infected 5 million PCs worldwide the
figure appears to be nearer 300,000. This site shows those figures
and provides a country by country breakdown of the number of hosts
infected. As you can see the statistics show there are 263 hosts
infected within Ireland. While 300,000 is not as high a number of
infected PCs as 5 million, it is still a significant figure and poses
a risk to PCs that do not have the latest anti-virus signatures
installed.
