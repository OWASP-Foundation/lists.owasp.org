Hi Everyone,

Due to demand for this event we've had to change the venue to accommodate
more people. The meeting will now be in the *Hilton Hotel, Charlemont
place* (opposite
the Barge pub) in Ranalegh (Chalemont Luas stop). The Hilton is
approximately a 10 minute walk along the canal from the original location
and a short walk from the city center.

Courtesy of Ward Solution, Kontex Security and Symantec, we have a number
of gifts that we will be giving away as part of the event which include an
iPad, Samsung tablet, Play Station 4 and some smaller items.

Please note that currently there is a Luas strike planned for the evening
of the 26th May, so we will start at 7pm.

We're really looking forward to the event so hope to see you there. Please
share the event with friends and colleagues as it's an open event and the
more the merrier.

Hi Everyone,

ISACA Ireland have released a 'call for papers' for their annual conference
on 11th November in Croke Park. This year the theme is ?cultivating a
culture of security? and they are seeking skilled, knowledgeable and
accomplished speakers!

We'd encourage submissions from the OWASP community as much of the work

culture of security" within organisations and teams.

Many Thanks,

Tony.

Message-ID: <CABkSbXgT8OvGoMCdX67CJAgrRt3MY87et_9kcBgWbuUVxhT1XA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I'd like to mark the successful event last night organised primarily by our
new chapter lead Tony Clarke, if I may.
It was probably the best chapter event ever held (in the chapters 10 year
history) with a high proportion of female attendees. - very cool!!
Keynote speaker stories of "how they got here" were an inspiration.

It was also great to see all the new faces/committee members "mucking in"
and helping run the event.

The event was streamed on facebook, twitter was very active, The event was
also recorded which I think should take centre stage on the OWASP.org site.

Thanks to all the panel members and speakers, the event sponsors;
