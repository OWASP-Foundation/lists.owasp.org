<PRE>Hey Chapter,

Souds like a good event.....(and debate)....

I don't believe open source is of any higher risk than closed..... (Think
Linux, Struts, Spring)

1. There are more reviewers, users. Issues ted to be caught quicker (for
more popular projects).
2. The code can be reviewed by anyone.
3. The communities are generally larger.
4. The software foodchain is easier to track than closed source.

But there is a risk of

1. Online-line dependencies in the build process - E.g. Maven downloading
dependencies in realtime. (&quot;cool&quot; name is XBI - Cross build Injection).
<A HREF="https://www.fortify.com/downloads2/public/fortify_attacking_the_build.pdf">https://www.fortify.com/downloads2/public/fortify_attacking_the_build.pdf</A>
(from 2007)

2. Not checking check sums (MD5 may be used but is weaker day by day)

Recently (a few moths ago) I reviewed (closed) code for a client for
security (Secure code review). It was developed by a third party. I found 4
issues, all loading obfuscated code from a jar dependency (renamed
ojdbc14.jar to look like an oracle jar). One of which was a Mailer which
sent HTML form submission data to a &quot;funny&quot; range of email addresses. It
would not of worked as port 25, 465 etc was blocked on the firewall in this
case (phew).

See you all on the 8th for beers!!!
