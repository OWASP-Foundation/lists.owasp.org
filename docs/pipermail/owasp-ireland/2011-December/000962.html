<PRE>*Upcoming webcast: Open to Trouble: The Risks of Open Source Code in
Application Development*


If you&#8217;re developing your own software and applications or having that
process outsourced, chances are good that open source code is being used.
While there are benefits from using open source code, there is also
significant downside. How does a security department manage the technical
and operational risks, regulatory/compliance issues and security and brand
concerns the use of open source code can expose an organization to? Join
(ISC)2 and Black Duck Software for our final ThinkTank Roundtable of 2011
on December 15, 2011 at 12:00 noon Eastern time as we examine these risks
and issues

Any questions, please let me know.


Thanks,


Fabio
