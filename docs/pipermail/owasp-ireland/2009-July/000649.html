<PRE>Hi everyone,

I just wanted to send out a reminder for tomorrow nights chapter 
meeting. Full details of the speakers and location can be found below 
and on the OWASP Ireland Chapter page 
(<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland#tab=Chapter_Meetings">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland#tab=Chapter_Meetings</A>).


      Agenda

Next Meeting 23rd July

Venue: Ernst &amp; Young, Harcourt Street

Time: 18:30

*Speakers*:

*Niall Jordan (Realex Payments)*

*Evading SQL injection detection through encoding*

The purpose of this presentation is to give a basic understanding of how 
character set encoding can be used to evade common SQL injection 
detection techniques. It will start with a brief introduction to 
character set encoding to give the viewer the necessary overview to 
adequately understand the attack vectors. It will then move on to 
quickly describe normal SQL injection techniques and their detection and 
then go into detail on using character set encoding to bypass 
conventional detection methods. Practical examples will be shown along 
with methods to prevent these attacks.

*Colin Watson (Watson Hall)*

*Software Assurance Maturity Model 1.0*

he Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is now an OWASP project and 
in March became release quality. What is software assurance? What is a 
maturity model? What is SAMM? The presentation will explain how SAMM can 
be used to assess and improve software development security practices, 
reducing security risk and increasing software assurance, in all sizes 
of organisation.

Colin Watson's initial work was in the production and process 
engineering fields, but since completing an MSc in Computation at the 
University of Oxford in 1995, he has been employed in web software 
development, with an increasing focus on the security aspects. He is now 
a consultant, based mainly in London, working with developers, testers, 
auditors and people from a non-IT background to improve security 
practices. Colin joined the OWASP Global Industry Committee in January 
2009.
