<PRE>I didn't upgrade to XP, it came with the laptop. I didn't have a walkman 
either! If you take those two examples Dave they both (98 to XP and 
Walman to iPod) had very clear benefits to upgrading, I fail to see 
these clear benefits when it comes to the web browser.

I understand that technology evolves but I see no real evidence as to 
why a user should (must in some people's eyes) move away from IE6. If 
people cite security as a reason then I certainly won't buy that one, as 
I have mentioned several times all of the other browsers released since 
IE6 have had security issues and continue to do so until this day.

I'm happy to have my mind changed if anyone can provide a good answer to 
one question:

Why should someone upgrade from IE6?

No one has given a straight answer on that one yet :)
