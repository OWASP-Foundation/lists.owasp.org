Dear Security Professional,

Please join us for Community SANS Dublin at the Ballsbridge Court Hotel,
7-15 September 2009. <A HREF="http://www.sans.org/info/46188">http://www.sans.org/info/46188</A>

Here is the program lineup and what SANS alumni have said about the
courses:

7-12 September
SEC504: Hacker Techniques, Exploits &amp; Incident Handling by Robert McArdle
This course will creep you out first then empower you - military style
- first break you down then build you up,&quot; Mark de Rijk, 4 Infosec

14-15 September
AUD521: Meeting the Minimum: PCI/DSS 1.2: Becoming and Staying Compliant by
Owen Connolly
&quot;I wish I took this class a year ago! PCI went from being a pain to
something that will be a lot easier to manage.&quot; Steve Marriott,
Hummingbird Coaching

What is Community SANS

The Community SANS format in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa
Region) offers the most popular SANS courses in your community and in
your local language or in English. The classroom setting is small with
fewer than 25 students. The instructors are high-scoring GIAC
certification holders pulled from the best of the local mentor program
or security experts in your local community who have passed SANS
rigorous screening process called the murder boards. The course material
is delivered over a six-day period, and the course content is the same
as ones provided at a larger training event. Depending on the course,
the instructor may add relative information such as local laws and
regulations, and bring cases and examples with local flavor. Not only
will you be able to use the skills that you learned as soon as you
return to the office, but you will be able to continue to network with
colleagues in your community that you meet at the training.

COST SAVINGS:  Is the slowing economy resulting in reduced training
budgets?  With the Community SANS program, you save 15% off the regular
SANS tuition fee.

TUITION DISCOUNTS!
SANS offers group registration discounts for 4 or more students who
register from the same organization.  To obtain the Group Discount fee
and Registration Code offered for this course, contact Barbara Basalgete
at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-ireland">bbasalgete at sans.org</A> PRIOR to registering, and provide the names and
e-mail addresses of all the students registering within your
organization.
