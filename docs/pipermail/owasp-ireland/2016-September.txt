Hi Everyone,

Thanks to everyone who came to the OWASP Dublin session yesterday evening.
We had some excellent sessions from Simon Singh, Professor Mike Scott,

especially thank the following organisations:

   - Island Networks
   - Integrity360
   - Asystec Data Management
   - Kontex Security
   - Symantec

Feel free to let us know what you thought of the event and to suggest
events you would like to see. We will make some video of yesterdays event
available in the coming days.

Enjoy the weekend.

Thanks,

Tony
