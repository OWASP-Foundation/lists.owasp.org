<PRE>Hi all,

On Thursday November 12th we have two great speakers lined up for our next
chapter meeting. Both posses great experience in their respective areas, so
can get across the information and answer your questions that might not be
so easy to find in the books. Stephen O'Boyle will talk about PCI DSS
(Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standard), the set of compliance
guidelines that you must adhere to if you store, transmit or process credit
card information. This will be followed up with Barry Mulcahy's valuable
information on management of identity and access to data across systems.

Also, thanks to the kind sponsorship from Espion on the night there will be
some food and drinks provided too. No doubt, this should be a great night :)

*Talk #1 - PCI DSS v3.1 Scanning and Penetration Testing*

you can maintain compliance.

&#8729;  PCI DSS Pentest / Scanning overview

&#8729;  Migrating from V2 to V3.1

&#8729;  Changes to penetration testing requirement 11.3

&#8729;  Scanning vs pen testing

&#8729;  What the auditor expects from pen testing

&#8729;  Example methodology

*Talk #2 - Identity and Access Management (IAM)*

This talk will focus on Identity and Access Management (IAM), what it is
and how it fits into the security landscape. It will outline the lifecycle
of an identity (Hello new hire Alice!). How we move from having an identity
to having access. Some of the common pitfalls encountered during IAM
integration projects. Analytics techniques for IAM that smooth the
integration path, validate controls and provide valuable Business
