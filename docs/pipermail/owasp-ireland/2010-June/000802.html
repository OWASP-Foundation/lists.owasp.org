<PRE>Hi everyone,

I've been working on creating a tool which will help people carry out 
security code reviews and I wondered if a few of the people on this 
mailing list wanted to try it out. The tool isn't fully complete yet but 
the core code review functionality is so you should be able to try that 
part out.

I'm really looking for a few people to give some feedback on the tool in 
general, find any bugs and of course try to break it ;-)

You can find more information on the tool here: 
<A HREF="http://www.securityninja.co.uk/the-security-ninja-code-review-tool-update">http://www.securityninja.co.uk/the-security-ninja-code-review-tool-update</A>

If you would like to have a play with it then drop me an email and we 
can sort something out.

Dave
