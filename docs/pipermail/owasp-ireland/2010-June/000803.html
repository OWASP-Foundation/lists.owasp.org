<PRE>Just a quick note to say thanks for all the responses! The first 10 
people who contacted me should have received an email with more 
information this morning, I don't need any more volunteers for now :)

Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> I've been working on creating a tool which will help people carry out 
</I>&gt;<i> security code reviews and I wondered if a few of the people on this 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list wanted to try it out. The tool isn't fully complete yet but 
</I>&gt;<i> the core code review functionality is so you should be able to try that 
</I>&gt;<i> part out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really looking for a few people to give some feedback on the tool in 
</I>&gt;<i> general, find any bugs and of course try to break it ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can find more information on the tool here:

</I>&gt;<i> If you would like to have a play with it then drop me an email and we 
</I>&gt;<i> can sort something out.
