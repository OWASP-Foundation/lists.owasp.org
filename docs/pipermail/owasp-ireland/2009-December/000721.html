<PRE>Dear all,

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and give you a 
little background to my decision to become the new OWASP Ireland Chapter 
Lead.

I'm currently working as an Information Security Specialist at AIB and my 
whole career has been focused in building, reviewing and securing software 
applications in the finance, software, government and manufacturing 
industries. I have been involved with OWASP first as an OWASP 
Internationalization promoter - which I'm still actively doing - and more 
recently as part of the Global Education Committee providing awareness, 
training and educational services to corporate, government and educational 
institutions on application security.

Based in recent conversations with Eoin I thought the time was right to 
accept the challenge of leading a chapter and at the same time share some 
of my experience with the OWASP Irish community since I'm living here for 
almost 5 years.

Also, as you might have noticed we have decided to form an OWASP Ireland 
Chapter Board composed by Eoin, Rahim and myself.

The idea behind this change is not only to strenghten the ties with all of 
you, but also to outreach the wider developer community across Ireland.

For years we have watched as the software market fails to produce secure 
applications. I believe it is our responsability as OWASP members to help 
&quot;raise the bar&quot; in application security and I'd like to encourage you to 
achieve that goal in your team, company, industry or local university.

Obviously that doesn't mean we cannot share some free pints, pizzas and 
networking events during the process... :-) 

I'm looking forward to meet with each of you this evening during the OWASP 
Ireland Xmas Event @ The Odeon Pub, Harcourt Street.

And if you cannot make it to the event... please feel free to send me your 
ideas/questions anytime at:
