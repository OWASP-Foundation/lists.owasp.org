*OWASP Ireland Xmas Event*:

*Announcing the OWASP Ireland Xmas get2gether.

You are invited to attend a informal gathering of OWASP chapter members to
reflect on the previous year and also to look forward to 2010

*When: 8th December 2009, The Odeon Pub, Harcourt Street.,*

The Ireland chapter board have secured (limited) funding for some free beer
(not bad for open source).

This is to celebrate the announcement of our new chapter lead:

reviewing and securing software applications in the finance, software,
government and manufacturing industries. He is heavily involved with OWASP
as part of the Global Education Committee providing awareness, training and
educational services to corporate, government and educational institutions
on application security. Due to his diverse background (Argentinean born,
Italian spirit) he evangelizes the internationalization of OWASP tools &amp;
materials across the world. He holds a Msc in Information Technology from
the Catholic University of Buenos Aires, Argentina and is a Certified

&amp; *Eoin Keary *
(OWASP Global Board member)
I am also happy to say Funding from the OWASP Ireland event (2009) has come
through such that in 2010 we have a budget for any ideas which you may have.
(Flying speakers over, Pizza, Networking events etc) Feel free to suggest
anything on your mind.
