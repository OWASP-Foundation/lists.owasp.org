*Abstract:*

Every year the security community produces a stunning number of new Web
hacking techniques that are published in various white papers, blog posts,
magazine articles, mailing list emails, conference presentations, etc.
Within the thousands of pages are the latest ways to attack websites, Web
browsers, Web proxies, and their mobile platform equivalents. Beyond
individual vulnerabilities with CVE numbers or system compromises, we are
solely focused on new and creative methods of Web-based attack. Now in its
eighth year, the Top 10 Web Hacking Techniques list encourages information
sharing, provides a centralized knowledge base, and recognizes researchers
who contribute excellent work.

In this talk, We will do a technical deep dive and take you through the Top
10 Web Hacks of 2013 as picked by an expert panel of judges.

This year&#8217;s winners are:

1 - Mario Heiderich &#8211; Mutation XSS
2 - Angelo Prado, Neal Harris, Yoel Gluck &#8211; BREACH
3 - Pixel Perfect Timing Attacks with HTML5
4 - Lucky 13 Attack
5 - Weaknesses in RC4
6 - Timur Yunusov and Alexey Osipov &#8211; XML Out of Band Data Retrieval
7 - Million Browser Botnet
8 - Large Scale Detection of DOM based XSS
9 - Tor Hidden-Service Passive De-Cloaking
10 - HTML5 Hard Disk Filler&#8482; API
