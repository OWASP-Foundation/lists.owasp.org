Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to stupidity.

I'm excited! Was the "a lot done, a lot more to do" part of the
previous, or previous-1, campaign? If the previous, I wonder what
other delights we can look forward to?

Technology hub of Europe, me ****.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Vista EULA
Message-ID: <f3193c100610310540l427c2afeub1090dbae2614a57@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
theregister.co.uk has an article on the MS Vista EULA. It seems to have some
interesting points such as benchmarking and testing restrictions.
Restrictions on .NET testing which would make security research on Vista,
which is not inline with MS requirements, be a violation on the EULA.
Michael Howard, you did not mention this in Seattle. Is this meant to make
Vista more secure?

any thoughts?
Eoin
