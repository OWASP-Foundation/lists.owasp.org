Hi,
I am looking for Spring of code team members  for the code review guide.
I have submitted a proposal which can bee seen here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007_Applications#.7BYour_first_name_or_Alias.7D_-_.7BProject_name.7D

What we need is a number of people that would dedicate themselves to writing
a chapter (or more) in the code review guide.
If the proposal is  accepted I hope to secure some funding for this project
also which shall benefit contributors on a pro-rata basis.

If you would like to contribute to the code review project drop me a mail
suggesting what you would like to do.

The current code review chapters assigned can be found here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapters_Assigned
but this may change as there is not much activity on the wiki to reflect the
assigned work. So feel free to suggest working on any area of the guide.
There is always room for improvement.



Thanks,

-ek
