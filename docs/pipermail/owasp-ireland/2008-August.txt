Message-ID: <48AAF357.8040801@realexpayments.com>

Hi all,

The final version of version 1.2 of the PCI DSS hasn't been published
yet but a summary document detailing some of the upcoming changes can be
found here:
https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/supporting_documents.shtml

There isn't anything major being changed, I will leave you to decided
whether that is good or bad :-)

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Surf Jack - HTTPS will not save you
Message-ID: <OF35C343A9.8730FC7F-ON802574A3.0036E6E6-802574A3.003764B1@dice.aib.pri>

Say hello to a new security tool called "Surf Jack" which demonstrates a 
security flaw found in various public sites. The proof of concept tool 
allows testers to steal session cookies on HTTP and HTTPS sites that do 
not set the Cookie secure flag.

Tool: http://surfjack.googlecode.com/
Short paper: 
http://resources.enablesecurity.com/resources/Surf%20Jacking.pdf
Screencast: http://www.vimeo.com/1507697 - very illustrative on how to do 
it.

This research was done independently from Mike Perry's[1], but it appears 
to be effectively the same thing.
