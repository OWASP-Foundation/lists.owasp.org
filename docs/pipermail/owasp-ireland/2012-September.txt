Hi folks,

Just wondering if anyone knows why the Xenotix XSS Exploitation Framework
looks so horrible in VirusTotal:

Thanks a bunch,

My guess would be the payloads such as the key logger are triggering AV 
signatures.

I've had similar happen to me before where a presentation I gave was 
setting off AV alerts because I had included malicious javascript in one 
of the slides.

Hey Dave, thanks for the reply.

Yeah, that was my initial thought, too. However, I think it's odd that the
AV vendors have only been flagging the file as malicious in the last 8
hours or so, this seems to coincide with a new version of the file being
added to the download section of the page. Perhaps something's changed in
this version (unencrypted payloads?)

Anyways, I only bring it up as I'd be wary that owasp.org will start being
added to malicious domain blacklists. It looks like GSB has already
detected the "trojan", our maldomain crawler has also suggested blocking
owasp.org on our corpnet - not ideal!

Thanks again,
Eoin

Message-ID: <CAE69ks7-GK1Oi=1ou0ijX6mQ3h2yXidAqqcZ7NUF1iDKqOXafw@mail.gmail.com>

hi there,

This week everybody is talking about a CRIME attack against TLS to be
presented at the EkoParty conference in Buenos Aires by Juliano Rizzo and
Thai Duong (same crowd who won the ?Top Ten Web Hacking Techniques? for
both 2011 and 2010 for their work on BEAST and the Padding Oracle? Crypto
Attack). Here is an introduction to the talk:

?Researchers have identified a security weakness that allows them to hijack
web browser sessions even when they?re protected by the HTTPS encryption
that banks and e-commerce sites use to prevent snooping on sensitive
transactions.?

Already caught your attention right? Well, I'm sharing below a few blog
articles explaining possible causes on how this attack could be
accomplished with live demo included.

*Blog post by Whitehat explaining different attack scenarios:
*http://blog.whitehatsec.com/crime-mitm-and-xss/
*
Blog post by Cigital explaining potential problem with the TLS algorithm:*

*Demo of the CRIME TLS Attack:

Happy Friday!

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Free MongoDB training
Message-ID: <8C39CDD0-605E-48A6-89E4-90201CD24224@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone,

Yesterday, 10gen announced new FREE online courses for educating the community on MongoDB!

You can sign up at education.10gen.com today for free MongoDB training classes, starting in mid-October. You can read more about the first two courses offered below: 

M101: MongoDB for Developers, by Richard Kreuter, Consulting Engineer, 10gen
- Learn everything you need to know to get started building a MongoDB-based app. This course will go over basic installation, JSON, schema design, querying, and working with language drivers. In the course, you will build a blogging platform, backed by MongoDB. The prerequisite for the course is knowing one of the Mongo supported programming languages.

M102: MongoDB for DBAs, Dwight Merriman, CEO, 10gen
- Learn what it takes to administer a Mongo installation in production. This course begins by assuming you have no experience with Mongo, taking you through the basics on installations. Then you will learn about JSON and Mongo's extensive  query capabilities through the Mongo shell. We will cover importing, and exporting data into Mongo and  backing up Mongo. After that it is on to scaling up with Mongo, including indexing, performance turning and monitoring, and sharding. Finally, we cover replication and fault tolerance. No prior experience with Mongo is assumed for this course but a knowledge of administration topics regarding any other database will be helpful.

Let me know if you'd be interested in forming a study group around these courses! We'd be happy to help you! 
You can check out education.10gen.com now to see more information! Best of luck getting to know MongoDB!

Fabio
