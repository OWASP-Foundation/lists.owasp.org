*Managing Risk in an Ever-Changing Threat Landscape*

*31 March 2015  |  Engineers, Ireland*

We are pleased to announce that (ISC)? is bringing its acclaimed
SecureEvents Series to Ireland for the first time!

Managing, even understanding, information security risks today requires an
unwavering focus on the objectives of the business and the strategy for
achieving its mission. Sessions explore the threat landscape and its
drivers, the common security pitfalls endemic to current business trends,
and how to express these threats ? and their countermeasures ? in a way
that the business can comprehend and act upon.

Importantly, sessions covering the solutions will provide an overview of
the innovations and practical developments to enhance risk management. By
working to enhance your perspective on how business is developing, not just
security, this conference offers a real opportunity to step back from the
technology, develop the right perspective, and then consider the most
effective tactics and solutions that can be applied.
