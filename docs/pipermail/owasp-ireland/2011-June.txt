2011 CWE/SANS Top 25 Voting Ballot (Deadline June 24)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on input from 13 individuals and 4 public top-N lists, we have
drawn up a "Nominee List" of 41 CWE entries for this year's Top 25 (by
coincidence, this is the same number of nominees as last year!) ?A
separate message will explain how the nominee list was created.

>From your votes, a final ranked list will be derived, becoming the
official 2011 Top 25. ?We will leverage CWSS
(http://cwe.mitre.org/cwss) to evaluate the final scores for the
weaknesses. ?Votes will be based on Technical Impact, Prevalence, and
Likelihood of Exploit.

Please vote on all 41 of these nominees! ?Please email your response
to coley at mitre.org.

Preferred Deadline: Wednesday, June 22, 12 PM (Pacific time)

FINAL Deadline: Friday, June 24, 12 PM (Pacific time)

Public Release: Monday, June 27, 1 PM (Eastern)


Thank you,
Steve and Bob



Voting Instructions
-------------------

The ballot has been divided into different groups to facilitate
readability.

Please fill in all 41 nominees. ?For those that do not affect your
environment, choose "Low" prevalence and say "default" for both
technical impact and likelihood of exploit.

Each CWE entry lists Prevalence, Technical Impact, and Likelihood of
Exploit, along with the acceptable values. ?(See detailed explanation
below). ?You can provide your vote after the listed factor, e.g.:

??PREVALENCE:

??Widespread

??TECHNICAL IMPACT:

??Medium

??LIKELIHOOD OF EXPLOIT:

??Low


Send your ballot to coley at mitre.org when you are finished.


------------------------------
Reduced Restrictions on Voting
------------------------------

In 2010, there were several restrictions on voting that have been
removed for 2011:

- You are not limited in how many times you select the most
??significant value (e.g. "widespread" prevalence).

- A single organization can provide multiple votes, provided each
??sub-organization has different areas of responsibility (e.g.,
??different product divisions at a software developer, or different
??analytical techniques used by consultants).



---------------------------
Evaluating Technical Impact
---------------------------

Criterion: For each "project" (whether a software package, pen test,
???????????educational effort, etc.), what is the potential result
???????????that could be produced if an attacker is able to
???????????successfully exploit the weakness?


* Critical - complete control over the software, the data it
?????????????processes, and the environment in which it runs (e.g. the
?????????????host system), to the point where operations cannot take
?????????????place.

* High - significant control over the software, the data it processes,
?????????or the environment in which it runs, to the point where
?????????operations are significantly limited.

* Medium - partial control over the software, the data it processes,
?????????or the environment in which it runs, in which some operations
?????????may be limited.

* Low - minimal control over the software, the data it processes, or
????????the environment, with limited or no impact on operations.


---------------------
Evaluating Prevalence
---------------------

Due to the limited amount of real-world data available for evaluating
rates of occurrence of weaknesses, this option is expressed in a more
general sense.

Criterion: For each "project" (whether a software package, pen test,
???????????educational effort, etc.), how often does this weakness
???????????occur or otherwise pose a problem?


* Widespread - The weakness is found in most or all software in the
??associated environment, and may occur multiple times within the same
??software package.

* High - The weakness is encountered very often, but it is not
??widespread.

* Common - this weakness is encountered periodically.

* Limited - this weakness is encountered rarely, or never.


--------------------------------
Evaluating Likelihood of Exploit
--------------------------------

Criterion: For each "project" (whether a software package, pen test,
???????????educational effort, etc.), what is the likelihood that an
???????????attacker will exploit the weakness? ?(Assume that the
???????????attacker has already discovered it.)


* High - It is highly likely that an attacker would target this
??weakness successfully, with a reliable exploit that is easy to
??develop.

* Medium - An attacker would probably target this weakness
??successfully, but the chances of success might vary, or require
??multiple attempts to succeed.

* Low - An attacker probably would not target this weakness, or could
??have very limited chances of success.

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] Penetration testing practicum
Message-ID: <BANLkTim-xZvZTM8EcTaMHZeCCj++j+cxwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm doing a practicum for my course in DCU on the area of penetration
testing for web applications. I thought this would be a good place to tell
about it since it concerns web application security.

I plan to investigate and examine the current tools/frameworks available to
pen-testers out now, and their effectiveness in sample tests against some
web services. Right now, I have the sample Hacme services available from
Foundstone ( http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/index.aspx ).
Since these are intentionally filled with potential exploits, they are the
best web services to test these tools on.

What I plan to do is the following:

1. Develop my own process for penetration testing. From my research I do not
see a standard approach to this. I am currently going through and plan to
use some aspects of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard in
this, as well as the OWASP Top 10 in my attempt to develop an approach to
testing.

2. Test these sample web services with two tools, w3af and Metasploit Pro.
W3af ( http://w3af.sourceforge.net/ ) is open source tool, while Metasploit
Pro ( http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit-pro.jsp ) is a commercial
tool.

3. Test the web services using the approach I developed.

4. Compare the results of all 3 methods used.

During the process of this I will be researching and studying everything
security related for web applications so I should come out the other end
with some good knowledge of web app exploits, how to run a pentest

Is there anything obvious that I am missing that should be in a study of
penetration testing of web applications and its available tools?

Would anyone be interested in the results from this investigation?

Thanks,

Brian

Hi Brian,
ASVS is a great start as the OWASP Top 10 was never and is not a standard
but a survey with lots of great data and remediation hanging off of it.
The OWASP Testing guide may help with you developing an approach. Many
approaches are not shared as they are considered internal information.
Last time I looked metasploit is not a pure web app sec tool but rather a
exploit tool with some nice auxillary scanners etc.

Burp Proxy and Zap are very common web proxies used in industry today
coupled with commercial tools such as IBM Appscan, HP Webinspect or Cenzic
hailstorm not to forget Netsparker but to name a few.

The more mature approach is secure coding, development process and code
review coupled with runtime testing.
Industry is realising that a pen test alone is not enough as it does not
cover all aspects.

Also the idea of scanning for known vulnerabilities vs fault injection these
are different concepts.
Many free/Open source tools do not do "known vulnerabilities" as well if at
all as this requires constant rule base updating as new issues are
discovered and the developers focus on improving accuracy of the result
parsing and injection rather than making new rules to reproduce an exploit.

Hi Eoin,

Thanks for the help. I will take a look at the OWASP Testing guide for help
with developing an approach. The reason I chose Metasploit was that it is a
paid framework that does web application scanning and vulnerability
scanning. I was planning to compare its effectiveness to w3af, but perhaps I
should choose another framework than Metasploit if it does not do exactly
what I am looking for. I will have a look at the other tools you mentioned
and give them a shot.

Thanks,
Brian

Hi Brian,

Burp is a commercial tool that costs like $150 and would be a really good
tool to start with if you wanted to make the comparison between free and
commercial tools..There has just been a new version released which has
incorporated allot of the functionality that has been missing for a long
time. Cenzic is also a more robust automated solution. I have a contact
there who could possibly give you a few weeks trial if you were interested.
He might see the benefit to the company of your research.

Owen

Hi Owen,

Thanks for the info. Burp seems like an interesting tool that I could use
for this research, as does Cenzic. For the purpose of penetration testing, I
have w3af as the open source framework. I would need at least 1 other tool
to use as a comparison so I will check both these tools out over the next
day or two and make a choice on what ones I want to use for this.

Being a student with limited experience in this area it'll take a few
attempts before I find the right tools to use for this, but I'll check these
ones out!

Thanks,
Brian

Hello Brian,

I would love to see the results of that research!

There are some other significant tools to add to the list, they are
used widely in the pentesting assesments: Google skipfish, Nikto and
Nessus. The first two are open source and the last one it was free but
now it is commercial.

In my opinion, if you are going to rely on the reports of the tools,
the more tools you use, the better. Note that every tool results
should be checked by an experienced pentester to avoid false
positives. Also it should be complemented with some manual pentesting
as well.

Regards.

Javier.

Hi Brian,

Burp is a commercial tool that costs like $150 and would be a really good
tool to start with if you wanted to make the comparison between free and
commercial tools..There has just been a new version released which has
incorporated allot of the functionality that has been missing for a long
time. Cenzic is also a more robust automated solution. I have a contact
there who could possibly give you a few weeks trial if you were interested.
He might see the benefit to the company of your research.

Owen
