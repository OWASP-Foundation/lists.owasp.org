*Session 1 &#8211; Hugh Jones - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)*
With the current EU legislation passing its 20th year back in October, it
is high time that the EU Data Protection regime caught up with everything
that is happening in the commercial, technological and social media
sectors. The EU Commission has recently published the final draft of the
new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), scheduled to take effect
across the EU in early 2018.

For organisations who already have a culture of DP compliance in place, the
new Regulation will introduce a few changes, but nothing particularly
challenging. For those who have ignored or failed to step up to the 1995
Directive, the next two years could be a very busy time indeed! This
overview of the Regulation provides an understanding of the key concepts
contained in the new legislation, the main areas of change, and some good
advice on the steps which organisations need to take in order to prepare in
a timely and organised manner. The key motto being: &#8220;Don&#8217;t Panic!&#8221;&#8221;

*Session 2 &#8211; Working in IT Security*
A panel of experts will discuss what it is like to work in IT Security
industry in Ireland. The aim is of this session is to give the audience an
overview of the different types of roles and opportunities in IT Security

aspect of IT Security.
