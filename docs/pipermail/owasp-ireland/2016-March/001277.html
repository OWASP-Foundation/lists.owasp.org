<PRE>Hello everyone,

Over the past couple of months we the Dublin board have been working on
improving our reach within the community. We have noted that in order to do
this the board as a group need to be more involved in promoting OWASP's
mission.

To this end, two of our long serving board members Fabio Cerullo and Mark
Denihan have decided to step down and allow others within the community get
involved. We would like to thank them for their volunteer efforts and hope
they can be still involved in some capacity for years to come.

We would like to take this opportunity to ask those interested in becoming
part of the OWASP board to help drive OWASP within the local community to
step forward and contact myself, Eoin Keary and Tony Clarke.

We're particularly interested in ensuring gender equality and would
encourage female members of the community to get in contact and would also
encourage individuals from outside pure application security such as
individuals with a development or infrastructure background to become more
involved.

We would also welcome others who would like to assist the OWASP Dublin
chapter in other capacity with organising events or other outreach
activities.

We look forward to hearing from you.

OWASP Dublin Board
