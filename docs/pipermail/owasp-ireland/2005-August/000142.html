Hi Folks

&quot;Announcing Global Security Week in Ireland

Global Security Week is a global security awareness initiative in the
week leading up to September 11th every year.  The idea is simply to
coordinate and encourage a wide variety of security-related awareness
activities worldwide in that week, taking advantage of the obvious
focus on security by the world's media. 

Global Security Week is a public awareness initiative, not a
commercial or political venture. We are not trying to obtain funding,
de-rail other security awareness activities, nor focus on any
particular aspect of security (such as terrorism, information
security or physical security).  Global Security Week is deliberately
designed to be a broadly-scoped event but with a long-term aim to
become the main focus for security awareness activities in years to
come. 

BH Consulting are proud to be involved with Global Security Week and
details of our involvement with Global Security Week can be found on
our website at <A HREF="http://www.bhconsulting.ie/global_security_week.htm.">http://www.bhconsulting.ie/global_security_week.htm.</A> 
More information is also available at
<A HREF="http://www.globalsecurityweek.com.">http://www.globalsecurityweek.com.</A>  

As IT Security professionals we should be promoting better security
awareness.  If you wish to participate in Global Security Week, have
any suggestions on events or ways to promote the campaign or require
more information on this worthwhile initiative, please visit the
Global Security Week website or contact me at any of the contact
points below.&quot;
