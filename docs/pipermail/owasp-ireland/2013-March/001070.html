<PRE>Hey,
How many are signed up for tonight?

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to IrishDev.com and Barry for providing this fantastic venue!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Workshop 1 - **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Topic: &quot;Everything we know is Wrong&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  (17:00-18:00)
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> The premise behind this talk is to challenge both the technical controls
</I>&gt;<i> we recommend to developers and also out actual approach to testing. This
</I>&gt;<i> talk is sure to challenge the status quo of web security today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different
</I>&gt;<i> results.&quot; - Albert Einstein
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We continue to rely on a &#8220;pentest&#8221; to secure our applications. Why do we
</I>&gt;<i> think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application to
</I>&gt;<i> help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100 times
</I>&gt;<i> longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability? Our testing
</I>&gt;<i> methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the tools
</I>&gt;<i> they use. Some carpenters use glue and some use nails when building a
</I>&gt;<i> wooden house. Which is best and why do we accept poor inconsistent quality.
</I>&gt;<i> Fire and forget scanners won&#8217;t solve security issues. Attackers take time
</I>&gt;<i> and skill but our industry accepts the output of a software programme to
</I>&gt;<i> help ensure security? How can we expect developers to listen to security
</I>&gt;<i> consultants when the consultant has never written a line of code?  Why
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t we ask &#8216;How much code development have you done, seen as you are
</I>&gt;<i> assessing my code for security bugs?&quot; Currently we treat vulnerabilities
</I>&gt;<i> like XSS and SQLI as different issues but the root causes it the same. &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> it&#8217;s all code injection theory!! Why do we do this and make security bugs
</I>&gt;<i> over complex? Why are we still happy with &#8220;Testing security out&#8221; rather
</I>&gt;<i> than the more superior &#8220;building security in&#8221;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eoin has recently delivered this at RSA (Feb 2013) in San Francisco and
</I>&gt;<i> Semafor (March 2013) in Poland to great effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *BIO:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eoin is international board member and vice chair of OWASP, The Open Web
</I>&gt;<i> Application Security Project (owasp.org). During his time in OWASP he has
</I>&gt;<i> lead the OWASP Testing and Security Code Review Guides and also contributed
</I>&gt;<i> to OWASP SAMM, and the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series. Eoin Keary is the CTO and
</I>&gt;<i> founder of BCC Risk Advisory Ltd. (www.bccriskadvisory.com) an Irish
</I>&gt;<i> company who specialise in secure application development, advisory,
</I>&gt;<i> penetration testing, Mobile &amp; Cloud security and training. Eoin has led
</I>&gt;<i> global security engagements for some of the world&#8217;s largest financial
</I>&gt;<i> services and consumer products companies. He is a well-known technical
</I>&gt;<i> leader in industry in the area of software security and penetration testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Workshop 2 - Topic: &quot;ABAP Code Vulnerabilities - What Your SAP System
</I>&gt;<i> May Be Hiding&quot; (18:00-19:00)
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> ABAP is a programming language developed for use within SAP platforms to
</I>&gt;<i> allow customers to develop their own business applications. However,
</I>&gt;<i> because the majority of ABAP developers code exclusively for applications
</I>&gt;<i> that are internal only applications and because these are accessed through
</I>&gt;<i> the SAP GUI client, rather than web based technologies, many developers
</I>&gt;<i> believe that application security vulnerabilities either do not exist, or
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be exploited within their code. This session aims to dispel this
</I>&gt;<i> myth and will provide a demonstration of some of the common vulnerabilities
</I>&gt;<i> that exist within ABAP code, such as SQL injection, ABAP code injection, OS
</I>&gt;<i> command injection and path traversal and show how these issues are
</I>&gt;<i> exploited through the SAP GUI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Bio:*
</I>&gt;<i> M&#225;irt&#237;n is a manager within the PwC Information Security and Forensics
</I>&gt;<i> function with ten years experience in information security. M&#225;irt&#237;n began
</I>&gt;<i> his career in network security and then moved to a broader information
</I>&gt;<i> security role before moving into consultancy where he has worked for
</I>&gt;<i> clients in Ireland, the UK and Europe across all domains of information
</I>&gt;<i> security. M&#225;irt&#237;n&#8217;s key focuses are on management and delivery of
</I>&gt;<i> information risk, information security management, information security
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, compliance, vulnerability management and penetration testing
</I>&gt;<i> engagements.
</I>&gt;<i> M&#225;irt&#237;n has extensive experience providing application security testing
</I>&gt;<i> services for complex web applications and platforms in the public and
</I>&gt;<i> private sector and has recently been responsible for the implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> a secure software development lifecycle within an organisation of over
</I>&gt;<i> twelve hundred developers.
