<PRE>Dear all,

We would kindly like to invite you to the upcoming OWASP Dublin event *next
Thursday 14th March at 17:00* (registration opens at 16:30) in the *TCube *at
32-34 Castle St, Dublin.

Thanks to IrishDev.com and Barry for providing this fantastic venue!

*Workshop 1 - **

Topic: &quot;Everything we know is Wrong&quot;
 (17:00-18:00)
*
The premise behind this talk is to challenge both the technical controls we
recommend to developers and also out actual approach to testing. This talk
is sure to challenge the status quo of web security today.

&quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different
results.&quot; - Albert Einstein

We continue to rely on a &#8220;pentest&#8221; to secure our applications. Why do we
think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application to
help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100 times
longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability? Our testing
methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the tools
they use. Some carpenters use glue and some use nails when building a
wooden house. Which is best and why do we accept poor inconsistent quality.
Fire and forget scanners won&#8217;t solve security issues. Attackers take time
and skill but our industry accepts the output of a software programme to
help ensure security? How can we expect developers to listen to security
consultants when the consultant has never written a line of code?  Why
don&#8217;t we ask &#8216;How much code development have you done, seen as you are
assessing my code for security bugs?&quot; Currently we treat vulnerabilities
like XSS and SQLI as different issues but the root causes it the same. &#8211;
it&#8217;s all code injection theory!! Why do we do this and make security bugs
over complex? Why are we still happy with &#8220;Testing security out&#8221; rather
than the more superior &#8220;building security in&#8221;?

Eoin has recently delivered this at RSA (Feb 2013) in San Francisco and
Semafor (March 2013) in Poland to great effect.

*BIO:*

Eoin is international board member and vice chair of OWASP, The Open Web
Application Security Project (owasp.org). During his time in OWASP he has
lead the OWASP Testing and Security Code Review Guides and also contributed
to OWASP SAMM, and the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series. Eoin Keary is the CTO and
founder of BCC Risk Advisory Ltd. (www.bccriskadvisory.com) an Irish
company who specialise in secure application development, advisory,
penetration testing, Mobile &amp; Cloud security and training. Eoin has led
global security engagements for some of the world&#8217;s largest financial
services and consumer products companies. He is a well-known technical
leader in industry in the area of software security and penetration testing.

*Workshop 2 - Topic: &quot;ABAP Code Vulnerabilities - What Your SAP System May
Be Hiding&quot; (18:00-19:00)
*
ABAP is a programming language developed for use within SAP platforms to
allow customers to develop their own business applications. However,
because the majority of ABAP developers code exclusively for applications
that are internal only applications and because these are accessed through
the SAP GUI client, rather than web based technologies, many developers
believe that application security vulnerabilities either do not exist, or
cannot be exploited within their code. This session aims to dispel this
myth and will provide a demonstration of some of the common vulnerabilities
that exist within ABAP code, such as SQL injection, ABAP code injection, OS
command injection and path traversal and show how these issues are
exploited through the SAP GUI.

*Bio:*
M&#225;irt&#237;n is a manager within the PwC Information Security and Forensics
function with ten years experience in information security. M&#225;irt&#237;n began
his career in network security and then moved to a broader information
security role before moving into consultancy where he has worked for
clients in Ireland, the UK and Europe across all domains of information
security. M&#225;irt&#237;n&#8217;s key focuses are on management and delivery of
information risk, information security management, information security
architecture, compliance, vulnerability management and penetration testing
engagements.
M&#225;irt&#237;n has extensive experience providing application security testing
services for complex web applications and platforms in the public and
private sector and has recently been responsible for the implementation of
a secure software development lifecycle within an organisation of over
twelve hundred developers.
