Hi,
Some corporations are thinking of using Skype togo the VOIP route and
reduce cost.
Skype ~= Kazaa = File sharing

And now file stealing........

Hi All,

I'm newly arrived in Dublin!

Agreed that I would not want it on my network, Skype seems contain a
high level of obfustication and possibly evilness.

For those that missed it there was an excellent presentation on Skype at
the March 06 BH, well worth a read:

Hi,

We are just back from the conference in Belgium. May I say it was a success.
About 150 people attended the beautiful town of Leuven.
Key points:

OWASP have appointed an Executive Director, Andrew Van Der Stock which
should help the group as a whole for the following reasons,

Transparency -
The foundation shall have the ability to publish annual financial reports.
The organisation and management of the foundation shall be more transparent.
Contributors shall get more direction and possibly funding for their time.

Democracy -
Members shall get voting rights and a say in the direction OWASP takes.

If you wish to be a member please follow the link attached
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership

The presentations (which are many) shall be available on the new WIKI site.

Help is also required for a number of Pen Testing related projects,
drop me a line if interested.

One more thing,
would you prefer if we held the meetings in a pub more central in Dublin?

Hello,

A new OWASP project is the CALL9000 workbench.
Its a Javascript tool, best run on firefox but uses the XMLHTTPObject (ala 
AJAX)to give it some extra beef!
It is also to be included in the OWASP Live CD
It can be found, Here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_CAL9000_Project

Worth a look IMHO.

It is also planned to demonstrate this tool and the new and improved 
webgoat at the OWASP chapter September meeting (TBA).

regards,
Eoin
