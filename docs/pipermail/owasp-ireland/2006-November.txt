"PIN entry must be performed in such a way that cashiers, checkout
attendants, customers, and people nearby cannot easily observe the PIN
during entry by the cardholder. Therefore, PCI requires that the PIN entry
device be equipped with proper shielding protection for privacy - "to
provide a means to deter the visual observation of the PIN values as they
are being entered by the cardholder," '
=20
Is a little at odds with the 25% shoulder surf statistic Eoin commented on
earlier in the week.=20
=20
Maybe card companies should ask restaurant staff that use the handhelds how
often they see the entire pin of the customer, (without actually trying).
Remember its not something they can look away from as they generally have to
walk the customer through the new process and of course make sure that the
customer leaves a tip at the appropriate stage when paying!
(In our line of work its very good to be negative.....in a positive kind of
way.)

Hi Tony,

=20

In general, the requirements for the "privacy shield" for pin entry devices
were relaxed since PCI PED superseded Visa's VisaPED specs.=20

Germany, having the most stringent PED security requirements in
Europe/worldwide, has not relaxed their requirements.

=20

AFAIK, this relaxation is partly related to accessibility and disability
requirements/specifications.

=20

PCI PED and VisaPED specify things like the minimum angle from the '5' key
(5 being the middle key on the keypad) to the top of the wall of the privacy
shield above and to the sides of the '5' key.

=20

For handheld terminals, the requirements for the privacy shield are also
relaxed - the rationale being that the user can use their body as a shield
when they are holding the terminal.

=20

See VisaPED section 3.4 Privacy Shield Requirement:
http://international.visa.com/fb/vendors/pin/Visa_PED_Program_Guide.pdf for
more info.

Hi,

 One thing that really bugs me about the new chip and pin system is way in
which the pin is entered. Some of the terminals such as those in
supermarkets offer little in the way of privacy when inputting the pin. Up
to now pins have been mostly used at ATM's where your body is a good
physical screen, but now usually the terminal is between you and the
retailer, more often than not in plain view of other cusomers too.=20

A step back for pin security???

"PIN entry must be performed in such a way that cashiers, checkout
attendants, customers, and people nearby cannot easily observe the PIN
during entry by the cardholder. Therefore, PCI requires that the PIN entry
device be equipped with proper shielding protection for privacy - "to
provide a means to deter the visual observation of the PIN values as they
are being entered by the cardholder," '

 

Is a little at odds with the 25% shoulder surf statistic Eoin commented on
earlier in the week. 

 

Maybe card companies should ask restaurant staff that use the handhelds how
often they see the entire pin of the customer, (without actually trying).
Remember its not something they can look away from as they generally have to
walk the customer through the new process and of course make sure that the
customer leaves a tip at the appropriate stage when paying!

(In our line of work its very good to be negative.....in a positive kind of
way.)

Hi Tony,

 

In general, the requirements for the "privacy shield" for pin entry devices
were relaxed since PCI PED superseded Visa's VisaPED specs. 

Germany, having the most stringent PED security requirements in
Europe/worldwide, has not relaxed their requirements.

 

AFAIK, this relaxation is partly related to accessibility and disability
requirements/specifications.

 

PCI PED and VisaPED specify things like the minimum angle from the '5' key
(5 being the middle key on the keypad) to the top of the wall of the privacy
shield above and to the sides of the '5' key.

 

For handheld terminals, the requirements for the privacy shield are also
relaxed - the rationale being that the user can use their body as a shield
when they are holding the terminal.

 

See VisaPED section 3.4 Privacy Shield Requirement:
http://international.visa.com/fb/vendors/pin/Visa_PED_Program_Guide.pdf
<http://international.visa.com/fb/vendors/pin/Visa_PED_Program_Guide.pdf>
for more info.

Hi,

 One thing that really bugs me about the new chip and pin system is way in
which the pin is entered. Some of the terminals such as those in
supermarkets offer little in the way of privacy when inputting the pin. Up
to now pins have been mostly used at ATM's where your body is a good
physical screen, but now usually the terminal is between you and the
retailer, more often than not in plain view of other cusomers too. 

A step back for pin security???

BBC has an article on Chip and Pin and the affect it has had on card fraud,
as mentioned by Chris at his PCI presentation last meeting. 
- might be "marketing guff"? Chris, any comments?

Hi Tony,
=20
In general, the requirements for the "privacy shield" for pin entry=20
devices were relaxed since PCI PED superseded Visa's VisaPED specs.=20
Germany, having the most stringent PED security requirements in=20
Europe/worldwide, has not relaxed their requirements.
=20
AFAIK, this relaxation is partly related to accessibility and disability=20
requirements/specifications.
=20
PCI PED and VisaPED specify things like the minimum angle from the '5' key =

(5 being the middle key on the keypad) to the top of the wall of the=20
privacy shield above and to the sides of the '5' key.
=20
For handheld terminals, the requirements for the privacy shield are also=20
relaxed - the rationale being that the user can use their body as a shield =

when they are holding the terminal.
=20
See VisaPED section 3.4 Privacy Shield Requirement:=20

Software
Presenter:  Barmak Meftah

Abstract: This presentation focuses on turning abstract software security=20
theories into practical steps that you can use to develop and deploy=20
measurably more secure software. The key to solving the software security=20
problem is getting started. Away from broad process re-engineering and=20
silver-bullet technologies, the session focuses on practical actions that=20
every organization can take today. The steps are based on real-world=20
examples and cover the development process from upfront risk assessment to =

post-deployment. Artifacts of the steps, including checklists and software =

security metrics will be reviewed and discussed.

Title: Application Defense ? Software That  Fights Back=20
Presenter: Barmak Meftah

Abstract:  In the last decade, the majority of security breaches occurred=20
when networks were broken into directly. Today, however, most security=20
threats and exploits derive from hackers maliciously manipulating software =

applications, without ever breaching perimeter network defenses.  The=20
reality is that software applications have changed little to address these =

new software-based attack strategies.  This presentation explores a new=20
and rich field: software application forensics and countermeasures. By=20
using real-world examples, this session will define and demonstrate=20
technical topics like attack surface, pattern recognition, tracers and=20
method guards. The audience will leave with an understanding of=20
cutting-edge techniques for strengthening software code and preparing for=20
business discussions about liability and post-intrusion investigation.=20
This session will also investigate common preventative and forensic tools=20
such as intrusion detection systems and application firewalls.


This meeting shall be well worth attending, especially for those involved=20
in development, so tell your colleagues.
Drop me a line or call my cell if you require any further information

Anyone wishing to attend please drop me a line as we need a list of=20
attendees for security purposes :)

best regards,
hoping to see you there,

Eoin Keary.
OWASP Chapter founder & Lead.
