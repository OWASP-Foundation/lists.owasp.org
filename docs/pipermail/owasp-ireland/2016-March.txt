Hi All,

I've been asked to share the 25% discount code again. The organiser has
updated the ticket prices with the discount code still applying for all
OWASP members. Please see below

The Cyber Startup Summit has been designed to enhance knowledge sharing
across enterprise, academic, startup and investment communities whilst
advocating the need for targeted innovation and new startups in cyber
security.

Summit> http://cyberstartupsummit.com/
25% discount code is: *CSS2016owasp*

Subject: [Owasp-ireland] OWASP Cork: Deserialization is bad,
	and you should feel bad
Message-ID: <CALLx+DtuCxt88Z6B3j7Ez9XQ2ABbK9EKg_O0-G0YaMMjf=eivw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The next OWASP Cork chapter meeting will be delivered on Monday 14th March
by Gabriel Lawrence <https://twitter.com/gebl> who will be speaking about
object deserialization bugs within some of the most popular programming
languages, web servers and sites. This is a major application security
vulnerability for which he and Chris Frohoff advanced the research and
released generalized exploit tools <https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial>
at AppSec Cali 2015
<http://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/>. It was almost a
year later, when specific working exploits were released across many major
Java services
<http://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/>,
that the world realized how much of a big deal the findings from their
research into deserialization was. Sites including PayPal
<http://www.pcworld.com/article/3026678/paypal-is-the-latest-victim-of-java-deserialization-bugs-in-web-apps.html>and
a number of Java based systems including WebLogic, Websphere, JBoss and
Jenkins were found to be remotely exploitable to provide the attacker with
full remote access to the associated server. To this day, and without a
doubt well into the future, desearialization vulnerabilities will continue
to be discovered as a result of this work.

Gabriel Lawrence leads the Application Security team at Qualcomm
<https://www.qualcomm.com/>, San Diego, doing Application Security
Assessments, Penetration Tests, Incident Response, Reverse Engineering, and
anything else that comes his way. Gabe is an active member of the very
successful San Diego OWASP Chapter
<http://www.meetup.com/Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-San-Diego-OWASP-SD/>
and has been involved with OWASP as an organization from the time of its
inception.

This promises to be an interesting and exciting talk. Beer and pizza will
also be provided - bring all your friends :)

The talk will be held at The Roundy, Cork City and you can sign up here:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/229340488/
<http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/229340488/>

Looking forward to seeing you there,
Darren & Fiona (OWASP Cork Team)

Yea, should be really good. The work had a pretty massive impact and it's
cool stuff.

Slides will be up on the Cork Wiki <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cork>

*Session 1 ? Hugh Jones - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)*
With the current EU legislation passing its 20th year back in October, it
is high time that the EU Data Protection regime caught up with everything
that is happening in the commercial, technological and social media
sectors. The EU Commission has recently published the final draft of the
new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), scheduled to take effect
across the EU in early 2018.

For organisations who already have a culture of DP compliance in place, the
new Regulation will introduce a few changes, but nothing particularly
challenging. For those who have ignored or failed to step up to the 1995
Directive, the next two years could be a very busy time indeed! This
overview of the Regulation provides an understanding of the key concepts
contained in the new legislation, the main areas of change, and some good
advice on the steps which organisations need to take in order to prepare in
a timely and organised manner. The key motto being: ?Don?t Panic!??

*Session 2 ? Working in IT Security*
A panel of experts will discuss what it is like to work in IT Security
industry in Ireland. The aim is of this session is to give the audience an
overview of the different types of roles and opportunities in IT Security
and afford the audience an opportunity to ask questions in relation to any
aspect of IT Security.

Message-ID: <CACH=f5bqSkW_4kscRujn6QqeRbhpjnoyYtVgpAkpoH8VbDme9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Over the past couple of months we the Dublin board have been working on
improving our reach within the community. We have noted that in order to do
this the board as a group need to be more involved in promoting OWASP's
mission.

To this end, two of our long serving board members Fabio Cerullo and Mark
Denihan have decided to step down and allow others within the community get
involved. We would like to thank them for their volunteer efforts and hope
they can be still involved in some capacity for years to come.

We would like to take this opportunity to ask those interested in becoming
part of the OWASP board to help drive OWASP within the local community to
step forward and contact myself, Eoin Keary and Tony Clarke.

We're particularly interested in ensuring gender equality and would
encourage female members of the community to get in contact and would also
encourage individuals from outside pure application security such as
individuals with a development or infrastructure background to become more
involved.

We would also welcome others who would like to assist the OWASP Dublin
chapter in other capacity with organising events or other outreach
activities.

We look forward to hearing from you.
