Hi,
as you may know the guide it virtually finished (for now) and one thing I
wish to do is get it translated.
Currently I have a person to translate to Spanish
French and German would also be nice, so if you wish to volunteer please do
so.
regards,

Hi,
Just a note to say that the PDF & doc versions of the testing guide are
available on the Testing site.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project

I'd like to congratulate all involved in this effort, well done, as this is
a key deliverable for the OWASP foundation.

I'd like to ask if people would take a quick read of the book and supply
feedback on the good, bad and ugly. :)
If anyone has any comments or suggestions please mail the list over the
coming weeks as we can incorporate any tweaks prior to the official guide
release date in February.

thanks again,
Eoin

Hi (again),

anyone in the Irish chapter interested i working on the Code review guide?
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project#Contents

I hope to get this as part of the Spring of Code (SoC) project held in OWASP
(TBA).
This would mean that if successfull there would be some funding to support
our time (Like the Testing Guide autumn of Code).
If you have some Secure development knowledge and would like to contribute
to the worlds first open source code review guide please let me know.

cheers,
Eoin

(Sorry about the typos, keyboard is knackered).

Subject: BETA Release of OWASP LiveCD ready for testing!!!!!
To: owasp-livecd at lists.owasp.org
Cc: Eoin <eoinkeary at gmail.com>


 Summary:
OWASP LiveCD is ready to download. This distro is Beta Version 0.8 named
"LabRat" and is part of the OWASP Autumn of Code sponsorship. The distro is
focused on providing all of OWASP tools and documents on a bootable CD. The
goal is to have a portable distro that can be used by professional
penetration testers,security admins, Students, or anyone interested in
computer security to perform work,training, or research. All you have to do
is burn the .ISO to DVD or start under Vmware/Virtual PC and you will have a
full Linux desktop environment loaded with OWASP tools and
documents.Anotherinstant advantage is that the CD can be distributed
within testing teams and
new hires to ensure everyone has the same tools without spending a week
setting up a laptop. Same scenario applies for students learning computer
security. The CD contains the WebGoat application designed for learning
about application vulnerabilities utilizing easy to follow lessons.( Version
5 will be included this month)


Details:
I finally got back from holidays and spent the weekend to finish up the BETA
version of the CD. It's quite large right now weighing in at 802mb so it's
just big enough to use a DVD and not a CD. This will be much smaller once
the first round of testing has been completed. The current release v08 seems
to be fairly stable and works on most platforms I have tested on. When the
CD boots up you will notice that all the OWASP tools and docs have icons on
the desktop and can also be found in the programs menu. What I tried to do
was follow the current OWASP  naming convention -Releases,Beta, and Alpha.This
keeps everything organized and also helps adding new tools and documents.

Issues:
The CD is stable but I'm not having problems starting WebGoat v4 again for
some reason. I had this working all weekend and on several versions I made
yesterday- However, when I burned the final Beta version it stopped for some
reason. ( I may have corrupted a permission or something when I was chrooted
back into the filesystem.)

What's Next?
I have not added tools yet other than OWASP docs and tools. Once the OWASP
material is added and verified the specialty tools such as VOIP, RFID, and
Wireless will be added.

BETA TESTERS:
We encourage everyone to download the .ISO and give us feedback on what we
can do to make it better. Also, what tools or docs would you like to have on
the CD? The URL to the mailing list is owasp-livecd at lists.owasp.org  . I can
also be contacted directly - livecd at packetfocus.com

Download:
The distro can be downloaded from the PacketFocus website (
http://packetfocus.com/hackos/AOC_Labrat-ALPHA-0008.iso) ((800mb)) After you
download it just burn it to a DVD or use something like Vmware server to try
it out. Vmware is a free download now (www.vmware.com)


This project was sponsored by OWASP Autumn of Code 2006.

Hi,
I have been informed that the Testing Guide is now used by the department of
Homeland Security (DHA) in the US.
They informed us that the Software Assurance department in the DHA is using
it as a guide to assessing web applications.
It is nice to see our work being adopted by agencies as a standard and
thanks to all involved for your effort.

regards,

Eoin
