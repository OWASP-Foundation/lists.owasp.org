Subject: [Owasp-ireland] [Owasp-leaders] Phishing rises by 8000%,
	Breach in UCLA
Message-ID: <02E766F69AF6AC48B9CF52ABC0DA11E101DD7838@MERCEDES.utopiasystems.net>

 

The UCLA incident is a good example to discuss Dinis mail about
collaborating with the Web Hacking Incidents Database Project (WHID,
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid) which I lead. 

 

This is a very high profile incident, but we only have tiniest of clues
as to how it was done (from the article Eoin sent: "the hacker used an
unspecified (and as yet undetermined) application vulnerability to gain
access to systems"). In many cases we don't even get this much
information. 

 

WHID lists only incidents that are certain to have occurred due to web
application vulnerabilities, as the goal is to show that these are a
real problem. Others track security incidents in general, defacements,
or information leakage incidents. 

 

I could use your help to get information (just publicly available
please) that ties security incidents to web applications
vulnerabilities.

 

Thanks

~ Ofer

Elint and to some extend humint have increased drastically, and  cooperative intelligence networks are yieliding ridiculously fast response times.
