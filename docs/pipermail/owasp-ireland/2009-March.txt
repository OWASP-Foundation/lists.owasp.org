"Should we lobby our TD's for California style disclosure laws?"

As a lurker on this list, could I make my first response in answer to
this question. I strongly believe that the time is now right for Ireland
to make the first EU country move in this area. A working group has been
set up to look at the legal issues of mandatory data reporting -
http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/WP09000015

Submissions may be made to dataprotectionreview at justice.ie by the
beginning of March 2009.

Sadly, no members of the information security community appear to have
been included on this list. I'm not sure if the deadline for submissions
is 1st March, but I would naturally encourage any submissions, however
brief from this group. The process of consultation seems to be quite
weak, I would have expected a draft paper to be produced and submissions
sought on the content of the paper and the wider implications. Perhaps
that will be done, but in the interim, there is this window of
opportunity to make the communities voice heard.

Actually it wasn't the report itself I was commenting on, rather the
article
on darkreading which was referencing the report. So apologies if it
seemed I
was diminishing the report itself. The fact that the article didn't
qualify
the source and scope of the data leads you to believe that these are
statistics which are compiled from a large data pool.
The choice on which areas to concentrate current attention within web
application security is a valuable one. The OWASP top ten list for
example
is a good effort in this direction. What would make this approach all
the
more valuable would be good quality statistics on a wide data pool that
would help us all understand the nature of the threat environment and
therefore help us to defend our applications.
I thought the perhaps OWASP as an organisation could consider becoming
an
advocate/lobby group to goverenments and the EU for mandatory reporting
to
national data comissioners. These data comissioners could anonomously
compile the statistics and publish them at national or EU level. If this
data was available on this scale I think it would greatly help improve
the
overall level of threat knowledge. Just my two bits though (1,0).

 Conor.

As someone who has been lobbying for mandatory reporting I would caution
though that this will not be the silver bullet to our lack of statistics.  

Firstly we have to ensure that any laws introduced into these area are
balanced and thought out properly.  Badly thought our laws will be worse
than no laws at all.  My thoughts on mandatory breach disclosure (for what
they are worth<g>) are available in an article I wrote for the Law Gazette
(http://url.ie/197y page 20).

I also echo Richard's concerns that no-one from the information Security
profession is not involved in the data protection review committee and
voiced those concerns at the recent NITEs seminar.

If we introduce such a law we need to consider what people are obliged to
report, breaches involving personal data, web site defacements, leak of
confidential company data etc.?  We need to be cognisant that any breach is
also a criminal act.  Based on those two issues is it appropriate to report
a crime to the Data Protection Commissioner?

One of the reasons I set up Ireland's first national CSIRT, www.iriss.ie,
was to provide a platform for companies to report breaches in confidence so
others could learn from their mistakes.  Companies can chose to share their
issues anonymously if they so wish.

As Richard highlights in his email the Data Protection review commission is
taking submissions.  This is "up to March" so there may be time for people
to share their thoughts.  I have submitted my proposals to the commission
and would encourage others, whether you support mandatory breach disclosure
or not, to submit your own thoughts.

Regards

Brian

Message-ID: <49ACF13E.4010206@realexpayments.com>

Hi Eoin/List,

I just wanted to throw a question out there based on some questions I've
received recently about chapter meetings. I was wondering if we planned
on making the chapter meetings more frequent than we had in 2008? I
think we only had 2 in the whole year (correct me if I'm wrong) and I
feel it would be more beneficial to have them more frequently, every 2-3
months?

What does everyone else think?

Dave

Hi Dave,
Thanks for the question.

If individuals wish to have more meetings please ask and suggest topics,
offer to present themselves etc. OWASP is about contribution, community and
action and we have always asked what people would like to do?
We can even secure some funding for speakers from foreign lands if there is
a consensus for a individual speaker to be invited to Dublin.

"Ask not, what my chapter can do for me, but, what can I do for my chapter"

Hi Eoin,

I couldn't agree more with that statement Eoin:

"Ask not, what my chapter can do for me, but, what can I do for my chapter"

It would very nice to have more people suggest topics and present them
during chapter meetings!

Could we propose a date for the next meeting then and hopefully some
people will come forward with topic suggestions/volunteering to present?

Hi Eoin,

The folks at IRISS CERT (Ireland's first CSIRT) would like to give a short 
presentation on IRISS at some this year - assuming of course there's some 
interest in that?

Cheers..Mark

Hi Dave,
Thanks for the question.
 
If individuals wish to have more meetings please ask and suggest topics, 
offer to present themselves etc. OWASP is about contribution, 
community and action and we have always asked what people would like to 
do?
We can even secure some funding for speakers from foreign lands if there 
is a consensus for a individual speaker to be invited to Dublin.

chapter" :)

Hi Eoin/List,

I just wanted to throw a question out there based on some questions I've
received recently about chapter meetings. I was wondering if we planned
on making the chapter meetings more frequent than we had in 2008? I
think we only had 2 in the whole year (correct me if I'm wrong) and I
feel it would be more beneficial to have them more frequently, every 2-3
months?

What does everyone else think?

Dave

How about Blind SQL injection? I think you gave a quick overview of it
at the last chapter meeting Eoin but it would be good to have a
presentation just on that topic.

All the suggestions so far sound good to me. Eoin would you be able to
give an update on the plans for OWASP Ireland 2009? It would be
interesting to hear what is likely to be covered. It may even lead to
some discussions around interesting presentation topics.

David,
I'd gladly tell you what I know regarding the OWASP Ireland 2009 Event:

Confirmed International Speakers:

Rogan Dawes (Corsaire) Title:HTTP Caching

Andreas Fuchsberger (Microsoft) Title: TBA

Danny Allan (IBM)  Title: TBA

Justin Clarke (Gotham Digital Science) Title: TBA

Tom Brennan (OWASP) Title: "OWASP State of the Nation"

Dave Wichers (OWASP) Title: "Tales from the Battlefield" - .Net/Java
Security

Arturo 'Buanzo' Busleiman Title: PGP Egniform

Prof. Ian Angell (LSE)  Title: TBA

Marco Morana Title: "Threat Modeling"

Other speakers have to be confirmed and also we have a number of great local
speakers.

I am organising training sessions and depending on interest they should
consist of full-day sessions on the 9th (Day prior to the event).

Food/Beer/Milk is organised. :)

Free OWASP materials are be be supplied to attendees such as books, etc.

Afternoon all,

Breaking news in France is that 4 laptops containing "plans and codes" for a
new prison due to open shortly were stolen late last month:

http://news.google.fr/news?pz=1&ned=fr&ncl=dRiY_Tqiy148G1MwasISf1zoKyUvM

Here's the translated silicon.fr
article<http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&hl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.silicon.fr%2Ffr%2Fnews%2F2009%2F03%2F09%2Fnancy____prison_break__a_la_francaise&sl=fr&tl=en>-
sounds like they were targeted too.

Yet another data point for how security works in the real
world<http://xkcd.com/538/>

Hi Martin,

I use a different maturity model to that one (slightly different goals 
to be fair).  I use ISM3 (http://www.ism3.com/) which is more for 
overall security and not just for development which I think the BSI 
model is?

Hi everyone

I just wanted to share some information with you all. I was doing some 
research for a presentation last week and I came across a flaw in 
Facebook, in short it allows you to access any users photo albums 
without being a friend, being given the public link directly, being in a 
group with them, being logged in etc etc

The full details can be found here: http://securityninja.co.uk/blog/?p=198

A while back a subordinate commented on my summer vacation, which was
perplexing given that I had specifically created an album on Facebook and
shared it with a select group of friends and family *before* uploading
photos soley so that these would be kept private.

It took me a while to work it out, but the Facebook Exporter for iPhoto (and
possibly other applications using the same APIs) was resetting the ACLs on
the album when uploading to it.

At the time I was pissed, but also too busy to write about it or indeed even
report it. I soon enough deleted all my albums though and haven't uploaded
anything even moderately interesting since. I recommend others do the same.

Hi Liam,

Thanks for the link. I was looking at that same issue (had never seen

albums), I'm not sure if its quicker but we can definitely access entire 
albums :-)
