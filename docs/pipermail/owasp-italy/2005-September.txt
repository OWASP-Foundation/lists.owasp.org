Subject: Early Registration Ending Soon: 2nd US OWASP AppSec
Conference - Oct 11-12 - Near DC
To: webappsec at lists.securityfocus.com


I just wanted to remind everyone that early registration for the OWASP
conference ends on Sept 9th (this Friday). On Sept 10. the registration fee
will increase by $50 for both Standard and Government registrants. Full
details on the conference are available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc.html

Also, I have been informed by the staff at NIST that there will be NO ONSITE
REGISTRATION. Thus, you must register for the conference by Oct 10th via the
website. We then have to provide a list of registrants to the Guards at
NIST. You will be required to provide them with picture ID. If you are on
the registration list, they will then let you enter the facility to the
conference building where you can pick up your conference badge.

Also, the training class on Oct 10, the day before the conference, is almost
full so I encourage anyone interested in signing up to do so soon. If there
are enough registrants over the course max, we might open up a second
offering of the class at the same date and location. However, we need to
decide this soon so we can reserve the room. So please register for the
course as soon as possible if you are interested to ensure you get a spot.

Registration info from previous announcements repeated below:

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a non-profit charitable organization, and with
NIST's sponsorship, OWASP has been able to keep the cost to $300 per seat if
you are able to register prior to Sept. 10, 2005. The cost to government
employees is only $250 prior to Sept. 10th.

Registration information is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/docroot/owasp/Registration/index.jsp

PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL TICKETS ARE NON REFUNDABLE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATION
COSTS

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE - Oct 10: OWASP has arranged to
have a one-day hands on Web Application Security training course the day
prior to the conference. This one day class will be held at the nearby
Holiday Inn and is only $600 for conference attendees. Registration for this
course can be done via the conference registration page.

More details on this training course is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc/training.html

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - Oct 11: An optional dinner event is being held at the
Holiday Inn Gaithersburg, which is the same location where the training is
to be held on the 10th, and where discounted rooms are being made available
to all conference attendees (see Accommodations below).

This event involves a dinner at the hotel from 7-9 PM, followed by drinks at
O'Malley's Irish Pub right in the hotel or out by the hotel's indoor pool
adjacent to the pub. We hope to see all of you there as this is a great
chance to mingle and meet many members of the OWASP community.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you all
there!

Thanks, Dave

Hi all,
SysCheck v2.1 is a free tool run on win32 OS pick up at

http://www.soluzionepa.it/hometranet/syscheck_download.html

The product has a lot of features, including:

SysCheck is a desktop application designed to load test functional behavior, 
measure performance and WebSite related, helpfull tools.

SiteCheck:

SiteCheck is a powerful utility which lets you check your WebServers and 
their services.
It detect if their content has changed after the "Acquire" section or has 
become unavailable.
Also, you can be advised when your favorite Internet pages has updated.
An ability to check HTTP or FTP sites for changes.
Automatically check the URLs and change their icons when the original 
response become different. Also is ready for a valid Defeacement Alarm.
Visual, audio and LOG notification if content change.
Click on the icon for modify item.
Use the Start/Stop button to manage the service.

SiteSpeed*:

SiteSpeed is an easy-to-use tool that simulates Internet traffic and 
provides developers with precise real-time information on site performance.
In today?s Internet environment, where speed is of the utmost importance, 
SiteSpeed delivers meaningful test results in just minutes.
It may be used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources 
(files or CGI, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java Objects).
The performance test start when you flag the "Test performance" checkbox 
option, if not you can have back the Header and the Page source of the Web 
Server.
The Overload Index coming out pushed by the green columns and cutted by the 
red, specifically the first green give one point, the second green give 1/2 
point and the third green give 1/3 of point, also the first red cut one 
point, the second red cut two points and finally the last red column leave 
three points.


SiteStress*:

With this you can finally know how many users can simultaney load your 
WebServer.
The "Stress" button start calling the URL page in a rolling close sequence.
Check the "Get graphics" to do the same thing of previous, but is more 
invasive because get all graphics of the page called.
The number of users is calculated by this expression User = one PageView 
every 10 seconds.

SiteCompare*:

Sometimes we need to know the page load performance.
You can compare two site and look the difference, use the clear cache option 
to have the exact time/load.
Be sure to use one test at time, when the first URL has finished, begin the 
other one, finally you can compare the average time.

*This tool operate good only with a direct connection to internet, bandwith 
is a factor that change the test results.
