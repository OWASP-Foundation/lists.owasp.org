International Workshop on Modelling and Detection of 

Vulnerabilities
(MDV 2010)

In conjunction with ICST 2010
Third International Conference on

Introduction 
--------------------------------------
With the quick proliferation of complex, open and distributed 

systems, any software security breach becomes a real issue that 

needs to be fixed since these systems are often used in critical 

domains like transport, finance, politic, etc which makes 

attackers more and more motivated to cause important damages by 

exploiting security vulnerabilities. 

To improve the software security, several techniques have been 

developed but the problem remains unsolved. The objective of this 

workshop is to share ideas, methods, techniques, and tools that 

help users model and detect vulnerabilities in software.   The 

workshop will try to bring together people from both academia and 

industry, from all the different areas that want to develop new 

techniques to model and detect vulnerabilities, to report their 

experience on using tools or methods to detect vulnerabilities.  

This workshop with try to answer the following questions:
? How vulnerability modelling can help user to understand 

the occurrence of vulnerabilities to avoid them?
? What are the advantages/drawbacks of the existing models 

to represent vulnerabilities? Are they satisfactory?  Otherwise, 

how they can be improved?
? What are the existing techniques to detect 

vulnerabilities? Are they satisfactory?  Otherwise, how they can 

be improved?
? How verification and testing techniques can help to detect 

and prevent vulnerabilities?
? How tools can help developers to detect vulnerabilities 

and improve the software quality?

--------------------------------------
Topics
--------------------------------------
The workshop addresses different techniques to model and detect 

vulnerabilities. The topics of interest include, but are not 

restricted to:

? Security requirements definition and modelling
? Security goals modelling
? Security and vulnerability modelling
? Formal approaches for vulnerability detection
? Testing and verification techniques for vulnerability 

detection
? Formal approaches for security validation
? Theorem proving for  vulnerability detection
? Good practises for security flaws avoidance
? Security related Tools (modelling, checking) 

--------------------------------------
Important dates:

--------------------------------------
Paper submission: 29 January 2010 (deadline extended)
Notification of acceptance: 1 March 2010
Final manuscript due: 21 March 2010
Workshop: 10 April 2010

--------------------------------------
Submission Guidelines  
-------------------------------------- 
Authors are invited to submit research and application papers in 

IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscripts style (two columns, 

single-spaced, including figures and references, using 10 pt 

fonts, and number each page). Please consult the IEEE CS Author 

Guidelines at the following web page:

http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting  

The workshop is open to contributions that focus on methods and 

tools to modelling and detecting vulnerabilities. Industrial 

experience report (success story and even failed ones), progress, 

new methods and solutions in that context are very encouraged. In 

all these cases, we expect well-focused contributions to help 

participants understand problems, open issues, and available 

solutions, and also to foster rich and fruitful discussions. 

Papers should try to be bold and visionary, but limited to 10 

pages. The emphasis should be on defining and setting problems, on 

technical details of proposed solutions, or on the rationale 

behind success stories. 

Contact author must provide the following information: paper 

title, authors' names, affiliations, postal address, phone, fax, 

and e-mail address of the author(s), about 200-250 word abstract, 

and about five keywords. 
 
Paper registration and submission is  by email attachment (Word 

format) to wissam.mallouli?replace with at-character?montimage.com 

in word or pdf format.

The MDV Workshop  will be held in the heart of Paris at Telecom 

ParisTech (http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/en/). This engineering 

school is situated in the south-eastern part of the French 

capital, the 13th district. It is in the middle of the picturesque 

district of Butte-aux-Cailles and will benefit from the dynamics 

of the economic, academic and socio-cultural activities of
left bank of the Seine River.
