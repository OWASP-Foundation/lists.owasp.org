WORKSHOP AIM

In recent years, the growing importance of functional correctness and the
increased relevance of system quality properties (e.g. performance,
reliability, security) have stimulated the emergence of analytical and
modelling techniques for the design and development of software systems.
With the increasing complexity of today's software systems, FESCA aims at
addressing two research questions: (1) what role the software architecture
can play in systematic addressing of the analytical and modelling
challenges, and (2) how formal and semi-formal techniques can be applied
effectively to make the issues easier to address automatically, with lower
human intervention.



TOPICS



We encourage submissions on (semi-)formal techniques and their application
that aid analysis, design and implementation of software applications,
including the techniques in the realm of Model-Driven Development.

In this context, the topics include (but are not limited to):

* Modelling

- Modelling formalisms;

- Models, metamodels and model transformations;

* Correctness checking

- Temporal properties and their formal verification;

- Interface compliance and contractual use of components;

* Correctness of models, metamodels and model transformations

* Analysis and prediction of quality attributes

- Formal prediction and analysis;

- Static and dynamic analysis;

- Instrumentation and monitoring approaches;

* Industrial case studies and experience reports.

We encourage not only mature research results, submissions presenting
innovative ideas and early results of junior researchers are also of a
particular interest.



SUBMISSIONS



Three kinds of submissions are solicited:



* regular papers (up to 15 pages) presenting original and unpublished work
related to the workshop topics,

* position papers (up to 10 pages) presenting ideas and directions of
interesting ongoing and yet unpublished research related to the workshop
topics, and

* tool demonstration papers (up to 8 pages) presenting and highlighting the
distinguishing features of a topic-related tool (co-developed by the
authors).



PROCEEDINGS



    *  Final versions of accepted regular, position and tool papers will be
published in a volume of the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer
Science (EPTCS). 



IMPORTANT DATES



    *    Paper registration: December 10, 2014

    *    Submission deadline: December 17, 2014

    *    Notification of acceptance: January 26, 2015

    *    Final versions due: February 16, 2015

    *    Workshop date:  April 12, 2015
