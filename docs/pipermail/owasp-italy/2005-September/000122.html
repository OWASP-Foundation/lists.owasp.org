The product has a lot of features, including:

SysCheck is a desktop application designed to load test functional behavior, 
measure performance and WebSite related, helpfull tools.

SiteCheck:

SiteCheck is a powerful utility which lets you check your WebServers and 
their services.

SiteSpeed*:

SiteSpeed is an easy-to-use tool that simulates Internet traffic and 
provides developers with precise real-time information on site performance.
In today&#146;s Internet environment, where speed is of the utmost importance, 
SiteSpeed delivers meaningful test results in just minutes.
It may be used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources 
(files or CGI, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java Objects).
The performance test start when you flag the &quot;Test performance&quot; checkbox 
option, if not you can have back the Header and the Page source of the Web 
Server.
The Overload Index coming out pushed by the green columns and cutted by the 
red, specifically the first green give one point, the second green give 1/2 
point and the third green give 1/3 of point, also the first red cut one 
point, the second red cut two points and finally the last red column leave 
three points.


SiteStress*:

With this you can finally know how many users can simultaney load your 
WebServer.
The &quot;Stress&quot; button start calling the URL page in a rolling close sequence.
Check the &quot;Get graphics&quot; to do the same thing of previous, but is more 
invasive because get all graphics of the page called.
The number of users is calculated by this expression User = one PageView 
every 10 seconds.

SiteCompare*:

Sometimes we need to know the page load performance.
You can compare two site and look the difference, use the clear cache option 
to have the exact time/load.
Be sure to use one test at time, when the first URL has finished, begin the 
other one, finally you can compare the average time.

*This tool operate good only with a direct connection to internet, bandwith 
is a factor that change the test results.
