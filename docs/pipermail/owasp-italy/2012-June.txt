Subject: [Owasp-italy] Intervento al RubyDay: Ruby per penetration tester
Message-ID: <CAFRi_CwpU-8wetpzgZGwbOHhmcqpCTPW2yLfmtnO+A33sT-18g@mail.gmail.com>

Ciao a tutti, vi volevo segnalare che lo scorso venerd? 15 Giugno ho
tenuto un talk dal titolo "Ruby for penetration tester" al RubyDay di
Milano, conferenza dedicata al linguaggio Ruby.

Prima volta per me come speaker di appsec in una conferenza di sviluppatori.
Con mia sorpresa ? stato il talk pi? votato per gradimento, segno che
gli sviluppatori hanno sentore del problema o quanto meno la tematica
interessa.

Backbone dello slideshow ? stata la Owasp Testing Guide, usata per
individuare i test pi? interessanti da implementare con codice ruby.

Le slide sono disponibili qui:
https://speakerdeck.com/u/thesp0nge/p/ruby-for-penetration-tester
Sarebbe bello iniziare a parlare a quante pi? conf di sviluppatori
possibili per passare info di application security a chi poi deve
mettere nero su bianco del codice.

Ciaps
Paolo
