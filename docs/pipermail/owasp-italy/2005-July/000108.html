FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

OWASP Offers Free Web Application Security Book and Announces Membership
Plan

July 26, 2005 (Washington D.C.)

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has released a free
open-source web application security book, &quot;The OWASP Guide to Securing Web
Applications and Services 2.0.&quot; Software developers, project managers, and
security professionals need this information to produce secure web
applications.

After three years of community development, this is a major new release,
with detailed coverage of secure software design, performing security
reviews, handling credit cards, defeating phishing, securing web services,
and much more. The book is platform independent and includes examples in
Java, .NET, and PHP. All of the materials at OWASP are free and open-source.
The 277 page book can be downloaded in both PDF and Word formats from the
OWASP website at <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org.">http://www.owasp.org.</A>

OWASP also announced a membership program. &quot;We strongly encourage
organizations using our materials to support us financially by becoming an
OWASP Member&quot;, says OWASP Chair Jeff Williams. &quot;OWASP is a fantastic source
of unbiased application security information. We need your support to
continue producing great materials like the Guide.&quot;

OWASP is a 501c3 not-for-profit foundation dedicated to finding and fighting
the causes of insecure software. Our materials are the defacto standard for
application security worldwide and used in broad range of industries. OWASP
has dozens of projects, over 50 chapters around the world, thousands of
participants, and millions of hits every month. For further information, see
our website at <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org.">http://www.owasp.org.</A>
