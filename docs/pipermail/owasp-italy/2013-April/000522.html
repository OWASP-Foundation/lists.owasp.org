PhD Scholarship Available

Software Engineering (SE) research unit
Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy

The Software Engineering (SE) research unit (<A HREF="http://se.fbk.eu">http://se.fbk.eu</A>), part of 
the Center for Information Technology (CIT) of the Bruno Kessler 
Foundation in Trento, Italy (<A HREF="http://cit.fbk.eu/">http://cit.fbk.eu/</A>), is seeking prospective 
PhD students interested in undertaking their PhD research in the 
following area.

Security testing of mobile applications

In order to win the race against competitors, mobile applications for 
tablets and smart-phones are often developed with fast time-to-market 
approach. For this reason, development effort is often committed to 
deliver novel and engaging features and less attention is devoted in 
reviewing the quality of the code. As a result applications are released 
that still contain defects, faults and potential security problem.

Novel approaches need to be elaborated to automate the testing phase of 
mobile applications, with a particular attention to security aspects, as 
a fundamental support to ensure both high quality and fast development 
model. This includes the elaboration of novel techniques for 
identification of potential security defects, for automatic test case 
generation and for developing an oracle to assess whether the system 
under analysis passes all the brand new test cases.

The research activities will take place at FBK-SE (<A HREF="http://se.fbk.eu/">http://se.fbk.eu/</A>), 
the Software Engineering
research unit within Fondazione Bruno Kessler.

Selected candidates, if not already enrolled in a PhD Program, will be 
invited to apply for
PhD position at a national PhD School.

HOW TO APPLY:

Interested candidates should apply by sending email to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-italy">ceccato at fbk.eu</A> 
with a Curriculum Vitae. (PDF format is strongly encouraged). Emails 
should have 'SE/phd' as subject.

THE DEADLINE FOR THE APPLICATION: April 10, 2013.
