===============
The 5th European Conference on Computer Network Defence will take
place in November 2009 at the Politecnico di Milano technical
university in Milano, Italy.

The theme of the conference is the protection of computer
networks. The conference will draw participants from academia and
industry in Europe and beyond to discuss hot topics in applied network
and systems security.

EC2ND invites submissions presenting novel ideas at an early stage
with the intention to act as a discussion forum and feedback channel
for promising, innovative security research. While our goal is to
solicit ideas that are not completely worked out, and might have
challenging and interesting open questions, we expect submissions to
be supported by some evidence of feasibility or preliminary
quantitative results.

Topics include but are not limited to:

      * Intrusion Detection
      * Denial-of-Service
      * Privacy Protection
      * Security Policy
      * Peer-to-Peer and Grid Security
      * Network Monitoring
      * Web Security
      * Vulnerability Management and Tracking
      * Network Forensics
      * Wireless and Mobile Security
      * Cryptography
      * Network Discovery and Mapping
      * Incident Response and Management
      * Malicious Software
      * Web Services Security
      * Legal and Ethical Issues

The conference will be technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer
Society - Italy Chapter.

==================
Submitting a Paper
==================
You are hereby invited to submit papers up to 6-8 pages, 8.5" x 11",
two-column format. We particularly encourage position papers on
preliminary work that shows promise, rather than mature and
well-polished papers. Surprising results and thought-provoking ideas
will be strongly favored. All submissions will be reviewed by the
Program Committee. Authors of accepted papers will be given the option
of including their paper in the proceedings of the conference.

We suggest you to format your paper according to IEEE-CS guidelines:
http://www.computer.org/portal/pages/cscps/cps/cps_forms.html

First Iberic Conference on Web-Applications Security (IBWAS?09)

Escuela Universitaria de Ingenier?a T?cnica de Telecomunicac?on -
Universidad Polit?cnica de Madrid

10th ? 11th December 2009

Madrid, Spain

Announce and Call for Papers

Introduction

------------

There is a change in the information systems development paradigm. The
emergence of Web 2.0 technologies led to the extensive deployment and
use of web-based applications and web services as a way to developed
new and flexible information systems. Such systems are easy to
develop, deploy and maintain and demonstrate impressive features for
users, resulting in their current wide use.

As a result of this paradigm shift, the security requirements have
also changed. These web-based information systems have different
security requirements, when compared to traditional systems. Important
security issues have been found and privacy concerns have also been
raised recently. In addition, the emerging Cloud Computing paradigm
promises even greater flexibility; however corresponding security and
privacy issues still need to be examined. The security environment
should involve not only the surrounding environment but also the
application core.

This conference aims to bring together application security experts,
researchers, educators and practitioners from the industry, academia
and international communities such as OWASP, in order to discuss open
problems and new solutions in application security. In the context of
this track academic researchers will be able to combine interesting
results with the experience of practitioners and software engineers.

Keynote Speakers

----------------

* Bruce Schneier, acclaimed security guru, author, BT CSTO (confirmed)

* Inspector Jorge Mart?n, High Tech Crime Unit of the Spanish National Police

Conference Topics

-----------------

Suggested topics for papers submission include (but are not limited to):

? Secure application development

? Security of service oriented architectures

? Security of development frameworks

? Threat modelling of web applications

? Cloud computing security

? Web applications vulnerabilities and analysis (code review,
pen-test, static analysis etc.)

? Metrics for application security

? Countermeasures for web application vulnerabilities

? Secure coding techniques

? Platform or language security features that help secure web applications

? Secure database usage in web applications

? Access control in web applications

? Web services security

? Browser security

? Privacy in web applications

? Standards, certifications and security evaluation criteria for web
applications

? Application security awareness and education

? Security for the mobile web

? Attacks and Vulnerability Exploitation

Paper Submission Instructions

-----------------------------

Authors should submit an original paper in English, carefully checked
for correct grammar and spelling, using the on-line submission
procedure (http://paperman.ibwas.com). Please check the paper formats
so you may be aware of the accepted paper page limits (8 pages, in
accordance to a supplied template).

The guidelines for paper formatting provided at the conference web
site must be strictly used for all submitted papers. The submission
format is the same as the camera-ready format. Please check and
carefully follow the instructions and templates provided.

Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its
technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or
environments to which it is applicable.

Papers that are out of the conference scope or contain any form of
plagiarism will be rejected without reviews.

Remarks about the on-line submission procedure:

1. A "double-blind" paper evaluation method will be used. To
facilitate that, the authors are kindly requested to produce and
provide the paper, WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors. This
means that is necessary to remove the author?s personal details, the
acknowledgements section and any reference that may disclose the
authors identity

2. Papers in ODF, PDF, DOC, DOCX or RTF format are accepted

3. The web submission procedure automatically sends an
acknowledgement, by e-mail, to the contact author.

Paper submission types

----------------------

Regular Paper Submission

A regular paper presents a work where the research is completed or
almost finished. It does not necessary means that the acceptance is as
a full paper. It may be accepted as a "full paper" (30 min. oral
presentation), a "short paper" (15 min. oral presentation) or a
"poster".

Position Paper Submission

A position paper presents an arguable opinion about an issue. The goal
of a position paper is to convince the audience that your opinion is
valid and worth listening to, without the need to present completed
research work and/or validated results. It is, nevertheless, important
to support your argument with evidence to ensure the validity of your
claims. A position paper may be a short report and discussion of
ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific
research (bibliographic, experimental, theoretical, or other) focused
on one of the conference topic areas. The acceptance of a position
paper is restricted to the categories of "short paper" or "poster",
i.e. a position paper is not a candidate to acceptance as "full
paper".

Camera-ready

After the reviewing process is completed, the contact author (the
author who submits the paper) of each paper will be notified of the
result, by e-mail. The authors are required to follow the reviews in
order to improve their paper before the camera-ready submission.

Publications

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings,
under an ISBN reference, in paper and in CD-ROM support.

Important Dates

Submission of papers due: 30th September 2009
