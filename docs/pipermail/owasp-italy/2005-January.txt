Subject: [Owasp-italy] OWASP AppSec 2005 Europe Apr 9-10
Message-ID: <d2d9d92d05012410163216459e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is proud to announce its second Application Security Conference
to be held April 9-10 near London. The OWASP AppSec Europe 2005
Conference is just a short 3 months away and since there's limited
seating, be sure to register early to reserve your seat and support
the not-for-profit OWASP Foundation. Check out the OWASP website at
http://www.owasp.org/conferences.html for all the emerging details.

You'll hear great speakers like:

 - Denis Verdon (Head of CISG, Fidelity National Financial)
 - Dr. Charles Pfleeger (Author of Security in Computing)
 - Jeff Williams (OWASP Chair and CEO, Aspect Security)
 - Dinis Cruz (Leader of the OWASP .NET project)
 - Rogan Dawes (Author of WebScarab)
 - Ivan Ristic (Author of ModSecurity)
 - David Raphael (Java and .NET Security)
 - Arian Evans (Session Management and Testing Tools)

AppSec Europe 2005 is April 9-10 at Royal Holloway, University of
London -- home of one of the best InfoSec programs in Europe and
featured in the Da Vinci Code. OWASP's AppSec conferences are
dedicated to real-world application security issues and solutions.
You'll learn all aspects of application security, including people,
process, and technology perspectives.

You'll hear presentations on topics like:

  - OWASP Status, Direction, and new Projects
  - Web Application Testing Tools and Techniques
  - Code Reviews
  - Application Security in Large Organizations
  - .NET, Java, and LAMP Security
  - Web Application Intrusion Detection
  - Software Security Metrics
  - Lessons Learned in the Trenches

There will also be panel discussions on the important issues led by
corporate application security practitioners. We will post a full
agenda as soon as it is finalized. By participating you'll have a
direct opportunity to help shape and influence the direction of OWASP
in 2005.

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a not-for-profit we have been able to keep
the cost to ?150 (or $280) per seat which is significantly less than
what most conferences cost.

You can register for the conference using PayPal (preferred) using the
following email address conference-nyc at owasp.org.  We also have a
direct link to Paypal via the OWASP Website at www.owasp.org. 
Alternatively, you can register by sending a check in USD made payable
to the OWASP Foundation:

  OWASP AppSec Europe 2005
  The OWASP Foundation
  9175 Guilford Road, Suite 300
  Columbia, MD 21046-2565

PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL TICKETS ARE NON REFUNDABLE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATION COSTS

If you know others that would be interested in attending OWASP AppSec
Europe 2005, please forward them this email and let them know about
this opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions,

--Jeff

Jeff Williams, Chair
The OWASP Foundation
