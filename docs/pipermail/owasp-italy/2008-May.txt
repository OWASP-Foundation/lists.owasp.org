The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has awarded 31

free and open source for everyone.

Currently, having the project's selection period closed, we are
pleased to announce that 31 projects have been selected which
represent an investment of 104,000 U.S. dollars. Projects were
selected for innovation in application security and ability to deliver
high quality results before September 15, 2008.

OWASP is an all-volunteer organization, so 100% of OWASP membership
fees are used to sponsor innovative research projects. This is the
third "season of code" sponsored by OWASP. Details of all the projects

?         The OWASP AntiSamy Rich Content Security library (free library)
?         The OWASP CSRFGuard and CSRFTester tools (free tools)
?         And many many more?

Projects selected for the Summer of Code 2008 include new books and
innovative tools to help developers, architects, and security
specialists ensure that applications are secure.

OWASP invites individuals and companies that benefit from OWASP
