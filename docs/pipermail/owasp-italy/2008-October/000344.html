<PRE>PRESS RELEASE: OWASP European Summit - Portugal
Portugal/Algarve - 4th - 7th November 2008

Setting the Web Application Security Agenda for 2009: OWASP Invites
You to Join Our Summit in Portugal

<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008</A>

With the theme 'Setting the AppSec agenda for 2009', the OWASP Summit
will be a worldwide gathering of OWASP leaders and key industry
players to present and discuss the latest OWASP tools, documentation
projects, and web application security trends. Join us in Portugal in
just a few short weeks! This venue hosts a diverse selection of
training courses along with technical and business tracks, making it
THE place to learn about web application security and the resources
OWASP has available for use today.

OWASP is a not-for-profit organization with the purpose of supporting
the Web Application Security community around the world, and has
granted $250,000 USD for web application security research. In
addition to over 40 presentations from the OWASP Leaders and grant
recipients, the OWASP Summit will host multiple Working Sessions
designed to improve collaboration, achieve specific objectives and
identify roadmaps for OWASP projects, chapters, and the OWASP
community itself.

To facilitate this event, OWASP is investing $150,000 USD which will
be used to cover air travel and accommodation expenses for OWASP
leaders, active contributors, and select key industry leaders. With
their confirmed presence, the OWASP Summit will provide a relaxed but
professional environment to meet, discuss, influence and contribute to
OWASP projects.
