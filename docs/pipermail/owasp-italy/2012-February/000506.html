Call for Participation

- FESCA 2012 -

9th International Workshop on
Formal Engineering approaches to Software Components and Architectures

Satellite event of ETAPS
March 31st 2012, Tallinn, Estonia

<A HREF="http://fesca.ipd.kit.edu/fesca2012/">http://fesca.ipd.kit.edu/fesca2012/</A>

WORKSHOP AIM

Component-based software design has received considerable attention in 
industry and academia in the past decade. In recent years, the growing 
need for trustworthy software systems and the increased relevance of 
systems quality properties (e.g. reliability, performance, and 
scalability) have stimulated the emergence of formal techniques and 
architecture modelling approaches for the specification and 
implementation of component-based software architectures. Both have to 
deal with an increasing complexity in software systems challenging 
analytical methods as well as modelling techniques.

FESCA aims to address the open question of how formal methods can be 
applied effectively to these new contexts and challenges. FESCA is 
interested in both the development and application of formal methods in 
component-based development and tries to cross-fertilize their research 
and application.

PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS

* SAMUEL KOUNEV, chair of SPEC Research Group (RG) and  Descartes RG at 
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany), has agreed to deliver the 
FESCA 2012 keynote speech on the topic: &quot;Modeling of Event-based 
Communication in Component-based Architectures:State-of-the-Art and 
Future Directions&quot;

* MICHAL MALOHLAVA, has agreed to give tutorial on: &quot;SOFA 2 Component 
Framework and Its Ecosystem&quot;


TOPICS

One strength of FESCA is the link established between the formal methods 
community and the software engineering community by exploring how formal 
approaches can be exploited for the analysis of large software 
architectures.

We encourage submissions on formal techniques and their application that 
aid reasoning, analysis and certification of component-based 
applications. In this context, the following topics are of particular 
concern:

    *   Architecture as a language: Building Domain-Specific Languages
      (DSLs)
          o Modelling formalisms for the analysis of concurrent, embeded
            or model-driven systems assembled of components;
          o Modelling formalisms in prediction, analysis and measurement
            of software quality attributes such as reliability,
            performance, or security;
    * Properties of component-based models
          o Temporal properties (including liveness and safety) and
            their formal verification;
          o Interface compliance (interface-to-interface and
            interface-to implementation) and contractual use of components;
    * Formal methods in Component-Based Software Development
          o Techniques for prediction and formal verification of system
            properties, including static and dynamic analysis;
          o Instrumentation and monitoring approaches, runtime
            management of applications;
          o (Semi-) automatic inference of analytical models for
            existing software systems;
    * Formal methods in Model-Driven Software Development
          o Abstraction level in modelling formalisms;
          o Safer MDA through integration with formal methods;
          o Correctness of model transformations;
    * Industrial case studies and experience reports.


Submissions concentrating on specification techniques should involve an 
evaluation of the practical merit of their research and clearly state 
the analysis and reasoning techniques they enable. We also appreciate 
work of a formal nature with immediate value to the industrial context. 
We encourage not only mature research results, submissions presenting 
innovative ideas and early results are also of interest.


SUBMISSIONS

Three kinds of submissions are considered:

    * Regular papers (up to 15 pages in ENTCS format), presenting
      original and unpublished work related to the workshop topics.

    * Position papers (up to 10 pages in ENTCS format) presenting ideas
      and directions of interesting ongoing and yet unpublished research
      related to the workshop topics.

    * Tool demonstration papers (up to 5 pages in ENTCS format),
      presenting and highlighting the distinguishing features of a
      topic-related tool (co-developed by the authors).


PROCEEDINGS

    *   Regular and position papers will be published in a special issue
      of the Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS)
      after the workshop.

    * All regular, position and tool demonstration papers will appear in
      electronic pre-proceedings distributed at the workshop.



IMPORTANT DATES

    *     Paper registration: December 2, 2011
    *     Submission deadline: December 9, 2011
    *     Notification of acceptance: January 20, 2012
    *     Final versions due: February 3, 2012
    *     Workshop date:  March 31, 2012
