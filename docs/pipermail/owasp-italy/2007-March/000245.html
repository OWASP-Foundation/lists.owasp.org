15-17 2007 - Milan, Italy

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is proud to announce its 6th Application Security Conference to
be held May 15-17 at the Marriott in Milan, Italy. Please reserve
these dates!! This facility looks to be the nicest facility we have
had the opportunity to use yet for our European conferences.

This conference will include:

- Training (On May 15th) Three 1-day application security courses are
being offered the day prior to the conference

- Main Conference (May 16-17) This year's conference will include
daily keynotes, presentations, refereed papers, lots of OWASP
projects, and two panels to encourage discussion amongst the
attendees.

- Evening Social Event (May 16) &#8211; We are planning a social event as we
do each conference which facilitates the attendees ability to mingle
and get to know each other better.

Current details on the conference are available on the OWASP website at
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/6th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_Italy_2007">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/6th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_Italy_2007</A>
This conference is expected to be kicked off with a keynote by a
representative from Microsoft on &quot;The Benefits of the SDL initiative
to Microsoft and its Customers&quot;. This should be similar to the
presentation that Mike Howard gave to kick off the 5th OWASP AppSec
Conference which was the highlight of that conference (in my opinion).
It discusses the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) and
the benefits Microsoft and its customers have gained by developing and
adopting it.

OWASP's AppSec conferences are dedicated to real-world application
security issues and solutions. You'll learn many aspects of
application security, including people, process, and technology
perspectives.

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a non-profit charitable organization, OWASP
has been able to keep the cost to 450 Euro's per seat. For OWASP
Members it's only 400 Euros. These prices are further reduced by 50
Euros for early registration prior to April 16th.

Note: Payment for the conference will actually have to be in US
dollars as OWASP currently has no mechanism for accepting Euro's for
payment with our current registration system.

Registration is available at:
<A HREF="http://guest.cvent.com/EVENTS/Register/IdentityConfirmation.aspx?e=4abc935c-a7f8-47e1-83a0-23a2c36faf26">http://guest.cvent.com/EVENTS/Register/IdentityConfirmation.aspx?e=4abc935c-a7f8-47e1-83a0-23a2c36faf26</A>

PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATION COSTS

TRAINING COURSES (May 15):

These classes will be held at the Marriott. Each class is 650 Euros
for conference attendees (and includes lunch).

  - FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY

  - WEB SERVICES AND XML SECURITY

  - ADVANCED .NET SECURITY


More details on these training courses are available at:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/6th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_Italy_2007/Training">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/6th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_Italy_2007/Training</A>


EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - May 16th - An optional dinner event.
This event involves a dinner at a nearby restaurant from 7-9 PM,
followed by drinks at local watering holes. We hope to see all of you
there as this is a great chance to mingle and meet many members of the
OWASP community.

ACCOMMODATIONS: Information about local accommodations, including
reduced rate rooms is available at:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/6th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_Italy_2007#Accomodations">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/6th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_Italy_2007#Accomodations</A>

If you know others that would be interested in attending the 6th OWASP
AppSec Conference, please forward them this email and let them know
about this opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you all there!

Thanks, Dave
