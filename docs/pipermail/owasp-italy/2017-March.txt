17:15-18:00 - Sala ASIA C - Seminario a cura del capitolo italiano di OWASP

Sono previsti due interventi.

EyePyramid e altri malware .NET. Come analizzarli?

Una considerevole parte di malware RAT (Remote Access Trojan) sono
scritti in linguaggio .NET, come ad esempio il recentemente scoperto
EyePyramid. E' comune pensare che la loro analisi sia facile grazie
all'utilizzo di decompilatori, ma la realta' e' ben diversa. In questa
presentazione vedremo quali sono le difficolta' e in che modo analizzare
dei casi reali di malware scritti in .NET e offuscati con tecniche
avanzate. La presentazione e' rivolta sia ad analisti di sicurezza che a
sviluppatori che necessitano di proteggere il codice dei propri programmi.
