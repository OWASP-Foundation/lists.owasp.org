 CALL FOR PAPERS

 MeSSa 2010
 1st International Workshop on
 Measurability of Security in Software Architectures

 http://www.vtt.fi/sites/messa2010/

  Copenhagen, Denmark, August 23, 2010

 Co-located with
 The 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA
2010)

=============================================================
TOPICS

The growing complexity of service-centric systems has increased the need for 
pertinent and reliable software security and trusted system solutions. Systematic 
approaches to measuring security in software architectures are needed in order to 
obtain sufficient and credible proactive evidence of the security level or performance 
of a system, service or product. The systematic definition of security metrics and 
security assurance metrics is a young field that still lacks widely accepted definitions 
of metrics and applicable measuring techniques for design-time and run-time security 
monitoring.

The workshop will provide a forum for dissemination, demonstration and discussion 
of original scientific and experimental results of security measurement topics.

MeSSa 2010 solicits contributions on the following issues (but not limited to):
* Security, trust and privacy metrics
* Security assurance metrics
* Security, trust and privacy measurement systems and associated data gathering
* Metrics for adaptive security systems
* Taxonomical and ontological research on security metrics
* Experimental results from security measurements
* Security measurability-increasing mechanisms for software architectures
* The relationship and differences between security metrics and security  assurance 
metrics
* Tradeoff analysis and decision-making at design-time and at run- time


PUBLICATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS

The workshop paper will be published in a second volume of the ECSA 2010 
conference proceedings with an ISBN number and through ACM digital library 
(approval pending). At least one author of all accepted papers must present the paper 
at the workshop.


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission of papers: May 17, 2010
Author notification: June 7, 2010
Submission of camera-ready paper: July 1, 2010


SUBMISSION

Authors should submit a workshop paper no longer than eight pages. A double-blind 
review process will be carried out to all submitted regular papers. 

The authors should use the ACM template for the paper. The first page of the 
submitted paper should contain the paper title, author names, affiliations and contact 
information (this page is not counted to the total number of pages). The second page 
should start with paper title, without author information. The paper should be 
supplied in MS Word or PDF format to messa2010 at vtt.fi.

ORGANISING PROJECTS

GEMOM (Genetic Message Oriented Secure Middleware) is an EU FP7 ICT 
project (2008-2010) that focuses on significant and measurable 
increases in the end-to-end intelligence, security and resilience of 
complex distributed information systems. The GEMOM project has 
prototyped a security monitoring system that utilises security 
metrics and has developed novel approaches for security metrics 
development. The prototypes are currently being validated in five 
case studies - a collaborative business portal, a dynamic linked 
exchange, a financial market data delivery system, a dynamic road 
management system and a banking scenario.

BUGYO Beyond (Building Security Assurance in Open Infrastructures, 
Beyond) is a CELTIC Eureka project (2008-2011) that focuses on 
extending the security assurance metrics work performed in the BUGYO 
CELTIC project. Its aims are: (i) to cover areas such as self-
developed metrics, patterns of metrics and modelling support, (ii) 
to provide means for comparing and exchanging assurance information 
between different operators, including the normalisation and 
standardisation of assurance measures and aggregated levels, and 
(iii) to cope with dynamics and mobility by addressing issues that 
emerge from evolving and ubiquitous infrastructure.

SOFIA (Smart Objects For Intelligent Applications) is an ARTEMIS 
project (2009-2011) that focuses on the information interoperability 
of physical spaces and the ontology-driven development of smart 
space applications. One of the key drivers in the development of 
smart spaces and smart space applications is information security 
and its run-time management in changing situations. The first 
prototyped solutions of the run-time security management suggest 
that a common and widely accepted security metrics ontology could be 
developed as a joint effort between European research projects. 

The above-mentioned projects will offer demonstrations of security 
measurements in the workshop.
