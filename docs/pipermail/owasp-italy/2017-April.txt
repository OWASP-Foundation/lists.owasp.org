We're now less than 2 months way from AppSec Europe

    hacking contactless payments, GDPR, quantum safe crypto, securing
    Azure Cloud, Oauth2, bypassing XSS controls, pentesting voice
    biometrics and even printer security! 
  *  In addition to that we'll have panels on diversity and hacking
    elections, along with interactive sessions allowing everyone to get
    out their laptop and hack a few websites.
  * While this year's tracks are aimed at developers, ethical hackers,
    CSIOs and devsecops, we will also have 'Hallway Tracks' allowing
    anyone to setup their own talk or discussion session, as well as
    HackPra AllStars

    include Mario Heiderich on exploiting websites, Robert Seacord on
    secure Java, mobile, python, machine learning, IoT and SSO

    conference dinner taking place in the Titanic Suite of the Titanic
    Visitor Center, voted the best worldwide tourist attraction in 2016,
    including drinks, music and a bit of unique entertainment.
    This venue looks out onto the Game of Thrones studios here in Belfast.
  *  In addition there'll be a Pre-Conference drinks event on the
    Wednesday night, allowing everyone to settle in and mingle at the
    conference venue.


*The Usual*

Ciao ragazzi, ho creato un progetto per la traduzione della Top 10:
https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/projects/1
E' un placeholder perch? visti i numerosi topic che stanno partendo sulla
RC1, ho deciso di aspettare la RC2 a Giugno.
Useremo il kanban per tracciare le attivit?, un po' come l'excel di qualche
anno fa.

Quando uscir? la RC2, mander? un nuovo messaggio in lista, intanto via via
creer? i vari task.
Serviranno as usual, traduttori e revisori.

Hi Dave, hi Sebastien. I'll wait RC2 so to catch up all the debate in
various thread.

I'll use Github repository project feature to manage the Italian
translation progress.

Ciao
