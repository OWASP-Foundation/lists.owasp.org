Buongiorno a tutti,
l'IDC European Banking Forum del 18 Novembre scorso ? stato un
successo per OWASP.
Ho trovato molto interesse per l'iniziativa.
Vi inoltro il link per condividere con voi la presentazione:

Rimane aperto il discorso dell'organizzazione dei meeting, che magari
riprenderemo a breve.

A presto,

Hi fellow chapter leaders.

The mail below are the poll results of a mail I send last week to our
Belgian chapter members.
Maybe an idea for your chapter as well?

Kind regards,

Sebastien

Hi,

Thank you for your responses!

Attached you will find the results and first analysis of the poll of last week.

My findings are:
1) 19% of the subscribed members answered within 2 days. Which I think
is a good result.
After New York, New Jersey, Seattle, Italy we are the 5th biggest
chapter in the world and 2nd biggest chapter outside the US after
Italy (87 members).

2) We have a nice mix of novice and experts.
This supports a dual track approach for the chapter meetings: an
introduction part and a session with advanced content.

3) Suggests that we should indeed be aiming for at least 3, maybe 4
sessions a year.

4) 5 people were considering to give a presentations. This looks
promising; we should succeed in organizing chapter sessions with at
least one chapter member preparing a topic. We could additionally
invite external speakers as well.

I am looking forward to your opinion on the above results.

I would also propose to start next year with an informal New Years
Drink in January:
Thursday evening 19th of January ok for everybody?
Are there suggestions, or sponsors :-), for a venue?

Best wishes for you and your family in 2006 !

Kind regards,

Seba

To all the OWASP participants worldwide,

 

 As 2005 comes to an end I want thank you all for making OWASP a success!
With a growing membership and skyrocketing downloads we are making a real
difference in finding and fighting the causes of application security
vulnerabilities.

 

Through your hard work in 2005, OWASP has released a completely overhauled
Guide, powerful new features in WebScarab, and hosted two successful AppSec
conferences. Our downloads have more than doubled to over 16,000 every
month, our unique visitors have doubled to almost 35,000 every month, and
our bandwidth requirements have soared 600% to over 18GB per month.

 

Our New Jersey chapter has arranged for a Holiday discount for OWASP
participants.  From now through December 31st, get 30% off any books you
order through http://www.oreilly.com/buy. Just use Discount Code HOHOHO when
you place your order.

 

Have a wonderful Holiday season and best wishes for the New Year.

 

--Jeff

Ho visto che alcuni di voi hanno interpretato l'ultima domanda
indicando quale sia la vulnerabilit? pi? riscontrata delle 10
elencate.
La mia idea era invece quella di pensare per ciascuna delle 10
vulnerabilit?, la % delle applicazioni testate che soffrono di tale
problematica.
Cos? ad esempio se ho testato 10 applicazioni:
Input Validation: 80% (ovvero su 10 testate, 8 erano vulnerabili
all'Input Validation).

Che ne pensate? Scusate per la poca chiarezza...

Subject: New OWASP project - PCI Web Security Standards
To: webappsec at securityfocus.com


Hello list,

I'm pleased to announce the start of a new OWASP project focused on
creating a proposed set of Web-application Security Standards for
sites that process credit card information.

As things currently stand, the payment card industry (PCI - Visa,
Mastercard, etc) plan to specify compliance to the OWASP Top Ten as
part of successfully passing a scan/audit.  Although the Top Ten lists
the common threats to web applications, it is neither comprehensive
nor testable in a pass/fail methodology.

The OWAS PCI-WASS project aims at producing a set of *minimum*
standards a web-application should be tested against if it is to
process credit card information.  A final goal is to arrive at a set
of testable criteria, much the same as the existing PCI security
standard.

If this interests you, please visit the project home page at
http://www.owasp.org/standards/pci-wass.html.  There you will find a
strawman document (available at
http://www.owasp.org/docroot/owasp/misc/PCI-WASS_Strawman_Draft.doc)
to start discussions and set direction.  To marshal comments, ideas,
discussions, criticism, and feedback, I have set up another list at
owasp-standards at lists.sourceforge.net

I look forward to your participation.

Cheers,
Mike.
