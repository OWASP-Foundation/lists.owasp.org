WORKSHOP AIM
In recent years, the growing importance of functional correctness and
the increased relevance of system quality properties (e.g.
performance, reliability, security) have stimulated the emergence of
analytical and modelling techniques for the design and development of
software systems. With the increasing complexity of today's software
systems, FESCA aims at addressing two research questions: (1) what
role the software architecture can play in systematic addressing of
the analytical and modelling challenges, and (2) how formal and
semi-formal techniques can be applied effectively to make the issues
easier to address automatically, with lower human intervention.

**************************************************************************
PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS: We are pleased to announce invited speaker and
tutorial:

Dr. Steffen Zschaler, from Software Modelling and Applied Logic Group,
Department of Informatics at King's College London (UK), has agreed to
deliver the FESCA 2015 keynote speech on the topic:
&quot;Building flexible analysis: Modular formal specification of QoS and
QoS analysis&quot;

and Michael Langhammer, from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,
has agreed to deliver tutorial on the topic:
&quot;Co-Evolution of Component-based Architecture and Code using Vitruvius&quot;


**************************************************************************

TOPICS

We encourage submissions on (semi-)formal techniques and their
application that aid analysis, design and implementation of software
applications, including the techniques in the realm of Model-Driven
Development.
In this context, the topics include (but are not limited to):
	* Modelling
		- Modelling formalisms;
		- Models, metamodels and model transformations;
	* Correctness checking
		- Temporal properties and their formal verification;
		- Interface compliance and contractual use of components;
	* Correctness of models, metamodels and model transformations
	* Analysis and prediction of quality attributes
		- Formal prediction and analysis;
		- Static and dynamic analysis;
		- Instrumentation and monitoring approaches;
	* Industrial case studies and experience reports.

We encourage not only mature research results, submissions presenting
innovative ideas and early results of junior researchers are also of a
particular interest.

SUBMISSIONS

Three kinds of submissions are solicited:

	* regular papers (up to 15 pages) presenting original and unpublished
work related to the workshop topics,
	* position papers (up to 10 pages) presenting ideas and directions of
interesting ongoing and yet unpublished research related to the
workshop topics, and
	* tool demonstration papers (up to 8 pages) presenting and
highlighting the distinguishing features of a topic-related tool
(co-developed by the authors).

PROCEEDINGS

     *  Final versions of accepted regular, position and tool papers
will be published in a volume of the Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).

IMPORTANT DATES

     *    Paper registration: December 17, 2014
     *    Submission deadline: December 21, 2014
     *    Notification of acceptance: January 26, 2015
     *    Final versions due: February 16, 2015
     *    Workshop date:  April 12, 2015
