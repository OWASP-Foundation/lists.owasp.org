Hi Domenico,

Thanks for the dissemination! Can you think about maybe some Italian distri=
bution lists on security topics?

 CALL FOR PAPERS

 MeSSa 2010
 1st International Workshop on
 Measurability of Security in Software Architectures

 http://www.vtt.fi/sites/messa2010/

  Copenhagen, Denmark, August 23, 2010

 Co-located with
 The 4th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA

TOPICS

The growing complexity of service-centric systems has increased the need fo=
r pertinent and reliable software security and trusted system solutions. Sy=
stematic approaches to measuring security in software architectures are nee=
ded in order to obtain sufficient and credible proactive evidence of the se=
curity level or performance of a system, service or product. The systematic=
 definition of security metrics and security assurance metrics is a young f=
ield that still lacks widely accepted definitions of metrics and applicable=
 measuring techniques for design-time and run-time security monitoring.

The workshop will provide a forum for dissemination, demonstration and disc=
ussion of original scientific and experimental results of security measurem=
ent topics.

MeSSa 2010 solicits contributions on the following issues (but not limited =
to):
* Security, trust and privacy metrics
* Security assurance metrics
* Security, trust and privacy measurement systems and associated data gathe=
ring
* Metrics for adaptive security systems
* Taxonomical and ontological research on security metrics
* Experimental results from security measurements
* Security measurability-increasing mechanisms for software architectures
* The relationship and differences between security metrics and security  a=
ssurance metrics
* Tradeoff analysis and decision-making at design-time and at run- time


PUBLICATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS

The workshop paper will be published in a second volume of the ECSA 2010 co=
nference proceedings with an ISBN number and through ACM digital library (a=
pproval pending). At least one author of all accepted papers must present t=
he paper at the workshop.


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission of papers: May 17, 2010
Author notification: June 7, 2010
Submission of camera-ready paper: July 1, 2010


SUBMISSION

Authors should submit a workshop paper no longer than eight pages. A double=
-blind review process will be carried out to all submitted regular papers.=
=20

The authors should use the ACM template for the paper. The first page of th=
e submitted paper should contain the paper title, author names, affiliation=
s and contact information (this page is not counted to the total number of =
pages). The second page should start with paper title, without author infor=
mation. The paper should be supplied in MS Word or PDF format to messa2010@=
vtt.fi.

ORGANISING PROJECTS

GEMOM (Genetic Message Oriented Secure Middleware) is an EU FP7 ICT=20
project (2008-2010) that focuses on significant and measurable=20
increases in the end-to-end intelligence, security and resilience of=20
complex distributed information systems. The GEMOM project has=20
prototyped a security monitoring system that utilises security=20
metrics and has developed novel approaches for security metrics=20
development. The prototypes are currently being validated in five=20
case studies - a collaborative business portal, a dynamic linked=20
exchange, a financial market data delivery system, a dynamic road=20
management system and a banking scenario.

BUGYO Beyond (Building Security Assurance in Open Infrastructures,=20
Beyond) is a CELTIC Eureka project (2008-2011) that focuses on=20
extending the security assurance metrics work performed in the BUGYO=20
CELTIC project. Its aims are: (i) to cover areas such as self-
developed metrics, patterns of metrics and modelling support, (ii)=20
to provide means for comparing and exchanging assurance information=20
between different operators, including the normalisation and=20
standardisation of assurance measures and aggregated levels, and=20
(iii) to cope with dynamics and mobility by addressing issues that=20
emerge from evolving and ubiquitous infrastructure.

SOFIA (Smart Objects For Intelligent Applications) is an ARTEMIS=20
project (2009-2011) that focuses on the information interoperability=20
of physical spaces and the ontology-driven development of smart=20
space applications. One of the key drivers in the development of=20
smart spaces and smart space applications is information security=20
and its run-time management in changing situations. The first=20
prototyped solutions of the run-time security management suggest=20
that a common and widely accepted security metrics ontology could be=20
developed as a joint effort between European research projects.=20

The above-mentioned projects will offer demonstrations of security=20
measurements in the workshop.
