<PRE>*** OWASP Press release ***

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has awarded 31
grants to promising application security researchers as part of the
OWASP Summer of Code 2008. The results of all these projects will be
free and open source for everyone.

Currently, having the project's selection period closed, we are
pleased to announce that 31 projects have been selected which
represent an investment of 104,000 U.S. dollars. Projects were
selected for innovation in application security and ability to deliver
high quality results before September 15, 2008.

OWASP is an all-volunteer organization, so 100% of OWASP membership
fees are used to sponsor innovative research projects. This is the
third &quot;season of code&quot; sponsored by OWASP. Details of all the projects
are available on the OWASP website:

&#183;         OWASP Summer of Code 2008 $104,000 budget
&#183;         OWASP Spring Of Code 2007 $117,500 budget
&#183;         OWASP Autumn Of Code 2006 $20,000 budget

The OWASP grant program is unique and has produced dozens of useful
tools and books, including:

&#183;         The OWASP Code Review Guide (free book)
&#183;         The OWASP Testing Guide (free 300 page book)
&#183;         The OWASP AntiSamy Rich Content Security library (free library)
&#183;         The OWASP CSRFGuard and CSRFTester tools (free tools)
&#183;         And many many more&#8230;

Projects selected for the Summer of Code 2008 include new books and
innovative tools to help developers, architects, and security
specialists ensure that applications are secure.

OWASP invites individuals and companies that benefit from OWASP
projects to join OWASP as a member. In addition to the current
Membership benefits, the new OWASP members will be able to allocate
membership fees to specific projects they are interested in.
