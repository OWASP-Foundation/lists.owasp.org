> It?s one thing to hear from leading technology professionals and pioneers at an information and applications securities conference ? but nothing beats hands on, immersive learning and training opportunities led by those same thought leaders and change makers. Imagine stepping away from your desk for two full days to explore application security automation alongside CTO of We45, Abhay Bhargav, or identifying security risks by hacking into IoT devices during an afternoon with Aditya Gupta, Founder and CEO of Attify. What if you could collaborate with global industry experts on open-source defensive security techniques and practice mitigating mobile app attacks in a real-life test environment?
>  
> During the first two days of OWASP?s 14th annual AppSecUSA conference in Orlando, Florida from September 19 ? 22, 2017, you can. Guests will have the opportunity to participate in two full-day, self-guided training sessions with other attendees and speakers such as Sebastien Deleersnyder, Managing Partner and co-founder of Belgian securities company Toreon, and many more. These pre-conference training days will set the tone for OWASP?s signature AppSecUSA event, which showcases cutting edge lectures and keynote sessions featuring securities experts from around the world in a friendly, interactive environment.
>  
> Explore the full training and lecture schedule here: https://appsecusa2017.sched.com/, or preview the conference?s announced speakers list. The conference is just a month and a half away, with registration tickets going fast and hotel accommodations filling up even faster. Don?t miss OWASP?s exclusive opportunity to learn from and rub elbows with the most senior security developers and experts out there.  No matter what industry you?re in, or where you live, this exciting, international conference is the place to be as a security and information leader.
