Waltham. Follow signs for Rt. 117 (left at the second light). When you get
to 117 turn left (West). You will cross back over Rt. 128.
Jones Rd. (look for the Waltham Weston Corporate Center sign) is the second

Subject: [Owasp-italy] Orizon project invitation
Message-ID: <e9cf3c9b0611291527y1f18082ar2bf19696718ce94d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

Orizon is a new Owasp project, born while I was preparing a
speech that I gave at SMAU, an IT Business event that took place in
Milan last October.

[ Introduction to Orizon ]

I was researching about code review and safe coding methodologies and I
realized that none of the sample tools I collected shares knowledge
about the security checks that are to be applied to the source code.
While I understand such an approach in a proprietary tool, I find that
it does not properly address the problem.
My idea is that code review tools need to share a common library
that includes bad coding patterns, unsafe code snippets, well known
source code related security branches. Therefore I started working on a
code review engine, in fact the Orizon project.

Orizon's goal is to provide three things (where the third is a direct
consequence of the first two):
a) a repository of security checks to be applied to source code during
a tool assisted code review
b) a framework for building code review security tools. By saying a
framework I mean that Orizon will provide a set of API and objects
usable by third part developers to write their tools
c) as a consequence of points a) and b), Orizon will be a
security code review tool. A small source code assessment tool will be
implemented to show Orizon API usage and it will be used of course
during source code assessments.

Orizon will be developed using Java 5 language.

[ Invitation ]
This mail would like to be an invitation to join the project. As a
matter of fact, the design phase is almost done, and I'll release a
whitepaper describing the framework architecture by next week.
A SVN repository is already up at sourceforge (links are provided at
the bottom of this mail) with a java parser built using antlr and a very
silly source file statistics collector that needs further coding.
I invite all interested people to join orizon mailing list in order
to discuss framework internals, and "how the things need to be
done"... if you are a java coder, you're also invited to hack my
code of course.

[ Thanks ]
Orizon would no exist without great tools such as lapse, pmd, rats,
splint, flawfinder. So if any of you is involved in these projects...
thank you :)
