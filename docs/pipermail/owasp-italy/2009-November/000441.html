--------------------------------------
Introduction
--------------------------------------
With the quick proliferation of complex, open and distributed systems, any
software security breach becomes a real issue that needs to be fixed since
these systems are often used in critical domains like transport, finance,
politic, etc which makes attackers more and more motivated to cause
important
damages by exploiting security vulnerabilities.

To improve the software security, several techniques have been developed
but the problem remains unsolved. The objective of this workshop is to
share
ideas, methods, techniques, and tools that help users model and detect
vulnerabilities
in software.   The workshop will try to bring together people from both
academia
and industry, from all the different areas that want to develop new
techniques
to model and detect vulnerabilities, to report their experience on using
tools or methods to detect vulnerabilities.  This workshop with try to
answer
the following questions:
? How vulnerability modelling can help user to understand the occurrence
of vulnerabilities to avoid them?
? What are the advantages/drawbacks of the existing models to represent
vulnerabilities?
Are they satisfactory?  Otherwise, how they can be improved?
? What are the existing techniques to detect vulnerabilities? Are they
satisfactory?
 Otherwise, how they can be improved?
? How verification and testing techniques can help to detect and prevent
vulnerabilities?
? How tools can help developers to detect vulnerabilities and improve the
software quality?

--------------------------------------
Topics
--------------------------------------
The workshop addresses different techniques to model and detect
vulnerabilities.
The topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

? Security requirements definition and modelling
? Security goals modelling
? Security and vulnerability modelling
? Formal approaches for vulnerability detection
? Testing and verification techniques for vulnerability detection
? Formal approaches for security validation
? Theorem proving for  vulnerability detection
? Good practises for security flaws avoidance
? Security related Tools (modelling, checking)

--------------------------------------
Important dates:

--------------------------------------
Paper submission: 15 January 2010
Notification of acceptance: 1 March 2010
Final manuscript due: 21 March 2010
Workshop: 10 April 2010

--------------------------------------
Submission Guidelines
-------------------------------------- 
Authors are invited to submit research and application papers in IEEE
Computer
Society Proceedings Manuscripts style (two columns, single-spaced,
including
figures and references, using 10 pt fonts, and number each page). Please
consult the IEEE CS Author Guidelines at the following web page:

<A HREF="http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting">http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting</A>

The workshop is open to contributions that focus on methods and tools to
modelling and detecting vulnerabilities. Industrial experience report
(success
story and even failed ones), progress, new methods and solutions in that
context are very encouraged. In all these cases, we expect well-focused
contributions
to help participants understand problems, open issues, and available
solutions,
and also to foster rich and fruitful discussions. Papers should try to be
bold and visionary, but limited to 10 pages. The emphasis should be on
defining
and setting problems, on technical details of proposed solutions, or on
the
rationale behind success stories.

Contact author must provide the following information: paper title,
authors'
names, affiliations, postal address, phone, fax, and e-mail address of the
author(s), about 200-250 word abstract, and about five keywords.

Paper registration and submission is  by email attachment (Word format) to
wissam.mallouli?replace with at-character?montimage.com

Workshop Location:
--------------------------------------
The MDV Workshop  will be held in the heart of Paris at Telecom ParisTech
(<A HREF="http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/en/">http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/en/</A>). This engineering school is situated
in the south-eastern part of the French capital, the 13th district. It is
in the middle of the picturesque district of Butte-aux-Cailles and will
benefit
from the dynamics of the economic, academic and socio-cultural activities
of
left bank of the Seine River.
