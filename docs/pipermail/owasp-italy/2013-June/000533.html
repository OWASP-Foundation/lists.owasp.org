<PRE>Buona sera,
inoltro questa interessante iniziativa.


Hi dear fellow OWASP leaders,

we are conduction a survey among senior information security leaders and
managers and need your help.
The results will be the OWASP CISO Report 2013, which shall be released
in Autumn.

Could you please help us and send on this invitation below to your
chapters and also to your security contacts in companies and
organizations? This would be a great help to achieve a broad outreach
and derive valuable data and insights for OWASP and the industry as a
whole.

Best wishes and thanks a lot for you help!

Tobias


Dear colleague,

as a respected information security executive in the industry, OWASP
(Open Web Application Security Project, www.owasp.org
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org">https://www.owasp.org</A>&gt;) would like to hear your opinion!

Link to take the CISO Survey 2013 now
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey</A>&gt;

OWASP is preparing the Global CISO report 2013 and conducting a survey
among CISOs and information security managers in relation to application
security with the aim of providing you with new insights about the state
of application security across various industry sectors and about new
security trends and aligning our efforts to better help solving the
problems of the future that you face.

The survey shall take only a few minutes of your precious time and by
completing it you are helping shape the future of OWASP, the Internet
and software security.
At the conclusion of the survey, the aggregated results will be publicly
available in the form of a report on the owasp.org website, keeping your
information completely anonymous.

As you may know OWASP is a volunteer open-source organization dedicated
to fighting the causes of software insecurity. We are also a registered
charity &amp; non-profit in the USA and the EU. See more at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP</A>

The survey can be found here: <A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey</A>

And to spice things up, during the first 14 days of June (until June-16
23:59 GMT), if you provide your contact details at the end of the
survey, you will also be entered into a drawing for one of the following
donated prizes:

  * 1 free OWASP CISO training day pass at the AppSecEU in Hamburg

&lt;<A HREF="https://appsec.eu/trainings/ciso-training-managing-web-application-security-owasp-for-senior-managers/">https://appsec.eu/trainings/ciso-training-managing-web-application-security-owasp-for-senior-managers/</A>&gt;

  * 1 free Conference Pass for OWASP AppSec USA, November 20-21, 2013 in

Thank you very much in advance for your time.

Best regards,

OWASP CISO Survey Project team
