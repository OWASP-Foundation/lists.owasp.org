Hi,

Is there any problems using CSRFGuard and IE 11. I don?t seem to get the
CSRF tokens to be injected into my .html files. Any help will be much
appreciated.

Regards,
Jugma

Hi all

I've successfully integrated CSRFGuard to one of our applications.   But being such a big and important application, I want to monitor its behaviour for a month before fully activate CSRFGuard. 

I.e.  I want to be able to see all CSRF attacks in the log file. But I want a user to continue use the application like nothing happened, even if an attack is detected. 

I tried setting commenting out all the org.owasp.csrfguard.action properties in the property file. But all it did was displaying a blank page to the user after an attack. 

Any idea?  Thanks!!

Regards,

Bruce
