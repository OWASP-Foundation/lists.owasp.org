Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] how to get first token with fetch
Message-ID: <CAE849GQYYudLNUkHnGc=7UaKB1_OABwqKLS15YU24S9yLudQMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to implement the Owasp-csrfguard in my application.
We use Java as backend and ReactJs as front-end.
We build the front-end with webpack and use the RESTful services to load
data as json object from the backend
We have already configured the back-end for testing and only an url path is
under protection, just for test.

I am using *fetch *on the front-end to GET/POST/PUT  data from/to back-end

Reading the documentation it seems not possible to inject the token via
ajax.
But I read also:
*Do a token pre-fetch on every page.*

*Instead of hard coding the CSRF token, we send a POST request to fetch the
token and populate the JS variable.*

Can you please help me to find out how to get the first token because as
soon as I get one protected path I got the error.


Thanks in advance

Remo
