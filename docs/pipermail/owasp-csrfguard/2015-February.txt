Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] ModeSecurity
Message-ID: <3E22B7A85185934690FAB9B6335DDC588E754E@Bella.medcon.com>

Hi,

We are looking for solution to protect against CSRF attack, and come across ModeSecurity Open source,
Our services and web application's running on IIS,

In this article
http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2011/08/detecting-malice-with-modsecurity-updated-csrf-attacks.html
its describe how one can implement CSRF attacks using ModeSecurity and  "OWASP ModSecurity CRS Project"
there is a link to .Net implementations so it can run on IIS,
there is  a link to a web site, that show a solution Witten in  .Net, but it's not fully implemented,
and  not supported any longer:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/.Net_CSRF_Guard

can you help me with better understanding how I can use ModeSecurity  using the OWSAP library over IIs.

Thanks in advance,
Asaf

Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] Recursion error for Ajax requests in Firefox and
	chrome
Message-ID: <CAOGD+YMTpHqfVgvNicZJS73Kpi28cEqo7EYb_89Siof4up3OCQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am implementing CSRFGuard in our project and ran into a problem with Ajax
requests.When I submit a request from a jsp page to another jsp which makes
an Ajax call on loading, the recursion occurs (It works fine in IE). The
recursion seems to be happening at the XMLHttpRequest open function,
XMLHttpRequest.prototype._open = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open;
XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open = function(method, url, async, user, pass) {
this.url = url;
console.log("open: "+url+" this: "+this); // Comment
this._open.apply(this, arguments);
};

The recursion reaches to max stack size and fails eventually. I attached
the web.xml and xsrfguard.properties files for your reference and kindly
let me know if any other details required.

The comment displays the following message continuously
 open:  /axamps/JavaScriptServlet  this: [object XMLHttpRequest]


Thanks in advance
Karthi

Message-ID: <CAOGD+YPm5Fkqb=2mETDOpQjk=HHzeuVxjBicBeCZSGF7CUFPwQ@mail.gmail.com>

I found the problem after analyzing the JSP code. The target jsp page
conditionally includes another jsp which also has JavaScriptServlet script
element. This caused the recursion and the removal of JavaScriptServlet
fixed the problem

Hello:

 

I want to use CSRF Gurad to solve CSRF Security

vulnerability issue. But we are using Java 1.4 in our project 

Could you please let me know whether there is any CSRFGuard version
available

that can be used for Java 1.4

or any other recommendation for Java 1.4 to prevent CSRF

 

thank you much
