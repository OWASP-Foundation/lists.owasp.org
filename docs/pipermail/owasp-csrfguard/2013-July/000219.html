I have added CSRFGuard to an existing project which is based on JSF using Seam 2.2.&#160; My initial testing was very positive, until I started testing use cases which generated exceptions.&#160; What I am finding is that Seam (or JSF) error handling is being interfered with by CSRFGuard.&#160;
As a result, I can get into a situation where the app is frozen, and you can't even call up the app from a new tab with the login url.&#160; I have to restart the server in order to get any pages to work.&#160; The only thing I have found which allows me to proceed is to invalidate the session when
any potential CSRF attack is detected, by using the configuration option: &quot;org.owasp.csrfguard.action.Invalidate=org.owasp.csrfguard.action.Invalidate&quot;.&#160; Of course, this is extremely unfriendly, as the user is suddenly returned to the login page with no warning or message about
why.
I tried to configure an error page to redirect to by using:
org.owasp.csrfguard.action.Redirect=org.owasp.csrfguard.action.Redirect
org.owasp.csrfguard.action.Redirect.Page=/CSRFError.html
but even this doesn't work as the conflict between Seam and CSRFGuard prevents the redirect from being processed.&#160; Basically, Seam is stuck in error mode, and there is nothing I have been able to do about it.
Does anyone have
any suggestions?&#160; Has anyone else had a similar problem?&#160; I'm sure that there could equally well be conflicts with other frameworks besides JSF with Seam. &#160; I am about to remove CSRFGuard and use Seam's s:token tag to protect the POST requests - which, of course, leaves GET
unprotected.&#160; I'd really rather not get into that, if there is some clever configuration I could use which would enable me to continue to use CSRFGuard.
Thanks in advance,
Ray Clough
