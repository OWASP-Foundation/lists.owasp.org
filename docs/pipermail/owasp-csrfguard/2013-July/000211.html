Hi Ming,

Thanks for the update. I've almost given up on CSRFGuard now, as our application must be able to run on IE8 but it seems that it's not compatible. Ajax request headers are not being populated with the CSRF token in IE8, but works fine in firefox and IE9+

Tom

Tom,

I am using an older version of CSRFGuard, build 3.0.0.503, because of the latest/newest version has more bugs than I expected and my application failed to run without heavy modification of the CSRFGuard's Java source codes. 

Anyway, in my case, CSRFGuard 3.0.0.503 failed to add the OWASP_CSRFTOKEN to the URL (example, /root/myServlet) on the Form's Action element. In Owasp.CsrfGuard.js, the line, form.getAttribute(&quot;action&quot;), returns XMLHttpInput (I cannot remember the exact name) object instead of a String value (/root/myServlet ) of Action element on IE. In order to get the String value (/root/myServlet), form.attributes[&quot;action&quot;].value is the option for my environment (IE browser + a remote IBM WebSphere application server). Interestingly, the original code, form.getAttribute(&quot;action&quot;), is working fine when both IE and IBM Websphere Application server are running on the same local machine though. 

In short, I learned the new code, Form.attributes[&quot;action&quot;].value, works fine for Firefox, Chrome, and IE.


Thanks,
Ming

Hi Ming,

I've been stumped on this for a while now, what does your suggestion fix exactly? It's only XMLHttpRequests that IE is failing on for me and not sure if your suggestions affect those.

Feel free to update directly on stack overflow, I'm monitoring that post (I raised it originally) 

Thanks

Tom

Since I've heard nothing back from the community, I have updated my finding with the following link.
