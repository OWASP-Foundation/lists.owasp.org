Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] How to specify URL pattern for
	protection/unprotected
Message-ID: <5119E34D.7080503@verizon.net>

Hello:

I just started using CSRFGuard.
The first issue I am having is that I can not find a way to
specify which url should be protected and which are now.

I have two url requests  like

/actionName
/actionName?p1=v1&p2=v2

Each returns different contents. I'd like /actionName  unprotected
and /actionName?p1=v1&p2=v2   as protected
How do I specify it?

Another issue is the org.owasp.csrfguard.servlet.JavaScriptServlet
(the one send javascript on the fly).  I have configured it  exactly as 
in the doc
but browser keeps getting resource not found.  I copy/pasted  the 
JavaScriptServlet.java
and save it to my own source tree and renamed the servlet class name in 
web.xml to mine
and it gets without error.

Thanks in advance.

-TS

I believe CSRFGaurd ignores any query parameters, so I don't think this 
is possible.

I'm not familiar with this part of CSRFGuard.

Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] How do I redirect for Invalid token for an AJAX

Does the CSRFGuard JavaScript support the redirect to error page in case of an Ajax request with incorrect or no token ?

Thanks,
