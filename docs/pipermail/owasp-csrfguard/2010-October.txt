Howdy Mr. Manico.  

I love the podcast.  Keep up the good work.

I'm still on this.  I submitted some changes to CSRFGuard about a year
ago and stayed on the list to hear about new releases and changes.

Hello there. J

 

The OWASP CSRF guard project (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_CSRFGuard_Project ) has
recently been deemed "inactive" and I'm trying to help bring it back to
life.

 

I'm taking a survey of folks who have used CSRFGuard. In particular, I would
like to understand any potential modifications CSRFGuard users have had  to
make in order to implement it successfully for their website. I'd also like
to hear of any success stories of using CSRFGuard out of the box.

 

Any feedback regarding this matter is greatly appreciated. 

 

Thanks kindly + Aloha,

Why thank you for that kind comment, the podcast is a labor of love :)

Have your submitted changes to CSRF guard been approved?

Do you have any interest in taking lead on the CSRF Guard project, Cameron? It should not take up much of your time once we get back to production quality, I'll help, It's high visibility, it's in deep need of fine-tuning, and may do great things for your career. 

Thanks again, and let us know if you are interested!

- Jim

I would love to see the project keep going, and I am willing to take the
lead on it if needed.

To use CSRFGuard at partnet we needed to have the tokens shared across
multiple webapps deployed on the same server.  The changes we submitted
have not been included in any release.  Our changes optionally store the
CSRF tokens on the subject with a JAAS login module.  It also adds a
interface for different token generating strategies, since we weren't
happy with the existing strategy.  Here is a link to more details
(https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-csrfguard/2009-August/000002.html)

For our non-struts2 projects we use CSRFGuard (our custom build of it) but
we built a struts2 solution that works with CSRFGuard projects. For
struts2 projects we built an interceptor that enforces the token.  The
nice thing about the interceptor is we can annotate the actions as needing
forgery protection or not (it can be either black-list or white-list).  We
also changed the jsp side so that struts tags add the tokens for forms and
links and buttons and so on.  If people our interested in our struts2
solution I'm sure I could get approval to contribute this to owasp (or
struts2).

I have great news!

Eric Sheridan, the original author of CSRGGuard, is stepping back into 
the ring.

 From Eric this morning:

>  I have renewed energy to begin actively working on and maintaining 
this project against, starting ASAP. There is a significant amount of 
code refactoring that I will be doing (as I wrote most code over 2 yrs 
ago) followed by a series of usability and bug update

I'll help some as well.

Can you think of anything that needs to be done to make CSRFGuard a more 
production quality product? Do we need more documentation? Should we get 
this project into SonaType/Maven? What else should we do to make 
CSRFGuard the best CSRF defense project on the planet? :)

Please let us know here on the list, or add a new entry to the CSRFGuard 
code repository at http://code.google.com/p/owaspcsrfguard/issues/entry

Aloha and thanks all,
Jim
