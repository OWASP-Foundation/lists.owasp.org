Hello CSRF guard Team,


We're working on a project on JSF 2 for which we want to introduce CSRF
guard. The problem is that I couldn't find any steady *maven *repository
from which to download the CSRFGuard artifacts. We do not want to introduce
a lib folder in our project with this one single artifact.

So, do you have a maven repository with csrfGuard API ?


Thanks,
Victor
