Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard]  IOException
Message-ID: <222ec6d529ec40939e5163bda0cc923f@DE-D1-M035.united-it.net>


Hello all...

I have implemented OWASP-CSRF guard solution for my application (Java version : 1.7).
Everything is working properly except that I am getting IOException in logs:

SCHWERWIEGEND: Servlet.service() for servlet JavaScriptServlet threw exception
java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: This output stream has already been closed
        at org.owasp.csrfguard.util.Streams.close(Streams.java:59)
        at org.owasp.csrfguard.servlet.JavaScriptServlet.writePageTokens(JavaScriptServlet.java:213)
        at org.owasp.csrfguard.servlet.JavaScriptServlet.doPost(JavaScriptServlet.java:156)

Cause : when  JavaScriptServlet class calls writePageTokens() method to close the outputStream, the exception is thrown.
Kindly let me know how this issue can be fixed.

Thanks & Regards,
Subha C
