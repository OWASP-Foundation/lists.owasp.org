Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] CSRFGuard Release Date
Message-ID: <OF68D775F3.738A4B20-ON862579DC.0071C50A-862579DC.0071CF4E@securian.com>

Hello all, 

There was discussion in another thread noting a new release of CSRFGuard. 
Like the other poster, we would like to use the latest code available, but 
are unable to unless it has been officially released. 

Does anyone have an official release date for the newer version? 

Thanks, 
Jason Lindquist
