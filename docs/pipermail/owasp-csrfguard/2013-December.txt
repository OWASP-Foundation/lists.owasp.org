Hi,
&nbsp;
I am trying to use the source from https://github.com/esheri3/OWASP-CSRFGuard and my need is to use the library in web application using IBM Websphere 6.1 server.
&nbsp;
I am seeing it is written for Maven, so please let me know if IBM websphere based project is also available.
&nbsp;
I am bit new to this, so please let me know the feasibility of using the CSRFguard in IBM server.
&nbsp;
Thanks
Ragha

Dear Sir,
I ma the Leader of this project.
You can use the CSRFGuard library with IBM WS as JavaEE filter.

OWASP CSRFGuard utilizes request tokens to address Cross-Site Request
Forgery.  CSRF is an attack where the victim is tricked into interacting
with a website where they are already authenticated.
CSRFGuard Provides code to generate unique request tokens to mitigate CSRF
risks.

You can integrate the source code using you own method (if you don't use
Maven).

The following link show how to integrate CSRFGuard with you application :

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRFGuard_3_Installation

If you have any question contact me.
Regards,
Azzeddine RAMRAMI
