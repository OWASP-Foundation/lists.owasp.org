Fantastic.  Good luck with the refactor.  I'll help if needed.

One thought off the top of my head is relating to the out bound
re-writter.  Our development team was turned off to the outbound
re-writter since we already have a re-writter, site-mesh, and we worried
about performance in having two.  So one thought of improvement could be
making siteMesh work with CSRFGuard to insert the Tokens.  I haven't put
too much thought into it, just throwing it out there for consideration.

Thanks Cam. Nice suggestion. :)

Would you mind throwing this comment into the Google code tracker:

http://code.google.com/p/owaspcsrfguard/issues/entry 
<http://code.google.com/p/owaspcsrfguard/updates/list>

If you don't have a Google account, let me know, I'll toss it in there 
for you.

And thanks again for the offer to help. CSRFGuard really is a pretty 
amazing product - a little love will go a along way.

Cheers,
Jim

PS: Anyone else have outstanding issues they would like to see resolved? 
Any features you would like to see implemented? Please add your very 
wise thoughts to the CSRFGuard Google code issue tracker 
http://code.google.com/p/owaspcsrfguard/issues/entry 
<http://code.google.com/p/owaspcsrfguard/updates/list> (In addition to 
sending thoughts to the elist here, discussion is good!)

Long time no talk/see! As Jim recently pointed out on a few mailing lists, I
am getting back into an active role of developing and leading this project.
I will be going through the email archive to collect any patches/updates for
integration consideration. I recently re-wrote CSRFGuard from the ground up
to address general code quality problems but to also address significant
problems that I know teams ran into using CSRFGuard. I'll be making OWASP
Wiki updates to reflect some of these changes and to layout a meaningful
roadmap. Thus, version 3 is underway...

-Eric
