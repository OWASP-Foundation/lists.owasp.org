Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] CSRFGuard 3.1 - unexpected token in csrfguard.js
Message-ID: <HK2PR01MB137951D065ED71054E723170E2FD0@HK2PR01MB1379.apcprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi,

I am trying to add CSRFGuard for our website. I managed to configure CSRFGuard and I see the token in my pages but there is an error in the JavaScript:

function isValidDomain(current, target) {
                           var result = false;

                           /** check exact or subdomain match **/
                           if(current == target) {
                                        result = true;
                           } else if( %DOMAIN_STRICT% == false) {
                                        if(target.charAt(0) == '.') {
                                                     result = current.endsWith(target);
                                        } else {
                                                     result = current.endsWith('.' + target);
                                        }

                           }

                           return result;
             }


This happens for all the attributes of the JavaScriptServlet with % tag. Please help.

Best Regards,
Rachna Jain
