Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] CSRFGuard IE8 compatibility
Message-ID: <CANFHNUzyJRia0bEuPcQR=wN8sc1-XVi-2ME-Xj4QzA2fxHDrSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

At the outset, I want to congratulate OWASP for its efforts in getting a
framework available for CSRF anti-tokens. This is really a plug-and-play
kind of implementation.

But then, I am facing an issue with the same while implementing the same
for IE8 browser. I get an error related to
XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open
is not an object.

Later I found that, IE8 doesnt have proper Event handling API. Please let
me know what is the way forward on this issue.



Yours sincerely,

Sridhar Vedhanabatla
