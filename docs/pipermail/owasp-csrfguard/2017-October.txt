Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] CSRF Security Fix to OWASP 3.0
Message-ID: <CAFxY7sHNnrhYS10SZHY=37fr2s-sc1UjfnmD0be3uPBd5y79hQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
The OWASP 3.1.0 readme mentions about an important security fix.
"Instead of hard coding the CSRF token, we send a POST request to fetch the
token and populate the JS variable."

I'm looking for some background on the security fix. Could someone please
point me to a bug tracker link or other documentation about the fix?

Thanks,
Sriram K
