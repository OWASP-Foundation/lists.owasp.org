Hi, I've started to use OWASP CSRFGuard in projects but have faced with next issue: 

adding "org.owasp.csrfguard.unprotected.Favicon=%servletContext%/img/favicon.ico" or "org.owasp.csrfguard.unprotected.Favicon=*/favicon.ico" to config has no effect. So I can't figure out what the problem and I hope for your help. 


Thanks in advance, best regards guys. 
Emirali.
