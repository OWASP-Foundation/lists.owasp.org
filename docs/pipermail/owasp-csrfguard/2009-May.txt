Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] CSRFGuard in Classic ASP
Message-ID: <6F89465F126951489F164A078F516E69056FA0BA@red.ultradata.com.au>

Hi,

I'm a developer on a web application written in classic ASP.

I'm looking to implement protection against CSRF. Is there a version
designed to run with classic ASP, or is it possible to setup and
environment to run CSRFGuard with classic ASP

Thanks

Steve
