Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] custom logger with session information
Message-ID: <CANZ6e7xJn+LAMnhNPAAFRgzkogDwvKHRrtG8WF6e4K-E5zstWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I see that you can specify a custom logger here:
org.owasp.csrfguard.Logger

or you can use the default ConsoleLogger and i guess customize this message:
org.owasp.csrfguard.action.Log.Message

I was curious... I wanted to get some data about the user who triggers a
cross site forgery...
I have an int member_id and String member_full_name stored in the a session
object...
How can I go about getting the session values into the ConsoleLogger
message?

If I need a Custom Logger (which implements the ILogger interface) to
replace ConsoleLogger, what can I do in that class to get access to the
Session?

Thanks for any guidance :),
-Ari

Hi Team,

We have implemented CSRF3 to fix CSRF issue .  All the images, links and script tags are updated with OWASP tokens. It is working without any issues in all the browser except IE9. The web pages has Menus' and it is being generated by javascript <script>.  After we enable the csrfguard,  the menus are not displaying the submenus' when mouse over on the menus. This issue occurs only in IE9.

Issue Summary :

Browser : IE9. (works in IE10, Firefox and chrome)

Kindly let me know if you have any fixes for this issue with respect to browser IE9.

Subject: [Owasp-csrfguard] CSRF Guard Version for Java 1.4
Message-ID: <CAJ=ZsyyOgKW75huQuhs9=bnuK8Rg3SVccJ72Skgu4qoAvy3gnw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to use CSRF Gurad Version 3 or 2.2 or 2.0 to solve CSRF Security
vulnerability issue. But we are using Java 1.4 in our project and i
observed usage of Java 5 in all the above CSRFGuard versions.  Could you
please let me know whether there is any other CSRFGuard version available
that can be used for Java 1.4.

Thanks & Regards,
Vamsi Krishna
