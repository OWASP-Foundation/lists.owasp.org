Hei

Neste medlemsmøte går av stabelen 19. mars. Vi har vært så heldige å få 
Jim Manico til Norge, sponset av F5!
Klokkeslett og sted kommer vi tilbake til, men det blir trolig
kl 17 et sted sentralt i Oslo.

Agenda:
"Web Application Access Control Design Excellence", Jim Manico

Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer 
within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key access 
control anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits. These 
access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, lack of 
horizontal access control, and "fail open" access control mechanisms. In 
reviewing these and other access control problems, we will discuss and 
design a positive access control mechanism that is data contextual, 
activity based, configurable, flexible, and deny-by-default - among other 
positive design attributes that make up a robust web-based access-control 
mechanism.

Subject: [Owasp-norway] CFP - Dedicated Security track @ ROOTs 2012 Bergen,

All, Jim,

As a following up to the 'outside the O' I want to let you know the ROOTs
Conference in Bergen, Norway, is dedicating a track to (application)
security:http://www.rootsconf.no/

Continuously, I am looking for developer conferences and events to speak
about application security.
In my experience, developer are more then willing, they (mostly) just did
not know as they are not thought about security.
Anyway, security is getting more important and the need to know about
security becomes more and more visual. Last is most definite as you see
developer events do look for security experts!

Have replied to the CFP for the security track at the ROOTs conference
2012, I hope others might be interested and follow!
For me, it will be the third time to be in Bergen. A small conference with
high value!

Cheers,
-Martin
