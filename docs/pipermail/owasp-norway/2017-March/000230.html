#ToyFail: Is you child safe from the Internet of Things?

Martin Gravråk - Software Developer &amp; Kristian Løken Wille - IT Consultant
@ Bouvet

Security and Privacy are two major concerns with the Internet of Things,
and are especially important when children are involved. In this session,
we&#8217;ll tell you what happened when the Norwegian Consumer Council asked us
to investigate the inner workings of a selection of internet connected
toys. Our findings shocked both us and our customer, and lead to worldwide
media coverage. We&#8217;ll share our methods for testing the toys, and show you
examples of what we found. You&#8217;ll also learn about various techniques for
finding out how secure your own devices are, what these devices know about
you and where this information ends up. There will be demonstrations on how
we use tools like Fidder, WireShark and Decompilers, there will be movies
and there will be toys!


Broken crypto is broken

Erlend Oftedal

We using an increasing amount of crypto in our code to protect our assets.
However we can easily go wrong if we don't know how to use it correctly. In
this talk we will look at what can go wrong when crypto is used the wrong
way. We will NOT dive into the algorithms themselves, but look at what the
different primitives give us and what happens when our expectations are
wrong.
