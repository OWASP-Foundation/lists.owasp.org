Hi all,

AppSecEU 2014 is approaching quickly and we have lots of great speakers and
exciting presentations and trainings for you.
Your opportunity to discuss with the best in our field, hear the latest
security tech presentations and learn and have a lot of fun.

This year AppSecEU will be in Cambridge, just a short 1-hour train ride
from London.
We got a great venue at Anglia Ruskin University?s Cambridge campus and
will on June-25 have a stylish conference dinner in the Victorian Gothic
style Great Hall at Homerton College. An evening event not to miss. :-)

*AppSecEU** 2014*
*Date: June 23-26*



*Venue: Cambridge, Anglia Ruskin University Program: Conference
(June-25/26)*
The main conference will be on June 25th and 26th with lots of amazing
keynote speakers flying in, and tech talks about the latest on mobile
security, hacking web applications and how to defend them, to management
topics like lots of best practices and stuff that works. And while there,
you'll have the opportunity to meet and discuss with your peers and
industry experts and also visit tables from our sponsors in the hallway,
who will show their latest tools and products at the exhibition hall.
*T**r**ainings (June-23/24)*
Before that on June-23th and 24th we have 1- and 2-day training classes and
bootcamps where you can dive deep into the technical problems and learn
from the leading experts in the field (and see how deep the rabbit hole
goes). The classes will be about mobile app security, injection flaws,
WebHacking, defensive programming and writing secure code, up to management
trainings about openSAMM and a CISO training about managing application
security for senior managers.

Here the link to the conference page:
https://2014.appsec.eu

And for your registration:
https://2014.appsec.eu/registering-for-the-conference/

(For your convenience, we also secured a block of very affordable rooms
close to the venue - but better book quickly as they go fast.)

Please spread the word among your colleagues and friends and looking
forward to seeing you all end of June in Cambridge!

Cheers, Tobias

Hei

Det ligger et nytt medlemsmøte her:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Norway/events/188627202/

*Tweetdeck was XSSed using unicode in June 2014. If you want to understand
how these kinds of attacks work, you should really come see this talk. *

*If you think you know how unicode is handled in JavaScript, server-side
code and databases, you should come see this talk.*

*If you don't care about unicode, you really need to see this talk.*


*This presentation explores common mistakes made by programmers when
dealing with Unicode support and character encodings on the Web. Foreach
mistake, I will explain how to fix/prevent it, but also how it could
possibly be exploited.*

*Speaker: Mathias Bynens is a Belgian web standards freak. He likes HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, Unicode, performance, and security. At Opera Software he?s
a member of the Developer Relations team.*

Med vennlig hilsen
Erlend

Subject: [Owasp-norway] NordSec 2014 - Poster Session - Call for Posters
Message-ID: <F0704306C70EFC49AC55034BFC33B10027F40E85@wrex.ita.chalmers.se>

[Apologies for multiple copies]

Dear OWASPers in the north,

NordSec is an annual conference on topics within IT security, which brings together IT security researchers and encourages interaction between academia and industry, especially in the north. This year it takes place in Tromsø, Norway, October 15-17.

  http://site.uit.no/nordsec2014/

If you (or those you represent) are interested in collaborating with researchers on IT security, or in knowing what IT security researchers in the north are up to, this venue is for you.

If you have an idea or experience of interest to IT security enthusiasts, then the following poster session is a great way to discuss it, start conversation, and present yourself.

Best regards,
Dr. Willard Rafnsson
Chalmers University of Technology

NordSec 2014 - Poster Session - Call for Posters

The NordSec 2014 Poster Session aims at facilitating discussions about research and co-operation between young Nordic researchers and is co-organised by the Swedish IT Security Network for PhD students SWITS and the Norwegian Research School of Computer and Information Security COINS.

Especially PhD students from the Nordic countries are invited to submit poster abstracts describing recent research or ongoing research in progress or experiences in all areas of information security and privacy. Poster abstracts can also summarise work that [has been or] will be published in more detail as a full paper elsewhere.

Submissions should be one to two pages long and use the Springer LNCS format and should not be anonymised. They will be reviewed by the NordSec poster session programme committee and selected poster abstracts will also be published in the NordSec LNCS proceedings.

During NordSec 2014 there will be a poster session for the presentation of all posters, in which the audience can also give their votes for the best poster presentation award. NordSec is held in Tromsø, Norway, October 15-17, 2014.

Important dates:
   - 6th July 2014: Deadline for submission of poster abstracts
   - 21st July 2014: Notification
