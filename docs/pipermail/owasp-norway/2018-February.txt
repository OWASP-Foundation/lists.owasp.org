*#WatchOut - Serious vulnerabilities in smart watches for children*

In October 2017, the Norwegian Consumer Council (Forbrukerrådet) and
mnemonic published the #WatchOut campaign, revealing severe security flaws
in smart GPS watches marketed towards children and parents. Among other
things, we found that it was possible for an unauthorized party to:

- take control of the watch through the companion app,
- eavesdrop on and communicate with the child without the parent knowing,
- track the child's movements, and also make it look like the child is
somewhere he or she is not.

Harrison Sand and myself will talk about the #WatchOut project from a
technical perspective, going in-depth about how we did our research and
analysis, and what we discovered. We will also discuss what happened in the
aftermath of going public with our findings together with Forbrukerrådet.

There will probably be time for some open discussion on digital consumer
rights and IoT security in general.

Note: This presentation will be given in English.
