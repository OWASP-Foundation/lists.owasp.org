Dear Kaare,

Registration for SecAppDev 2016, an intensive week-long immersion course in
secure application development, is now open. The course is organised by
secappdev.org, a non-profit organisation that aims to broaden security
awareness in the development community and advance secure software
engineering practices. The course is a joint initiative with KU Leuven and
Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management.

This year we again pride ourselves in a stellar line-up. SecAppDev 2016's
faculty includes
+ Prof. dr. ir. Bart Preneel who heads Cosic, the renowned crypto lab.
+ Ken van Wyk, co-founder of the CERT Coordination Center and widely
  acclaimed author and teacher.
+ Jim DelGrosso who runs the architectural practice at Cigital.
+ Author and founder of SSL Labs, Ivan Ristic, is a key figure in today's
  drive to adopt TLS.

And there are many more world-class speakers, see
https://secappdev2016.sched.org/directory/speakers.

The course takes place from March 7th to 11th in the Faculty Club, Leuven,
Belgium.

For more information visit the web site, https://www.secappdev.org.

Places are limited, so do not delay registering to avoid disappointment.

Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis.  A 25% discount is
available for Early Bird registration until January 15th. Alumni, public
servants and independents receive a 50% discount. 

We hope we will be able to welcome you or your colleagues to our course.
