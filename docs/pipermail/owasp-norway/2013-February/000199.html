<PRE>Hei

Det er fremdeles ledige plasser på dagens OWASP-møte:

*&quot;A language based approach to securing mashups&quot;*

15 years have passed since the &#8220;same-origin policy&#8221; (SOP) was introduces,
with the purpose to control the interaction between web sites. Web sites of
today, in particular so called mashups, differ radically in how they
interact compared to 15 years ago, and the SOP has become an obstacle that
needs to be circumvented. Despite numerous hacks and efforts to control
interactions in a secure manner, this problem continues to be challenging.
On-going research at Chalmers investigates using language-based techniques
to control the flow of information, and by doing so maintaining the hich
level of interaction without making compromises in security.


*&quot;Crossing Origins by Crossing Formats&quot;*

In a heterogeneous system like the web, information is exchanged between
components in versatile formats. A new breed of attacks is on the rise that
exploit the mismatch between the expected and provided content. We identify
the root cause of a large class of attacks: polyglots. A polyglot is a
program that is valid in multiple programming languages. Polyglots allow
multiple interpretations of the content, providing a new space of attack
vectors. We characterize of what constitutes a dangerous format in the web
setting and identify particularly dangerous formats, with PDF as the prime
example. We demonstrate that polyglot-based attacks on the web open up for
insecure communication across Internet origins.

*Jonas Magazinius* is a PhD student in the Language-based Security group at
Chalmers University of Technology. The focus of his research is
information-flow in mash-up web applications. Jonas is specialized in web
application security, but is interested in most aspects of security. When
not immersed in JavaScript, Jonas helps organize events in the OWASP
Gothenburg chapter.&#8221;
