<PRE>Hei

som sponsor med både lokale og mat.
Påmelding kan gjøres på:

til undertegnede (dersom du ikke ønsker å lage konto på meetup.com).

Vel møtt!


Agenda:

*Personal security*
You are one of the most significant security threats to your company. We
all know we are going to fix better passwords / encryption / firewalls /
etc. one day. Getting properly hacked is one of those things that is a lot
more comfortable to prevent beforehand than to gather the shattered pieces
afterwards. In this talk, we will take a practical approach to good
personal digital security. We will start with the easy parts before
drilling through the layers of security, down to the parts that are
unpredictable and dangerous. Bring your laptop and a tin foil hat.
Topics include: What it's like to get properly hacked. Using password
managers. Operating system security. Browser security. Encryption,
firewalls, factors, and other means of protection.
*Michael Johansen* is a software consultant at Knowit during the day and a
startup founder during the night. At NTNU I studied entrepreneurship,
computer science and psychology. During my studies I also took a year off
to be a board member at NTNU's Board of Directors. As part of my startup
venture I've gotten first-hand experience with the startup scene in both
Boston and in Silicon Valley. Humans and machines are the two things that
interest me the most. I'm a bit systematic.
I care more than most people about personal security, and it's a topic on
which I'd like to share my insights.


*Hacking with Hardware: Tools for Physical Intrusion and Persistent Network
Access*
Reading about the latest zero-day vulnerabilities can be fun (or scary),
but what about known vulnerabilities from years or even decades ago? When
it comes to technologies like USB, wireless mice and access cards, many old
vulnerabilities are still around, largely ignored in risk assessments and
easier than ever to exploit in style, due to the availability of versatile,
low-cost hardware gadgets. If humans are tool-using animals, hackers are
gadget-using humans.In this presentation attendees will see examples of
real physical and short range wireless attacks that will work against most
organizations to bypass security controls and gain persistent physical
access to the target facility and its network. Yes, billions of people can
attack you from the Internet&#8212;that doesn&#8217;t mean you should forget about the
ones who walk through the front door.
*Ryan Mattinson* is a penetration tester and managing consultant in KPMG
Norway's cyber defence practice. He will share stories from the trenches
and introduce some of his favorite gadgets anyone can buy online or easily
build at home to get into a target organization's buildings and onto their
network.
