Hei

Denne månedens møte er et samarbeid med Hackeriet, og vi kjører
møtet hos Hackeriet. Det blir en blanding av presentasjon og praktiske
øvelser så ta med laptop.
Foredragsholder er Eireann Leverett (GB).

Informasjon finner du her: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Norway

Påmelding skjer på Hackeriets meetupside: 
http://www.meetup.com/hackeriet/events/39973222/


Agenda:
"Let me Shodan that for you...", Eireann Leverett
Workshops are fun. Let's have one.
Bring your laptop and willingness to write ten simple lines of code in 
Perl, Python, or Ruby. Even if you can't code, come by and learn to use 
Shodan the computer search engine through the web interface. While the 
speaker will share a tiny bit of what he did with this tool, the focus 
will be on what you could be using it for...this is a interactive 
workshop, not a boring seminar.
Keywords for interest: banner grabbing, network scanning, application 
deployment profiling, security research, geolocation, security 
visualisation, network exploration, open source intelligence, fun.
Eireann Leverett spent six months working with 'Shodan the computer search 
engine'. It's an under-rated tool that was developed by John Matherly. 
John has given you a surprisingly big gift, why not learn to use it?
