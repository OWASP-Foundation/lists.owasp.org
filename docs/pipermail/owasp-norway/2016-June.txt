Agenda:

*Moriarty Hacking i 2016 - Chris Dale*
Your solution is deployed in the cloud, it should be secure. After all, it
only exposes a simple login field, and it has already been scrutinized by
penetration-testers for vulnerabilities. It should be safe? But it wasn?t!
You still got owned, and you got owned BIG TIME! This talk will show how a
criminal advances through a seemingly hardened solution, fully compromising
the solution. The talk will demonstrate how the attacker takes over a
customers entire domain, but also how the attacker is able to in fact
compromise the cloud solution itself. Attacking the IaaS infrastructure
provider

*CSP: RIP XSS - Christian Wenz*
Cross-Site Scripting is one of the main risks for web applications - a
position it holds since over a decade! With Content Security Policy, this
threat may finally find its end. The W3C standard provides techniques to
close many XSS vectors, offers fine-grained control over the security
limitations you impose, and enjoys a decent browser support. We will show
what CSP is capable of, focusing on new features in CSP 2, and also discuss
how you may need to refactor your website.


Mvh,
