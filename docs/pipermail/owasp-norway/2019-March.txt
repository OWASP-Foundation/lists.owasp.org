Sted: Teknologihuset, Pilestredet 56, Oslo

Stian Kristoffersen from Deepinsight will come and talk about security
of machine learning.

Machine Learning (ML) continues to be a trendy tool for many types of
problems, including security. But is ML itself secure? This talk will
give an introduction to attacks on ML like changing predictions,
recovering sensitive information, and stealing someone else's models.
Examples include misdirection by changing a few pixels in an image, by
using 3D printed models, and by hiding long messages in short sound
bites. We will conclude with some current research directions to
mitigate these attacks. Prior experience with ML is useful, but not
required.

Pizza and soda will be served at the meetup, sponsored by Deepinsight
(https://deepinsight.io/).

A big thanks to mnemonic (https://www.mnemonic.no/) for supporting the
OWASP Norway Day 2018 as a platinum sponsor.

Beklager å inntreffe på postlisten din, men jeg må la medlemmene i
[Owasp-norge] vite at OWASP Foundation slår ned alle postlister som drives
av Mailman på lists.owasp.org 22. mars 2019.

Her er en en-klikk-kobling for å bli med i den nye Google-gruppen som
erstatter denne listen:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/norway-chapter/join

Den nye gruppen er også tilgjengelig online på:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/norway-chapter

Detaljert informasjon om hvordan du går med i gruppen er på
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA

MERK: Du må ikke ha en Google-konto, en @ owasp.org-e-postadresse, eller å
oppgi telefonnummeret ditt for å bli med og delta i den nye
norge-kapittelgruppen - bare en e-postadresse.

Til slutt, fulle detaljer om planen om å trekke tilbake Mailman, koblinger
og vanlige spørsmål er på:

What Ståle said is correct - thanks for the post.

My apologies, there was a bug in the automation used to generate these
notices and for the lists effected by that bug, I re-sent an email with
correct links.

BTW, you can also just send an email to norway-chapter+subscribe at owasp.org
and follow the instructions in the response.

Cheers!

	on March 22nd
Message-ID: <201903151739.x2FHdvVp021936@lists.owasp.org>

Sorry to intrude on your mail list again but I need to remind the Owasp-norway list members that the OWASP Foundation is shutting down all the mail lists run by Mailman on lists.owasp.org on March 22, 2019. This is the 2nd of 3 notifications to all list members.

Here is a one-click link to join the new Google Group which is replacing this list:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/norway-chapter/join

You can also join by sending an email to norway-chapter+subscribe at owasp.org

The new Group is also available online at:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/norway-chapter

Detailed Information on how join the Group is at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA

NOTE:  You are NOT required to have a Google account, an @owasp.org email address, or to provide your phone number to join and participate in the new Group at norway-chapter at owasp.org - just an email address.

Finally, full details on the plan to retire Mailman, links and FAQs are  at: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL

Thanks for your past and future contributions to our community!
