Dear project members,



Yesterday our project was presented at the German OWASP Day
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/German_OWASP_Day_2014/Programm> in Hamburg
and we received very positive feedback. People were impressed how fast we
made progress.

Another presentation is planned for 5 March 2015 at the IAPP Global Privacy
Summit in Washington, DC and we will participate at the IPEN panel at CDPD
on 22 January in Brussels. Feel free to present the project in your
organization as well. We can provide slides.



Currently we are working on the evaluation of our project to get from the
status of an OWASP ?Incubator Project? to a ?Lab Project? (see also: OWASP
Project Categories <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project>).




Furthermore we start collecting countermeasures to address the risks
identified
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project#tab=Top_10_Privacy_Risks>
and we need your help with that. Please insert your references and ideas
for countermeasures in this google document
<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1g4Q_XDVGEAbVR_7DLNIbDN2men57BQ0pNn8CyRc2od8/edit>.
Solutions could be code snippets, other projects, concepts, examples of web
pages, sequence plans etc. Every idea and example is welcome. If you know
which risk your solution is addressing you can post it in the corresponding
section. Otherwise you can post it in the chapter ?Miscellaneous?.



And once again, thank you for the great progress we made this year and we
are looking forward to your contribution in 2015 as well.



Until then, happy holidays!



Stefan & Florian

Can you please unsubscribe me from the list? It seems that there is not much viable input except self-congratulations.

Thanks!

Hello Alexander

I believe you can self-unsubscribe at
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp_top_10_privacy_risks_project
- but if not I'm sure the project leaders will do it for you.

Perhaps there hasn't been as much open sharing and discussion as there
should be, and a couple of months ago I asked (pestered) Stefan and
Florian to use this mailing list, instead of emailing individuals
directly. So I was pleased to see this message, and I think the new
Google document will be a great way to capture countermeasure ideas.

Sorry you want to leave,

best regards

Colin

Hi Ulysses,

Ideas should be collected until 15 February.
The elaboration of the countermeasures could already start parallel to the collection of ideas early next year.
Let?s see what the results of the brainstorming will be.

Happy holidays
Stefan
