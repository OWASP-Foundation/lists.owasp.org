	Countermeasures v1.0 published
Message-ID: <CAAMVF9XbZVhTBPSzpWDWcuNfgd4OOYkJg9-cXSRSA81PDZ1Q-g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am happy to announce that we *published the countermeasures for the OWASP
Top 10 Privacy Risks* today. In this document
<https://www.owasp.org/images/0/0a/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Countermeasures_v1.0.pdf>
you can find many best practices and hints how to improve web application
privacy.

Thank you for all of you that provided valuable content.

If someone of you is willing to *help to set up a structure on the project
page *to provide the content of the new document in HTML with a
similar look and feel like the classical OWASP Top 10 project
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A1-Injection>, let me know.

By the way, I will present some of the countermeasures at the IAPP Privacy
Intensive in London on 20 April in the session "How to boost web
application privacy". Maybe I see you there.

Best regards,
Florian
