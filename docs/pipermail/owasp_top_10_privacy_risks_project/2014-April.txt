Dear members of the OWASP Top 10 Privacy Project,

First of all, thank you for contributing to our project.
Our membership list has now 76 volunteers with technical, organizational and legal backgrounds and different experiences with privacy.
That is a great feedback and shows the importance of this project.

As a platform for discussions we will use google docs. We will grant access for this document to all of you today.
Here is the link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nHM9LH2rP6ac3DvJ7lehDNb9qVP5YADOQGNEuiy5okg/
After several weeks of brainstorming and analysis of similar projects we developed an approach for this project together with the University of Applied Sciences Munich which is posted in this document.

Thus, a first working package is ready for discussion.
Now we need to define our privacy targets and the threat models we use to identify threats.
Drafts for this will be added to the google document soon. Feel free to participate in this discussion.

A questionnaire to determine the frequency of privacy threats in web applications will be provided later on. We will keep you up-to-date via the project website<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project> and by mail.

Thank you very much for your contribution.


Best regards,
