Hey, Dimitri and Filipe, I too am interested! I've sent an email to the two people listed as leaders on the owasp website (sent to their owasp.org email addies), to alert them to this conversation and check if they are still the correct contacts. If I don't hear anything, I will ask Matt Tesauro what to do, unless someone else has a better idea. ~ Ann
