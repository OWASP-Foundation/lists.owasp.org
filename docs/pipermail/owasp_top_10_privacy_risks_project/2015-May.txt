Subject: [Owasp_top_10_privacy_risks_project] OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks -
	Participate in describing countermeasures
Message-ID: <CAAMVF9UQh9=XAnCJm1N4wxoLkrmAcy7OVrR3nmwwHYWpSqGuLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi privacy fans,

I just created a template/draft for the description of countermeasures
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GaoJDPtyXMv09wIw9xXTVPYTR_6fQROlptszPhxVc1s/edit?usp=sharing>
for
the OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks. We already got quite some input during
brainstorming
for countermeasures
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g4Q_XDVGEAbVR_7DLNIbDN2men57BQ0pNn8CyRc2od8/edit?usp=sharing>
and now it would be nice to have some volunteers picking one (or more) of
the Top 10 risks and detailing the description with references etc.

Let us know if you want to help and we will grant you write access to the
document.

Do not hesitate to ask questions and not everything has to be perfect from
the beginning. We will have some reviews later on.

We appreciate your input!

Best regards,
Florian
