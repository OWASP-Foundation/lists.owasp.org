Subject: [Owasp_top_10_privacy_risks_project] Looking for public guidance on
 how to delete personal data for the OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks Project
Message-ID: <CAAMVF9Udpdr-vGRT_iDKLf2R8G8KKgN2pm2JjJZLXrUxqEOwLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

is anyone aware of a publically available template / guidance on how to
delete personal data appropriately? We would like to mention it as an
example in the countermeasures document
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GaoJDPtyXMv09wIw9xXTVPYTR_6fQROlptszPhxVc1s/edit>
for
the risk P4 Insufficient Data Deletion.

Thank you in advance and best regards,
Florian
