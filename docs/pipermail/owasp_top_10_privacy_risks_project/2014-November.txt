Florian

Congratulation on the recent activities.

Thank you for the additional explanation about P6.

P9/P10
======

But I was also wondering about P9 and P10:

   P9   - Missing or insufficient Session Expiration
   P10 - Insecure Data Transfer

Aren't these already part of "P1 - Web Application Vulnerabilities"
which is described as "his risk also encompasses the OWASP Top 10 List
of web application vulnerabilities and the risks resulting from
them.".  If not, how are P9 and P10 different please?


Project Name/Label
===============

This is web application privacy risks. Could there be a mobile app
version too? I wonder if it is different?


Use of OWASP Mailing List
=====================

CCing this to the project mailing list, as the original message wasn't
sent there.

Also, I asked a question on the mailing list in August:

   http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp_top_10_privacy_risks_project/2014-August/000002.html

It was never replied to. I don't mind being ignored ;-) but wondered
is there some other place we are meant to contribute and share (e.g.
ZAP uses a Google Group)?  If so, can you set an auto-responder on the
OWASP mailing list to say it is not used please.


Regards

Colin

Dear Colin,

I will took the privilege and answer some of the  concerns.

Privacy problems are often interwinded.

P9 is slightly different from P1. P1 refers to insecurity and is more general. However, P9 allows the collection (aggregation) of user data for a potential later use and is not strictly related to security. My understanding is that in a survey, people addressed some past media coverage of these kind of problems. I respect the opinion from the survey, although I am not fully sure if having this particular problem as a separate number on the list is truly justified. That said, it's good we have at least some "mediums" ;)

That said, I extensively discussed overlaps with Florian, as there appear to be some more evident examples (e.g. P4 and P8 are somewhat redundant and could be simplified in one point, same for P10 and P1 ["insecurity"]). As said, we did discuss it with Florian and agreed that any changes at this point are possible, but in the next revision of the list (update). In this case I am looking forward to working on that.

Best,
Lukasz

Lukasz

Thank you, that has helped explain P9 further for me. "Session
expiration" made me think of a software weakness, but it sounds like
it is meant to be more related to "ongoing collection of information"
- beyond what is necessary.

Yes I see what you mean by P4 and P8 too. Classification is hard, and
it is good this list exists at all.

Thank you for your help,

Colin

I will be out of the office until November 10,  I will have infrequent
access to email and voicemail.  If you need immediate assistance and know
another Jones Day attorney working on the matter about which you are
emailing, please contact that person.  Otherwise, you can contact my

will try to direct you to someone who can assist you in my absence.
