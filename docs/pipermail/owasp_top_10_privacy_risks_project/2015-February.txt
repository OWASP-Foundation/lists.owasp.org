Dear project members,

This is the last week where we collect countermeasures for the risks identified.
We have already good suggestions, but we could use all of your ideas.
Solutions could be code snippets, other projects, concepts, examples of web pages, sequence plans etc. Every idea and example is welcome. If you know which risk your solution is addressing you can post it in the corresponding section. Otherwise you can post it in the chapter "Miscellaneous".

Please contribute until Monday in our brainstorming document<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1g4Q_XDVGEAbVR_7DLNIbDN2men57BQ0pNn8CyRc2od8/edit>:

Regards,
Stefan
