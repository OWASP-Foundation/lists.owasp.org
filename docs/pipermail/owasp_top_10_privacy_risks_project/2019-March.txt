Subject: [Owasp_top_10_privacy_risks_project] Mailing list migration -
	Action needed
Message-ID: <CAAMVF9Uv6yP0XOWe2oowreE2aaA56BgReec2rs_tzveD4g-5FA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

OWASP decided to migrate their mailing lists to Google because mailman is
no longer supported and more expensive to maintain. I hope that you will
continue to join the new Top 10 Privacy list by clicking the
following link:

https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/top-10-privacy-risks-project/join

In the meanwhile we started discussing the method for the project update in
2019 in the following document
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AlAg2cybvo5VX-frzF5uHeAcib3X2rTAA2p97XH8fHw/edit

Feel free to have a look at it and provide comments.

Best regards and have a nice weekend,
Florian
