Subject: [Owasp-belgium] OWASP @ FOSSDEM 2018 - 3 & 4 February
Message-ID: <CAM_xD8zdcV6WEOpobugBsFB4aAjw9uS_c4yoWZJN9zw9MYWWag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OWASP Belgium,

OWASP will have a booth at this years FOSSDEM edition!
Spyros and Antonis (see CC) volunteered to man the booth, coming over from
the UK.

Of course, two is never enough and we are looking for volunteers who can
support Spyros and Antonis both days or one of the two days. Please email
them if you are interested!

We need to get some booth material and OWASP goodies for the booth to
Belgium. Therefore we need someone who can print some of  the OWASP flyers
and who is willing to receive OWASP merchandise for the booth. Perfectly
someone who lives close to the venue or is volunteering for the booth on
Saturday, February 3rd.

Kind regards,
-martin

Hallo Martin, Spyros and Antonis!

I'm going to FOSDEM 2018 and I'd be happy to staff the OWASP booth at
times. I haven't finalized the list of talks I don't want to miss, but we
can work that out offline.

I live in Brussels and could receive some materials and bring them to the
venue. Let's talk logistics!

Looking forward to seeing you at FOSDEM this year!

Thomas

Hey Thomas!

This is great, thanks a lot for the offer!

Pass by anytime you can then :)

So far someone else has volunteered to receive materials but we will ask
if things change.

See you in FOSDEM!
