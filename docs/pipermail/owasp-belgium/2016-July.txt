Dear,

We are proud to announce the dates of the next edition of BeNeLux OWASP
Day! The event will take place on 24 (trainings) and 25 (conference)
November 2016, in Leuven - Belgium.

OWASP AppSec conferences are true security conferences with all talks and
presentations focusing on various areas of information security. Topics
should focus on the technical and social aspects of security, and should
not contain marketing or sales pitches.

We encourage and prioritize submissions covering research and new work
impacting:

?        secure development of web applications.

?        security testing of web applications.

?        security of DevOps processes, architectures, and tools.

?        security of applications designed for mobile devices.

?        security of Internet of Things devices and platforms.

?        Cloud platform security

?        Browser security

?        HTML5 security

?        OWASP tools or projects in practice

*Terms*

other non-branded template. Presentations may not use company-themed decks
or include a company logo except on the speaker bio slide. Failure to
observe these requirements will result in talk removal.

All presentation slides will be published on the conference website.
Pictures and other materials in presentations should not violate any
copyrights. Presentation submitters are solely liable for copyright
