Subject: Preliminary Announcement: 2006 European OWASP AppSec Conference
- May 30-31, 2006 near Brussels

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is proud to announce the 2006 European Application Security
Conference. This year's conference will be held May 30-31 at the
Catholic University of Leuven (aka Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or
K.U. Leuven) in Leuven, which is 25 km from Brussels. Please set these
dates aside on your calendar!

Along with this announcement of the conference we are doing our first
Call For Papers (See subsequent message).

AGENDA: This conference is expected to have dual tracks like last years
US conference. We are still identifying the speakers and agenda. The
current details on the conference are available on the OWASP website at
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html">http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html</A>

REGISTRATION DETAILS: Registration is not open yet but we expect the
conference fee to be 300 Euros for early registration and 350 Euros for
registrations after April 30, 2006.

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE - May 29, 2006: OWASP has
arranged to have a one-day hands on Web Application Security training
course the day prior to the conference. This one day class will be held
at a nearby facility and is only 600 Euros for conference attendees.

More details on this training course is available at: 
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/training.html">http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/training.html</A>

ADDITIONAL COURSES - May 29, 2006
OWASP is looking into offering additional training courses beyond the
one listed above. Additional topics being considered are Web Services
Security, .NET Security, and possibly others.

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - May 30, 2006: The traditional evening
dinner/social event is expected to be planned. Details TBD.
This event typically involves a dinner at a nearby hotel from 7-9 PM,
followed by drinks nearby.

If you know others that would be interested in attending the 2OWASP
conference, please forward them this email and let them know about this
opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you all
there!

Thanks, Dave
