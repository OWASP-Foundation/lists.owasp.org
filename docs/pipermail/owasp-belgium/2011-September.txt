Ofer,

I love the approach, I agree that jobs are of interest to the OWASP
membership - it is the head-hunters who turn things into a circus. I will be
interested to know how your approach works out. I will be particularly
interested to know if the direct advertising and no head hunters approach is
sufficient.

Cheers,
