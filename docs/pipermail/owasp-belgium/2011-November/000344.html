*David Rook*

David Rook is the Application Security Lead at Realex Payments in Dublin.
He is a contributor to several OWASP projects including the code review
guide and the Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet. He has presented at
leading information security conferences including DEF CON, BlackHat USA
and RSA Europe. In addition to his work with OWASP David created a security
resource website and blog called Security Ninja (
<A HREF="http://www.securityninja.co.uk&lt;http://owasp.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a99c172639b808e20fb155a53&amp;id=1f0b3e229c&amp;e=a234d03258">http://www.securityninja.co.uk&lt;http://owasp.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a99c172639b808e20fb155a53&amp;id=1f0b3e229c&amp;e=a234d03258</A>&gt;
).

In 2010 the Security Ninja blog was nominated for five awards including the
best technology blog at the Irish Blog Awards, the Computer Weekly IT
Security blog award and was a finalist for the Irish Web Awards Best
Technology Site. In 2011 David received a Developer Security MVP award from
Microsoft. David has recently become one of the first mentors in the
Information Security Mentors project helping young people progress their
information security careers.

*Abstract*

Agnitio: the security code review Swiss army knife

Teaching developers to write secure code, helping security professionals
find security flaws in source code, producing application security metrics
and reports with integrity checks and audit trails. If you want to
implement an SDLC that produces secure software with the audit trails and
reports frequently demanded by auditors and management you need to
acknowledge that these are key constituents and implement them in a form
that is both easy to understand and use.

This is far easier to talk about than it is to implement in the real world
where well structured SDLC&#8217;s are rare and application security programmes
are usually under funded. Working with developers, security professionals
and management to cultivate an environment where secure code is written and
flaws found consistently requires both time and money. The same can be said
for producing informative reports and metrics when all of your security
code review data resides in notepad, Word and Excel files. With these
problems in mind I developed Agnitio to be my security code review Swiss
army knife and released it as a free tool in late 2010.

In this demonstration filled talk I will show how Agnitio can be used to
addresses repeatability, integrity and audit trail concerns by requiring
the creation of application profiles, the use of a security code review
checklist consisting of over 80 application security questions and
mandatory integrity checks for reviews and reports created using the tool.
I will demonstrate how the inbuilt secure coding and security code review
guidance modules allow developers and security professionals to access the
information they need precisely when they need it. I will also show how
Agnitio automatically creates metrics and reports bringing much needed
visibility to the security code review process with no extra effort
required from the reviewer, developers or management.

Agnitio v2.1 will be demonstrated during this talk which will show how
Agnitio&#8217;s already powerful feature set has been expanded to guidance and
questions linked to the OWASP top 10 mobile risks as well as the ability to
decompile and analyse Android applications.

*Alex Thissen*

Alex Thissen is a principal architect at Achmea and concentrates on
integration-architecture and security. You can meet hem at various
conferences and seminars where he will share his experiences from the
field. He likes just about everything related to Microsoft products and
technologies, but tries to focus on building secure web-applications in
distributed enterprise environments.

*Abstract*

Implementing SDLC and lessons learned Paying attention to security during
application development is a must. Yet, often we find that security didn&#8217;t
get the attention it should have had. One of the ways to force yourself to
&#8220;think and act security&#8221; is to embed security in your development process.
The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a platform-agnostic
approach for applying security during the various stages of your
development process. In this session you will get an overview of the
Microsoft SDL and how it fits in &#8220;traditional&#8221; and agile projects. But,
with just an approach you are not done. This session will also show the
hurdles that Achmea encountered during the implementation of an SDL, and
what should be done to make an SDL successful. You will get to see the
lesson learned from the Microsoft Competence Centre at Achmea IT.
