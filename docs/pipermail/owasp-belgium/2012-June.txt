Hi,

Please remind me again what Owasp Belgium needs to achieve.

- If it is visibility to CISOs and their managers, fund the 1st, and include mobile specific controls.
Also touch on sw life cycle, which of course includes design, develop, test, deploy.
Make sure to include trade off issues like Return on Appsec.

- If it is to promote state of the art (/business proven?) prevention measures, either Proxy or Sensor will do.


- I'm not in favour of cheat sheets as these tend not to improve the maturity of the organisation deploying them.

Hi,

The mission of our Belgium chapter is
1) to achieve awareness to all SDL stakeholders (this includes CISO, but
also development, QA, procurement, ...)
2) to promote the usage of OWASP project deliverables
3) to involve the Belgium community in OWASPs mission and projects

Hello Leaders,

I am happy to say we have chosen 4 projects for the initial project reboot
initiative.
We have appointed an initial seed of $5,000 for each project.

*Projects in question are:*
*
*
OWASP Development Guide,
OWASP CISO Guide,
OWASP ZAP and
OWASP Mobile Project

Some projects may require more time and money, others less so.
The project proposals were reviewed and voted on by the named review team.
The results can be seen on the wiki (Link below).

Anyway's congratulations to the winning proposals.

Also a big thanks on behalf of the foundation to the chapters who pledged
