Subject: [Owasp-belgium] Event on code reviews
Message-ID: <D16B83B5-43C6-43B0-84C9-782C8D36045E@gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I hope you don't mind me using this channel to tell you about an  
event this Wednesday at the Information Systems Security  
Association's annual meeting. Please let me know if not appreciated  
(this one time).

ISSA has invited a Dutch company, Fortify, to come over and show us  
their way of  reviewing source code, with a focus on security in that  
code. We've heard that they obtain some spectacular results in far  
less time then many are used to.

You can find the details on http://www.issa-be.org/mambo/index.php? 
option=com_content&task=view&id=83&Itemid=9. I guessed that this  
would of particular interest to our OWASP members.

Koen

Subject: [Owasp-belgium] Belgium OWASP Board?
Message-ID: <20070307131028.F34D6D41A4@asia.telenet-ops.be>

Dear List Members,

This is a follow-up on my blog entry, a couple of weeks ago:
http://blogs.owasp.org/seba/2007/02/19/chapter-democrazy/.
 
To further develop the Belgian OWASP Chapter, I think it is a good idea to
broaden the leadership and create a Belgian OWASP Board. A great example of
how a group of people can boost a chapter is Italy
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Italy).

I would like to invite people interested in board participation to let me
know. I hope to organize a first board meeting prior to the next chapter
meeting in May.

If you have any questions and/or remarks, do not hesitate to contact me or -
even better - post it to the mailing list!

Kind regards,

Seba

Message-ID: <C840A806BF100245B61F70F24C28C233954BB6@CASTOR.office.ascure.com>

Hi,

I have uploaded the presentation on
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Intro_and_Top_10_2007.zip
The RC2 of the Top 10 is expected next week; one of the biggest changes
is a lot more detail on how automatable the finding is and there were
some significant re-wordings, but no heading changes, no major control
changes.

Regards,

Seba
