===================================

SecAppDev 2009 will take place from March 2nd to 6th in Groot
Begijnhof, Leuven. SecAppDev is an annual course on secure application
development coordinated by secappdev.org, a non-profit organization
set up to increase security awareness and skills in the development
community. secappdev.org partners with K.U. Leuven and Solvay Brussels
School of Economics and Management.

The course is aimed at professional software architects, designers,
developers, testers and technical project managers.

The star-studded SecAppDev 2009 faculty include
- Gary McGraw, CTO of Cigital, prolific author and software security agitator,
- D. J. Bernstein, the author of qmail and djbdns, the only DNS server
invulnerable to the Kaminsky bug,
- Bart Preneel, the head of COSIC, the renowned crypto lab,
- Ken van Wyk, the first employee at the CERT Coordination Center and
widely-acclaimed lecturer,
- Jacob West leads the Fortify software security research group,
- Frank Piessens pioneered teaching application security at university.

If you cannot make it for the course, there is another highly
recommended opportunity to see Gary McGraw in action during the OWASP
chapter meeting in Leuven on March 4th - a separate announcement
follows.

Paid-up OWASP members receive a 10% discount, public servants 50%. Do
not delay registration to avoid disappointment.

Dear Seba,

I will not be available for the meeting on March 4 as I will be in
Mexico for the ICANN meetings.
Security, especially on the web, attracts our attention, reason why I
certainly try to participate at a following meeting, if this fits in my
schedule.
Please let me know when next meeting will take place.

Best regards,

Rudi Vansnick
