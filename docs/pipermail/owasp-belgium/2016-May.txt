Dear all,

At the Design & Technology department of Erasmus University College Brussels, we are currently offering a position for research assistant. This is full-time position for 1 year, with possibility for extension after positive evaluation.

Innoviris approved the research project "SeCloud Security-driven Engineering of Cloud-based applications", which focuses on the development and promotion of secure cloud applications. The project fits into the broader context of Secur-IT (http://www.securit-brussels.be/) in which four other security-related projects were launched. SeCloud, with a total budget of more than four million euro, brings together a number of research partners from several educational and innovation companies: Sirris, VUB, UCL, ULB and Erasmus University College Brussels join their forces in this ambitious research project.

We are looking for a full-time research assistant in the field of software security. For the complete official vacancy in Dutch, see https://www.erasmushogeschool.be/over-ehb/vacatures/externe-vacature-wetenschappelijk-medewerker-1

We have an English translation available: https://mobilewearable.ehb.be/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/External_vacancy_scientific_researcher-.pdf

The  Agenda
???????????

18h00 - 19h00: Welcome drink & food

19h00 - 19h10: Introduction

19h10 - 19h40: The current state of access management by Thomas Heyman

Security challenges are arising as businesses become more and more digital.
Integrating access control into all your business process requires proper access management.
In this talk, we will give and overview of the current state-of-practice of access management. Who are the world?s leading vendors in access management? What is the role of different access management technologies like identity management and identity governance & administration and how do they relate to each other? What does it take for your organisation to effectively manage access to mitigate future ?digital risks??

19h40 - 20h00: Attribute-based access models for managing access control by Maarten Decat

Attribute-Based access control (ABAC) is the current state-of-practice model to express access rules in terms of attributes of subjects, resources, actions and the environment. In industry, ABAC is becoming the general methodology for managing access in IT applications.
In the first part of this talk, we will go into detail on how attributes can express different access control concepts.
In the second part of the talk, we will discuss how ABAC is used as a model for access control management to align access rules with business processes via a wide variety of domain-specific access control concepts.

20h00 - 20h20: Break

20h20 - 20h40: Policy-based Access Control in practice by Willem De Groef

Externalising or modularising access rules outside of the application in so called policies, represents a fundamental software software engineering tactic. In this talk, we will discuss ways how application developers can decouple access control rules from the application code and how this is done in current technologies.
We will also talk about the ways a security expert can express access control policies in an independent format and how he can manage these policies to align them with for example rules from different departments or enterprise-wide regulations.

20h40 - 21h00: Keynote by Bart De Win

21h00 - 21h15: Q&A

21h15: Networking drink
