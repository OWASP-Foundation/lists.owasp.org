"Cross-Site Request Forgery (aka CSRF or XSRF) is a dangerous
vulnerability present in just about every website. An issue so pervasion
and fundamental to the way the Web is designed to function we've had a
difficult time even reporting it as a "vulnerability". Which is also a
main reason why CSRF does not appear on the Web Security Threat
Classification or the OWASP Top 10. Times are changing and it's only a
matter of time before CSRF hacks its way into the mainstream
consciousness." 
(Ed: We're revising the Top 10 for 2007 - feel free to come join us!)

fyi: CSRF is also known as "session riding".

Subject: OWASP Testing Guide v2: let's start! (Call for participation)

To: webappsec at lists.owasp.org, webappsec at securityfocus.com,
websecurity at webappsec.org

 

 

Hi all,

the new OWASP Testing Project is started!

 

We want to review the old OWASP Testing Project and create the OWASP
Testing Guide v2 by the end of the year.

 

The Testing guide originated in 2003. Dan Cuthbert was one of the
original editors. It was handed over to Eoin Keary in 2005 and
transformed into a wiki. Being a wiki it is easier for more to
contribute and should keep up-to-date easier. Matteo Meucci has decided
to take on the Testing guide (which is not a trivial feat) and update
it.

 

Problem to be Addressed:

Many additional sections should be updated and reviewed. Also additional
areas of  discovery should be addressed. the guide currently covers alot
but could cover much more.

 

Benefit to OWASP Members and Community:

A reference to the testing community that is updated by the community.

Should provide many of the answers one would look for when testing an
application for security.

 

Goals and Deliverables:

The guide to be updated with a defined list pf topics and the current
guide reviewed. the list of additional topics has been agreed with the
AoC.

A revised and updated Testing Guide which shall be more extensive than
ever before.

 

**************************** Phase I: Call for participation

*****************************************

Work is underway on the 1st phase of the testing guide v2, and we would
love to hear from volunteers who could offer their knowledge in creating
this phase. If you have knowledge and experience in application testing,
and can spare a few hours a week, please contact me and subscribe to our
ml.

 

Firstly we have to discuss about the new index of the guide (deadline
15th October):

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Tes
ting_Guide_-_Index

 

Then write down the new paragraphs. We would like to collect the first
documentations by 5th November.
