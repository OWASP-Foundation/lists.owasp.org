Message-ID: <C840A806BF100245B61F70F24C28C23350CB57@CASTOR.office.ascure.com>

Dear  List Member ,

 

First I would like to remind you of the 2nd European OWASP Conference on
30-31 of May.

Do not miss this unique opportunity. Not only is it hosted in Belgium by
KULeuven, but it

provides an agenda loaded with very interesting web application security
topics!

For details and registration, visit
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html

 

Second, I invite you to the next OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting!

 

WHAT
The Open Web Application Security Project (www.owasp.org
<http://www.owasp.org/> ) Belgian Chapter organizes their next Chapter
meeting.

OWASP's all-volunteer participants produce free, professional quality,
open-source documentation, tools, and standards on application security.


An example of this is the famous OWASP top ten of most critical web
application security flaws. 

The OWASP community facilitates conferences, local chapters, articles,
and message forums.

Participation in OWASP is free and open to all, as are all the materials
we produce.

 

WHEN
Monday 8th of May 2006, 18h30 - 20h30.

 

Already mark your agenda's for the next chapter meetings this year:

*          Thursday Sep 14th 2006 - Antwerp

*          Tuesday Nov 21 2006 - Brussels

Timing 18h-21h, updates on http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html

 

WHERE

Deloitte <http://www.deloitte.be/>  sponsors the venue, drinks and
snacks:

Location: Deloite Diegem, route can be found online
<http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/cda/doc/content/RouteDescriptionDiegem.pdf>
. 

 

 

PROGRAM

*	18h00 - 18h30: Welcome, get drink & snack 
*	18h30 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, Ascure 
	    OWASP Update 
*	18h45 - 19h15: Hillar Leoste, Zone-H
	   2005 Internet Attack Statistics for Belgium 

Presentation + Discussion

Zone-h maintains the largest archive of information about attacks
against 

Internet web servers. Every day the Zone-H volunteers receive an average


of 2,500 notifications related to web server intrusions.

Hillar will filter out the 2005 statistics for Belgium.

I am sure this will provide an interesting topic to discuss about!

*	19h15 - 20h30: Johan Peeters, Program Director secappdev.org 

   Can "Agile" Development Produce Secure Applications?

Presentation + Discussion

Received wisdom has it that secure development and agile processes do 

not mix. Is that really so? Agile practices have proven in many 

projects to yield applications with fewer functional defects. Can they 

also be put to work to reduce the number of security vulnerabilities?

 

WHO should attend

Anyone interested in Web Application Security (management, security
professionals, developers, students, etc).

OWASP Belgium chapter membership is free. All meetings are free. 

There are never vendor pitches or sales presentations at OWASP meetings.

Check our chapter page http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html
<http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html>  on meeting details, sign up
to the chapter mailing list and introduce yourself.

 

Please drop a mail to sdl at ascure.com if you plan to attend, 

so we can size the venue appropriately and keep you updated on
last-minute changes.

 

Please forward to anyone you feel would have an interest in these
events.

 

Thank you,

Hi

As i said in the presentation that defacers are using google and
infosec mailnglists to find new targets, they also seem to have they
own security researchers. Her is the fresh example:

alp_eren at ayyildiz.org  sent email to bugtrack about vulnerability in
the plaNetStat (admin page is not protected). At the end of the email
he sends greetz to: Thehacker,iskorpitx,shadow,suskun, and all AYT
member. All names mentioned here are defacer groups/defacers ...

Triad meets the Legal Triad

Dear ISSA-BE Member,
Dear Security Professional, 

The ISSA Brussels-European Chapter is proud to announce its next
Security Event entitled:

"Where the Security Triad meets the Legal Triad." 

This event is not to be considered like a clash between Chinese gangs
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triads
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triads> ) but rather like a marriage of
understanding with complementary partners, as we'll see : 

The Legal Triad of Law, Regulation and Contracts can fit seamlessly with
the Security Triad of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. In
the first presentation this will be explained in general whereas the
second presentation will address one specific subtopic, software escrow.


This evening event will be held 

 

on Wednesday May 17th, 2006 

 

Agenda :

1800h : Welcome 

1830h : "The Security Triad and corresponding laws / regulations /
contracts"  by Jan Leysen, partner at the Leysen-Vandelanotte-Devloo
Lawoffice

1930h : short break 

1945h : ""Escrow": Legal and Technical aspects" by Maurice Gruyaert,
Managing Director Escrow Europe NV

2045h : closing drink 

This event will be held in the Offices of Ubizen, Philipssite 5, B-3001
Leuven. 

A detailed roadmap and driving instructions can be found on 
http://www.ubizen.com/c_about_us/1_company/_itineraries/ubizen_hqemea.pd
f
<http://www.ubizen.com/c_about_us/1_company/_itineraries/ubizen_hqemea.p
df>  

Registration for the event is free but mandatory. In case there would be
more registrations than available seats, ISSA members in good standing
and trial members will be favoured over other people in a ratio of 70%
(trial-)members to 30% non-members. Early registrants will have
precedence over late registrants. ISSA Members can register through
logging in to www.issa-be.org <http://www.issa-be.org/>  . Non-members
can register by e-mailing their contact details to register at issa-be.org
<http://uk.f250.mail.yahoo.com/ym/Compose?To=Tomas.Vanhoof at issa-be.org>
mentioning "ISSA Security Event Registration" in the subject line. 

Free trial memberships can be set up through 
http://www.issa.org/join.html <http://www.issa.org/join.html>  - don't
forget to choose "Brussels European" as Chapter Affiliation! 

SPEAKERS' BIO'S AND ABSTRACTS OF THE PRESENTATIONS :

Jan Leysen

Jan Leysen is lawyer in Kortrijk since 1986. Mediator in Commercial Law
since 2004. Partner LEYSEN-VANDELANOTTE-DEVLOO LAWOFFICE KORTRIJK.
Suppliant Judge High Court Kortrijk. 

He co-authored 2 books on IT: 'Informatiseren in de KMO: managements- en
juridische aspecten' (Mys & Breesch, 2000) and 'Informatiebeveiliging
binnen locale besturen' (V-ICT-OR, 2005). 

abstract : 

For every part of the Security Triad there is a corresponding part with
regards to the Law, Regulations and Contracts, which are the
cornerstones of the legal profession.
This presentation will give you another view on IT & IT Security than
the one you're oh so familiar with. 

Maurice Gruyaert

Ir. Maurice Gruyaert is Managing Director of Escrow Europe NV. 

Maurice has been working in the ICT market for more than 30 years.
Before joining Escrow Europe NV he worked for companies like
Siemens-Nixdorf, Digital Equipment (Compaq, HP), Xerox,
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, De Federale Verzekeringen,...  

He has engineering degrees in Electronics, Nuclear Physics and
Electro-Mechanics 

abstract : 

Many organisations are dependant in their day-to-day activities on third
party technology. Dependency implies RISK. It is crucial for technology
users to minimize their expose to risks. An escrow arrangement is the
common and effective tool to protect the interest of all parties: the
technology owner and their end users.  

In the presentation of Maurice the following subjects will be covered: 

*	What is escrow? 
*	Different kinds of escrow? 
*	User's standpoint? 
*	Supplier's standpoint? 
*	What is a balanced escrow agreement? 
*	How to verify the deposit (different levels of verification)? 
*	What about documentation? 
*	What about updates? 
*	How to use the deposit when it is released?

We hope to see you on this very interesting security event! 

High Regards 
Tomas Vanhoof 
2006 Education & General Events Officer of the ISSA Brussels-European
Chapter

Sorry about that.

I enjoyed the discussion on agile development very much. Thanks to 
everyone present. I briefly reported on it on my blog on 
http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp. You are welcome to comment.

For those who want to delve deeper into the issue of producing secure 
applications in an agile way, you may be interested in a paper I 
presented at the Symposium on Requirements Engineering for Information 
Security 2005. It is available on my web site: 
http://johanpeeters.com/papers.html.

I am always eager to get further feedback and carry on the discussion.

Subject: [WEB SECURITY] Application Security Hacking Videos

With college campuses being hacked into on a seemingly daily basis, and
student information being stolen and used for Identity Theft; I thought you
might like to see how the hacks are being done, and how astoundingly easy
they are.  I have produced a video of a security audit I performed on a
local college website that shows how easy these exploits are.  There is also
a brief training on the homepage that introduces non-experts to SQL
injection concepts in a fashion that makes it easy to understand.

 

Below is the link to the video of me hacking into the college web site using
SQL injection:
http://www.appiant.net/exploit.wmv 
 
Other videos related to application security can be viewed from the home
page as well: www.appiant.net <http://www.appiant.net/>  
 
It's not available from the web page, but if you want to see the video of
Microsoft's response to application security by securing the database:
http://www.appiant.net/sql_security.wmv 
 
No, that video is not a fake; the entire video can be accessed from
Microsoft's website - the original is over an hour long, I just edited it
down to ~5 minutes so you could get the point in a shorter timeframe.

Any questions, feel free to ask.
