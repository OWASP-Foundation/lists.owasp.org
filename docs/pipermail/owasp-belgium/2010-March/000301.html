Vulnerability:* Insecure Direct Object Reference is when a web application
exposes an internal implementation object to the user. Some examples of
internal implementation objects are database records, URLs, or files.
*Attack:* An attacker can modify the internal implementation object in an
attempt to abuse the access controls on this object. When the attacker does
this they may have the ability to access functionality that the developer
didn&#8217;t intend to expose access to.
*Countermeasure:* Reference should be validated for authorization and
accessed through reference maps. How this should be done will be shown.

*See the flyer attached! Registration via email to: <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-belgium">netherlands at owasp.org</A>*

Looking forward welcome Thursday!
