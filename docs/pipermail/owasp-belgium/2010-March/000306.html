<PRE>Hi,

Hacking&quot; in Diegem and is looking for people to participate. OWASP contacts
get a 10% discount by using the &quot;SecOrg&quot; code. Details below.

regards

Seba

security awareness and knowlegde. Let us know if you want to receive notice
of similar events?

Dear Sir/Madam

Togheter with the SANS Institute, I will be organizing the SEC560: Network
Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking course in mentor style in Brussels.
The course will be held at Ernst &amp; Young's premises in Diegem, each tuesday
from 18.00 until 21.00 starting on April 20th and ending on June 22th. The
SANS mentor program is designed to guide the students through the course
content in ten consecutive sessions, where in each lessen the mentor will
walk through the difficult sections of the course, provide hands-on
excerises and experience, and if there is some time left, demo some
cutting-edge penetration testing techniques. This style is perfect for
students who can not spend a whole week at one of the SANS conference in
Europe but who can dedicate some time for preparing the class through
self-study. All students will receive the official SEC560 course books from
SANS and access to MP3 recordings of the official SANS class.

If you know anyone of our colleagues or professional contacts who could be
interested, please feel free to forward this email. More information on the
course can be found here below:
*
Course Content*
Successful penetration testers don't just throw a bunch of hacks against an
organization and regurgitate the output of their tools. Instead, they need
to understand how these tools work indepth, and conduct their test in a
careful, professional manner. This course explains the inner workings of
numerous tools and their use in effective network penetration testing and
ethical hacking projects. More information on the SANS SEC 560 course can be
found at *<A HREF="http://www.sans.org/security-training/description.php?tid=1717*&lt;http://www.sans.org/security-training/description.php?tid=1717">http://www.sans.org/security-training/description.php?tid=1717*&lt;http://www.sans.org/security-training/description.php?tid=1717</A>&gt;
.

The SANS Mentor program is a self-study learning experience. Students will
work independently at their own pace, and are expected to read the course
books and any study materials provided -- prior to attending the Mentor-led
sessions.
*
Mentor Biography*
Erik has been working for Ernst &amp; Young&#8217;s Financial Service organisation for
the last two years, under supervision of Pieter Danhieux, who is one of
SANS's official instructors in Europe for the SEC560 course. Erik is
dedicated to IT Security projects, including  network and web application
penetration testing for large financial institutions. In order to keep his
knowledge at the cutting-edge, he travels around Europe attending hacking
courses and conferences such as SANS, BruCON, CCC and Hacking at Random. He
is also one of the main developers of The Hex Factor hacking challenge,
which runs each year on conferences such as BruCON in Belgium and SANS
London.
