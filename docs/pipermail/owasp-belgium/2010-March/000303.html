the honor of welcoming Chris Hoff, Director, Cloud &amp; Virtualization
Solutions at Cisco Systems and Technical Advisor &amp; Founding Member of the
Cloud Security Alliance.

In IT and Information Security, the 140-dB-&quot;buzz&quot; words are Cloud Computing
and Cloud Security.  Chris Hoff is a globally recognized expert and leading
thinker on Cloud Security and I can't think of anyone better suited to
explain us how to tackle Cloud Security than him! This is your chance to get
top-notch information and guidance and to ask questions not many other
people can answer!

*Title:*
The Frogs Who Desired A King: A Virtualization and Cloud Computing Security
Fable Set To Interpretive Dance

*Description:*
Aesop wrote a little ditty about some discontented frogs who lived in a
pond. They asked Zeus for a new King. They got one. It ate them. The moral
of this story is &quot;be careful what you wish for as you might just get it.&quot;

The corresponding analog is that of virtualization and cloud security. It's
coming, but it's not going to look much like what security looks like today
and it's certainly not what people are expecting.

On the one hand, it may consume us all because we're unprepared for what
we're asking for whilst on the other hand it's a platform change we'll adapt
to without much fuss.

We'll discuss the realities of both virtualization and Cloud Computing
security and how to deal with the things that don't change and also the
things that do profoundly.

*Bio *:

Chris is Director of Cloud &amp; Virtualization Solutions at Cisco Systems where
he focuses on virtualization and cloud computing security, spending most of
his time interacting with global enterprises and service providers,
governments, and the defense and intelligence communities.

Previously, he was Unisys Corporation's Chief Security Architect, served as
Crossbeam Systems' chief security strategist, was the CISO and director of
enterprise security at WesCorp, a $25 billion financial services company and
was founder/CTO of a national security consultancy.
Chris specializes in emerging and disruptive innovation and what it means to
security, and is technical advisor to the Cloud Security Alliance. Chris
blogs at <A HREF="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog">http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog</A>

*Some other interesting info about him :*

- Winner of the 2010 RSA Security Bloggers Awards in the category of &#8220;Most
Entertaining blog&#8221; (entertaining AND content-rich AND thought-provoking -
just check it out yourself at
<A HREF="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?tag=cloud-security">http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?tag=cloud-security</A> )
- he is probably the only Director of a multinational organization that has
more and bigger tattoos than the above-average rockstar (except maybe
organized crime, now that I think of it)
- he is one of the people that are defining our industry
