<PRE>Hi,

OWASP will have a booth at the Infosecurity.be 2010 event.
If you plan to come and have a couple of hours to help us man the
booth: contact <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-belgium">seba at owasp.org.</A>

If you are around: visit us and have a chat!

See you there,

Seba &amp; OWASP BE board

Below is the invitation for Infosecurity.be 2010
================================================================================================

Trade show Infosecurity.be, 24 &amp; 25 March Brussels Expo, offers IT
professionals an overview of the latest security technologies,
products and services. With a wide range of exhibitors, keynote
sessions, comprehensive seminar programme and other activities the
show offers a great deal of inspiration for all your security issues.

Keynote speakers
The seminars are divided into management sessions and technical
sessions. Seminars by keynote speakers are: &#8216;Data Security Breaches:
An Unstoppable Epidemic?&#8217; by Eugene Schultz (Emagined Security), &#8216;Data
Leakage Prevention: When data goes up and out&#8217; by No&#235;l van den
Driessche (KBC Group) and &#8216;Threat Landscape 2010: Evolution or
Revolution?&#8217; by Maksym Schipka (Kaspersky Lab). Schipka is a
widely-known security expert and one of the issues that he will
highlight is the need for a common understanding that organisations
have to focus a lot more on prevention when it comes to data security.
Schipka: &#8220;When you approach data security in a proactive way then
eventually money will be saved and data will be secured.&#8221;

Professional Development Caf&#233;
One of the keynote activities is the Professional Development Caf&#233;.
Infosecurity.be and (ISC)2 invite visitors to round table discussions
and small groups discussions on professional development. Each 40
minute session will offer practical insight and current research into
changing demands on the profession and the skills required to meet
them.

Infosecurity.be will also have some fascinating Case Studies, where
exhibitors show their solutions to your security problems. The show
takes place at the same time as the trade show Storage Expo BE (data
storage and management). A unique one-stop shopping opportunity: with
just one visit, you can kill two birds with one stone!

Data:
Wednesday 24th en Thursday 25th of March 2010

Opening Hours:
&gt;<i>From 10.00 A.M. to 5.00 P.M. Extra opening night on Wednesday till 7.00 P.M.
</I>
Location:
BRUSSELS Expo, Heizel
