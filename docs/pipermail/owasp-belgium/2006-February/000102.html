<PRE>The Insecure Magazines is great; I was totally unaware of it. Well 
written articles and lots of practical information.  Hard to believe it 
is free.

Another good resource that I enjoy is the weekly SANS NewsBites digest 
email:
<A HREF="https://www.sans.org/newsletters/">https://www.sans.org/newsletters/</A>

I've include a sample one from today at the bottom of this email.


Another great resource, also by email, is Bruce Schneier's monthly 
CRYPTO-GRAM.  Always an enlightened read.

The CME-24 worm is really as bad as the news stories make it out to be.
SANS Internet Storm Center has records of more than 300,000 victims.  If
their ISPs don't let them know about the problem they will lose most of
their key files.  This may be a good chance to see whether the courts
will find ISPs and other network owners liable for not protecting their
customers when they knew in advance that the customers' data was at
risk.

  --UK ISP Notifying Users Who May be Infected by CME 24 (Blackmal, 
Nyxem, etc.)
(30/27 January 2006)
UK Internet Service Provider (ISP) Easynet is notifying customers whose
computers may be infected by the CME-24 worm.  CME-24 makes infected
computers visit an online counter; the ISP is monitoring the counter
traffic and sending warnings to users whose computers visit the counter
website.  CME-24 carries a malicious payload; on February 3, it is
programmed to destroy files on infected PCs.

(Honan): Credit must be given to Easynet for this move.  The
online community would be more secure if more ISPs took similar
proactive measures to notify users of viral infections.
(Paller): This is a great opportunity to establish a financial liability
precedent for negligence by ISPs and system owners. The ISPs have
several days to inform and protect their customers as does every other
large network owner such as government agencies, academic institutions
and large companies. If you learn of anyone who is damaged by this worm,
please connect them with me (<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-belgium">paller at sans.org</A>) and we will work together
to make sure that ISPs and network owners who are in a position to
protect their users understand that not providing such protection will
be considered negligence and carry penalties.]

  --Credit Card Details Allegedly Stolen from RI State Government Site
(27 January 2006)
A Rhode Island government web site, www.RI.gov, was reportedly the
target of cyber thieves, who stole credit card information belonging to
people who had conducted online business with Rhode Island state
agencies.  Cyber criminals bragged of their exploits several weeks ago
on a Russian-language web site.  Attackers breached the security of a
server database and stole encrypted credit card data.  A spokesperson
for the web site said they comply with the payment card Industry's Data
Security Standards, meaning they do not store complete credit card
information.  The breach was discovered through routine security
procedures; measures have been taken to close the hole the thieves
exploited.

[Editor's Note (Boeckman):  While it is important to go after the
criminals responsible for these acts, it is also important to hold the
decision makers in Government and business accountable for practicing
such poor risk management.
(Paller): This story doesn't make sense. Either easily unencrypted
credit card numbers were stolen and the PCI standard failed in this
case, or the PCI standard was OK and the criminals are lying.  To
maintain the credibility of the PCI standard (drafted primarily by
VISA), this issue of possible PCI failure needs to be clarified so it
can be corrected right away, if necessary.  I hope the VISA people will
write to us to resolve this. If they do we'll share the resolution in
the next issue.]

  --Spammer Fined US$5 Million
(26 January 2006)
A federal judge has ordered Christopher William Smith to pay America
Online (AOL) more than US$5 million in damages and legal fees for
sending billions of spam messages.  AOL filed a lawsuit against Smith
in 2004 under the CAN-SPAM Act.  Smith is also awaiting trial on
criminal charges of violating federal drug laws.

  --Man Gets Two Years in Prison for Selling Windows Source Code
(27 January 2006)
William Genovese Jr. has been sentenced to two years in prison for
selling source code for Windows 4.0 and 2000.  Genovese pleaded guilty
last year to one count of unlawful distribution of trade secrets.

computer-related crime. Following completion of his prison term Genovese
will serve three years of supervised release and will have programs
installed on his computer to monitor his Internet activity.

  --Japanese Police Arrest Man on Spyware Charges
(27 January 2006)
Police in Japan have arrested Atsushi Takewaka, who is suspected of
developing spyware that he and an alleged co-conspirator used to steal
Internet banking passwords.  Takewaka allegedly developed the spyware
at the request of Kiichi Hirayama, who sent CD-ROMs to targeted
companies that installed the spyware on their computers.  Takewaka and
Kiichi Hirayama allegedly used the stolen passwords to withdraw money
from bank accounts. The pair is also believed to be responsible for the
theft of an online banking password belonging to a Kawasaki, Japan
jewelry store.

  --Alleged AOL Phisher Arrested
(27/26 January 2006)
The US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles has announced the arrest of
Jeffrey Brett Goodin, who allegedly used a phishing scheme to trick
America Online (AOL) users into divulging their credit card details.
The phony email messages asked AOL users to update their billing
information and directed them to fraudulently constructed sites where
the financial data were harvested.  Goodin then used the information he
stole to make fraudulent charges on credit and debit cards.  Goodin
faces charges of wire fraud and unauthorized use of an access device.
If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in federal prison.

HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS SECURITY
  --DHS Will Restrict Access to Critical Infrastructure Database
(24 January 2006)
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says it will take precautions
to guard the security of critical infrastructure data submitted to the
National Asset Database.  All requests to view the database will be
reviewed and access will be permitted on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis.

[Editor's Note (Pescatore): As Ben Franklin said via Poor Richard's
Almanac: &quot;There's many a slip twixt the cup and the lips.&quot; Enforcing

POLICY &amp; LEGISLATION
  --Proposed Legislation Aimed at Fighting the Sale of Wireless Customer
     Phone Records
(30/27 January 2006)
US Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has proposed legislation that would
criminalize social engineering.  Under the proposed Consumer Telephone
Records Protection Act of 2006, which has bi-partisan support, people
who make false statements and provide false documentation to obtain
subscriber phone records as well as the people who disclose that
information to the data thieves could face legal action, as could those
who access a subscriber's account over the Internet without
authorization.  In a related story, Sprint Nextel has filed two lawsuits
against companies it alleges are selling confidential customer call
records and data.  Cingular Wireless, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile have
filed similar lawsuits.
<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/27/schumer_phone_records/print.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/27/schumer_phone_records/print.html</A>

[Editor's Note (Pescatore) This type of legislation always feels good
but runs into practical problems. Abused spouses, lawyers, private
detectives, skip tracers, etc - all tend to have some legitimate need
to obtain information using techniques that are basically social
engineering. Much the way the Digital Millennium Copyright Act is used
to impact legitimate actions, this type of legislation needs to be
thought through.]

COPYRIGHT, PIRACY &amp; DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
  --ISPs Ordered to Divulge Identities of Alleged File Sharers
(30 January 2006)
The British High Court has ordered ten Internet service providers (ISPs)
to provide the names, addresses and other personal details of 150
alleged illegal file sharers in the UK to the Federation Against
Software Theft.

  --Canadian Record Label Will Fund Family's Defense in File Sharing
(27 January 2006)
Nettwerk Music Group, Canada's largest record label, says it will fund
the defense of David Gruebel, who was sued by the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) for allegedly having music on his family
computer that was downloaded in violation of copyright law.  Nettwerk
chief executive terry McBride said &quot;The current actions of the RIAA are
not in my artists' best interests.  Litigation is a deterrent to
creativity ... and it is hurting the business I love.&quot;  Nettwerk has
hired a Chicago-based law office to defend Greubel and has said it will
pay any fines if the family loses the case.  The RIAA is asking for a
US$9,000 penalty, but will accept US$4,500 if it is paid within a
specified time period.
<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/27/nettwerk_sues_riaa/print.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/27/nettwerk_sues_riaa/print.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.techweb.com/wire/177104841">http://www.techweb.com/wire/177104841</A>
[Editor's Note (Schultz): This is a bizarre development; a company in
the Canadian entertainment industry is defending an American who has
downloaded copyright music from an RIAA  lawsuit. This kind of
development will only hurt the RIAA's efforts to stop illegal
downloading. At the same time, however, it is likely to help steer the
RIAA to more reasonable courses of action in the future.]

  --Men Ordered to Pay Penalties in File Sharing Case
(27 January 2006)
The British High Court has ordered two UK men to pay penalties totaling
GBP 6,500 (US$11,488) for making nearly 9,000 songs available for
downloading though peer-to-peer file sharing networks.  Cases are
pending against the other three people.  The cases were brought by the
British Phonographic Industry (BPI); the defendants have also been
ordered to pay the BPI's costs, pushing the total to more than GBP
20,000 (US$35,348).

  --Google CEO Defends China Decision; Google and Others Asked to Appear
     at Human Rights Hearings
(27 January 2006)
Google CEO Eric Schmidt said his company struggled with its decision to
launch a censored version of its search engine in China.  &quot;Although we
weren't wild about the restrictions, it was even worse to not try to
serve those users at all.&quot;  Google has been asked to appear before a
Congressional Human Rights Caucus hearing on February 1 and before a
session of the House of Representatives subcommittee on global human
rights on February 16.  Others invited to the February 16 hearing
include Yahoo, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and State Department officials
and representatives from press freedom watchdog groups.

  --Apple's Move to Intel Processors Could Open Machines to Attacks
(26 January 2006)
Apple's decision to use Intel processors in its Macintosh computers
could leave the new machines more open to attacks than those using the
Motorola Power PC processors, according to security experts.  The Intel
x86 platform is the same platform used by Windows; attackers understand
this architecture in greater depth than they do the PowerPC
architecture.  Furthermore, because the architecture is easier to audit
for security vulnerabilities, it is also easier for exploit writers to
create malicious code for the system.  There are more malware tools for
Intel x86 than for PowerPC.  However, software flaws are &quot;dependent&quot; on
the operating system rather than the underlying architecture.

[Editor's Note (Pescatore): The key to whether Intel-based Macs will be
less secure will mostly be determined by how good a job Apple did in
porting the code to the new hardware and how secure their
interoperability layer is for older apps. If they were sloppy or didn't
think through security as part of the effort, could be significant
increases in attack surface. The next biggest factor will be if the move
to Intel increases Mac market share to where attacks can be profitable.
The actual processor choice is a distant third.]

  --Vista's Two-Way Firewall Will Give Admins More Control
(26 January 2006)
Microsoft has been testing a new, two-way firewall for Windows Vista
that will let system administrators have more control over applications
on their networks; the firewall will filter incoming and outgoing
network traffic.  A consumer version of the firewall is being
considered.

[Editor's Note (Ranum): Any firewall worth a bucket of warm spit can
already filter both incoming and outgoing traffic. Sheesh!!]

  --Ameriprise Laptop Theft Update - Culpable Employee Fired
Last Friday we had a story about the theft of a laptop containing
Ameriprise customer data from an employee's car. One of our readers
wrote in telling us, &quot;I was one of the victims. I received a letter from
Ameriprise in which they state that the employee was not allowed to take
the laptop in the field and the data should have been encrypted
according to their company policy. As a result the employee was fired.&quot;
