<PRE>Hi Chapter members,
 
I hope you all enjoyed our &quot;hot&quot; Belgian summer?
 
I would like to propose to hold our second chapter meeting on Wednesday
28th of September. 
I don't think there is a timing overlap with other security events.
Please let me know if there is.
 
Place: to be defined, preferably near Brussels this time. 
If you have a venue available or you want to sponsor one, please shout!
 
Program: here I would appreciate your input. 
I would like to finalize the program by the 12th of September.
Some ideas:
OWASP update (now with OWASP membership plan)
Question: would you (or your company) consider becoming an OWASP member?
 
We can do a session on the new Guideline v2: any candidates to do this?
 
OWASP Top 10 revisited? Do they need to be revisited? Do we need a
localized version? 
Maybe we can do a panel discussion on this? 
If we do this, I suppose an OWASP top 10 introduction is also in order?
 
Does anyone of you have experience with ModSecurity
(<A HREF="http://www.modsecurity.org/">http://www.modsecurity.org/</A>) to do session on this?
 
Tom also asked for sessions on e.g.: 
Any talks about the future of websecurity? 
The tendencies of the current products on the market and their roadmaps?

The influence of Single-Sign-On? 
The implications and technology behind digital passports such as the
attempt made by Microsoft and Hotmail? 
Future expected attacks and the protection thereof? 
SSL VPN strengths, weaknesses and how to assess? 
Testimonies of people responsible for the security of webfarms of
50-100+ servers and their approach and views on the matter?
 
As already suggested it would be nice to have an intro-level and a more
experienced level topic discussed.
 
Please share you expectations for the next chapter meetings, any input
is welcome!
 
Thx,
 
With kind regards,
