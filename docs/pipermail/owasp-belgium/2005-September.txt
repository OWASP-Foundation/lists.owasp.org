we produce.

Subject: [Owasp-belgium] Earn 3 CPE points during the chapter meetings
Message-ID: <C840A806BF100245B61F70F24C28C2333092E6@CASTOR.office.ascure.com>

Dear,
 
For the CISSP's among us:
 
ISC2 has approved 1 CPE for each hour of an OWASP local chapter meeting.

Chapter leaders will have a sign up sheet with at least First Name, Last
Name, and the date of the OWASP Meeting. After the meeting, the single
sheet will be signed once by a chapter lead as proof of attendance,
scanned into a .PDF, and emailed out to the chapter members with the
meeting minutes so they have a copy for records and can claim CPE
credits. 
 
So I will have such a sheet with me on September 28th.
 
regards,
 

Sebastien Deleersnyder
