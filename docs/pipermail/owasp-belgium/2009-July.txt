Subject: [Owasp-belgium] New whitepaper + special action for our boot camp
Message-ID: <6A34A341DCBDDE4EA5EB33873CF8DD5724B6EF@zion.ZIONSECURITY.local>

Hi OWASP BE,

 

We published a new whitepaper: An overview of the current situation in
the web application security landscape.

Next week we hope to publish a whitepaper on selecting a secure
open-source CMS!

 

Today, most organizations use online applications to interact with
customers, suppliers, partners or internal colleagues. Some
applications, like online banking and online shops contain critical or
sensitive information. These applications should be well developed and
free of vulnerabilities to be protected against known threats such as
hackers and viruses.

In this paper we will discuss the overall state of website security by
providing some statistics. Download here:
http://www.zionsecurity.com/downloads/whitepapers/whitepaper-an-overview
-of-the-current-situation-in-the-web-application-security-landscape.aspx

 

For our boot camp next week, we have a last minute offering: 50%
discount for subscribing a colleague

Full agenda for 5 days of web application security here:
http://www.zionsecurity.com/our-solutions/zion-university/bootcamp.aspx

 

Best regards,

 

Erwin

All,
Please refrain from posting commercial e-mails on the owasp mailing list.
This mailing list is to discuss webapsec topics related to Belgium and local
chapter announcements.

Currently there is no moderation, but if this happens again we will be
forced to do so.

regards

Seba
