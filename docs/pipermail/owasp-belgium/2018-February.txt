Hi all,

we would like to thank everyone for the help they have provided for the set
up of OWASP booth in FOSDEM! It was an exciting first time and we are
certainly coming back next year with even more OWASP ;-)

*Impressions from interacting with the people:*

Having reached out to quite a lot of people these two days, our conclusions
are that a good potion of people, mostly developers and sysadmins are aware
of OWASP, they know mostly OWASP top 10 and they have consulted our
resources at least once (usually more, with some of them describing that
they include OWASP tools and /or resources on their regular product
lifecycle!)

We had people coming at the booth and saying just "Thank you for your
efforts! This is very useful!"

It is also remarkable that people with zero knowledge of OWASP were very
pleased to hear about who we are and what we do, showing a lot of interest!

People with academic roles that provide teaching over application security
and others that provide security training to their developers were quite
enthusiastic to hear about the educational projects we have, like juice
shop, hackademic etc, as well as the detailed resources and to my
understanding, at least 3-4 new schools/universities, will start using
OWASP material for their teaching purposes! ;-)

We also met people, that came over to the booth, to let us know that they
either use extensively a tool like ZAP (a lad working for the UK
government, for a gov payment gateway saying they are using ZAP with
Jenkins connection in every code sprint) or they are working on projects
like Dependency Checker and they wanted to discuss about these!


*Takeaways:*

* People love OWASP and what we do and it was like they were looking
forward to see OWASP there
* OWASP is quite attractive to people that are interested in security topics
* And they love the stickers too... :-P

Spyros and myself, we really enjoyed ourselves at the OWASP booth, met
interesting people, had quite interesting conversations regarding security
and would like to propose a few things for next year(s):

We believe that next year, OWASP should have a stronger presence at FOSDEM,
with the following additions:

* A bit more targeted material, e.g. instead this big A4 with OWASP info,
it would be better if we had OWASP Top 10 printed with short info, another
brochure with 10 most widely used projects, not only ZAP. Some more
information about subscriptions and the benefits of becoming a member,
submitting a project etc.
* Something interactive, like a screen or a projector with either some
videos or some live action of some tool
* Submit a talk about OWASP's contribution to Web Application Security and
how people can benefit form this (showcasing Projects, Tools, Resources),
and it would be nice to present something along the lines of a small survey
of companies or individuals that use OWASP tools/resources and their
results.
* (This is a bit tricky to organise and run but it would worth the effort!)
Organise a CTF event for the conference!

P.S. FOSDEM needs to feel the OWASP Rocket expeirence :-)


Cheers,
Antonis & Spyros
