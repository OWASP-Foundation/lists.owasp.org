Subject: [Owasp-leaders] OWASP's new Project Manager + OWASP Summer of
Code2008 + OWASP's Project Assessment Criteria

 

 

Hello everyone,

 

I wanted to introduce myself to one and all as OWASP's new Project Manager.


 

As some of you already know, I began working with OWASP part-time last year
as the SpoC's 07 Project Manager. 

 

Recently my relationship with OWASP has changed. We've agreed I'll be
working part-time until next June. After that, I'll assume the job on a full
time basis.

 

It is with great enthusiasm that I accepted this job. I will do my best to
live up to the trust that you have placed in me. 

 

As OWASP's Project Manager, here's an idea of my short-term work plans:

 

1 - To launch and manage the new season of code - OWASP Summer of Code 2008.

2 - To contribute to and stabilize OWASP's new Project Assessment Criteria. 

3 - To contribute to the assessment, and re-assessment, of all OWASP
projects.

4 - To build and maintain a wiki page with the status of all OWASP projects
and their assessments.

5 - To welcome new developers who are interested in joining OWASP community.

6 - To help project leaders and participants with their projects in any way
that I can.

 

I take this opportunity to say that your comments on
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008</A>&gt; OWASP Summer of
Code 2008 would certainly be very useful. In addition, we are also
interested in your opinions about the
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project_Assessment">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project_Assessment</A>&gt; OWASP's
Project Assessment Criteria. 

 

To summarize, I am very pleased about the prospect of contributing to the
achievements of this organization and look forward to this new phase of our
relationship. However, I know that my performance will depend on your
feedback. So, I am counting on it and I thank you all in advance.

 

Best regards,

 

Paulo Coimbra

OWASP Project Manager
