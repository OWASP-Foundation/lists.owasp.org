You are invited to attend:

OWASP Netherlands Chapter Meeting
with Jim Manico!

Thursday, March 15th, 2012
Utrecht, The Netherlands


   Jim Manico

   Bio:

   Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security. Jim
is
   part of the WhiteHat Static Analysis Software Testing (SAST) team,
leading
   the data-driven, Web service portion of the SAST service. He also
provides
   secure coding and developer awareness training for WhiteHat using his 7+
   years of experience delivering developer-training courses for SANS,
Aspect
   Security and others.


   Abstract:

   Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer
within
   a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key access
control
   anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits. These access
   control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, lack of
   horizontal access control, and "fail open" access control mechanisms. In
   reviewing these and other access control problems, we will discuss and
   design a positive access control mechanism that is data contextual,
activity
   based, configurable, flexible, and deny-by-default - among other positive
   design attributes that make up a robust web-based access-control
mechanism.


   Programme:

   18:00 - 18:45  Registration & Snack

   18:45 - 19:00  OWASP Netherlands Chapter Update

   19:00 - 20:00  Jim Manico on Authentication

   20:15 - 21:00  Q&A with Jim Manico

Directions

By public transport

   SURFnet is within easy reach from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. By train it
   takes about 30 min. From Schiphol Station (below the airport) take an
   intercity train (every 15 min.) in the direction of Utrecht, Eindhoven or
   Nijmegen. All will stop at Utrecht Central Station (Utrecht CS).

   Having arrived at Utrecht Central Station, take the central station hall
as
   your starting point, follow the signs Centrum/Hoog Catharijne and walk
   into the mall, keeping to the left. After about 20 metres you will see
the
   sign Radboudburcht on the left. Walk into the corridor. You will find
   glass doors at the end of the corridor. Ring the bell for SURFnet to have
   the reception open the doors for you. Take the elevator to the fourth
floor.
     * Consult our [3]multimedia directions.

   By car
   Currently, a great deal of roads in Utrecht are being worked on.
   Check [5]www.utrechtbereikbaar.nl for the latest information.
   A2:
   On the A2 (Amsterdam - Utrecht - Den Bosch) take the exit Utrecht-Oog in
   Al or Utrecht-Centrum . You are now driving on Vleutenseweg or Graadt van
   Roggenweg towards the city centre. Follow the signs Centrum/Station.
   Immediately after passing underneath the railway crossing you enter a
   roundabout. (You will see a police station straight across.) Exit to the
   right immediately. Follow the signs Hoog Catharijne .
   A28:
   On the A28 (Amersfoort) follow the signs Utrecht-Noord. Take the
   exit Veemarkthallen, turning left taking the underpass. From here, follow
   the signs Centrum and Hoog Catharijne. Once you are on Weerdsingel,
   you will enter a round-about. (You will see a police station to your
left.)
   Turn left.
   A2 and A28 continued:
   After leaving the roundabout, follow the sign Station and keep to the
   right avoiding the underpass. After the second crossing immediately take
the
   first street on the right, Stationsstraat. Park you car in car park P3,
   Radboud, which you will find on the left.
   Inside the car park you can take either of the two elevators (marked as
   stairs on the [6]Map Hoog Catharijne) to the shopping level. Leave the
   elevator and walk towards the Central Station. As you are about to
   enter Stationstraverse you see an office block, Radboudburcht, signposted
   on the right. Walk into the corridor. You will find glass doors at the
end
   of the corridor. Ring the bell for SURFnet to have the reception open the
   doors for you. Take the elevator to the fourth floor.
