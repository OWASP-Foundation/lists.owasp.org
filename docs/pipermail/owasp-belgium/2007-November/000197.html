<PRE>Hi,

 

Please take some time to read the mail below.

These are not simple (yes/no) questions.

 

You can answer to the list or me personally by Nov 7: I will summarize this
towards the OWASP leaders.

Your opinion does count! 

 

Thx

 

Seba

Following Tom's (i.e. Jinxpuppy) suggestion below, let's set the review time
for these questions to 5 working days, and the deadline for submissions next
Thursday, the 8th of November

Regarding how you can submit these ideas, there are two main ways I see this
working: a) we all use this page
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/What_do_you_want_OWASP_to_be">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/What_do_you_want_OWASP_to_be</A>  or b) we set
up some kind of online questionnaire

Recapping, the plan is for both OWASP projects and chapters leaders to
consult their communities and answer the following question: 

As it grows: what do you want OWASP to become?

1.	A certifying and CBK type pseudo-company like (ISC)2?
2.	An open source project organized along the lines of Debian, Apache,
or a similar group that owns a set of projects? 
3.	Does OWASP want to certify apps, testers, both or none? (I've seen
all POV advocated)
4.	Who will be required to pay what kind of dues, if any?
5.	How formal of an organization will OWASP become?
6.	Is the status quo preferable to the proposed change?
7.	Other?

Thanks for participating and I look forward to your answers

Dinis/all
I propose a review period for each chapter and a submission by each chapter
by (insert deadline) to collect such feedback.  There are 101 chapters
right? So we we should use the wizdom of crowds agreement on issues
worldwide to send a message to the current OWASP Foundation board of what
the chapter leads need/want etc. 

Then you can easily formulate a tally and do a membership (6223 members
right) survey to get a majority direction. (You could do this 1st however
the membership is frag'ed - mailing list member does not equal active member
such as tool dev, book dev, chapter lead etc... 

As a example, I have 9 boardmembers in NY/NJ Metro and only 3 of us are on
this mailing list hence at the local chapter level I propose time to gather
that info...

Then we can submit a &quot;statement from chapter A, chapter B etc etc etc to
whom ever is going to tally it. 

Good questions all of them ~ I hope to discuss them all at the San Jose 2007
OWASP event at the chapter leader dinner or have a deadline set for the
questions so in our case we can ask our 571 mailing list members then take
that info and compress it, then vote at the board level and finally submit
answers - &quot;that's how we roll in metro&quot;

about how to best organize OWASP - 
interesting discussion but if we take that approach we may end up with
an OWASP that doesn't meet anyone's needs goal-wise, just
structure-wise. Which doesn't mean much.

It sounds like more fundamantally theres a debate going on about the 
direction of OWASP -as it grows, what's it to become?

- A certifying and CBK type pseudo-company like (ISC)2?
- An open source project organized along the lines of Debian, Apache, or
a similar group that owns a set of projects? 
- Does OWASP want to certify apps, testers, both or none? (I've seen all
POV advocated)
- Who will be required to pay what kind of dues, if any?
- How formal of an organization will OWASP become?
- Is the status quo preferable to the proposed change? 

These are some of the more basic questions I've seen bubble to
the surface... IMO better to address these big questions and then
figure out how the structure could best support it... rather than end up
with a bunch of rules and regs that don't fit anyone in particular.

Just my .02!
