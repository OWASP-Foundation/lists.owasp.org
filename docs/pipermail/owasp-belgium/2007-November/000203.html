<PRE>FYI

Seba
==============

secappdev.org is proud to announce a one-week intensive course in
secure application development. secappdev.org is a non-profit
organization dedicated to improving security awareness and skills in
the developer community. The course is a joint project with
K.U. Leuven, Solvay Business School and L-SEC.

Developers focus on providing functionality, not on security. In
contrast to security personnel who are paid to stop bad things from
happening, developers' contribution to the value chain is building
enabling technology. Despite increasing malicious targeting and
exploitation of applications, this is the correct priority.
Nonetheless, the software industry is being forced to re-examine the
way software is built, shipped and deployed. The traditional approach
of securing the perimeter is proving to be inadequate and it is
apparent that developers have to take their share of responsibility
for improving application security.

secappdev 2008 follows the highly appreciated courses in 2005, 2006
and 2007, attended by an international audience from a wide range of
industries including financial services, telecom and entertainment. In
order to offer an effective learning environment, we limit the number
of participants. This allows for optimal interaction between
participants and faculty and thus we provide an immersive experience
with plenty of discussion on security topics, both in and outside the
seminar room.

The course is taught by leading experts including

- Prof. dr. ir. Bart Preneel who heads COSIC, the renowned crypto lab.
- Prof. dr. ir. Frank Piessens who pioneered application security
  teaching at university level
- Ken van Wyk, co-founder of CERTR Coordination Center and widely
  acclaimed author and lecturer.
- Prof. dr. ir. Axel van Lamsweerde, a world authority on
  Requirements Engineering.
- Dr. Wietse Venema, the author of some of the most wxsidely used
  Internet software.

The course takes place from March 3rd to March 7th in the Groot
Begijnhof in Leuven, Belgium, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis.

I hope that we will be able to welcome you or your colleagues to this
important course.

kr,
