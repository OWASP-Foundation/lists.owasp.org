The ISSA Brussels-European Chapter is proud to announce its September 2007
Information Security Event:

"Welcome to the The Weakest Link!" 

Contrary to what this title suggests, ISSA will NOT be hosting this famous
television quiz show. So there is no need to be afraid of being sent away
due to a lack of knowledge concerning trivia. However, there are some
similarities with the topic of this event, Social Engineering. Eg., things
you don't know about, might hurt you badly. And the Weakest Link in
Information Security is very often located " Between Keyboard And Chair". A
50.000 EUR security device may protect your information assets as perfectly
as possible, but if an employee provides his login credentials in exchange
for a candybar, you might have to walk "The Walk of Shame" anyway... This
ISSA event will be more interactive than usual. But you'll go home better
informed and less vulnerable, as usual. 

This evening event will be held on: Thursday, September 20th, 2007

Place : Getronics Executive Briefing Center, Leopold Tower, Rue de
Gen?vestraat 10, 1140 Brussels (Evere) 

Agenda :

*	1800h : Welcome with drinks and sandwiches (PLEASE FOLLOW ACCESS
PROCEDURE MENTIONED BELOW ! NO ACCESS AFTER 1900HRS !)

*	1830h : Part 1 - Presentation

Social engineering- definition 
Historical overview 
What's the motive behind social engineering 
The human element 
Known exploits 
Approaches to protecting your company against social engineering

*	1930h : short break 

*	1945h : Part 2 - Workshop - Steal the flag 

The target - "Secrus Traders Inc." (A fictional company) financial results 
Group A - will represent the social engineering attackers 
Group B - will represent the security department of  "Secrus Traders Inc"

Members of Group A will need to define a timely driven attack scenario
against "Secrus Traders Inc." corporation in an attempt to steal the next
quarterly financial results. 

Members of Group B will need to define timely driven measures to try to
increase the awareness of the organization, managing management, employees,
and public. 

End of part 2 - Presentation of Group A and Group B strategies, comments
from the participants. 

*	2045h : closing drink
