Hi,

We have already received lots of feedback on the new OWASP Top 10. See
e.g. on PCI DSS blog
<http://datasecurity.wordpress.com/2007/02/05/owasp-top-10-for-2007/>
with some interesting comments and of course Sylvan von Stuppe's
comments can be found here
<http://sylvanvonstuppe.blogspot.com/2007/02/owasp-top-10-2007-update-rc
1-a7-a8.html> (A7-A8), here

prior to February 28th and provide feedback to the 
owasp-topten at lists.owasp.org

The presentation will be on the 21st and 22nd of March, each time at 16h
in Room B of the "Vendor" sessions.


Maybe afterwards we can organize a social gathering? 

 

I will be sending personal invitations next week.

 

I hope to see you there! 

 

Kind regards,

 

Seba

Subject: [Owasp-belgium] New OWASP Education project as result of Belgium
	chapter request
Message-ID: <C840A806BF100245B61F70F24C28C23395431B@CASTOR.office.ascure.com>

Hi,

 

As a result of the question to create a web application security
introduction for newbie's I started the OWASP Education Project.

The Education project page can be found at 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project.

 

One of my first questions to you is:

What are your thoughts on the project goals? Can they be rephrased
better?

I would like to invite you to think about it and provide feedback to the
list for discussion during this week.

 

I have started an OWASP presentation consolidation page
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Education_Presentation_Rating>  to
create an inventory of what is already available.

There are currently hundreds of presentations all over the OWASP web
site. 

If you search google with "site:owasp.org filetype:ppt" there are 166
hits. "site:owasp.org filetype:pdf" returns 76.

Feel free to "mine" them and add them to the overview.

 

If you already feel the urge to contribute: do not hesitate to add stuff
to the roadmap page with tasks and progress.

 

Thanks!

 

Kind regards,

 

Seba
