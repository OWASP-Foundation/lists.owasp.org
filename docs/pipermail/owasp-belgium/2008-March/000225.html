I have those contacts at the ULB.

I will poke them to ask them if it's possible to organise the event 

there. But note that currently the ULB policy has changed since a few 

years and that they charge some money for using the rooms. It is also not 

easy to get rooms on saturday mornging (till 1300) because teachers 

always have priority.

&gt;<i> conference on May 22-23 (estimate 100 to 400 people) in or near Brussels
</I>
&gt;<i> would be most welcome!

What kind of exact logistics do you need? Two rooms of approx 200-300 

seats each, some other rooms for sponsor stands? Place with refreshments? 

Staff that manages the food/drinks? Or do you handle finding a catering 

service? ... Please send me this info asap by mail.

Once I know this I'll poke my ULB contacts.

PS: Is there a list of people that will be present at Infosecurity? I'll 

be there the second day but currently I'm not really familiar with the 

OWASP-belgium community...
