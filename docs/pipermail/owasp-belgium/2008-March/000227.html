Hi everyone,

 

I know many of you have blogs and mailing lists!  Please take this
opportunity to spread the word about OWASPs fantastic Summer of Code 2008.
Together we can accomplish something really amazing with this money, but we
need people to read the RFPs
(<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Request_for_Proposal_List">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Request_for_Proposal_List</A>) and apply
for grants.

 

Thanks for your help!

 

--Jeff

Subject: [Owasp-leaders] To advertise the launch of OWASP Summer of Code
2008

 

Hi leaders,

 

As you know, a fortnight ago I've sent you all the email below asking for
help in order to advertise the OWASP
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Press_Release">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Press_Release</A>&gt;
Summer of Code 2008. Unfortunately, I haven't received any answers which I
understood perfectly as you all certainly have loads of work to do and much
more interesting things to think about.  Therefore, I've assumed this task
on my own and I took a stab at trying to draw attention to this new season
of code. To do so, I've used the email list that I am sending in attach and
I just achieve these poor results &lt;<A HREF="http://owaspsoc2008.wordpress.com/">http://owaspsoc2008.wordpress.com/</A>&gt; . 

 

Due to that, I felt forced to chase you once again. I need to ask one more
time either for media/press email addresses or for you to send directly the
press
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Press_Release">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Press_Release</A>&gt;
release to whom you find appropriate. Could you please help me out? Please
forgive my insistence - I thank you in advance. In my opinion, the SoC 2008
brings about a good opportunity to advertise the work that we all are trying
to do and it would be a drawback to waste it. 

 

Best regards,

 

Paulo Coimbra

OWASP Project Manager

Hi all,

 

First, I would like to sincerely thank to you all that have kindly welcomed
me. 

 

Next, as I am trying to advertise the launch of OWASP Summer of Code 2008, I
need to ask to you all for media/press emails addresses. Could you please
help me out? I thank you in advance.
