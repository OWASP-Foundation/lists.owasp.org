I have those contacts at the ULB.
I will poke them to ask them if it's possible to organise the event 
there. But note that currently the ULB policy has changed since a few 
years and that they charge some money for using the rooms. It is also not 
easy to get rooms on saturday mornging (till 1300) because teachers 
always have priority.

&gt;<i> Any other input for a possible location where we can organise the 2 track

</I>&gt;<i> would be most welcome!

What kind of exact logistics do you need? Two rooms of approx 200-300 
seats each, some other rooms for sponsor stands? Place with refreshments? 
Staff that manages the food/drinks? Or do you handle finding a catering 
service? ... Please send me this info asap by mail.
Once I know this I'll poke my ULB contacts.

PS: Is there a list of people that will be present at Infosecurity? I'll 
be there the second day but currently I'm not really familiar with the 
OWASP-belgium community...
