Serge Moreno, ING

Serge Moreno was born in Gent, Belgium on 20/5/1959. He obtained a
master degree in science (specialization mathematics) in 1980 and a
master in IT in 1983. His professional career started in august 1983 in
BBL (Bank Brussels Lambert) which was later incorporated in ING. He was
first system engineer to later lead the helpdesk for IT operations and
development. In 1995, he started the IT systems audit group focusing on
technology audits in the audit department. In 2000, he became the
information security officer of ING Belgium and took in that role the
responsibility of south west Europe. The latest change occurred in 2004,
where he joined Global Information Risk Management at ING group level to
take care of business application security. During his career, Serge
also acquired the title of CISA Certified Information systems Auditor
and CISM Certified Information Security Manager.

&quot;Business Application Security through Information Risk Management&quot;:
Presentation + Discussion

The presentation will show how ING has implemented business application
security by implementing a risk management approach. By starting from
the definition of risks and risk management, we have changed the program
governance and project lifecycle to ensure that security is not seen as
an add-on in a late stage of the project, but that the security
requirements are defined in the early start of a project. By this
approach the security requirements are becoming real functional
requirements which are supported by the business. The net result is that
security is not an after-thought anymore but totally integrated in the
product and its (functional) requirements. As security requirements have
become demands of the business, they are not taken out when the project
is getting in time and budget constraints. These are all the positive
consequences we have obtained from the method that will be explained
throughout the presentation.

*	19h55 - 20h05: break
*	20h05 - 21h00: 

Guy Crets, Apogado

After graduating as an Industrial Engineer from IHAM Antwerp in 1987,
Guy started developing business applications with 4GLs such as Mapper
and Informix 4GL.  Next came document management, client/server and
component based development.  But for the last 8 years, Guy has been
integrating applications and systems using all sorts of techniques: from
screen-scraping and JMS to SAP Netweaver. 

Guy Crets is Managing Partner of Apogado and a certified SonicMQ and
Tibco BusinessWorks consultant.

&quot;Secure and Reliable Web Services&quot;: Presentation + Discussion

Web Services are becoming a very popular protocol for communication
between IT systems within and between organizations.  Web services offer
a nice alternative for all sorts of communication middleware. The
security of Web Services is a major attention point, now being well
addressed with the WS-Security standards.

Guy Crets not only explains what WS-Security is, but also opens up the
subject by addressing many related topics: how does WS-* compare to B2B
protocols such as EDIINT AS2, why not use SOAP over email or FTP, the
importance of WS-Addressing, shortcomings in WS-ReliableMessaging, what
is the importance of Microsoft WCF (aka Indigo), ...  and many more.
