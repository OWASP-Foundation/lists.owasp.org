FYI



Dear OWASP,

Next week on Tuesday the 13th of November 2018 we will have at the
university (ULB, Campus de la Plaine) the next edition of Fosdem x.

This edition is on the subject of security and we would like to share
this event with the OWASP-mailing list.

The event takes place in the evening and is free. We just ask to
register foor our workshops.

More information can be found at our website
https://x.fosdem.org/1/


Would it be possible to announce this on the OWASP-mailing list?

Kind regards,
Erik
