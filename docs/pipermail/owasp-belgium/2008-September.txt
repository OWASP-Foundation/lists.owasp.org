Dear ISSA-BE Member,
Dear Information Security Professional,

The ISSA Brussels-European Chapter is proud to announce its next Information
Security Event!

"A Day in the Life of the SANS Internet Storm Center"

The SANS (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security) Institute was established in
1989 as a cooperative research and education organization. Today it is a
very renown organisation providing training, certification and information
dissemination in the fields of system administration and information
security. Alongside all these activities, SANS also operates the Internet
Storm Center, an early warning system run by volunteers which watches out
for malicious
activities on the Internet.

Malicious trends are spotted due to people from all over the world sending
in their anonymized firewall logs to Dshield, a SANS ISC distributed
intrusion detection system for data collection and analysis. A truly
international team of volunteers ("Handlers") from all over the world is
using automated analysis and graphical visualization tools to search for
activity that corresponds with broad based attacks. They report their
findings to the Internet community
through the ISC main web site, directly to ISPs, and via general postings
and emails to newsgroups or public information sharing forums. They also
spread the news if important new vulnerabilities in common software
applications are being discovered.

We as information security professionals benefit a lot from the efforts of
those volunteers who are on top of what's happening in our field. They have
interesting stories and insights to tell and that's why we as the ISSA
Brussels-European Chapter are very happy to have found a possibility to have
the two Belgian SANS ISC Handlers give a joint presentation about "A Day in
the Life of the SANS Internet Storm Center"! They told me they would leave a
lot of room for questions, so finally I will get to know how they manage to
stay awake from 0000hrs to 2359hrs UTC!

We hope to welcome you on this very interesting security event!

High Regards
Tomas Vanhoof
2008 Vice President + Education & General Events Officer of the ISSA

	meeting on Oct 23?
Message-ID: <cc88ce390809300438rdd3cc44m1b39e310ed7bb2e7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Block your agenda's!
We'll have Dinis Cruz and Eddy Vanlerberghe.
More details soon on the wiki.

Can somebody help us find a host in Brussels for the upcoming chapter
meeting on October 23rd ?

Meeting details:
Timing: 18h-21h
Normally we have around 40-50 people
It would be great (but not necessary) if catering is included.
Preferably in Brussels, as Dinis has to catch a train back to the UK the
same evening.

Thank you!

Seba
