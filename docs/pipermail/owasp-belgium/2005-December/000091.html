Subject: [Owasp-belgium] Belgium Chapter 2005 poll results


Hi,
 
Thank you for your responses!
 
Attached you will find the results and first analysis of the poll of
last week.
 
My findings are:
1) 19% of the subscribed members answered within 2 days. Which I think
is a good result.
After New York, New Jersey, Seattle, Italy we are the 5th biggest
chapter in the world and 2nd biggest chapter outside the US after Italy
(87 members).

2) We have a nice mix of novice and experts. 
This supports a dual track approach for the chapter meetings: an
introduction part and a session with advanced content.
 
3) Suggests that we should indeed be aiming for at least 3, maybe 4
sessions a year.

4) 5 people were considering to give a presentations. This looks
promising; we should succeed in organizing chapter sessions with at
least one chapter member preparing a topic. We could additionally invite
external speakers as well.
 
I am looking forward to your opinion on the above results.
 
I would also propose to start next year with an informal New Years Drink
in January: 
Thursday evening 19th of January ok for everybody?
Are there suggestions, or sponsors :-), for a venue?
 
Best wishes for you and your family in 2006 !
 
Kind regards,
 
Seba
