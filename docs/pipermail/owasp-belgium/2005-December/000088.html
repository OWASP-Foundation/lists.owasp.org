<PRE>Q1: I consider myself an experienced risk manager in the domain of
application security. In other words, no knowledge on teechnical points
or specific points within a development environment.
Talking technics - I'm novice, but worse I'm not really interested. I'm
probably not the target audience for a normal OWASP meeting.
 
Q2: As my office is mainly in Amsterdam, I have difficulties to attend
session during the week in Brussels, unless announced long before date
and the topics interests me. With the previous conditions in mind, I
have no problem in attending 3 to 4 meetings, but due to my lack of
technological knowledge, I will even if planning the meeting well in
advance, I will probably limit my presence to 2 times. (hope I'm cclear)
 
Q3: I'm willing to prepare a subject, as long as it is NOT technical,
but managerial. E.g. explain how ING incorporated the Information risk
requirements (and thus security requirements) in the Project lifecycle.

Subject: [Owasp-belgium] Cancelled + Quick poll - next owasp chapter
meeting


Dear Chapter members,
 
I appreciate the input you all send me, but I think it is better to
postpone the chapter meeting to next year.
 
Probably we can set up a New-Year's drink in January to talk about how
to fill in the Chapter objectives for 2006 ?
 
My proposal is to split up the chapter meetings in 2 parts:
e.g. 18h-19h - introduction and session for people who are new on the
(We)AppSec matter
19h-20h - an advanced topic (like suggested by Tom on e.g. evasion
techniques).
 
I would like to hold a quick poll (answer to me, I'll post back the
compiled answers by the end of the week):
Q1: Do you consider yourself:
a) &quot;new to beginner&quot; on (Web)AppSec topics
b) &quot;advaced to expert&quot; on (Web)AppSec topics
 
Q2: How many chapter meetings would you like to attend in 2006:
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
 
Q3: If given some time to prepare a topic, would you consider preparing
a session for a chapter meeting:
a) yes
b) no
 
Thanks for your responses!
 
Kind regards,
 
Seba

Subject: RE: [Owasp-belgium] next owasp chapter meeting + JavaPolis
Quickie
Importance: High


Dear chapter members,
 
Up until now I have not received any suggestions and or proposals to do
something on the next chapter meeting, 
except one proposal for a more general non-OWASP related presentation
(appreciated).
 
I want to make clear that the chapter meetings are organized for you to
exchange experience and knowledge on OWASP related subjects.

It benefits us all, when you provide input and feedback on the OWASP
discussions and projects.
This chapter will only become succesful if you participate. 
 
I am personally not looking for &quot;ready-made&quot; presentations, although
they can be helpful.
I am asking you: 
1) your opinion on what should be done during the next chapter
meeting(s)?
Should we elaborate in more detail on current OWASP projects?
Do we create local sub-groups that take on specific topics such as e.g.
Belgian awareness sessions, Legal projects for Belgian Law?
Do we organize a Q&amp;A session on novice topics, or on expert topics?
How do we liaison with Belgian universities or high-schools to put
application security on the curriculum?
etc...
2) to take one of these or your own topic and do something with it
during the next meeting: presentation, Q&amp;A, workshop, sub-group, ...
3) Testimonials on how OWASP material (could have) helped you with your
particular job or project are also highly welcome
 
I am extending the period for proposals/ideas/remarks to Sunday Dec 4th.
If I have not received enough feedback to set up the next OWASP meeting
on Dec 12th we will have to postpone the chapter meeting to next year.
 
Only together can we do this.
 
Thank you
 
With kind regards,
 
Seba

Hi,
 
The next OWASP chapter meeting will be held in Antwerp at Agfa-Gevaert
(sponsor) on Wednesday 14th of December 18h-21h.
So please already reserve some time in your agendas.
 
Input / proposals on presentations or topics to discuss are most
welcome.
 
I would like to have a program by Nov 25th to start inviting people.
 

Thank you!
 
I will also do a quickie on JavaPolis <A HREF="http://www.javapolis.com/">http://www.javapolis.com/</A> to
introduce OWASP to the Java community.
 
 
Regards,
 
Seba
