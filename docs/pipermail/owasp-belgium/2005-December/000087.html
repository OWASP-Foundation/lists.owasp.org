<PRE>Dear Chapter members,
 
I appreciate the input you all send me, but I think it is better to
postpone the chapter meeting to next year.
 
Probably we can set up a New-Year's drink in January to talk about how
to fill in the Chapter objectives for 2006 ?
 
My proposal is to split up the chapter meetings in 2 parts:
e.g. 18h-19h - introduction and session for people who are new on the
(We)AppSec matter
19h-20h - an advanced topic (like suggested by Tom on e.g. evasion
techniques).
 
I would like to hold a quick poll (answer to me, I'll post back the
compiled answers by the end of the week):
Q1: Do you consider yourself:
a) &quot;new to beginner&quot; on (Web)AppSec topics
b) &quot;advaced to expert&quot; on (Web)AppSec topics
 
Q2: How many chapter meetings would you like to attend in 2006:
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
 
Q3: If given some time to prepare a topic, would you consider preparing
a session for a chapter meeting:
a) yes
b) no
 
Thanks for your responses!
 
Kind regards,
 
Seba

	Subject: RE: [Owasp-belgium] next owasp chapter meeting +
JavaPolis Quickie
	Importance: High
	
	
	Dear chapter members,
	 
	Up until now I have not received any suggestions and or
proposals to do something on the next chapter meeting, 
	except one proposal for a more general non-OWASP related
presentation (appreciated).
	 
	I want to make clear that the chapter meetings are organized for
you to exchange experience and knowledge on OWASP related subjects.
	
	It benefits us all, when you provide input and feedback on the
OWASP discussions and projects.
	This chapter will only become succesful if you participate. 
	 
	I am personally not looking for &quot;ready-made&quot; presentations,
although they can be helpful.
	I am asking you: 
	1) your opinion on what should be done during the next chapter
meeting(s)?
	Should we elaborate in more detail on current OWASP projects?
	Do we create local sub-groups that take on specific topics such
as e.g. Belgian awareness sessions, Legal projects for Belgian Law?
	Do we organize a Q&amp;A session on novice topics, or on expert
topics?
	How do we liaison with Belgian universities or high-schools to
put application security on the curriculum?
	etc...
	2) to take one of these or your own topic and do something with
it during the next meeting: presentation, Q&amp;A, workshop, sub-group, ...
	3) Testimonials on how OWASP material (could have) helped you
with your particular job or project are also highly welcome
	 
	I am extending the period for proposals/ideas/remarks to Sunday
Dec 4th.
	If I have not received enough feedback to set up the next OWASP
meeting on Dec 12th we will have to postpone the chapter meeting to next
year.
	 
	Only together can we do this.
	 
	Thank you
	 
	With kind regards,
	 
	Seba
