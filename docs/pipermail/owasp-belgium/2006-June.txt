Hi Chapter members!

For you who did not notice it yet: OWASP 2.0 is online!
Have a look at and find out how easy it is to edit / contribute it is.
http://www.owasp.org/

I have uploaded the presentations of the last chapter meeting online: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Belgium

I will migrate the rest soon.

For those who joined the conference: how did you like it?

Have fun,

Kind regards,

Seba
Chapter Lead

Hi ,

There is a new version of hacmebank (since end of April, but I apparently
missed it) including web services . The installation went very smoothly
after installing .NET1.1 and then MSDE2000A, followed by the WS and website
software.

 

Checkout the free tools on HYPERLINK

Greetings,

Philippe
