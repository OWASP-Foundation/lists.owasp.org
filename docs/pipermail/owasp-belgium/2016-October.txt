Subject: [Owasp-belgium] OWASP member discount on threat modeling course
Message-ID: <CAAihoGsCHOBVWwm4+mqqKbs1vpQNxGDK-q8cuWKShEFMPNkDuw@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

Shameless plug warning.
This is a post on behalf of my company, not OWASP.

But I do want to post this, as the course is on-topic and this helps to
drive OWASP membership...

We are organizing a public hands-on Threat Modeling training on 15-16 nov
in Ghent. I gave this training at AppSecEU in Rome and got great feedback
from the participants.
OWASP members get 10% discount, so now is the time to do the math and
become a member if you consider joining this course!
