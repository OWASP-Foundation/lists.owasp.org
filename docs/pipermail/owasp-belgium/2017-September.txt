Subject: [Owasp-belgium] [OWASP-cheat-sheets] Basic Authentication for

I agree, Pawel. In fact, I am working on a description of OAuth 2.0
right now and was planning to point out that the Client Credentials
Grant and Resource Owner Password Grant have similar security
characteristics to Basic Authentication. Nonetheless, there may be
arguments for preferring them over Basic Authentication:
+ it is a first step toward using an Security Token Service (STS)
+ authN/Z logic is moved from the API endpoint to the STS. If there
are many services, such centralisation makes access control a lot more
manageable.

What do you think?
