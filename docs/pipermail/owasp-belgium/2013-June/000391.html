<PRE>Dear,

Please have a look at this survey and respond or forward as appropriate.

Best wishes and thanks a lot for you help!

Seba

Dear colleague,

as a respected information security executive in the industry, OWASP (Open
Web Application Security Project, www.owasp.org) would like to hear your
opinion!

Link to take the CISO Survey 2013
now&lt;<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey</A>&gt;

OWASP is preparing the Global CISO report 2013 and conducting a survey
among CISOs and information security managers in relation to application
security with the aim of providing you with new insights about the state of
application security across various industry sectors and about new security
trends and aligning our efforts to better help solving the problems of the
future that you face.

The survey shall take only a few minutes of your precious time and by
completing it you are helping shape the future of OWASP, the Internet and
software security.
At the conclusion of the survey, the aggregated results will be publicly
available in the form of a report on the owasp.org website, keeping your
information completely anonymous.

As you may know OWASP is a volunteer open-source organization dedicated to
fighting the causes of software insecurity. We are also a registered
charity &amp; non-profit in the USA and the EU. See more at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP</A>

The survey can be found here: <A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey</A>

And to spice things up, during the first 14 days of June (until June-16
23:59 GMT), if you provide your contact details at the end of the survey,
you will also be entered into a drawing for one of the following donated
prizes:

   - 1 free OWASP CISO training day pass at the AppSecEU in
Hamburg&lt;<A HREF="https://appsec.eu/trainings/ciso-training-managing-web-application-security-owasp-for-senior-managers/">https://appsec.eu/trainings/ciso-training-managing-web-application-security-owasp-for-senior-managers/</A>&gt;
   - 1 free OWASP CISO training day pass at the AppSecUS in New
York&lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/</A>&gt;
   - and 1 free CISO training day or half-day pass at one of the upcoming
   events in Asia.


Thank you very much in advance for your time.

Best regards,

 OWASP CISO Survey Project team
