Message-ID: <AANLkTin-MOOAjyEAcOFybXhcuVs6Qx7ShRicYkxX4-97@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Benelux members,

I wanted to inform everyone that the schedule of BruCON 2010 is online. A
small non-profit community-driven security conference in Brussels featuring
various topics including application security. While there are no specific
discount codes, normal tickets are only 150 euro.

Participants are welcome to contribute their own topics to the conference
and you can still register for a lightning talk. Only rule is:
non-commercial, ethical and legal topics only. ;-)

Title:
======
Advanced SQL Injection

Program Summary:
================
SQL Injection is a vulnerability that is often missed by web application
security scanners, and it's a vulnerability that is often rated as NOT
exploitable by security testers when it actually can be exploited.

Advanced SQL Injection is a presentation geared toward showing
security professionals advanced exploitation techniques for situations
when you must prove to the customer the extent of compromise that is
possible.

The key areas are:

       * Re-Enabling stored procedures
       * Old and new ways of obtaining an interactive command-shell
       * Data Exfiltration via DNS
       * IDS Evasion & Web Application Firewall Bypass
       * Privilege Escalation



Bio:
=======
Joe McCray has 10 years of experience in the security industry with a
diverse background that includes network and web application penetration
testing, forensics, training, and regulatory compliance. Joe is a
frequent presenter at security conferences, and has taught Ethical
Hackng and Web Application Security at Johns Hopkins University (JHU),
University of Maryland Baltimore College (UMBC), and several other
technical training centers across the country.
