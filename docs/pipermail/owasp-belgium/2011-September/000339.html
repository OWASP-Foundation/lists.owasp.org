Ofer,

I love the approach, I agree that jobs are of interest to the OWASP
membership - it is the head-hunters who turn things into a circus. I will be
interested to know how your approach works out. I will be particularly
interested to know if the direct advertising and no head hunters approach is
sufficient.

Cheers,

&gt;<i> Hi Wil,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your timing couldn't be better - I just had a couple of days ago a long
</I>&gt;<i> correspondence about it with TomB about job openings in the chapter list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My take here, which has been proven as working wonderfully on the OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> Israel list (with over 700 subscribers) is to allow job listings on the
</I>&gt;<i> list. We have a very clear policy on what we allow or disallow in that
</I>&gt;<i> respect, but we definitely think that our community which consists of many
</I>&gt;<i> appsec specialists, wants to hear about such job openings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our policy is quite simple. We allow posting of jobs that require appsec
</I>&gt;<i> skills (i.e. if you're an AppSec vendor looking for a system admin - no.
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> if u'r looking for an application pentester, then by all means do).
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally the job has to be here (i.e. Israel) - you cannot use the list to
</I>&gt;<i> post just jobs anywhere around the globe. You can post each job to the list
</I>&gt;<i> one time. If you have several open positions - you should merge them into
</I>&gt;<i> one mail. We don't have a clear policy on the frequency of separate mails,
</I>&gt;<i> we play it by ear, but we never had yet an abuse problem with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also - should you submit a job, it should have full details about the
</I>&gt;<i> company and position - it's not a place for headhunters and recruiters who
</I>&gt;<i> hide the employer. We also encourage the submitters to be the relevant
</I>&gt;<i> professional person, and not turn this into some HR arena.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bottom line - this works for us. We get jobs posted by people from our own
</I>&gt;<i> community, who are looking for other appsec specialists in their
</I>&gt;<i> organizations. There is no abuse here, and it provides value for our
</I>&gt;<i> members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ofer.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Owasp-leaders] Job Leads on Chapter Mailing Lists?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A member of our chapter sent me an email personally asking if it was
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate to send real, vetted job leads to the chapter mailing list.  I
</I>&gt;<i> responded on both sides of the coin, which doesn't help much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the idea because:
</I>&gt;<i> * It's a down economy.  That may very well be helpful to a chapter member
</I>&gt;<i> * It's a professional organization.  One of the benefits of professional
</I>&gt;<i> organizations is professional networking (who you know)
</I>&gt;<i> * Many of our members are college students who might be looking for a job
</I>&gt;<i> lead
</I>&gt;<i> * This particular one has been vetted - i.e., it wasn't just a recruiter
</I>&gt;<i> calling on a whim - so there's some &quot;quality control&quot; to the post before it
</I>&gt;<i> goes out
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand:
</I>&gt;<i> * Is this going to open the floodgates of spam on our local mailing list?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had seen in the past there was some discussion about possibly setting up
</I>&gt;<i> forum software for OWASP.  If this was there, we could at least put job
</I>&gt;<i> leads or postings into another category so that those interested could look
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does the leadership have any thoughts on this?  What has worked in other
</I>&gt;<i> chapters?  I'm assuming we need to police ourselves on this, act
</I>&gt;<i> responsibly, etc., but was hoping to see that other chapters have crossed
</I>&gt;<i> this bridge and found a good way to handle it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we have our meetings, I tend to have a slide show on rotation of
</I>&gt;<i> upcoming events (next meeting, local conferences, AppSec USA, etc.) that
</I>&gt;<i> show during the meet-and-greet.  We may include more &quot;quality&quot; leads like
</I>&gt;<i> this (or &quot;see Bob for local job announcements&quot; or something) - but with our
</I>&gt;<i> meetings being once a quarter or so right now, a few might slip through the
</I>&gt;<i> cracks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Will Stranathan
