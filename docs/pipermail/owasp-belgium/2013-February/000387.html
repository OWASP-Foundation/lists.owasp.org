Bio:

Lars Ewe runs Engineering at Click Security. He joined Click from

responsible for NI's overall product security efforts. Prior to NI, Lars

Abstract:

By now pretty much everyone has heard of &quot;big data&quot;, right? If not,
here's Wikipedia's short summary: &quot;big data is a collection of data sets
so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand
database management tools or traditional data processing applications.&quot;
Did you ever wonder how big data affects security? Or why the &quot;bad guys&quot;
are still winning? The industry invests large amounts of money and
energy in protecting assets via the use of firewalls, WAF, IDS/IPS, AV,
etc., but is it really working? Come and join Lars Ewe, VP of
Engineering at Click Security, a leader in the big data real-time
security analytics (RtSA) space, to learn more about how big data RtSA
can help you catch the &quot;bad guys&quot; by better leveraging your existing
security infrastructure investments.
