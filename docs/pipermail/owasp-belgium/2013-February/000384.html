<PRE>Dear all,

We are pleased to announce SecAppDev Leuven 2013, an intensive one-week
course in secure application development. The course is organized by
secappdev.org, a non-profit organization that aims to broaden security
awareness in the development community and advance secure software
engineering practices. The course is a joint initiative with KU Leuven
and Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management.

SecAppDev 2013 is the 9th edition of our widely acclaimed course,
attended by an international audience from a broad range of industries
including financial services, telecom, consumer electronics and media
and taught by leading software security experts including

+ Prof. dr. ir. Bart Preneel who heads COSIC, the renowned crypto lab.
+ Ken van Wyk, co-founder of the CERT Coordination Center and widely
   acclaimed author and lecturer.
+ Dr. Steven Murdoch of the University of Cambridge Computer
   Laboratory's security group, well known for his research in
   anonymity and banking system security.
+ Jim Manico, an OWASP board member.
+ John Steven, a sought-after architect for high-performance, scalable
   JEE systems.
+ Prof. dr. ir. Frank Piessens who pioneered application security
   teaching at university level.
+ Dr. Mart&#237;n Ochoa works as a security researcher for Siemens.
+ ir. Thomas Herlea is an IT security consultant specialised in
   software security.
+ Dr. Graham Steel is one of the world's foremost authorities on
   security APIs.
+ Prof. dr. Tom Van Cutsem takes an active role in JavaScript
   standardization.

When we ran our first annual course in 2005, emphasis was on awareness
and security basics, but as the field matured and a thriving security
training market developed, we felt it was not appropriate to compete
as a non-profit organization. Our focus has hence shifted to providing
a platform for leading-edge and experimental material from thought
leaders in academia and industry. We look toward academics to provide
research results that are ready to break into the mainstream and
attract people with an industrial background to try out new content
and formats.

The course takes place from March 4th to 8th in the Faculty Club,
Leuven, Belgium.

For more information visit the web site: <A HREF="http://secappdev.org.">http://secappdev.org.</A>

Places are limited, so do not delay registering to avoid
disappointment. Registration is on a first-come, first-served basis.
Alumni, public servants and independents receive a 50% discount.
A 10% discount is available to paid-up OWASP members.

I hope that we will be able to welcome you or your colleagues to our
course.

Kind regards,

Lieven
