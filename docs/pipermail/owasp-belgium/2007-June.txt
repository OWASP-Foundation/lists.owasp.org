Buffer Overflows on .Net and Asp.Net
One of the common myths about the .Net Framework is that it is immune to
Buffer Overflows. Although this might be correct in pure managed and
verifiable .Net code, large percentage of .Net and Asp.Net applications code
is unmanaged code. In this talk Dinis will show the areas in .Net and
Asp.Net applications that are vulnerable to Buffer Overflows (including the
demo of a .Net Buffer Overflow Fuzzer). 

ABOUT THE PRESENTERS

Ivan Ristic is the creator of  <http://www.modsecurity.org/> ModSecurity (an
open source web application firewall and intrusion detection/prevention
engine). Ivan also wrote Apache Security for O'Reilly, a web security guide
for administrators, system architects, and programmers. For more info, see
Anurag Agarwal's
<http://myappsecurity.blogspot.com/2007/03/reflection-on-ivan-ristic.html>
reflection on Ivan Ristic.

Dinis Cruz is a renowned application security expert who is passionate about
training developers to move beyond the `comfort zone' of standard ASP.NET
development and into the world of advanced security aware development with
the aim of making the Web Applications as secure as possible against malware
and malicious hackers. Dinis is also the project leader for the OWASP .Net
Project and the and the main developer of several of OWASP .Net tools
(SAM'SHE, ANBS, SiteGenerator, PenTest Reporter, ASP.Net Reflector, Online
IIS Metabase Explorer). author of many Open Source security tools (see
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/.Net> http://www.owasp.org/index.php/.Net). 

WHO should attend? 

Anyone interested in Web Application Security (management, security
professionals, developers, students, etc). OWASP Belgium/Luxemburg chapter
membership is free. All meetings are free. There are never vendor pitches or
sales presentations at OWASP meetings. Check our chapter page
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Belgium>

 <http://www.owasp.org/> 

Dear ISSA-BE Member, 
Dear Security Professional, 

The ISSA Brussels-European Chapter is proud to announce its Security Event
for the month of June 2007! 

The originally planned event for June ("Social Engineering") had to be
rescheduled but luckily we found two other very interesting topics +
presenters and another venue just in time! 

 

"ISSA-BE IT Security event June 2007." 


Part 1 : "Information Security Intelligence"

"Knowledge is power". It's the motto all "Intelligence Agencies" around the
world live by. "Intelligence" could be described as "the process of
gathering, evaluating, correlating and interpreting of information, and
disseminating it to the decision makers." As a result, it reduces
uncertainty in the decisionmaking process. Which is something every "boss"
appreciates. To some degree, everybody in every organisation does this, but
we could do a lot better, and this presentation by Maarten Van Horenbeeck
from Cybertrust will show you the way! 

 

Part 2 : "Using the Windows UserAssist registry keys for forensic analysis"

An incredible amount of data is being stored into the Microsoft Windows
Registry database. A whole lot of it is being documented in official
Microsoft documents, but not everything... But if one has a truely
inquisitive mindset like Didier Stevens from Contraste Europe has, one is
bound to find some very interesting needles is this haystack!  

 

This evening event will be held on


Monday June 18th, 2007 

 

Agenda :

1800h : Welcome 

1830h : " Information Security Intelligence"  by Mr Maarten Van Horenbeeck,
Security Consultant at Cybertrust

1930h : short break 

1945h : "Using the Windows UserAssist registry keys for forensic analysis"
by Mr Didier Stevens, Security Consultant at Contraste Europe 

2045h : closing drink 

This event is sponsored by and will be held in the Auditorium of Cybertrust,
Ubicenter, Philipssite 5, B-3001 Leuven. 

A detailed roadmap and driving instructions can be found on
<http://www.ubizen.com/c_about_us/1_company/_itineraries/ubizen_hqemea.pdf>
http://www.ubizen.com/c_about_us/1_company/_itineraries/ubizen_hqemea.pdf 

PLEASE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE FREE PARKING TICKET BEING MENTIONED IS NOT
APPLICABLE TO THIS EVENT!


Registration for the event is free but mandatory. In case there would be
more registrations than available seats, ISSA members in good standing and
trial members will be favoured over other people in a ratio of 70%
(trial-)members to 30% non-members. Early registrants will have precedence
over late registrants. Registration starts as of June 11th. Members as well
as non-members register by e-mailing their contact details to
register at issa-be.org  mentioning "ISSA June 2007 Security Event
Registration" in the subject line. 

Free trial memberships can be set up through
<http://www.issa.org/join.html> http://www.issa.org/join.html - don't forget
to choose "Brussels European" as Chapter Affiliation! 

SPEAKERS' BIO'S AND ABSTRACTS OF THE PRESENTATIONS :

Maarten Van Horenbeeck, Security Consultant at Cybertrust

bio : 
As a security consultant, Maarten Van Horenbeeck is active within
Cybertrust, providing services that secure critical data, protect identities
and help customers demonstrate ongoing compliance. He has an academic
background in information security and intelligence and has experience in
risk management and threat assessment as well as the deployment and
management of security monitoring frameworks. 
Prior to his current role, he was a senior security analyst and subsequently
service delivery manager in the Managed Security Services group of
Cybertrust. 

Maarten is also an incident handler with the SANS Internet Storm Center. 

 

abstract : "Information Security Intelligence

The threat landscape has seen some drastic changes over the last few years.
The fading perimeter, format rendering vulnerabilities and targeted attacks
have all changed the way we deal with technical controls and how we choose 
to mitigate risk. Organizations are having a hard time dealing with these
new threats, and are increasingly looking to formal security intelligence
processes for assistance. Maarten will introduce the intelligence principles

that underlie the way we deal with security information, apply them to a
number of recent security incidents, and show how they can be and are being
used by organizations and security vendors to more effectively deal with 
threats to information security.

Mr Didier Stevens, Security Consultant at Contraste Europe 

Didier Stevens (CISSP, MCSD .NET, MCSE/Security) is an IT Security
Consultant currently working at a large Belgian financial corporation. He is
employed by Contraste Europe NV, an IT Consulting Services company. (note
from Tomas : "His blog and his IT Security Research and Open Source tools
are renown around the world, but he is Mr Modesty in person!") 

abstract : 

Windows XP (and later Windows versions) keeps a list of all programs
executed by a user. This list is kept in the registry (UserAssist keys). For
each executed program, a running counter and a timestamp is maintained. 
The data in the UserAssist registry keys is used by Windows to display the
Most Frequently Used Programs list on the start menu, but it can also be
used to analyse which programs a user has executed.
Exploiting these keys for forensic analysis is a little known technique,
because there is no publicly available official documentation from Microsoft
about these registry keys. This presentation will detail Didier's findings
and the use of the Open Source tool he wrote specifically to reveal this
info in a userfriendly way. 

 

We hope to see you on this very interesting security event! 

High Regards 
Tomas Vanhoof 
2006 Education & General Events Officer of the ISSA Brussels-European
Chapter 

 

The ISSA-BE chapter is sponsored by Consul, Cybertrust and Qualis.

Hi,

I've read Hillar Leoste will update us on  .be domain website defacements 
this afternoon.
I posted an article on a XSS vulnerability I found on a .be domain 
website.
It's not a real big hack and it's definately not a defacement, but it's 
kind of funny:)
