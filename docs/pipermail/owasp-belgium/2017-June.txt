   - 19h45 - 20h30: '*Threat modeling lessons from Star Wars* (by Adam
   Shostack, freelance security consultant)

*Abstract:* Everyone knows you ought to threat model, but in practical
reality it turns out to be tricky. If past efforts to threat model haven't
panned out, perhaps part of the problem is confusion over what works, and
how the various approaches conflict or align. This talk captures lessons
from years of work helping people throughout the software industry threat
model more effectively. It's designed to help security pros, developers and
systems managers, all of whom will leave with both threat modeling lessons
from Star Wars and a proven foundation, enabling them to threat model
effectively.*Bio:* Adam is a consultant, entrepreneur, technologist, author
and game designer. He's a member of the BlackHat Review Board, and helped
found the CVE and many other things. He's currently helping a variety of
organizations improve their security, and advising and mentoring startups
as a Mach37 Star Mentor. While at Microsoft, he drove the Autorun fix into
Windows Update, was the lead designer of the SDL Threat Modeling Tool v3
and created the "Elevation of Privilege" game. Adam is the author of
"Threat Modeling: Designing for Security," and the co-author of "The New
School of Information Security."
