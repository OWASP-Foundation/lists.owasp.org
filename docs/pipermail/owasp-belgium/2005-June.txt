Dear list,
 
For you who did not subscribe in time to get the presentations:
It will take some time to post the presentations on the OWASP web site
due to a-not-so-easy editor interface, resulting in me having to ask the
owasp admin to put them online.
 
I'll send a notice to the list when the presentations are available
online.

Hi all, 
I will be off (far far away) that week, so not interested into that
event, but if some of you are willing to attend, I can confirm that LA
(and Caesar's Palace in particular) is a unique experience, even if you
do not bet a penny, like me ! it is vacation time, after all.
Also plan to go to Death Valley - 1 (big) day go & return by car - it is
really great !
Grand Canyon is of course a must, but you need more time (400 miles).
Nice to see as well, and not too far: Hoover Lake and its Dam -
impressive.

Cheers,

Hi list,

To: OWASP WebScarab; OWASP Leaders
Subject: [OWASP-WEBSCARAB] New release of WebScarab

Hi folks,

This is to announce that a new release of WebScarab has been uploaded to
Sourceforge.

<https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id
=61823>

This is a major improvement, with 3 new plugins:

* Fuzzer (at LAST!)
* Search
* Compare

Fuzzer

The fuzzer basically allows you to throw a combination of values at a
server. It is still a little rough, but functionally, it works pretty
well. The idea is that you configure the request method, the basic URL
(without any parameters), the request version, any headers (e.g. a Host:

header if you are using HTTP/1.1, etc. Don't configure cookies here!),
and a list of Parameters.

A Parameter is defined by its location (Path, Fragment, Query, Cookie,
Body), its name (ignored for Path), type == String, Default value, Fuzz
Priority, and a fuzz source.

The default value is the value that will be submitted if no fuzz source
is defined.

The fuzz priority defines how the various fuzz sources are combined: if
all the priorities are the same value, the number of queries submitted
will be the number of items in the shortest fuzz source. If they are
different values, the number of queries generated will be the product of
the number of items in each level.

An example would be if you had a list of usernames and passwords. If
both username and password parameters had the same priority, usernames
and passwords would be consumed in lock-step. If they had different
priorities, EVERY password would be tried for each username.

Parameters are processed in order, first path, then fragment, then
query, then cookie, then body. The only content type supported for POST
Requests is application/x-www-urlencoded, it does not support multi-part
(although provision is made for parameters of different types, e.g. 
File), or XML documents, etc. Multi-part and XML will be the next
evolution.

Search

The search plugin allows you to execute arbitrary beanshell scripts to
identify "interesting" conversations. You are provided with the request,
response, and origin (originating plugin) of the conversation, and can
use the class methods to return a true or false value. A true value
indicates an interesting conversation that should be displayed, and a
false value indicates that the conversation should not be displayed.

An example might be something like:

response.getContent() != null && new
String(response.getContent()).matches("(?s).*[Ee](rror|xception).*")

which makes sure that the response HAS content (byte[]), before checking
to see if a String constructed from that content contains any of the
strings: Error, error, Exception, exception. The (?s) instructs the Java
Regex algorithm to perform a multi-line match, i.e. enables the period
to match a linefeed character.

BeanShell also does automatic JavaBean introspection, so in fact, the
call to response.getContent() could also be written as
"response.content", with BeanShell using the getters and setters
appropriately.

For details of the class methods available, please consult the JavaDocs
(included in the installer build) for
org.owasp.webscarab.model.(Request|Response). Origin is simply a String
matching the plugin name.

Compare

This plugin takes a "base conversation" selected from the drop down
list, tokenizes it into words, and then executes a Levenshtein Edit
Distance algorithm on the results. The Distance figure calculated is
thus the number of words which should be added/changed/removed to
transform the "base conversation" into the relevant conversation in the
table. Selecting a conversation in the table will show both responses
side by side, for visual inspection. If anyone knows of a nice
embeddable Java "diff viewer component", under the GPL or LGPL, please
let me know. Ideally, it should highlight the places that differ, which
this plugin currently does not do.

There are various other improvements, such as the ability to prevent
conversations from being added to the list, or being analysed by the
various plugins. This is implemented in the form of a Scripting Hook,
accessible via Tools -> Script Manager.

e.g: The following snippet prevents images and css resources from being
added to the conversation list.

request = conversation.getRequest();
url = request.getURL().toString();
if (url.matches("($i).*\.(gif|jpg|css)$"))
     conversation.setCancelled(true);

If you have any trouble with this new release, or any comments/feature
requests, etc, please mail the webscarab mailing list: 
owasp-webscarab at lists.sourceforge.net

Have fun with it!

Rogan

Morning all,

Sorry for the short break in the testing guide progress, the real world
caught up with me.
Attached are the documents needed for the next part of the guide, and
they are:

Testing Guide II Structure.doc

This is the final TOC as we agreed and next to each section, there is
the option to add your name and your e-mail address(i.e you will be
writing this section)

template1.htm

If you could structure all your submissions using this template (you can
use any format you like, word/text/xml, as long as i can read it on a
mac!)

Guidelines for creating sections:

- DO NOT DO A STRAIGHT COPY FROM ANY OTHER SOURCES ON THE WEB!
Plagiarism won't be accepted.
This testing guide should reflect the experience you all have in
application testing. One of the benefits of OWASP is that the wealth of
experience from the contributors enables the reader to understand the
section they are reading, as it is presented in a well structured
format, which unlike a large amount of research papers on the web today,
isn't normally the case.

- Try and use examples where possible and also let other "non- security"
individuals read what you have written. This ensures that it makes sense
to everyone and not just the hardcore penetration testers out there.

- I understand everyone has a life and work commitments, so please don't
select loads of sections if you know you may not be able to commit to
them in the end run.

- Contact me if you have any issues during this next phase


I think we should aim to have all the sections written by mid August,
how does this sound for everyone?

Obviously if you feel there is a section missing from the TOC, by all
means contact me

Look forward to seeing the work coming in

Daniel Cuthbert

Hi Sebastien, 
 
Theory on practices, techniques etc.. may appear as "deja vu" for
experts, while difficult to catch for newbies (we all know conferences
where you sleep half of the time, or do not get a piece of it he other
time).
But I think that practical case studies where the lecturer can explain
what (s)he lived "with guts", has always an added value for everyone. So
I suggest the following generic agenda:
 
- one/more intro-level topic 
- one/more experienced-level topic (see L-sec, etc..)
- one/more real-live cases
 
depending on speakers availability, etc...
 
See you next time,
