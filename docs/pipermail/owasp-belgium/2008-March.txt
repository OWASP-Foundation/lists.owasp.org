Hi,

 

We are having a problem on finding a good location for the EU conference.
Some locations we aimed for are not available anymore, others are to
expensive.

 

Does somebody on the list have contacts at the ULB where the Fosdem
http://www.fosdem.org/2008/practical/transportation event was organised?

 

Any other input for a possible location where we can organise the 2 track
conference on May 22-23 (estimate 100 to 400 people) in or near Brussels
would be most welcome!

I am thinking of government, banks, .... ?

 

Thank you for your help!

I have those contacts at the ULB.
I will poke them to ask them if it's possible to organise the event 
there. But note that currently the ULB policy has changed since a few 
years and that they charge some money for using the rooms. It is also not 
easy to get rooms on saturday mornging (till 1300) because teachers 
always have priority.

What kind of exact logistics do you need? Two rooms of approx 200-300 
seats each, some other rooms for sponsor stands? Place with refreshments? 
Staff that manages the food/drinks? Or do you handle finding a catering 
service? ... Please send me this info asap by mail.
Once I know this I'll poke my ULB contacts.

be there the second day but currently I'm not really familiar with the

Hi All,

I'm a student in computer science at ULB. I'll finish my study in june 2008. I hesitate between becoming a security engineer and a software engineer. As I am interested in both domains, the main criteria for comparison is salary .

Could you tell me how much (just an estimation) a security earn per month in Belgian market (gross salary) ?
What is the salary evolution (in four, five years) ?

Thanks in advance for advices.

Regards,

Xavier.

Together we can accomplish something really amazing with this money, but we
need people to read the RFPs

Hi leaders,

 

As you know, a fortnight ago I've sent you all the email below asking for
help in order to advertise the OWASP
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Press_Release>
Summer of Code 2008. Unfortunately, I haven't received any answers which I
understood perfectly as you all certainly have loads of work to do and much
more interesting things to think about.  Therefore, I've assumed this task
on my own and I took a stab at trying to draw attention to this new season
of code. To do so, I've used the email list that I am sending in attach and
I just achieve these poor results <http://owaspsoc2008.wordpress.com/> . 

 

Due to that, I felt forced to chase you once again. I need to ask one more
time either for media/press email addresses or for you to send directly the
press
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Press_Release>
release to whom you find appropriate. Could you please help me out? Please
forgive my insistence - I thank you in advance. In my opinion, the SoC 2008
brings about a good opportunity to advertise the work that we all are trying
to do and it would be a drawback to waste it. 

 

Best regards,
