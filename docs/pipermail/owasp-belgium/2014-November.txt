Dear,

Apologies for the late heads-up, but we want to inform you that the planned
OWASP BeNeLux 2014 in Luxembourg is rescheduled to next year.

The main reason is that the whole team is working hard on preparing AppSec
Europe Research 2015 in Amsterdam next year.
More information is available on appsec.eu

Kind regards,

OWASP BeNeLux Team
Seba
