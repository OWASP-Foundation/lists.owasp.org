ASP.NETApplication Security, Active Directory deployments, Application
Security
audits and .NET Security Curriculum Development. Dinis is also Chief OWASP
Evangelist!

   - 20h00 - 21h00: *Logging: not just a good idea* (by Eddy Vanlerberghe)

*Presentation + discussion:* During the design and implementation of
applications, logging is often not considered to be a vital factor in the
overall security, but merely one of the tools of the trade used by
developers so that runtime errors can easily be traced to their root cause
in the application source. As a result, lack of decent security logs usually
becomes clear when they are needed the most: when an incident has occurred.
Incidents where logging plays a crucial role could be disputes over whether
or not a customer issued a certain transaction (non-repudiation), intruders
have compromised bank accounts (forensic investigation) or even foil an
ongoing attack when suspicious traffic is being registered (e.g. lock out IP
addresses of suspected attackers) This presentation will handle different
aspects of what constitutes secure application logging: what to log, when to
log, access to log information etc. *Eddy Vanlerberghe* has extensive
experience as a developer. He has been involved in development of commercial
Internet Web applications since 1996. In 1999 he joined the company
Netvision, which was first renamed to Ubizen and even later the company
became Cybertrust. In 2007 the company was acquired by VerizonBusiness. Mr.
Vanlerberghe was part of the development teams for security related products
like ETS Multisecure, EasyPayment and the web application level firewall
DMZShield. Since 2005 he has been part of the Application Security team
where he was involved in all aspects of application security.  REGISTRATION

Please *send a mail* to Belgium 'at' owasp.org if you plan to attend, so we
can size the venue appropriately and keep you updated on last-minute
changes.

Seba
