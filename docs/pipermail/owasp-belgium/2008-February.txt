During the SecAppDev (http://www.secappdev.org) class next month in
Leuven, Belgium, there's also going to be a regional OWASP meeting.
I've been asked to join in and present a short session comparing
various secure development methodologies (Microsoft's SDL, Cigital's
"Touchpoints", and OWASP's own CLASP, mainly).  If you're in the area,
I hope you'll join us.  Local details are available on OWASP's site at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Belgium
.

While I'm there, I'll also be doing a CAcert/Thawte x.509 "signing".
So, if you're using either of these free x.509 certificate services,
and are still trying to get the 50 assurance points necessary to have
your real name on your certificates, stop by with two forms of
government-issued ID (and photocopies, if using Thawte -- not
necessary for CAcert).  I'll be happy to help out with either/both 10
Thawte points or 35 CAcert points.  No charge, of course.

Cheers,

Ken

Subject: [Owasp-leaders] OWASP's new Project Manager + OWASP Summer of
Code2008 + OWASP's Project Assessment Criteria

 

 

Hello everyone,

 

I wanted to introduce myself to one and all as OWASP's new Project Manager.


 

As some of you already know, I began working with OWASP part-time last year
as the SpoC's 07 Project Manager. 

 

Recently my relationship with OWASP has changed. We've agreed I'll be
working part-time until next June. After that, I'll assume the job on a full
time basis.

 

It is with great enthusiasm that I accepted this job. I will do my best to
live up to the trust that you have placed in me. 

 

As OWASP's Project Manager, here's an idea of my short-term work plans:

 

1 - To launch and manage the new season of code - OWASP Summer of Code 2008.

2 - To contribute to and stabilize OWASP's new Project Assessment Criteria. 

3 - To contribute to the assessment, and re-assessment, of all OWASP
projects.

4 - To build and maintain a wiki page with the status of all OWASP projects
and their assessments.

5 - To welcome new developers who are interested in joining OWASP community.

6 - To help project leaders and participants with their projects in any way
that I can.

 

I take this opportunity to say that your comments on
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008> OWASP Summer of
Code 2008 would certainly be very useful. In addition, we are also
interested in your opinions about the
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project_Assessment> OWASP's
Project Assessment Criteria. 

 

To summarize, I am very pleased about the prospect of contributing to the
achievements of this organization and look forward to this new phase of our
relationship. However, I know that my performance will depend on your
feedback. So, I am counting on it and I thank you all in advance.

 

Best regards,

 

Paulo Coimbra

OWASP Project Manager
