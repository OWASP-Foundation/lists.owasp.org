Dear Hacking-Lab & OWASP User,

the 4'th challenge to win a ticket is now open.


Countdown Challenges -- Win Free Tickets to AppSec EU Research 2013 in
Hamburg!


The OWASP German Chapter will host the OWASP AppSec Europe Research 2013
global conference in Hamburg, Germany from August 20-23. The event will be
composed of 2 days of training (August 20-21), followed by 2 days of
conference talks (August 22-23). The conference is expected to draw 400-500
technologists from Research, Government, Financial Services, Media,
Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare, Technology and many other verticals.

Visit the conference page
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2013 for details.

There will be a challenge posted on the conference wiki page every month up
until the event in August. The winner of each challenge will get free
entrance to the conference, worth about ?420. Be sure to sign up for the
conference mailing list
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013  to get a monthly
reminder.


The first challenge with OWASP AppSec EU Research is history! The first
challenge is now closed. But wait, we have opened the second challenge as
part of this series today.


The 4'th challenge starts here
=================================


https://www.hacking-lab.com/events/registerform.html?eventid=444&uk=fxmycgUCHheeKvhUJs5aAYT8zfspa7yH

    The challenge will be open until 12th of June 2013.


How to Win
=================================

Each challenge will be announced on the conference wiki page and the
conference mailing list

        https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013

Simply follow the link, login, and follow the instructions for the
challenge. Provide your solution, which then will be marked. The challenge
will be opened right after the announcement and will be closed 4 weeks
later. The winner will be rewarded a free conference ticket 3 days later.

The organizing committee will review the provided solutions and accept or
reject it. While the challenge is open, rejected solutions can be enhanced
and submitted again. If there are equal solutions at the end of the
challenge, the first submitted one wins.

At end of the last challenge, right before the conference starts,
additional tickets will be given to the best provided solutions over all
submitted solutions.

The free ticket is personal and the judgement of the organizing committee
can not be overruled.

(Existing Hacking-Lab Account)"), or to sign-up (see "Sign-up a new
Hacking-Lab Account") if you don't have a login. You may use your existing
account, or sign-up for a new one.

To participate on the challenge, you need an account at Hacking-Lab. You
just need an email address for that and you can use a nickname of your
choice. Only the nickname will be public.
