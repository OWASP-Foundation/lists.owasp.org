Vulnerability:* Insecure Direct Object Reference is when a web application
exposes an internal implementation object to the user. Some examples of
internal implementation objects are database records, URLs, or files.
*Attack:* An attacker can modify the internal implementation object in an
attempt to abuse the access controls on this object. When the attacker does
this they may have the ability to access functionality that the developer
didn?t intend to expose access to.
*Countermeasure:* Reference should be validated for authorization and
accessed through reference maps. How this should be done will be shown.

*See the flyer attached! Registration via email to: netherlands at owasp.org*

Looking forward welcome Thursday!

Cheers,
Martin Knobloch (OWASP Netherlands)

Hi,

OWASP will have a booth at the Infosecurity.be 2010 event.
If you plan to come and have a couple of hours to help us man the
booth: contact seba at owasp.org.

If you are around: visit us and have a chat!

See you there,

Seba & OWASP BE board

Below is the invitation for Infosecurity.be 2010
================================================================================================

Trade show Infosecurity.be, 24 & 25 March Brussels Expo, offers IT
professionals an overview of the latest security technologies,
products and services. With a wide range of exhibitors, keynote
sessions, comprehensive seminar programme and other activities the
show offers a great deal of inspiration for all your security issues.

Keynote speakers
The seminars are divided into management sessions and technical
sessions. Seminars by keynote speakers are: ?Data Security Breaches:
An Unstoppable Epidemic?? by Eugene Schultz (Emagined Security), ?Data
Leakage Prevention: When data goes up and out? by No?l van den
Driessche (KBC Group) and ?Threat Landscape 2010: Evolution or
Revolution?? by Maksym Schipka (Kaspersky Lab). Schipka is a
widely-known security expert and one of the issues that he will
highlight is the need for a common understanding that organisations
have to focus a lot more on prevention when it comes to data security.
Schipka: ?When you approach data security in a proactive way then
eventually money will be saved and data will be secured.?

Professional Development Caf?
One of the keynote activities is the Professional Development Caf?.
Infosecurity.be and (ISC)2 invite visitors to round table discussions
and small groups discussions on professional development. Each 40
minute session will offer practical insight and current research into
changing demands on the profession and the skills required to meet
them.

Infosecurity.be will also have some fascinating Case Studies, where
exhibitors show their solutions to your security problems. The show
takes place at the same time as the trade show Storage Expo BE (data
storage and management). A unique one-stop shopping opportunity: with
just one visit, you can kill two birds with one stone!

*Title:*
The Frogs Who Desired A King: A Virtualization and Cloud Computing Security
Fable Set To Interpretive Dance

*Description:*
Aesop wrote a little ditty about some discontented frogs who lived in a
pond. They asked Zeus for a new King. They got one. It ate them. The moral
of this story is "be careful what you wish for as you might just get it."

The corresponding analog is that of virtualization and cloud security. It's
coming, but it's not going to look much like what security looks like today
and it's certainly not what people are expecting.

On the one hand, it may consume us all because we're unprepared for what
we're asking for whilst on the other hand it's a platform change we'll adapt
to without much fuss.

We'll discuss the realities of both virtualization and Cloud Computing
security and how to deal with the things that don't change and also the
things that do profoundly.

*Bio *:

Chris is Director of Cloud & Virtualization Solutions at Cisco Systems where
he focuses on virtualization and cloud computing security, spending most of
his time interacting with global enterprises and service providers,
governments, and the defense and intelligence communities.

Previously, he was Unisys Corporation's Chief Security Architect, served as
Crossbeam Systems' chief security strategist, was the CISO and director of
enterprise security at WesCorp, a $25 billion financial services company and
was founder/CTO of a national security consultancy.
Chris specializes in emerging and disruptive innovation and what it means to
security, and is technical advisor to the Cloud Security Alliance. Chris
blogs at http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog

*Some other interesting info about him :*

- Winner of the 2010 RSA Security Bloggers Awards in the category of ?Most
Entertaining blog? (entertaining AND content-rich AND thought-provoking -
just check it out yourself at
http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?tag=cloud-security )
- he is probably the only Director of a multinational organization that has
more and bigger tattoos than the above-average rockstar (except maybe
organized crime, now that I think of it)
- he is one of the people that are defining our industry

Hi,

Eric is organizing the SANS SEC 560 "Network Penetration Testing and Ethical
Hacking" in Diegem and is looking for people to participate. OWASP contacts
get a 10% discount by using the "SecOrg" code. Details below.

regards

Seba

PS: SANS is not OWASP, but we do support local initiatives to increase
security awareness and knowlegde. Let us know if you want to receive notice
of similar events?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Sir/Madam

Togheter with the SANS Institute, I will be organizing the SEC560: Network
Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking course in mentor style in Brussels.
The course will be held at Ernst & Young's premises in Diegem, each tuesday
from 18.00 until 21.00 starting on April 20th and ending on June 22th. The
SANS mentor program is designed to guide the students through the course
content in ten consecutive sessions, where in each lessen the mentor will
walk through the difficult sections of the course, provide hands-on
excerises and experience, and if there is some time left, demo some
cutting-edge penetration testing techniques. This style is perfect for
students who can not spend a whole week at one of the SANS conference in
Europe but who can dedicate some time for preparing the class through
self-study. All students will receive the official SEC560 course books from
SANS and access to MP3 recordings of the official SANS class.

If you know anyone of our colleagues or professional contacts who could be
interested, please feel free to forward this email. More information on the
course can be found here below:
*
Course Content*
Successful penetration testers don't just throw a bunch of hacks against an
organization and regurgitate the output of their tools. Instead, they need
to understand how these tools work indepth, and conduct their test in a
careful, professional manner. This course explains the inner workings of
numerous tools and their use in effective network penetration testing and
ethical hacking projects. More information on the SANS SEC 560 course can be
found at *http://www.sans.org/security-training/description.php?tid=1717*<http://www.sans.org/security-training/description.php?tid=1717>
.

The SANS Mentor program is a self-study learning experience. Students will
work independently at their own pace, and are expected to read the course
books and any study materials provided -- prior to attending the Mentor-led
sessions.
*
Mentor Biography*
Erik has been working for Ernst & Young?s Financial Service organisation for
the last two years, under supervision of Pieter Danhieux, who is one of
SANS's official instructors in Europe for the SEC560 course. Erik is
dedicated to IT Security projects, including  network and web application
penetration testing for large financial institutions. In order to keep his
knowledge at the cutting-edge, he travels around Europe attending hacking
courses and conferences such as SANS, BruCON, CCC and Hacking at Random. He
is also one of the main developers of The Hex Factor hacking challenge,
which runs each year on conferences such as BruCON in Belgium and SANS
London.
