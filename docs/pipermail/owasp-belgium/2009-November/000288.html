 Announcing LSEC December Activities :
Identity, Data Loss, Security Virtualisation



*Reserve your agenda for the following upcoming LSEC events in December 2009
*



In December, LSEC are planning a number of Information Security activities
that require your attendance. With the year 2009 coming to a close, December
will be a good time to evaluate 2009 and discuss some of the most important
evolutions on Identity and Access Management, Data Protection, Data Breach
and Retention, Virtualization Security, Security Virtualization and Security
in the Cloud.




Evolutions of Access Control and Identity Management

Leuven, December 3 - 4 : Security Conference 2009 : Present and Future of
IAM
10 - 17h

A two day conference on the Present and Future of Access Control, IAM and
Identity Management : Identity and Access Management, Identity Lifecycle
management, Single Sign On, eID developments, Physical and Logical Access
Control, Federated Identities, Multi-factor Authentication, &#8230; :
presentations, customer cases, technology focus, market developments, panel
discussions, &#8230;

Governance, Risk and Compliance continue to be the main drivers for Identity
and Access Management installations and services, according to a recent
survey by KPMG and Everett. Some of these projects are becoming increasingly
of strategic importance to many companies, not only to be able to control
the identities, but increasingly to facilitate all sorts of activities.
During this two-day conference, we aim to bring together most of the
important players and projects from 2009 and try to present a glimpse on the
next year in terms of IAM activities.

Data Protection 2009 : changing evolutions and local impact

Leuven, December 8th : Data Breach, Data Protection, Data Retention : LSEC
DLP 2009
10 - 18h

In 2009, the discussion on data breaches and loss of data was clearly
overshadowed by the economic turmoil and the financial crisis. According to
the recent studies by Verizon Business indicated that there were more than
285 million records breached in 2008. In 2009, the expectation is that there
will be many more for a number of reasons : more data breaches were reported
(both willingly and required by law or regulations; more regulatory bodies
require companies to notify data breach and more people had a reason to take
along data from their employers (because of the number of failing companies
and people being laid down).

Also in 2009 Data Protection remained a key driver for companies to manage
Governance, Risk and Compliance. Not only the fact that data increasingly
have to be protected by law and regulations, there is also the fact that
companies have to be able to present proof of this protection. Audit and ICT
Control are playing an increasingly important role in organizations
processing large volumes of critical data. At the same time, there is an
increasing requirement and interest in protecting people&#8217;s privacy. With an
increasing number of services being executed in the cloud, and personal data
being transmitted cross-border, local Data Protection Agencies (DPA) are
considering new challenges for companies from abroad. Data Protection has
become a strategic challenge for many companies.

 Have you ever been Hyperjacked ? Recently found a Botnet in your Cloud?

Leuven, December 10th : Virtualization Security, Security Virtualization and
Security In the Cloud.
10 - 17h

Earlier this year, LSEC organized a seminar on some of the Security aspects
of Virtualization and Cloud Computing. During that seminar, an outline was
presented on current threats, potential solutions and future evolutions. The
current business drive on virtualization and cloud computing and the
evolution of threats in the cloud, make this topic more than ever important
for businesses, organisations and administrations working on or towards
Virtualization.

Not yet aware about Hyperjacking, or you don&#8217;t know how to run Botnets in
the Cloud? We plan to revisit some of the potential threats posed by the use
of Hypervisors, Virtual Machines on multiple OS or even running a variety of
Virtual Machines on a multitude of physical servers, Did you realize that
physically moving a VM from one machine to another, is actually done in the
clear?
How easy would it be within your organization to walk in with a USB-stick
running a VM, copying all of the VM&#8217;s active and re-running their states
somewhere else to find out your weaknesses?
How do you realize patch management in VM&#8217;s that have been online for a
while, but could resurface with potential threats in them? How do you plan
to control your ICT-environment, with this Virtual environment? What are
your rights when a government enforcement groups hijacks your physical and
virtual machines? The challenges are omnivalent and complex. Solutions are
non-existent, or just barely surfacing.
