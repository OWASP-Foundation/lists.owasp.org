<PRE>FYI

 

Dear,

 

I would like to invite you to the next OWASP Belgium/Luxemburg Chapter
meeting!

 

We have an additional speaker: Hillar from Zone-H will provide us with an
update on defacements in the BE domain for last year.

Also a more detailed abstract is available for Lieven's presentation.

 

Please send a mail to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-belgium">seba at deleersnyder.eu</A> to register by Monday evening, 

so we can size the venue appropriately and keep you updated on last-minute
changes.

 

WHAT
The Open Web Application Security Project ( &lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/">http://www.owasp.org/</A>&gt;
www.owasp.org) Belgium/Luxemburg Chapter organizes their next Chapter
meeting.

OWASP's all-volunteer participants produce free, professional quality,
open-source documentation, tools, and standards on application security. 

An example of this is the famous OWASP top ten of most critical web
application security flaws. 

The OWASP community facilitates conferences, local chapters, articles, and
message forums.

Participation in OWASP is free and open to all, as are all the materials we
produce.

 

WHEN
Thursday 10th of May 2007, 18h00 - 21h15

&quot;Legal Aspects of (Web) Application Security&quot;: Presentation + Discussion

Jos Dumortier will discuss important questions such as:

*          How far can you go if you want to 'test' the security of a web
site? 

*          How much application security can you contractually demand for
when you outsource your application development? 

*          Who is legally responsible when you personal data is exposed
through hacking activity in Belgium? 

*	20h00 - 20h15: break
*	20h15 - 21h15: Lieven Desmet 

Lieven Desmet was born on January 16, 1979 in Roeselare. He received a
Bachelor of Applied Sciences and Engineering degree and graduated magna cum
laude in Master of Applied Sciences and Engineering: Computer Science from
the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in July 2002. 

He started working as a Ph.D. student at the DistriNet (Distributed systems
and computer Networks) research group of the Department of Computer Science
at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Within DistriNet, he was active in
both the networking and security task forces. Lieven received his PhD on
software security in January 2007 and is currently active as a post-doctoral
security researcher within DistriNet.

&quot;Formal absence of implementation bugs in web applications: a case study on
indirect data sharing&quot;: Presentation + Discussion

Several research tracks focus on tools and techniques to verify or guarantee
the absence of implementation bugs in web applications, either at
compile-time or at run-time. By guaranteeing the absence of certain
implementation bugs, the reliability and security of the application can be
improved. In this presentation, we will focus on the absence of
implementation bugs due to broken data dependencies.

Web applications typically share non-persistent session data between
different parts of the application, e.g. a shopping cart in a e-commerce
application. By doing so, implicit dependencies arise between the different
parts of the application, and breaking these dependencies in an application
may result in information leakage of erroneous behavior.

In our research, we explicitly model dependencies between components that
indirectly share data. Next, we verify that in a given composition these
dependencies are not broken by applying a combination of static verification
and dynamic checking (e.g. by using a Web Application Firewall).

We validated the presented approach in two existing applications: a
Struts-based, open-source webmail application (GatorMail) and an e-commerce
site (Duke's BookStore from the J2EE 1.4 tutorial).

*	21h15 - ??: Reception
