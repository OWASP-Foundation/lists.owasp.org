Dear ISSA-BE member,

Dear Security Professional,

 

Read further to learn more about the upcoming L-SEC seminar on Security Standards (free registration for ISSA-BE members) and about the SANS Secure Europe 2007 Conference in Brussels.

 

But first of all the ISSA Brussels-European Chapter is proud to announce its next IT Security Event:

&quot;Botnets and Botherders!&quot; 

 

Botnets are virtual networks comprised of PC's that have been hijacked by malware such as trojans / backdoors that got on that PC mostly through lack of operating system patches or outdated vulnerable software. As a result, you might be the rightful owner of the PC, but not the one in control : your PC is being controlled by some shady character on the other side of the globe and has been enlisted to his army of zombie PC's. Those zombie PC's, also called &quot;bots&quot;, are used for activities such as sending spam, performing (Distributed) Denial of Service attacks, scanning for other vulnerable computers, being a relay for hackers attacking other systems and so on. If you are looking for another good reason to keep your computer software up to date, you'll get plenty of them when attending this event!

 

This free evening event will be held on


Thursday May 24th, 2007 

 

Agenda :

1800h : Welcome with sandwiches and drinks

Abstract

The following topics will be covered:
- Botnet basics: Short introduction into botnets, what they are and how they
work.
- What is The Shadowserver Foundation and what are they doing?
- How can you capture malware on the network?
- How can you analyze the captured malware and what kind of tools can you use? A little demo will be given to illustrate this.
- What kind of activities (commands, etc..) can you see within a botnet?

The FAQ will include answers to questions such as :

- What is the estimate in numbers and sizes of botnets?
- How frequently are you being confronted with botnet cases?
- Have botnets already been used to attack Belgian companies / organisations, and to what degree?
- What can I do when someone is trying to extort me, threatening to launch a DDoS towards my infrastructure? And what can I do when effectively being confronted by a DDoS attack?
- What is my liability when it turns out that one of my PC's has been turned into a zombie / bot and has been used to hack another company's server? And how do I prove it wasn't me who hacked them?!?

On May 29th, L-SEC in collaboration with ISSA, ISACA and INFOPOLE Cluster TIC are organizing an evening seminar for their Members on International Standardization of IT Security.

The objective is to present the Information Security Management Systems, Governance  and Compliance and Implementation and Certification of IT security standards. This update is both a follow-up for the seminar organized early 2006, as well as an introduction for newly interested participants.

Who Should Attend : Members and their invites; CISO&#8217;s, IT Security Managers, Business Managers, Representatives from IT Security Services Providers, Business Owners, &#8230;

Background :

In the last 20 years security has evolved from an &#8220;exclusivity&#8221; within the IT department of a company or organization with limited resources to an inherent part of the corporate governance and strategy. IT security changed from a very fragmented &#8220;reactive&#8221; approach to an integrated &#8220;pro-active&#8221; strategy which is today more and more business driven from a risk management perspective. The aim of the seminar is to provide an update on recent international standardization developments in the area of Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) as follow-up on the seminar organized in January 2006.

It is obvious that for reasons such as interoperability and cost-effectiveness &#8220;standardization&#8221; plays a major role in IT Security. Standardization provides interoperability and cost-effectiveness in an area of in-depth complexity. The aim of the seminar is to bring an overview on the 2700x series of standards on Information Security Management (ISMS) which are specified by ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 27. Next an update will be given on some of the implementation and certification aspects based on these series. Also the relation between Corporate and IT-Governance and the implementation of an ISM system will be presented. Finally, the seminar aims to conclude with an open discussion on the potential creation of a Belgian ISMS user group, in analogy to other countries worldwide.

The Seminar will be hosted by Cisco Systems, at the Cisco offices in Diegem.

Program :

15.30 h : registration opening
16.00 h : introduction by L-SEC, Ulrich Seldeslachts
