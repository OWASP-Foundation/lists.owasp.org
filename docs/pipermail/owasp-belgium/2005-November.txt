Subject: [Owasp-belgium] [Owasp-world] Welcome to OWASP
Message-ID: <020f01c5df23$b7ea1d30$4301a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Hello everyone,

 

You're receiving this message because you are subscribed to one or more Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP) mailing lists (http://www.owasp.org
<http://www.owasp.org/> ). OWASP-WORLD is a low-volume mailing list reserved
for important events and announcements of interest to everyone in the OWASP
community.

  
1) Basic Philosophy: OWASP's mission is to find and fight the causes of
application vulnerabilities. These span organizational issues, people
issues, process issues, and technology issues. OWASP encourages the informed
use of application security technologies while being critical of excessive
vendor claims.  Note that OWASP does not focus on network or infrastructure
security issues, as the application layer has its own unique issues,
techniques, and technologies.



2) History: OWASP is an open source project started in 2000. The OWASP
Foundation was established as a 501c3 not-for-profit in 2003 and currently
we have thousands of participants around the world.  Our website receives
millions of hits every month and our work (tools and documentation) is used
by many corporations and agencies around the world.  We also have over 50
local chapters working to spread knowledge of application security.  Please
take a minute to explore the website to see the projects and chapters there.
 
3) Organization: OWASP does all of its work in the open, and everything is
available under one of the open source licenses. We operate on a shoestring
budget and rely on dedicated individuals for just about everything. We've
recently started a membership program so that organizations that benefit
from the work done by the OWASP community can support our mission.



You may be interested in the presentations from the most recent OWASP
conference at NIST.  They are available on the OWASP website at
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc/schedule.html.  All of the
presentations were videotaped and will be made available for viewing online
soon.

 

Thank you all for your support of OWASP.

 

--Jeff

Dear chapter members,
 
Up until now I have not received any suggestions and or proposals to do
something on the next chapter meeting, 
except one proposal for a more general non-OWASP related presentation
(appreciated).
 
I want to make clear that the chapter meetings are organized for you to
exchange experience and knowledge on OWASP related subjects.
It benefits us all, when you provide input and feedback on the OWASP
discussions and projects.
This chapter will only become succesful if you participate. 
 
I am personally not looking for "ready-made" presentations, although
they can be helpful.
I am asking you: 
1) your opinion on what should be done during the next chapter
meeting(s)?
Should we elaborate in more detail on current OWASP projects?
Do we create local sub-groups that take on specific topics such as e.g.
Belgian awareness sessions, Legal projects for Belgian Law?
Do we organize a Q&A session on novice topics, or on expert topics?
How do we liaison with Belgian universities or high-schools to put
application security on the curriculum?
etc...
2) to take one of these or your own topic and do something with it
during the next meeting: presentation, Q&A, workshop, sub-group, ...
3) Testimonials on how OWASP material (could have) helped you with your
particular job or project are also highly welcome
 
I am extending the period for proposals/ideas/remarks to Sunday Dec 4th.
If I have not received enough feedback to set up the next OWASP meeting
on Dec 12th we will have to postpone the chapter meeting to next year.
 
Only together can we do this.
 
Thank you
 
With kind regards,
 
Seba

Hi list,
 
A suggestion for the next meeting:
 
 -Is someone interested in giving a presentation on the different tools he
uses while testing/auditing web apps?
or
 - Can someone explain how they have applied a secure development lifecycle
in their organisation?
or
 - A discussion about the difficulties we have to convince people of web
application security + define actionplan
 
Hope to see some responses :)
 
Erwin
