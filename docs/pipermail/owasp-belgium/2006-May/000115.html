<PRE>Dear  List Member ,

 

First I would like to remind you of the 2nd European OWASP Conference on
30-31 of May.

Do not miss this unique opportunity. Not only is it hosted in Belgium by
KULeuven, but it

provides an agenda loaded with very interesting web application security
topics!

For details and registration, visit
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html">http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html</A>

 

Second, I invite you to the next OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting!

 

WHAT
The Open Web Application Security Project (www.owasp.org
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/">http://www.owasp.org/</A>&gt; ) Belgian Chapter organizes their next Chapter
meeting.

OWASP's all-volunteer participants produce free, professional quality,
open-source documentation, tools, and standards on application security.


An example of this is the famous OWASP top ten of most critical web
application security flaws. 

The OWASP community facilitates conferences, local chapters, articles,
and message forums.

Participation in OWASP is free and open to all, as are all the materials
we produce.

 

WHEN
Monday 8th of May 2006, 18h30 - 20h30.

 

Already mark your agenda's for the next chapter meetings this year:

*          Thursday Sep 14th 2006 - Antwerp

*          Tuesday Nov 21 2006 - Brussels

Timing 18h-21h, updates on <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html">http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html</A>

 

WHERE

Deloitte &lt;<A HREF="http://www.deloitte.be/">http://www.deloitte.be/</A>&gt;  sponsors the venue, drinks and
snacks:

Location: Deloite Diegem, route can be found online
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/cda/doc/content/RouteDescriptionDiegem.pdf">http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/cda/doc/content/RouteDescriptionDiegem.pdf</A>&gt;
. 

 

 

PROGRAM

*	18h00 - 18h30: Welcome, get drink &amp; snack 
*	18h30 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, Ascure 
	    OWASP Update 
*	18h45 - 19h15: Hillar Leoste, Zone-H
	   2005 Internet Attack Statistics for Belgium 

Presentation + Discussion

Zone-h maintains the largest archive of information about attacks
against 

Internet web servers. Every day the Zone-H volunteers receive an average


of 2,500 notifications related to web server intrusions.

Hillar will filter out the 2005 statistics for Belgium.

I am sure this will provide an interesting topic to discuss about!

*	19h15 - 20h30: Johan Peeters, Program Director secappdev.org 

   Can &quot;Agile&quot; Development Produce Secure Applications?

Presentation + Discussion

Received wisdom has it that secure development and agile processes do 

not mix. Is that really so? Agile practices have proven in many 

projects to yield applications with fewer functional defects. Can they 

also be put to work to reduce the number of security vulnerabilities?

 

WHO should attend

Anyone interested in Web Application Security (management, security
professionals, developers, students, etc).

OWASP Belgium chapter membership is free. All meetings are free. 

There are never vendor pitches or sales presentations at OWASP meetings.

Check our chapter page <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html">http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html">http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html</A>&gt;  on meeting details, sign up
to the chapter mailing list and introduce yourself.

 

Please drop a mail to <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-belgium">sdl at ascure.com</A> if you plan to attend, 

so we can size the venue appropriately and keep you updated on
last-minute changes.

 

Please forward to anyone you feel would have an interest in these
events.

 

Thank you,
