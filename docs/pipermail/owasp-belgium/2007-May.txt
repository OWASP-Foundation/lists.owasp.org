The Open Web Application Security Project ( <http://www.owasp.org/>
www.owasp.org) Belgium/Luxemburg Chapter organizes their next Chapter
meeting.

OWASP's all-volunteer participants produce free, professional quality,
open-source documentation, tools, and standards on application security. 

An example of this is the famous OWASP top ten of most critical web
application security flaws. 

The OWASP community facilitates conferences, local chapters, articles, and
message forums.

Participation in OWASP is free and open to all, as are all the materials we
produce.

 

WHEN
Thursday 10th of May 2007, 18h00 - 21h15

He is also Professor of Law at the Faculty of Law (K.U.Leuven) and Director
of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Law and Information Technology
(http://www.icri.be <http://www.icri.be/> ).

"Legal Aspects of (Web) Application Security": Presentation + Discussion

Jos Dumortier will discuss important questions such as:

*          How far can you go if you want to 'test' the security of a web
site? 

*          How much application security can you contractually demand for
when you outsource your application development? 

*          Who is legally responsible when you personal data is exposed
through hacking activity in Belgium? 

*	20h00 - 20h15: break

Lieven Desmet was born on January 16, 1979 in Roeselare. He received a
Bachelor of Applied Sciences and Engineering degree and graduated magna cum
laude in Master of Applied Sciences and Engineering: Computer Science from
the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in July 2002. 

He started working as a Ph.D. student at the DistriNet (Distributed systems
and computer Networks) research group of the Department of Computer Science
at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Within DistriNet, he was active in
both the networking and security task forces. Lieven received his PhD on
software security in January 2007 and is currently active as a post-doctoral
security researcher within DistriNet.

"Formal absence of implementation bugs in web applications: a case study on
indirect data sharing": Presentation + Discussion

Several research tracks focus on tools and techniques to verify or guarantee
the absence of implementation bugs in web applications, either at
compile-time or at run-time. By guaranteeing the absence of certain
implementation bugs, the reliability and security of the application can be
improved. In this presentation, we will focus on the absence of
implementation bugs due to broken data dependencies.

Web applications typically share non-persistent session data between
different parts of the application, e.g. a shopping cart in a e-commerce
application. By doing so, implicit dependencies arise between the different
parts of the application, and breaking these dependencies in an application
may result in information leakage of erroneous behavior.

In our research, we explicitly model dependencies between components that
indirectly share data. Next, we verify that in a given composition these
dependencies are not broken by applying a combination of static verification
and dynamic checking (e.g. by using a Web Application Firewall).

We validated the presented approach in two existing applications: a
Struts-based, open-source webmail application (GatorMail) and an e-commerce
site (Duke's BookStore from the J2EE 1.4 tutorial).

*	21h15 - ??: Reception

 

WHO should attend?

Anyone interested in Web Application Security (management, security
professionals, developers, students, etc).

OWASP Belgium/Luxemburg chapter membership is free. All meetings are free. 

There are never vendor pitches or sales presentations at OWASP meetings.

Check our chapter page http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Belgium on meeting
details, sign up to the chapter mailing list and introduce yourself.

 

Please send a mail to seba at deleersnyder.eu to register by Monday evening, 

so we can size the venue appropriately and keep you updated on last-minute
changes.

 

Please forward to anyone you feel would have an interest in these events.

 

Thank you,

Subject: [SC-L] WASC Announcement: Distributed Open Proxy Honeypot

ProjectData Released

The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) is pleased to announce
the

inital release of data collected by the Distributed Open Proxy

Honeypot Project. This first release of information is for data gathered

from January - April, 2007. During this timeframe, we had 7
internationally

placed honeypot sensors deployed and sending their data back to our
central

logging host.

What did we see? Here are some brief highlights -

- SQL Injection Attacks

- Brute Force Attacks

- OS Command Injection

- Web Defacement Attempts

- Google-Abuses (Google-Hacking and Proxying for BannerAd/Click Fraud)

- Information Leakage

We have created a PDF document here -

http://www.webappsec.org/projects/honeypots/Threat_Report_05072007.pdf
<http://www.webappsec.org/projects/honeypots/Threat_Report_05072007.pdf>


. The attacks are mapped to the WASC Threat Classification categories.

There are some high-level statistics shown, however they are very crude
as

this was not the focus of this phase of the project. We understand that
the

data presented is a bit raw, however we wanted to release this
information

so that the public may have a chance to review it and provide feedback.
Our

initial goal was to identify the types of current attacks that are using

open proxy servers. In our future deployments, we will attempt to refine

the data analysis processes to extract out trend data and high level

concepts. In the near future, we will be updating both the VMware
honeypot

sensors themselves and will also use a newer version of the centralize

logging host (ModSecurity Console).

We are also planning to release more frequent information in the form of

diary entries on the project webpage as new attacks/trends are
identified.

While the initial deployment was a success, we still need participants
who

are willing to participate by deploying our VMware honeypot sensor on
their

network. If you are interested in participating, please send an email to

Ryan Barnett at - RCBarnett_ at _gmail.com.

     <http://www.issa-be.org/mambo/templates/box_business_blue/images/banner.jpg> 

 <http://www.owasp.org/> 

Dear ISSA-BE member,

Dear Security Professional,

 

Read further to learn more about the upcoming L-SEC seminar on Security Standards (free registration for ISSA-BE members) and about the SANS Secure Europe 2007 Conference in Brussels.

 

But first of all the ISSA Brussels-European Chapter is proud to announce its next IT Security Event:

"Botnets and Botherders!" 

 

Botnets are virtual networks comprised of PC's that have been hijacked by malware such as trojans / backdoors that got on that PC mostly through lack of operating system patches or outdated vulnerable software. As a result, you might be the rightful owner of the PC, but not the one in control : your PC is being controlled by some shady character on the other side of the globe and has been enlisted to his army of zombie PC's. Those zombie PC's, also called "bots", are used for activities such as sending spam, performing (Distributed) Denial of Service attacks, scanning for other vulnerable computers, being a relay for hackers attacking other systems and so on. If you are looking for another good reason to keep your computer software up to date, you'll get plenty of them when attending this event!

 

This free evening event will be held on


Thursday May 24th, 2007 

 

Agenda :

1800h : Welcome with sandwiches and drinks
1830h : part 1

   1. Botnet basics (Hillar)

   2. Shadowserver (Hillar)

   3. Capturing malware (Christophe)
? 1915h : short break 
? 1930h : part 2

   4. Analyzing malware - theory + demo (Migu?l + Christophe)

   5. Botnet activity (Hillar)

   6. FAQ + Questions (Hillar + Christophe + Migu?l)

2045h : closing drink 

This event will be held in the Club Prince Albert, Karmelietenstraat / rue des Petits Carmes 20, 1000 Brussels (access plan at http://www.mil.be/CPA/subject/index.asp?LAN=en <http://www.mil.be/CPA/subject/index.asp?LAN=en&ID=817> &ID=817). Please bear in mind that the dress code at the Club is "business casual".

Registration for the event is free but mandatory. In case there would be more registrations than available seats, ISSA members in good standing and trial members will be favoured over other people in a ratio of 70% (trial-)members to 30% non-members. Early registrants will have precedence over late registrants. Registration starts as of May 15th. Non-members as well as ISSA Members have to register by e-mailing their contact details to  <http://uk.f250.mail.yahoo.com/ym/Compose?To=Tomas.Vanhoof at issa-be.org> register at issa-be.org mentioning "registration for the ISSA Botnets event" in the subject line. 

Free trial memberships can be set up through  <http://www.issa.org/join.html> http://www.issa.org/join.html - don't forget to choose "Brussels European" as Chapter Affiliation! 

Abstract

The following topics will be covered:
- Botnet basics: Short introduction into botnets, what they are and how they
work.
- What is The Shadowserver Foundation and what are they doing?
- How can you capture malware on the network?
- How can you analyze the captured malware and what kind of tools can you use? A little demo will be given to illustrate this.
- What kind of activities (commands, etc..) can you see within a botnet?

The FAQ will include answers to questions such as :

- What is the estimate in numbers and sizes of botnets?
- How frequently are you being confronted with botnet cases?
- Have botnets already been used to attack Belgian companies / organisations, and to what degree?
- What can I do when someone is trying to extort me, threatening to launch a DDoS towards my infrastructure? And what can I do when effectively being confronted by a DDoS attack?
- What is my liability when it turns out that one of my PC's has been turned into a zombie / bot and has been used to hack another company's server? And how do I prove it wasn't me who hacked them?!?

Speakers Bio

***

On May 29th, L-SEC in collaboration with ISSA, ISACA and INFOPOLE Cluster TIC are organizing an evening seminar for their Members on International Standardization of IT Security.

The objective is to present the Information Security Management Systems, Governance  and Compliance and Implementation and Certification of IT security standards. This update is both a follow-up for the seminar organized early 2006, as well as an introduction for newly interested participants.

Who Should Attend : Members and their invites; CISO?s, IT Security Managers, Business Managers, Representatives from IT Security Services Providers, Business Owners, ?

Background :

In the last 20 years security has evolved from an ?exclusivity? within the IT department of a company or organization with limited resources to an inherent part of the corporate governance and strategy. IT security changed from a very fragmented ?reactive? approach to an integrated ?pro-active? strategy which is today more and more business driven from a risk management perspective. The aim of the seminar is to provide an update on recent international standardization developments in the area of Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) as follow-up on the seminar organized in January 2006.

It is obvious that for reasons such as interoperability and cost-effectiveness ?standardization? plays a major role in IT Security. Standardization provides interoperability and cost-effectiveness in an area of in-depth complexity. The aim of the seminar is to bring an overview on the 2700x series of standards on Information Security Management (ISMS) which are specified by ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 27. Next an update will be given on some of the implementation and certification aspects based on these series. Also the relation between Corporate and IT-Governance and the implementation of an ISM system will be presented. Finally, the seminar aims to conclude with an open discussion on the potential creation of a Belgian ISMS user group, in analogy to other countries worldwide.

The Seminar will be hosted by Cisco Systems, at the Cisco offices in Diegem.
