Hi,

For people who want more of Mario Heiderich (previous chapter meeting), he
will be back in Belgium for the BruCON Spring Trainings:
http://blog.brucon.org/2013/11/extra-brucon-spring-trainings-2014.html

=> "Offensive HTML, SVG, CSS and other Browser-Evil by Mario Heiderich
(Cure53)"

highly recommended!

regards,

Seba
