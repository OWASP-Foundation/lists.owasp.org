We are pleased to release another free tool for your pleasure....

For the Less Impatient

CookieDigger, designed by Foundstone, is a free tool to help identify
weak cookie generation and usage by web applications. The tool works by
collecting and analyzing cookies issued by a web application for
multiple users.  

The tools functionality can be divided into 3 broad categories. 
1.	Cookie Collection
2.	Cookie Analyses
3.	Results

Average Length of the Cookie: If the average cookie length of the cookie
that is used as an authenticator is small then it would take fewer brute
force attempts to hijack another users session.  On a popular site we
can assume many users to be logged in at the same time, therefore the
chances of a successful brute force attempt is high. 

Character Set of the Cookie: The character set employed in the
generation of cookie value plays an important role in the determining
the strength of the authenticator. For any given cookie length, a large
character set increases the strength of the authenticator exponentially.
If the attacker can determine the character set employed by the
application, the brute force attempts can be crafted more efficiently.
The combination of the length of the cookie and the character set used
determines the strength of the authenticator.  
 
Critical Information: The tool checks the cookie values set by the
application to see if any of the cookies contains the usernames or
password values in it. The check is performed on both the plain text
value of the cookie and on the base64 decoded value of the cookie. Other
common useful information passed in the cookie values are account
numbers, names, privilege levels, etc. 

Entropy of the Cookies: The tool compares the different values of the
cookie values to check how many characters are changing for every
subsequent login. If the cookie value remains the same on subsequent
logins, it shows that the algorithm used for generating the cookies is
vulnerable to chosen plain text attacks. Furthermore, if the cookie
values remain the same on subsequent logins it gives the attacker longer
periods of time to perform the brute forces attempts.

Anyhow, I enjoyed this chapter meeting.

Dear list,

 

On 26th of May 2005 we held the first OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting!

It was a big success: we had nearly 40 people attending, despite the
Belgium-unlike hot weather.

PROGRAM

*	17h30 - 18h00: Welcome & get a drink 
*	18h00 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, Ascure 
	    OWASP Introduction 
*	19h00 - 19h45: Erwin Geirnaert, Security Innovation
	    How to Break Web Application Security 
*	20h00 - 20h45: professor Frank Piessens, KU Leuven
	    How to Build Secure Web Applications

We had some interesting discussions with Frank on the position of
security controls: within the code or within the supporting
infrastructure?
Another idea is also to look for a top 10 solutions for Web Applications
and have some guidance system when selecting countermeasures.

 

Check our chapter page http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html
<http://www.owasp.org/local/belgium.html>  on meeting notes.

The presentations will also be posted to the chapter mailing list.

 

NEXT MEETING

We'll organize the next chapter meeting in September and look for an
air-conditioned venue (possibly coordinated with ISSA Belgium).

Sign up to the chapter mailing list
<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-belgium/> , introduce
yourself and post topic suggestions for the next chapter meeting.

 

Please forward this mail to anyone you feel would have an interest in
future Chapter meetings.

 

Thank you,

Dear list,
 
Good news for the CISSPs among us: the OWASP chapter meetings do count
for CPE credits.
I am not sure about the amount though: I've received a mail stating that
it would count for 2 points.
 
Now there's no reason not to come ;-)
 
Still waiting for topic suggestions ?

I think that the authentication part is certainly a great idea!
I'm certainly interested in the stuff related to cookies and authentication,
session tracking ...

Many thanks for your answers.
What do you mean when you say:"They will keep some form of proof that they were there"? Is it right for you a document in which I write and sign that Mr. White was at the meeting ?

Dear list,
 
For you who did not subscribe in time to get the presentations:
It will take some time to post the presentations on the OWASP web site
due to a-not-so-easy editor interface, resulting in me having to ask the
owasp admin to put them online.
 
I'll send a notice to the list when the presentations are available
online.
 
regards,
 
Seba

Subject: [Owasp-belgium] Possible Topics next chapter meeting
Message-ID: <6A4CBD7546EAA346B305F94CE36480290DFA33@mwa.uniskill.com>

Hello

Are there any plans for topics of a more broader approach than the ones
mentioned on this list?  I'm sure that if you look hard enough on the
web or buy the right books you'll find out how to secure an apache
server with PHP.  I think everyone that visits the OWASP meetings knows
a thing or two about websecurity and topics like that aren't going to
attract a lot of people with a large bookcase.  Unless these meetings
are social networking only which isn't really the idea.

Any talks about the future of websecurity?  The tendencies of the
current products on the market and their roadmaps?  The influence of
Single-Sign-On?  The implications and technology behind digital
passports such as the attempt made by Microsoft and Hotmail?  Future
expected attacks and the protection thereof?  SSL VPN strengths,
weaknesses and how to assess?  Testimonies of people responsible for the
security of webfarms of 50-100+ servers and their approach and views on
the matter?

I see a lot of ideas but nothing really new that hasn't been discussed
in an O'Reilly book. 

Kind regards

Hi,
I think that the authentication part is certainly a great idea!
I'm certainly interested in the stuff related to cookies and
authentication,
session tracking ...


Gr,
Philippe Bogaerts

Hi,

I have some suggestions for possible topics for one of the following
chapter meetings:
* Authentication for web applications (first a general overview, second
more detailed)
* Apache + PHP for web apps secure setup
