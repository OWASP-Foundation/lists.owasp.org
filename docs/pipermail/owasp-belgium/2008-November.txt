December 11th 2008: OWASP Netherlands chapter meeting

The next OWASP Netherlands meeting is a FREE workshop on architectural and
design risk analysis, given by Lars-Helge Netland and Andr? N. Klingsheim.
They are software security analysts at, and co-owners of, NoWires Group AS.
They both hold PhD degrees in applied software security, focused on risk
analysis of software architecture and design.

This workshop will explore how businesses can use risk analysis in the
architecture/design phase of software development to produce more secure
software. Participants will get an introduction to risk analysis, which will
cover both definitions and how to apply the concepts in practice. The
workshop consists of four parts: a short overview of current security
threats; an introduction to risk management; an exploration of the
limitations of risk management; and some real world applications of the
presented techniques.

For more details, see the attached announcement.

Best Regards,

Bert Koelewijn
OWASP Netherlands chapter team
