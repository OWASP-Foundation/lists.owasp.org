Hi Austin,

We did not have a lot of people attending the Web Application Security
Vendor Session.
I think this is because of:
- bad schedule: 12h30-13h00
- Infosecurity target audience is IT security, more product focused
But the feedback was positive!
If we want to reach a broader audience developer forums have to be
targeted.
I think e.g. about JavaPolis.
Anybody knows about a Microsoft-focused developer event where OWASP
could be promoted?

You mean that we organize some informal pre kick-off meeting?

I myself am also CISSP, it is an ideal opportunity to get acquainted
with the 10 knowledge domains. Normally one has experience with a subset
of them. I used the book of Shon Harris to prepare myself.

Regards,

Seba

Hi Sebastien,

I didn't have a chance to attend Inforsecurity.BE. 

You wrote previously:
> I'll anounce the OWASP BE Chapter kick-off on Infosecurity during a 
> Vendor Speech related to Web App Security.

Did you get any responses/feedback?  I think it would be interesting to
try an initial meeting.  

Right now I'm studying for the CISSP certification
(http://www.cissps.com).  Any other like minded individuals here in
Brussels/Belgium?

--Austin

Howdy Sebastien,

Here's a little input about myself.  I'm an American
living in Europe for four years now.  Most recently
I've been working as a consultant at Agfa (near
Antwerp).  I've just recently married and will now be
making a permanent move to Brussels.  I started out
doing unix/windows admin work (in 1996), transitioned
to java programming and now split my time between the
two, depending on the work.  I've been focused on
security for sometime but have only recently decided
to pursue certification (CISSP). 

As for meetings I'm very interesting in:
 -- IDS and penetration tools
 -- security experts discussing their profession
 -- demos of security products
 -- recommended books and magazines
 -- meeting other like minded folks

Looking forward to the meetings!  --Austin
