Hi Fellow Chapter members,

Next month 8th of May is the next chapter meeting in Brussels (at
Deloitte).
Any suggestions and/or candidates on:
1) Novice / introduction topics 
2) Expert topics to perform:
  a. Setting the scene
  b. Q&A session / round table
3) Are there items we can split up into focus groups /
Birds-Of-a-Feather (BOF) sessions?

Do not hesitate to contact me or throw it in the group for discussion.

If you have a Web Application Security related question: can also be
considered, you do not have to do a presentation!

Remember: only by your participation will we make the chapter meetings a
success for all of us!

Thank you!

Kind regards,

PS: don't forget we have the OWASP European conference end of May in
Belgium:

Dear List Members,

With permission I forward the proposal of Bavo below. Your opinion?

What about something on Web Services Security ?

Kind regards,

Hi,

Maybe I missed this topic by not attending a previous chapter meeting
(sorry for that).

What about a general introduction to "Web Application Security": some
history, definition of the problem space, solutions today (ranging from
programming practices to WAF and beyond) and future trends. I myself
have a solid background and experience in Identity & Access Management
and I have written my share of web applications in the past. However, my
understanding and knowledge about web application security is currently
limited.

I am also convinced that by presenting a broader introduction to the
topic, discussions will spawn that will identify future (expert) topics
for OWASP chapter meetings.

Any followers?
