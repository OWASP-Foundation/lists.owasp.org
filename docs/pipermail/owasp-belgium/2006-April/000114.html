<PRE>Dear List Members,

With permission I forward the proposal of Bavo below. Your opinion?

What about something on Web Services Security ?

Kind regards,

Hi,

Maybe I missed this topic by not attending a previous chapter meeting
(sorry for that).

What about a general introduction to &quot;Web Application Security&quot;: some
history, definition of the problem space, solutions today (ranging from
programming practices to WAF and beyond) and future trends. I myself
have a solid background and experience in Identity &amp; Access Management
and I have written my share of web applications in the past. However, my
understanding and knowledge about web application security is currently
limited.

I am also convinced that by presenting a broader introduction to the
topic, discussions will spawn that will identify future (expert) topics
for OWASP chapter meetings.

Any followers?

Hi Fellow Chapter members,

Next month 8th of May is the next chapter meeting in Brussels (at
Deloitte).
Any suggestions and/or candidates on:
1) Novice / introduction topics
2) Expert topics to perform:
  a. Setting the scene
  b. Q&amp;A session / round table
3) Are there items we can split up into focus groups /
Birds-Of-a-Feather (BOF) sessions?

Do not hesitate to contact me or throw it in the group for discussion.

If you have a Web Application Security related question: can also be
considered, you do not have to do a presentation!

Remember: only by your participation will we make the chapter meetings a
success for all of us!

Thank you!

Kind regards,

PS: don't forget we have the OWASP European conference end of May in
Belgium:
