Another security luminary who will be shining his light at SecAppDev
is prof. Dan Wallach of Rice University. He has been invited by the
Leuven Center on Information and Communication Technology (LICT -
http://www.kuleuven.be/LICT/) to deliver a distinguished lecture while
he is here. Dan will be speaking about the cryptography for e-voting.
The lecture takes place on Wednesday March 2nd in ESAT's Auditorium,
Kasteelpark Arenberg 10, 3001 Leuven and is starting at 18:30h.
Sandwiches courtesy of SecAppDev will be available from 18:00h. The
lecture is free of charge, but requires registration at
http://www.kuleuven.be/LICT/index.php?option=com_mad4joomla&jid=2&Itemid=63
by February 27th.

Dan Wallach is widely credited for the invention of the stack
inspection technique, now at the heart of the JVM's and CLR's security
model. As the associate director of ACCURATE (A Center for Correct,
Usable, Reliable, Auditable and Transparent Elections), he has been
regularly in the news during the spate of discoveries of e-voting
system vulnerabilities in recent years. He has testified about voting
security issues before government bodies in the U.S., Mexico, and the
European Union, and has served as an expert witness in a number of
voting technology lawsuits.

At SecAppDev, Dan will also be talking about the engineering of
reliable e-voting systems, secure logging and the mobile application
security - see the program at http://secappdev.flotilla/pages/8.

I hope to see you at either of these events,

Yo
