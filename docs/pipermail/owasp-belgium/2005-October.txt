Subject: [Owasp-belgium] September 28 2005 meeting minutes of second OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting
Message-ID: <C840A806BF100245B61F70F24C28C233309448@CASTOR.office.ascure.com>

Dear List,

 

On 28th of September 2005 we had our second OWASP Belgium Chapter
meeting!

Here are the meeting minutes.

 

WHEN
Wednesday 28th of September 2005, 18h00 - 21h00.
 

PROGRAM

*	18h00 - 18h15: Welcome & get a drink 
*	18h15 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, Ascure 
	    OWASP & OWASP Membership 
	    The presentation is included as attachment 
*	18h45 - 19h30: Emmanuel Bergmans, I-logs
	    Securing Web Applications with ModSecurity
	    Emmanuel gave an interesting introduction on ModSecurity.
	    The presentation is included as attachment and contains a
lot of great pointers and SWOT analysis.
	    Conclusions were:
	        ModSecurity can be particularly useful in an ISP
environment
	        Increased effort is necessary to synchronize multiple
ModSecurity configurations in a Webfarm 
*	19h30 - 20h45: 
	    OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities: Panel Discussion
	        OWASP Top 10
<http://www.owasp.org/documentation/topten.html> : 
	        The presentation is included with an introduction of the
TOP 10.
	        Then we had a lively panel Discussion with: 

		*	Erwin Geirnaert, Security Innovation 
		*	Dirk Dussart, Belgian Post 
		*	Eric Devolder, Mastercard 
		*	Herman Stevens, Ubizen 
		*	Frank Piessens, KU Leuven

We handled questions about the Top 10:
Is the OWASP Top 10 still necessary?
Are we talking vulnerabilities, solutions or threats?
Can we base our best practices / standards on the Top 10?
How to test your web site security on the Top 10?
...

The overall discussion was interesting, and at times diverted to an
overall application security discussion. 
Some of the remarkable opinions covered:
Can / or should the OWASP Top 10 form the basis for a certification
scheme
If it is used as an awareness tool, can we promote it with an OWASP
magazine?
The OWASP Top 10 is too vague
A bigger exhaustive list is needed with a clear classification and
taxonomy
It should be based on threat modelling.
One of the more pertinent questions: how did the original authors come
to the Top 10?
etc..
 
If you have any other remarks or questions to add please let me know.
 
Thank you,
 
With kind regards,

Sebastien Deleersnyder
