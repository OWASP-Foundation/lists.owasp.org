Hi,
 
Who wants to demonstrate WebScarab and provide some basic quick start
tips?
A comparison with other similar tools (open source or commercial) like
paros, Firefox plugins, vForce, ... would be nice.
 
Are there people on the list that can program Java and like WebScarab? I
am sure improvements can be suggested as well?
 
Thx,
 
Mvg,
 
Seba

I think we all know how Webscarab works...  Pentest proxies like webscarab, achilles etc more or less all work in the same way.  How about a Webscarab demonstration on how to avoid Layer 7 firewalls and/or application proxies/firewalls?  IDS/IPS evasion?  How to exploit/assess/audit a certain webtechnology (jsp, php, perl, asp, ...) ?

Tom,

most of those proxy tools use the same techniques more or less like you
note. I would however would like to have an overview of any special
features of those tools. I work with the BURP suite for example which has
the nice feature of doing automated and customizable attacks on parameters.
I don't think Paros and others feature this kind of option, but they will
probably have other nice features. It would be interesting to get an
overview of the tools and any special functions.

I also agree that layer 7 firewall evasion techniques would be a nice
topic. Everyone how to find bad input filtering techniques in websites, but
is it possible to circumvent certain filters? 

cheers

Dear Chapter members,
 
I appreciate the input you all send me, but I think it is better to
postpone the chapter meeting to next year.
 
Probably we can set up a New-Year's drink in January to talk about how
to fill in the Chapter objectives for 2006 ?
 
My proposal is to split up the chapter meetings in 2 parts:
e.g. 18h-19h - introduction and session for people who are new on the
(We)AppSec matter
19h-20h - an advanced topic (like suggested by Tom on e.g. evasion
techniques).
 
I would like to hold a quick poll (answer to me, I'll post back the
compiled answers by the end of the week):
Q1: Do you consider yourself:
a) "new to beginner" on (Web)AppSec topics
b) "advaced to expert" on (Web)AppSec topics
 
Q2: How many chapter meetings would you like to attend in 2006:
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
 
Q3: If given some time to prepare a topic, would you consider preparing
a session for a chapter meeting:
a) yes
b) no
 
Thanks for your responses!
 
Kind regards,
 
Seba

Q1: I consider myself an experienced risk manager in the domain of
application security. In other words, no knowledge on teechnical points
or specific points within a development environment.
Talking technics - I'm novice, but worse I'm not really interested. I'm
probably not the target audience for a normal OWASP meeting.
 
Q2: As my office is mainly in Amsterdam, I have difficulties to attend
session during the week in Brussels, unless announced long before date
and the topics interests me. With the previous conditions in mind, I
have no problem in attending 3 to 4 meetings, but due to my lack of
technological knowledge, I will even if planning the meeting well in
advance, I will probably limit my presence to 2 times. (hope I'm cclear)
 
Q3: I'm willing to prepare a subject, as long as it is NOT technical,
but managerial. E.g. explain how ING incorporated the Information risk
requirements (and thus security requirements) in the Project lifecycle.

Q0: I was looking forward for the meeting with agfa. We should
nevertheless try to avoid presenting generalities where no one has
learned something on the subject. An in depth evaluation and (experience
of) usage of a tool would be worth a session.
Q1:  I am an experienced OS security officer and auditor, I passed the
beginners state and am more or less advanced in the field of Web appsec.
Q2: four of them
Q3: I 'd like to wait some time to become expert before being exposed to
a group of experts.

Dear Chapter members,
=20
I appreciate the input you all send me, but I think it is better to
postpone the chapter meeting to next year.
=20
Probably we can set up a New-Year's drink in January to talk about how
to fill in the Chapter objectives for 2006 ?
=20
My proposal is to split up the chapter meetings in 2 parts:
e.g. 18h-19h - introduction and session for people who are new on the
(We)AppSec matter
19h-20h - an advanced topic (like suggested by Tom on e.g. evasion
techniques).
=20
I would like to hold a quick poll (answer to me, I'll post back the
compiled answers by the end of the week):
Q1: Do you consider yourself:
a) "new to beginner" on (Web)AppSec topics
b) "advaced to expert" on (Web)AppSec topics
=20
Q2: How many chapter meetings would you like to attend in 2006:
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
=20
Q3: If given some time to prepare a topic, would you consider preparing
a session for a chapter meeting:
a) yes
b) no
=20
Thanks for your responses!
=20
Kind regards,
=20
Seba

	Dear chapter members,
	=20
	Up until now I have not received any suggestions and or
proposals to do something on the next chapter meeting,=20
	except one proposal for a more general non-OWASP related
presentation (appreciated).
	=20
	I want to make clear that the chapter meetings are organized for
you to exchange experience and knowledge on OWASP related subjects.
=09
	It benefits us all, when you provide input and feedback on the
OWASP discussions and projects.
	This chapter will only become succesful if you participate.=20
	=20
	I am personally not looking for "ready-made" presentations,
although they can be helpful.
	I am asking you:=20
	1) your opinion on what should be done during the next chapter
meeting(s)?
	Should we elaborate in more detail on current OWASP projects?
	Do we create local sub-groups that take on specific topics such
as e.g. Belgian awareness sessions, Legal projects for Belgian Law?
	Do we organize a Q&A session on novice topics, or on expert
topics?
	How do we liaison with Belgian universities or high-schools to
put application security on the curriculum?
	etc...
	2) to take one of these or your own topic and do something with
it during the next meeting: presentation, Q&A, workshop, sub-group, ...
	3) Testimonials on how OWASP material (could have) helped you
with your particular job or project are also highly welcome
	=20
	I am extending the period for proposals/ideas/remarks to Sunday
Dec 4th.
	If I have not received enough feedback to set up the next OWASP
meeting on Dec 12th we will have to postpone the chapter meeting to next
year.
	=20
	Only together can we do this.
	=20
	Thank you
	=20
	With kind regards,
	=20
	Seba

Q1: I consider myself an experienced risk manager in the domain of
application security. In other words, no knowledge on teechnical points
or specific points within a development environment.
Talking technics - I'm novice, but worse I'm not really interested. I'm
probably not the target audience for a normal OWASP meeting.
=20
Q2: As my office is mainly in Amsterdam, I have difficulties to attend
session during the week in Brussels, unless announced long before date
and the topics interests me. With the previous conditions in mind, I
have no problem in attending 3 to 4 meetings, but due to my lack of
technological knowledge, I will even if planning the meeting well in
advance, I will probably limit my presence to 2 times. (hope I'm cclear)
=20
Q3: I'm willing to prepare a subject, as long as it is NOT technical,
but managerial. E.g. explain how ING incorporated the Information risk
requirements (and thus security requirements) in the Project lifecycle.

Subject: [Owasp-belgium] Cancelled + Quick poll - next owasp chapter
meeting


Dear Chapter members,
=20
I appreciate the input you all send me, but I think it is better to
postpone the chapter meeting to next year.
=20
Probably we can set up a New-Year's drink in January to talk about how
to fill in the Chapter objectives for 2006 ?
=20
My proposal is to split up the chapter meetings in 2 parts:
e=2Eg. 18h-19h - introduction and session for people who are new on the
(We)AppSec matter
19h-20h - an advanced topic (like suggested by Tom on e.g. evasion
techniques).
=20
I would like to hold a quick poll (answer to me, I'll post back the
compiled answers by the end of the week):
Q1: Do you consider yourself:
a) "new to beginner" on (Web)AppSec topics
b) "advaced to expert" on (Web)AppSec topics
=20
Q2: How many chapter meetings would you like to attend in 2006:
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
=20
Q3: If given some time to prepare a topic, would you consider preparing
a session for a chapter meeting:
a) yes
b) no
=20
Thanks for your responses!
=20
Kind regards,
=20

Quickie
Importance: High


Dear chapter members,
=20
Up until now I have not received any suggestions and or proposals to do
something on the next chapter meeting,=20
except one proposal for a more general non-OWASP related presentation
(appreciated).
=20
I want to make clear that the chapter meetings are organized for you to
exchange experience and knowledge on OWASP related subjects.

It benefits us all, when you provide input and feedback on the OWASP
discussions and projects.
This chapter will only become succesful if you participate.=20
=20
I am personally not looking for "ready-made" presentations, although
they can be helpful.
I am asking you:=20
1) your opinion on what should be done during the next chapter
meeting(s)?
Should we elaborate in more detail on current OWASP projects?
Do we create local sub-groups that take on specific topics such as e.g.
Belgian awareness sessions, Legal projects for Belgian Law?
Do we organize a Q&A session on novice topics, or on expert topics?
How do we liaison with Belgian universities or high-schools to put
application security on the curriculum?
etc...
2) to take one of these or your own topic and do something with it
during the next meeting: presentation, Q&A, workshop, sub-group, ...
3) Testimonials on how OWASP material (could have) helped you with your
particular job or project are also highly welcome
=20
I am extending the period for proposals/ideas/remarks to Sunday Dec 4th.
If I have not received enough feedback to set up the next OWASP meeting
on Dec 12th we will have to postpone the chapter meeting to next year.
=20
Only together can we do this.
=20
Thank you
=20
With kind regards,
=20
Seba

Hi,
 
Thank you for your responses!
 
Attached you will find the results and first analysis of the poll of
last week.
 
My findings are:
1) 19% of the subscribed members answered within 2 days. Which I think
is a good result.
After New York, New Jersey, Seattle, Italy we are the 5th biggest
chapter in the world and 2nd biggest chapter outside the US after Italy
(87 members).

2) We have a nice mix of novice and experts. 
This supports a dual track approach for the chapter meetings: an
introduction part and a session with advanced content.
 
3) Suggests that we should indeed be aiming for at least 3, maybe 4
sessions a year.

4) 5 people were considering to give a presentations. This looks
promising; we should succeed in organizing chapter sessions with at
least one chapter member preparing a topic. We could additionally invite
external speakers as well.
 
I am looking forward to your opinion on the above results.
 
I would also propose to start next year with an informal New Years Drink
in January: 
Thursday evening 19th of January ok for everybody?
Are there suggestions, or sponsors :-), for a venue?
 
Best wishes for you and your family in 2006 !
 
Kind regards,
 
Seba

Subject: [Owasp-belgium] [Owasp-world] Happy Holidays from OWASP
Message-ID: <064601c60127$9dbc6640$3604a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

To all the OWASP participants worldwide,

 

 As 2005 comes to an end I want thank you all for making OWASP a success!
With a growing membership and skyrocketing downloads we are making a real
difference in finding and fighting the causes of application security
vulnerabilities.

 

Through your hard work in 2005, OWASP has released a completely overhauled
Guide, powerful new features in WebScarab, and hosted two successful AppSec
conferences. Our downloads have more than doubled to over 16,000 every
month, our unique visitors have doubled to almost 35,000 every month, and
our bandwidth requirements have soared 600% to over 18GB per month.

 

Our New Jersey chapter has arranged for a Holiday discount for OWASP
participants.  From now through December 31st, get 30% off any books you
order through http://www.oreilly.com/buy. Just use Discount Code HOHOHO when
you place your order.

 

Have a wonderful Holiday season and best wishes for the New Year.

 

--Jeff
