Good Day folks:
 
I am planning to return to the Albany area this summer and hope to have a  
speaker for a meeting to be held late summer. I have had some health issues  
which prevented me from returning sooner. 
 
Any way - Justin Giboney a new professor at SUNY - Albany is performing  
academic research and will be asking if you would complete a short survey. It 
is  entirely voluntary.
 
Justin may be providing us with a place to meet, which is great.
 
Look forward to seeing you later this year. 
 
Thanks very much!
 
Very Best Wishes
 
Susanna Bezold CISSP CISA CISM
OWASP Albany NY Chapter Leader and Founder

Thank you Susanna for the introduction email. I am a new faculty member in the Digital Forensics program at the University at Albany. I am reaching out to security professionals in the area to try to make connections. As Susanna said, I can help arrange meetings on campus as well as promote OWASP with students. We also have a good group of top students if you need projects done or summer interns.

I also do research related to information security. In particular, I am looking for 40 security professionals to fill out a 15-45 minute survey. To reward you for your participation, we will enter you into a random drawing for one of four $15 Amazon gift certificates (there will be up to 50 people included in each drawing of four). The survey must be completed within two weeks of this email to be eligible for the raffle.

If you would like to participate, please follow this link: >> http://eller.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_bCvPn8LhYsWJ7x3 <<

Please pass this message on to any security professionals that you know.
