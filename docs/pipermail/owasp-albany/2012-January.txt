Hi Folks: My sincere apologies for the short notice. I sustained a back
injury the end of last week. I was hoping that I would be better. The
meeting for Wednesday is cancelled.

My plan is to reschedule the meeting for late February or early March on
Wednesday. I will post the date once it is confirmed.

Again my apologies.

Thanks very much!!

Sam, 
Why wait for the next meeting for a challenge?
Most of the work accomplished through groups like OWASP are done via forums, mail lists, etc.

So, with that said, whats the challenge?
