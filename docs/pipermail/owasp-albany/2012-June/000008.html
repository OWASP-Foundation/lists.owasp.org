<PRE> 
Our next meeting is June 20, 2012, 5:00 - 7:00 pm NYSTEC 540 Broadway 3rd  
Floor, Albany, New York.  
Since we will be serving refreshments, please RSVP no later than June 18,  
2012 to me <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-albany">_Susanna.Bezold at owasp.org._</A> (mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-albany">Susanna.Bezold at owasp.org</A>)   

I am pleased to announce Mr. Brian Miller, Product Line Manager, HP  
Enterprise Security will be speaking on the topic: Gray, the New Black: Gray-Box  
Vulnerability Testing.  
Brian Miller is the Product Line Manager of Enterprise Dynamic Security as  
part of the Enterprise Security division at Hewlett-Packard. In this role, 
Brian  is responsible for providing large scale dynamic security testing 
products for  organizations. Previously Brian held the position of Technical 
Product Manager  for dynamic security testing tools such as WebInspect, 
QAInspect, DevInspect  (hybrid), and AMP. Brian joined the HP team as part of the 
SPI Dynamics  acquisition in 2007. Prior to product management, Brian was a 
software developer  for 10 years and holds a B.S. from Kennesaw State 
University and is currently  obtaining an M.B.A. from the Georgia Institute of 
Technology.  
ABSTRACT:  
Over the years, two key techniques have emerged as the most effective for  
finding security vulnerabilities in software: Dynamic Application Security  
Testing (DAST) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST). While DAST 
and  SAST each possess unique strengths, the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of security testing 
is  thought to be &#8220;hybrid&#8221; &#8211; a technique that combines and correlates the 
results  from both testing methods, maximizing the advantages of each. Until 
recently,  however, a critical element has been missing from first 
generation hybrid  solutions: information about the inner workings and behavior of 
applications  undergoing DAST and SAST analysis.  
This presentation will introduce you to the next generation of hybrid  
security analysis &#8211; what it is, how it works, and the benefits it offers. It  
will also address (and dispel) the claims against hybrid, and leave you with a 
 clear understanding of how the new generation of hybrid will enable  
organizations to resolve their most critical software security issues faster and  
more cost-effectively than any other available analysis technology.  
Since we will be serving refreshments, please RSVP no later than June 18,  
2012 to me.  
Please feel free to contact me if you have questions.  
Special thanks to those at NYSTEC and HP.  
Thank you and look forward to meeting you.  
Susanna Bezold, CISSP, CISA, CISM Chapter Founder and Leader
