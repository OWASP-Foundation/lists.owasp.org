Our next meeting is June 20, 2012, 5:00 - 7:00 pm NYSTEC 540 Broadway 3rd 
Floor, Albany, New York.

 
Since we will be serving refreshments, please RSVP no later than June 18, 
2012 to me at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-albany">Susanna.Bezold at owasp.org.</A> 

I am pleased to announce Mr. Brian Miller, Product Line Manager, HP 
Enterprise Security will be speaking on the topic: Gray, the New Black: 
Gray-Box Vulnerability Testing.

 
Brian Miller is the Product Line Manager of Enterprise Dynamic Security as 
part of the Enterprise Security division at Hewlett-Packard. In this role, 
Brian is responsible for providing large scale dynamic security testing 
products for organizations. Previously Brian held the position of 
Technical Product Manager for dynamic security testing tools such as 
WebInspect, QAInspect, DevInspect (hybrid), and AMP. Brian joined the HP 
team as part of the SPI Dynamics acquisition in 2007. Prior to product 
management, Brian was a software developer for 10 years and holds a B.S. 
from Kennesaw State University and is currently obtaining an M.B.A. from 
the Georgia Institute of Technology.

 
ABSTRACT:

 
Over the years, two key techniques have emerged as the most effective for 
finding security vulnerabilities in software: Dynamic Application Security 
Testing (DAST) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST). While DAST 
and SAST each possess unique strengths, the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of security 
testing is thought to be &#8220;hybrid&#8221; &#8211; a technique that combines and 
correlates the results from both testing methods, maximizing the 
advantages of each. Until recently, however, a critical element has been 
missing from first generation hybrid solutions: information about the 
inner workings and behavior of applications undergoing DAST and SAST 
analysis.

 
This presentation will introduce you to the next generation of hybrid 
security analysis &#8211; what it is, how it works, and the benefits it offers. 
It will also address (and dispel) the claims against hybrid, and leave you 
with a clear understanding of how the new generation of hybrid will enable 
organizations to resolve their most critical software security issues 
faster and more cost-effectively than any other available analysis 
technology.

 
Since we will be serving refreshments, please RSVP no later than June 18, 
2012 to me.

 
Please feel free to contact me if you have questions.

 
Special thanks to those at NYSTEC and HP.

 
Thank you and look forward to meeting you.

 
Susanna Bezold, CISSP, CISA, CISM Chapter Founder and Leader
