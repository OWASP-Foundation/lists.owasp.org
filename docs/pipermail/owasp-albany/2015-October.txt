Hi Everyone,

We recently received a notice that Susanna will not be able to continue as
leader for the OWASP Albany chapter. We are seeking nominations for the
leadership position. Please contact me if you are interested.
Unfortunately, if we do not find a new leader, we will need to mark the
chapter as inactive.

I am posting the Volunteer job announcement to our website for this
position and will be reaching out to some of my contacts in Albany as well,
as I am in New York and know some people in the tech and govtech sectors
there.

Reach out to me. Let me ponder this.


Thanks

Message-ID: <14967b.41361723.435ac271@aol.com>

 
Good day  
As some of you know I have been in Virginia. Since it does not seem like I  
will be back in the area soon, I have resigned as chapter leader.  
Jim Manico offered to speak at a chapter meeting on Monday, November 16,  
20l5. I wish I could be there to hear his talk. For those of you who do not 
know  of Jim, he is an application security rock star and a board member of 
OWASP.  
I am in the process of arranging the meeting to be held at SUNY Albany 
early  evening. Usually refreshments are served. I will post again when I have 
more  details.  
Please let me know if you plan on coming so we can get a count.  
Thanks so much.  
Very best wishes to all.  
Susanna Bezold, CISSP, CISA, CISM Chapter Founder and Leader
