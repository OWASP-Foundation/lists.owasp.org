Hi Everyone,

I would just like to introduce myself, my name is Joseph Scaperrotta and I
am one of the new Albany OWASP Chapter Leaders.  Just to give you a quick
back story on myself, I graduated from SUNY Albany with a bachelors in
Informatics with a minor in business management and concentration in Cyber
Security.  I am currently a Project Manager at a Software Development
Company, Troy Web Consulting.  We are in the beginning phases of planning
our first Albany OWASP Chapter Meeting.  If you all, would not mind
responding to this email so I can get a head count of who is still actively
on this list, I would appreciate it.  I have also attached a google form to
this email which contains potential meeting topics and what YOU would like
to see out of the Albany Chapter going forward.  Please let me know if you
have any questions.  Thank you!

Hi Everyone,

I would just like to introduce myself, my name is Joseph Scaperrotta and I am one of the new Albany OWASP Chapter Leaders.  Just to give you a quick back story on myself, I graduated from SUNY Albany with a bachelors in Informatics with a minor in business management and concentration in Cyber Security.  I am currently a Project Manager at a Software Development Company, Troy Web Consulting.  We are in the beginning phases of planning our first Albany OWASP Chapter Meeting.  If you all, would not mind responding to this email so I can get a head count of who is still actively on this list, I would appreciate it.  I have also attached a google form to this email which contains potential meeting topics and what YOU would like to see out of the Albany Chapter going forward.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you!

Albany OWASP Chapter Form:

Regards,
Joseph Scaperrotta
