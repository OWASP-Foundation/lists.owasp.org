Hello,

I am looking to pay someone to help me improve the security of a web
application.

I attended a few Albany OWASP meetings when the group first started.

Please let me know if you are interested.

Regards,
Sam

Sam,
What are you looking to do exactly? I perform web application 
penetration tests on a regular basis.

Tyler,

Thank you for your response.

I have a web application built with Apache, MySQL, and PHP that has yet to
be launched. I don't want to launch it until it has been thoroughly tested.
I need a web security expert to do penetration tests and help reduce
security flaws. I am away on work until mid-June and would like to meet in
the Capitol Region to discuss.

Do you have examples of work you have done? What do you charge? How much
experience have you had with web security?

Regards,
Sam
