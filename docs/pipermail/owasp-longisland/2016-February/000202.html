<PRE>Hello OWASP Long Island Chapter;


First before anything else both Gary and I want to thank the Long
Island OWAP Chapter for being willing to have a working session on
reviewing the work of the Code Review Guide team. I know it's much
more exciting to learn new hacking techniques or procedures to prevent
it. Nevertheless, reviewing the book is a very much-needed effort and
Gary and me very much appreciate everyone in New York taking the time
to do this.

I also want to give out a big shout of thanks to Ken Belva for help in
pushing both Gary and myself to get the document ready for everyone.
Last but not least we both also want to thank Helen Gao and Charles
Beganskas.

The document is divided into two main sections. One section covers the
why (reasons for doing secure code reviews) and how. This section main
focus is IT management and project leads.

Second sections deal's with vulnerabilities. It is based on the  OWASP
top 10.  Here you will find most of the code examples for both on what
not to do and on what to do. A word of caution on code examples; Perl
is famous for its saying that there are 10,000 ways to do one thing.
The same is true for C#, PHP, and Java or any other computer language.
Now add in &quot;Object-Oriented Programming&quot; and if we are using design
patterns or even what designs patterns are being used and sample code
becomes very &#8220;iff&#8221; in what to write. We tried to keep the sample code
so code reviews can see red flags and not &#8220;do it my way or else&#8221; but
if you see code like example was given then it needs to be fully
vetted in the code review process.

The last big section is the appendix. Here we have content like code
reviewer list, etc. of items that really don&#8217;t flow in book form but
needed to be included to make the code review guide compete.

One thing we have tried to do is to have the code review guide flow as
a book than a collection of separate articles based on a major topic.

We have a small amount of content that is not in the code review
guide. Both Gary and I are working on completing this. What is end the
code review guide now is content that is complete except for editing
and peer review.

What Code Review Guide needs the following is a peer review.

- Review grammar, spelling.
- Review content that is easily understandable and not complex to be
understood and or followed.
- Code is correct.
- No outdated code or components.  i.e code sample shows.Net, Java,
PHP of release that is at least 8 years old in how current software is
being written.  This is very subjective. A good example is java struts
where java struts 2.0 would be coded entirely different.
- Missing content. Did we exclude or gloss over some content that
needs to be included? We can&#8217;t include everything or we would never
get done but if you feel we need to include something please say so.
- Everything not included above. Honestly, we are looking for good,
usable feedback and we are thick skin. We are not looking for anyone
to gloss over and tell us we did a good job.

Larry and Gary Code Review Guide.
