Subject: [OWASP-LongIsland] OWASP LI Upcoming Meetings Survey
Message-ID: <721658092696409DAEF7CF432E015A71@net2s.lan>

Hello All,

We've had great feedback regarding the June 27th OWASP LI meeting.  Thanks
to all who could attend.  We strive to make sure that OWASP LI can provide
as many people with the most relevant topics possible.

Please take the time to fill out the following survey.  It should take no
longer then 5 minutes to complete.  We will use this data to help plan
upcoming meetings.

http://fs18.formsite.com/owaspli/form589827174/index.html

The survey will remain open for roughly a week.


The OWASP LI board is planning a meeting for roughly 5 weeks away.  We will
send an announcement when appropriate.

If anyone has any questions or concerns that they wish to discuss please
feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for your time.

Kindest Regards,

Blake Cornell
Board Member, OWASP NYNJ/LI
