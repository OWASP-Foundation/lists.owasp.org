*Who Are We*:  We are volunteers of
OWASP&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page</A>&gt;
.  The Open Web Application Security Project is a 501c3 not-for-profit
worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of
application software. Our mission is to make application security visible,
so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true
application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all
of our materials are available under a free and open software license.

*What to do at the Meeting*: Three knowledgeable information security
professionals will show you how to secure your organization and protect your
clients.

*1.      Rajendra Umadas, OWASP Member - Intro to the OWASP Mobile Project*

The OWASP Mobile Project is in its infancy, but has generated a lot of
interest in the security and mobile development communities. Recently,
delegates at the OWASP Summit in Portugal started laying the ground work to
help guide the project through its inaugural year. One of the objectives for
this year will be to ratify the current, unofficial OWASP Mobile Top 10
List. This presentation will do a deep dive into the current list, citing
real world examples of insecure mobile applications.

*2.      Dan Guido, OWASP NY/NJ Board Member - The Exploit Intelligence
Project*

In 2011, mass malware is still the most common source of compromise on
corporate networks. Bots like Zeus, Gozi, and Clampi successfully infect
devices despite organizations carefully managing disclosed vulnerabilities
and subscribing to detailed analysis of the latest malware families.
Existing efforts at malware prevention focus broadly on vulnerabilities and
their impact yet ignore the means by which they are exploited and the
motivations, opportunities and capabilities of attackers, which has allowed
this problem to become worse year-after-year.

In this talk, I introduce an intelligence-driven approach to malware
defense, focusing on attacker's capabilities and methods, with data
collected from the most popular crimeware packs currently deployed
in-the-wild. This analysis identifies the means by which exploits are
developed and selected for inclusion in crimeware packs, identifies defenses
that are outside the capability of malware exploit writers to bypass, and
helps attendees evaluate not just the exploitability, but the probability of
a vulnerability being exploited. This study shows that, until crimeware
packs substantially advance in sophistication, only a few simple defensive
tactics are required to protect users from such opportunistic threats.

*3.      Ryan Behan &lt;<A HREF="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ryan-behan/9/746/a12">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ryan-behan/9/746/a12</A>&gt;,

WebScarab &lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project</A>&gt;Demo
/ Web Vulnerabilities Intro WebScarab is a framework for analyzing
applications that communicate using the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is
written in Java, and is thus portable to many platforms. WebScarab has
several modes of operation, implemented by a number of plugins. In its most
common usage, WebScarab operates as an intercepting proxy, allowing the
operator to review and modify requests created by the browser before they
are sent to the server, and to review and modify responses returned from the
server before they are received by the browser. WebScarab is able to
intercept both HTTP and HTTPS communication. The operator can also review
the conversations (requests and responses) that have passed through
WebScarab.

In this demo we'll use WebScarab against some emulated vulnerabilities
developed by Blake Cornell.

*Free pizza and beverage will be provided. After event networking will be
held at a local bar.*

Bio of Raj


Raj Umadas is a Consultant with the Intrepidus Group. Mr. Umadas graduated
Summa Cum-Laude from The Polytechnic Institute of NYU with a BS in Computer
Engineering. At NYU:Poly, Mr. Umadas pursued a highly expansive computer
security curriculum. He is just as comfortable sniffing out a memory
corruption bug as he is assessing the risk management decisions of large
projects.

Coupled with Mr. Umadas' fresh academic outlook on security, he obtained a
no-nonsense business sense of security while working in an Information Risk
Management arm of a large investment bank. Corporate governance, segregation
of duties, and SOX compliance were all daily concerns for Mr. Umadas.

Mr. Umadas is eager to establish his own niche in the security world where
he will be the catalyst of some very major innovation. With his strong
academics, provfdsafen real world experience, and never-say-no attitude; it
is only a matter of time.

Bio of Corey



Corey is a Principal Consultant with the Intrepidus Group, specializing in
mobile application security. He has performed code reviews and conducted
mobile application penetration tests for numerous Fortune 500 clients on a
multitude of platforms, such as Android, BREW, RIM, and iOS. He has worked
with nationwide telecommunication companies to help ensure the security of
wireless architectures, systems, and applications. Corey has previously
written code for both enterprise grade web applications and personal mobile
devices.


Prior to joining Intrepidus Group's professional services team, Corey served
as a Senior Consultant at Foundstone. During his tenure at Foundstone, he
was an integral part of their assessments practice, and played a key role in
developing and teaching their training courses.


Corey is a polished public speaker and has been invited to speak at leading
conferences like Black Hat, OWASP, NYCBSDCon, and Infragard, on various
topics including mobile application security. In addition, his expert
opinion has been published in industry publications like eWeek. He has also
published several whitepapers on cutting edge security issues, like
vulnerabilities in AJAX, and the security implications of web browser data
caching.

Corey has an undergraduate degree from Boston University and attained his
Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification in
2005.
