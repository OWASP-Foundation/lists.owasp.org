   Ken Johnson

   Abstract: While working to secure rails applications in a truly Agile
   development environment, it became clear that the Rails and Ruby ecosystem
   needed attention from the security community in the form of free and open
   training, and the events that have transpired within the last few months
   have only reinforced that belief. RailsGoat is an attempt to bring
   attention to both the problems that most frequently occur in Rails as well
   as the solutions for remediation. To accomplish this, we've built a
   vulnerable Rails application that aligns with the OWASP Top 10 and can be
   used as a training tool for Rails-based development shops.


   Jack Mannino

   Abstract: Like it or not, your developers copy and paste code and
   &quot;borrow&quot; ideas from open source projects. This presentation will detail the
   results of analyzing over 100,000 Android applications available publicly
   on GitHub. We will examine the most prevalent frameworks and libraries in
   use and discuss their implications for security. Our focus is less
   theoretical and more practical based on what developers are actually doing
   and using within their apps. From there, we will take a deeper look at
   common vulnerabilities that are systemic throughout the Android application
   ecosystem. We will look at specific examples of vulnerable real-world
   applications, and fix code on the fly.
