OWASP&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page</A>&gt;,
a worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of
application software.  Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of

*Meeting Agenda:
*

*Helen Gao - Cross-site scripting, the most prevalent. Web application **
vulnerability**:*
Helen will discuss one of the most widespread Web application
Vulnerabilities.  How can an application be attacked and how to protect
yourself.

*About the Speaker -* Helen Gao has worked in the field of information
security since 1991. Helen has worked as an application developer, project
manager, and software architect. Her employment history includes working at
a financial institution, a market research company, a high-tech device
manufacturer and a software company.  Helen is currently a senior architect
at TIBCO Software Inc. Her job duties include the design and development of
complex event processing software. The protection of information security in
such systems is challenging, due to their strict performance requirements in
terms of high event throughput and low processing latency. Helen welcomes
the challenge and uses the knowledge she obtained from OWASP to manage
project life cycles.



*Round Table Discussions Coordinated by Ryan Behan:*
Topics -

   - Recent Attack on Infraguard Website.
   - Security as a Service Model vs. Internally Managed Security -Five
   years from now, what will IT look like?
   - LulzSec, Anonymous, A-Team - Motivations for attacks?  How do
   small-medium size businesses protect themselves from this?  Insurance,
   increased IT budgets?

*About the Speaker -* Ryan Behan is the Director of Internal IT at Netsmart
Technologies Inc.  He is a strong proponent of information sharing,
application security and improving business agility through automation and
scalable infrastructure.
