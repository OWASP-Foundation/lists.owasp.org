We are working hard to raise $6,000 to send two women to attend the
conference and training classes. Thanks to Jim Weiler and the Boston
chapter, Ryan Behan and the Long Island chapter, and friends in iSEC, we
have already raised $4,000!

We will start the call for entries soon. If you or your female colleagues

Hi, all.

Do you know that Women in AppSec

conference in New York city for free, including airfare and hotel
accommodation. The regular price for registration and training classes is
about $2,500.

Qualified women are professionals, students and faculties in the field of
application security. If you or somebody you know are interested then submit
an application<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/forms/d/1WEtInvzlxLDXpTgfXh-E1E7e8H5FRfEOPIaTOizlBpk/viewform?edit_requested=true>by
Sept. 9, 2013.

Half of the funding are raised among OWASP members. Our heartfelt thanks go
to Boston Chapter <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston>, Ireland Dublin
