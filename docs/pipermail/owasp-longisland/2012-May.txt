In the meeting of May and June, LILUG has a two session meeting that help each attendant get a real GPG key.

For details, please visit http://lilug.org/wiki/Lilug

For those who missed the first session, you have a chance to catch up by following the instruction here: http://lilug.org/wiki/May_2012_GPG_Key_Generation_and_Collection.

Note it is very important to complete this homework BEFORE the Memorial Day weekend, as instructed, in order to have your signed key on the June's meeting.

Please feel free to ask any questions.

- Yujin
