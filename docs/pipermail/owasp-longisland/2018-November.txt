All,



We?ve officially made publicized the BsidesLI conference this morning.
At this point we?re looking to spread the word about: Sponsors,
Volunteers and Speakers:



Speakers (CFP): http://www.bsidesli.org/cfp/

Sponsors: http://www.bsidesli.org/#sponsors

Volunteers: http://www.bsidesli.org/volunteers/



Thank you for your help right now. We?re looking to make a push with
these three now over the next couple weeks. Let me know if you have
any questions, but our priorities should be getting sponsors and
speakers. If you have contacts in either direction, please let me
know, or guide them to our site.



Thanks,

Matt
