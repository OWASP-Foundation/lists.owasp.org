OWASP LI Specialists,


Join Rajendra Umadas, Senior Security Architect, Canary(canary.is) for
an enlighting evening discussing a bug bounty as part of your security
program.


So you are thinking about using a bug bounty as part of your security
program. From running an entire program internally, to leveraging some
managed services or platforms, getting involved with a bug bounty
program could seem quite daunting. Lets talk about some lessons I've
learnt seeing it done both at Etsy and Canary.


When:
Wednesday, November 9th, 2016 @ 7:00 PM

Where:
LaunchPad LI (Huntington) | 2nd Floor
315 Main Street
Huntington, NY 11743

Full meeting details:

Networking will begin at 6:30 PM, if you would like to come earlier.


We look forward to seeing everyone!


Yours truly,
