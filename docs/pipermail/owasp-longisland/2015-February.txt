OWASP LI Members,

Mark your calendar for our March Chapter Meeting!

Gabriel Gumbs will join us to provide an overview of the WhiteHat
Security Website Security Statistics report. He will focus on
discussing unknown vulnerabilities in custom Web applications. Based
on the lessons learned at his day job, Gabe will introduce his new
OWASP project called the "The OWASP Application Security Program Quick
Start Guide". This guide is intended to be a short, straightforward
introductory guide to standing-up or improving an Application Security
Program. The Quick Start Guide is a true OWASP project and it can be
found at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Application_Security_Program_Quick_Start_Guide_Project.

Please RSVP if you plan on attending so that we can get an accurate headcount.

When: Wednesday, March 4, 2015 6:30 PM
Where: Adelphi University, Garden City Campus
1 South Avenue
Garden City, New York 11530
