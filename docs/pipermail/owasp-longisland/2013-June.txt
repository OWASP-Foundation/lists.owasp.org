Subject: [OWASP-LongIsland] The new OWASP Top 10 is now officially released
Message-ID: <CABCuideOfpFEB9q_exAG_fK_TcdLRa8aADbNLA4eVi3xZh-TRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

The OWASP Top Ten provides a powerful awareness document for web
application security. The OWASP Top Ten represents a broad consensus about
what the most critical web application security flaws are. Project members
include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared
their expertise to produce this list. Versions of the 2007 and 2010 Top 10
were translated into English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Turkish
and other languages. Translations for the 2010 version are posted here and
translation efforts for the 2013 version are underway and will be posted
here as they become available.

The final version of the OWASP Top 10 for 2013 is available here: OWASP Top
10 - 2013<http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf>

The OWASP Top 10 - 2013 is as follows:
A1 Injection
A2 Broken Authentication and Session Management
A3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
A4 Insecure Direct Object References
A5 Security Misconfiguration
A6 Sensitive Data Exposure
A7 Missing Function Level Access Control
A8 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
A9 Using Known Vulnerable Components
A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

We urge all companies to adopt this awareness document within their
organization and start the process of ensuring that their web applications
do not contain these flaws. Adopting the OWASP Top Ten is perhaps the most
effective first step towards changing the software development culture
within your organization into one that produces secure code.

The Release Candidate for the OWASP Top 10 for 2013 is available here: OWASP
Top 10 - 2013 Release
Candidate<http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013%20-%20RC1.pdf>

2010 edition:

A4 Insecure Direct Object References
