 Glass - Meeting tonight at Adelphi

Hello.


I would like to invite you and your colleagues to the OWASP chapter meeting.



   - *Date & Time:* Wednesday, October 15, 2014 from 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM
   (ET)
   - *Location:* Adelphi University 1 South Avenue? Garden City, NY 11530.
   Direction details are below.
   - *RSVP Requested
   <http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Long-Island-Meetup/events/198775852/>*
   - *Topics: Android Wear and Google Glass*

Android Wear and Google Glass introduce new ways of interacting with our
apps and receiving timely, contextual information from the world around us.
Smartphones and tablets are becoming the central point for sending and
receiving data from wearables and sensors. Building apps for a wearable
world introduces new risks as well as shifts the responsibilities for
implementing security controls to other layers.

   - *About the Speaker:*

Jack Mannino is the CEO at nVisium and loves solving problems in the field
of application security. With experience building, breaking, and securing
software, he founded nVisium to invent new and more efficient ways of
protecting software. Jack is a huge fan of contributing to open source
projects, and leads the OWASP Northern Virginia chapter. In his spare time,
he loves to kick around new frameworks and technologies, especially things
that run Android. He?s also an optimistic Mets fan, although that optimism
slowly fades away every summer.

   - *Directions:*

Once you are on campus, please proceed to the Training Room in the Lower
Level of New Hall A. The Nassau Boulevard LIRR train station is within
walking distance. For travelers arriving early a shuttle bus will depart
the train station at 5:45PM and bring you to campus. Parking is available,
but it may take a little while to find a good spot. Parking field 7 is your
best shot. Direction to campus
