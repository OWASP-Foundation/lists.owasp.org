Good Evening Members!

On May 10th, 2012 @ Adelphi University we'll be having our next chapter
meeting.  Jack Mannino will be our guest speaker discussing mobile
application security.  We've had some great turn outs the last few meetings
and hope to see more of you there.  I also wanted to take a moment to thank
Adelphi University for hosting this event as well as Kees Leune for being a
great presenter and host for the last two meetings.

Best Regards,
     Ryan Behan

Hi Ryan,

I just registered online. I also corrected a typo to Date: Thursday, May
10, 2012.  Has Jack sent you the bio and description? Are you going to send
reminder emails, preferably with the RegOnline link? This meeting is a hard
to come by opportunity for chapter.

Could you tell me if the event is on OWASP calendar?

Thank you very much.

Hi Ryan,

Just want to let you know that i am still waiting for your response. We
need to send a meeting reminders *2 wks, 1 wk & 1 day before the event. If
I don't get your response then I will send the reminders.*

Thanks.
