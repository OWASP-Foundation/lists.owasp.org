Helen,

It appears that the New York, Long Island chapter since June 2007 has
gone inactive and we would like to help.

Please give me a call to discuss how we can get your chapter back on
track with speakers/venues - and if any of the members of the chapter
would like to comment or step-up to a leadership role, please review
the chapter leaders handbook:
