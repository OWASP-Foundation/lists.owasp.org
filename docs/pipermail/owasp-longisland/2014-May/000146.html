<PRE>Hello.

I have some exciting news for you. In the brainstorm meeting on April 28,
2014, we all agreed that we will organize more meetings and discuss
security subjects that matter the most to you. These meetings will be held
in convenient locations in Nassau as well as Suffolk. In addition to free
food and drink, free beer will also be served.

All eight attendees of the meeting are from Long Island. Each presented
his/her unique perspective. Four of them had volunteered to become a chapter
board member&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Long_Island#tab=Chapter_Board_Members_and_Contacts">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Long_Island#tab=Chapter_Board_Members_and_Contacts</A>&gt;.
The main duties of the board are to select interesting topics, invite
inspiring speakers and organize meetings. Board members are not paid and
not allowed to advertise his/her products or services.

The heartbleed bug will be the main topic of our next meeting. The
tentative date is Wednesday June 18, 2014. It will be held in the office of
Secure Decisions in Northport.

Meetings will be held on the 3rd Wednesday every other month. If there is a
schedule conflict then you will be notified by email. Please send me your
suggestion for topics and speakers. Encourage your friends to colleagues to
