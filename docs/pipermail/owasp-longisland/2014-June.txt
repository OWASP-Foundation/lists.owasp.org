Location: &lt;b&gt;TIBCO Software Inc&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;200 Garden City Plaza Bld. #220&lt;br /&gt;Garden City, NY 11530&lt;br /&gt;

Date & Time: Wednesday, June 18, 2014 from 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM (ET)
Location: TIBCO Software Inc. offices 200 Garden City Plaza #220 Garden City, NY 11530
Topics: Heartbleed
Heartbleed Abstract:

The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing the information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS encryption used to secure the Internet.
The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.

About the Speaker:

Tom Brennan has been a volunteer to the OWASP Foundation since 2004 when he founded the New Jersey Chapter after serving on the Board of Directors for the FBI Infragard program in New Jersey. The NJ OWASP Chapter later merged with the New York City Chapter in 2006 creating OWASP NYC Metro Chapter. Tom was appointed to the Global Board of Directors in 2007 by his peers and was re-elected by the membership for another term.
During his leadership within the OWASP Foundation, he has led many global and local initiatives for OWASP. Tom holds many industry certifications since he began his technical journey in 1983 including the (ISC)?? CBK / CISSP and many others.
Tom is also the founder of proactiveRISK

I got this mail from Long Island Linux User group mailing list.
In case someone can help ...

Subject: [Lilug] Zimbra Mail Server.

OK, I'm done pulling my hair out.....

I'm running a Zimbra mail server version 8.0.7 on a 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04.  About a month ago, I found out that the server is being used to send out SPAM.  Immediately, I started locking down whatever I found was a potential problem and asked all the users to change their passwords.

Every time I think I'm making progress, I see a burst in my message count at odd times of the day.  Like the spammers are laughing at my efforts.

I have run rkhunter and closed any potential issues.
I have installed fail2ban but there still appears to be extended attempts by script kiddies to access services
I have installed policyd to try to limit incoming and outgoing traffic, but don't think that that is effective either.

I have been blocking ip' using ufw but that is always an exercise in futility.

Could use some help from a Mail Server, Postfix Guru.

Anyone interested in assisting?  Any reasonable compensation will be considered.  Please contact me off list.

-- Michael

Good afternoon All,

I'm happy to see the Long Island Chapter of OWASP is growing!
My client here in Long Island is looking to bring on a security engineer who specializes in vulnerability management.
We are looking for someone that has a knowledge of vulnerability scanning tools like WhiteHat, Veracode, and/or Qualys.
My client has a team off site doing the scans and is looking for someone that can analysis the scans and create solutions.
My client has tripled the amount of applications in their environment and has already brought on 2 engineers.
We are looking for one more engineer that can handle the task at hand.
The person needs to have experience with both application and network security best practices and solid understanding of OWASP Top Ten.

I'm leaning on you to possible ping your networks and see if anyone is even passively entertaining new opportunities.


Please feel free to reach out to me directly via email or 631-760-3108.

Keep up the good work,
Dennis

	Cybersecurity
Message-ID: <CABCuideNsz4wO2AP5tw_aybeW+QS1312rg-KB8gxRVvz42ipWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, OWASP folks.

A recent websense report showed that 79% of respondents from United States
say their company?s leaders do not equate losing confidential data with a
potential loss of revenue. No wonder incidents like LinkedIn, TJ Maxx and
Target keep happening.

    [image: Websense]    *Survey: Global Security Pros Find Themselves
?Deficient, Disconnected and In-the-Dark?*
[image: Ponemon Report]Do you ever wonder how your cybersecurity peers feel
as they navigate today?s threat landscape?
Are they confident of stopping crippling data theft?
Can they access the defensive technologies they need?
Do they feel supported and understood by executives?
The first report of a two-part Ponemon Institute survey, *?Exposing the
Cybersecurity Cracks: A Global Perspective,?* answers these and other
questions facing you and your global colleagues as you strive to protect
your organizations from cybercriminal activity.
Consider these survey results a wake-up call.

Overview
Researchers surveyed 4,880 IT security pros from 15 countries and found:

   - A deficit in security solution effectiveness.
   - A disconnect between company executives and perceived value of
   data loss.
   - Limited visibility into cybercriminal activity.

*The researchers share their findings and provide helpful recommendations
for responding to and preventing cyber attacks.*

Location: TIBCO Software Inc. offices 200 Garden City Plaza #220
Garden City, NY 11530
Register: Free food and drinks will be provided. RSVP required. Click Here
Topics: Heartbleed
Heartbleed Abstract:

The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL
cryptographic software library. This weakness allows stealing the
information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS
encryption used to secure the Internet.The Heartbleed bug allows
anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by
the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the
secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the
traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content.
This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data
directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and
users.
