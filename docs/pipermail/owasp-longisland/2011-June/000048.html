<PRE>Dear all,

The OWASP board election is around the corner.  As a matter of fact, today
is the last day to declare ones candidacy.

Anybody can participate at OWASP, but only paid members can vote.  So now is
the best time to become an official member and have your voice heard at the
election.  Click here for how to vote, who is running,
etc.&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2011Election">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2011Election</A>&gt;
Here &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2011Election/questions">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2011Election/questions</A>&gt; is
a list of questions people have asked of candidates.  Don't see your
question?  Add it to the list!

The membership fee is $50 for the whole year.  Click here to
donate&lt;<A HREF="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;SESSION=l1uzYTG7AsTUr8Qqfx554sUEsXDg_Re9o9ASh5xhUoNsCADe1pa78YfeNVO&amp;dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d422be6d275c375afb284863ba74d6cdc">https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&amp;SESSION=l1uzYTG7AsTUr8Qqfx554sUEsXDg_Re9o9ASh5xhUoNsCADe1pa78YfeNVO&amp;dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d422be6d275c375afb284863ba74d6cdc</A>&gt;.
Please make Long Island is displayed as your local chapter.  40% of your
donation will be used to purchase refreshment at our chapter meetings.  Your
donation is 100% tax deductible.  Some employers match the charitable
donation of their employees.  Ask if yours does the same.

Currently there are more than 1,000 members worldwide.  More than 100 of
them are new.  I look forward to seeing your name on the
list&lt;<A HREF="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p6IFyntQTi7sxa2Xjx191BA">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p6IFyntQTi7sxa2Xjx191BA</A>&gt;of
proud supporters.

Best regards,

Helen Gao
