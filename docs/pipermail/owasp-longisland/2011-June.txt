 OWASP Mobile Security Project Call For Volunteers

The OWASP Mobile Security
Project<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Project>
is pleased
to announce a call for participation to help shape the OWASP Mobile Top 10
Risks. This ?Top 10? initiative is intended to help organizations determine
how to best apply development and security resources to better protect their
mobile applications and data.


In order to compile the most thorough and universally accepted guidance
possible, we are reaching out to software developers, security consultants,
and thought leaders from all industries to participate. This includes
independent developers and consultants, startups, large consultancies, and
large development companies. If you have an interest in mobile application
security and the expertise to contribute, we invite you to get involved with
this initiative. The OWASP organization is built on openness and
transparency, and our vision is for this initiative to adhere to these very
same high standards. Participation is open and highly encouraged for all.


We are breaking this initiative into three distinct phases. Each phase will
build upon the previous phase's achievements and outputs, helping to refine
our data set as we progress. The phases are broken down as follows:


*Phase I (6/2/2011- 6/30/2011)*

   - Survey to obtain recommendations for promotion, demotion, and removal
   within current risks
   - Suggestions for new candidates to consider for inclusion in the final
   Top 10 Risks
   - Survey can be found here: Mobile Top 10 Risks
Survey<https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dGNRclMxQ3FaMWd3N1A1c0tDX2otM1E6MQ>


*Phase II (7/7/2011- 8/4/2011)*

   - Compile all information from Phase I
   - Release new set of candidates for consideration
   - Rate and rank candidates using the official OWASP Risk Rating
   Methodology<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology>
   - Provide metrics and supporting information


*Phase III (8/11/2011- 9/8/2011)*

   - Compute and compile Phase II information
   - Create Top 10 release candidate list
   - Release list to Phase I and II participants for feedback
   - Perform final revisions and solicit final feedback before official
   release


While participation is open to all, we will be enforcing one rule:
participation in Phases II and III is dependent upon participation in all
phases. We are pursuing aggressive time lines, and in order to promote an
orderly and focused effort, the project's leadership felt that this would be
the best way to achieve it. Therefore, we ask that if you wish to be heavily
involved in this initiative, that you plan accordingly based on the proposed
time lines above.


We thank all of you in advance for your participation and hard work in
making this initiative a success. Your participation will be noted and
recorded when compiling the list of contributors for the final release of
the Mobile Top 10 Risks documentation.


If you have questions regarding this initiative, please contact the project
leaders listed on the main page.
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Project>  We
also encourage you to join the mailing
list<https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-mobile-security-project>
 and My OWASP groups<http://myowasp.ning.com/group/owaspmobilesecurityproject>
in
order to collaborate with other participants.


Sincerely,
OWASP Mobile Security Project Leadership


*Jack Mannino*
