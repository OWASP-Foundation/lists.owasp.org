Register nowFor many years now, SQL injection has been classified as the #1 risk on the web. It remains in the top spot to this day and continues to be the avenue through which hacktivists and career criminals alike wreak havoc. Even in today&#8217;s modern frameworks, we still see an enormously high prevalence of what is now a very well-known, yet often replicated, risk.In this webinar, Pluralsight author Troy Hunt will take you through the mechanics of how a SQL injection attack works. He'll look at different styles of attack and leave you with a sample application to experience first hand. Plus, you'll get a sneak peak at Troy's new Ethical Hacking course on injection and how it can help prepare you to defend against this most destructive of risks.About the authorTroy Hunt is a Microsoft MVP for Developer Security, ASPInsider, and Author for Pluralsight. Troy has been building software for browsers since the very early days of the web and possesses an exceptional ability to distill complex subjects into relatable explanations. This has lead Troy to become an industry thought leader in the security space and produce more than seven top-rated courses for Pluralsight. Currently, Troy is heavily involved in Have I been pwned? (HIBP) a free service that aggregates data breaches and helps people establish potential impacts from malicious web activity. As the author of the eBook and series OWASP Top 10 for .NET Developers and creator of the Automated Security Analyser for ASP.NET Websites (ASafaWeb), Troy blogs regularly about web security and is a frequent speaker at industry conferences and throughout the media to discuss a wide range of technologies.
