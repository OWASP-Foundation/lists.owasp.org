*&#8203;&#8203;Call for Speakers*

*&#8203;&#8203;Submission Deadline August 6, 2015 *

The Coalition of organizations forming the NY Metro Joint Cyber Security
Conference (NYMJCSC) is looking for seasoned speakers to present at our
second annual conference.

The NYMJCSC 2015's program aims to provide Insights into Cyber Security
News/Trends, along with sharing practical applications in Legal, Forensics,
Audit, and Programming.

This conference also is aligned with the National Cyber Security Awareness
Month (NCSAM) activities and seeks to reach a broad audience.

Our conference will be a conference aligned with an in-depth security
workshop. If you are a seasoned IT security practitioner, want to share
your recent experiences and lessons learned on the trenches, and have
excellent communication skills, we would like to showcase your expertise at
this event.

*&#8203;&#8203;Conference Topics*
Topics of discussion should fall into one of the following tracks:


   - Emerging News &amp; Trends
   - Forensics
   - Audit
   - Application Security
   - Legal / Regulatory / Standards


*&#8203;&#8203;Submission Requirements*

Our audience looks for real-world solutions to real-world problems.
Sessions should have actionable take-aways or case studies of organizations
that created a strategy or solved a problem. It must be objective and
vendor neutral.

*&#8203;&#8203;No proposal from a vendor organization related to its product offerings
will be considered. *

All selected speakers will receive:


   - A complimentary speaker registration to the event
   - Exposure in the conference program materials and on the conference
   website


Please be sure that your submission includes:

   bullets stating the takeaways for attendees)

   - Have you given this presentation before, or do you plan to deliver it
   at any other conference prior to NYMJCSC?
   - Desired session length (60 minutes, 75 or 90 minutes)
