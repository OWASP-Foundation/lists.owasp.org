Subject: [OWASP-LongIsland] Chapter Meeting Date Announcement
Message-ID: <CABMX-MMDi2pJ-_bt_Uv9t4wy0rc3p46A4QSjQgXu+TzCihFFyA@mail.gmail.com>

Good Morning OWASP!

     I wanted to drop a quick note, we've posted upcoming chapters meetings
for September and December.  If anyone is interesting in a summer meeting,
please contact me and we can discuss.  I hope everyone had a healthy and
reflective Memorial Day weekend.  For those who have been loyal attendees,
have you thought about full member? Being a member helps not only show that
our chapter is growing but you can donate dollars from your membership to
help pitch in for items such as a venue/food/shwag for our chapter.

Chapter Site:  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Long_Island

Best Regards,
     Ryan

Hello,

Have you heard of Stuxnet? Whether your answer is yes or no, this New York
Times article may give you new info on Bush and Obama's secret weapon
against the Iranian's nuclear program.

What is amazing is the base flame environment is 20 Megabytes!   In
comparison most malware starts at 10k and grows to 100k to 300k even after
it pulls down its tagalong malware that pays for its botnet.   Looking at
the string comparison of FLAME was insightful to its construction and
forensic origin.

LinkedIn asked all users to change their password asap. But I am afraid the
damage is beyond LinkedIn. I use the same password for my email, other
social network websites and who knows what else.

I like to share these links in case some of you are interested in them:
1.  A very good video session:
Malware Hunting with the Sysinternals Toolshttp://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012/SIA302
2. Picnic event (Long Island Linux User Group) - a good opportunity to social with other IT professionals in Long Island.
Location:  Bethpage State Park Picnic AreaDate: 7/28/2012The detailed plan is still evolving.  I believe it will eventually be post on http://lilug.org/wiki/Lilug
3.  Long Island Drupal User Group Meeting on 7/11.  If you are using or plan to use Drupal, I think you will like it:
