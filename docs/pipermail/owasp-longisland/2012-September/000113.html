<PRE>Hello OWASP folks,

Are you running Internet Explorer 8 and below? A critical vulnerability has
been found.  Upgrade or apply the update provided free by
Microsoft&lt;<A HREF="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms11-003">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms11-003</A>&gt;.
 Below is one of the related reports.
Be safe,

*Java zero-day leads to Internet Explorer zero-day*

Summary: Following the trail of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in
Java led one security researcher to discover a new zero-day vulnerability
in Internet Explorer.
By Michael Lee &lt;<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/au/michael.lee/">http://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/au/michael.lee/</A>&gt; | September
17, 2012 -- 01:29 GMT (18:29 PDT)

While looking around a compromised server that was being used to exploit
Java vulnerabilities&lt;<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/java-zero-day-skyrockets-blackhole-exploit-success-rates-7000003467/">http://www.zdnet.com/java-zero-day-skyrockets-blackhole-exploit-success-rates-7000003467/</A>&gt;,
a security researcher stumbled upon another exploit that he claims affects
fully patched versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer 7, 8 and 9.

Eric Romang found four files on the
server&lt;<A HREF="http://eromang.zataz.com/2012/09/16/zero-day-season-is-really-not-over-yet/">http://eromang.zataz.com/2012/09/16/zero-day-season-is-really-not-over-yet/</A>&gt;:
an executable, a Flash Player movie and two HTML files called exploit.html
and protect.html

When users visit the exploit.html page, it loads the Flash movie, which in
turn loads the other HTML page, protect.html. Together, they help drop the
executable on to the victim's computer. At this point, attackers have
everything they need to drop whatever applications they like on the
victim's machine, whether it is to join a botnet or conduct attacks. In
this case, the dropper executable installs another program when the victim
next logs in.

Romang discussed the zero-day with other security researchers, who also
came to the same conclusion that this was a vulnerability in Internet
Explorer.

However, Romang's presence has not gone unnoticed by those behind the
exploit. Shortly after Romang discovered the zero-day, the exploit authors
removed the files from the server, replacing them with a text file
containing Romang's Twitter handle, &quot;eromang&quot;. They also removed the
previous Java exploit that was on the server.

The vulnerability has also been picked up by developers working on the
Metasploit exploit framework, and an early version of a module exploiting
the zero-day has already been created.

*Updated at 8.57 a.m. on Tuesday September 18, 2012 AEST (3:57 p.m. on
Monday September 17, 2012 PT):** Clarified that IE9 is vulnerable.*
