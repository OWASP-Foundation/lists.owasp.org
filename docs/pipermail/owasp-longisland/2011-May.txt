I'd like to jump in on this one.  I'm not formally a member, but would 
be interested in attending a meeting to see what it's all about.  
Unfortunately, between the "lawn", soccer practice, etc..., the weekends 
are usually pretty hectic for me.  Any chance of a future meeting being 
held during the week?

Thanks

a worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of

*Meeting Agenda: *

   - ***Robert Gezelter - Minimum Necessary Implementation: Reducing Attack
   Surface increase Security**
   *

*Ensuring the security and integrity of web-based applications is a constant
challenge. Web-based applications are inherently customer-facing, and an
attractive avenue of attack. However, vulnerability is often unnecessarily
increased by poor technology choices. Different technologies have different
degrees of vulnerability. ActiveX creates a higher exposure than Java or
JavaScript, which in turn has more potential for abuse than simple CSS.
 Some approaches (e.g., unguarded SQL queries) are particularly vulnerable
to attack (e.g., SQL injection); other approaches unnecessarily create
exposures by requiring unrestricted trust (e.g., ActiveX).**
*
Judicious division of responsibilities between clients and servers is
another aspect of the same problem, as clients are inherently less-trustable
than servers.

We will examine how using the minimum necessary technology reduces attack
surface, decreases vulnerabilities, and decreases costs.

About the speaker - Mr. Gezelter *has more than 30 years of international
consulting experience on architectures, protocols, and implementation
techniques in both the private and public sectors.  He has spoken widely at
conferences throughout the United States and internationally.  He has also
published numerous technical papers and book chapters, including two
chapters in the Computer Security Handbook, 5th Edition and two chapters in
the Handbook of Information Security. He also publishes Ruminations - An IT
Blog on a variety of topics relating to Information Technology and systems
architect
