in convenient locations in Nassau as well as Suffolk. In addition to free
food and drink, free beer will also be served.

All eight attendees of the meeting are from Long Island. Each presented
his/her unique perspective. Four of them had volunteered to become a chapter

From: helen.gao at owasp.org (Helen Gao)

Subject: [OWASP-LongIsland] You are invited to the OWASP meeting on
	Wednesday 6/18/14 6:30 - 9:30pm
Message-ID: <CABCuidd48_3XK_nEQUcm0Nh2EZsfix7cf+i9vk3AEDYxK_fE8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I am excited to announce that Tom Brennan is come to speak at our chapter
meeting. Tom will talk about Heartbleed, a bug that rocked the Internet
recently. The story is still unfolding.


   - *Date & Time:* Wednesday, June 18, 2014 from 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM
   - *Location:* TIBCO Software Inc. Suite 220. 200 Garden City Plaza
   Garden City, NY 11530. Directions
   <https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=200++Garden+City+Plaza,+Garden+City,+NY+11530&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x89c27d7c971cb6db:0x3b25e3102c9f3ded,200+Garden+City+Plaza,+Garden+City,+NY+11530&gl=us&daddr=200+Garden+City+Plaza,+Garden+City,+NY+11530&ei=yIRUUcqLI5HE4AP2sYGACg&ved=0CC4QwwUwAA>
   - *RSVP *- Online RSVP will be set up soon.
   - *Topics:* Heartbleed <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Heartbleed_Bug>
   - *Abstract*: The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the
   popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. This weakness allows
   stealing the information protected, under normal conditions, by the SSL/TLS
   encryption used to secure the Internet. SSL/TLS provides communication
   security and privacy over the Internet for applications such as web, email,
   instant messaging (IM) and some virtual private networks (VPNs).  The
   Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the
   systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This
   compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to
   encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual
   content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data
   directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.


   - *About the Speaker: *Tom Brennan is volunteer to the OWASP Foundation
   since 2004 when he founded the New Jersey Chapter
   <http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-New-Jersey/> after serving on the Board of
