<PRE>Hello OWASP folks,


I was asked this question many times, &quot;why should someone become an OWASP
member?&quot; The answer to the question will be loud and clear in October.
Members, and only members can vote in the election which will take place
from October 12 to 19, 2012.



OWASP board makes large and small decisions from what the membership fee
should be, which projects to fund, whether volunteers should be paid, and
if there will an OWASP summit this year. Half of the 6 seats will be
determined by less than 2,000 members in the whole world.



If you receive this email then you are one of the OWASP leaders who care
about the direction OWASP is going. What better way to let your voice be
heard by exercising your vote in the election? If you are not current
member yet then what better time to become one or
renew&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership_Map">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership_Map</A>&gt;
?



248 individuals joined OWASP in July, and 55 renewed their membership. Don't
be left behind. Act today &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership_Map">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership_Map</A>&gt;!

details of the election including candidates and timeline,  .
