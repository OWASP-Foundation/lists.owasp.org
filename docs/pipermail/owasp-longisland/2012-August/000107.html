<PRE>Hi OWASP folks,

Do you use Dropbox? Do you work for a company that provide cloud service
like Drobox? You might to read this report from CIO
Insight&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Latest-News/Spam-Campaign-Caused-by-Stolen-Dropbox-Employee-Password-344694/?kc=CIOMINUTE08032012STR1TOC">http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Latest-News/Spam-Campaign-Caused-by-Stolen-Dropbox-Employee-Password-344694/?kc=CIOMINUTE08032012STR1TOC</A>&gt;
.

An employee's account was accessed without authorization, allowing an
attacker to access a project document with user email addresses, according
to Dropbox.

Cloud-based storage provider Dropbox came clean with more details today
about a security breach that led to a spamming campaign.

The company's investigation into the incident revealed that usernames and
passwords stolen from other Websites were used to sign in to a number of
Dropbox accounts, including one belonging to a Dropbox employee that
contained a &quot;project document&quot; with user email
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cioinsight.com/#">http://www.cioinsight.com/#</A>&gt; addresses.
According to the company, the document is believed to have been used to
launch the spam campaign.

Following the breach, Dropbox users in Holland, Germany and the United
Kingdom began reporting on a Dropbox user forum that they were receiving
spam for gambling sites. The ensuing complaints led to suspicions that
Dropbox had been hacked.

In a blog post&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.dropbox.com/index.php/security-update-new-features/">http://blog.dropbox.com/index.php/security-update-new-features/</A>&gt;,
Dropbox engineer Aditya Agarwal apologized for the situation and said the
company is putting additional controls in place to prevent future breaches.
In particular, the company plans to adopt two-factor authentication as an
optional way to prove identity when users are signing in. This will be
coming in a few weeks.

In addition, the company has added new automated mechanisms to help
identify suspicious activity, a new page that lets users examine all active
log-ins to their account and required password changes if it is commonly
used or hasn't been changed in a long time.

&quot;At the same time, we strongly recommend you improve your online safety by
setting a unique password for each Website you use,&quot; Agarwal blogged.
&quot;Though it s easy to reuse the same password on different Websites, this
means if any one site is compromised, all your accounts are at risk. Tools
like1Password &lt;<A HREF="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">https://agilebits.com/onepassword</A>&gt; can help you manage
strong passwords across multiple sites.&quot;

Users whose usernames and passwords were stolen from other Websites have
been notified, Agarwal added.

The email addresses on the project document were apparently not obfuscated
or encrypted.

This breach illustrates the downside of not having rigorous access controls
in place around sensitive data, said Todd Thiemann, senior director of
product marketing for Vormetric.

&quot;A document containing lots of customer email addresses would seem to be
quite sensitive and require protection &lt;<A HREF="http://www.cioinsight.com/#">http://www.cioinsight.com/#</A>&gt;,&quot; he
said. &quot;So encrypting this file after it leaves the database is a security
best practice. Companies need to re-evaluate what constitutes sensitive
data. While email addresses may not be regulated like credit card data, the
damage caused when these are stolen can be as great as or greater than
impact associated with stolen credit card numbers.&quot;

The incident also serves as a lesson not to use the same password for
multiple sites, said Stephen Cobb, security evangelist at ESET.
