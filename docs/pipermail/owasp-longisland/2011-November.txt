Subject: [OWASP-LongIsland] Summary of the last chapter meeting
Message-ID: <CABCuidfOb2o10OpQeP89Zshc2yVFchq3_fmb-9NDQxpOQMKbzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

We just had one of the most informative and engaging chapter meetings last
Friday in Adelphi University. Dr. Kees Leune, an infosec expert and
instructor led this hands-on lab. Participants experienced first hand the
most critical risks of web applications. The meeting also marked the first
joint event of OWASP and IEEE. Before long it was already 10pm. We decided
to continue this fun and learning experience in the next meeting sometime
in January. Stay tuned>

Warm regards,

Helen Gao, CISSP
