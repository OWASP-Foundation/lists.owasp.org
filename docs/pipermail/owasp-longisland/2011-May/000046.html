*Who Are We*:  We are volunteers of
OWASP&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page</A>&gt;
.  The Open Web Application Security Project is a 501c3 not-for-profit
worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of
application software. Our mission is to make application security visible,
so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true
application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all
of our materials are available under a free and open software license.

*What to do at the Meeting*: Bob Gezelter and Blake Cornel will ??Two
information security professionals will show you how to secure your
organization and protect your clients.

   - ***Robert Gezelter - Minimum Necessary Implementation: Reducing Attack
   Surface increase Security**
   *

*Ensuring the security and integrity of web-based applications is a constant
challenge. Web-based applications are inherently customer-facing, and an
attractive avenue of attack. However, vulnerability is often unnecessarily
increased by poor technology choices. Different technologies have different
degrees of vulnerability. ActiveX creates a higher exposure than Java or
JavaScript, which in turn has more potential for abuse than simple CSS.
 Some approaches (e.g., unguarded SQL queries) are particularly vulnerable
to attack (e.g., SQL injection); other approaches unnecessarily create
exposures by requiring unrestricted trust (e.g., ActiveX).**
*
Judicious division of responsibilities between clients and servers is
another aspect of the same problem, as clients are inherently less-trustable
than servers.

We will examine how using the minimum necessary technology reduces attack
surface, decreases vulnerabilities, and decreases costs.

About the speaker - Mr. Gezelter *has more than 30 years of international
consulting experience on architectures, protocols, and implementation
techniques in both the private and public sectors.  He has spoken widely at
conferences throughout the United States and internationally.  He has also
published numerous technical papers and book chapters, including two
chapters in the Computer Security Handbook, 5th Edition and two chapters in
the Handbook of Information Security. He also publishes Ruminations - An IT
Blog on a variety of topics relating to Information Technology and systems
architect

   - Blake Cornell - Google Gruyere: Practical training for penetration
   testers

Gruyere is Google's version of OWASP WebGoat.  It privdes a testing
environment for people to test their penetration testing skills.  Its
designed to contain almost every flaw there is.  We will go through Gruyere
and have a group discussion and find some vulnerabilities.

About the speaker - Blake Cornell has been an IT innovator and developer
with over a decade of experience within software and security. He has
consulted Fortune 500 companies and various law enforcement agencies with
hopes of enacting solutions to ease every day issues. He currently has
vested interests within network and application security with as well VoIP
technology. He is a proud member and supporter of InfraGard, a partnership
between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the private sector, and
OWASP, the premier application security consortium.

He has spoken at or is scheduled to speak at Briarcliffe College (Bethpage,
NY), Astricon 2007 (Pheonix, AZ), The Last Hope (New York, NY), ICCS
2009/2010 (New York, NY), HIMSS Virtual Conference, regional OWASP events,
FRHack, Fordham University, LIPHP, Rutgers University and Astricon 2010.
