Helen will discuss one of the most widespread Web application
Vulnerabilities.  How can an application be attacked and how to protect
yourself.

security since 1991. Helen has worked as an application developer, project

complex event processing software. The protection of information security in

terms of high event throughput and low processing latency. Helen welcomes
the challenge and uses the knowledge she obtained from OWASP to manage
project life cycles.



*Round Table Discussions Coordinated by Ryan Behan:*
Topics -

   - Recent Attack on Infraguard Website.
   - Security as a Service Model vs. Internally Managed Security -Five
   years from now, what will IT look like?
   - LulzSec, Anonymous, A-Team - Motivations for attacks?  How do
   small-medium size businesses protect themselves from this?  Insurance,
   increased IT budgets?

*About the Speaker -* Ryan Behan is the Director of Internal IT at Netsmart

Subject: [OWASP-LongIsland] FYI - Rouge Google SSL certificate will
	facilitate MITM attacks
Message-ID: <CABCuiddUMaGOy7EjuhSVFC=ijsnO1y5=yTwvg6J9+Zsr4-Xnzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OWASP folks,



If you have not updated your browser recently, you might consider doing so
as soon as possible.  The reason is there are rouge SSL certificates out
there that can man-in-the-middle attack your access to Google and other
popular websites.


Both Chrome or FireFox have been modify to detect the rouge certificate.
Here<http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/08/update-on-attempted-man-in-middle.html>
is
the advisory from Google and a related article in
F-Secure<http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002228.html>.
 It's still unclear how many such rouge certificates had been issued by this
CA called Diginotar.  So pay attention to the browser warnings.

Enjoy your holiday weekend.

Helen Gao
