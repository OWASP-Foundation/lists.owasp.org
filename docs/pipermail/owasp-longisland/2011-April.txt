Hi, Tom.

Thanks for the suggestions.

The topic is shown as TBD, to be determined, only because we want to count
everybody's opinion.  All our previous meetings have very interesting
speakers and topics, and I believe this one will be the same.  Two speakers
have volunteered.  We keep our options open because a smaller group like
ours can be very flexible.

The meeting is on a Saturday because most people prefer it.
