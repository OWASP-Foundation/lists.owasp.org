Hi Kees,
I'd be glad to spread the word -- I had been holding back because I didn't
want to overwhelm the space you had.  At last meeting you mentioned you had
other facilities.

I'm waiting to hear about a project and once I get the good word, I will
use that as a platform to increase awareness in Long Island Cyber Defense
including OWASP, Infragard, etc.   While I am active in Infragard,it is not
all about cyber defense (maybe one session have eight to ten sessions) and
I like the relentless approach that OWASP Long Island takes -- it is much
more suited for my style.

Recently, many Hosting companies has raised problems with Parallels PLESK
web management environment.   Are you interesting in having more
information about this?   I have been gathering and testing hosting company
responses to threats, ability to analyze client PHP / PLESK servers,
responses to assist customer (other than just shutting them down) if they
become compromised, etc.

Larry

OWASP Leaders,

The global conferences committee is pleased to announce a design contest
for the next OWASP conference presentation template.  Many of you have
mentioned that the old template (
https://www.owasp.org/images/5/54/Presentation_template.ppt) is looking a
bit dated, and we agree!  So we've launched a design contest on
freelancer.com at
http://www.freelancer.com/contest/New-presentation-template-for-the-OWASP-Foundation-5302.html.


After 7 days the submissions will be reviewed by the
conferences committee and a winner selected to get $190 in prize money!

Good luck!
