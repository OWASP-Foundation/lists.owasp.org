Subject: [OWASP-LongIsland] First Meeting of the Long Island Cyber Defense
	Consortium
Message-ID: <CABCuiddToAJZhzdAFKOmJD5umBcdywGSmDN6RCc9=zPgX2uoBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Long Island folks,

NYIT Hosts First Meeting of the Long Island Cyber Defense
Consortium<http://www.nyit.edu/about_nyit/news/nyit_hosts_first_meeting_of_the_long_island_cyber_defense_consortium/>

*Old Westbury, N.Y. (Feb. 26, 2013)* - Yesterday, New York Institute of
Technology (NYIT) hosted a meeting initiated by Congressman Steve Israel
(D-Huntington) of what initially is being called the ?Long Island Cyber
Defense Consortium? intended to position Long Island as a ?center of
excellence? if not the cyber defense capital of America.

During the meeting, it was recalled how Long Island became the defense
capital of America during World War II, and today, the region is in a
position to take the lead in defending America again, based on the
collective expertise and competence concentrated in the area through
institutions of higher education, private industry, the utilities sector,
government labs, and the leading players in technology and energy, among
others, many of whom attended the meeting.

Rep. Israel said, ?I am extremely appreciative of New York Institute of
Technology?s willingness to host the first meeting of the Long Island Cyber
Defense Consortium. As one of Long Island?s premier educational
institutions, we are lucky to have such a priceless resource in our own
backyard. As this consortium moves forward, we anticipate NYIT playing a
pivotal role.?

The initial goals of the group are to:

   - Inventory the cyber defense capabilities of Long Island businesses and
   institutions.
   - Mobilize those capabilities and match them to the needs of federal
   cyber security entities and put Long Island at the forefront of protecting
   America against cyber attacks.
   - Seek federal support for the creation of a cyber security hub on Long
   Island.

 Representing NYIT at the meeting were Peter C. Kinney III, Chief of Staff;
and Nada Marie Anid <http://www.nyit.edu/experts/nada_anid/>, Ph.D.,
Dean, School
of Engineering and Computing Sciences <http://www.nyit.edu/engineering>.

?We are pleased to be part of a project that is so vital to the
competitiveness and safety of our nation,? Anid said. ?Our faculty, who
have tremendous expertise to contribute to this important initiative, are
winning prestigious research grants in many areas relating to cyber
security, and we look forward to being an active and collaborative member
of the consortium.?

It is a poor state of affairs for Ling Island and the various so called
security minded organizations that instead of 30 days notice of upcoming
cyber security meetings, we get post event sound bites.
