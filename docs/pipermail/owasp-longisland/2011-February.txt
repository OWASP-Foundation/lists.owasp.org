**Over 180 application security experts from over 120 companies and 30
different countries attended the summit in Lisbon, Portugal.  The Summit was
a significant step towards OWASP?s mission to ensure all types of
organizations are empowered to protect software applications.



OWASP launched and advanced dozens of concrete initiatives to bring
application security to governments, educational institutions, browser
vendors, standards bodies, software development teams, and mobile platform
vendors.

The next Long Island chapter meeting is around the corner.  Details will be
sent to you soon.

Dear all,

Congratulations to Adelphi University on becoming an OWASP supporter.

Dr. Kees Leune is both a professor and an information security officer in
Adelphi.  He has provided meeting facilities as well as unique insight into
infosec in an acadamic insitituion.  Thank you, Dr. Kees.

There is a lot of material suitable for universities and colleges scattered
around the OWASP webpages.  This is currently a focus of OWASP.  You can
find some of the presentation material
here<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Education_Presentation>.
I wish the information is more centralized.  Many attendees shared my
opinion at the recent OWASP Summit.  I'll keep you posted on the progress.
