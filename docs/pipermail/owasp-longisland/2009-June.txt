This email is to announce the birth of the sister chapter of OWASP
NY/NJ Metro that has started in Long Island. Having been raised on the
east end of Long Island it should be its own state ;)   Anyway I
wanted to help raise awareness alert the NY/NJ Metro mailing list with
a 1x alert to members.

The first meeting is June 27th and point you to the Long Island
Chapter Wiki page for further information:

*Agenda:*

 10-00 - Opening Remarks & Welcome to OWASP
Foundation<http://www.owasp.org/images/9/9f/2009-OWASP_KeyNote-V2.pdf>
--*Helen Gao, OWASP LI Board * 10-20 - Incident Response - Identify,
Contain, Eradicate, Recover, Lessons Learned Breaches happen. Proper audit
compliance enables an organization the ability to detect and prevent
attacks. A case study will be examined. --*Ryan
Behan<http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ryan-behan/9/746/a12>Manager of
Network Technologies at Netsmart
Technologies <http://www.ntst.com/>* 11-20 - Code Blue - The Unhealthy State
of Your Medical Records (And What Can Be Done to Save Them) Millions of
patient records have been disclosed to unauthorized third parties. Some of
these records were stolen, some were lost yet all could have been prevented.
A North Carolina hospital loses a laptop with 14,000 records. The Peninsula
Orthopedic Associates lost backup tapes that help 100,000 patient records.
The Wallgreens Health Initiative emailed 28,000 records to the state of
Kentucky without using encryption. Confiker infects three University of Utah
hospitals. Kaiser fires 15 employees for inappropriately accessing medical
records. Two Scottish hospitals were infected by a computer worm.
Researchers find 20,000 medical records using peer-to-peer software. The
Mytob worm infects 4,700 computers at three UK hospitals. Confiker infects
8,000 computers at the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Trust. Criminals tried
to extort Express Scripts with the threat of releasing millions of patient
records. SRA International was breached when malicious software allowed an
attacker the ability to access patient data maintained by SRA. The list goes
on. All of these incidents were reported in the news within a five month
period of each other. News like this is being reported with an increasing
frequency. Most of these incidents could have been easily avoided by
conducting compliance audits and vulnerability assessments. --*Blake

- Lunch
12-25 - Education, "So you want to train an army of ninjas..." - Teaching
offensive techniques to college students Dan will discuss the challenges,
successes, surprises, and lessons learned creating and delivering a
penetration testing course for undergraduate and graduate students at
NYU:Poly. The course, which ran on-campus during the Fall 2008 semester, was
taught to 30 students and with the help of 5 instructors from outside the
university: After 6 weeks, students were given a takehome midterm that
tested their ability to apply theoretical techniques discussed in class and
that tracked the evolution of their "hacker's mindset." This talk presents
lessons learned as "design patterns" that conference attendees can apply to
their own courses to increase their effectiveness and train their own army
of ninjas in a university setting. Additionally, all course material,
videotaped lectures, and student work from the Fall 2008 NYU:Poly
Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis course have been made freely
available online at: [1] <http://pentest.cryptocity.net/> --*Dan
