We are looking into this. It is unclear who is listed as the mailing list
owner, who needs to approve the requests for membership.

NOTE: the group link is
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/long-island-chapter

We added the people who were listed in Salesforce as the project or chapter
leaders to the new Google Groups as owners of that group.

In the case of the Long Island chapter, that is Frank Zinghini & Charles
Beganskas - where they had @owasp.org addresses, these were used by default.

If that's not accurate for this chapter, please work with Dawn to update
the chapter information by submitting a case using the "Contact Us" form
<https://www.tfaforms.com/308703>.

Cheers!
