Hello.

Many websites have revoked or will revoke their SSL certificates due to the
Heartbeat bug. Browsers will protect you using OCSP, Online Certificate
Status Protocol, but only if you tell them to check. Below is how to set up
your browsers to check if a certificate has been revoked.

Chrome:
Click on menu *Settings*.
On the bottom of the page click on *Show advanced settings*.
Make sure this is checked: *Check for server certificate revocation*.

Firefox:
Click on menu *Tools* then *Options*.
On the pop-up, click on *Certificate* tab, then click on *Validate* button.
On the pop-up, make sure this is checked: *When an OCSP server connection
fails, treat the certificate as invalid*.

Internet Explorer:
Click on menu *Internet Options*.
On the pop-up, click on *Advanced* tab.
Scroll down to *Security* and make sure this are checked: *Check for
publisher's certificate revocation* and *Check for
server certificate revocation*.

Safari:
Open *Applications -> Utilities -> Keychain Access. *Under Keychain Access
menu,
Select Preferences...
Select the Certificates tab
Set "Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)" to "Best Attempt"
Set "Certificate Revocation List (CRL)" to "Best Attempt"
Set "Priority" to "OCSP"

How do you know if you have done it right? Just click on this link,

Subject: [OWASP-LongIsland] Applied Visions is our first Silver Chapter
	Supporter!
Message-ID: <CABCuidfRaAUKL9biFWFcDS7kDVQjKHsmZ89CtLJGkK4rAe+6nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Great news. Secure Decisions just became our first Silver Chapter supporter!

Secure Decisions has donated $500 to the chapter. Director Dr. Anita
D'Amico said this generous gesture "was motivated by the tremendous value
we have been getting in our interactions with OWASP." President Frank J.
Zinghini, Jr. promised to become more active and offered to host our next
meeting in their Northport office.

Secure Decisions <http://securedecisions.com/> is a division of Applied
Visions Inc <http://www.avi.com/>.

Message-ID: <CABCuidf0yksfz-_rLAzpDnKW=fvCPJmn0h_O94QU_9=5ZFGwyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

What do you want to do in our next meeting? Talk about mobile security,
secure coding practice, or dissect the heart to see where it
bleeds<http://www.xkcd.com/1354/>
?

Our chapter meeting is long overdue, partly my fault. I wish I could devote
more time. Currently the chapter has only 2 board members including myself.
Ryan has been vital to the chapter but he withdrew after he moved out of
the island.

If you have the time and interest, why not join the board? Dr. Kees Leune
and I would like to get together with you to brainstorm how to bring more
benefits to security minded folks on Long Island like you and me.

Reply to this email if you want to participate in the brainstorm meeting.
We will find a convenient time and location.

Feel free to past this message among your friends and colleagues. Subscribe
to the chapter mailing list to get notices for future
meetings<http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-longisland>

Regards,
