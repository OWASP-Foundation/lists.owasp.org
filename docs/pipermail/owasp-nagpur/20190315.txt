Subject: [Owasp-nagpur] UPDATE: The Owasp-nagpur mail list will be retired
	on March 22nd
Message-ID: <201903151740.x2FHe6C6022797@lists.owasp.org>

Sorry to intrude on your mail list again but I need to remind the Owasp-nagpur list members that the OWASP Foundation is shutting down all the mail lists run by Mailman on lists.owasp.org on March 22, 2019. This is the 2nd of 3 notifications to all list members.

Here is a one-click link to join the new Google Group which is replacing this list:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/nagpur-chapter/join

You can also join by sending an email to nagpur-chapter+subscribe at owasp.org

The new Group is also available online at:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/nagpur-chapter

Detailed Information on how join the Group is at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA

NOTE:  You are NOT required to have a Google account, an @owasp.org email address, or to provide your phone number to join and participate in the new Group at nagpur-chapter at owasp.org - just an email address.

Finally, full details on the plan to retire Mailman, links and FAQs are  at: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL

Thanks for your past and future contributions to our community!
