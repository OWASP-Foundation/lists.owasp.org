*IoT *fuels next-gen law enforcement

Growing federal investments in the internet of things -- including cloud,
analytics and sensor technologies -- will power physical and cybersecurity,
a new study shows.

https://gcn.com/articles/2017/05/11/iot-law-enforcement.aspx
?s=gcntech_120517 ? building a border wall or increasing the number of
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can ?engender good will with
voters? who are focused on border security, he encouraged law enforcement
officials to invest more in cloud-based solutions or risk ?losing the
battle.?? In terms of IoT growth, software applications and cloud spending
increased the most between FY 2015 and FY 2016, up by 39.8 percent and 34.5
percent, respectively.  Spending on border security and port-of-entry
devices had the sharpest decline (6.8 percent) during the same time
period?Cloud storage investments led federal law enforcement agencies'
spending in the cloud space, increasing by 73 percent from FY 2015 to FY
2016.  Infrastructure as a service grew by 38.9 percent over that same
period, followed by cloud migration at 38 percent.  Since more companies
are investing in cloud analytics to make use of the data, Govini expects
platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service investments to be the next
large category of cloud spending?.

Homeland Security Issues Warning on Cyberattack Campaign

The Department of Homeland Security is warning IT services providers,
healthcare organizations and three other business sectors about a
sophisticated cyberattack campaign that involves using stolen
administrative credentials and implanting malware, including PLUGX/SOGU and
RedLeaves, on critical systems? "Command and control primarily occurs using
RC4 cipher communications over port 443 to domains that change IP
addresses. Many of these domains spoof legitimate sites and content, with a
particular focus on spoofing Windows update sites. Most of the known
domains leverage dynamic DNS services, and this pattern adds to the
complexity of tracking this activity."? https://music.amazon.com/home/
browsePanel/bhh-2

?DHS in its alert notes: "All organizations that provide IT services as a
commodity for other organizations should evaluate their infrastructure to
determine if related activity has taken place. Active monitoring of network
traffic for the indicators of compromise ... as well as behavior analysis
for similar activity, should be conducted to identify command and control
traffic."?

*Title: Containers and Security*

*Abstract: *Customer trust and security is paramount for any organization.
While containerization is great for DevOps due to flexibility, speed,
isolation, transient existence, ease of management and patching, it becomes
a challenging environment when the sensitivity level of the data traversing
the environment increases.  Monitoring systems, applications and network;
performing disk, memory and network forensics in case of an incident; and
vulnerability detection can easily become daunting tasks in such a volatile
environment. In this presentation, I would like to discuss uses of
containers and suggestions on how to secure them in the DevOps cycle.



*Bio: *Cem specializes in cloud computing security, system security
architecture, vulnerability management, incident response, digital
forensics, R&D of security software. Prior to Salesforce he led security
R&D and information security teams in Terremark, Verizon, LinkedIn and
various Fortune 500 companies. He has presented at conferences such as,
RSA, Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST.org), Hack In the
Box, Open Source Memory Forensics Workshop (OMFW) and has written articles
about cloud computing security and incident response for various
publications. While not being paranoid about security, he tries to find new
ways to have fun with his friends and family. Mahalo!

Government in conjunction with the current and planned suite of NIST
security and privacy risk management publications. The specific guidance
was derived from current Cybersecurity Framework use. To provide federal
agencies with examples of how the Cybersecurity Framework can augment the
current versions of NIST security and privacy risk management publications,
this guidance uses common federal information security vocabulary and
processes.

NIST will engage with agencies to add content based on agency
implementation, refine current guidance and identify additional guidance to
provide the information that is most helpful to agencies. Feedback will
also help to determine which Cybersecurity Framework concepts are
incorporated into future versions of the suite of NIST security and privacy
risk management publications. NIST would like feedback that addresses the
following questions:

   - How can agencies use the Cybersecurity Framework, and what are the
   potential opportunities and challenges?
   - How does the guidance presented in this draft report benefit federal
   agency cybersecurity risk management?
   - How does the draft report help stakeholders to better understand
   federal agency use of the Cybersecurity Framework?
   - How does the draft report inform potential updates to the suite of
   NIST security and privacy risk management publications to promote an
   integrated approach to risk management?
   - Which documents among the suite of NIST security and privacy risk
   management publications should incorporate Cybersecurity Framework
   concepts, and where?
   - How can this report be improved to provide better guidance to federal
   agencies?

Project Summit Belfast Recap

OWASP had another successful project summit at AppSec Europe Belfast. The
Project Summit is a combination project working session and program
improvement session for OWASP Projects. In addition to presenting their
projects
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/6b257c645d/usp=sharing>
to the summit, the leaders discussed ways for their projects to collaborate
and there was a proposal from one leader to combine two existing projects
with some additional work into a new third project. Project leaders were
very excited about up coming improvements to OWASP and Projects, including
Discourse, Project Handbook changes and gamification options that will be
soon available.

In addition to focusing on programmatic changes and their projects, leaders
and other community members came together to review seven applications for
projects wishing to graduate to the next level of project maturity.

Apps with Bytecodeviewer."

Our Day 2 morning session topic was ?"?Automating On-Deploy Security
Testing* of web applications with ZAP and Jen?"? hosted by Spyros
Gasteratos. We had 21 people attend this session.

Chapter Leader Workshop

Before every Global AppSec Event we host a Leaders? Workshop. These
workshops serve to allow the foundation staff (and board) to hear from
Chapter and Project Leaders and to catch them up on big occurrences in the
OWASP Foundation. This year there was an unusually large portion of the
meeting dedicated to sharing information from the Foundation.

The OWASP Staff have been analyzing the Foundation?s technical debt and
engaged in deep listening activities to understand how to prioritize our
actions. This activity has led to the staff prioritizing 4 large changes to
our structure: The Website Reboot, the AMS update, a new system for mailing
lists, and a volunteer management program. These new systems will bring
more insight and control to Project and Chapter Leaders.

The Leaders? Workshop is recapped in three blog posts: OWASP Leaders?
Workshop Pt 1: 4 Major Changes and Leader Insight and Control
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/58b2c8c94e>,
about the 4 major updates; OWASP Code Sprint 2017
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/ff829869a1>,
answering the question about the code sprint; and Chapter Questions from
the LW, discussing the other two questions leaders brought up:
(1)Discussion on move from 2 to 4 meetings per year, (2)What does the
foundation look at when judging if an event can be charged for or not? The
final blog post is not yet up.

We have also confirmed that future Leaders? Workshops will attempt to
include the webinar platform so that Leaders who are not attending the
event can still participate in the meeting.
