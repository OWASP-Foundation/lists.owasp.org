The Largest Application Security Conference Offers Something for Everyone


AppSecUSA is the largest conference solely dedicated to application
security. Unlike similar conferences which only offer speaker sessions,
AppSecUSA also offers cutting edge trainings conducted by leaders in the
field, opportunities for women and those transitioning from military
service to network and develop their careers, and significant discounts for
students to learn about security careers.


Below are a few of the many ways guests can participate at AppSecUSA and
take advantage of the holistic content available.


Trainings to Prepare the Next Generation of Cybersecurity Experts

AppSecUSA kicks off with two full days of hands-on training sessions led by
the industry?s leading software security experts. Attendees will learn
useful tactics such as: penetration testing techniques used to test
individual components of a control system; assessing SAP platforms for
platform-specific vulnerabilities and exploit them to better understand the
involved business risk; how to exploit iOS and Android applications
providing an in-depth knowledge about the different kinds of
vulnerabilities in an mobile applications; and how to implement scalable
and effective security for rapid-release applications.

Additionally, attendees can participate in the AppSec Safari that takes
participants on a guided tour of cross-site scripting, SQL injection,
privilege escalation and more. If you?re an application developer or
security practitioner who is looking to solidify your theoretical
knowledge, you won?t want to miss the Safari!

Diverse Speaker Line-up

AppSecUSA speakers come from all walks of life and are experts in a wide
array of information and application security topics. From renowned white
hat hackers to trusted educators and government employees working to
protect the nation?s critical assets, attendees have abundant opportunities
to learn about and debate today?s cybersecurity hot topics. Here are just a
few speakers we have in store:


Corry Doctorow, renowned novelist, activist and journalist will discuss the
intersection of DRM and security research.


Samy Kamkar, researcher, hacktivist and entrepreneur will discuss how he
uses side channels, physics, and low cost tools to employ powerful attacks
against modern technology.


Casey Ellis, co-founder of Bugcrowd, shares best practices for implementing
an effective bug bounty program.


Advancing Women in App Sec

OWASP?s Women in AppSec (WIA) initiative encourages female students at the
undergraduate and graduate levels, instructors, military personnel
transitioning out of service, and professional working women to expand
their skills and pursue a career in application and/or information security.


WIA has exciting events in store for AppSecUSA 2016, including a network
reception to meet like-minded industry professionals and make connections
to help launch or expand your career in the security industry, and a
mentoring luncheon to engage with mentors in the field and learn from
experts what it takes to develop your career.


WIA is also offering sponsorships for women transitioning from development
and security-based jobs in the military to attend AppSecUSA.


All This and Much More?

In addition to the fascinating opportunities above and our usual Maker and
Breaker talks, AppSecUSA is hosting speaking tracks dedicated to Mobile,
IoT,  and Rugged DevOps. The event will also offer opportunities for
developers and project managers to test their knowledge and participate in
educational hands-on trainings.
