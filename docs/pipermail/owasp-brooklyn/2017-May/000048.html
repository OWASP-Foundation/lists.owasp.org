*Cloud Computing acquisition -- New cloud buying guide underpins IT
modernization bill, cyber EO*

The Cloud Center of Excellence this week will release a draft best
practices guide&#8212;please don&#8217;t use playbook, it&#8217;s so last year&#8212;that will give
agency contracting officers, chief information officers and CFOs a new way
of thinking about buying cloud services&#8230;The guidance tries to bring
together seven years of mistakes, successes and false starts around cloud
computing&#8230; the center of excellence wants comments on the draft document
from government and industry alike&#8230; <A HREF="https://federalnewsradio.com/i">https://federalnewsradio.com/i</A>

*IoT *fuels next-gen law enforcement

Growing federal investments in the internet of things -- including cloud,
analytics and sensor technologies -- will power physical and cybersecurity,
a new study shows.

<A HREF="https://gcn.com/articles/2017/05/11/iot-law-enforcement.aspx">https://gcn.com/articles/2017/05/11/iot-law-enforcement.aspx</A>
?s=gcntech_120517 &#8230; building a border wall or increasing the number of
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can &#8220;engender good will with
voters&#8221; who are focused on border security, he encouraged law enforcement
officials to invest more in cloud-based solutions or risk &#8220;losing the
battle.&#8221;&#8230; In terms of IoT growth, software applications and cloud spending
increased the most between FY 2015 and FY 2016, up by 39.8 percent and 34.5
percent, respectively.  Spending on border security and port-of-entry
devices had the sharpest decline (6.8 percent) during the same time
period&#8230;Cloud storage investments led federal law enforcement agencies'
spending in the cloud space, increasing by 73 percent from FY 2015 to FY
2016.  Infrastructure as a service grew by 38.9 percent over that same
period, followed by cloud migration at 38 percent.  Since more companies
are investing in cloud analytics to make use of the data, Govini expects
platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service investments to be the next
large category of cloud spending&#8230;.





*Trump signs long-awaited cyber order, launching hacking defense review*
<A HREF="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/11/trump-cyber-executive-order-238273">http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/11/trump-cyber-executive-order-238273</A>

&#8230; The directive is Trump&#8217;s first major action on cyber policy and sets the
stage for the administration&#8217;s efforts to secure porous federal networks
that have been repeatedly infiltrated by digital pranksters, cyber thieves
and government-backed hackers from China and Russia&#8230;

Homeland Security Issues Warning on Cyberattack Campaign

The Department of Homeland Security is warning IT services providers,
healthcare organizations and three other business sectors about a
sophisticated cyberattack campaign that involves using stolen
administrative credentials and implanting malware, including PLUGX/SOGU and
RedLeaves, on critical systems&#8230; &quot;Command and control primarily occurs using
RC4 cipher communications over port 443 to domains that change IP
addresses. Many of these domains spoof legitimate sites and content, with a
particular focus on spoofing Windows update sites. Most of the known
domains leverage dynamic DNS services, and this pattern adds to the
complexity of tracking this activity.&quot;&#8230; <A HREF="https://music.amazon.com/home/">https://music.amazon.com/home/</A>
browsePanel/bhh-2

&#8230;DHS in its alert notes: &quot;All organizations that provide IT services as a
commodity for other organizations should evaluate their infrastructure to
determine if related activity has taken place. Active monitoring of network
traffic for the indicators of compromise ... as well as behavior analysis
for similar activity, should be conducted to identify command and control
traffic.&quot;&#8230;

*Title: Containers and Security*

*Abstract: *Customer trust and security is paramount for any organization.
While containerization is great for DevOps due to flexibility, speed,
isolation, transient existence, ease of management and patching, it becomes
a challenging environment when the sensitivity level of the data traversing
the environment increases.  Monitoring systems, applications and network;
performing disk, memory and network forensics in case of an incident; and
vulnerability detection can easily become daunting tasks in such a volatile
environment. In this presentation, I would like to discuss uses of
containers and suggestions on how to secure them in the DevOps cycle.



*Bio: *Cem specializes in cloud computing security, system security
architecture, vulnerability management, incident response, digital
forensics, R&amp;D of security software. Prior to Salesforce he led security
R&amp;D and information security teams in Terremark, Verizon, LinkedIn and
various Fortune 500 companies. He has presented at conferences such as,
RSA, Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST.org), Hack In the
Box, Open Source Memory Forensics Workshop (OMFW) and has written articles
about cloud computing security and incident response for various
publications. While not being paranoid about security, he tries to find new
ways to have fun with his friends and family. Mahalo!

*Announcing Comment Period for NISTIR 8170, DRAFT The Cybersecurity
Framework: Implementation Guidance for Federal Agencies
&lt;<A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-8170/nistir8170-draft.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-8170/nistir8170-draft.pdf</A>&gt;*

Draft NISTIR 8170 provides guidance on how the *Framework for Improving
Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity* (Cybersecurity Framework
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework</A>&gt;) can be used in the U.S. Federal
Government in conjunction with the current and planned suite of NIST
security and privacy risk management publications. The specific guidance
was derived from current Cybersecurity Framework use. To provide federal
agencies with examples of how the Cybersecurity Framework can augment the
current versions of NIST security and privacy risk management publications,
this guidance uses common federal information security vocabulary and
processes.

NIST will engage with agencies to add content based on agency
implementation, refine current guidance and identify additional guidance to
provide the information that is most helpful to agencies. Feedback will
also help to determine which Cybersecurity Framework concepts are
incorporated into future versions of the suite of NIST security and privacy
risk management publications. NIST would like feedback that addresses the
following questions:

   - How can agencies use the Cybersecurity Framework, and what are the
   potential opportunities and challenges?
   - How does the guidance presented in this draft report benefit federal
   agency cybersecurity risk management?
   - How does the draft report help stakeholders to better understand
   federal agency use of the Cybersecurity Framework?
   - How does the draft report inform potential updates to the suite of
   NIST security and privacy risk management publications to promote an
   integrated approach to risk management?
   - Which documents among the suite of NIST security and privacy risk
   management publications should incorporate Cybersecurity Framework
   concepts, and where?
   - How can this report be improved to provide better guidance to federal
   agencies?
