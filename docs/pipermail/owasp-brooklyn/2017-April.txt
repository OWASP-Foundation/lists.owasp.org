*Lecture Synopsis:*

Growth of the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing has magnified the
impact of the security challenge by orders of magnitude. Join Wally Rhines,
CEO of Mentor Graphics, as he examines the growing threats to silicon
security and possible solutions.

As electronic system hackers penetrate deeper?from applications to embedded
software to operating system to silicon?the impact of security threats is
growing exponentially. Viruses and malware in the operating system, or
application layer, are major concerns, but only affect a portion of users.
In contrast, even small malicious modifications or compromised performance
in the underlying silicon can devastate system security for all users.

Since hardware is the root of trust in an electronic product, integrated
circuit designers will be increasingly pressured to solve the silicon
security problems for their customers. This requires a new paradigm in
silicon design creation and verification. The traditional approach is to
design and then verify that the silicon does what it is supposed to do.
Creating secure silicon, however, requires that verification ensure that
the chip does nothing that it is NOT supposed to do.

Dear OWASP Brooklynites,


The NJ Chapter of (ISC)2, friends, and sponsoring NY, NJ and CT metro area
security minded organizations are excited to present leading edge insights,
discussions and the exchange of innovative, future focused ideas and
solutions to address technical and business related social engineering.

Social Engineering Conference SECON 2017 <https://www.se-conference.org/>,
a grassroots social engineering conference, presented by the NJ Chapter of
(ISC)2 will take place May 25, 2017 at New Jersey City University
<http://www.njcu.edu/>.

The conference offers prevention, detection, mitigation, response and
recovery educational programs for emerging issues facing today?s
businesses, governments, educators, and cyber security practitioners.

The best of processes, frameworks, devices, and applications can be
compromised if the people managing and using them are social engineered.
This conference highlights how easily people can be manipulated and how to
avoid becoming a victim.

Highlights include:  CISO Panel Discussion:  Impact of social engineering
on Corporations, CEO fraud/Whaling (non-technical social engineering),
Ransomware, interactive social engineering sessions, IoT, fraud, legal and
compliance, social engineering toolkits and a social engineering video
contest.


(ISC)2 New Jersey Chapter <https://isc2chapternj.org/>

(ISC)2 Chapter New Jersey Chapter is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable
organization.  The chapter?s mission is to disseminate knowledge, exchange
ideas, and encourage community outreach efforts, for advancement of
information security practice and awareness in our society.  To also strive
to provide enjoyable opportunities for professional networking and growth.


Looking forward to seeing you at a meetup soon.


Sincerely,

Bev

open!
To:


Good afternoon,



Cyber Quests are a series of fun but challenging on-line competitions open
to ANY cybersecurity enthusiast allowing participants to demonstrate their
knowledge in a variety of information security realms.  The competition is
designed to improve cyber security skills, provide training and mentorship
from world-class instructors, and highlight skills for potential
employers.  The quests have varying levels of difficulty and complexity,
with some quests geared toward beginners, while others include more
intermediate and ultimately advanced material.  Winners of the Cyber Quests
competition, who are 18 years or older, will be eligible to earn an
invitation to attend and participate in a regional Cyber Camp offered later
this Summer.



Contest participants may find more information and register online at
http://USCC.CyberQuests.org.  This year?s Cyber Quests competition will
close on April 23, so visit the contest website and register today!



Thank you!



~JB

Dear OWASP Brooklyn Members,

The OWASP Summit 2017 is focused on the collaboration between Developers
and Application Security.
Details are available on http://owaspsummit.org/

We have a great line-up of working session - http://owaspsummit.org/
website/working-sessions.html
And a growing list of participants - http://owaspsummit.org/
website/participants.html

But for this event to become a success we need more participants and
sponsors!

As OWASP Member you can:
3) sponsor the summit directly with your chapter or project
4) participate yourself and register here - http://owaspsummit.org/
website/buy-ticket.html

If you care about Application Security and want to collaborate with the key
players in this industry, this is the event to be!

Looking forward to see you at the Summit!

Message-ID: <CAFo9UMn7DyvEo+EbP7bZ0FA+FV6Yt31y4amt96BrBmTBkWhpuA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP Brooklyn Members,

There is a free seminar on Monday 4/24 with Eastern Foundry's Geoff Orazem
that you are welcome to sign up for and attend: https://www.meetup.
com/TechTransfer/events/239176404/

If you?re seeking to fund for your new idea, Eastern Foundry's
<http://www.eastern-foundry.com/> Geoff Orazem will give you the tools to
successfully build applications for $225,000 grants from the National
Science Foundation?s (NSF) SBIR program. Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) grants are given to companies with innovative ideas that have the
potential to be commercial successes, and the best part is that the NSF
doesn?t want equity and they do not have to be paid back. However, the
application process can be difficult to navigate, especially for
first-time applicants.
Join us for these valuable insights to ensure that your application makes
the cut.

Geoff will also be a panelist on the Technology Transfer Days (TTD) 2017
Innovation Panel on Monday April 24, 6pm to 9pm at the Brooklyn Navy Yard:
https://www.meetup.com/TechTransfer/events/236321083/
Best wishes,
Bev
