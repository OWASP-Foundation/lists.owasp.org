*ICMCP?s Tech Summit Sponsored by Symantec to Feature Silicon Valley?s
Brightest Minds to Help Decode Cybersecurity Diversity Challenge*

<https://icmcp.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=947870889fffe1385c6ee2dc6&id=ea04d53052&e=83408aff58>
today
announced that Symantec Corporation, the world?s leading cyber security
company, will sponsor the second annual ICMCP West Coast Summit
<https://icmcp.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=947870889fffe1385c6ee2dc6&id=eb7a2c3367&e=83408aff58>
on
minority underrepresentation in cybersecurity. The summit will be held on
November 2nd at the Symantec headquarters in Mountain View, CA from 12-6pm
PST.

The West Coast Summit will bring together technology and security leaders
in Silicon Valley. The summit extends the success of the second annual
ICMCP National Conference held in Washington, DC in March and the earlier
DC Town Hall meeting hosted by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson. It will
provide another opportunity to raise the dialogue on the necessary
strategic, tactical and operational imperatives needed to attract and
develop minority cybersecurity practitioners.

During the one-day summit, security thought leaders will hold a series of
expert panel and audience-driven discussions, and examine ways to further
the inclusion of underrepresented minorities in cybersecurity. Thought
leaders will participate in ?working sessions? that will be documented and
serve as a guide for ongoing efforts and future initiatives to continue the
conversation.

Cybersecurity has been identified as one of today?s most serious economic
and national security challenges. There is a glaring underrepresentation of
women and other historically marginalized minority groups, specifically
African Americans and Hispanics, in the fast-growing discipline. Despite
the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals, it remains an area
where there is a significant shortage of skilled practitioners. The ICMCP
scholarship awards, including voucher certification programs, were
established to promote the inclusion of underrepresented and untapped
minorities in the next generation of cybersecurity practitioners.
