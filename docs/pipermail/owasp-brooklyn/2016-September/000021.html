Eligible is happy to announce their first annual security event. This event
will feature a panel of leaders in healthcare security. They will discuss
security challenges related to software engineering in a regulated industry

a world that has often suffered from stagnation in the name of compliance.

This panel aims to give practical advice and share its collective knowledge
in order to help grow the New York healthcare community.
