2) Technical Detail, Demos & Hands-On

3) Focused on

- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Building Software

- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Breaking Software

- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Defenders

*HOW WE PICK TALKS*

The speaker selection committee is comprised of association volunteers in
various areas of the information security community. The Review Board
advises the chapter on its strategic direction, reviewing, and programming
conference content and providing unparalleled insight into the attendees.

The talks will be reviewed using a basic point system, each reviewer will
be responsible for scoring the talk submission and picking the best
candidates for limited spots.

   - 1-3 Points ? Creative and catchy title
   - 1-3 Points ? Clear and detailed learning abstract/objectives/sources.
   This will be used by the speaker selection committee and viewed by the
   attendee as to why to attend this talk, the more complete the better.
   - 1-3 Points - Outcomes of the presentation meeting the goals of the
   chapter (Visibility for Software Security)

* Speakers will be picked on these criteria regardless of sponsorship if
applicable.

*READY to get started?*
