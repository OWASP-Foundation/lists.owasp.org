candidate submissions. If you are interested in helping lead a global
community that strives on making the world a safer place, then please
consider running for a seat on the Board. Submit your candidacy here
<https://www.tfaforms.com/423356>.  **In mid-August all of the individuals
who submitted a candidaicy will be interviewed, and asked a series
of questions about why they fell they should be elected. The questions they
are asked come from you!  *

*We will take the top 5-6 questions and those will be the questions used
during the candidate interviews. Now is the time to SUBMIT YOUR QUESTIONS!
<https://app2.sli.do/event/06bwaxha/ask>  You may submit your
own question(s) and/or give a "thumbs up" to any
existing question previously submitted by your fellow community members. "?*
