Good morning! Just exploring the OWASP website again and found the
following pages to be interesting and worth sharing:

Citations:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Citations

National & International Legislation, Standards, Guidelines, Committees and
Industry Codes of Practice:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Citations#National_.26_International_Legislation.2C_Standards.2C_Guidelines.2C_Committees_and_Industry_Codes_of_Practice

Enjoy your weekend!

Best wishes,
Bev

This event will be at Alpha One Labs, and we're still looking for a "food

next door. Special highlights will be presentations by new and developing
OWASP Brooklyn projects!

Please help us get the word out, everyone is invited, meetings are free and
open, thanks so much. Hope to see you there!
