*2017 ROCHESTER SECURITY SUMMIT -  CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS*

It is with pleasure that we open the RSS:2017 Call for Presentations. We
humbly invite you to submit your proposal and be considered as we select
this year&#8217;s speakers.

RSS:2017 will be Thursday and Friday, October 19 &amp; 20, 2017. This
conference is organized by the Rochester OWASP and ISSA Chapter and will be
held at the Hyatt Regency in Downtown Rochester, NY. Since 2006, the
Rochester Security Summit has been bringing together a wide range of
professionals and executives to discuss key issues in information security.

This year&#8217;s theme is &#8220;Building Cyber Deterrence.&#8221; We look forward to
receiving your proposal submissions by July 22. We appreciate your time and
consideration. Please review the following speaker guidelines below before
submitting a proposal:

   - Presentations are to be 50 minutes in length (including, within that
   period, time for questions).
   - Please note, we wish to showcase presentations with dynamic content
   and broad appeal; not sales pitches.
   - While vendor participation is a valuable part of our conference, we do
   not allow commercial or marketing content within our presentations.
   - Proposals for training sessions are also welcomed. Training may be
   scheduled as either a half day or full day event.

Proposals may be submitted online by visiting <A HREF="https://www.rochestersecurity.">https://www.rochestersecurity.</A>
org/speaking/ and clicking on the &#8216;Submit a Presentation Proposal&#8217; button.

Timeline:

   - Please submit proposals before July 22
   - We will respond to proposals by August 12
   - Final Abstracts and Bios are due by September 2
   - Draft copy of presentation slides are due by September 16

If you have any questions, please contact me for more information.

Thank you,
