<PRE>Dear OWASP Brooklynites,

security minded organizations are excited to present leading edge insights,
discussions and the exchange of innovative, future focused ideas and
solutions to address technical and business related social engineering.

Social Engineering Conference SECON 2017 &lt;<A HREF="https://www.se-conference.org/">https://www.se-conference.org/</A>&gt;,
a grassroots social engineering conference, presented by the NJ Chapter of
(ISC)2 will take place May 25, 2017 at New Jersey City University

The conference offers prevention, detection, mitigation, response and
recovery educational programs for emerging issues facing today&#8217;s
businesses, governments, educators, and cyber security practitioners.

The best of processes, frameworks, devices, and applications can be
compromised if the people managing and using them are social engineered.
This conference highlights how easily people can be manipulated and how to
avoid becoming a victim.

Highlights include:  CISO Panel Discussion:  Impact of social engineering
on Corporations, CEO fraud/Whaling (non-technical social engineering),
Ransomware, interactive social engineering sessions, IoT, fraud, legal and
compliance, social engineering toolkits and a social engineering video
contest.
