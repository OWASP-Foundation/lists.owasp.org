<PRE>OWASP Community

May 3, 2016

Dear Friends,

It is with great sorrow that I must write to report the sad news of the
death of our Executive Director, Paul Ritchie, after a short illness.

Paul first joined OWASP in August of 2014 and became the full time
Executive Director in May 2015.  He has helped the organization to grow
globally and has made an enormous difference in our community.  He will be
greatly missed.  He brought order and professionalism.  He raised our own
high expectations and delivered on the things he set out to do.  He made
all of us that worked closely with him better and more effective.  He
helped to set long term strategic goals and managed OWASP&#8217;s fiduciary
responsibilities with ease.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we will miss Paul for his leadership
and friendly wry knowing smile as the board worked to make difficult
choices.  I doubt I can express my own sinking feeling of grief at the
news, which came suddenly and too early.

Paul&#8217;s family asked that we direct those in the community that would like
to show support or make a donation to do so in Paul Ritchie&#8217;s name to the
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation at <A HREF="https://www.themmrf.org.">https://www.themmrf.org.</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.themmrf.org/donate-to-mmrf/">https://www.themmrf.org/donate-to-mmrf/</A>&gt;



Sincerely,

Matt Konda

On behalf of the OWASP Global Board
