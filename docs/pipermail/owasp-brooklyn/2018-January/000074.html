*NYU TANDON HACKS CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION*

The Tandon School of Engineering, in partnership with New York City Cyber
Command (NYC3), launched the Cyber Fellows
&lt;<A HREF="http://act.online.engineering.nyu.edu/acton/ct/9709/s-5515-1801/Bct/q-6af3/l-sf-lead-000c:108d/ct2_1/1?sid=TV2%3AvmzTofZzs">http://act.online.engineering.nyu.edu/acton/ct/9709/s-5515-1801/Bct/q-6af3/l-sf-lead-000c:108d/ct2_1/1?sid=TV2%3AvmzTofZzs</A>&gt;,
a unique, affordable online cybersecurity master&#8217;s degree program designed
in conjunction with elite New York City employers to address the acute
shortage of highly trained technical professionals in the city and nation.

It offers scholarships of as much as *75 percent* of tuition to U.S.
residents, bringing the total tuition for the rigorous, highly technical
education to *$15,000 for the entire program* &#8212; the lowest of any
cybersecurity master&#8217;s degree program in New York City.

One of the program&#8217;s most compelling benefits: A free five-year
subscription to audit the newest versions of the online courses that
graduates took as Cyber Fellows &#8212; important because coursework typically
updates every semester, as new threats emerge.

*&#8220;We want our Cyber Fellows to know we will be with them for the long term
&#8211; and I have no doubt that their experiences in the field will enrich
future scholars,&#8221; - Professor Nasir Memon.*

*Open to all US residents nationwide. *
