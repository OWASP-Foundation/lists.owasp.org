Subject: [Owasp-siouxfalls] Reminder: CTF Tomorrow Night at the Sioux Falls
	University Center!
Message-ID: <CAGvHJk6QhSt61BZ=ckP78t0_y2-u-_p0kRewCyOj=Ynw3mSXBQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Just a reminder that we will be having our chapter's first-ever Capture the
Flag event tomorrow night at the Sioux Falls University Center. The CTF
will focus on the purposefully vulnerable OWASP JuiceShop Web application,
which is built entirely on JavaScript. For this CTF, you will need a
wireless capable laptop and a browser, at minimum. If you have experience
using intercept proxy tools such as Burp or ZAP, those will also be very
beneficial. If you don't have experience with these tools, tomorrow is a
chance to learn!

We will be kicking off at 6 PM and running until 8:00 PM, and Pizza will be
provided. If you plan to attend, please RSVP at https://www.meetup.com/
OWASP-Sioux-Falls/events/254161525/. Our meetings are open to all, but an
RSVP helps us plan accordingly.

Also, please check out this blog post at
http://blog.sodaksec.com/2018/08/setting-up-juiceshop-in-heroku.html
<http://blog.sodaksec.com>, which details how to build out your JuiceShop
instance in Heroku. Each person will use their own JuiceShop site, and
Heroku is an easy way to stand one up for free. We only have a couple of
hours in the room, so please try to do this ahead of time. If you get stuck
and aren't sure how, don't fret - we will be able to assist you at the
event tomorrow.
