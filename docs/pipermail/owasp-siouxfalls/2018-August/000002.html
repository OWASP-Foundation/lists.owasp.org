<PRE>Greetings all,

We have rescheduled our Capture the Flag (CTF) event for September 10,
2018, at the SD University Center from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM in room 261 of
the Classroom Building (FADM). This CTF will focus on the
purposely-vulnerable Juice Shop application, which is written entirely in
JavaScript and uses Node.js, Express, and AngularJS. This will be an
individual or team event, but teams can be no larger than three people.

This event is intended to be a fun and educational way for people to learn
some core web application penetration testing skills through hands-on
practice. It's also a great way to see all of the OWASP Top 10 Critical Web
Application Security risks, all in one location. Come on out, have some
pizza and have some fun with other information security and application
development professionals in the Sioux Falls area.

Check out our MeetUp page at
<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Sioux-Falls/events/254161525/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Sioux-Falls/events/254161525/</A> for more details
or to RSVP. Anyone is welcome to attend OWASP meetings and RSVP is not
required, but it does help us plan accordingly. Thanks, and we hope to see
you there!

Paul Kern
