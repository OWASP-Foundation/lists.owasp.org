Subject: [Owasp-siouxfalls] OWASP Chapter Meeting - December 13, 2018
Message-ID: <CAGvHJk6-LYDK75aEqJKBLWWTj9E3ydVEBQOGs2cNgmTi+Qhqmw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

We will be having our next OWASP chapter meeting on Thursday, December 13
at HIgh Point Networks. We have an exciting meeting planned. Nicholas
Penning from the South Dakota Bureau of Information and Telecommunications
will be talking to use about the open source malware analysis tool Cuckoo
Sandbox. We will also be spending a little time looking at the interception
proxy tools Burp and OWASP ZAP, and we will spend a little time working
hands on with them. Lastly, we will have a brief discussion about the
future of our chapter, with an emphasis on input from you. Pizza will be
served at 12:30, and the meeting kicks off at 1:00. Hope to see you there!

*Agenda:*


*12:30 Pizza and Announcements - sponsored by SDN Communications*
*1:00 Cuckoo Sandbox*
Nicholas Penning, a security analyst with the State of South Dakota's
Bureau of Information and Telecommunications (BIT), will be discussing the
open source automated malware analysis tool Cuckoo Sandbox. This tool can
be used in a number of ways to protect organizations from malware outbreaks
that use malicious files as a method of infection. Files uploaded through
web applications are one attack vector, and Cuckoo Sandbox can be used to
mitigate this risk.

*2:00 Burp, ZAP, and Other Funny Sounds*
We will also spend some time looking at two popular intercept proxy tools,
Burp and OWASP ZAP. We will discuss how these tools can be used by security
practitioners to test web applications, and we will take a little time to
download Burp and perform a few tests against a purposefully vulnerable
website hosted in the cloud. Bring a laptop that will allow you to run a
Java application (I know, I know...).

*3:00 What's Next for OWASP Sioux Falls*
We will have a short discussion about the future of the Sioux Falls
chapter, including what things you would like to see from us going forward.
We are also looking for volunteers to serve on a steering committee for our
group, which will be discussed.
