Hello Texas OWASPers!

After a long and difficult RFP selection process, the LASCON planning 
committee has come to an agreement on the presentations for the first-ever 
Lonestar Application Security Conference.  The conference will be held at 
the Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX on Friday, October 29, 2010. 
Registrations are $50 for OWASP members and $100 for Non-Members which 
includes a year of OWASP membership.  We have extended the registration 
discount deadline for one additional week to give you all a chance to look 
over the speaker list, but after 9/24 the price goes up by $50 assuming 
they are still available.  We are well over halfway to our targeted 
registration number and are closing in fast on selling out.  Register 
today at:

  Topic: Technology and Business Risk Management: How Application Security  
  Fits In                                                                   
                                                                            
                                                                            
  This presentation demonstrates how important application security is to   
  the overall stability and security of the infrastructure and the          
  ultimately, the business. Presented from the Information Security         
  Officer/Risk Manager point of view, it shows how a strong information     
  security program reduces levels of reputational, operational, legal, and  
  strategic risk by limiting vulnerabilities, increasing stability, and     
  maintaining customer confidence and trust. It focuses on the top concerns 
  of risk managers and how application security fits into the overall risk  
  management process. The audience will be given recommendations on how to  
  improve cost effectiveness and efficiency to achieve business, security,  
  audit, and compliance objectives relative to applications.

 OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <OFC0E9DF4A.442E09F1-ON862577A5.007667D1-862577A5.0076731C@ni.com>

When: September 28, 2010, 11:30am - 1:00pm


Topic: Technology and Business Risk Management: How Application Security
Fits In


This presentation demonstrates how important application security is to the
overall stability and security of the infrastructure and the ultimately,
the business. Presented from the Information Security Officer/Risk Manager
point of view, it shows how a strong information security program reduces
levels of reputational, operational, legal, and strategic risk by limiting
vulnerabilities, increasing stability, and maintaining customer confidence
and trust. It focuses on the top concerns of risk managers and how
application security fits into the overall risk management process. The
audience will be given recommendations on how to improve cost effectiveness
and efficiency to achieve business, security, audit, and compliance
objectives relative to applications.


Who: Peter Perfetti (Impact Security LLC)


Mr. Perfetti has been working in information security for fifteen years. He
has been involved in IT Security for the financial services industry for
ten years where he has worked as an Information Security Officer as well as
having been responsible for vulnerability and threat management, and
security engineering. Mr. Perfetti worked for Viacom and MTV as the Manager
of Systems Administration and was the Director of IT Risk Management for
the National Basketball Association. He has a broad range of experience in
both operations and security. Mr. Perfetti provided governance and guidance
over risk and compliance issues for the Americas region of ABN AMRO as the
Local Information Security Officer for New York. His responsibilities were

Well over 100 people have registered so far for the Lonestar Application 
Security Conference (LASCON) happening in Austin on October 29, 2010, but 
are you one of them?  We are well on our way to our goal of selling this 
thing out and if you're stalling, you might just miss your opportunity to 
see 20 of the country's top security minds for as low as 30$!  If you 
haven't registered at this point, what are you waiting for?  After today, 
the early-bird discount ends and prices go up.  But you're thrifty, right? 
 You know a good deal when  you see one.  Certainly you want to be "in the 
know" on Monday when everyone around the water cooler is talking about how 
Samy met your girlfriend, don't you?  And don't forget that you still need 
to get more CPEs before the end of the year.  Your security peers from all 
around the state are attending LASCON and you should too!

Registration is easy.  Just go to http://guest.cvent.com/d/vdqf7g/4W and 
enter your name and e-mail address.  Tell us whether you're an OWASP 
member or not (we do validate against the OWASP membership list).  If not, 
you pay an extra $50 which is just the cost of a full year of OWASP 
membership.  Enter your credit card number.  Done.  Now we'll see you at 
the Norris Conference Center in just over a month!

Hey Josh,

Great pitch to get people signed up!  I'm not registered yet but maybe
today ... plus the debates sound awesome!  I did Lincoln-Douglas debate
in high school, and that sounds like a really cool, fun idea.  I've got
to get registered!!  PS--for the debates, don't forget
"cross-examination"--that is the best part!

Later,
Matt S.
