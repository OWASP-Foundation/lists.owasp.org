------------------------------------------------------------


OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, June 28th from 11:30 AM to
1:00 PM


*Game of Hacks: Play, Hack &amp; Track*


Playing around with some ideas we found ourselves creating a hacker magnet.
Game of Hacks, built using the node.js framework, displays a range of
vulnerable code snippets challenging the player to locate the
vulnerability. A multiplayer option makes the challenge even more
attractive and the leaderboard spices up things when players compete for a
seat on the iron throne. Within 24 hours we had 35K players test their
hacking skills...we weren't surprised when users started breaking the
rules. Join us to:

   - Play GoH against the audience in real time and get your claim for fame
   - Understand how vulnerabilities were planted within Game of Hacks
   - See real attack techniques (some caught us off guard) and how we
   handled them
   - Learn how to avoid vulnerabilities in your code and how to go about
   designing a secure application
   - Hear what to watch out for on the ultra-popular node.js framework.

*Speaker: *Igor Matlin


Igor has over 19 years of technical experience in high-tech companies as a
software engineer and technical lead. Prior to joining Checkmarx as our
Senior Solutions Architect, Igor worked as a Technical Manager at Myriad, a
leading mobile software company, and as a Software Engineer and Product
Manager at Novarra, acquired by Nokia in 2010. Igor is an appreciated
speaker at forums such as ISC2, BSides, and OWASP.



Igor studied at Belarusian State University of Informatics and
Radioelectronics and received his B.Sc in Computer Science and Math from
Christian Brothers University.
