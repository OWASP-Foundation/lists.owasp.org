<PRE>Hello Everyone!


Sorry this is getting out a little later than I intended.

183 and Burnet.


Our sponsor will be Ixia.

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Ixia


*When:*  Thursday, June 9th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm


*Where: *Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd).  We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.


*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.


*Sponsor:* Ixia


*At Ixia, we deliver a powerful combination of innovative solutions and
trusted insight to support your network and security products, from concept
to operation. Whether you are preparing your product for launch, deploying
an application, or managing a product in operation, we offer an extensive
array of solutions in testing, visibility, and security&#8212;all in one place.*


*Whether you are seeking greater visibility into your network or better
performance, our solutions validate network functions, test the integrity
of security infrastructure, and deliver an end-to-end view of your network.
The result: stronger applications, better performance, increased security
resilience, happier customers, and maximum ROI.*


*Please RSVP* at <A HREF="http://aus-sec-happy-hour-2016-06.eventbrite.com">http://aus-sec-happy-hour-2016-06.eventbrite.com</A>

If any questions about the chapter, our events, or other topics, feel free
to email me directly, off list.


Looking forward to seeing everyone!
