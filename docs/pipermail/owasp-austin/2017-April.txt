Management from the University of Maryland University College, and M.S. in

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Rapid7


*When:*  *Wednesday, May 3rd*, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm *


** Note that for May it will be on a different day and one week earlier
than normal, to coincide with BSides Austin.*


*Where: *Sherlock?s Baker St. Pub & Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd).  We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.


*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the *OWASP Austin Chapter* and *Capital of Texas ISSA
Chapter* and sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second
Thursday of the month from January to September (but occasionally we make
schedule adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social
gathering of local information security professionals. If you're involved
with InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good
food and conversation.
