<PRE>Hello everyone!



The *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *for May will be on *Thursday,
May 10th*.  We will be at Baby A's on Stonelake Blvd in North Austin.


We want to thank *DirectDefense *for being our sponsor this month.


Here are the details:


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for May*

*When:* Thursday, May 10th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where: *Baby A's, 9505-B Stonelake Blvd, Austin, Texas 78759 (corner of
Stonelake and York Blvd, between Hwy 183 and Mopac).  We will meet in the
area inside the restaurant, in the far left corner.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

*Sponsor:* DirectDefense

committed to offering managed security strategies that are unmatched in the
industry. Whether we are performing assessments of networks, platforms and

don&#8217;t just work&#8211;they work for you.*


Please *RSVP* so that we can get a headcount of how many attendees to
expect:
