Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu_twaFcciHZ+gqCtZ=4hTgFHEnr9sp9xDq5MQM4s8gujg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I hope your holidays have been wonderful and enjoyable.


Our first OWASP Austin Chapter monthly meeting for this year will be on
*Tuesday*, January 29, 2019.  We are continuing the tradition of having a
CryptoParty.


Please register on Eventbrite
<https://owasp-austin-2019-january.eventbrite.com> so that we can be sure
to order enough food for everyone.


*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for January*

When: Tuesday, January 29th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Title: *OWASP Austin CryptoParty!*


*In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'
where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without
privelege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or
station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may
express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being
coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet of today is an amazing
place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr.
Barlow's original vision.*


*In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to
to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy
and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.
CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these
solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to
privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR,
full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend,
public, and not commercially aligned.*


*The Austin Chapter of the OWASP Foundation invites you to join us for our
CryptoParty where you will learn the tools and techniques to keep you safe
from prying eyes.*


*Speakers:*

   - Introduction (Josh Sokol)
   - Phone as Security: the trifecta of Signal, Password Manager, and MFA
   (Dan Ehrlich)
   - Hardware Security Keys (Ryan Breed)
   - You are the captain of your Data (Shirish Patil)


*Food: *Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have
enough for all!

*RSVP:  *https://owasp-austin-2019-january.eventbrite.com

For those who cannot attend, we will set up a broadcast of the meeting.
Note that the OWASP Foundation is switching from using
GoToMeeting/GoToWebinar to Zoom. We will post an update on which one we
will use this month, once we get more information.
