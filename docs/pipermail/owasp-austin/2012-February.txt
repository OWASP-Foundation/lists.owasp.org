Subject: [Owasp-austin] Honeynet Project Meeting in Austin (2/25)
Message-ID: <96E8CB78-9B87-4869-ABBC-970711B35050@gmail.com>

I just wanted to give anyone a heads up that's interested, 
the local Honeynet Chapter (RoT-1) is holding a public meeting on February 25.

I've been a member of The Honeynet project since 2002 through various chapters, 
and I founded the RoT-1 Chapter when I moved back to Austin last year with a few other "alumni" members.

This is the first meeting we're opening up to the public, and I'm encouraging anyone to come that's interested in working on a project or contributing in any way.
I know there are a lot of other people tinkering with honeypot technology in the area and I'd like to get a more active and collaborative local honynet community going.

The meeting will be pretty informal, but one of the big topics will be coming up with project ideas for GSOC2012
I'm helping to put together the GSOC2012 program, so if you have a project idea that could be completed by a student in 2-3 months (and is related to honeynets), we could try to get it funded through GSOC, and you'd basically have a free developer (paid for by google) for your pet project.  
Last year I designed and worked with a student who implemented an android RE tool (http://code.google.com/p/apkinspector) This work was completed by a grad student in China for the honeynet project's Google Summer of Code in 2011, and was one of the best open source collaborative projects I've worked on to date.  

If you're interested in coming out, register at http://r0t1.eventbrite.com/
If you don't want to do that, just email me directly, but the location is still TBD, and I'd like to get an idea of how many people are coming so I can plan accordingly and send out details.

Thanks,
-Ryan

your life as mobile as your phone? No problem, a laptop + Internet =

problem, start an an instance for each one. By the end of this talk,
you'll know all you need to fire up an cloud instance with all of your
favorite tools and start having fun.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Adversity: Good for software,
 good for the soul - HackFormers March 16th meeting
In-Reply-To: <CB6A9CE1.8FFB%mano.paul@securisksolutions.com>
Message-ID: <CB6A9FAD.9031%mano.paul@securisksolutions.com>

Austin OWASP members:

This is to inform you and invite you to the March HackFormers educational
meeting on March 16th, 2012. HackFormers is a faith based Christian
organization of information security professionals, with the mission to
Teach Security, Teach Christ; Teach Security in Christ.

Details of the meeting are given below :
Speaker: James Wickett
InfoSec Professional and Cloud Operations Team Lead at National Instruments.
Date: March 16th, 2012
Venue: Microsoft Technology Center at Quarry Oaks 2.
Address: 10900 Stonelake Blvd. Suite 225. Austin, TX 78759
<http://maps.google.com/maps?client=&rls=en&q=10900+Stonelake+Blvd+Suite+225
++Austin,+TX+78759>

Topic: Adversity: Good for software, good for the soul
Abstract:
Adversity is a fact of software security?bad things happen both
intentionally and accidentally.  In the #infosec field there is a growing
undercurrent of belief that we need to build code that is Rugged meaning
code that is survivable, long-lasting and persistent in the face of
adversity.  When paired with DevOps the Rugged Software movement really
begins to hit a nerve.  The pairing, aptly called Rugged DevOps is where
security becomes an asset to the organization and no longer a drag on
innovation.
The parallels to our daily lives are numerous.  Pages and pages have been
written on the topic and commonly the question of ?why bad things happen to
good people?? or some variation thereof comes up.  This question is a
question of our humanness and how we build our worldview around it is of
utmost importance.
This talk will discuss adversity in software and in the soul and how in the
end it works for the good.
Speaker Bio:
James graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2004 with a BBA in MIS,
where he also ran a Web startup company.  After graduating he joined the IT
division of National Instruments, where he worked on systems and operations
for the company?s large-scale web site (ni.com), for several years.  Then he
moved on to lead the Web division of a rapidly growing local startup,
Community Impact. In 2010, he moved back to National Instruments to the R&D
division, where he leads the security and operations team for the company?s
cloud-based SaaS products.
Over the last five years, James has been involved as a chapter leader of the
Austin OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) chapter and served as
President from 2007 to 2010.  He is the creator and founder of the Lonestar
Application Security Conference (LASCON) which is the largest annual
security conference in Austin.
He is a security expert, bearing CISSP, GWAPT, GCFW, GSEC and CCSK
certifications.
James lives in Austin, Texas with his wife Laura and daughter Lydia.
