<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

Here are some announcements!

*LASCON CFP Closing This Week! *


The Lonestar Application Security Conference CFP is closing Wednesday,
July 31st! If you've been waiting until the last minute to submit your
talk, now is the time!

<A HREF="http://lascon.org/schedule/cfp/">http://lascon.org/schedule/cfp/</A>



*July OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting -- Matt Tesauro, Rackspace*

*When*: Tuesday, July 30th, from 11:30am-1:30pm

*Where*: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C


*Title*: Testing at Cloud Speed:  Security Gone Agile


*Abstract*:
 
As the world of system and application deployment continues to change,
the sys admin and security community are changing with it. With agile
development, continuous deployment, the pace of change in IT has only
increased. After adding in Dev/Ops and cloud, the traditional sys admin
and security processes just don't work. How can you rapidly deliver
servers and applications while making sure they are built reliably and
securely. When you are deploying multiple times a day, there is no time
to fit in your week long security assessment.

A new concept of Test Driven Security, which is loosely based on the
tenants of Test Driven Development,  is beginning to emerge in the
application security community.  This talk will cover how Matt is
putting the practices in place  currently at Rackspace and how you can
architect your security work to be agile enough to keep up with the pace
of change today.  Even if you are not there today, you will be soon
enough.  Its time to embrace the change and say &quot;Challenge Accepted&quot;.
*

**2013 Lonestar Application Security Conference October 24th and 25th! *


Our fourth LASCON conference is bigger and better than ever! Two days of
top-notch training plus two days of the best talks available including
featured speakers &lt;<A HREF="http://lascon.org/featured-speakers/">http://lascon.org/featured-speakers/</A>&gt;such as Robert
&quot;Rsnake&quot; Hansen from WhiteHat, Nick Galbreath, Richard Bejtlich from
Mandiant, Jason Chan from Netflix, Zane Lackey from Etsy.  We are
offering a reduced cost to the first 100 registrations and they are
filling up fast!

Call for Papers &lt;<A HREF="http://lascon.org/schedule/cfp/">http://lascon.org/schedule/cfp/</A>&gt;is open through July,

&lt;<A HREF="http://lascon.org/sponsorship/">http://lascon.org/sponsorship/</A>&gt; available!

Gene Kim, founder and former CTO of Tripwire and a long time member of
the security community and a multiple award-winning entrepreneur said
the following of LASCON:

&quot;Congratulations on putting together *the best security conference I've
ever attended! *  By attracting Dev, Ops, as well as infosec Builder and
Breakers, there was something to be learned by everyone.&quot;


Wendy Nather, Enterprise Security Research Director of 451 Research also
said the following of LASCON:

///&quot;LASCON brings together people who are serious about application
security, creates a space for collaboration, and then wraps it all up in
local Austin flavor. Where else can you learn about mobile app hacking,
automated virtual patching, and rugged DevOps--and then ride the
mechanical bull? The //*great community and sense of purpose*//are the
key ingredients.&quot;/

Don't miss this amazing OWASP event!
