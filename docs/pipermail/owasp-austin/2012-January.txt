Hi All,

The Austin OWASP Study Group is starting up again. This time we will be
going through the Web Application Hacker's Handbook by Dafydd Stuttard and
Marcus Pinto. Note that this is the SECOND EDITION!

I was, unfortunately, not able to get free hard or soft copies for the study
 group. You can buy it on Amazon at
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026470 for around $31. For our first
meeting it will not be necessary to have a copy, but it will be our text
for this session of Study Group, so get one if you plan to attend. If the
price tag will stop you from attending, talk to me and we'll see what we
can work out.

Our first meeting will be next Wednesday, 1/11, at the same time and place
as before. Specific directions and details are below.

Thanks,
Ben Broussard, CISSP

Directions and Times
 - When: Wednesdays from noon to 1pm.
 - Where: We have a room in Building A of the National Instruments
campus (the monthly OWASP meetings are in Building C). The drive has
directions to the buildings clearly marked. Once in Building A take the
elevator to the 2nd floor, go down the hallway to your left past the
restrooms and turn left down the small hallway directly after the
restrooms. Conference room 217 will be the second door on the right. You
will have internet access and we'll have a projector for examples. Feel
free to call me at (512) 944-2210 for details or directions.

Message-ID: <CAMxwwcdRr16OZzFgnwNgiLxrVG2+Xf-ZR6wrFuRWw+vs17hX2w@mail.gmail.com>

Austin OWASPers,



There will be a Half-Day Threat Modeling Seminar on February 9th, from
1:00pm to 4:30pm. The event is co-hosted by ISSA and OWASP Austin.


*
**Topic:** "**Threat Modeling**"*

How will attackers break your web application? How much security testing is
enough? Do I have to worry about insiders? Threat modeling, applied with a
risk management approach can answer both of these questions if done
correctly. This talk will present advanced threat modeling step-wise
through examples and exercises using the Java EE platform and focusing on
authentication, authorization, and session management.

Participants will learn, through interactive exercise on real software
architectures, how to use diagramming techniques to explicitly document
threats their applications face, identify how assets worth protecting
manifest themselves within the system, and enumerate the attack vectors
these threats take advantage of. Participants will then engage in secure
design activities, learning how to use the threat model to specify
compensating controls for specified attack vectors. Finally, we'll discuss
how the model can drive security testing and validate an application
resists specified attack.

*
*


*The Presenter: John Steven*

John Steven is the Senior Director, Advanced Technology Consulting at
Cigital with over a decade of hands-on experience in software security.
John's expertise runs the gamut of software security from threat modeling
and architectural risk analysis, through static analysis (with an emphasis
on automation), to security testing. As a consultant, John has provided
strategic direction as a trusted advisor to many multi-national
corporations. John's keen interest in automation keeps Cigital technology
at the cutting edge. He has served as co-editor of the Building Security In
department of IEEE Security & Privacy magazine, speaks with regularity at
conferences and trade shows, and is the leader of the Northern Virginia
OWASP chapter. John holds a B.S. in Computer Engineering and an M.S. in
Computer Science both from Case Western Reserve University.

Message-ID: <CAP-bJG_dV8aWPzidTb44q+7BLRJen+sN0D2NiFkeEEKbV7U5OA@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy,

For those who have not purchased the book yet (Web Application Hacker's
Handbook, 2nd edition) you can buy a digital copy of it through a
promotional deal on Amazon for $8.14. For those that already have the book,
I suggest you poke around what other books qualify for this discount
because I found a variety of stuff on my "to read" pile.

You can find the details here:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=pe_159950_22250310_pe_button/?docId=1000763191&ie=UTF8#gc

The link to the book is here:
http://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-ebook/dp/B005LVQA9S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1326917967&sr=1-1


The key points are these:

   - You apply the code ("ETXTBOOK") to your account by entering it into
   the link described in step 1.
   - When you checkout the code will automatically be applied to your bill.
   - The *deal ends on January 23, 2012*
   - You have to download their Kindle reading software to initially
   download it, however several programs exist that strip Amazons drm encoding
   and converts it to various other formats


Lastly, make sure to read all the details, because I don't want to
misinform anyone.


Kevin

P.S. What information can you deduce about Amazon's technology based on the
link? =)

Live Streaming Broadcast We will be streaming the meeting live using
GoToMeeting. If you are unable to attend, you may still hear the meeting
during the scheduled time at https://www3.gotomeeting.com/join/817893494
The streaming is a bit on the experimental side, so no guarantees this will
all work perfectly. We're still working out the kinks, but we are excited
to offer this as a method to join us in our meetings. You will get to enjoy
the slide deck and the audio using the method, but will miss out on the
networking and the food, so come on out if you are able. If you do use the
GoToMeeting method, we'd love to hear feedback about your experience.
