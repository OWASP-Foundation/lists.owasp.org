<PRE>Hello Everyone!


The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for March will be *on
Thursday, March 9, 2017*.  We will be at our usual location at Sherlock&#8217;s
Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill at 183 and Burnet.


Our sponsor will be *Rapid7*.


&#8212;&#8212;


Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Rapid7


*When:*  Thursday, March 9th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm


*Where: *Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd).  We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.


*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the *OWASP Austin Chapter* and *Capital of Texas ISSA
Chapter* and sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second
Thursday of the month from January to September (but occasionally we make
schedule adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social
gathering of local information security professionals. If you're involved
with InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good
food and conversation.


*Sponsor:* Rapid7


*Rapid7 is engineering better security with simple, innovative solutions
for IT security's most critical challenges. Our security data and analytics

you need to dramatically reduce threat exposure and detect compromise in
real-time. They speed investigations so you can halt threats and clean up
systems fast. Plus, our analytics give you the specific information you

of your assets and users from the endpoint to the cloud. We offer unmatched
capabilities to spot intruders leveraging today's #1 attack vector,
compromised credentials. Our ability to help goes beyond our innovative
technology. Rapid7 security experts can help you advance your security
program, whether you need emergency breach response or to transform your
security processes and better align investments to your organization's risk
and needs. Rapid7 is trusted by more than 4,150 organizations across 90
