<PRE>*When:* April 28, 2009, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Topic: * Architecting Secure Web Systems

For this month's presentation, we diverge from the typical OWASP topics of
writing secure code, testing to make sure your code is secure, and other
code related topics and delve into the process of actually architecting a
secure web application from the ground up. We'll start with some basic
n-tier architecture (web vs app vs DB), throw in some firewall and DMZ
concepts, then talk about server hardening with client firewalls (iptables),
disabling services, and other techniques. Whether you're a code monkey
wondering how the rest of the world works, a security guy trying to figure
out what you're missing, or an auditor just trying to understand how the
pieces fit together, this presentation is for you.
