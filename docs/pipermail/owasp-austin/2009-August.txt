Subject: [Owasp-austin] Travis's security mailing list
Message-ID: <20090803214520.GA1017@subspacefield.org>

Hi folks,

This is Travis.  I did the Web 2.0 crypto talk last month.

I just wanted to announce that while I do not have a blog, I do have a mailing list:

http://lists.bitrot.info/mailman/listinfo/tsec

It's an informal list, and I mostly send out links that I find interesting.
Mostly right now it's friends or people who know me through AHA or OWASP.
It's not all original; often times it's just a paper or web site that I
found particularly interesting.  You're welcome to join, and once you do,
you can read through the old posts if you want, making it kind of like a blog.

I am evaluating blog options, but they all seem to be plagued by security
problems.  As a security expert, I'd find having my blog hacked to be
very embarassing.  I just can't bring myself to run software in which I don't
have confidence.  I considered having it hosted somewhere else, but as a privacy
advocate, I don't like the idea of a company owning my data, especially when
can be security-sensitive...

Subject: [Owasp-austin] what makes a good security expert, paper, blog post?
Message-ID: <20090805014032.GB9853@subspacefield.org>

So I recently read this excellent paper:
http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html
There's a number of other essays on his site about programmers and programming
languages that also apply; I'll leave you to find those on your own.
He is a wonderfully refreshing writer.

I'm thinking of writing up a short talk on the following subjects.
I don't consider myself famous in any way, but I am a big consumer
of security information and have strong feelings about the following
questions.  And I want to hear other opinions, especially if you
can provide an explanation of why...

My questions to you are:

1) What makes a good security expert?
   Educational background
   Personality characteristics
   Fields of study/expertise

2) What makes a good security presentation, paper, blog post?
   Breadth/narrowness/generality/specificity of topic
   Intended audience
   Evolution vs revolution
   Offensive vs. Defensive technology
   Spin/pitch/approach/title
   Style
   Length

Subject: [Owasp-austin] OT? web application frameworks
Message-ID: <20090812044140.GA1007@subspacefield.org>

So I'm starting up a personal project and I'm trying to decide from
among the gazillion web application frameworks, which I should
investigate.

The goal is to rapidly produce a web site, because my spare time
is rather limited.  So no C++ or java frameworks really fit my bill.

So far I've heard a lot about Ruby on Rails, obviously (who hasn't?).
Unfortunately I'm a novice at Ruby; I like it a lot, but I'm to the
point where I can write ruby programs, but not at an expert level.
I watched a screencast of someone developing a web site with RoR, and it's
apparent that a knowledge of normal Ruby is not enough; he dizzied me
with what he was doing, I couldn't keep up.  In fact, just reading
the Wikipedia article left me dizzy with the thousands of ways to
do things.

I also have a friend who has done some RoR work, and he actually
prefers Pylons.  This is good news for me, because I've developed
some non-trivial programs in python, and am quite familiar with it.

However, I want to make sure I'm not just choosing the easiest path,
but the right tool for the job, if it's significantly better.

What should I look for in such a web framework?  That is, how should
I decide between the large number of them out there?

Hi Travis,
I've used CakePHP before.  It is similar to RoR.  I've never used RoR but
CakePHP and it from my understanding use the MVC framework to be more
productive faster.  To give you and example of when I used CakePHP.  At work
I had to take a vast training web site that was entirely static and make it
into a dynamic site.  I taught myself CakePHP in two weeks, built the site
in two more weeks, and had two weeks of testing.  Granted this was a full
time job, but should give you some idea of what it takes.

I would say that frameworks like CakePHP, RoR, etc are good if there are
very specific functionality that you want to create.  However, if you are
just going for a run of the mill web site with a possible blog, calendar,
etc.  I would suggest taking a look at Drupal, Wordpress, and Squarespace.
 Drupal is probably the most flexible out of the three.  However, with that
flexibility comes a fairly complex learning curve.  Wordpress would be next.
 Not too much of a learning curve if you only want to stick to blogging and
regular pages that don't really do much. Squarespace is definitely the
easiest but you can't really do much of anything custom and if you are on a
budget it might not serve your needs.

Anyway, I hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any questions! :)

Jay

If you want to code in Python then django is a good framework -
http://www.djangoproject.com/

In terms of "how to decide" - that's a real corker.  It depends on your
requirements, and then on either using every framework to demo it, which is
probably infeasible from a time standpoint, or getting an accurate read on
what exactly each one does, which can be hard to suss out from the general
technical fanboy blather about any given one.  It's kinda like asking
"which car is best."  There's a highly subjective element and an "what do
you need" element to it.

In this case, I'd probably start out with choosing a language you are
conversant with (from the mainstream java/php/perl/python to weird stuff;
there are smalltalk and erlang web frameworks out there for the insanoids).
If you choose Python, then knowing one or two frameworks (django and
pylons) just start googling them "vs" each other and you can get people's
head to head thoughts and likely will find other well respected ones since
you'll get hits to "django vs pylons vs thing3."  Like I found turbogears
in short order doing that.  Seems like in general those are the big 3
(assuming you don't count plone) in the Python world.  From reading the
comparisons it seems like there's some pretty good distinctions depending
on how much of a noob you are in that area and how much customization you
want.  django is more cookie cutter and mature, turbogears is more noob
friendly, and pylons is more customizable.

You may want to check out WEB2PY from DePaul University in Chicago.  It was
developed to train incoming freshman to develop their first web app for a
nonprofit after two weeks of classes on a Saturday afternoon (four hours).
 Took the best of Zope and RoR and made an environment for mortals to
program.  They were trying to push it into the enterprise space since it has
an easy to use development environment for fairly sophisticated schemas.
http://www.web2py.com/

If your schema is moderately complex or will grow into a complex schema, you
may want to consider WEB2PY.  RoR is going through a mid life crisis as they
are trying to merge MERB and RoR and create a Plugin environment complicated
by the fact that the Ruby community and the RoR community don't interact
enough in my humble opinion.  If you know Python and you might deploy on
Google, WEB2PY might be a worth a look.  Final comment on RoR.  It is
ideally a RESTful CRUD framework for end users but it is still a programmer
paradigm (command line instead of 100% browser like WEB2PY).

Sorry, E.  I replied to only you at first.


I'm a big fan of Django.  I recently reviewed Google App Engine as a
possible framework for a tool I was building.  The App Engine definitely
made things easy and has a lot in common with Django.  The catch is that you
must be comfortable with the access restrictions Google can provide for your
data.  If it's a come-one-come-all site you are building, the App
Enginecould save you a lot of time.

I agree with Ernest.  You need to consider your requirements and organizations skill sets then consider the various frameworks (and maybe you already have).  With that said, here are a few lines of thinking you may want to consider on your project if it's helpful.

I have developed commercial software professionally for many years on both Java and C++.  When I develop server applications, I like Java because it supports mainstream hardware and operating system platform choices for many consumers.  Commercially, there are no clear server platform winners and Java provides a lower cost alternative to coding solutions for each platform -- clearly a business advantage.

Even if you're not writing software commercially, platform independence is useful during upgrades and server refreshes.  Beyond platform independence, Java has rich open source support community and source code availability is helpful during troubleshooting.  If you're a Microsoft/.NET shop (.NET has lots of great features) that's fine.  My point is not to persuade you to change frameworks but only to consider my viewpoint for building services.

The following are some choices I have considered and my thinking behind them.

- JRuby.  JRuby is a Java implementation of Ruby that also provides options for Java extensibility.  For example, if you have some performance intensive tasks you can call Java programs directly from JRuby.  My general concern with Ruby is that it is an implementation NOT a specification; therefore, there is no governing body that guides changes to Ruby except its creators.  Of course, they probably listen to their user community, but practically speaking, a Ruby program on one interpreter is not guaranteed to work on another whereas Java\C++ work under a variety of virtual machines and compilers, respectively.

- WebObjects.  I always had a soft spot for WebObjects.  WebObjects is a Java based framework developed by Jobs at Next and brought to Apple when he returned.  WebObjects was far ahead of its time.  Many of the framework tools today are knock offs of WebObjects.  WebObjects is unique because it brings WYSIWYG to web development.  I'm not sure what Apple is up to these days with WebObjects but if I were undertaking a project I might review it for viability as a solution (assuming IT would entertain the thought).  Some of the more interesting WebObjects features at the time were: fast service deployment without scripts, Entity Modeler tool which is an ORM layer like Hibernate, support for many DBs, MVC architecture, easy to scale just add more servers, extensible, and more.  The biggest drawback at the time is you must use their development environment for WYSIWYG programming (no Eclipse, darn).  I have seen some substantial deployments on Solaris at a portal company.  Generally, only limited sections of a web site are managed by WebObjects like the "Shopping Cart" or dynamic areas, not static pages.  WebObjects can be combined with Drupal or Joomla to create a full featured web site solution.

- Component approach.  If requirements are loose sometimes it's safer to error with flexible components.  JBOSS/Tomcat for MVC layer.  Hibernate for managing persistence business objects.  Log4j, Syslog, and Splunk for comprehensive logging and log viewing.  The appeal of component based architecture is that you have maximum flexibility (but at the expense of increased development time).  The extra time you invest up front may save time after the software evolves.  There is less chance of hitting performance or functionality limitations within someone else's framework.  You can fudge (or falling short) a little on implementation and fix it later but fudging on architecture leads to real problems later.  Business always wants solutions faster than they can be delivered but I suggest working to help these folks understand what can reasonably be accomplished.

Oh yea, keep in mind you should code review any open source you use.  Assuming that it must be secure, reliable, or even scalable because it's used widely is a bad assumption.  I have found many flaws in mainstream open source (e.g., SQL Injection, concurrency issues, etc) and I have come to the conclusion they (like commercial communities) are focused on functionality. While it's a good survival skill to be sure, it's a bit disconcerting if your quality standards are higher module you plan to include <grin>.

Good luck,

Subject: Re: [Owasp-austin] OT? web application frameworks

If you want to code in Python then django is a good framework -
http://www.djangoproject.com/

In terms of "how to decide" - that's a real corker.  It depends on your
requirements, and then on either using every framework to demo it, which is
probably infeasible from a time standpoint, or getting an accurate read on
what exactly each one does, which can be hard to suss out from the general
technical fanboy blather about any given one.  It's kinda like asking
"which car is best."  There's a highly subjective element and an "what do
you need" element to it.

In this case, I'd probably start out with choosing a language you are
conversant with (from the mainstream java/php/perl/python to weird stuff;
there are smalltalk and erlang web frameworks out there for the insanoids).
If you choose Python, then knowing one or two frameworks (django and
pylons) just start googling them "vs" each other and you can get people's
head to head thoughts and likely will find other well respected ones since
you'll get hits to "django vs pylons vs thing3."  Like I found turbogears
in short order doing that.  Seems like in general those are the big 3
(assuming you don't count plone) in the Python world.  From reading the
comparisons it seems like there's some pretty good distinctions depending
on how much of a noob you are in that area and how much customization you
want.  django is more cookie cutter and mature, turbogears is more noob
friendly, and pylons is more customizable.

So I'm starting up a personal project and I'm trying to decide from
among the gazillion web application frameworks, which I should
investigate.

The goal is to rapidly produce a web site, because my spare time
is rather limited.  So no C++ or java frameworks really fit my bill.

So far I've heard a lot about Ruby on Rails, obviously (who hasn't?).
Unfortunately I'm a novice at Ruby; I like it a lot, but I'm to the
point where I can write ruby programs, but not at an expert level.
I watched a screencast of someone developing a web site with RoR, and it's
apparent that a knowledge of normal Ruby is not enough; he dizzied me
with what he was doing, I couldn't keep up.  In fact, just reading
the Wikipedia article left me dizzy with the thousands of ways to
do things.

I also have a friend who has done some RoR work, and he actually
prefers Pylons.  This is good news for me, because I've developed
some non-trivial programs in python, and am quite familiar with it.

However, I want to make sure I'm not just choosing the easiest path,
but the right tool for the job, if it's significantly better.

What should I look for in such a web framework?  That is, how should
I decide between the large number of them out there?

Just a status update.

I decided to just get started.  I knew python and wasn't feeling like
I could come up to speed with advanced Ruby & RoR as quickly.  So I
located this book:

http://pylonsbook.com/

Starting from scratch, I had your basic "Hello World" in under 30
minutes.  I found it to be so much fun that I had to force myself to
go to sleep at 2am.

Developing in this framework was so easy that if I find something
better, re-writing my initial design will be even easier.

For those who are interested in Ruby, there's a conference coming up
near the end of the month:

http://lonestarrubyconf.com/

For those who deal with PHP, I wanted to send a friendly warning:

There's a system cracker group or person called ZFO...  which has hit
and cruelly humiliated a number of whitehats recently.

Based on my read of their latest screed, it appears to me that they're
using PHP LFI vulnerabilities to get initial access to the system.
That doesn't surprise me; the quality of PHP applications is very low,
and it appears to be hard - or at least uncommon - to write PHP
applications that don't have major security flaws.

Just a side note here, but I am going to the Ruby conference and so is
Rich.  Since I am new to Ruby, I am taking the remedial training class
before the conference.

It should be a great conference.

On the topic of interesting conferences coming up, there's one for Mono
(the open source .NET) Oct 30 in Austin called Monospace.  We are getting
into more .NET and looking at Mono and Moonlight as our cross-platform
delivery vector so we're sending folks.

  That doesn't surprise me; the quality of PHP applications is very low,
  and it appears to be hard - or at least uncommon - to write PHP
  applications that don't have major security flaws.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] First public CSSLP certification class will be held
	next week in Austin
Message-ID: <f25fbcdc0908131321y2c666a16uf47fa1f38f7e5683@mail.gmail.com>

Mano Paul, a fellow OWASPer here in Austin asked me to forward this on to
the group.  He would be more than happy to answer any questions you might
have about the training and the pricing discount.  Feel free to spread this
around to friends and coworkers.

--------------

Friend, Austinites, Texans and everyone else



If you are in IT or software development, you are sure to have come across
the aspect of security as it pertains to software development and the
chances are that you have heard of the latest Certified Secure Software
Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) certification from (ISC)2.

This is to inform you that the very first public CSSLP certification class
will be held next week in Austin (8/17-8/21).

Working with (ISC)2  I have been instrumental in developing this
certification and was the 2nd person in the world to achieve this which has
benefitted me substantially in the software security arena. I believe
strongly that holders of this certification will have a similar benefit as
well.

I will be the instructor for this class and since this is the official
launch of the educational seminars from (ISC)2, one-time promotional and
aggressive discounts on this 5 day class is available that you can take
advantage of now.



If you are interested in the certification, please contact me for details of
about the certification, discounts available and for registration.

If you are already certified or if you know someone who might be interested
in the certification, may I kindly request you to forward this information
to them (or their security heads within their organization).



Additionally if you are interested in private corporate classes for your
organizations, you can contact me as well.



Kindly spread the word around and do not hesitate to contact me if you have
any additional questions.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] PHP LFI exploitation
Message-ID: <20090819205925.GG1215@subspacefield.org>

Told James about this at the last meeting and figured others might be
interested too.

In the aftermath of the AT&T debacle, where they pushed out a PHP script
that had a local file inclusion vulnerability, there was some discussion
on reddit.

One of the posters mentioned two ways to exploit a LFI to execute
arbitrary PHP code on the server.

Basically, you tell the PHP script to include one of two files:

1) /proc/self/environ.  This has the environment variables passed to
the process, which in the case of CGIs (and maybe PHP), contains
some user-specified data like the User-Agent field.  By embedding
PHP code in the User-Agent or other client-controlled fields, you
get local code execution.

2) The log file for the server itself.  Most www server log files
contain user-specified fields like Referer and User-Agent.  Embed
PHP in those fields, then tell the app to include it, and again
you have local code execution.

I once saw a really sneaky but simple back door written in PHP.
Apparently the adversary had managed to get his own PHP uploaded to
the server, and it accepted a shell command to execute as a POST
parameter.  The clever thing about this was that there were virtually
no logs of what happened; it didn't show the parameters in the log
file because they were POST parameters, and there was no shell history
because the PHP code's call to system() invoked a non-interactive
shell.

Message-ID: <20090825185401.GG12076@subspacefield.org>

For those who are interested in Bell-La Padula and other security models, I did a brief
search and cataloged the ones that I found in a section in my book:

http://www.subspacefield.org/security/security_concepts/index.html#tth_sEc3

I'm also trying to locate all the relevant databases of things like CVE, CWE, etc.
Right now I've dumped them into a section of my book that really needs some
reorganization, but they're here:

http://www.subspacefield.org/security/security_concepts/index.html#tth_sEc33

One person mentioned something that sounded like KPAC, and from what I gathered,
was some kind of database of attack patterns...  does anyone have more information
on this?

Hi,

Was the tool shown today the "SDL Threat Modeling Tool"?  It only works with Visio 2007 and we are stuck on 2003 at work. I poked around Microsoft's website but couldn't find an older version.  Is their one that works with Visio 2003?

Thanks,
Alana :)

They were probably referring to CAPEC

CVE, CWE and CAPEC are good stuff from Mitre.  

Speaking of CVE, CWE and CAPEC, you might want to glance at:
