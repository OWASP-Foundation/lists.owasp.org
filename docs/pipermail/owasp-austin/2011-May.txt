Hey Austin OWASPers!

I mentioned this at our last meeting, but since not everybody was there, I 
wanted to send out a note about it as well.  We have begun planning for 
LASCON 2011 .  This means that we are actively looking for volunteers, 
soliciting sponsors, accepting speakers, and taking registrations for the 
2011 Lonestar Application Security Conference happening at the Norris 
Conference Center on October 28, 2011.  I'll keep this brief, but if you 
are interested in volunteering or sponsoring LASCON, send us an e-mail at 
lascon at owasp.org and we will get you the necessary information.  If you 
are interested in speaking at LASCON, please submit to our CFP at 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011.  This year's 
conference will feature 4-5 tracks focusing on Auditing, Architecture, 
Development, Executive Management, Solutions, and OWASP Tools.  The CFP 
will be open until July 15, 2011.

Most importantly, if you are interested in attending LASCON 2011, 
registration using our brand new RegOnline system is now online.  Simply 
go to http://www.lascon.org and click on the "Register Now" link. 
Registration is only $75 for members and $125 for non-members (includes 
$50 OWASP membership) through the end of July.  While we haven't made the 
speaker lineup public yet, we have already committed presentations from 
some of the world's top security professionals.  And make sure you stick 
around after the conference for our LASCON Happy Hour sponsored by 
Trustwave.  Yes folks, the bar and the mechanical bull will be back.  Just 
like last year, you will not be disappointed.  No conference gives you 
more bang for your buck than LASCON.  We'll see you there!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol and James Wickett
LASCON 2011 Co-Chairs

Message-ID: <4DCDA343.3020107@gmail.com>

Hi all,

At the end of April, we concluded our study group focusing on the OWASP
Testing Guide. We all learned something and there was some good,
technical discussion that came out of it.

We'll be starting up again in June, going through WebGoat. Each week we
will perform, discuss, and analyze the attacks. Check out WebGoat at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project.

If you're interested, send me an email and I'll add you to the list.

Directions and Times
 - When: Every Wednesday starting June 1st from noon to 1pm.
 - Where: We have a room in Building A of the National Instruments
campus (the monthly OWASP meetings are in Building C). The drive has
directions to the buildings clearly marked. Once in Building A take the
elevator to the 2nd floor, go down the hallway to your left past the
restrooms and turn left down the small hallway directly after the
restrooms. Conference room 217 will be the second door on the right. You
will have internet access and we'll have a projector for examples. Feel
free to call me at (512) 944-2210 for details or directions.

Thanks,
Ben Broussard

All,

About two weeks ago I sent an email to Space Rogue at Hacker News
Network, an excellent weekly video podcast. They have a segment where
they cover conference news. I asked him to mention LASCON. He did so
on this week's episode. Even mentioned the mechanical bull! Check it

Hello,

I just wanted to let you know that I goofed when sending out the May OWASP 
meeting notice and used our June presentation info instead of the correct 
information.  This month is a do-over of the highly anticipated LASCON 
presentation "Why Ha.ckers.org Doesn't Get Hacked" by James Flom.  It 
should be pretty awesome.  I'll send a new invite out for the June 
presentation in a couple of weeks.  Thanks!

 Training (6/17/2011 1:30 - 5:00 PM)

Austin OWASPers,

One comment that I've heard from you all time and time again is "This 
Metasploit stuff looks really cool, but I don't know how to get started."  
If that sounds like you, then Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA have 
something special for you.  We have recruited Raphael Mudge, creator of 
the Armitage UI for Metasploit, to come to Austin and give a half-day 
training on "Penetration Testing with Metasploit".  This hands-on training 
will teach you not only how to get started with Metasploit, but the 
methodology behind conducting a penetration test using the tool.
The training will take place on Friday, June 17, 2011 from 1:30 to 5:00 PM 
at the Microsoft Technology Center.  Registration for this event is FREE 
courtesy of OWASP, ISSA, Microsoft, and Raphael, but space is extremely 
limited.  Once the registration has been filled, we will have a limited 
waiting list for potential entry the day of the event.  If you are 
planning on attending, you will want to sign up ASAP.  If you are unsure, 
please do not sign up and take away a spot from someone who will 
definitely attend.  To register yourself for the event, please go to:
http://metasploit.eventbrite.com

Because this training is hands-on, attendees are required to bring a 
laptop with either VMWare Player or VMWare Fusion pre-installed.  The 
laptop must also have a working DVD drive as we will be providing DVD's to 
all attendees containing the supporting software for the training.  In the 
event that registration is full, seating preference will be extended to 
those attendees who come prepared with the required tools. 
Immediately after the half-day seminar, we will head over to Sherlock's 
Baker St. Pub (183 and Burnet) for an Austin Security Professionals Happy 
Hour sponsored by Rapid7.  Note that this a different week and day of the 
week than our typical happy hour events in order to coincide with the 
preceding half-day seminar.  While attendance to the seminar is first-come 
first-served, the happy hour is open to everyone and a separate invitation 
will be created for it.

Sincerely,
