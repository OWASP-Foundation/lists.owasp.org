    Terrifying, Dan Crowley

*When:* Tuesday, March 26th from 11:30a-1:30p

*Topic:*Why UPnP is Awesome and Terrifying

Abstract: UPnP daemons can be found on a wide range of devices these
days, from network devices to desktop OSes to network-attached
electrical outlets and more. While UPnP is mostly known for its use in
automated port forwarding, it serves as a general interface to allow
interaction with a host in a variety of ways determined by the host
providing the UPnP interface. This talk will explain how UPnP discovery
and interaction occurs, and demonstrate issues with various devices
running UPnP daemons.

*Speaker:* Dan Crowley, Trustwave Spiderlabs

Daniel (aka &quot;unicornFurnace&quot;) is a Managing Consultant for Trustwave's
SpiderLabs team. Daniel denies all allegations regarding unicorn
smuggling and questions your character for even suggesting it.Daniel has
developed configurable testbeds such as SQLol and XMLmao for training
and research regarding specific vulnerabilities. Daniel enjoys climbing
large rocks. Daniel has been working in the information security
industry since 2004 and is a frequent speaker at conferences including
