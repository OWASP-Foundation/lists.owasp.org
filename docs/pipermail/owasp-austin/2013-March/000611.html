<PRE> Austin OWASPers,

Below are two events and one job posting. :-)

Please RSVP for these events so we can plan for capacity!


    February Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, Sponsored by Rapid7

*When:* Tuesday, March 19th, 5-7pm (we've had to adjust the date and day
of the week for Austin B-Sides and Spring Break)

*Where:* Sherlock's Baker Street Pub and Grill, 183 and Burnet.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated between the Austin ISSA and OWASP Chapters to provide
security professionals an opportunity to network and have a good time!

*Our Sponsor:* Rapid7

Your organization wants to move fast, but security is complex and you
may often feel like you're slamming on the brakes. If you don't have a
clear view of your environment, your user activity, and the threats you
face, it's hard to move forward with confidence.

That's where Rapid7 comes in. Our simple, innovative software solutions
give you visibility into the risk associated with your IT, your users
and the real threats you face. Our software helps you quickly prioritize
threats, manage risk, and take the right steps to improve your
organization's security. We understand every organization is different
and the best approach for you may not be the best approach for someone
else.

With broad visibility and contextual insight into what's happening in
your information security environment, we give you the ability to adapt
to whatever obstacles rise up in the road before you so your
organization can go as fast as it needs.

Rapid7

    OWASP Austin March Chapter Meeting - Why UPnP is Awesome and
    Terrifying, Dan Crowley

*Please RSVP at the link below so we can plan for food. By doing this,
you will also be signed up for our monthly drawings!*

*When:* Tuesday, March 26th from 11:30a-1:30p

*Where:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Topic:*Why UPnP is Awesome and Terrifying

Abstract: UPnP daemons can be found on a wide range of devices these
days, from network devices to desktop OSes to network-attached
electrical outlets and more. While UPnP is mostly known for its use in
automated port forwarding, it serves as a general interface to allow
interaction with a host in a variety of ways determined by the host
providing the UPnP interface. This talk will explain how UPnP discovery
and interaction occurs, and demonstrate issues with various devices
running UPnP daemons.

*Speaker:* Dan Crowley, Trustwave Spiderlabs

Daniel (aka &quot;unicornFurnace&quot;) is a Managing Consultant for Trustwave's
SpiderLabs team. Daniel denies all allegations regarding unicorn
smuggling and questions your character for even suggesting it.Daniel has
developed configurable testbeds such as SQLol and XMLmao for training
and research regarding specific vulnerabilities. Daniel enjoys climbing
large rocks. Daniel has been working in the information security
industry since 2004 and is a frequent speaker at conferences including
DEFCON, Shmoocon, and SOURCE. Daniel does his own charcuterie.
