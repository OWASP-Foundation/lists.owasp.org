Web Systems Engineer - National Instruments
This is an awesome job with an awesome team at NI, but you've got some 
large shoes to fill....mine.  I'm transitioning into a new position as the 
Information Security Program Owner and they are looking to backfill my 
position.  Let me know if you are interested and I'll put you in touch 
with the right people.


The Web Systems Team at National Instruments is currently seeking an 
experienced Web Systems Engineer to join our growing team in Austin, TX.

As the Web Systems Team, we are responsible for delivering the ni.com 
customer experience.  This means that we own back end of ni.com:  Java 
application servers, content management, web services, search, web 
security, performance, scripting, web 2.0 community software, and all the 
other fun things that Web Systems people do. We design, implement, and 
support these and other cool technologies, working interactively with our 
programmers, designers, marketers, and technology groups to bring NI's 
products to the world.

We're looking for a smart, motivated person with a good understanding of 
how the Web works. This position is for a mid-career, self-starter who's 
interested in taking ownership of one or more areas of ni.com Web 
technology and "making it happen" in a consensus-driven environment.  In 
addition to relevant web technology knowledge, the ideal candidate will 
have good UNIX skills, be able to program/script in a variety of *nix 
languages, and most importantly, a big picture understanding how systems 
work together on the Web.

This is a Web Systems administration position; not Web design, Web 
applications programming, help desk, or operating systems administration. 
Typical activities include, but are by no means limited to:  configuring 
load balancers, root-cause analysis of application server crashes, 
identifying security holes in Web applications, debugging and isolating 
performance issues, responding to automated fault alerts, reviewing Java 
application design, conducting supplier product evaluations for a variety 
of needs, and developing tools to automate your team's work.  Members of 
this team also provide 24x7 support for the site as part of an on-call 
rotation.

Opportunities this position will afford you: 
?       A chance to excel and room to innovate 
?       Hands on experience with a wide variety of Web technologies in an 
enterprise environment 
?       Network with a wide variety of other smart and motivated 
professionals 
?       Troubleshoot exceedingly complex technical issues across all 
levels of the technology stack 
?       Responsibility to improve things that could be better 
 
Minimum Qualifications: 
?       BBA or BS in MIS, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or 
related field 
?       3+ year Web server administration (Apache or other)
?       1+ year J2EE application server experience (OAS, WebLogic, 
WebSphere, or JBoss/Tomcat) 
?       1+ years UNIX systems administration (Red Hat Enterprise Linux or 
Solaris preferred)
?       Intimate knowledge of HTTP/HTTPS protocols, and strong familiarity 
with other Internet protocols 
?       Knowledge of other web concepts such as FTP, firewalls, caching, 
DNS, and proxies
?       Scripting ability in Perl, bash, PHP, Python, and/or a similar 
language 

Additional desirable skills/expertise: 
?       Experience with content management systems (especially Vignette 
v7)
?       Experience with search (especially FAST ESP)
?       Experience with SOA
?       Demonstrated passion for the Web, such as active involvement in 
industry groups

  Topic: Automated vs. Manual Security: You can't filter The Stupid         
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Everyone wants to stretch their security budget, and automated            
  application security tools are an appealing choice for doing so. However, 
  manual security testing isn?t going anywhere until the HAL application    
  scanner comes online. This presentation will use often humorous,          
  real-world examples to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses   
  of automated solutions and manual techniques.                             
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Automated tools have some strengths, namely low incremental cost,         
  detecting simple vulnerabilities, and performing highly repetitive tasks. 
  However, automated solutions are far from perfect. There are entire       
  classes of vulnerabilities that are theoretically impossible for          
  automated software to detect. Examples include complex information        
  leakage, race conditions, logic flaws, design flaws, and multistage       
  process attacks. Beyond that, there are many vulnerabilities that are too 
  complicated or obscure to practically detect with an automated tool.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Confirmed: Automated vs. Manual Security: You can't
 filter The Stupid - OWASP Meeting (Apr 27 11:30 AM CDT in National
 Instruments - Building C - Conference Room 1S13)
Message-ID: <OF44C43C3B.6081A4E0-ON86257711.00705266-86257711.007054E4@ni.com>


When: April 27, 2010, 11:30am - 1:00pm


Topic: Automated vs. Manual Security: You can't filter The Stupid


Everyone wants to stretch their security budget, and automated application
security tools are an appealing choice for doing so. However, manual
security testing isn?t going anywhere until the HAL application scanner
comes online. This presentation will use often humorous, real-world
examples to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of automated
solutions and manual techniques.



Automated tools have some strengths, namely low incremental cost, detecting
simple vulnerabilities, and performing highly repetitive tasks. However,
automated solutions are far from perfect. There are entire classes of
vulnerabilities that are theoretically impossible for automated software to
detect. Examples include complex information leakage, race conditions,
logic flaws, design flaws, and multistage process attacks. Beyond that,
there are many vulnerabilities that are too complicated or obscure to
practically detect with an automated tool.


Who: Charles Henderson (Trustwave)


Charles Henderson has been in the security industry for over 15 years and
manages the Application Security Practice at Trustwave. He has specialized
in application security testing and application security assessment
throughout his career but has also worked in physical security testing and
