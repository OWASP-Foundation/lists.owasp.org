OWASP Austin,

As of right now I have received NO RESPONSES to my e-mail asking for
speakers at the January 29, 2019 OWASP Austin CryptoParty.  I know how much
you all like hearing me speak, but my goal for this event has always been
to give a chance for new speakers and new ideas.  I am looking for others
who are willing to give a 10 minute max presentation on a crypto-oriented
subject.  The presentation will need to be laid out so that novice and
experienced alike can take action based on the data presented.  All tools
must be free and open source.  If you are interested in presenting, please
e-mail me directly (do not reply to the list) with your name, bio, talk
title, and abstract for consideration.  Thank you!

I've had a couple of people respond now with interest in presenting, but
not knowing a topic to present on.  If you're interested, I'd recommend
taking a look at these pages for ideas:
