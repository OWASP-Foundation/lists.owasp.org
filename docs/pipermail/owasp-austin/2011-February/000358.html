<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

Make sure you mark your calendars for Thursday, February 10 as the next 
Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Cisco.  Our January 
event brought out 40-50 people and an awesome time was had by all.  I 
heard some concerns from people about the vendor sponsors of these events 
when I asked why some people weren't making it out.  For those of you 
worried about that, don't.  The vendors are all told in advance that they 
are not getting lists of attendees or anything like that.  Any business 
card exchanges or vendor conversations are typically self-initiated and 
usually have nothing to do with the products which they support.  This 
event is also open to everyone so if you feel more comfortable bringing a 
spouse or significant other, please do so.  If you didn't make it in 
January, hopefully you can come out this month and take advantage of this 
opportunity to have free drinks and food and network in a very informal 
atmosphere.

We had our first meeting on the OWASP Secure Password Project yesterday 
with a great group of people who are excited about working on it.  That 
said, it looks like we could really use some developer talent on the team. 
 If you're a code monkey who has a little bit of spare time for a really 
cool security project, please let me know.  Even if you're not a developer 
and are interested in helping, we still have plenty of work to do.  Just 
shoot me an e-mail to let me know you are interested and I'll add you to 
the mailing list.

Speaking of the OWASP Secure Password Project, one of our contributors, 
Rick Redman, will be presenting on the topic of &quot;Supercharged Password 
Cracking Techniques&quot; at our next meeting.  It's a pretty awesome talk on 
the research he's done on the common passwords that people use and the 
tools that penetration testers use to break them.  Hopefully this will get 
you excited enough about the chapter project to volunteer some of your 
time if you haven't already.

I've had a couple of cool educational opportunities come across my desk 
lately that I'd like to share with you.  The first is an ISSA Birds of a 
Feather session on &quot;Defining a Security Program in Business Terms&quot; 
presented by Brandon Dunlap of Brightfly, Inc.  It is from 6-8:30 PM on 
Thursday, February 24th.  It is free for ISSA members and $10 for 
non-members.  The second opportunity is the free B-Sides Security 
Conference happening March 11 and 12 in downtown Austin.  Both have 
provided PDF documents which I have attached to this e-mail, but in case 
you don't get them or don't trust them, more information is available at:
