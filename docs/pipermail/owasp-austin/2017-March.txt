OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, March 28th from 11:30 AM
to 1:00 PM


*DevSecOps Lessons from Detroit to Deming*


In 1982, the city of Detroit saw 15,000 vehicles roll off its production
lines every day.  To achieve this goal, Detroit's line workers were being
measured on velocity, often at the expense of quality.  At the same time,
auto workers in Japan -- applying lessons from W. Edwards Deming -- were
implementing new supply chain management practices which enabled them to
manufacture higher quality vehicles, for less cost, at higher velocity.  As
a result, from 1962 to 1982, the Detroit auto industry lost 20% of its
domestic market to Japan.


The parallels between the auto industry of 35 years ago and software
development practices in place today are remarkable.  DevOps teams around
the world are consuming billions of open source components and
containerized applications to improve productivity at a massive scale. The
good news: they are accelerating time to market. The bad news: many of the
components and containers they are using are fraught with defects including
critical security vulnerabilities.


This session aims to enlighten Security, DevOps,  and development
professionals by sharing results from the 2017 State of the Software Supply
Chain Report -- a blend of public and proprietary data with expert research
and analysis. The presentation will also reveal findings from the 2017
DevSecOps Community survey where over 2,200 professionals shared their
experiences blending DevOps and security practices together.  Throughout
the discussion, Derek will share lessons that Deming employed decades ago
to help us accelerate adoption of the right DevSecOps culture, practices,
and measures today.


Attendees in this session will learn:


   - What our analysis of 60,000 applications reveals about the quality and
   security of software built with open source components


   - How organizations like PayPal, Intuit, Fannie Mae and the Department
   of Defense are utilizing the DevOps principles of software supply chain
   automation


   - Why avoiding open source components and containers over 3 years old
   might be a really good idea


   - How to balance the need for speed with quality and security -- early
   in the development lifecycle

Attend this discussion and leverage the insights to understand how your
organization's application DevOpsSec practices compare to others. We'll
share the industry benchmarks to take back and discuss with your Security,
DevOps, and Development teams.


*Speaker: *Derek E. Weeks


After flying to 40 countries and racing through a half-Ironman competition,
Derek woke up one morning on the top of Kilimanjaro and saw the world in a
new light. Soon after, Derek become a huge advocate of applying proven
supply chain management principles into AppSec practices to improve
efficiencies and sustain long-lasting competitive advantages. He currently
serves as vice president and DevSecOps advocate at Sonatype, creators of
the Nexus repository manager and the global leader in solutions for
software supply chain automation.  Derek is also the co-founder of the All
Day DevOps conference and the lead researcher behind the annual State of
the Software Supply Chain report.

Hey fellow OWASPers!  Happy Friday!

I know a lot of you don't know me because I haven't been around for a while
now, but wanted to reach out to the list in case anyone is looking for work!

I'm with Charles Schwab here in Austin now working on setting up a
Compliance Testing program.  We're mainly using Qualys to start, but we are
absolutely open to using any tool that fits the job!

I'm looking for a Sr. level security person, someone who is interested in
setting up and running a compliance testing program.  Specifically, I want
to automate as much as possible of the testing!  If you're interested in a
new opportunity, send me an email and I can provide more detail.

Thanks!
