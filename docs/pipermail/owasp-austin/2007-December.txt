Subject: [Owasp-austin] December OWASP Meeting is Tomorrow - Jeremiah
 Grossman at National Instruments
Message-ID: <C379C1F6.421%jwickett@impactnews.com>


When: December 4th, 2007, 11:30am - 1:00pm

Who: Jeremiah Grossman (WhiteHat Security, CTO, OWASP Founder, Security
Blogger)

Topic: Business Logic Flaws

Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are just a
few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that malicious hackers
have abused to compromise major websites. These types of vulnerabilities are
routinely overlooked during QA because the process is intended to test what
a piece of code is supposed to do and not what it can be made to do. The
other problem(s) with business logic flaws is scanners can?t identify them,
IDS can?t detect them, and Web application firewalls can?t defend them.
Plus, the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more
prone it is to have flaws in business logic.


This presentation will provide real-world demonstrations of how pernicious
and dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a website. He?ll
also show how best to spot them and provide organizations with a simple and
rational game plan to prevent them.
