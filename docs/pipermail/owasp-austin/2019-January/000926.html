<PRE>Hello everyone!



For our first *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *of the year, we
are having a special one-off event where we are partnering with *Secure |
Austin* to have them host the happy hour.  It was originally planned for
January, but was postponed until February. For this special event, it will
be at the *77&#186; Rooftop Bar in the Domain*, on *Thursday, February 7th*.


Note that we will plan to have our future happy hours at Baby A's starting
in March.


Here are the details:


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for February*


*When:*  Thursday, February 7th, 6:00 pm - 8:30 pm

*Where:* 77&#186; Rooftop Bar, 11500 E Rock Rose Ave, Austin, TX 78758 (in the
Domain near the Apple Store).

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters. We try
to meet every second Thursday of the month from January to September
(but occasionally
we make schedule adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social
gathering of local information security professionals. If you're involved
with InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out to network with
other like-minded folks.

*Sponsor:* Secure | Austin.
