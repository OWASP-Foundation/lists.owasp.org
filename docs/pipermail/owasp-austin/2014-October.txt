Hello,

Protiviti's Seattle-Portland office is hiring penetration testers. It is a
strong company with good people and good practices. I'm happy to answer any
questions you may have, but don't want to ask the recruiter.

I don't have a job requisition to share, but you can contact Tyler for
details. If you plan to apply, please let me know, and I'll split the $5K
finder's fee with you.

Howdy Austin OWASPers!

We can't believe that the year is already almost over!  Once again, LASCON
was a huge success last week.  The LASCON volunteer crew had a blast
meeting so many new faces from all over.  The training session's were great
and the conference was outstanding.  We are already planning for another
amazing LASCON in 2015, but first we are going to take a little break from
OWASP activities, but we will be back in full force in January!  Stay tuned!

--
Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour -- next on January 8th!

--
OWASP Monthly Meeting -- next on January 27th!

--
Even the OWASP Study Group has been taking a break after finishing the last
book.  Check out the MyOWASP Ning site for their next scheduled meeting --
http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup

--
While OWASP may be taking a break, other local Austin organizations are
blazing ahead during the fall/winter period like --

Austin ISSA - Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (CHFI) Training
December 1-5 @ Norris Conference Center in Austin

Come learn the essential hands-on skills needed to take your security game
to the next level. Whether you?re part of an incident response team or
investigating a computer crime, you need to figure out what they did, what
they changed and what they deleted so you can determine the best path. You
will learn how hackers and malicious users hide data, delete data and
attempt to hide their tracks. You will learn how to uncover what they have
deleted and how to follow the trail they left behind. You will also learn
how to be a first responder at a computer crime scene, how to handle
evidence, duplicate disks, investigate wireless attacks, investigate web
attacks, do mobile forensics and a myriad of other key skills.

Austin ISSA invites you to take the CHFI training the week of December 1-5
at the Norris Conference Center. This course normally costs $3000, but we
are offering it to members for only $1150! The course includes a voucher
for the CHFI certification (worth $500) and access to online labs so you
can practice the hands-on skills you learned. Class enrollment is limited,
so sign up <http://austin-chfi.eventbrite.com/> early because it?s expected
to sell out.

Even more local activities (not just ISSA or OWASP) can be found at the
ISSA Capital of Texas Chapters' Calendar
<http://www.austinissa.org/calendar/>

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Don't Forget to Vote for the OWASP Board!
Message-ID: <CAFwvDexs0JHDz1sn_pHf4MXVnUyo1=aZxntSitu=1CSx-cORcA@mail.gmail.com>

Texas OWASPers!

If you are an official OWASP member, then you are eligible to vote in the
currently running OWASP Board Member election.  Not sure?  Check for your
name here:

https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheets/d/1yVkbYHVeAhcvCNvOFqwRTF6cdi-_nQ0CTVNoLYo0vC8/edit#gid=1153465796

There are two days left for you to cast your vote and even if you don't
know any of the candidates and would prefer to "abstain", we would ask that
you do so on the ballot so that we can make sure that all votes are
accounted for.  If you find your name on that list, then you should have
received an e-mail from owasp at simplyvoting.com providing you with
instructions on how to vote.  If you did not receive that, then most likely
it's either in your SPAM filters or you did what I did and clicked
"unsubscribe" on a past message.  The OWASP staff would love to get that
corrected for you so you can vote.

There are all sorts of resources out there for you to learn about the
different candidates ranging from the OWASP Podcast to these videos:

Candidate video #1
Matt Konda, Bil Corry and Tahir Khan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibze2gzv8Gs

Candidate video #2
Andrew van der Stock, Nigel Phair, Israel Bryski and Abbas Naderi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YgOKhpNYc

Candidate video #3
Jim Manico, and Timur Khrotko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jw2ZrarhT0

I'm not here to support any candidate in particular and I have another year
left on my term, but I wanted to make sure that all of you were informed
about the process and took the opportunity to get involved in selecting
those who will influence the future of our organization.  Please let me
know if you have any questions.

Take care!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
OWASP Foundation Board Member

Yes. I've heard back from two people that you must have a degree, but I
don't know that this is a hard rule of you have deep experience.

Call me today after 12:30 Pacific.
