<PRE>Hello Everyone!

This month's OWASP Austin Chapter meeting will be on Tuesday, April 26,
2016.  Note that only for this month *we will be at a different
location*: *Norris
Conference Center*.  Please be sure to remember this; a reminder will be
sent out the day before the meeting just in case.


*Please RSVP on Eventbrite &lt;<A HREF="http://owasp-austin-2016-april.eventbrite.com">http://owasp-austin-2016-april.eventbrite.com</A>&gt;* so
that the food order can be placed to ensure enough food for everyone.
Also, the room we will have at Norris will only accommodate 80 people, so
it will be really important to RSVP.


Following are the details of the meeting:


------------------------------------------------------------


OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, April 26th from 11:30 AM
to 1:00 PM


*Data-Driven App Sec*


New research into application security practices at over 100 companies will
be presented, covering software security strategies and tactics as they are
practiced in the wild, based on the new BSIMM6 dataset. Statistics will be
balanced with war stories from the field to illustrate foundational
principles of starting and sustaining programs, as well as &#8220;what not to do&#8221;
gotchas that can kill an initiative in its tracks.


*Speaker: *Joel Scambray


Joel Scambray is a Principal at Cigital, a leading software security
consulting firm established in 1992. He has helped Fortune 500-class
organizations address information security challenges for over twenty years
as a consultant, author and speaker, corporate leader, and entrepreneur. He
is widely recognized as co-author of the Hacking Exposed book series, and
has worked/consulted for companies including Microsoft, Foundstone, Amazon,
Costco, Softcard, and Ernst &amp; Young. In recognition of his work with
Hacking Exposed, Joel received the ISSA President&#8217;s Award for Public
Service in 2015.


*RSVP* &#8212; <A HREF="http://owasp-austin-2016-april.eventbrite.com">http://owasp-austin-2016-april.eventbrite.com</A>

to have enough for all!
