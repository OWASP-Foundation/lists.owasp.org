Subject: [Owasp-austin] Open Pen Tester position - permanent & in Austin area
Message-ID: <1254747076.17189.14.camel@mtesauro.tea.state.tx.us>

Not sure if this is 100% OK so feel free to delete this email and flame
me directly if you consider this SPAM, inappropriate, etc.

That said, I know someone who is looking to fill a permanent position
for a Penetration Tester.  The position is in Austin and will be
conducting 'general' pen tests with an emphasis on web application
testing.  

If you're interested, email me directly at mtesauro [at symbol here]
gmail.com and I can give you more details plus put you in touch with the
person who is looking.

I'm not a recruiter nor am I getting any referral bonus for this - I
simply know the guy who is looking and thought there may be interest on
this list.

Cheers!

Just added to this webinar: We'll also be discussing the latest breaking news on WhiteHat Security's first-of-its-kind Integration with Snort IPS. Click here <http://click.mkt2lead.com/?ju=fe3515777364047c771075&ls=fdf910757764067473177476&m=fec6157175630374&l=fe551673706d057b7c13&s=fe2d10747d610479711673&jb=ffcf14&t=>  to read more. 

Most security officers are not software developers, and rarely do they have control over the security associated with internally developed software systems. However, CSO's are still frequently held accountable when externally-facing software is compromised and a breach occurs. Unless security professionals radically upgrade their knowledge of software and software development techniques, they will continue to inadequately manage the risk that custom software systems represents to the enterprise. 

Presented by John Dickson of Denim Group and Jeremiah Grossman of WhiteHat Security, this webinar will help non-development security managers understand the salient aspects of the software development process and to upgrade their IQ on software. It will help them to identify risks with different assessment approaches, how to inject themselves into the development process at key "waypoints," and to understand ways to influence development peers to write more secure code. 

Please register early <http://click.mkt2lead.com/?ju=fe3415777364047c771076&ls=fdf910757764067473177476&m=fec6157175630374&l=fe551673706d057b7c13&s=fe2d10747d610479711673&jb=ffcf14&t=>  to reserve your space.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Austin Meeting - Vulnerability Management In
	An Application Security World - Tuesday, Oct 27, 2009
Message-ID: <f25fbcdc0910211143l43ac5ehed5cd1d58d022551@mail.gmail.com>

*When:* October 27, 2009, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Topic: *Vulnerability Management In An Application Security World

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code
reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk.
Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing
with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically
require the coordination of security teams with application development
teams and require security managers to secure time from developers during
already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes
require changes to custom application code and application-specific business
logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often
sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.

This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while
trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines
strategies security teams can use for communicating with development teams.
Similarities and differences between security teams? practice of
vulnerability management and development teams? practice of defect
management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication
between these groups.

Austin OWASP Members,

Some of you already know this, but I am leaving Austin and heading back to
Atlanta to run Information Security at another company.

The security community in Austin is truly remarkable having world-renowned
security experts and I have been impressed over the past 3 years on the
level of sharing, collaboration, and the overall humility in this security
community. True to the spirit of Austin, our gatherings were laid back, ego
was checked at the door, and we were all better for having each other?s
company.

I am proud to have been part of this community.

Like my Dell Global Information Security teams, I wish you all the best and
know that I will see you again.

Regards,

Phil Agcaoili
