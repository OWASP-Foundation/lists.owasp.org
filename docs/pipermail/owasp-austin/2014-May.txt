The votes are in!  We had a decent number of surveys filled out (22) and we
really appreciate your input.

The results indicate a varied opinion of what should be our next study
group topic.  There were three of the five that garnered higher first-place
votes.  From an Average Ranking perspective, two tied:  *Kali/Backtrack *and
*The Practice of Network Security Monitoring*.  Because of this tie, I was
tempted to resend another survey to ask for voting on only those two, but
decided that would create an extra delay.  So instead, the tie-breaker is
going to the one receiving the most first-place votes (by 1 vote),
which is *The
Practice of Network Security Monitoring*.

As was provided in the survey, the following is the information about the
topic and the book to be used.  The link to the book is for Amazon, but
there are other sources to purchase the book, such as Barnes and Noble, etc.

*The Practice of Network Security Monitoring*

?         Book -
http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Network-Security-Monitoring-Understa...<http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Network-Security-Monitoring-Understanding-ebook/dp/B00E5REN34/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1>

o    Price is approx $33 for paperback, $25 for Kindle Edition, and $23 for
Nook Book (on B&N
site<http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-practice-of-network-security-monitoring-richard-bejtlich/1115199871?ean=9781593275099>
).

?         Relies on Security Onion
(SO)<https://code.google.com/p/security-onion/wiki/IntroductionToSecurityOnion>distribution.

?         Mid-length book (376 pages).

?         Assumes previous knowledge of TCP/IP networking and essentials of
network attack and defense.



Following is a summary of the book?s description:



?Network security is not simply about building impenetrable walls ?
determined attackers *will* eventually overcome traditional defenses. The
most effective computer security strategies integrate network security
monitoring (NSM): the collection and analysis of data to help you detect
and respond to intrusions.



In *The Practice of Network Security Monitoring*, Mandiant CSO Richard
Bejtlich shows you how to use NSM to add a robust layer of protection
around your networks ? no prior experience required. To help you avoid
costly and inflexible solutions, he teaches you how to deploy, build, and
run an NSM operation using open source software and vendor-neutral tools.



You'll learn how to:

?         Determine where to deploy NSM platforms, and size them for the
monitored networks

?         Deploy stand-alone or distributed NSM installations

?         Use command line and graphical packet analysis tools, and NSM
consoles

?         Interpret network evidence from server-side and client-side
intrusions

?         Integrate threat intelligence into NSM software to identify
sophisticated adversaries



There's no foolproof way to keep attackers out of your network. But when
they get in, you'll be prepared. *The Practice of Network Security
Monitoring* will show you how to build a security net to detect, contain,
and control them. Attacks are inevitable, but losing sensitive data
shouldn't be.?



We realize that this topic was not the favorite for some, but hopefully you
may find enough interest to want to participate.  Obviously the topic of
information security is broad and there are lots of aspects to learn and
understand.  I myself, with a role more on the software development side,
am interested in this topic and want to know as much as possible how best
to protect the applications I am responsible for developing and
implementing.

The next steps are to obtain a copy of the book and plan on the date we
will start.   Most likely the first few meetings will be dedicated to
reviewing the layout of the book and any sort of pre-setup needed for the
Security Onion.  I will create a new discussion thread on the OWASP Austin
Study Group forum (http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austinowaspstudygroup/forum
).  If you want to participate and are not already signed up on the Ning
site, please take the time to sign up.  The study group foklrum is how we
communicate announcements about dates, specific chapters we will be
covering, etc.

Please email me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,

Tiana Chandler, OWASP Austin Chapter Training/Study Coordinator

Hi Everyone,
  Several people have asked what went into the giveaways this month in the
bags --

Rasperry Pi Model B w/ SD Card
http://www.alliedelec.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?SKU=70313519
Case:
http://www.alliedelec.com/search/productdetail.aspx?SKU=70274616
Power adapter:
http://www.alliedelec.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?SKU=70232557
USB Cable (used with power adapter)
http://www.alliedelec.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?SKU=70240887
USB Wifi
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?gclid=CNuA8uvD_LwCFUpnOgod50QAUQ&Item=N82E16833315091&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-_-pla-_-Wireless+Adapters-_-N82E16833315091&ef_id=k1tPlWhW4SYAAIZo:20140305231836:s

Alternate identical items are easily purchased from other vendors,
no endorsement of a vendor is implied here.  (but both were very fast and
easy on purchase and delivery.)

Remember from Branden's talk that while there are many SD cards, some are
not usable with a Raspberry Pi, so make sure to check out --
http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards

And that the power adapter and USB cable for powering the Pi are typically
identical to a phone charger/micro USB, so that part is easily
purchased/procured elsewhere.  See the Raspberry Pi FAQ for more
information about power requirements --
http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#powerReqs

Happy making!

sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

OWASP Monthly meeting on May 27th
11:30 - 1 (really 11:45 - 1, we gotta eat sometime)

Title: How to Use Crowd-Sourced Threat Intelligence

Abstract: This talk will include an overview and demo of the Open Threat
Exchange (OTX) and describe some of its information sources, including
anonymous sharing from Open Source Security Information Management (OSSIM.)
Jaime will share some of his experiences using OTX as a security
researcher. He will also provide his thoughts on how OWASP members can
benefit from security research and threat intelligence to "build in"
security rather than constantly reacting.

Speaker: Jaime Blasco is a Security Researcher with broad experience in
network security and malware analysis. At AlienVault, Jaime manages the Lab
and runs the Vulnerability Research Team in charge of researching and
integrating threat intelligence into detection mechanisms.

Food: Taco Deli time! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough for all!
Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

   meetings.  At minimum we will plan out for the next few weeks.
   - For the rest of the meeting, *Josh Sokol has graciously offered to
   lead the group through a threat modeling exercise*.  Thank you Josh!

Information for the study group is on the myowasp.ning.com website:

   - The *OWASP Austin Study Group* main group page is
   http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austinowaspstudygroup
   - The discussion forum for the current study group is titled "*Study
   Group - The Practice of Network Security Monitoring - CURRENT*" and link
   is
   http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/topics/study-group-the-practice-of-network-security-monitoring-current

To keep up with the current status of the study group, as well as receive
any notification of changes to scheduled meeting dates, I would encourage
you to create a Ning account, *join* the *OWASP Austin Study Group* group,
then *follow* the discussion forum.
