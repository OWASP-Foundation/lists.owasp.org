Message-ID: <AANLkTim7SqSwRkDu4qqjDaqoK4BWwgBzGnGtNNh=C7Em@mail.gmail.com>

One thing about hackathons or code-a-thons is security often gets
overlooked, so if anyone wants to join us...

Just a reminder that the Austin News Hackathon is a week from tomorrow,
October 16. Please sign up if you haven't already:
http://meetupaustin.hackshackers.com/calendar/14963391/

Here's the complete rundown:

   prepared by Pick Up Stix)
   - EFF-Austin <http://effaustin.org/>
   - GNI Strategies <http://www.gnistrategies.com/>
   - Hacks/Hackers <http://hackshackers.com/>, funded by Knight
Foundation<http://www.knightfoundation.org/>
   - Plutopia Productions <http://plutopiaproductions.com/>
   - Texas Observer <http://www.texasobserver.org/>

   - Saturday, October 16, 9am-4:30pm

 Where is it?

   - Austin Community College?s terrific Eastview Campus
   - 3401 Webberville Road, Building 8000

 Who should come?

   - Journalists, bloggers, and other strong writers and communicators who
   understand the power of technology, but don?t know where to start in taking
   raw data and transforming it into newsworthy information.
   - Technology developers looking for an opportunity to build meaningful,
   worldchanging solutions. We also need designers and technical writers to
   help design and document the applications we build.
   - Government employees and officials who want to spread the word about
   the data they've already released, and learn what is necessary to provide
   the most useful data to the public.

 What is it?

The Hackathon is a collaboration of newsy people who understand
communication and nerdy people who understand application development.
Collaborative teams will conceive and define data-driven news applications,
and build real, workable open source solutions that transform raw data into
headline news.
 What will we do?

   - The plan is to identify publicly-available, readily accessible data
   sets ? see http://www.texastransparency.org/opendata/
   - Journalists and bloggers will brainstorm with technology developers,
   creating ideas for applications using the available data, and building those
   applications.
   - This partnership of people who develop news and people who develop
   technology will produce workable applications that will be placed online for
   the anyone to see and use.
   - At the end of the day, judges will select the best applications. ?
   Bring your computer, we?ll have great wifi. What will you take away?
   - Communicators will have a better appreciation and understanding of
   technology and the process of application development.
   - Developers will learn much more about the news ecosystem, and how to
   find meaning and value in increasingly available data sets.
   - Everybody will learn how to build stories and deliver news in a world
   of pervasive digital convergence. The ultimate deliverable is a
   better-informed society

Hello Austin OWASPers!

Time sure does fly by doesn't it?  I can hardly believe that it's been 
almost a year since I took over as President of the chapter.  This past 
year we've had nine amazing presentations and nine outstanding Happy Hour 
events, but our year is quickly coming to a close.  Historically November 
and December meetings have had relatively low attendance so we've decided 
that instead of trying to force meetings during the holidays we'll have 
one big end-of-year blowout in October.  That blowout is known as the 
Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON).

On October 29, 2010 our OWASP chapter will be holding the first-ever OWASP 
Regional Conference in Texas at the Norris Conference Center here in 
Austin.  We have arranged for three tracks (Technical, Management, and 
OWASP Etc) consisting of some of the best presentations and presenters 
that the world has to offer.  It's a full day of talks (and CPE credits) 
for so cheap your boss won't be able to say anything but "yes" to.  It 
even includes meals, bags (not your usual cheap conference bags either), 
and a kick-ass Happy Hour at the end.  We are at about 70% capacity right 
now with three weeks left until the conference.  Registrations have been 
coming in daily and we do expect it to fill up very soon.  Get your 
conference pass today!

Conference Schedule: http://www.lascon.org
Registration Link: http://guest.cvent.com/d/vdqf7g/4W

We would like to thank our Gold Sponsors Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, 
Splunk, and Impact Security LLC for their generous support of LASCON and 
enabling us to make it as cheap as possible for all of our attendees.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)

The Wall Street Journal, whose owners have a problem with free information,
covers the web scraping industry, painting it as a security attack or "break
in."  Ignoring the whole time how many journalists depend on it....

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Innotech Booth for OWASP
Message-ID: <4CB6629E.6080609@mtesauro.homelinux.org>

I ran into Brian Engle at the ISACA talk I gave on Tuesday and he talked
to me about the upcoming Innotech Conference which is happening on
October 28th.

ISSA and OWASP did a joint booth last year and he was wondering if we
could get anyone out to man the booth with him from OWASP.

I can ask for some swag and such from the OWASP mothership but won't be
able to do the booth that day.

Is there anyone who'd be willing to hang out for all or part of the day
on Thursday?

Austin OWASPers,

By now I'm sure you've read all of my e-mails about how awesome LASCON 
will be and I'm slowly starting to wear you down.  In fact, our current 
LASCON attendance numbers represent about 56% of the total number of 
people on this mailing list.  That's good, but it's not great and it 
starts to beg the question "What are you waiting for?"  If you've been on 
the fence about whether or not to get your pass to LASCON, I've got three 
pieces of information that will hopefully persuade you to come.

We've decided on the format for the first-ever LASCON Speed Debates and I 
can tell you that this is unlike anything you've ever seen before at a 
conference or elsewhere.  Two teams of three well-known security 
professionals pitted against eachother to argue their case on some of the 
most relevant issues security professionals face today.  Ahead of time, 
they will only be provided with a set of topics of which three will be 
selected for debate.  They will not know whether they are arguing 
affirmative or negative until the debates begin.  I can't tell you how 
excited I am for this event!
>From the beginning, we have been planning our last Happy Hour event of the 
year immediately following LASCON.  We have now officially confirmed that 
the Norris Conference Center will play host to this event.  Even better, 
the bar will open up just before the LASCON Speed Debates mentioned above 
and will go until 7 PM.  Stop by the Denim Group, WhiteHat Security, or 
Radware booths in the Expo Hall in order to get free drink tickets for the 
LASCON bar.
Prices for LASCON registration will go up on Tuesday, October 26, 2010 to 
their final resting place of $200 per conference pass.  This means no more 
student or OWASP member discounts and an additional $50 over the current 
non-Member rate of $150.  It does, however, still include a year 
membership to OWASP ($50 value).  We're getting close to selling out, but 
if passes are still available the day of the conference, $200 is the price 
you can expect to pay at the registration table.  For all you hold outs 
out there, get your LASCON pass today!

Conference Website: http://www.lascon.org
Direct Registration Link: http://guest.cvent.com/d/vdqf7g/4W

See you at LASCON one week from Friday on October 29, 2010!  As always a 
special thanks to our generous LASCON Gold Sponsors Gemalto, WhiteHat 
Security, Splunk, and Impact Security LLC!

Austin OWASPers,

As you all know by now, tomorrow (10/29/2010), our OWASP chapter will be 
hosting the first-ever OWASP Regional Conference in Texas.  The full 
schedule, presentation abstracts, and speaker bios are now up on the 
conference website for you to check out.  I wanted to let you guys know 
that we have a small handful (a couple dozen) of LASCON passes still 
available before we sell out.  The rate is now $200 for all conference 
passes (member, non-member, or student) and still includes a year of OWASP 
membership (a $50 value).  If you are planning on attending, it would be a 
good idea to get your pass today by registering at http://www.lascon.org. 
If passes do not sell out, we will be offering them at the registration 
table at the conference tomorrow.  See you at LASCON!
