Subject: [Owasp-austin] Want to join the CEH Study Group?
Message-ID: <OF076A2980.74A445CB-ON86257776.006F1C48-86257776.00702E62@ni.com>

I'm curious if any other OWASPers are interested in getting their 
Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)?  This is the next certification on my list 
and James and I have been talking about putting together a study group for 
it.  We'd probably meet once a week over lunch for maybe a couple of 
hours.   The exam can be taken at any Prometric center for $250.  Here is 
some information on the different hacking concepts you learn as part of 
the CEH:

Module 01: Introduction to Ethical Hacking

Module 02: Hacking Laws
2
Module 03: Footprinting

Module 04: Google Hacking

Module 05: Scanning

Module 06: Enumeration

Module 07: System Hacking

Module 08: Trojans and Backdoors

Module 09: Viruses and Worms

Module 10: Sniffers

Module 11: Social Engineering

Module 12: Phishing

Module 13: Hacking Email Accounts

Module 14: Denial of Service

Module 15: Session Hijacking

Module 16: Hacking Webservers

Module 17: Web Application Vulnerabilities

Module 18: Web Based Password Cracking Techniques

Module 19: SQL Injection

Module 20: Hacking Wireless Networks

Module 21: Physical Security

Module 22: Linux Hacking

Module 23: Evading IDS, Honeypots and Firewalls

Module 24: Buffer Overflows

Module 25: Cryptography

Module 26: Penetration Testing Methodologies 

Send me an e-mail to let me know if you'd be interested in participating 
in our study group.  Thanks!

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON)
	2010 is Coming!
Message-ID: <OF2D1802F7.DC8E7F40-ON8625777A.0073D577-8625777A.007607EB@ni.com>

Hey Austin OWASPers!

On October 29, 2010 our chapter will be putting on the first-ever OWASP 
Regional Conference in Texas!  Although we've made a few mentions of it at 
chapter meetings and such, let this be our first official announcement 
that this conference is not only going to happen, but it is going to ROCK! 
 Sponsorships and CFP submissions continue to roll in on an almost daily 
basis and James and I are getting super excited about giving you what will 
soon become the best application security conference in the state for the 
absolute least amount of money possible.  Here's just a sample of people 
who have already submitted to speak at our conference:

Robert Hansen (CEO of SecTheory, LLC)
Chris Eng (Senior Director of Security Research, Veracode)
Dan Cornell (Principal, Denim Group)
Joe Jarzombek (Director for Software Assurance, Global Cyber Security 
Management, National Cyber Security Division, Department of Homeland 
Security)
Samy Kamkar (Yeah, the "MySpace Worm" Samy)

So here's the deal....conference attendance will be severely restricted 
due to space at the Norris Conference Center.  We've got room for about 
200 attendees and once those seats are sold, you won't be able to buy, 
beg, or cheat your way into the conference.  The good news is that James 
and I are proud to make this the single most affordable conference that 
I've ever heard of.  You get a full day of sessions from a literal "Who's 
Who" of the security industry for a mere $50 if you're already an OWASP 
member or $100 if you're not and that includes membership!  So what are 
you waiting for?  We're giving our Austin OWASPers the first shot at 
buying conference passes, but we can only wait a couple days.  After that, 
well, there's no telling how much longer we'll have available passes. 
Register with the following link:

If you are interested in presenting at the conference, the CFP is open 
through the end of August.  Submit your papers here:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2010

If you or your company is interested in sponsoring this awesome event, we 
still have a bunch of options for you.  Check out our sponsorship page 
here:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Lonestar_Application_Security_Conference_2010#tab=Sponsors

So there you have it folks...the first-ever OWASP Conference in Texas will 
be in Austin on October 29, 2010.  With quality presenters, affortable 
passes, and an awesome location, you can't go wrong.  Get your pass while 
they last!

  Topic: Application Assessments Reloaded                                   
                                                                            
  Trying to integrate Business Software Assurance into Enterprise Risk      
  Management and Information Security Management programs has had issues    
  over the years. Penetration-testing was announced dead over a year ago,   
  but it's still the number one choice of application security              
  professionals when starting out. Can the activities from                  
  penetration-testing be re-used and turned into something innovative?      
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Tools (especially application scanners and secure static analysis tools)  
  have error rates so high, they are useless in the hands of newcomers      
  (even for peripheral security testing). Some organizations have built     
  entire applications around or on top of existing appsec tools. Others are 
  looking to use other kinds of tools, such as process/methodology/workflow 
  tools, to enhance their classic penetration-testing tools.                
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Even the testing/inspection methodologies themselves are outdated and     
  we're finding that they are challenging or repetitive in many             
  environments. How do current appsec tools and testing/inspection methods  
  work in the cloud? If we re-run the same kinds of tests during dev-test,  
  software quality, and application security cycles, aren't we wasting      
  valuable time and effort?                                                 
                                                                            
                                                                            
  This presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of     
  these and other challenges in application security. The focus will be on  
  web applications that use common technologies (HTTP, SQL, Classic         
  XML/HTML, Javascript, Flash) but also updated to today's standards        
  (RESTful transactions, NoSQL, HTML5, Ajax/Json, Flex2).

  Andre got his start on Unix-TCP/IP hacking before the September that      
  never ended. Bored of embedded platform research by the time the dot-Bomb 
  happened, he joined the largest online auction company, worked as an      
  appsec consultant for many years, and recently joined a large online      
  gaming company. He is known for his quirky mailing-list posts and blog    
  comments -- and at one time wrote for tssci-security.com.

Austin OWASPers,

If you haven't registered yet for the Lonestar Application Security 
Conference (LASCON) on October 29, 2010, do it now or risk it being sold 
out when you finally get around to it.  We've begun advertising the 
conference to the other Texas OWASP chapters and other security 
organizations in the area and registrations continue to pour in.  The CFPs 
are ending in a week and soon thereafter we will be announcing the 
official schedule for LASCON to the general public.  Once the schedule has 
been released, we are expecting a large increase in the already steady 
stream of registrations.  Get your pass today!

	LASCON
Message-ID: <OF25CFDD4B.954CB7FD-ON8625778A.00796063-8625778A.007AFEE8@ni.com>

Austin OWASPers,

While there is still another week or so left for CFP submissions, the 
LASCON planning committee today voted on acceptance of the first batch of 
speakers and presentations for the conference.  Hopefully this preliminary 
list will get you guys as excited as I am about LASCON:

Presentation
Name
OWASP Top 10.  What is it all about?
Dean Bushmiller
Deconstructing ColdFusion
Chris Eng
HTTPS Can Byte Me
Robert Hasen and Josh Sokol
Smart Phones with Dumb Apps: Threat Modeling for Mobile Applications
Dan Cornell
How I Met Your Girlfriend
Samy Kamkar
Mitigating Business Risks with Application Security
Joe Jarzombek
Automating Web Testing Beyond OWASP Webscarab Using Python
Brad Causey
Everything Useful I Learned About Software Security, I Learned At 
Microsoft
Michael Howard

That's two presentations from this years BlackHat conference, several 
published authors, and the Director for Software Assurance in the National 
Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security just to 
name a few, and that's only the preliminary round of acceptances.  The 
complete list and schedule won't be out for a couple of weeks, but we're 
seeing a steady stream of registrations and passes may not last that long. 
 At only $50 for OWASP members and $100 for non-members (includes a year 
of OWASP membership) for a full day of training, this should be a 
no-brainer.  Register for LASCON today and be sure to tell your friends 
and co-workers to get their passes before they sell out!

Conference Website: http://www.lascon.org

We'd also like to thank Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, Splunk, and Impact 
Security LLC for being Gold Sponsors of LASCON 2010!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol

Austin OWASPers,

I hope that you are all doing well.  Can you believe that it's almost 
September?  This year has flown by so quickly, but it's not over yet.  In 
fact, I'd say that we have more going on now than ever before.  What 
follows is a list of OWASP and other security events that may interest you 
over the next few months.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Tuesday, August 31, 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM > OWASP Meeting: Application 
Assessments Reloaded (Andre Gironda)
Trying to integrate Business Software Assurance into Enterprise Risk 
Management and Information Security Management programs has had issues 
over the years. Penetration-testing was announced dead over a year ago, 
but it's still the number one choice of application security professionals 
when starting out. Can the activities from penetration-testing be re-used 
and turned into something innovative?  Tools (especially application 
scanners and secure static analysis tools) have error rates so high, they 
are useless in the hands of newcomers (even for peripheral security 
testing). Some organizations have built entire applications around or on 
top of existing appsec tools. Others are looking to use other kinds of 
tools, such as process/methodology/workflow tools, to enhance their 
classic penetration-testing tools.  Even the testing/inspection 
methodologies themselves are outdated and we're finding that they are 
challenging or repetitive in many environments. How do current appsec 
tools and testing/inspection methods work in the cloud? If we re-run the 
same kinds of tests during dev-test, software quality, and application 
security cycles, aren't we wasting valuable time and effort?  This 
presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of these and 
other challenges in application security. The focus will be on web 
applications that use common technologies (HTTP, SQL, Classic XML/HTML, 
Javascript, Flash) but also updated to today's standards (RESTful 
transactions, NoSQL, HTML5, Ajax/Json, Flex2).  See 
http://austin.owasp.org for more information,

September 16, 2010, 5 PM - 7 PM > Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour 
(Sponsored by F5 and Accuvant)
Hopefully you know the drill by now.  One Thursday every month we get a 
group of the coolest security professionals in Austin to gather at 
Sherlock's for a couple of hours of food, drinks, and chatter.  Sometimes 
our conversations are about security and sometimes they're about life, but 
they're almost always something worth talking about.  Next month is no 
exception and we would like to thank F5 and Accuvant for stepping up to 
sponsor this awesome event.  If you haven't made it out to one of these 
happy hours yet, you're missing out.  See http://austin.owasp.org for more 
information,

September 27 - 29 > ConSec: A New Decade of Information Security
Yesterday's risks are known, but what about tomorrow's?  We are entering a 
New Decade of Information Security!  ConSec is a 2.5 day conference here 
in Austin, TX at the Norris Conference Center.  Of particular interest to 
Austin OWASPers is a full-day specialty workshop on September 29 by Matt 
Tesauro on "How to Use the OWASP Live CD", a talk by John Dickson (Denim 
Group) on "Preparing for Tomorrow's Threats: A Primer for Security 
Responses in an Accelerated World", and a talk by Josh Sokol (National 
Instruments) on "Architecting Secure Web Systems",  It is $335 for a full 
conference registration or $125 for just the workshop if you register 
before 9/9.  See http://www.consec.org for more information.

September 28, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM > OWASP Meeting: Technology and 
Business Risk Management: How Application Security Fits In (Peter 
Perfetti)
This presentation demonstrates how important application security is to 
the overall stability and security of the infrastructure and the 
ultimately, the business. Presented from the Information Security 
Officer/Risk Manager point of view, it shows how a strong information 
security program reduces levels of reputational, operational, legal, and 
strategic risk by limiting vulnerabilities, increasing stability, and 
maintaining customer confidence and trust. It focuses on the top concerns 
of risk managers and how application security fits into the overall risk 
management process. The audience will be given recommendations on how to 
improve cost effectiveness and efficiency to achieve business, security, 
audit, and compliance objectives relative to applications.  See 
http://austin.owasp.org for more information.

October 21, 2010 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM > ISSA Meeting: Emerging Threats
See http://www.austinissa.org for more information.

October 29, 2010 > LASCON: Lonestar Applicaton Security Conference
LASCON will have three distinct tracks spanning a single day.  A track for 
management topics such as risk management and securing the SDLC, a track 
for technical topics such as logic flaws and HTTPS protocol issues, and a 
track for OWASP topics such as the OWASP Top 10 and the Webscarab proxy. 
With CFPs still open for LASCON, we have already confirmed presentations 
from some of the world's top security professionals.  You can look forward 
to presentations from the likes of Robert Hansen, Dan Cornell, Samy 
Kamkar, Joe Jarzombek, Michael Howard and many more.  Attendees who 
register before 9/15/2010 will pay only $50 if they are already OWASP 
members and $100 if they are not which includes a full year of OWASP 
membership.  We guarantee that this full day of training will be the most 
"bang for your buck" that any conference in Texas has to offer.  See 
http://www.lascon.org for more information.

November 4, 2010 > HouSecCon
I just found out about this conference yesterday through the Houston OWASP 
mailing list and it truly rivals LASCON for the most "bang for your buck". 
 They will have only two tracks, Mangement and "Hacking", but have an 
impressive list of presenters.  Robert Hansen (SecTheory), Jeremiah 
Grossman (WhiteHat), and Branden Williams (RSA Security Consulting) are 
just a few of the names who will be presenting there.  If only it weren't 
in Houston.  ;-)  This conference looks awesome and at only $25 to 
register you should all seriously consider going.  Maybe I'll form a 
carpool so let me know if you want to go.  See http://houstonseccon.com 
for more information.

November 18, 2010 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM > ISSA Meeting: Forrester Half-Day 
with Khalid Kark
See http://www.austinissa.org for more information.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
