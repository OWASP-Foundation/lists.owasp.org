<PRE>Josh,

We completed our 6th internal CISSP study group session at Dell this
past Spring and were just discussing starting our 7th study group.

I'd like to join forces and have a few of my certified and my
non-certified people participate.

You may want to consider shortening the meeting from 3 hours and only
conducting a 1 hour per week meeting and including a conference bridge.
I'm willing to supply the bridge if people cannot attend in person, plus
most of us are very busy and can only focus/retain the material at most
in a 90 minute period once a week.

Also, we use Shon Harris' All-in-One CISSP Exam Guide 4th Edition
(includes a cdrom) and go through each chapter every week. We start on
chapter 3 (Risk Management) since the first 2 chapters are introductory.
The review book has 10 chapters of content and roughly takes us 12-14
weeks to complete (we've found 2-3 chapters take more than 1 session).

I hope this helps and completely flexible and supportive of this
community activity.

Thanks,

Phil Agcaoili, CISM, CISSP

Hello,

Wondering if anyone out there in OWASP land is interested in being a
part 
of the CISSP study group that I am starting up next Tuesday?  The study 
group will meet in the same location as the OWASP meetings (National 
Instruments) from 6-9 PM every Tuesday for the next 11 weeks.  This will

give us enough time to cover the 10 domains of security as well as a
week 
for review prior to the CISSP exam here in Austin.  The tentative
schedule 
is below.  Please e-mail me back if you would like to participate.
Thanks!

About the Study Group: I am organizing this study group out of my 
interests in security and my desire to take the CISSP exam.  All of you 
have expressed an interest to me at one time or another in being a part
of 
the study group or in obtaining your CISSP certification so you are 
receiving this invite.  Please let me know now if you are not willing to

seriously contribute to the study group.  We will begin the study group
on 
September 29, 2009 with an in-person meeting of all interested parties. 
Dean has graciously offered to lead the discussion on this date, but 
please make sure that you have read your text's section on &quot;Access 
Control&quot; prior to attending.  I will need each person to pick three 
domains that they would like to lead the discussions on.  These can be 
domains that you know everything about or nothing about.  It doesn't 
matter.  The goal is for us all to learn here.  Please send me your list

of three domains ASAP and I will assign everyone 1-2 primary and 1-2 
alternate slots.  I will do my best to make sure that you get your
desired 
section, but I can't guarantee anything.  Thanks.

Textbook: You are free to chose your own textbook.  I have a copy of
Mike 
Meyers' CISSP(R) Certification Passport by Shon Harris that I will be 
using likely amongst other texts.  Everyone must have at least one 
textbook that they can bring with them to the study group.
