*Topic: * OWASP ROI: Optimize Security Spending using OWASP

Considering the current economic times, security spending is tighter than
ever. This presentation will cover the Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP) projects and how they can improve your application security posture
in a budget-friendly way. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling
organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications that can be
trusted. The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit entity and provides
unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security.
Projects covered include the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Testing Guide, Enterprise
Security API (ESAPI), Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS),
Application Security Desk Reference (ASDR) and others. A case study of a
specific company's success with implementing OWASP methodologies and tools
will also be provided. In this case study the company realized annual
reduction in spending of several hundred thousand dollars.
