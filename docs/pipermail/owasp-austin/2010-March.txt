Twenty years ago the Secret Service raided a lot of hackers and
phreakers. ?Locally they busted Steve Jackson's company, seized his
computers, BBS, and office equipment. ?These events led directly to
the formation of EFF-Austin, the EFF, and indirectly to many of the
other cyber rights organizations we have today.

Join Steve Jackson, Bruce Sterling and others as we discuss the
events, the changes, and the future of cyber rights.

It's free (but donations to offset event costs are welcomed).

It's got free beer from Independence Breewing.

That's sort of right, the EFF formed and it was supposed to have various chapters. During that process it was decided not to have chapters so EFF Austin (EFF Texas) broke away. It's important that these two groups not be confused as they have a very divergent perspective and ethos with regard to where they draw the line on civil liberties. In general you'll find the local EFF Austin group is a bit more conservative and as a result tends to support legislation and activities that put a little more limit on personal freedom.

They busted Steve's company because Loyd Blankenship (The Mentor) was working there as the editor on the Cyberpunks books and the SS felt it was a handbook to hack. They also got Chris (Erik Bloodaxe). Part of the confusion was they thought that the SJG BBS was part of Loyd's Phoenix Project BBS (I was #19 Ravage).

Another group that formed in part because of this that was international and local was the Cypherpunks (http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/02/2082 ).

	(Sponsored by Denim Group)

Hello Austin OWASPers,

Hopefully this e-mail finds you all outside somewhere enjoying this 
beautiful day here in Austin, TX.  It's days like today that remind me why 
I came down here from the frozen tundra that is Minnesota almost 13 years 
ago now. 

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, Thursday, March 18, 5-7 PM
I wanted to remind everyone of the upcoming Austin Security Professionals 
Happy Hour sponsored by the Denim Group on Thursday, March 18 from 5 - 7 
PM.  As usual, the event will be at Sherlock's at 183 and Burnet and we 
have the regular party room reserved.  That said, if it turns out to be as 
nice a day as it is today, perhaps our group will creep out onto the patio 
instead.  As usual, you'll find no better opportunity to get out and 
network with your fellow security practitioners in a super fun and 
friendly environment.  And this time we can sincerely thank the Denim 
Group for providing us all with tasty beverages and nourishment at this 
awesome event.  Don't worry about SXSW either, Sherlocks is not a SXSW 
venue and they'll have plenty of parking and it's business as usual for 
them.  See you there!

OWASP Meeting, Enterprise Application Security Practices, Tuesday, March 
30, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
Also, please make sure to mark your calendar for the March OWASP meeting 
on it's regular day and time on Tuesday, March 30 from 11:30 AM to 1:00 
PM.  This months presentation on Enterprise Application Security 
Practices: Real-world Tips and Techniques by Addison, Chad, and Mike from 
Dell is going to be awesome. 

And if you haven't signed up yet, be sure you get on 
http://austinowasp.ning.com to RSVP for events, participate in 
discussions, and much more.  Take care!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CCNA, GWAS)

  Topic: Enterprise Application Security Practices: Real-world Tips and     
  Techniques                                                                
                                                                            
  How can you re-energize your company?s or institution?s commitment to     
  secure development practices as part of the SDLC, while keeping costs in  
  check? Dell's Security Consulting team created an application security    
  practice with the help of several internal teams in legal, enterprise     
  architecture, vendor management, privacy, compliance, and network         
  engineering. Team members Addison Lawrence, Chad Barker, and Mike Craigue 
  will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities they have faced     
  over the last three years, ramping from 27 project engagements in 2007,   
  to 726 project engagements in 2009. In this session, we will discuss the  
  creation of policies/standards, deploying a Security Development          
  Lifecycle as an overlay to the SDLC, overcoming concerns of developers    
  and business partners, and addressing global standardization issues. Also 
  included: awareness/education/training, application security user groups, 
  security consulting staff development, risk assessments, security         
  reviews, threat modeling, source code scans, deployment scans,            
  penetration testing, exception management, and executive escalations.     
  Tell us what we might do to improve our program and increase our          
  effectiveness; discuss how you could adapt parts of this approach to your 
  own program.

  was part of Loyd's Phoenix Project BBS (I was #19 Ravage).

A friend of mine gave me his copy of that book (GURPS Cypherpunks)
recently.  The fact that the SS shut that down is kind of funny...  it
has some ideas but is in no way a manual, lacks any technical details.
There were much more detailed books out at the time, like "Out of the
Inner Circle".  Not that that has anything to do with anything, since
it's clearly a First Amendment issue.

On the topic of crypto, cypherpunks, and privacy, Steven Levy put out
a book called "Crypto" that is supposed to deal with the topic.  I
have a copy but haven't had a chance to read it yet.

Matt Blaze also did an interesting Silver Bullet podcast that covered
the issue.  What I remember of what he said is that the movement
started when it became feasible to start doing crypto in software at
no marginal cost.  Until that time, most crypto was done in
special-purpose hardware units that were expensive and under tighter
control.

Although it seems like we're out of the woods on that particular
issue, DMCA and other laws are still restricting certain kinds of
software.  I recall a judge issing a ruling that software wasn't
speech, since it had a functional purpose - you can execute code.
However, I find this argument specious; I've always felt that the act
of programming is very much like speech, in that you're explaining how
to do something; the only difference is that you're being very precise
in doing so.

Bloodaxe/Goggans told me that one shouldn't take "The Hacker
Crackdown" as gospel.  In particular, he said that he was not woken
with a gun to his head, as reported.  And the way he knew about the
impending Secret Service raid is that after requesting his student
records, UT/Austin was obligated by state law to inform him.

If you're interested in crypto then get Koblitz's "A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography" and Schnier's "Applied Cryptography". They're both pretty old now, but the basic math hasn't changed a lot. I also very much like Stoll's "The Cuckoo's Egg" as I was hacking around with the Black Monks from Amsterdam on Amigas and there was a constant buzz about the CCC goings on. I got to chat with Pengo on a bridge for about a minute once. I still regularly use my 2nd edition red covered "Applied Cryptography" for a shibboleth for meetings (like Hacking Society).

Matt and I don't see eye to eye on many things. Crypto has been around for quite a while, Khan's book "The Codebreakers" and the publishing of the knapsack algorithms in the 70's is really what kicked off a wave of civilian interest. At this same time it was clear through the growth of the Arpanet that there was going to be a use for this technology. We used to have a hands-on science museum in Austin called Discovery Hall. I was one of the founders along with some others including Dr. Jack Turner ( http://order.ph.utexas.edu/ ) and took care of their BBS and computer SIG among other things. We did a project one summer doing stego on a C64 using the LSB and some XOR padding to whiten the bit sequence (86 I think). What Matt's talking about is probably true for a lot of military and high end commercial apps, but most of it was more algorithmic and done on the Nova or 360 that the business had.

I still have the floppy for the PGP 1.0 that I downloaded to my Amiga from Adelante BBS when Zimmerman put it up that first night. Bass-o-matic :)

Somebody should teach him about NLP then.

That's funny. I haven't talked to Chris since the last HoHoCon. You should ask him about the 4th of July Bar-b-q at Rick Wallingford's old place over off Burnet (I think it was Houston street ???). There were these two guys down the street sitting in a car, somebody noticed the badge on his belt when he got out to stretch. We used to play poker over there on Wed. nights all the time for several years. I wonder if Chris still has the Ms. Pac Man machine, I still have the Stargate arcade machine. We had bought them from Rick and when they busted Chris they were trying to charge him on stolen property over it at one point.

I'ts worth mentioning that to be accurate the bust of LoD/MoD and Sundevil were two separate operations. I think had LoD and MoD not been at war the bust wouldn't have been as probable. I guess that's what happens when you call somebody "nigger" on a bridge :) I can't remember if Lex Luthor said it or was called it to be honest.

Hello Austin OWASPers!

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, Thursday, March 18, 5-7 PM
I wanted to remind everyone of the upcoming Austin Security Professionals 
Happy Hour sponsored by the Denim Group this Thursday, March 18 from 5 - 7 
PM.  As usual, the event will be at Sherlock's at 183 and Burnet and we 
have the regular party room reserved.  That said, if it turns out to be as 
nice a day as it is today, perhaps our group will creep out onto the patio 
instead.  As usual, you'll find no better opportunity to get out and 
network with your fellow security practitioners in a super fun and 
friendly environment.  And this time we can sincerely thank the Denim 
Group for providing us all with tasty beverages and nourishment at this 
awesome event.  Don't worry about SXSW either, Sherlocks is not a SXSW 
venue and they'll have plenty of parking and it's business as usual for 
them.  See you there!

Forensics Birds of a Feather, Tuesday, March 23, 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM
This just in....Capitol of Texas ISSA has extended an invitation to the 
first "Lucky 7" OWASP members to a very special Birds of a Feather event 
on Forensics happening from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM on Tuesday, March 23 
(dinner provided).  The event will feature two technical sessions on (1) 
forensics of fibre channel drives using a desktop PC and (2) computer 
forensic methodologies and cellphone data extraction.  For additional 
details and to RSVP, please see the attached PDF document.

OWASP Meeting, Enterprise Application Security Practices, Tuesday, March 
30, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
Also, please make sure to mark your calendar for the March OWASP meeting 
on it's regular day and time on Tuesday, March 30 from 11:30 AM to 1:00 
PM.  This months presentation on Enterprise Application Security 
Practices: Real-world Tips and Techniques by Addison, Chad, and Mike from 
Dell is going to be awesome. 

And if you haven't signed up yet, be sure you get on 
http://austinowasp.ning.com to RSVP for events, participate in 
discussions, and much more.  Take care!

Hello Austin OWASPers!

I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who came out to last week's 
happy hour.  I hope that you had as much fun networking with everyone as I 
did.  I overheard some VERY interesting conversations.  Also, a huge thank 
you to the Denim Group for sponsoring the event.  The only thing better 
than networking with security professionals at a happy hour is drinking 
and eating for free while you are doing it! 

If you haven't done so yet, be sure to get signed up for our Ning group 
located at:

http://austinowasp.ning.com/

Here's a list of some of our upcoming events for Austin OWASP:

March 30, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM: Enterprise Application Security 
Practices: Real-world Tips and Techniques (OWASP Meeting)
How can you re-energize your company?s or institution?s commitment to 
secure development practices as part of the SDLC, while keeping costs in 
check? Dell's Security Consulting team created an application security 
practice with the help of several internal teams in legal, enterprise 
architecture, vendor management, privacy, compliance, and network 
engineering. Team members Addison Lawrence, Chad Barker, and Mike Craigue 
will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities they have faced over 
the last three years, ramping from 27 project engagements in 2007, to 726 
project engagements in 2009. In this session, we will discuss the creation 
of policies/standards, deploying a Security Development Lifecycle as an 
overlay to the SDLC, overcoming concerns of developers and business 
partners, and addressing global standardization issues. Also included: 
awareness/education/training, application security user groups, security 
consulting staff development, risk assessments, security reviews, threat 
modeling, source code scans, deployment scans, penetration testing, 
exception management, and executive escalations. Tell us what we might do 
to improve our program and increase our effectiveness; discuss how you 
could adapt parts of this approach to your own program. 

April 22, 2010, 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Austin Security Professionals Happy 
Hour
If you haven't been to one of these yet, you should definitely go.  As 
usual it will be at Sherlock's (9012 Research Blvd) and is the best 
opportunity you'll find to network with your fellow security 
professionals.  Thanks in advance to Fortify for sponsoring the April 
event for us!

April 27, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM: Automated vs Manual Security: You 
can't filter the stupid (OWASP Meeting)
Everyone wants to stretch their security budget, and automated application 
security tools are an appealing choice for doing so. However, manual 
security testing isn?t going anywhere until the HAL application scanner 
comes online. This presentation will use often humorous, real-world 
examples to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of automated 
solutions and manual techniques. 

Automated tools have some strengths, namely low incremental cost, 
detecting simple vulnerabilities, and performing highly repetitive tasks. 
However, automated solutions are far from perfect. There are entire 
classes of vulnerabilities that are theoretically impossible for automated 
software to detect. Examples include complex information leakage, race 
conditions, logic flaws, design flaws, and multistage process attacks. 
Beyond that, there are many vulnerabilities that are too complicated or 
obscure to practically detect with an automated tool. 

Hopefully we'll see you soon!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
