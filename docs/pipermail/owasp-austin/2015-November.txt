Howdy Austin OWASP-ers!

The chapter is taking a short hiatus like we always do with the last two
months of the year, gotta get over LASCON somehow --  it was a great
conference!  LASCON keeps getting better every year!

While we aren't spearheading any activity this month, ISSA Austin is
coordinating a happy hour next week on November 12th!

*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Austin ISSA (Capitol
of Texas Chapter)*

Please join us on Thursday, Nov 12 from 5:30 to 7:30 at the Park at the
Domain.  We?ll be on the covered side patio.  No corporate sponsor, no
presentation, just an opportunity to share a beer, a bite, and good
conversation with like-minded Security Professionals!



The Park Domain

11601 Domain Drive

Austin, TX 78758
www.theparkdomain.com


Come out and join everyone at a new location for the event!  (30 minutes
later too!)

Also,   the OWASP Study Group continues on with discussions regarding
"Snapshot" by Dan Korem.  Come join the discussions every Thursday from
12-1 at National Instruments.. but checkout the Ning site to make sure they
are meeting, as holidays and events make scheduling interesting this time
of year -- http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup
