Austin OWASPers,

At midnight tonight I officially pass the title of OWASP Austin
President to Kyle Smith. I look forward to what we have ahead of us as a
chapter under Kyle's leadership. Please do all you can to support and
encourage Kyle!

I wanted to thank you all for two very full, fun years! The OWASP
Community means a lot to me, and I'll still be around, helping where I
can and working to make LASCON 2014 our best conference ever!

Have a great New Year. See you all in 2014!

David H.

Thank you David for two outstanding years of service to OWASP Austin and
the Austin security community.

Congratulations Kyle on your new post leading the OWASP Austin Chapter.
David left us in very capable hands and look forward to everything that the
coming years have in store for us.

Happy New Year everyone and I look forward to seeing all of you again in
2014!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
