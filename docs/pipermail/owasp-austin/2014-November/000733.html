<PRE>For those of you wondering what is happening with the OWASP Austin Study
Group, we have been on a little hiatus after finishing up our last topic.
Between activities with LASCON, which wrapped up about 10 days ago, and my
own work-related priorities, I am just now getting around to moving forward
with organizing the next topic selection.  My apologies for the delay.

As mentioned in previous emails, we manage our communication about study
group topics via a Ning social website - <A HREF="http://myowasp.ning.com/.">http://myowasp.ning.com/.</A>
Specifically, we have a group named OWASP Austin Study Group
&lt;<A HREF="http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup">http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup</A>&gt; that contains
discussion forums.  And even more specific to that is a discussion forum
named Future Study Group Ideas (Ongoing Discussion Forum
&lt;<A HREF="http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/future-study-group-ideas-ongoing-discussion-forum">http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/future-study-group-ideas-ongoing-discussion-forum</A>&gt;).
If you are interested in participating in the study group, please sign up
for the Ning website, join the *OWASP Austin Study Group*, and post any
ideas you have to the *Future Study Group Ideas* forum.

As for the next topic, we are in the process of narrowing the options and
selecting one.  I hope to have this done within the next week or two.

As for when we will meet next:

   - We will NOT meeting this Thursday, November 6th.


   - With the Thanksgiving holiday coming up at the end of the month, we
   may only have one or two times to meet this month (Thursday, November 13th
   and Thursday, November 20th).  So the likelihood of getting the next topic
   started this month will be tough, especially with time needed to obtain any
   books or other resources.  We do not need to rush into a new topic, though,
   so my main concern is to ensure that those who want to participate are
   aware of the status.


   - With that said, if anyone has something they would like to discuss as
   a &quot;one-off&quot; topic, where it would only take one or two meeting times to
   cover, please contact me with that information and I can coordinate setting
   it up and communicating to others.

I will send a follow-up email as more information is available.

Thanks for your patience.
