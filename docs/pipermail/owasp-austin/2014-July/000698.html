<PRE>Howdy Austin-area OWASPers!

We would like to make to give huge thank you to last months speaker Vern
Williams for stepping up the night before the chapter meeting and filling
in and presenting a great talk!  Fortunately, we will still get the
Railsgoat presentation, just a month later then planned (please airlines,
don't mess up our plans again.)   Thank you again Vern!

Did you know we have a one of the best regional conferences coming for two
days in October?   Did you know we have some of the best keynote speakers
announced on the conference website?  LASCON is coming sooner then you
think!!!  Go to the conference site and check it out -- lascon.org

-- Next Week!
*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour Sponsored by iSEC Partners, July
10th*

*When: *Thursday, July 10th, 5-7PM
*Where: *Sherlocks Street Pub and Grill 9012 Research Blvd

*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.  (No chapter or organization membership is needed to attend.)

*Sponsor:*

assessment of application and network security. Founded in 2004, with
offices in San Francisco, New York, Seattle, and Austin, iSEC Partners
provides tailored security services to many Fortune 500 clients. iSEC

*RSVP*: <A HREF="https://aus-sec-happy-hour-2014-07.eventbrite.com">https://aus-sec-happy-hour-2014-07.eventbrite.com</A>

*OWASP monthly meeting on July 29th*

*When: *11:30AM to 1PM CST -- food socializing first, meeting starts around
11:45
*Location: *National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac Building C

*Title: Railsgoat*
Abstract: While working to secure rails applications in a truly Agile
development environment, it became clear that the Rails and Ruby ecosystem
needed attention from the security community in the form of free and open
training. RailsGoat is an attempt to bring attention to both the problems
that most frequently occur in Rails as well as solutions for remediation.
This talk will discuss Railsgoat, common issues, defensive measures, and
engage the audience for feedback/improvements.

*Speaker: *
*Ken Johnson *is the CTO of nVisium and leads the company's product
development efforts. Ken is obsessed with code security and code in general
but holds a special place in his heart for Ruby. Ken is passionate about
the open source community, and genuinely loves to create.

*Food: *Taco Deli! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough for all!

*Drawings*: Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways
that may take place!   Did you know who won the LASCON admission or any of
the other giveaways last month?

meeting or two or just want to start, the study group is a great place to
learn security related materials like the latest book -- The Practice of
Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection and Response
by Richard Bejtlich
