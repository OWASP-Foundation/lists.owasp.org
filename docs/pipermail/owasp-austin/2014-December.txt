Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Austin Study Group - new topic postponed until
	January 8th
Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu-8Wee9ALGwNze9A9m4hzrHJhHFxY2yyrGqUmkcqJcfyA@mail.gmail.com>

We had planned to start the next study group topic - See the forum
titled "Study
Group - The Browser Hacker's Handbook
<http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-the-browser-hacker-s-handbook>"
- tomorrow, Thursday, December 11th.  However, there have been quite a few
who stated they could not make it to this first meeting, and with the
holidays and all, it would be best to just start in January. This also
gives everyone more time to get the book.


So with that, *we will plan to start Thursday, January 8th, 2015*.



FYI, the information about the study group can be found on the OWASP Austin
(Ning) site: http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup.  It
lists when and where we typically meet.  If you wish to participate, I
would suggest signing up for the Ning site, then joining the "OWASP Austin
Study Group" group.  A new forum discussion thread has been created for
this next topic -
http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-the-browser-hacker-s-handbook,
which you would want to "follow" to receive email updates on status of the
specific study group topic. If you want to participate, then you will find
the book information noted in the discussion forum description.


If any questions or concerns, please let me know.



Happy Holidays!!

OWASP Monthly Meeting -- next on January 27th!

CryptoParty!

In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'
where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without
privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or
station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may
express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being
coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet of today is an amazing
place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr.
Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to
to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy
and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.
CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these
solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to
privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR,
full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend,
public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 27, 2015 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first ever
CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about
the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy. We
encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this
event. Presentations will be laid out so that novice and experienced alike
can take action based on the data presented. All tools presented will be
free and open source. Our CryptoParty will end with the first-ever OWASP
Austin Key Signing Party. Don't miss this meeting and be sure to invite
your friends!

Speaker: Several ! -- Lead by Josh Sokol

FYI -- the CHFI training mentioned in the last months newsletter has been
moved by Austin ISSA to February --

Austin ISSA - Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (CHFI) Training
February 9-13 @ Norris Conference Center in Austin

Come learn the essential hands-on skills needed to take your security game
to the next level. Whether you?re part of an incident response team or
investigating a computer crime, you need to figure out what they did, what
they changed and what they deleted so you can determine the best path. You
will learn how hackers and malicious users hide data, delete data and
attempt to hide their tracks. You will learn how to uncover what they have
deleted and how to follow the trail they left behind. You will also learn
how to be a first responder at a computer crime scene, how to handle
evidence, duplicate disks, investigate wireless attacks, investigate web
attacks, do mobile forensics and a myriad of other key skills.

Austin ISSA invites you to take the CHFI training the week of February 9th
- at the Norris Conference Center. This course normally costs $3000, but we
are offering it to ISSA members for only $1150! The course includes a
voucher for the CHFI certification (worth $500) and access to online labs
so you can practice the hands-on skills you learned. Class enrollment is
limited, so sign up <http://austin-chfi.eventbrite.com/> early because it?s
expected to sell out.
