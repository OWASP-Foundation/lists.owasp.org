Message-ID: <502BB8A9.9050406@owasp.org>

Austin OWASPers,

Just a reminder that there will be no study group today due to a
conflict with this week's ISSA Meeting. ISSA usually meets on Thursday
but had to move it this week. It was the consensus of those who attended
last week that the study group meeting this week should be canceled. We
will resume next week with chapter three of the Metasploit book.

For those who do (or are planning to) attend the Study Group, remember
to register at http://my.owasp.org for discussion and other important
information.


Thanks

David H.
