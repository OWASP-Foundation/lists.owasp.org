<PRE>Austin OWASPers!

Upcoming events --

Don't forget this week that we are hosting the *OWASP study group*.  On
Wednesday, the study group will continue with *Web Application Defender's
Cookbook: Battling Hackers and Protecting Users&quot;*.  They are meeting
at National
Instruments, Building A, Room 217 from 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM.

Please remember that the next Security Professional Happy Hour is on
February 20th.  (The date is moved due out to venue conflicts due to
Valentines Day activities.)  More information to follow.

And hopefully the final update regarding the meeting on January 28th --

The chapter meeting is scheduled for January 28 from 11:30-1 at National
Instruments, Building C (the regular place).  It will be a great meeting
