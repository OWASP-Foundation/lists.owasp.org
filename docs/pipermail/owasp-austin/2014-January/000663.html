<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers,

  Welcome to a new year!  My name is Kyle Smith and I'm the newly appointed
chapter President for the Austin Chapter of OWASP.  I hope to grow the
chapter and continue in the great directions that the past presidents have
taken the chapter.  If anyone has ideas for the chapter, sponsorship ideas,
or anything related please contact me at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">kyle.smith at owasp.org.</A>   In the
mean time, here are some of the upcoming events for January --
