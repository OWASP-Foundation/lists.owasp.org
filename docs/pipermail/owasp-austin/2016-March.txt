Subject: [Owasp-austin] Austin OWASP Study Group topic - OWASP Hacking Lab training


Hi Austin OWASP,

Our next study group topic has been chosen. We will be going through the OWASP Hacking Lab at https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html

We will be starting with the OWASP Top Ten challenge first. So, we will be learning about the mechanics of each vulnerability and how they are exploited.

These include:

1) SQL injection
2) Cross-site scripting (XSS)
3) Broken authentication & session management
4) Insecure direct object references
5) Cross site request forger (CSRF)
6) Security misconfiguration
7) Insecure cryptographic storage
8) Failure to restrict URL access
9) Insufficient transport layer protection
10) Unvalidated redirects & forwards.

Our first meeting on March 3 will be making sure everyone is reading to go, i.e. they have an account and can get connected to the labs.

People who want to participate will need to do the following:

1) Go to https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html and register an account
2) Go to security events and click "Register Now" for the OWASP Top Ten challenge
3) Go to the download section and select the download option you want. You can download a virtual machine (vmware, virtualbox) or a live CD iso. It is important to use one of their images because you will need to make a VPN connection to their labs in order to work on the challenges.

This should be a ton of fun!

Email me if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Matt Pardo

Hello all!


This month's OWASP Austin Chapter meeting will be on Tuesday, March 29,
2016.  *Please **RSVP on Eventbrite*
<http://owasp-austin-2016-march.eventbrite.com> so that the food order can

Following are the details of the meeting:


------------------------------------------------------------


OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, March 29th from 11:30 AM
to 1:00 PM


*Lean Security*


Moving fast is a business imperative that you can?t afford to be in
opposition to. Lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery philosophies hinge on
the ability to move fast through collaboration, automation, and aligning
with the flow of the organization. Security needs to be able to make the
same transformation.


As a concrete example of applying these approaches to security, we will
show how a platform automation approach to security increases transparency
and visibility throughout the organization and pairs with the
high-throughput philosophies of DevOps and Continuous Delivery, while
working with the way the business functions and not against it.


>From this session, you will:

   - Understand the Lean, Agile, and DevOps techniques emerging in
   organizations today
   - Be armed with organizational strategies for bridging devops and
   security
   - Apply Lean thinking to security operations.

*Speaker: *Ernest Mueller


Ernest Mueller is a 20-year IT veteran who has led a variety of teams
designing, building and operating SaaS and Web products for companies large
and small. Frequently, that has involved innovating Agile, DevOps, and
cloud transformations to meet the needs of the modern marketplace. He
writes about these topics at theagileadmin.com. Ernest is also active in
advocating for the Austin technologist community, and organizes events like
DevOpsDays Austin and user groups like CloudAustin. As Lean Systems Manager
for AlienVault, he focuses on empowering the technical teams and creating a
high velocity path to deliver value to customers. Ernest resides in Austin,
