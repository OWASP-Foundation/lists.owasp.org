<PRE>Hello everyone!



I apologize for this late announcement, but we *will be* meeting up
for the *Austin
Security Professionals Happy Hour *for September this *Thursday, September
13th*.  Same location - Baby A's on Stonelake Blvd in North Austin.


Unfortunately we have not been able to get a sponsor for the happy hour,
meaning that any food or drinks you order will be on your own tab.
Hopefully that will not be a deterrent for you to attend, as it is always
great to see and chat with each other about what all is going on in the
Austin security community.


Also, this will be the last happy hour until next January.


Here are the details:


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for September*

*When:* Thursday, September 13th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where: *Baby A's, 9505-B Stonelake Blvd, Austin, Texas 78759 (corner of
Stonelake and York Blvd, between Hwy 183 and Mopac).  We will meet in the
area inside the restaurant, in the far left corner.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

*Sponsor:* None.

Please *RSVP* so that we can get a headcount of how many attendees to
expect:
