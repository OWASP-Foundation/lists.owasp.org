Hello Everyone!

New research into application security practices at over 100 companies will
be presented, covering software security strategies and tactics as they are
practiced in the wild, based on the new BSIMM6 dataset. Statistics will be
balanced with war stories from the field to illustrate foundational
principles of starting and sustaining programs, as well as ?what not to do?
gotchas that can kill an initiative in its tracks.

that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased (partially or wholly) before, it will fall under
current research category even though there are enhancements/changes
to the original
research.

2. Current Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Have you presented or submitted this paper at any other conference(s),
magazine(s) or portals?
Yes, No.
If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the previous
ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or are due

Yes/No.
(If Yes, how many? Also please explain each demo)

Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

Paper Abstract ? Please provide detailed working or your
research/work. The more details you provide the better it is for the
reviewers. Please keep the abstract to the point. Please do not try to
hide the technical details or say ?I can?t disclose it till bla bla?
as it does not help the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a
low score because of insufficient information available in the
abstract. Please make sure to add as much technical details as
possible as short abstracts also tend to get low score due to
insufficient information.

-------------------------
Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected. The Abstract should
clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail and merely
mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the research
