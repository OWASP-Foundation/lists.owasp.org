<PRE>Hi Austin OWASPers, *
*

This month we have 2 really great events.  First, our Happy Hour is
happening at 5:00pm at Sherlocks.  We are cosponsoring this with ISSA and
ISACA.  Come on out and enjoy some beverages from VMWare (they are handing
out drink tickets, so be early!) and some door prizes.


Our second event is happening on June 30th from 3:30 to 5:00pm.  This our
traditional OWASP monthly meeting at an all new time!  Also, this event
looks to be really great and Travis has cooked up a great talk for us.

See you there!
