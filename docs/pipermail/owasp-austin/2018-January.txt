Happy New Year, everyone!


Our first OWASP Austin Chapter monthly meeting of the new year will be
three weeks from today, on Tuesday, *January 23*, 2018.  *NOTE: The date
for this meeting is earlier than usual*, due to room scheduling conflict;
for future months we will be back to the last Tuesday of the month.

can be sure to order enough food for everyone.


*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for January*

When: Tuesday, January 23rd @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Title: *CryptoParty*


In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to
communicate and associate without fear.


To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need
peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions. CryptoParties provide the
opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all
the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online.
Topics include technologies for securing your chats, your phone calls, your
e-mails, and your computer documents.


The Austin Chapter of the OWASP Foundation invites you to join us for our
CryptoParty where you will learn the tools and techniques to keep you safe
from prying eyes.


*Speaker: *Josh Sokol


*Food: *Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have
enough for all!

Hey Austin OWASPers!

In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'
where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without
privelege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or
station of birth.  We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may
express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being
coerced into silence or conformity."  The Internet of today is an amazing
place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr.
Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars.  We must be free to
to communicate and associate without fear.  To realize our right to privacy
and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.
CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these
solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to
privacy and anonymity online.  Topics include technologies like TOR,
full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more.  CryptoParties are free to
attend, public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 23, 2018 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first ever
CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about
the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy.
When the time comes, we will encourage you all to invite your family,
friends, and peers to attend this event, but for now, I am looking for
others who are willing to give a 10 minute max presentation on a
crypto-oriented subject.  The presentation will need to be laid out so that
novice and experienced alike can take action based on the data presented.
All tools must be free and open source.  If you are interested in
presenting, please e-mail me directly (do not reply to the list) with your
name, bio, talk title, and abstract for consideration.  This is going to be
EPIC!
