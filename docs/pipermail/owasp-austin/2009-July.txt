Had a good time doing the talk yesterday.

For those who couldn't make it or couldn't absorb all of the talk, I
have placed a copy here:

http://www.subspacefield.org/security/web_20_crypto.pdf

And if you're interested, my other talks and some projects are in the
same subdir:

http://www.subspacefield.org/security/

Also, I stumbled across this talk while working on my presentation:

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5187022592682372937

I think you'll find that we cover similar issues, and if any topics
were unclear in one talk the other talk might clear it up.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Usenix (security) conference proceedings free online
Message-ID: <20090728223631.GJ6196@subspacefield.org>

James asked me to send this but I thought it might be of general interest.

Apart from DEFCON, USENIX runs some of the most interesting conferences
I've been to.  In particular, I really liked USENIX Security, but now
they have a variety of conferences on security; the Workshop on Offensive
Technologies (WOOT) has some excellent papers and there's another one,
the Workshop on Large-scale Exploits and Emergent Threats (LEET) that
looks good too.

Here's the best part; all of their proceedings are immediately available
online, for free:

http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/

Happy reading...

Yep, sorry.  I wasn't paying attention and let my domain name expire!
Then there were delays in getting it again.

Fortunately it didn't get snatched.

Kinda embarrassing. :)

Should be back up:
http://www.subspacefield.org/security/web_20_crypto.pdf

Could someone link to it from the OWASP Austin site?
