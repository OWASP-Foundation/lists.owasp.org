After months of trying to get Rapid7 on board for our Penetration Testing 
with Metasploit Half-Day Seminar, it looks like they've decided that the 
idea was good enough to run with it on their own.  So for anyone who 
didn't make it out to the training for whatever reason, here's an 
excellent opportunity for you to hear about Metasploit for free.  It's 
next week (7/13) and seating is very limited so act fast if you're 
interested.

As a side note, we're working with Raphael Mudge to potentially offer a 
full-day Advanced Penetration Testing with Metasploit course the day 
before LASCON (10/27).  It unfortunately wouldn't be free as we'd have to 
pay for the conference center facilities and Raphael's expenses, but it 
should be cheap.  Let me know if you're available on that day and would be 
interested in attending for probably ~$200.

Hey Josh,

I am 1000% in on the full-day with Raphael before LASCON.  Even if I can't get my company to pay for it, I'm in ... sounds like pure gold in terms of security training.

You know, I probably don't say this enough, but thanks for bringing these types of events to our community--you rock!  I'm always telling my security buddies who aren't in Austin about how good the sessions are here, and it's because of your dedication and effort that we get such good sessions.  So thanks a lot man, take a minute to pat yourself (and James and Ben too) on the back!!

Thanks:)

you should definitely plan on coming.  Huge thanks to Blue Coat Systems

Subject: [Owasp-austin] No July OWASP Meeting - Attend TRISC Instead!
Message-ID: <OF711A2D62.C6FD85DC-ON862578CE.005B441D-862578CE.005C077C@ni.com>

Since the date of TRISC conflicts with when we would normally be doing the 
July OWASP meeting, we have decided to go ahead and cancel the OWASP 
meeting.  The good news is that instead of the hour of security that you 
would get at OWASP, you get over two days of content at TRISC.  I've 
negotiated with TRISC to become a sponsor of this year's conference so 
that all of you can attend the conference at a discounted rate.  Just tell 
them that you're an Austin OWASP members when you sign up to receive the 
discounted price.

The early-bird pricing discount has now ended, but TRISC has something new 
for you.  Now if you register two people for TRISC, you save $200!  You 
remember that security conscious friend of yours who you forgot to get a 
birthday present?  Why not use this deal to register them for TRISC as 
well and save?!?!  TRISC is July 24-26 at the Airport Hilton here in 
Austin.  They've got some terrific keynote speakers and you can even come 
and see me, Wickett, and even David Hughes talk about stuff.  For more 
information, check out http://www.trisc.org.  See you there!

Fellow OWASPers,

Hopefully by now you've heard the buzz around last year's Lonestar 
Application Security Conference (LASCON).  The conference was hosted by 
the Austin OWASP Chapter and featured some of the world's top security 
researchers including Robert "RSnake" Hansen, Samy Kamkar, Joe Jarzombek, 
and many more.  In it's first year, LASCON had over 160 attendees and the 
feedback was outstanding.  Here's just a few of examples of what 2010 
LASCON attendees had to say about the conference:
With the lineup of presenters that you have for the LASCON Conference, I 
can't afford not to go. 
- Ian Robertson 

Just wanted to drop the LASCON organizers a note about how much I enjoyed 
the conference last Friday. Good venue, good food, good presentations, and 
good people. 
- Joel Burrow 

Thanks for understanding how us geeks think and putting on a conference 
that we can really enjoy being a part of. 
- Jay Paz 

With so much positive feedback coming out of LASCON 2010 it was a no 
brainer for our team to do it again this year.  We've already received 
commitments from Jeremiah Grossman, John Steven, Michael Howard, and many 
more.  Needless to say, this year's conference is gonna rock and we want 
you to be a part of it!  We've got special Early-Bird Pricing good through 
the end of July.  For the next two weeks OWASP members can attend LASCON 
for only $75.  Non-members can attend LASCON for $125 and that includes a 
$50 OWASP membership of which 40% goes to support your local chapter.  You 
may have missed out on last year's conference, but you won't want to miss 
what we have in store for LASCON 2011 happening October 28, 2011 at the 
Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX.  And be sure to plan on sticking 
around for the LASCON Happy Hour sponsored by Trustwave.  The mechanical 
bull is back!  We'll see you at LASCON!

OWASPers,

I just wanted to remind you all that the Lonestar Application Security 
Conference (LASCON) Early-Bird registration rate ends on Sunday. Currently 
you can register to attend LASCON for only $75 as an OWASP member or $125 
for a non-member which includes a year membership ($50 value).  However, 
as of Monday, August 1st, the price goes up by $50.  If you're planning on 
attending LASCON, now is the time to register before the price goes up. 

LASCON is going down on October 28, 2011 at the Norris Conference Center 
in Austin, TX.  This year we will have four to five tracks with topics 
including Audit, Architecture, Development, and Executive Management. 
That's right, bring your boss to LASCON!  The CFP for LASCON is still open 
(submissions welcome), but speakers include Jeremiah Grossman, John 
Steven, Rafal Los, Michael Howard, Joe Jarzombek, and many more.  We have 
a happy hour event immediately after the conference sponsored by Trustwave 
and the mechanical bull will be back.  We're looking forward to seeing you 
at LASCON!

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Upcoming OWASP Board Member Elections
Message-ID: <OF07B580AA.3E460BE9-ON862578DC.00559B3F-862578DC.0055FDAB@ni.com>

The OWASP board election is around the corner.  If you have paid your 
membership fee before 30-June-2011, or if you are a qualified honorary 
member, then you are eligible to vote.  You should have received a 
confirmation email notifying you that you are eligible to vote in the 
election.  Click here to find out who is running, how to vote and your 
membership status.  If you have additional questions about the membership 
then please read the FAQ by clicking here.

As an aside, if you are an OWASP member, you are also eligible to request 
an @owasp.org e-mail address.  Here is a link to that form if you are 
interested:
