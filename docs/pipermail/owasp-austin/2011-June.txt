Hello Austin OWASPers!

Hopefully you all enjoyed James Flom's presentation on "Why Ha.ckers.org 
Doesn't Get Hacked".  I thought it was pretty awesome to see the work that 
they've put into making their systems secure.  In case you weren't able to 
make it or would like a copy of the presentation to reference later on, 
I've received permission from James to post it on the Austin OWASP website 
in the Presentation Archives (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin#tab=Presentation_Archives).

We began our first session of the OWASP WebGoat Study Group yesterday with 
a TON of people in attendance.  The table couldn't even fit everyone which 
is fantastic!  Ben gave us all an overview of some HTTP Basics and we 
talked about HTTP Response Splitting as well.  Fun stuff.  If you're 
interested in finding out more about the study group happening every 
Wednesday from 12-1 PM, please check out the "Austin OWASP Study Group" 
group on http://my.owasp.org.

It looks like the Penetration Testing with Metasploit Half-Day Seminar on 
June 17, 2011 was a big hit.  So much so that all 76 of the seats have 
been reserved and we even have over a dozen people on the waiting list. If 
you got a seat, congratulations, it was undoubtedly one of the hottest 
tickets in town and you won't be disappointed.  If you didn't, I've got 
good news for you.  If everything works out as planned, the OWASP 
Foundation will be sending us a couple of video cameras to use for this 
training.  The video will eventually get put online for everyone to be 
able to learn from.  Also, because of the tremendous success of this first 
event, we will look into doing similar types of events in the future.  If 
you have ideas on topics that you would like to see, please post them in 
the forums for the "Austin OWASP" group on http://my.owasp.org.

Even if you didn't get a ticket to attend the half-day, we still want you 
to come to the Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour from 5 - 7 PM over 
at Sherlocks afterward.  The event is sponsored by Rapid7, the current 
owner of Metasploit and I'm pretty sure that Raphael Mudge will be hanging 
out there with us.  If you plan on attending, we'd appreciate it if you'd 
RSVP at http://www.eventbrite.com/s/4wXb.  Thank you!

Sincerely,

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Looking for LASCON Speakers (10/28/2011)
Message-ID: <OF1CB0B398.502CDB8A-ON862578A9.00582AB8-862578A9.00597588@ni.com>

Hey Austin OWASPers!

Speak at LASCON
Just a quick note that we are still looking for CFP submissions for the 
2011 Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON).  This year we are 
specifically looking for people to speak on topics including Auditing, 
Architecture, Development, Executive Management, OWASP, and various 
security tools.  If you have expertise on any of these topics, we'd love 
to see a submission from you.  The direct link for LASCON CFP submissions 
is:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011

Everyone who speaks at LASCON gets a FREE pass to the conference, a 
limited-edition speakers only T-shirt, and a gift certificate for the 
OWASP store at the conference.  It's an excellent way to get your name out 
there and give back to the security community at the same time.  The 
submission deadline for LASCON CFP's is July 15th.

Attend LASCON
If you're not interested in speaking at LASCON, you should definitely plan 
on attending on October 28, 2011.  We've already received commitments from 
some of the industry's top security professionals.  Jeremiah Grossman, Joe 
Jarzombek, and John Steven are just a handful of the names that will be 
presenting at LASCON this year.  Registration is only $75 for OWASP 
members and $125 for non-members ($50 membership included) through July 
31.  After that date the prices will go up another $50.  To register, go 
to:

https://www.regonline.com/lascon2011

No other conference gives you more bang for your buck than LASCON. 
Register today and save on talks from the security industry's top 
presenters and this year's best networking opportunity.  And please plan 
to stick around for the Happy Hour afterward sponsored by Trustwave.  The 
mechanical bull is back!

Sincerely,

Austin OWASPers,

Just a reminder about tomorrow's Penetration Testing with Metasploit 
Half-Day Seminar  and Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour.  The 
seminar is sold-out, but if you're on the waiting list, please feel free 
to show up to the event anyway.  If anyone does not show up to claim their 
seat, we will attempt to fill those slots with somebody on the waiting 
list.  If you didn't get registered in time and aren't on the waiting 
list, we would still love for you to join us at the Austin Security 
Professionals Happy Hour from 5-7 PM over at Sherlock's.  As always, there 
will be free food and drinks courtesy of our sponsor Rapid7.  As an added 
bonus, Rapid7 will be giving away an iPad to one lucky drawing winner. You 
must be present to win so come on out and hang out with us Friday night at 
Sherlocks!  Please RSVP at http://www.eventbrite.com/s/4wXb.  See you 
there!

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Introduction to the OWASP Secure Coding Practices
 Quick Reference Guide - Austin OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <OFA5CCA505.CE0C109F-ON862578B9.005C8ED5-862578B9.005DA2D8@ni.com>

Attention!  Lunch for the June Austin OWASP meeting will be sponsored by 
LASCON!  Please RSVP!

When: June 28, 2011, 11:30am - 1:00pm 
Topic: Introduction to the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference 
Guide

The OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide is a technology 
agnostic set of general software security coding practices, in a 
comprehensive checklist format, that can be integrated into the 
development life-cycle. At only 17 pages long, it is easy to read and 
digest.
The focus is on secure coding requirements, rather than on vulnerabilities 
and exploits. In this respect it is targeted more precisely for the 
development community, as opposed to the security community. 
This presentation will introduce this OWASP project and discuss some of 
the core concepts and principles of the requirements.
Who: Keith Turpin (Boeing) 

Keith leads Boeing?s enterprise application security assessment team. He 
previously served as the lead IT security advisor for all of Boeing?s 
international operations. 
Keith represents Boeing on the International Committee for Information 
Technology Standard's cyber security technical committee and serves as a 
U.S. delegate to the International Standards Organization's sub-committee 
on cyber security.
Keith is the project leader for the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick 
Reference Guide and is a member of the OWASP Global Projects Committee. He 
also spent four years as the Director of Communication for the Seattle 
chapter of the Information Systems Security Association.  
He is a frequent speaker at conferences, professional organizations and 
corporations on a variety of security topics.   
Keith holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering and MS in Computer Systems.
Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building C which is the 
tallest building on campus (8 levels). There will be signs posted in the 
lobby to direct you where to go and the receptionists will be able to 
assist you as well. See directions to National Instruments. 
Cost: Always Free

A couple of interesting job opportunities have come across my e-mail 
lately if anyone is interested:

1) Atsec information security is looking to hire an experienced 
information security professional for a full time application security 
evaluation position.  I'm not sure what all that entails, but if it sounds 
interesting you should contact Auston Hold at holt at austonhold.com.

2) Zeb Blalock contacted me about an opportunity with Amazon in Seattle 
for a Senior Security Engineer focusing on application security.  If you 
enjoy analyzing the security of applications and services, discovering and 
addressing security issues and quickly reacting to new threat scenarios, 
this position would provide you with a challenging opportunity.  You would 
participate in security audits, risk analysis, vulnerability testing and 
security reviews across all elements of Amazon.com's software systems.  If 
this sounds interesting to you, then you can contact Zeb at (206) 266-9846 
or zebb at amazon.com to find out more information.

Hope you all enjoyed today's OWASP meeting.  I counted 57 people there. 
Sorry we ran out of food, but we had far less than that RSVP and haven't 
run out with those numbers in the past.  I'll order more for next time. 
Take care!

Hey Austin OWASPers,

An important announcement from TRISC.  They've extended early-bird 
registration through July 8.  As I announced at yesterday's meeting, there 
will be no July OWASP meeting and I instead strongly encourage you all to 
take advantage of TRISC.  Wanna know a secret?

[BEGIN SECRET]

Shhhh....If you're not an OWASP member yet go to http://www.lascon.org and 
register today for LASCON for only $125.  That includes a $50 OWASP 
membership.  Then go to http://www.trisc.org and register for TRISC as an 
OWASP member.  Bam!  You're now an official OWASP member, can vote in the 
upcoming OWASP board elections (if you are a member by tomorrow), and you 
get an extra $100 off of your TRISC registration!  But you didn't hear it 
from me....

[/END SECRET]

IMPORTANT UPDATES::  Discount registration is extended through Friday, 
July
8, and expanded to include Students, Military, and Government employees.
Joe Jarzumbek, Director for Software Assurance with the Department of

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Secure Tacos
Message-ID: <OFE055FF26.2938FC09-ON862578BE.0075BEA2-862578BE.00768F1F@ni.com>

Over the last year and a half we've done a lot with Austin OWASP to try 
and do more with and for the security community in addition to the monthly 
meetings.  We now have regular happy hours, weekly study groups, a free 
half-day seminar, and a kickass conference.  A co-worker gave me an idea 
today and in an effort to commit myself to even more security fun, I 
wanted to throw it out to you all to see if it interests people.

I'm going to tentatively call the idea "Secure Tacos" because it combines 
my passion for security with my love for the Don Juan breakfast taco at 
Juan in a Million (http://www.juaninamillion.com).  Basically, it could be 
weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or whatever, but we'd meet on a fairly regular 
basis in the morning for breakfast and to talk about the latest news in 
security.  You know, whatever the hot topic for the week is.  Anonymous, 
0-day, acquisitions, cool tools....anything security related.  We'd do it 
in the morning at say 8 AM and it'd only last an hour or so.  Good idea? 
Bad idea?  Let me know if you're interested.

Sincerely,

I would be down. Bi-weekly or monthly probably makes the most sense.

I think it makes sense to have a north and south one for this type of event.

Yes, it's maybe 1-2 miles east of 35 on Cesar Chavez.  5 minutes from 
downtown.  And yes, it is the place that was on Man vs Food though that 
guy is a chump.  The current women's record holder at Juan in a Million 
ate just as many Don Juan tacos as he did.  Food 1, Man 0.

Isn't juan in a million central/downtown? This is the joint that was on 
man vs food wasn't it? A bit of a compromise for those folks that are 
north and south, but everyone gets to fight the traffic equally ;). I 
think if you split this idea across multiple locations you wont get as 
much traction. So I'm in for some juan in a million.

Rich,
 
I completely understand what you're saying.  And I would love to have 
secure breakfasts all over town.  I chose Juan in a Million because, 
frankly, I'll be there anyway and it is on my way into the office in the 
morning.  My suggestion, in true OWASP form, is that if you would like to 
host Secure Pancakes at the IHOP in Round Rock or Secure Eggs Mexicana at 
the Taco Cabana wherever, let's do it.  I probably won't be there, but 
anything that we can do to have fun while raising awareness about security 
is a good thing.  
 
The same goes for anyone else on this list.  If you have an idea to do 
something that gets people involved with security in our community, I'm 
all for it.  It only takes a leader and an idea to make it happen.
