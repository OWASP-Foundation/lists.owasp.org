<PRE>Hello everyone!



The *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *for February is coming up *next
week*, Thursday, February 8th.  Sorry for the later notice, but with
Sherlock's Baker Street Pub closing, we needed to explore other venues.  We
decided to try out Baby A's on Stonelake Blvd in North Austin, and will see
how well that works out.


Our sponsor will be *RSA*.  Here are the details:


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for February*

*When:* Thursday, February 8th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where:* ****NEW LOCATION!**** Baby A's, 9505-B Stonelake Blvd, Austin,
Texas 78759 (corner of Stonelake and York Blvd, between Hwy 183 and
Mopac).  We will meet in the area inside the restaurant, in the far left
corner.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.
