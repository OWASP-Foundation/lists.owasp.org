<PRE>Hello folks!


Our OWASP Austin Chapter monthly meeting for February is coming up in a few
weeks, on Tuesday, February 27, 2018.


Please be sure to register on Eventbrite by Friday, (2/23/2018) so that we
can be sure to order enough food for everyone.


*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for February*

When: Tuesday, February 27th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Title: *Results from our latest research on DevSecOps*


There is a confluence of forces that disrupt the ability for organizations
to implement DevSecOps effectively. We continue to increase our dependence
on software but teams are still relatively immature in developing securely.
Our systems continue to grow exponentially complex. With IoT starting to
take off, there is no clear industry vision for security these devices.
Cybersecurity threats continue to rise. Even the most diligent teams find
themselves subtly gaining technical debt because they are unable to do the
job right.



This impact is felt across industries: telecommunications, financial,
software development, transportation, and medical just to name a few. So
what is our response as security professionals? We have software tools and
databases like OWASP Top 10, CWE/CVE, SANS Top 25 and so on. But what we
need is a set of patterns and anti-patterns on implementing DevSecOps.



Our talk will highlight what we&#8217;ve observed in conducting research from
Tier 1 peer reviewed articles from 2016 to the present. We will present
what seems to be emerging as a set of best practices as well as
anti-patterns in DevSecOps.


*Speaker: *Altaz Valani


Altaz Valani is the Director of Research at Security Compass responsible
for managing the overall research vision and team.  Prior to joining
Security Compass, Altaz was a Senior Research Director in the Application
Development Practice at Info-Tech Research Group providing IT managers,
directors, and senior managers with guidance and analysis around
application development, application rationalization, agile, cloud, mobile,
and the SDLC.  His other past positions include Senior Manager at KPMG, and
various positions where he worked side by side with senior-level
stakeholders to drive business value through software development.


*Food: *Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have
enough for all!
