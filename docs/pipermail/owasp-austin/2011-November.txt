Austin OWASPers,

With our Austin OWASP events having wound down for the rest of the year, I 
wanted to share with you something else that I think is a cool opportunity 
to interact with local code monkeys, css ninjas, HTML pirates, project 
management gurus, design afficianados, etc while doing something for a 
great cause.  The organization is called Random Hacks of Kindness (
http://www.rhok.org) and their mission is to make the world a better place 
through a global community of innovation developing practical open 
technology.  There have been 3 global events to date in 31 cities around 
the globe with over 3000 participants.  During their last event in June 
2011, over 120 problems were addressed by 110 technology solutions that 
have been used by organizations such as the World bank, governments, 
emergency responders, and citizens.  The next event in Austin (
http://www.rhok.org/event/austin-tx-usa) will be held Friday, December 2nd 
- Sunday, December 4th.  You don't need to commit to the whole time and 
they have a number of problems available already to choose from (
http://www.rhok.org/problems).  If you like building software, have a 
passion for social change, or just like hanging around people who do, then 
this is the place for you.

On another note, we have already begun our planning for Austin OWASP 2012, 
but there's still plenty of room to get involved.  Whether you're 
interesting in helping to plan and run meetings, decide on speakers, or 
volunteer for LASCON, now is the time to let us know.  We have a number of 
things going on this next year that will require even more volunteer 
assistance so there's never been a better time than now to get involved. 
If you're interested, please let me know.

Finally, I've had a number of people contact me about job offerings in the 
InfoSec space.  The details on these are below for those who may be 
interested.
