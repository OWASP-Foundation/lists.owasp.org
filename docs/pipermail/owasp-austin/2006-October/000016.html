<PRE>
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community
dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain
applications that can be trusted. We advocate approaching application
security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most
effective approaches to application security includes improvements in all
of these areas.

Each month during our chapter meeting, a subject matter expert will present
and discuss one of the OWASP top 10 topics. OWASP chapter meetings are free
and open to anyone interested in application security.

Topic: Web Application Threat Modeling:  How to Understand How Attackers
will Attempt to Exploit your App
Presenter: Cap Diebel and John Dickson of Denim Group, Ltd.


Abstract:
The term &quot;threat modeling&quot; has become quite popular recently. Microsoft has
published a book about their process and includes threat modeling as a key
activity in their Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL).


A threat model is essentially a structured representation of all the
information that affects the security of an application. In essence, it is
a view of the application and its environment through security glasses.


Threat modeling is a process for capturing, organizing, and analyzing all
of this information. Threat modeling enables informed decision-making about
application security risk. In addition to producing a model, typical threat
modeling efforts also produce a prioritized list of security improvements
to the concept, requirements, design, or implementation.


Denim Group will present an overview on the process of making web
applications more secure by identifying attack vectors and designing to
defeat those attacks.  They will provide an overview of threat modeling,
provide examples of how it is relevant to the development process, and will
introduce you to tools and approaches that will enable you to successfully
implement threat modeling techniques within your organizations.





Presenter Bio:
Cap Diebel is a developer and security consultant for Denim Group and has
extensive experience identifying vulnerabilities in web applications.  John
Dickson is a CISSP and is a Principal at Denim Group and works with clients
to quantify the business risk associated that web applications represent.
