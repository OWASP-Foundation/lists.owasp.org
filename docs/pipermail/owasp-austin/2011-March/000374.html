<PRE>IMHO, OWASP is for everyone.  As our local chapter President, I've strived 
to find presentations that are as entertaining to auditors as they are 
developers.  Certainly not an easy thing to accomplish, but I think we've 
struck a good balance.

The notion that &quot;Developers don't know &lt;expletive deleted&gt; about security&quot; 
is false on so many levels as are most generalizations.  Developers learn 
what they are taught in school, what they garner through experience, and 
what they seek out on their own.  As OWASP, it is our job to not only be 
the place developers feel comfortable seeking out, but to also help to 
evangelize security within the community and get developers more 
interested.  Messages like the one above, as Rich said, are divisive at 
best and undermine OWASP's core mission of educating the masses on 
security.

I'd like to put this out there for everyone in our Austin OWASP community. 
 Build bridges, not walls.  Make the developers your friends.  Put 
yourself in the trenches with them and hold regular office hours.  Show 
enthusiasm and let them know that security is FUN.  Remember that people 
are motivated by the things *they* want to do, not the things you want 
them to do.

If you haven't done so already, read &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence 
People&quot; by Dale Carnegie.  It completely changed the way I view my 
interactions with people and I believe I've been a better security 
professional because of it.  That's my $0.02, but real change has to come 
from within.  ;-)

Great articles. When there is an OWASP meeting that deals with the social 
engineering necessary to bridge the gap between security people and 
developers I'll be there to represent the developers.

I think one interesting thing about both links is they accept the idea of 
a &quot;security person.&quot; Two blog entries and a series of comments where the 
division is just accepted...

It seems to accept developers aren't &quot;security people,&quot; which is largely 
true.  But the same could be said of managers, network engineers and many 
others who haven't been educated specifically on security - or put it into 
practice. Even building architects and construction teams don't always 
know the basics of some physical security. So, who is a security person?

A little speculation, but usually when there's an &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; 
discussion, it probably means there's not a lot of &quot;them&quot; in the room. 
That might be the problem for the larger OWASP community or the conference 
environment this question came up in.

Hey everyone,

I have been catching up on OWASP reading and was wondering what you think 
of these articles concerning engagement with developers?

I send these not to get you worried about the future of OWASP, but more 
for the Austin chapter to engage our localized development communities 
(Ruby, ACUG, Python, ...).  We should use these articles as motivation to 
drive our vision for the Austin chapter of OWASP.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
James
