<PRE>Great discussion!  I believe &#145;security&#146;, in some form, belongs throughout
the SDLC.  When I wrote milspec avionics code in the &#145;80s we were required
to incorporate input validation into every function and design test cases
that exercised its limits.  Didn&#146;t worry much about confidentiality, but
availability was critical because satellites are not iphones you can just
reboot.  Anyway, I took part in some great discussions at B-Sides and here&#146;s
another forum that will be interesting.

<A HREF="https://www.isc2.org/EventDetails.aspx?id=7326">https://www.isc2.org/EventDetails.aspx?id=7326</A>     It will be downtown at
the Marriott on 4th Street.

SecureSDLC - Austin

An (ISC)&#178; Security Leadership Series
Tuesday, June 14, 2011

Member = FREE, Non-member = $99

Conference Highlights:

The  &lt;<A HREF="https://www.isc2.org/gisws2011/Default.aspx">https://www.isc2.org/gisws2011/Default.aspx</A>&gt; (ISC)&#178; 2011 Global
Information Security Workforce Study ranked application vulnerabilities as
the number one  threat to information security professionals.  This
validates the critical need for building security throughout the entire
software lifecycle.

(ISC)&#178; SecureSDLC  events arm software professionals with the latest tools
and information regarding application security.  It will address building
security in from the ground up, tackle what to consider when securing each
phase of the software lifecycle, and investigate how companies can create
their own software assurance program.

Software stakeholders will learn why application security is important to
not only the development team but the business as well because it could help
enhance organizations credibility and reduce the loss of revenue and
reputation due to a breach resulting from insecure software.  Attendees will
learn best practices and industry standards for how security should be built
into each phase.

Target Audience:

Attendees would be individuals that are involved in software development who
design, code, build, deploy and manage software. This would include software
stakeholders including software developers, project managers, architects,
programmers, and others involved in the software development lifecycle.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-austin] OWASP's engagement with developers in Austin

 

I'm really enjoying this conversation. The articles James used to start it
are great, especially since I've been closed up in my own little world for a
while and didn't really know what was going on in the OWASP community. I
also think the points made by each of the responses in this thread are solid
and have made me think about how we can all work together, especially in
Austin.

 

I think this issue that the OWASP community as a whole is dealing with is a
perpetual challenge and an important one for the InfoSec community at large.
In communicating the value of security and my services to customers in the
past, I've fallen into the trap of assuming I know the business or the work
or the software better than my target audience. Even if I did know more, the
lack of respect and humility in my language disconnected my audience
immediately. I became a critic at best and an adversary at worst, when what
I really wanted was to work together to build a shared vision and accomplish
a shared goal. I hope that I've grown from those experiences. Now, I'm
trying hard to craft my leadership in a style described thousands of years
ago... &quot;A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is
done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.&quot; - Lao Tzu

I'll second what Josh says above.

 

I've been too crazy busy to mention this before but I'm working on a
presentation with a developer friend to give at Agile Austin.  This from the
guy who heads one of the bigger breaker projects at OWASP.  And don't forget
QA people.  That's a huge audience and I've found QA people _very_ receptive
to information on security testing.

 

The truth is we have to engage developers, QA, other security professionals
and management if we're going to make this a better place for us and the
next generation like my kids.  We collectively setup the Internet as it is
today and its up to us to collectively mold it into the great and secure
place it should be.

 

And I think OWASP is the right place to bring all those parties together.

 

Cheers!

IMHO, OWASP is for everyone.  As our local chapter President, I've strived
to find presentations that are as entertaining to auditors as they are
developers.  Certainly not an easy thing to accomplish, but I think we've
struck a good balance. 

The notion that &quot;Developers don't know &lt;expletive deleted&gt; about security&quot;
is false on so many levels as are most generalizations.  Developers learn
what they are taught in school, what they garner through experience, and
what they seek out on their own.  As OWASP, it is our job to not only be the
place developers feel comfortable seeking out, but to also help to
evangelize security within the community and get developers more interested.
Messages like the one above, as Rich said, are divisive at best and
undermine OWASP's core mission of educating the masses on security. 

I'd like to put this out there for everyone in our Austin OWASP community.
Build bridges, not walls.  Make the developers your friends.  Put yourself
in the trenches with them and hold regular office hours.  Show enthusiasm
and let them know that security is FUN.  Remember that people are motivated
by the things *they* want to do, not the things you want them to do. 

If you haven't done so already, read &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence
People&quot; by Dale Carnegie.  It completely changed the way I view my
interactions with people and I believe I've been a better security
professional because of it.  That's my $0.02, but real change has to come
from within.  ;-)

Great articles. When there is an OWASP meeting that deals with the social
engineering necessary to bridge the gap between security people and
developers I'll be there to represent the developers.  
;-)

2011/2/22 Rich V&#225;zquez &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">rich.vazquez at gmail.com</A>&gt; 
I think one interesting thing about both links is they accept the idea of a
&quot;security person.&quot; Two blog entries and a series of comments where the
division is just accepted... 

It seems to accept developers aren't &quot;security people,&quot; which is largely
true.  But the same could be said of managers, network engineers and many
others who haven't been educated specifically on security - or put it into
practice. Even building architects and construction teams don't always know
the basics of some physical security. So, who is a security person? 

A little speculation, but usually when there's an &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;
discussion, it probably means there's not a lot of &quot;them&quot; in the room. That
might be the problem for the larger OWASP community or the conference
environment this question came up in.

Hey everyone,

I have been catching up on OWASP reading and was wondering what you think of
these articles concerning engagement with developers?

I send these not to get you worried about the future of OWASP, but more for
the Austin chapter to engage our localized development communities (Ruby,
ACUG, Python, ...).  We should use these articles as motivation to drive our
vision for the Austin chapter of OWASP.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
James
