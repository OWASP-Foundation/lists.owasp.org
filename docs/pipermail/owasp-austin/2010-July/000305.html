<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers!

I wanted to take a moment to remind you of our OWASP meeting next Tuesday, 
July 27.  The topic is &quot;Data Attack Anatomy: Stopping Bad Guys &amp; 
Satisfying Auditors with Pragmatic Database Security&quot;.  In this session, 
John Marler, a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva, will discuss the 
challenges of data security requirements imposed by today's regulations, 
how organizations are achieving success and why organizations should do 
more than comply.  In addition to presenting, Imperva along with Futurecom 
have decided to sponsor lunch for the meeting.  I am not sure exactly what 
type of food it will be, but they assure me it will be something delicious 
so please bring your appetite.

Next up, ISSA has graciously offered up attendance to Austin OWASPers in 
their Birds of a Feather technical session on Incident Response Planning. 
The event will be happening on Tuesday, July 27 (the same day of the OWASP 
meeting) at 5:30 PM and features Peter Sullivan, visiting scientist from 
SEI (CERT).  The session will be held at St. Edwards University PEC (in 
the Echelon II building).  Cost is $10, seating is limited to the first 45 
attendees, and dinner is provided.  Please see 
<A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/763878782">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/763878782</A> for more information or to 
register.

Please make sure to mark your calendar for Thursday, August 12 from 5-7 PM 
for the next Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour.  The event will be 
held at Sherlock's (9012 Research Blvd) and we would like to sincerely 
thank WhiteHat Security for stepping up to sponsor it.  These events are 
extremely fun, feature free food and drinks, and you'll find no better 
opportunity to chat with 30+ of Austin's finest security professionals. 
See you there!

Last, but certainly not least, our chapter leaders are hard at work 
planning what will become the first-ever OWASP Regional Conference in 
Texas.  The Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) will be held 
on Friday, October 29, 2010 at the Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX. 
 We have a ton of opportunities for our members to get involved.  The Call 
for Papers is up and we are awaiting your submission to present at the 
conference along with the likes of Robert &quot;RSnake&quot; Hansen and Michael 
Howard.  If you work for a company that does work in the security 
industry, we have released a set of sponsor packages that are discounted 
through August 15th and are already selling like hotcakes.  Finally, we 
will be looking for both Conference Organizers and Functional Leaders 
(Descriptions available here) to assist us in planning and executing the 
conference.  Details on everything is available on the conference website 
and limited registration (only 200 attendees!) will be opening up very 
soon.  If you are interested in helping out with the conference and have 
not already talked to us about it, please e-mail James Wickett 
(<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">james.wickett at owasp.org</A>).
