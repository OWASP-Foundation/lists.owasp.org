<PRE>Hey Austin OWASPers,

Two things are different about this meeting than all other OWASP Meeting:

1. The meeting is in Building B (5-story) and not Building C (normal
meeting location).  There will be signs to direct you where to go and
my cell is listed at the bottom of this email if you need help finding
it.
2. This meeting includes lunch at no cost.

Feel free to RSVP on the Ning site, but it is not required to attend.

See you there!

See meeting info below.

--------------------------

Topic: Data Attack Anatomy: Stopping Bad Guys &amp; Satisfying Auditors
with Pragmatic Database Security

When: July 27, 2010, 11:30am - 1:00pm

Corporate databases and their contents are under siege. From outside
the organization, criminals can exploit web applications to steal
confidential information for financial gain. From the inside,
databases can be compromised by employees and contractors with
malicious intent. SQL Injection, platform vulnerabilities, buffer
overflows ... databases are vulnerable to a myriad of threats and
attack vectors.

In this session John Marler, a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva,
will discuss the challenges of data security requirements imposed by
today&#8217;s regulations, how organizations are achieving success and why
organizations should do more than comply.

Who: John Marler (Imperva)

John is a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva and has a decade of
experience in designing, deploying and managing large infrastructure
and network security solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises. After
seven years with Dell IT, John moved into a network security
consulting role for an IBM partner and went on to evangelize network
security consolidation and simplification with Crossbeam Systems.
Currently he is a senior security engineer with Imperva and
specializes in web application and database security.

John is a graduate of Texas A&amp;M University with a BBA in Information
and Operations Management and holds multiple industry certs including
Cisco networking &amp; design specializations, CheckPoint firewall, and
TippingPoint IPS.

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building B which is the
5-story building on campus. There will be signs posted in the lobby to
direct you where to go and the receptionists will be able to assist
you as well. See directions to National Instruments.

Cost: Always Free

Questions or help with Directions... call: James Wickett (512) 964-6227.

RSVP on the Austin OWASP Ning Site
