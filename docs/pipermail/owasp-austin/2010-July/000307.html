When: July 27, 2010, 11:30am - 1:00pm


Topic: Data Attack Anatomy: Stopping Bad Guys &amp; Satisfying Auditors with
Pragmatic Database Security

Corporate databases and their contents are under siege. From outside the
organization, criminals can exploit web applications to steal confidential
information for financial gain. From the inside, databases can be
compromised by employees and contractors with malicious intent. SQL
Injection, platform vulnerabilities, buffer overflows ... databases are
vulnerable to a myriad of threats and attack vectors.


In this session John Marler, a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva, will
discuss the challenges of data security requirements imposed by today&#8217;s
regulations, how organizations are achieving success and why organizations
should do more than comply.

Who: John Marler (Imperva)


John is a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva and has a decade of
experience in designing, deploying and managing large infrastructure and
network security solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises. After seven years
with Dell IT, John moved into a network security consulting role for an IBM
partner and went on to evangelize network security consolidation and
simplification with Crossbeam Systems. Currently he is a senior security
engineer with Imperva and specializes in web application and database
security.


John is a graduate of Texas A&amp;M University with a BBA in Information and
Operations Management and holds multiple industry certs including Cisco
networking &amp; design specializations, CheckPoint firewall, and TippingPoint
IPS.
