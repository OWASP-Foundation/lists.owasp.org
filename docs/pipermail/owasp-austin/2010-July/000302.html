  Topic: Data Attack Anatomy: Stopping Bad Guys &amp; Satisfying Auditors with  
  Pragmatic Database Security                                               
                                                                            
  Corporate databases and their contents are under siege. From outside the  
  organization, criminals can exploit web applications to steal             
  confidential information for financial gain. From the inside, databases   
  can be compromised by employees and contractors with malicious intent.    
  SQL Injection, platform vulnerabilities, buffer overflows ... databases   
  are vulnerable to a myriad of threats and attack vectors.                 
                                                                            
                                                                            
  In this session John Marler, a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva,     
  will discuss the challenges of data security requirements imposed by      
  today&#8217;s regulations, how organizations are achieving success and why      
  organizations should do more than comply.
