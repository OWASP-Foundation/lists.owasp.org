<PRE>Howdy Austin OWASPers!

Don't forget about the chapter meeting tomorrow!  A local luminary will be
speaking on Logging -- Michael Gough.

----
OWASP Austin September Chapter Meeting, September 29th
When: Tuesday, September 29th @ 11:45 - 1PM

Title: Log Everything, even if it is just on local disks

Logs are as important as SQLi, XSS or Secure Coding! OWASP has a &#8220;Logging
Cheat Sheet&#8221;, and there are the &#8220;Windows Logging Cheat Sheet&#8221;, &#8220;Windows
PowerShell Logging Cheat Sheet&#8221;, &#8220;Windows Splunk Logging Cheat Sheet&#8221; and
several other I created, but we still lack an understanding of logging when
it comes to Application Security and DevOps.

Enabling and configuration of logs must become as basic and a standard
practice as doing WebApp security scans, secure code reviews or secure
webapp design, which should include application log design and
implementation. You don&#8217;t need an expensive log management solution to do
good application security or DevOps log configuration. What we need is to
include all our Cheat Sheets into DevOps builds so enabling and
configuration is baked in and to include a log design review as a part of
our application secure reviews. So WHEN we need log data, it is there for
us.

Speaker: Michael Gough

Michael is the founder of &quot;Malware Archaeology&quot; and has 20 years experience
in IT and Information Security and currently in the Healthcare sector. In
the past Michael has been a consultant for HP and other consultancies, an
analyst for the Financial sector, Health Care and State of Texas. Michael
now focuses his talents as a Blue Team Defender, malwarian fighter and
malware archeologist, protecting his employer from nefarious
ne`er-do-wellers.

Michael also led BSides Texas with Michelle Klinger for 6 years and led the
BSides Austin conference held in March. Michael discovered the WinNTI
malware 10 months before Kasperski released their report. He also
discovered and exploited a major Card Key system flaw back in 2010 which
can be found on YouTube.

Michael is a creator of the Malware Management Framework, a process to help
discover malware on Windows based systems. Michael also developed the
&#8220;Windows Logging Cheat Sheet&#8221; to provide a starting point on detailed
logging for Windows hosts.

Michael's resources may be found on his website: MalwareArchaeology

Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C
