<PRE>For those of you interested in participating in the OWASP Study Group, this
is a follow-up message to let you know that we have decided on the book
titled &quot;*Snapshot - Reading and Treating People Right the First Time*&quot; by
Dan Korem. The book can only be purchased from the following online store
and only as hardcover (no electronic format). Cost of book is $34.95 retail.

   - Amazon -
   <A HREF="http://smile.amazon.com/Snapshot-Reading-Treating-People-Right/dp/098933581X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431191284&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dan+korem">http://smile.amazon.com/Snapshot-Reading-Treating-People-Right/dp/098933581X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431191284&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dan+korem</A>

The chapter will purchase books for those who participated in the last
study group and attended over 70% of the meetings.  A separate message will
be sent to those individuals.

We will use the
<A HREF="http://my.owasp.org/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-2015-snapshot">http://my.owasp.org/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-2015-snapshot</A>
discussion forum to share thoughts and have discussions on this book.
Please be sure to *sign up* for the site, *join* the OWASP Austin Study
Group, and *follow* the discussion forum so that you can get alerts on
posts to the forum.

As for the starting date, we have decided on *Thursday, October 1, 2015*.
We wanted to give more time to obtain the book, and not conflict with the
OWASP AppSecUSA date (week of 9/21).

Please let me know of any questions or concerns.

Looking forward to seeing you next month!

OWASP Austin Training/Study Coordinator

</I>&gt;<i> For those of you who have been involved or are interested in the study
</I>&gt;<i> group, I wanted to send a note saying that we do *not* have a topic this
</I>&gt;<i> week and thus are *not meeting tomorrow (Thursday, August 13).*  We do
</I>&gt;<i> have a topic scheduled for next week (August 20) on &quot;Security Analytics&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which will be presented by Josh Sokol. Thanks Josh!  See the Study Group's
</I>&gt;<i> discussion forum &quot;*Study Group - Individual Presentations (July/August
</I>&gt;<i> 2015) - CURRENT

</I>&gt;<i> for more details. This is the last one we have scheduled for our foray into
</I>&gt;<i> having individual presentations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is time to determine our next topic to cover in our study group.  One
</I>&gt;<i> book that was suggested was by Josh Sokol, which he posted on the Study
</I>&gt;<i> Group's discussion forum &quot;*Future Study Group Ideas (Ongoing Discussion
</I>&gt;<i> Forum)*

</I>&gt;<i> by Dan Korem, and as Josh pointed out in his post, it is a different topic
</I>&gt;<i> from others we have covered.  It focuses more on communication and
</I>&gt;<i> interactions with others. The more I think about it, the more I am
</I>&gt;<i> interested in this book, as it may very well help in our line of business
</I>&gt;<i> to improve communication with management on the importance of security.  So
</I>&gt;<i> I am suggesting that this book be our next topic, with a tentative start
</I>&gt;<i> date of September 10th.  I would like to get feedback on this suggestion,
</I>&gt;<i> so please provide your response to the Study Group site, in the &quot;*Future
</I>&gt;<i> Study Group Ideas (Ongoing Discussion Forum)*
