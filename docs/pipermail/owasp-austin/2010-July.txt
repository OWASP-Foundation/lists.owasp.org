  Corporate databases and their contents are under siege. From outside the  
  organization, criminals can exploit web applications to steal             
  confidential information for financial gain. From the inside, databases   
  can be compromised by employees and contractors with malicious intent.    
  SQL Injection, platform vulnerabilities, buffer overflows ... databases   
  are vulnerable to a myriad of threats and attack vectors.                 
                                                                            
                                                                            
  In this session John Marler, a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva,     
  will discuss the challenges of data security requirements imposed by      
  today?s regulations, how organizations are achieving success and why      
  organizations should do more than comply.

Satisfying Auditors with Pragmatic Database Security".  In this session, 
John Marler, a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva, will discuss the 
challenges of data security requirements imposed by today's regulations, 
how organizations are achieving success and why organizations should do 
more than comply.  In addition to presenting, Imperva along with Futurecom 
have decided to sponsor lunch for the meeting.  I am not sure exactly what 
type of food it will be, but they assure me it will be something delicious 
so please bring your appetite.

Next up, ISSA has graciously offered up attendance to Austin OWASPers in 
their Birds of a Feather technical session on Incident Response Planning. 
The event will be happening on Tuesday, July 27 (the same day of the OWASP 
meeting) at 5:30 PM and features Peter Sullivan, visiting scientist from 
SEI (CERT).  The session will be held at St. Edwards University PEC (in 
the Echelon II building).  Cost is $10, seating is limited to the first 45 
attendees, and dinner is provided.  Please see 
http://www.eventbrite.com/event/763878782 for more information or to 
register.

Please make sure to mark your calendar for Thursday, August 12 from 5-7 PM 
for the next Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour.  The event will be 
held at Sherlock's (9012 Research Blvd) and we would like to sincerely 
thank WhiteHat Security for stepping up to sponsor it.  These events are 
extremely fun, feature free food and drinks, and you'll find no better 
opportunity to chat with 30+ of Austin's finest security professionals. 
See you there!

Last, but certainly not least, our chapter leaders are hard at work 
planning what will become the first-ever OWASP Regional Conference in 
Texas.  The Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) will be held 
on Friday, October 29, 2010 at the Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX. 
 We have a ton of opportunities for our members to get involved.  The Call 
for Papers is up and we are awaiting your submission to present at the 
conference along with the likes of Robert "RSnake" Hansen and Michael 
Howard.  If you work for a company that does work in the security 
industry, we have released a set of sponsor packages that are discounted 
through August 15th and are already selling like hotcakes.  Finally, we 
will be looking for both Conference Organizers and Functional Leaders 
(Descriptions available here) to assist us in planning and executing the 
conference.  Details on everything is available on the conference website 
and limited registration (only 200 attendees!) will be opening up very 
soon.  If you are interested in helping out with the conference and have 
not already talked to us about it, please e-mail James Wickett 
(james.wickett at owasp.org).

	National Instruments Building B - (Lunch included)
Message-ID: <AANLkTimuNf5SXyRfgAiAAw-W+=UFaJrVG_Km1AnCAHRW@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Austin OWASPers,

Two things are different about this meeting than all other OWASP Meeting:

1. The meeting is in Building B (5-story) and not Building C (normal
meeting location).  There will be signs to direct you where to go and
my cell is listed at the bottom of this email if you need help finding
it.
2. This meeting includes lunch at no cost.

Feel free to RSVP on the Ning site, but it is not required to attend.

See you there!

See meeting info below.

Topic: Data Attack Anatomy: Stopping Bad Guys & Satisfying Auditors
with Pragmatic Database Security

When: July 27, 2010, 11:30am - 1:00pm

Corporate databases and their contents are under siege. From outside
the organization, criminals can exploit web applications to steal
confidential information for financial gain. From the inside,
databases can be compromised by employees and contractors with
malicious intent. SQL Injection, platform vulnerabilities, buffer
overflows ... databases are vulnerable to a myriad of threats and
attack vectors.

In this session John Marler, a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva,
will discuss the challenges of data security requirements imposed by
today?s regulations, how organizations are achieving success and why
organizations should do more than comply.

Who: John Marler (Imperva)

John is a Senior Security Engineer with Imperva and has a decade of
experience in designing, deploying and managing large infrastructure
and network security solutions for Fortune 500 enterprises. After
seven years with Dell IT, John moved into a network security
consulting role for an IBM partner and went on to evangelize network
security consolidation and simplification with Crossbeam Systems.
Currently he is a senior security engineer with Imperva and
specializes in web application and database security.

John is a graduate of Texas A&M University with a BBA in Information
and Operations Management and holds multiple industry certs including
Cisco networking & design specializations, CheckPoint firewall, and
TippingPoint IPS.

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building B which is the
5-story building on campus. There will be signs posted in the lobby to
direct you where to go and the receptionists will be able to assist
you as well. See directions to National Instruments.

Cost: Always Free
