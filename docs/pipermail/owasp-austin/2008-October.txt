All,

While I've had experience with vulnerability scanners (Core, Nessus,
etc) I've never really looked into what's out there with regards to vuln
scanners that focus on Web Application Vulnerability scanning.  I'm
trying to compile a list of security tools that are "out there" and was
wondering what you all know about/use/recommend.  I have a pretty full
list of other tools, but my web app section is pretty lean. Any
thoughts? Could be open source, commercial, etc. 

Thanks

David H.

I am currently using WebInspect and have recently evaluated AppScan.
These two are considered the top two commercial tools for Web
Application vulnerability scanning. Both of them are expensive and have
some good features I like.

David,

Check out w3af (Web Application Attack and Audit Framework).  It was 
presented on at the OWASP AppSec NYC 2008 conference and I thought it was 
awesome.  It incorporates all of your typical Watchfire AppScan/Cenzic/SPI 
type of scanning with some very cool plugin features and even has exploit 
functionality similar to that of CoreImpact.  And it's an OWASP project!

David,

[tools]
For commercial Web App Scanners look at:
* IBM Rational AppScan (formerly Watchfire's product)
http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/appscan/
* HP WebInspect (formerly SPI Dynamics)
https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp?zn=bto&cp=1-11-201-200^9570_4000_100__

* Cynzic has recently added Web App Scanning to their products as well, 
though AppScan and WebInspect are the big players in the commercial world.
http://www.cenzic.com/products_services/index.php

I agree with Josh that w3af is a very nice tool - particularly the new 
GUI is _very_ nice.
(Planned to be on the Portugal release of the OWASP Live CD 2008)
http://w3af.sourceforge.net/

You should probably look at Grendal Scan too (Not OWASP but GPL'ed).
(Currently on the SoC release of the OWASP Live CD 2008)
http://grendel-scan.com
   also
http://www.linux-magazine.com/online/news/grendel_scan_1_0_automatic_security_check_for_web_applications

Heck for "infrastructure" type issues with Web Apps, you'll get really 
far with Nikto 2:
(Planned to be on the Portugal release of the OWASP Live CD 2008)
http://www.cirt.net/nikto2

[lists]
As for lists, there's lots of them.  I enumerated 300+ web app tools 
when working on the SoC project.  All of them are linked off here:
http://mtesauro.com/livecd/index.php?title=Potential_Tool_List
   what's on the SoC release is here:
http://mtesauro.com/livecd/index.php?title=Current_Tool_List

Other lists by other parties:
http://sectools.org/web-scanners.html
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix/Tools
https://samate.nist.gov/index.php/Web_Application_Vulnerability_Scanners

That should keep you busy for a while  ; )

BTW, I've got AppScan where I work so I could show you it if you are 
considering a purchase.  Just let me know.  Its NOT cheap at all.

David,

We use AMP which an enterprise version of webinspect. The tool is a nice fit into your SDLC test processes. While these tool are helpful they do have technical limitations.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Email address as login
Message-ID: <48ed007b.0c1e640a.0542.5f44@mx.google.com>

 

I'm managing a team that is creating a web based account system. The
accounts will have stored payment information, as well as access to an
online game. Management has requested that we use email addresses as account
login name. This seems counterintuitive to me from a security perspective
for several reasons:

 

half of the equation for login

password reset mechanism uses that address with no other validation

we don't control email security for our users

 

The actual known risks of risks of account compromise are these:

 

compromised accounts can bill non-shippable, virtual goods to legitimate
owner's payment method

compromised accounts can block access to legitimate owner with no secondary
proof of ownership

 

Management's desire is for user convenience, and they cite many sites with
stored payment information that use email address as login (Amazon, Paypal,
etc.). 

 

I am wondering if anyone has any opinions on the security of this type of
system, or published works that they could point me to. Are the security
risks for "email address as login" extreme paranoid edge cases, or do sites
that use this have a fair amount of security issues that they offset with
massive income? 

 

Thanks

 

Chris

I'm only hitting one point for now.  I'll try and send more info when I
get the chance as I've got the clock ticking on an up coming meeting.
Luckily I type fast...

> Management's desire is for user convenience, and they cite many sites

> Paypal, etc.).

I had a similar argument along those lines.  What you need to think
about is if Amazon & Paypal's customer profiles match your customer
profiles.  In my case, it was totally opposite.

Here's my point:  For my case, we don't get $'s from the users in
question.  So for us, compromised accounts represent a cost without any
income to offset the loss.

The real question for you is if the increased income from making logins
easier will be greater than the costs from the loss of sensitive data.
Considering PCI requirements, increasing legal requirements for breach
notification, etc, you will really need to look at the revenue gained by
user convenience.  I have no idea of your revenue models, but estimating
the cost of a breach may give you some good numbers to work with.  Don't
forget to consider soft costs like loss of reputation, goodwill, etc.

I'm not saying email address is universally bad.  I'd love to have Jeff
Bezos's income.  Email address seems to be working for him.  What we
don't know is what mechanism(s) are in place at Amazon to mitigate that
risk.  They could basically be self-insuring by accepting a revenue loss
for account compromise, assuming their revenue is adequate.

HTH.  Off to meeting.

Josh is also a frequent contributor on the Web Admin Blog.Topic: Using  
Proxies to Secure Applications and MoreThe last Austin OWASP presentation  
of the year is a must see for anyone responsible for the security of a web  
application. It is a demonstration of the various types of proxy software  
and their uses. We've all heard about WebScarab, BurpSuite, RatProxy, or  
Paros but how familiar are you with actually using them to inspect for web  
security issues? Did you know that you can use RatProxy for W3C compliance  
validation? By the time you leave this presentation, you will be able to go  
back to your office and wow your co-workers with the amazing new proxy  
skills that you've acquired.Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac,

Topic: Using Proxies to Secure Applications and More

The last Austin OWASP presentation of the year is a must see for anyone
responsible for the security of a web application. It is a demonstration of
the various types of proxy software and their uses. We've all heard about
WebScarab, BurpSuite, RatProxy, or Paros but how familiar are you with
actually using them to inspect for web security issues? Did you know that
you can use RatProxy for W3C compliance validation? By the time you leave
this presentation, you will be able to go back to your office and wow your
co-workers with the amazing new proxy skills that you've acquired.

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building C which is the tallest
building on campus (8 levels). There will be signs posted in the lobby to
direct you where to go and the receptionists will be able to assist you as
well. See directions to National
Instruments.<http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=11500+N+Mo-Pac+Expy,+Austin,+TX+78759&ie=UTF8&ll=30.406377,-97.726135&spn=0.017211,0.036778&om=1>

All,

While I've had experience with vulnerability scanners (Core, Nessus, etc) I've never really looked into what's out there with regards to vuln scanners that focus on Web Application Vulnerability scanning.  I'm trying to compile a list of security tools that are "out there" and was wondering what you all know about/use/recommend.  I have a pretty full list of other tools, but my web app section is pretty lean. Any thoughts? Could be open source, commercial, etc. 

Thanks

David H.

Hi all,

We had a great meeting yesterday and Josh Sokol did an excellent job giving
an overview of proxies, we had over 35 people attend and it was really great
to see all of you.

If you are interested in speaking at OWASP or if you want to get more
involved in chapter leadership, please email me.  Remember that our next
meeting is January 27th (last Tuesday of the month).

One last thing. All video content is now online from OWASP APPSEC NYC 2008.
Online is video from all 50+ speakers at www.owasp.tv FREE for your viewing
pleasure. We encourage you to watch the keynote "where we are and where we
are going" for important information and reinforcement of the Mission of
OWASP.

Best,
James

Yes, this last session was great - and people really missed out on the one
before.  We only had 3 people show in September, and Josh went through all
the sessions he attended at OWASP NYC in depth, there was lots of great
stuff.  Josh, are those slides up on the OWASP Austin site or something?
(Maybe we shoudl start slidesharing all these?)

The slides are up under our Austin OWASP page in the Presentations section 
at the bottom.  Here is a direct link:

https://www.owasp.org/images/f/ff/Using_Proxies_to_secure_applications_and_more.pptx

If you weren't there, then you missed the actual demo portion, but the 
slides do at least tell you what technology I used to do the demo and 
gives the URL's that I was using.  Enjoy!
