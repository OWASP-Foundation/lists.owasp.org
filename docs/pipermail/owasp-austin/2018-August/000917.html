<PRE>Hello everyone!

The OWASP Austin Chapter monthly meeting for September will be *Tuesday,
September 25, 2018*.  This will be our last chapter meeting of the year,
with the next one to be in January.  We of course will have LASCON in
October.

Please register on Eventbrite so that we can be sure to order enough food
for everyone.

Here are the details ...

*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for September*

*When:* Tuesday, September 25th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

*Where: *National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Title:* Scaling Your Cyber Security Threat Modeling





*There are two schools of thought around threat modeling. One school
advocates the creation of attack trees and data flow diagrams. This
requires extensive, cross-functional, security skills and is not a scalable
approach. The other school encourages organic insertion of defenses based
only on current context without &#8220;boiling the ocean&#8221;. This lack of systems
thinking leaves applications vulnerable as exploits in a weaker component
can open the door to critical systems.Part of the problem is threat
modeling today is largely an art. We need to inject more science in this
domain and derive a repeatable and auditable approach that maps to risk.
Such a model should abstract away the non-scalable elements and still
provide a high degree of assurance in today&#8217;s faster velocity business
context.This presentation will outline a threat modeling framework that
abstracts traditional methods into systems, data, and people components.
You will come away with an approach that takes away some of the scalability
problems of traditional threat modeling, yet provides sufficient rigor and
systems thinking to help manage risk.*

*Speaker:* Pranoy De - Software Engineer



*Pranoy currently works as a backend developer at Security Compass, helping
to develop industry-leading application security products. Over the years,
Pranoy has taken on a variety of roles, which included working as a
software consultant, working as a network engineer, and writing software
for the VFX industry.As a network engineer, Pranoy has primarily spent his
time developing and conducting planned DDoS attacks for companies testing
their defenses. This was his first position in the world of cybersecurity,
and it eventually lead to his current role in application security.*


*Food: *Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have
enough for all!
