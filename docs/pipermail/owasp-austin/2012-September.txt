Subject: [Owasp-austin] Vote in the OWASP Board Elections!
Message-ID: <CAFwvDexj+=8f9D2Oxkq4sq+wUkynhQbcbFaA_-tQdLO9NEJoPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Austin OWASPers!

I've been pretty silent lately letting David take over running things for
the chapter, but am definitely still around.  I've even taken on a new (as
of January) role as the Chair of the OWASP Global Chapters Committee.  I
wanted to reach out to all of you to let you know that our OWASP Austin
Chapter is special.  We are special because we have more OWASP members in
our chapter than pretty much any other OWASP Chapter in the world (thanks
to our LASCON Conference).  What this means is that our chapter has a huge
advantage in swaying the results of the upcoming OWASP International Board
of Directors election.  Information on the election candidates can be found
here <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2012_Election>, but since
I know that many of you aren't familiar with the inner-workings of OWASP, I
wanted to tell you my personal experiences with a couple of the candidates:

*Matt Tesauro:*  Hopefully most of you have had the chance to get to know
Matt as he is the only Texas candidate and has been involved with our local
chapter for many years.  He has also served on the OWASP Board for a couple
years now and has been a huge asset in relaying our chapter interests back
to the Foundation.  He's the leader for the OWASP WTE Project and he's
helped with our LASCON planning as well.

*Jim Manico:* Jim is one of the most passionate Application Security people
I have ever met.  He is the host of the OWASP Podcast and travels the world
on WhiteHat's dime speaking about Application Security.  He has spoken at
LASCON and was in Austin speaking at our chapter meeting a couple months
back.  He has not been on the OWASP Board before, but I've spoken with Jim
a number of times on his platform and I believe that he would be an amazing
asset to the Board.

Obviously, this is just my opinion and you are all free to vote for whoever
you would like.  These are certainly other very qualified candidates who
are running, but I wanted to highlight these two individuals who have
directly contributed to the success of our local chapter.  And regardless
of the "who", I sincerely hope that you all will at least take the
opportunity to vote.  As always, feel free to reach out to me if you have
any questions.

Subject: New OWASP membership deadline for 2012 election - Sept. 30, 2012
To: owasp-all at lists.owasp.org


OWASP Community Members -


The OWASP election is rapidly approaching!  Five candidates will be
competing for three seats in the OWASP International Board of Directors. The
candidate interviews have been posted. Please scroll to the bottom of 2012
Election <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2012_Election> and
listen to the interviews.



Voting right is reserved for members only. In order for more people to be
able to vote, the Global Membership Committee has postponed the deadlines
of both paid and honorary membership to Sept. 30, 2012.



*Paid Members: * Click
here<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag5ZloRZ0SmjdG9EOHg0amw3UVVySWZZMlloRVZOSGc#gid=0>
to
find out if you are currently a member. There is no need for paid member to
apply for honorary membership even if he/she qualifies. As a matter of
fact, many qualified people paid their membership anyway because they want
to support all OWASP projects and conferences even if they may not be able
to participate in person.

* *

*Honorary Members:* Click
here<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2012_Election> to
find out if you are eligible.  You must complete the Honorary Membership
Form<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dHA4dno2TlhSa0pVSUNQclZCOWROV0E6MQ>
to
apply.



The benefits of a paid membership go far beyond voting rights. For example,
you will get a prestigious OWASP email address, discount at reputable
conferences like OWASP AppSec and BlackHat, access to influential industry
groups as well as various grants offered by OWASP and other information
security companies. For less than a dollar a week, you will become a proud
contributor to a financially strong OWASP. If you live in a developing
country then the membership fee is even less due to the GDP discount.



Your vote counts!  Join today<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership_Map>

*September OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting (Sponsored by SolarWinds)

*This is our last Chapter meeting of the year!


*When*: Tomorrow, September 25th, 11:30am-1:00pm

*Topic:* Vulnerability Spidey Sense
*
**Speakers: *Daniel Crowely and Chris Vinecombe

*Daniel Crowley *- Daniel (aka "unicornFurnace") is an Application
Security Consultant for Trustwave's SpiderLabs team. He has been working
in the information security industry for over 7 years and has been
focused on penetration testing, specifically on Web applications. Daniel
denies all allegations regarding unicorn smuggling and questions your
character for evensuggesting it. Daniel has developed configurable
testbeds such as SQLol and XMLmao for training and research regarding
specific vulnerabilities. Daniel enjoys climbing large rocks. Daniel is
a frequent speaker at conferences including DEFCON, Shmoocon, and
SOURCE. Daniel does his own charcuterie.

*Chris Vinecombe* - Chris Vinecombe is an Application Security Analyst
for Trustwave's SpiderLabs team.  He has been working in the information
security industry for 2 years.  He currently focuses on penetration
testing, specifically web application security.  He is eager to learn
ALL the things.

*Abstract:* A dedicated attacker does not have time limitations when
attempting to find vulnerabilities in a target. As a penetration tester,
you are bound by certain restrictions, including scope, attack methods,
and time/date restrictions. Because of these restrictions, it's helpful
to prioritize certain targets over others to increase your chances of
breaking in. This talk will cover scenarios which raise red flags for
us, why, and how to develop your own sense of intuition.

*RSVP:* http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4319523812

*Cost:* Free, thanks to our Sponsor this month. Please RSVP so we will
know how many to expect.

Hello,

I was at the chapter meeting Tuesday and my name was called to win one of the AMEX gift cards from Solarwinds.  This was a great gift until I tried to use it only to find out it had expired July 2010.  I hope this was an honest mistake and I can get another gift card from David.  Please advise??
