Subject: [Owasp-austin] TVA Cyber Security Tool Webinar developed by GMU
Message-ID: <92E3E380443004498826FD1FB70A4E0A01453408@be44.exg3.exghost.com>

We are hosting an online presentation on the TVA (Topological
Vulnerability Analysis) tool which was created by the Center for Secure
Information Systems (CSIS) department at George Mason University. 

 

Currently used by DHS, NSA, AFRL, FAA, DISA, NIST & US Strategic
Command, CAULDRON, allows for the transformation of raw security data
into road maps that allow users to proactively prepare for attacks,
manage vulnerability risks and have real-time situational awareness.
CAULDRON provides informed risk analysis, analyzes vulnerability
dependencies and shows all possible attack paths into a network. In this
way, it accounts for sophisticated attack strategies that may penetrate
an organization's layered defenses.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Tuesday's OWASP Meeting: Invite some peeps
Message-ID: <f25fbcdc0905241518ubba78b9w4e394c25b25c688a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I just want to remind you that OWASP is meeting on Tuesday, May 26th.
RSnake will be talking about clickjacking and it should be really great.
You can see event info at http://austin.owasp.org

I wanted to send this note to say that this is a great talk to invite your
boss and coworkers too.  Any organic promotion you can do for this talk
would be great.  We released the info on this talk a little late, so any
thing you can do to spread the word is appreciated (linkedin, twitter,
facebook, myspace, email, phone calls, txting...).

National Instruments has graciously provided a room for us and snacks
(cookies and drinks).  Thanks NI for being such a great supporter of OWASP!

Best,
James
