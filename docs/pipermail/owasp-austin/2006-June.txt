I believe that the Austin group is just getting started and is gearing
up for its first meeting.  For folks on the list: what topics would be
interesting for the initial get-together?

Hi All.

I am really interested in AJAX Security and any new updates in the
application vulnerability testing space... If anyone is using WebScarab etc
would be good to here real world examples etc..

Cheers.
Shane

If you are interested in AJAX security, I would point you toward the
open source sprajax tool I wrote a while back:
<http://www.denimgroup.com/sprajax/>

It only has support for Microsoft Atlas right now, but I am about to
release support for the Google Web Toolkit.  "Almost" is a relative term
as I have been trying to find the time to finish this support for a
copule of weeks now...  In any case I think the underlying idea is sound
(footprint and fuzz AJAX applications to find technical application
vulnerabilities).

I also did an AJAX security presentation for the San Antonio OWASP and
the slide deck can be found here: <http://www.denimgroup.com/knowledge/>
Look down the page for "Here We Go Again"  This presentation talks about
AJAX security in general and then talk about the architecture for
sprajax.

Depending on what folks want to do I could give an updated version of
that presentation before too much longer.

Thanks,

Dan

I have used it but not to its full extent and mostly just to show a
client how easy it is bypass browser-based validation, GUI's look
better for demos.

I'd love to hear about "advanced" usage, beanshell scripting, fuzzing,
etc. -- altough I've found that it is easier to write that stuff from
scratch (currently using Jython + jakarta httpclient)

I would be interested and could contribute to
discussions/presentations on J2EE & struts "stuff."

And threat modeling (especially if anyone is actually using it and
clients find it useful).

Dan,

Thanks for the link. While that as good an introduction to the
topic/Microsoft approach I was looking for something beyond the 101
level, because I've found the devil is in the details, whether you are
doing threat modeling or attack trees or whatever you want to call it.

While it would be a mistake to ignore all that Microsoft has published
and released, it is far from perfect. STRIDE for example, which
conflates attacker techniques/methods with goals. And the 1st release
of the TM tool was sort of limiting in that you were pretty much
locked into their approach which is why I've ended up using Freemind
on a number of projects.

See http://iang.org/maps/browser_attack_tree.html for an example

Perhaps do some sort sort generic threat models (kind of like what I

Greetings,

 

A quick update to what is planned for the Austin chapter:

 

Organize:

*	I am procuring a meeting place for our kickoff meeting - should
have confirmation by next week
*	I need some assistance - web/list moderator, marketing...,
chapter leadership

 

For the kickoff:

*	Speakers from the San Antonio chapter have volunteered!

 

Expectations (mine):

*	Market this important topic to the techno crowds at other Austin
meetings
*	Get some real, detailed, techical exposure of web security
disseminated to Austin folks
*	Create organic participation

 

If you are interested in participating in the organizational side of the
Austin OWASP - please send me an email and let me know what your "gift"
is.

 

Best regards,

cd...

Dan,

Thanks for the link. While that as good an introduction to the
topic/Microsoft approach I was looking for something beyond the 101
level, because I've found the devil is in the details, whether you are
doing threat modeling or attack trees or whatever you want to call it.

While it would be a mistake to ignore all that Microsoft has published
and released, it is far from perfect. STRIDE for example, which
conflates attacker techniques/methods with goals. And the 1st release
of the TM tool was sort of limiting in that you were pretty much
locked into their approach which is why I've ended up using Freemind
on a number of projects.

See http://iang.org/maps/browser_attack_tree.html for an example

Perhaps do some sort sort generic threat models (kind of like what I
did for routing protocols several years back in
http://www.threatmind.net/oldio/papers/draft-convery-bgpattack-01.txt)
for an application server, servlet/J2EE container, or perhaps a
specific appserver like JBoss or Geronimo.

Greetings,

 

A quick update to what is planned for the Austin chapter:

 

Organize:

*	I am procuring a meeting place for our kickoff meeting - should
have confirmation by next week
*	I need some assistance - web/list moderator, marketing...,
chapter leadership

 

For the kickoff:

*	Speakers from the San Antonio chapter have volunteered!

 

Expectations (mine):

*	Market this important topic to the techno crowds at other Austin
meetings
*	Get some real, detailed, techical exposure of web security
disseminated to Austin folks
*	Create organic participation

 

If you are interested in participating in the organizational side of the
Austin OWASP - please send me an email and let me know what your "gift"
is.

 

Best regards,

cd...
