<PRE>Hello OWASP Austin!

Some of you are familiar with the OWASP Austin Study Group, while others
may have only heard a little bit about it. The OWASP Austin Study Group is
a gathering of mostly IT security professionals, meeting on a weekly basis,
to learn and discuss topics related to IT security, with goal to share in a
learning experience to enhance their skills and knowledge. The group has
just finished studying the book *Web Application Defender's Cookbook:
Battling Hackers and Protecting Users*, and is working to identify the next
topic.

A survey has been created to obtain votes on the next study group topic. If
you can take the time between now and the end of the week (Friday, April
25), please visit the survey and provide your input.  It will ask for a
ranking of five topics that have been mentioned the most as topics of
interest:

<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7WWR29H">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7WWR29H</A>

Tentative start date will be mid May, depending upon response to poll/vote
and time needed to obtain any book required.

A few notes:

While the study group is affiliated with OWASP and the OWASP Austin
chapter, there is no requirement to be an OWASP member.  However, you may
find there are more benefits with being a member.  For more information on
the Austin Chapter and link to becoming a member, see
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin.</A>

To help with collaborating on the study group topics, we currently use Ning
discussion forums. If you wish to participate in future study group topics,
or at minimum to keep track of what is going on and perhaps provide
feedback, then please sign up and join the group at
<A HREF="http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austinowaspstudygroup.">http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austinowaspstudygroup.</A>

Some topics have been suggested related to studying for specific
certifications.  The thought on this is that it would be too specific for a
general study group.  Instead, the best approach would be to coordinate a
separate group of those who are interested in obtaining the certification,
where one or two of those in that group would organize the meeting time and
meeting place.  As the Training/Study Coordinator, I would be happy to help
facilitate the start-up of a &quot;Certification Study Group&quot;.   Just let me
know.


If you have any questions about the study group, please feel free to
contact me.

Thanks!

Tiana Chandler
