&gt;<i> OWASP Austin,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was approached by the Austin ISSA Chapter to do a training on my
</I>&gt;<i> SimpleRisk project and risk management basics and we finally have scheduled
</I>&gt;<i> a half-day event in the afternoon on Thursday, May 1st.  It is $10 to
</I>&gt;<i> register, but the full amount will be refunded to you provided that you
</I>&gt;<i> attend the training.  That means that in reality, this training is FREE.
</I>&gt;<i> This opportunity is limited to the first 50 people who sign up and you do
</I>&gt;<i> not have to be an ISSA member to register.  Details follow below.

</I>&gt;<i> Risk Management Like a Boss: Making Your Risks Work for You
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Join Austin ISSA for a half day Advanced Training Session with renowned
</I>&gt;<i> Information Security Management Expert Josh Sokol. *
</I>&gt;<i> *Thursday, May 1st, 1 - 4:30pm* *A laptop with wireless card is required!*
</I>&gt;<i>  $10 Admission, pre-registration required
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *(Admission fee will be refunded to all pre-registered attendees that sign
</I>&gt;<i> up before the early registration deadline!) *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Abstract:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Arguably, the single most valuable skill that you can learn in Information
</I>&gt;<i> Security today in order to improve your security posture for tomorrow is
</I>&gt;<i> Risk Management. The simple process of identifying your risks, planning
</I>&gt;<i> your mitigations, and performing reviews puts your company squarely in the
</I>&gt;<i> drivers seat when it comes to justifying its security expenditures in order
</I>&gt;<i> to reduce risk. SimpleRisk is the only free and open source alternative to
</I>&gt;<i> the bloated and expensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platforms
</I>&gt;<i> out there and is being used by corporations of all sizes, around the world,
</I>&gt;<i> to perform their risk management activities. During this half-day seminar,
</I>&gt;<i> Josh Sokol, the Creator of SimpleRisk, will walk attendees through the
</I>&gt;<i> basics of risk management using hands-on activities and the SimpleRisk
</I>&gt;<i> tool. By the end of the course, attendees will have the knowledge necessary
</I>&gt;<i> in order to deploy SimpleRisk in their environment, use it to manage their
</I>&gt;<i> risks, and have a firm grasp on the processes involved in managing risks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Josh's Biography:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a
</I>&gt;<i> BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several
</I>&gt;<i> large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a
</I>&gt;<i> military contractor, and is currently employed as the Information Security
</I>&gt;<i> Program Owner at National Instruments. In his current role, Sokol manages
</I>&gt;<i> all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> management activities for NI. Sokol created the free and open source risk
</I>&gt;<i> management tool named SimpleRisk, has spoken on dozens of security topics
</I>&gt;<i> including the much-hyped &#8220;HTTPSCan Byte Me&#8221; talk at Black Hat 2010, and
</I>&gt;<i> currently serves on the OWASP Global Board of Directors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Be sure to reserve your spot for this half-day training event now! Seats
</I>&gt;<i> will fill up quickly and space is limited. The cost of attendance is *$10
</I>&gt;<i> *which will be refunded if you register early and make the event.
