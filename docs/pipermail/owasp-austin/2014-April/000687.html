<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers!

I can't believe it has already been a month since Bsides and the March
meeting.  The happy hour was a great event and more are upcoming!

-------

The monthly chapter meeting will be a great one for hacking enthusiasts and
those especially interested in the Raspberry Pi.  If anyone else saw
Branden at BSides last month, you know he is a great speaker with awesome
hacks.

*OWASP Monthly meeting on April 29th: *
*11:30 - 1 (really 11:45 - 1, we gotta eat sometime)*

*Title: **Covert Hacking and Application Testing with Raspberry Pi*

*Abstract: *The $35 Raspberry Pi is a wonder device on the cheap! But the
security impact of this cheap and powerful equipment with its tiny
footprint is equally interesting. In this session you will learn how the Pi
can be used as a covert, field-friendly hacking platform for less than $100
total. The talk will address both attack and defense scenarios against the
device. We will also discuss some of the applications for Pi around
application security and penetration testing.

*Speaker: Branden Williams *is well known in the industry as a
practitioner, consultant, and thought leader. He spent a number of years
helping companies solve major security and compliance problems, including
building PCI DSS compliance programs for some of the largest retailers
around the globe. He recently sat on the PCI Board of Advisors and
published the third edition of his book, PCI Compliance (Syngress, 2012) in
August. Branden routinely speaks with organizations big and small with
various levels of regulation to help them reduce their overall risk
footprint and build safer and more efficient IT functions.

*Food:* Taco Deli time! Courtesy of the LASCON conference put on by OWASP
Austin. Please *RSVP* so we'll be sure to have enough for all! Only those
who RSVP will be eligible for any *drawings/giveaways* that may take place!

*Location: *National Instruments, 11500 N. MOPAC, Building C

*RSVP: *owasp-austin-2014-april.eventbrite.com

Or if  can not attend we should be broadcasting the meeting GoToMeeting --
