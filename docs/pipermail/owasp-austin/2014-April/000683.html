<PRE>OWASP Austin,

I was approached by the Austin ISSA Chapter to do a training on my
SimpleRisk project and risk management basics and we finally have scheduled
a half-day event in the afternoon on Thursday, May 1st.  It is $10 to
register, but the full amount will be refunded to you provided that you
attend the training.  That means that in reality, this training is FREE.
This opportunity is limited to the first 50 people who sign up and you do
not have to be an ISSA member to register.  Details follow below.

Risk Management Like a Boss: Making Your Risks Work for You


*Join Austin ISSA for a half day Advanced Training Session with renowned
Information Security Management Expert Josh Sokol.*
*Thursday, May 1st, 1 - 4:30pm* *A laptop with wireless card is required!*  $10
Admission, pre-registration required

*(Admission fee will be refunded to all pre-registered attendees that sign
up before the early registration deadline!)*

*Abstract:*

Arguably, the single most valuable skill that you can learn in Information
Security today in order to improve your security posture for tomorrow is
Risk Management. The simple process of identifying your risks, planning
your mitigations, and performing reviews puts your company squarely in the
drivers seat when it comes to justifying its security expenditures in order
to reduce risk. SimpleRisk is the only free and open source alternative to
the bloated and expensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platforms
out there and is being used by corporations of all sizes, around the world,
to perform their risk management activities. During this half-day seminar,
Josh Sokol, the Creator of SimpleRisk, will walk attendees through the
basics of risk management using hands-on activities and the SimpleRisk
tool. By the end of the course, attendees will have the knowledge necessary
in order to deploy SimpleRisk in their environment, use it to manage their
risks, and have a firm grasp on the processes involved in managing risks.

*Josh's Biography:*

Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a
BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several
large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a
military contractor, and is currently employed as the Information Security
Program Owner at National Instruments. In his current role, Sokol manages
all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability
management activities for NI. Sokol created the free and open source risk
management tool named SimpleRisk, has spoken on dozens of security topics
including the much-hyped &quot;HTTPSCan Byte Me&quot; talk at Black Hat 2010, and
currently serves on the OWASP Global Board of Directors.

Be sure to reserve your spot for this half-day training event now! Seats
will fill up quickly and space is limited. The cost of attendance is
*$10 *which
will be refunded if you register early and make the event.
