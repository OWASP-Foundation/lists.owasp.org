About the presentation: 
At the September meeting we will discuss the OWASP Testing Framework and
use it, along with free and Open Source tools, in a live and interactive
demonstration of web site penetration testing.  The idea here is to
build off of James Wickett's presentation on the OWASP Top 10 so if you
did not attend the July meeting it may be a good idea to brush up on
that subject at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Project.   

About the presenter: 
Josh Sokol has been working as a Systems Administrator for about 10
years and is currently working as a member of the Web Systems Team at
National Instruments.  He holds both a CCNA and SANS GWAS certification
and is currently working on an initiative to bring a more security
oriented mindset to the application developers at NI.
