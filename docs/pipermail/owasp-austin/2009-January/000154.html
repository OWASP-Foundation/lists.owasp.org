The presentation will include the following topics in addition to a hands-on
demonstration for each portion of the talk:

1. The statelessness of the internet

2. How the naive attack works

3. A mitigation strategy against this naive attack

4. An combined CSRF/XSS attack that defeats this mitigation strategy

5. And finally suggestions for mitigation of the combined attack
