Austin OWASPers,

The 2010 Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) held at the 
Norris Conference Center on Friday, October 29, 2010 was an astounding 
success.  Almost 200 security professionals from around the country came 
together to learn, share war stories, and have a good time.  Feedback from 
attendees, sponsors, and volunteers was overwhelmingly positive with 
almost everyone stating they would like to attend LASCON again next year. 
With things going as well as they did, we have decided to reserve the 
Norris Conference Center once again for Friday, October 28, 2011 for 
LASCON part deux.  If you are interested in sponsoring or volunteering for 
LASCON 2011, please let us know.  Mark your calendars today!

In 2011 the Austin OWASP chapter will be embarking on a group project 
titled the OWASP Secure Password Project.  This project will have a two 
pronged approach designed to put more nails in the single-factor method of 
authentication.  First, we will create an interactive portal where 
penetration testers are able to enter known information about the target. 
 This known information can then be broken down and converted to create a 
large downloadable dictionary list that has been customized to the target. 
 This list will be added to a comprehensive standard dictionary with the 
character conversions performed on that as well.  The result would be a 
large list of commonly used passwords, dictionary words, target specific 
passwords, and various derivitives of each which should cover the vast 
majority of passwords used today.  The second prong of our approach will 
be to capture the results of all data collected into a large database. 
 This data will be hashed with common hashing methods to create what will 
become the world's largest rainbow tables.  A user can provide us with a 
hash and we can do a lookup against these tables to search for matching 
entries.  The goal here is to put a stop to unsalted password hashes for 
authentication.  If you are interesting in participating in the project, 
please respond and let me know.  Everyone is welcome and we will begin our 
initial outline of the project in January 2011.

I am currently working on both the Austin OWASP Meeting topics and the 
Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour dates for the 2011 year.  If you 
are interested in presenting at our chapter meetings held on the last 
Tuesday of each month, please send me an abstract on what you would like 
to speak on as well as your bio.  We had some pretty awesome presentations 
last year and I'm looking to bring in some more people to Austin this year 
with our LASCON funds, but we definitely have room for presentations from 
chapter members as well.

Every once in a while people send me job postings and whatnot.  In order 
to minimize traffic to this group, I try and save them and send them along 
with my other correspondence.  Here is one such opportunity which I have 
more information on if you'd like it:

atsec is an international, independent, standards-based IT (information 
technology) security
consulting and evaluation services company that combines a 
business-oriented approach to
information security with in-depth technical knowledge and global 
experience.

We are looking for a security consultant whose primary role is to support 
our penetration
testing engagements. The ideal candidate has solid skills in both network 
and (web)
application testing, and would also be involved in atsec?s other security 
testing and
evaluation projects as appropriate.

Please send your resume and cover letter to us-jobs at atsec.com.

Josh,

I just finished attending the ISSA meeting for this month and I am a newbie to security, but have been in IT for the past 10 years or so.  I'm really interested in our Secure Password Project.  Do you mind sending me further information, if needed, and anything I would need to do to get involved in the project?  Thanks!

Event: Smart Phones with Dumb Apps - Austin OWASP Meeting
Date: Tuesday, January 25, 2011 from 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM (PT)
Location: <b>National Instruments - Conference Room 1S13</b><br />11500 North Mopac Expwy<br />Building C<br />Austin, TX 78759<br />

Event Details:
------------------------------ 

<p><strong>When:</strong> January 25, 2011, 11:30am - 1:00pm <br /><br /><strong>Topic:</strong> Smart Phones with Dumb Apps </p>
<p><br />Enterprises are targeting both internal users and customers with smartphone applications for platforms such as Apple iPhone and Google Android. Many of these applications are constructed without fully considering the associated security implications of their deployment. Breaches can impact both users as well as the enterprise distributing the application as attackers take advantage of expanded access to sensitive data and network services. This talk discusses emerging threats associated with deploying smartphone applications and provides an overview of the threat modeling process. The presentation then walks example applications from an attacker?s perspective demonstrating the sort of information they are able to extract allowing for more advanced attacks. </p>
<p><br /><strong>Who:</strong> Dan Cornell </p>
<p><br />Dan Cornell has over twelve years of experience architecting, developing and securing web-based software systems. As a Principal of Denim Group, he leads the organization's technology team overseeing methodology development and project execution for Denim Group's customers. He also heads the Denim Group application security research team, investigating the application of secure coding and development techniques to the improvement of web based software development methodologies. In addition, Dan Cornell performed as the CTO of BrandDefense, architecting and developing their cutting-edge intellectual property protection technologies. Over a one year period of development he brought their web-based intellectual property protection technologies through three major versions, surpassing the applications of well funded and entrenched competitors. Previously he was the Vice President, Global Competency Leader for Rare Medium's Java and Unix competency center, based in San Antonio, Texas with development centers in New York, San Francisco, Atlanta and Sydney, Australia. He directed the development of best practices and policy for the cornerstone of Rare Medium's technical development arm, specializing in server-side Java application development. Prior to its acquisition by Rare Medium, Cornell was a founder and Vice President of Engineering for Atension, Inc. where he led the technical development team and served as the architect for the company's internal engineering practices. In March 1999, Texas Monthly magazine named Cornell and his partners, Sheridan Chambers and Tyson Weihs, to its list of 30 "Multimedia Whizzes Under Thirty" doing business in Texas. </p>

Austin OWASPers,

Are any of you a whiz at graphic design?  Think the logo for LASCON 2010 
was lame and you can do better?  Let's put your money where your mouth is 
and make it happen.  We need two designs for LASCON 2011:

1) We need a new conference logo.  This logo will be 
everywhere....conference booklets, signs, promo materials, websites, etc. 

2) We need LASCON 2011 T-shirts.  Last year's design (done by me of 
course) was a huge hit, but we want to have different T-shirts every year. 
 The three best designs will be selected.  Get creative.  No design is too 
over the top here.

The selected logo and T-shirt designers will each receive a complimentary 
full conference pass to LASCON 2011 at the Norris Conference Center on 
October 28, 2011.  They will also each receive a $50 gift certificate good 
for a purchase at the conference OWASP store.  Take this nice long holiday 
break to get busy designing and send your submissions to 
josh.sokol at owasp.org.  Submissions for the conference logo are due by 
March 1, 2011 and submissions for the T-shirt design are due by June 1, 
2011.  Let's see what you got!

--------------------------------------

On a side note, Alberto sent me a note on a job opening at St. Edwards 
that he thought you guys might be interested in:
