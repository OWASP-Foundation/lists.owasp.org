<PRE>**Reminder Today **   
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin</A>&gt; is an open community dedicated
to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain
applications that can be trusted.  We advocate approaching application
security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most
effective approaches to application security includes improvements in
all of these areas.

Each month during our chapter meeting, a subject matter expert will
present and discuss one of the OWASP top 10 topics
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten</A>&gt; . OWASP chapter meetings
are free and open to anyone interested in application security.
