  Topic: Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization              
                                                                            
                                                                            
  The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting     
  topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization.   
  The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of      
  passing around the data itself. For example, why would you give a         
  customer account representative a full credit card number when all they   
  need to do their job is the last four digits? Using tokenization, we are  
  able to reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems   
  that actually store the data. This extremely simplifies audits for        
  regulations like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. This presentation will cover    
  the business drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how   
  to implement it. If your organization has data to protect, then you're    
  going to want to check out this presentation.
