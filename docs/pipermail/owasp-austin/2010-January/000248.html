<PRE>Happy New Year Austin OWASPers!

First off, after two years of serving as the Austin OWASP Chapter 
President, James Wickett has decided to step aside and let someone else 
take the reigns for a while.  As such, he has asked me to take over as 
President beginning this month.  James has some pretty big shoes to fill 
(pun intended), but I will try my hardest to continue to make the Austin 
OWASP Chapter one of the best in the country.  If you have any suggestions 
on how we can make that happen, please do not hesitate to shoot me an 
e-mail.  And don't worry, James will continue to be very active with 
OWASP, serving as the chapter's new Vice President.

Austin Security Executives Happy Hours - Thursday, January 14, 5-7 PM
On to more pressing business...we've decided to kick the new year off 
right with another super awesome Happy Hour event.  From now on, we're 
joining forces with the Capitol of Texas ISSA group and calling these the 
Austin Security Executives Happy Hour.  The first Happy Hour event is 
scheduled for this Thursday (1/14) from 5-7 PM at Sherlock's (183 and 
Burnet).  Past happy hours have proven to be quite awesome so don't miss 
out on this opportunity to network with your security comrades and drink 
cheap drinks. 

Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization - Tuesday, January 
26, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting 
topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization. 
The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of 
passing around the data itself.  For example, why would you give a 
customer account representative a full credit card number when all they 
need to do their job is the last four digits?  Using tokenization, we are 
able to reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems 
that actually store the data.  This extremely simplifies audits for 
regulations like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.  This presentation will cover 
the business drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how to 
implement it.  If your organization has data to protect, then you're going 
to want to check out this presentation.

We are currently in the process of lining up meeting topics for the coming 
months.  If you are interested in presenting on a topic or have some 
topics that you think would be good for someone else to present at an 
OWASP meeting, please send me an e-mail to let me know.  Thanks!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CCNA, GWAS)
Austin OWASP President
