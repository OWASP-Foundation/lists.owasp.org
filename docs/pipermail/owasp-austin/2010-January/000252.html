<PRE>Hello OWASPers! 

Don't forget that we will be having our first Austin OWASP meeting of the 
year tomorrow.  The meeting will be held at our usual location (National 
Instruments - Building C) in our usual room during our usual time (11:30 
AM to 1:00 PM).  The topic for the meeting is &quot;Reducing Your Data Security 
Risk Through Tokenization&quot; and I will be presenting, but I'd really like 
for this to be a discussion where everyone can share their thoughts on 
Tokenization in the enterprise.  A summary of what I intend to talk about 
is below. 

Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization - Tuesday, January 
26, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM 
The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting 
topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization. 
The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of 
passing around the data itself. For example, why would you give a customer 
account representative a full credit card number when all they need to do 
their job is the last four digits? Using tokenization, we are able to 
reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems that 
actually store the data. This extremely simplifies audits for regulations 
like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. This presentation will cover the business 
drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how to implement 
it. If your organization has data to protect, then you're going to want to 
check out this presentation. 

Austin Security Executives Happy Hour - Thursday, February 11, 2010, 5:00 
PM - 7:00 PM 
The January happy hour event was a huge success with over 27 of the best 
and brightest security executives in attendance.  If you weren't one of 
them, then you were certainly missing out, but we're willing to give you 
another chance.  We've scheduled another happy hour event for Thursday, 
February 11 from 5-7 PM at the same location (Sherlock's on Burnet and 
183).  Even better, WhiteHat Security (<A HREF="http://www.whitehatsec.com">http://www.whitehatsec.com</A>) has 
graciously offered to sponsor the event so look forward to food and drinks 
on them.  Don't miss out on this exciting opportunity to network with your 
fellow security executives!
