Security?


Targeted attacks, slow moving malware, foreign intelligence/government

really. These vectors are occurring today, and the threat vector has bled
into the application space. What do you have to contend with once it passes
through the firewall.

RSVP on the Austin OWASP Ning Site
I've had a few people call me and ask if this is still going on.
Absolutely!  Our presenter drove in from Houston this morning and is here
at NI already.  Our sponsor has ordered plenty of food and drinks.  If your
office is closing for some reason, feel free to come on over to NI and hang
out in the lobby.  I will be down there around 11 AM and we can get into
the room at that time.  Drive safely and we'll see you soon!
