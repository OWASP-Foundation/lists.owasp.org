<PRE>Even with all of the snow, we had a great attendance at today's OWASP 
meeting with a fantastic speaker.  Thanks to everyone who came out.  Matt 
will be sending me a PDF of his slides in the next few days and I will get 
those up on the OWASP website for anyone who would like a copy.  There 
were some fantastic charts in there.  Also, for anyone who is interested 
in attending the Austin Security Summit on DNSSec that Dean talked about 
today, the information and enrollment link is below.  I will be sending 
out an invite in a little bit for our March Austin Security Professionals 
Happy Hour as well.  Drive safely!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CCNA, GWAS)
