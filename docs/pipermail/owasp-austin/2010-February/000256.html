Advanced Persistent Threat - What Does it Mean for Applications Security? 
- Tuesday, February 23, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
For our February Austin OWASP meeting, we have Matt Pour, SE for Blue Coat 
Systems, and former Security Solutions Architect and X-Force Field 
Engineer for IBM ISS.  He will be talking to us about the Advanced 
Persisitent Threat and what it means for Application Security.  Targeted 
attacks, slow moving malware, foreign intelligence/government sponsored 
hackers, corporate/industrial espionage &#8211; all fun and games?  Not really. 
These vectors are occurring today, and the threat vector has bled into the 
application space.  What do you have to contend with once it passes 
through the firewall.  The meeting will be on Tuesday, February 23 from 
11:30 AM to 1:00 PM at National Instruments, Building C, as usual.  As an 
extra-special treat, this meeting will have lunch sponsored by Expanding 
Security, an awesome local company that you can leverage for great CISSP 
training, informative Security Summits, and much more!
