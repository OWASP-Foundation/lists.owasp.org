<PRE>Hey, does anyone here have ideas for web security ideas that they
don't really have time to investigate or implement themselves, and so
would be willing to share freely with others who may suddenly find
themselves with talent, a lot of time on their hands, but negative
cash flow? ;-)

I'm looking at potential business opportunities, and given how bad web
security really is, it seems like an underserved market.  However, I'm
just starting to brainstorm and research what tools &amp; services exist
and what have yet to be created.  I have several ideas, and some vague
possible directions, but was wondering what others thought.

One of my ideas I'm willing to share is to mine web server logs for
better analytics, worms, attack trends, anomaly detection, usability
analysis (or stickiness), and maybe even post-facto IDS.  There may be
a problem, though, in terms of sheer volume.

Cheers,
Travis

PS: Bear in mind:

     An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of
     would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is
     the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is
     execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms
     with a brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a
     nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That
     shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less
     than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.
