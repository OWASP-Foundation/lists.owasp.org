  Topic: Javascript Hijacking                                               
                                                                            
                                                                            
  This attack is an offshoot of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and is    
  common when AJAX is involved. It was well publicized in 2007 when the     
  gmail contact list was found by Jeremiah Grossman to be vulnerable to it. 
  This presentation will include a technical explanation of the attack, a   
  demonstration, and a discussion.                                          
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Who: Ben Broussard (UT Austin)                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Ben Broussard is a developer for the University of Texas at Austin with   
  an academic background in mathematics, specifically cryptography. At UT   
  he has translated and prioritized web application attacks in relation to  
  the environment that the developers are working in. Ben is currently      
  leading a web application security focused team of developers from        
  different departments around campus.                                      
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Topic: Attacking Intranets from the Web Using DNS Rebinding               
                                                                            
                                                                            
  DNS Rebinding works by implementing code that circumvents the web         
  browser's same-origin policy and penetrates your private network. The     
  exploit was popularized by RSnake in 2009. This presentation will explore 
  how DNS Rebinding works, a walk-thru of a running demo, and what it means 
  to your organization.
