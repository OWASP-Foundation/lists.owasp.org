OWASP Monthly Meeting on September 30th

When: 11:30AM to 1PM CST -- food socializing first, meeting starts around
11:45
Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac Building C

Title: Account Entrapment

Abstract: This talk covers two ways to force a victim into an attacker's
account (Account Entrapment): Login Cross-Site Request Forgery and
Cookie-based or Session Entrapment. This is a commonly overlooked
vulnerability despite high-profile exploits including Youtube.com. Because
it is often disregarded, this talk begins with an in-depth look at attack
scenarios and what an attacker can actually gain. It then describes how the
two attacks work and how to defend against them. Finally, though these
attacks are prevalent across the internet, it will show why state agencies
(with domains ending in .state.**.us) and large organizations with many
subdomains face special problems when building defenses against these
attacks.

Speaker: Ben Broussard

About: Ben Broussard has been involved in the Austin Appsec scene since
2008, helping to plan the first LASCON and running the OWASP study group
for a time. After doing subcontracting work for a number of security shops
and gaining a breadth of experience on both the threatscape and the
security organizations that attempt to address it, he took a position with
San Antonio based Denim Group (now with an Austin office). When not
researching appsec, Ben is a hobbyist in Human Physiology, Acrobatics,
Human Evolution, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and toddler wrangling. He also runs
Hot Lava Obstacle Course located on Burnet road.

Food: Its a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough for all!
Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Risk Management Training @ LASCON (10/22)
Message-ID: <CAFwvDewyii-q7axjYoPGWyB-9hJ-BkBwXgDgqt0fkLpR1axMkg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone,

I hope that you all have taken the opportunity to sign up for this year's
Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON).  It features some of the
same high-quality speakers that you would find at conferences like BlackHat
at a fraction of the price.  It is also the biggest fundraiser for the
OWASP Austin chapter and provides the money that we need in order to
sustain things like food and giveaways without charging a fee like other
organizations are now doing.  The talks are up, the bull is back, and we
want to see you there.  Get registered if you haven't already at
http://lascon.org.  Passes are selling quickly so don't risk waiting so
long that they've sold out.

Speaking of risk....(see what I did there)....I will be doing a full-day
risk management training at this year's conference on 10/22.  If you
attended one of the half-days I did in Austin, San Antonio, or Minneapolis,
then this will be similar, but will also walk students through the process
of installing SimpleRisk and all of the finer details of working with the
tool that we didn't get into in the other class.  Instead of using the
hosted version of SimpleRisk, every student will walk away with a
functioning instance in a VM environment and the knowledge to perform the
installation, configuration, and management themselves.  Sure, you could go
out and spent $500k+ on a GRC tool that you'll never full utilize, or you
can spend a mere $249 to spend a day hanging out with me, talking risk
management, learning the ins and outs of SimpleRisk, with meals included.
You can register for my training at LASCON here:

http://lascon.org/training/risk-management-like-a-boss-making-your-risks-work-for-you1-day-training/

LASCON is a fantastic conference, run by great people, and benefiting the
OWASP Foundation.  I hope that you will take the time to register and join
us there next month!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
