Hello everyone!



The *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *for March will be *next week
and on a different day that normal - Wednesday, March 7th.*.  The reason
for the different day is that we are coordinating with BSides Austin
<https://bsidesaustin.com/>, which will be held Thursday and Friday, March
8-9. Our happy hour will again be at Baby A's on Stonelake Blvd in North
Austin.


Co-sponsors will be *Critical Start*.and *Mimecast*.  Here are the details:


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for March*

*When:* Wednesday, March 7th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where: *Baby A's, 9505-B Stonelake Blvd, Austin, Texas 78759 (corner of
Stonelake and York Blvd, between Hwy 183 and Mopac).  We will meet in the
area inside the restaurant, in the far left corner.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

*Co-sponsors:* Critical Start and Mimecast



Please *RSVP* so that we can get a headcount of how many attendees to
expect:

Subject: [Owasp-austin] LASCON 2018 Call for Papers (CFP) is now available!
Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu_kn=TPHwXNWrg+q6_N9RDF3dSD_DYs4sJ+0W28o+pGVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

We are excited to announce that the Call for Papers (CFP) is now available
for you to submit your talks for this year's LASCON 2018.  The link is
available on our LASCON website - https://lascon.org - but you can also go
to it directly at https://cfp.lascon.org.

You can sign up on the CFP site <https://cfp.lascon.org/signup> to register
and enter your information.  If you need some guidance on the types of
talks we are seeking, check out the Talk Ideas
<https://cfp.lascon.org/ideas> page.  The Speaker Package
<https://cfp.lascon.org/package> page provides other information related to
being a speaker at LASCON.

Please note that there are a few corrections needed on the site, which we
are working to make, such as the deadline date on the Speakers Package
page.  We are tentatively reviewing that deadline date to one that would
provide enough time for everyone to submit their topics while giving us
sufficient time to review, respond, and publish.  We will announce that
date soon.  In the meantime, we welcome your submissions and looking
forward to seeing all the great topics.

If you have any questions related to the CFP, please send them to
lascon+cfp at owasp.org, or contact our LASCON Conference Coordinator, Bankim
Tejani (bankim.tejani at owasp.org).
