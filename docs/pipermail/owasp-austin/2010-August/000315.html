<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

While there is still another week or so left for CFP submissions, the 
LASCON planning committee today voted on acceptance of the first batch of 
speakers and presentations for the conference.  Hopefully this preliminary 
list will get you guys as excited as I am about LASCON:

Presentation
Name
OWASP Top 10.  What is it all about?
Dean Bushmiller
Deconstructing ColdFusion
Chris Eng
HTTPS Can Byte Me
Robert Hasen and Josh Sokol
Smart Phones with Dumb Apps: Threat Modeling for Mobile Applications
Dan Cornell
How I Met Your Girlfriend
Samy Kamkar
Mitigating Business Risks with Application Security
Joe Jarzombek
Automating Web Testing Beyond OWASP Webscarab Using Python
Brad Causey
Everything Useful I Learned About Software Security, I Learned At 
Microsoft
Michael Howard

That's two presentations from this years BlackHat conference, several 
published authors, and the Director for Software Assurance in the National 
Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security just to 
name a few, and that's only the preliminary round of acceptances.  The 
complete list and schedule won't be out for a couple of weeks, but we're 
seeing a steady stream of registrations and passes may not last that long. 
 At only $50 for OWASP members and $100 for non-members (includes a year 
of OWASP membership) for a full day of training, this should be a 
no-brainer.  Register for LASCON today and be sure to tell your friends 
and co-workers to get their passes before they sell out!

We'd also like to thank Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, Splunk, and Impact 
Security LLC for being Gold Sponsors of LASCON 2010!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
President
Austin OWASP
