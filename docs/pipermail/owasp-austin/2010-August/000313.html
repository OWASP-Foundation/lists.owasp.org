  Topic: Application Assessments Reloaded                                   
                                                                            
  Trying to integrate Business Software Assurance into Enterprise Risk      
  Management and Information Security Management programs has had issues    
  over the years. Penetration-testing was announced dead over a year ago,   
  but it's still the number one choice of application security              
  professionals when starting out. Can the activities from                  
  penetration-testing be re-used and turned into something innovative?      
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Tools (especially application scanners and secure static analysis tools)  
  have error rates so high, they are useless in the hands of newcomers      
  (even for peripheral security testing). Some organizations have built     
  entire applications around or on top of existing appsec tools. Others are 
  looking to use other kinds of tools, such as process/methodology/workflow 
  tools, to enhance their classic penetration-testing tools.                
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Even the testing/inspection methodologies themselves are outdated and     
  we're finding that they are challenging or repetitive in many             
  environments. How do current appsec tools and testing/inspection methods  
  work in the cloud? If we re-run the same kinds of tests during dev-test,  
  software quality, and application security cycles, aren't we wasting      
  valuable time and effort?                                                 
                                                                            
                                                                            
  This presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of     
  these and other challenges in application security. The focus will be on  
  web applications that use common technologies (HTTP, SQL, Classic         
  XML/HTML, Javascript, Flash) but also updated to today's standards        
  (RESTful transactions, NoSQL, HTML5, Ajax/Json, Flex2).                   
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Who: Andre Gironda                                                        
                                                                            
  Andre got his start on Unix-TCP/IP hacking before the September that      
  never ended. Bored of embedded platform research by the time the dot-Bomb 
  happened, he joined the largest online auction company, worked as an      
  appsec consultant for many years, and recently joined a large online      
  gaming company. He is known for his quirky mailing-list posts and blog    
  comments -- and at one time wrote for tssci-security.com.
