<PRE>Hey Austin OWASPers!

On October 29, 2010 our chapter will be putting on the first-ever OWASP 
Regional Conference in Texas!  Although we've made a few mentions of it at 
chapter meetings and such, let this be our first official announcement 
that this conference is not only going to happen, but it is going to ROCK! 
 Sponsorships and CFP submissions continue to roll in on an almost daily 
basis and James and I are getting super excited about giving you what will 
soon become the best application security conference in the state for the 
absolute least amount of money possible.  Here's just a sample of people 
who have already submitted to speak at our conference:

Robert Hansen (CEO of SecTheory, LLC)
Chris Eng (Senior Director of Security Research, Veracode)
Dan Cornell (Principal, Denim Group)
Joe Jarzombek (Director for Software Assurance, Global Cyber Security 
Management, National Cyber Security Division, Department of Homeland 
Security)
Samy Kamkar (Yeah, the &quot;MySpace Worm&quot; Samy)

So here's the deal....conference attendance will be severely restricted 
due to space at the Norris Conference Center.  We've got room for about 
200 attendees and once those seats are sold, you won't be able to buy, 
beg, or cheat your way into the conference.  The good news is that James 
and I are proud to make this the single most affordable conference that 
I've ever heard of.  You get a full day of sessions from a literal &quot;Who's 
Who&quot; of the security industry for a mere $50 if you're already an OWASP 
member or $100 if you're not and that includes membership!  So what are 
you waiting for?  We're giving our Austin OWASPers the first shot at 
buying conference passes, but we can only wait a couple days.  After that, 
well, there's no telling how much longer we'll have available passes. 
Register with the following link:

If you are interested in presenting at the conference, the CFP is open 
through the end of August.  Submit your papers here:

If you or your company is interested in sponsoring this awesome event, we 
still have a bunch of options for you.  Check out our sponsorship page

So there you have it folks...the first-ever OWASP Conference in Texas will 
be in Austin on October 29, 2010.  With quality presenters, affortable 
passes, and an awesome location, you can't go wrong.  Get your pass while 
they last!

Sincerely,
