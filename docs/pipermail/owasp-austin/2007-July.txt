The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin> is an open community dedicated
to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain
applications that can be trusted.  We advocate approaching application
security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most
effective approaches to application security includes improvements in
all of these areas.

 

Each month during our chapter meeting, a subject matter expert will
present and discuss one of the OWASP top 10 topics
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten> . OWASP chapter meetings
are free and open to anyone interested in application security.

Abstract:

Cross Site Request Forgery
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery>  (CSRF)
vulnerabilities occur when applications allow an attacker to force a
victim's browser to make requests detrimental to the victim's interests.
Based on MITRE statistics CSRF vulnerabilities are on the rise, and the
inclusion of CSRF on the updated OWASP Top 10 2007 has cemented their
position as a serious concern for organizations building secure web
applications.  This presentation will examine CSRF vulnerabilities in
detail, using several examples to illustrate their power and impact.  In
addition, safeguard measures will be discussed with code examples in
both Java and .NET.
