Hi all,

Is anyone going to SANS 2007?  (http://www.sans.org/sans2007/)

If we can put together a group of people, then we can get a group discount 
at these rates:

4 - 7 people = 10%
8 - 11 people = 15%
12 or more people = 20%

Please let me know if you are planning on going and I will coordinate with 
you on this.

Best,
James
