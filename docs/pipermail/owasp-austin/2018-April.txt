Subject: [Owasp-austin] Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour - Thursday,

Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu8FaDJW6ME_qewrvqe21=tKZWzj0dANcrNe5jPzLsF0Nw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!



The *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *for April will be *next
week, Thursday, April 12th*.  We will be at Baby A's on Stonelake Blvd in
North Austin.


We want to thank *Cisco *for being our sponsor this month.


Note that we do realize the InfoSec Southwest (ISSW) conference is next
week, but the day and time of our happy hour should not be much of an
overlap with the scheduled events in the evening.


Here are the details:


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for April*

*When:* Thursday, April 12th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where: *Baby A's, 9505-B Stonelake Blvd, Austin, Texas 78759 (corner of
Stonelake and York Blvd, between Hwy 183 and Mopac).  We will meet in the
area inside the restaurant, in the far left corner.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

*Sponsor:* Cisco



Please *RSVP* so that we can get a headcount of how many attendees to
expect:
https://aus-sec-happy-hour-2018-04.eventbrite.com.



Looking forward to seeing you all next week!
