<PRE>Hey Austin OWASPers!

It seems that there has been a lot of discussion within the OWASP Foundation
lately about putting together a community site that has features beyond what
the current wiki provides.  Since our chapter has had some experience
hosting the Ning site, I have volunteered to take this project on and have
put up a proof-of-concept site for the OWASP Foundation.  That said, a
community site is only worth something if the community gets involved and
contributes to it so I'd like it if you all took a moment to go to
<A HREF="http://myowasp.ning.com">http://myowasp.ning.com</A> and created an account.  The super cool thing is
that I've linked it in with Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Yahoo so if you
already maintain an account in any of those places, you can use it here too.

The new site provides a ton of cool features.  Live chat, forums, blogs, RSS
feeds, event calendars, photo albums, video collections, and a ton more.  Be
sure to join the &quot;Austin OWASP&quot; group on there too so that you can
contribute to our own local community within the international one.  Getting
registered is really easy so I hope that all of you will get on and start
contributing today!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
President
Austin OWASP
