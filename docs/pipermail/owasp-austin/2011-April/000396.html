Hello,

Saw your post on the OWASP mailing list, so I thought I'd share my two cents.  Given your background and career aspirations, I would say the CISSP is way too much for what you're looking to do.  CISSP is all-encompassing, folks like to say it's a mile wide but only an inch deep.  So to do that cert you'll have to learn about fences, lighting, fire extinguishers, cryptography (DETAILS!  It's hard), business continuity and DR, etc.  In addition you'll need five years of professional experience to qualify as a CISSP.  You can pass the test and become an &quot;Associate of ISC2&quot; but that's not a CISSP.  Down the road as your career progresses I would say definitely go for the CISSP, in my opinion it's the gold standard of security.

If you're just trying to get a security cert that you can put on a resume, maybe CompTIA Security+ would be a better option. It's broader than just malware but much more manageable than the CISSP without the experience requirements.

If you are really interested in malware analysis, etc, then I'd look to SANS.  They have two courses which could be relevant:

 Reverse-Engineering Malware (Forensics 610)
<A HREF="http://www.sans.org/selfstudy/description.php?tid=4607">http://www.sans.org/selfstudy/description.php?tid=4607</A>


If you're really strong on the coding side, another option is Advanced Exploit Development (Security 710).

<A HREF="http://www.sans.org/selfstudy/description.php?tid=4777">http://www.sans.org/selfstudy/description.php?tid=4777</A>

The thing about SANS though, since you're a student, is that SANS is very expensive.  But like the CISSP, it to me is the gold standard.  I've never taken a SANS course but I have wanted to for the last 10 years at least.  Maybe there are student discounts?


One other avenue to consider is linux certification--the LPI is pretty good I think.  It's not security-specific, but linux is a good place to be right now career-wise.

Anyway, hope this helps.  If you have additional specific questions please let me know and I'll try to assist.  Good luck!

Thanks:)
