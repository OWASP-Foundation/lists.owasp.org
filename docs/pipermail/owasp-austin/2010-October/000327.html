<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers!

Time sure does fly by doesn't it?  I can hardly believe that it's been 
almost a year since I took over as President of the chapter.  This past 
year we've had nine amazing presentations and nine outstanding Happy Hour 
events, but our year is quickly coming to a close.  Historically November 
and December meetings have had relatively low attendance so we've decided 
that instead of trying to force meetings during the holidays we'll have 
one big end-of-year blowout in October.  That blowout is known as the 
Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON).

On October 29, 2010 our OWASP chapter will be holding the first-ever OWASP 
Regional Conference in Texas at the Norris Conference Center here in 
Austin.  We have arranged for three tracks (Technical, Management, and 
OWASP Etc) consisting of some of the best presentations and presenters 
that the world has to offer.  It's a full day of talks (and CPE credits) 
for so cheap your boss won't be able to say anything but &quot;yes&quot; to.  It 
even includes meals, bags (not your usual cheap conference bags either), 
and a kick-ass Happy Hour at the end.  We are at about 70% capacity right 
now with three weeks left until the conference.  Registrations have been 
coming in daily and we do expect it to fill up very soon.  Get your 
conference pass today!

We would like to thank our Gold Sponsors Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, 
Splunk, and Impact Security LLC for their generous support of LASCON and 
enabling us to make it as cheap as possible for all of our attendees.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
