<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

By now I'm sure you've read all of my e-mails about how awesome LASCON 
will be and I'm slowly starting to wear you down.  In fact, our current 
LASCON attendance numbers represent about 56% of the total number of 
people on this mailing list.  That's good, but it's not great and it 
starts to beg the question &quot;What are you waiting for?&quot;  If you've been on 
the fence about whether or not to get your pass to LASCON, I've got three 
pieces of information that will hopefully persuade you to come.

We've decided on the format for the first-ever LASCON Speed Debates and I 
can tell you that this is unlike anything you've ever seen before at a 
conference or elsewhere.  Two teams of three well-known security 
professionals pitted against eachother to argue their case on some of the 
most relevant issues security professionals face today.  Ahead of time, 
they will only be provided with a set of topics of which three will be 
selected for debate.  They will not know whether they are arguing 
affirmative or negative until the debates begin.  I can't tell you how 
excited I am for this event!
&gt;<i>From the beginning, we have been planning our last Happy Hour event of the 
</I>year immediately following LASCON.  We have now officially confirmed that 
the Norris Conference Center will play host to this event.  Even better, 
the bar will open up just before the LASCON Speed Debates mentioned above 
and will go until 7 PM.  Stop by the Denim Group, WhiteHat Security, or 
Radware booths in the Expo Hall in order to get free drink tickets for the 
LASCON bar.
Prices for LASCON registration will go up on Tuesday, October 26, 2010 to 
their final resting place of $200 per conference pass.  This means no more 
student or OWASP member discounts and an additional $50 over the current 
non-Member rate of $150.  It does, however, still include a year 
membership to OWASP ($50 value).  We're getting close to selling out, but 
if passes are still available the day of the conference, $200 is the price 
you can expect to pay at the registration table.  For all you hold outs 
out there, get your LASCON pass today!

See you at LASCON one week from Friday on October 29, 2010!  As always a 
special thanks to our generous LASCON Gold Sponsors Gemalto, WhiteHat 
Security, Splunk, and Impact Security LLC!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
