<PRE>One thing about hackathons or code-a-thons is security often gets
overlooked, so if anyone wants to join us...

Just a reminder that the Austin News Hackathon is a week from tomorrow,
October 16. Please sign up if you haven't already:

 When is it?

   - Saturday, October 16, 9am-4:30pm

 Where is it?

   - Austin Community College&#8217;s terrific Eastview Campus
   - 3401 Webberville Road, Building 8000

 Who should come?

   - Journalists, bloggers, and other strong writers and communicators who
   understand the power of technology, but don&#8217;t know where to start in taking
   raw data and transforming it into newsworthy information.
   - Technology developers looking for an opportunity to build meaningful,
   worldchanging solutions. We also need designers and technical writers to
   help design and document the applications we build.
   - Government employees and officials who want to spread the word about
   the data they've already released, and learn what is necessary to provide
   the most useful data to the public.

 What is it?

The Hackathon is a collaboration of newsy people who understand
communication and nerdy people who understand application development.
Collaborative teams will conceive and define data-driven news applications,
and build real, workable open source solutions that transform raw data into
headline news.
 What will we do?

   - The plan is to identify publicly-available, readily accessible data
   sets &#8211; see <A HREF="http://www.texastransparency.org/opendata/">http://www.texastransparency.org/opendata/</A>
   - Journalists and bloggers will brainstorm with technology developers,
   creating ideas for applications using the available data, and building those
   applications.
   - This partnership of people who develop news and people who develop
   technology will produce workable applications that will be placed online for
   the anyone to see and use.
   - At the end of the day, judges will select the best applications. &#8226;
   Bring your computer, we&#8217;ll have great wifi. What will you take away?
   - Communicators will have a better appreciation and understanding of
   technology and the process of application development.
   - Developers will learn much more about the news ecosystem, and how to
   find meaning and value in increasingly available data sets.
   - Everybody will learn how to build stories and deliver news in a world
   of pervasive digital convergence. The ultimate deliverable is a
   better-informed society

 Schedule

9:00am: Arrive and meet people.

9:15am: Welcome messages by Cindy Royal and Jon Lebkowsky.

9:30am: Matt Stiles and Niran Babalola will talk about their work building
news applications at the Texas Tribune, giving a few examples and creating
inspiration for the day&#8217;s work. As part of their presentation, they&#8217;ll
review the data sets available at <A HREF="http://www.texastransparency.org/opendata/">http://www.texastransparency.org/opendata/</A>

10:15am: Break

10:30am: Following that presentation, we&#8217;ll ask journalists, bloggers, and
other communicators to spend some time meeting, caffeinating, talking, and
coming up with ideas for applications.

11:00am: Those who have specific application ideas will present them to the
group, and invite application developers to work with them. Teams will form,
define requirements, and build applications.

11:30am: Teams work on application development

12:30pm: Lunch (from Pick Up Stix, sponsored by Community Impact) and
conversation

1:15pm: Teams work on application development

3:15pm: Teams will present their applications and get feedback. Then we&#8217;ll
debrief, and have an open, informed discussion about the development
process.

4:30pm: Head to happy hour (venue TBA)!
Quoting organizers of the New York OpenSourceAThon: &#8220;Our goal is to put the
finishing touches on, and release as much great open source software for

testing, and documentation writing.&#8221;
