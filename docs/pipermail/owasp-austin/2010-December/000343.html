<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

Are any of you a whiz at graphic design?  Think the logo for LASCON 2010 
was lame and you can do better?  Let's put your money where your mouth is 
and make it happen.  We need two designs for LASCON 2011:

1) We need a new conference logo.  This logo will be 
everywhere....conference booklets, signs, promo materials, websites, etc. 

2) We need LASCON 2011 T-shirts.  Last year's design (done by me of 
course) was a huge hit, but we want to have different T-shirts every year. 
 The three best designs will be selected.  Get creative.  No design is too 
over the top here.

The selected logo and T-shirt designers will each receive a complimentary 
full conference pass to LASCON 2011 at the Norris Conference Center on 
October 28, 2011.  They will also each receive a $50 gift certificate good 
for a purchase at the conference OWASP store.  Take this nice long holiday 
break to get busy designing and send your submissions to 
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">josh.sokol at owasp.org.</A>  Submissions for the conference logo are due by 
March 1, 2011 and submissions for the T-shirt design are due by June 1, 
2011.  Let's see what you got!

--------------------------------------

On a side note, Alberto sent me a note on a job opening at St. Edwards 
that he thought you guys might be interested in:
