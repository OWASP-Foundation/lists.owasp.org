Subject: [Owasp-austin] January 2017 Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour
Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu86n9RtV23GQs7C9NwYaf93rNUa0Vp6NLHxF63y_sbsTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone and Happy 2017!
First, apologies for such a late notice on the particulars of this month's
Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, which is Thursday of next week.
Here are the details:

*When:*  Thursday, January 12th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where:* Sherlock?s Baker St. Pub & Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd).  We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

*Sponsors:* We are pleased to have two sponsors for this event - Bugcrowd
and Rapid7

Bugcrowd:

*An innovator in crowdsourced security testing for the enterprise, Bugcrowd
harnesses the power of more than 19,000 security researchers to surface
critical software vulnerabilities. Bugcrowd provides a range of
vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs that allow organizations
to commission a customized security testing program that fits their needs.*

you need to dramatically reduce threat exposure and detect compromise in
real-time. They speed investigations so you can halt threats and clean up
