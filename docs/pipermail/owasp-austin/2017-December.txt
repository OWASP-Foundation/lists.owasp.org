Subject: [Owasp-austin] Invitation to Austin Security Groups Holiday
 Mixer (Monday, Dec 11, 2017)
Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu-L1yaZPx6VH=mC8R7XWB7L8-G78RHvqb25rQms9ZN-XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I wanted to pass along some additional information about the upcoming
holiday mixer.

This event will require that you bring proof of your Eventbrite
registration, either a printed ticket or electronically available on your
phone.  There will be a check-in desk where you will need to sign in, which
is a requirement by Indeed.

Just thought you should know, if you plan to attend.

Thanks,

Tiana Chandler
