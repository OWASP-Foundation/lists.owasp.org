 Please note that we decided *not* to have the study group this Wednesday
(today) due to the ISSA meeting on the same day and time.  This was posted
on the study group?s myowasp.ning.com thread last Thursday (
http://myowasp.ning.com/forum/topics/study-group-web-application-defender-s-cookbook-modsecurity?groupUrl=austinowaspstudygroup&groupId=6390588%3AGroup%3A2403&id=6390588%3ATopic%3A15629&page=3#comments).
We will continue next week, Wednesday, January 29th.  And most likely, for
the next several months, we may skip the study group meeting for the week
when the monthly ISSA meeting occurs, depending upon how many of the study
group participants would be attending ISSA.  Basically we do not want to
have a study group meeting if we know we may only get two or three
attendees (would be counter-productive).


As a reminder, the OWASP Study Group is currently covering the book ?*Web
Application Defender's Cookbook: Battling Hackers and Protecting Users?.  *The
study group meets on Wednesdays at National Instruments, Building A, Room
217 from 12:00 to 1:00 PM.  For more details, including any meeting update

Austin OWASPers,

Because of safety concerns due to the icy weather and the bad conditions on
the Austin roads, it is with regret that we are canceling today's chapter
meeting.  We are investigating alternate dates and times, but we may just
not meet until February.

Joel Scambray's presentation will have to be rescheduled to a future date.

Sorry for the cancellation, but stay safe out there.
