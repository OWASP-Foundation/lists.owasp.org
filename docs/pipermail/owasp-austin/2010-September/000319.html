<PRE>Hello Texas OWASPers!

After a long and difficult RFP selection process, the LASCON planning 
committee has come to an agreement on the presentations for the first-ever 
Lonestar Application Security Conference.  The conference will be held at 
the Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX on Friday, October 29, 2010. 
Registrations are $50 for OWASP members and $100 for Non-Members which 
includes a year of OWASP membership.  We have extended the registration 
discount deadline for one additional week to give you all a chance to look 
over the speaker list, but after 9/24 the price goes up by $50 assuming 
they are still available.  We are well over halfway to our targeted 
registration number and are closing in fast on selling out.  Register 
today at:
