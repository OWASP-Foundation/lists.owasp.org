<PRE>Hey Josh,

Great pitch to get people signed up!  I'm not registered yet but maybe
today ... plus the debates sound awesome!  I did Lincoln-Douglas debate
in high school, and that sounds like a really cool, fun idea.  I've got
to get registered!!  PS--for the debates, don't forget
&quot;cross-examination&quot;--that is the best part!

Later,
Matt S.

Well over 100 people have registered so far for the Lonestar Application

Security Conference (LASCON) happening in Austin on October 29, 2010,
but 
are you one of them?  We are well on our way to our goal of selling this

thing out and if you're stalling, you might just miss your opportunity
to 
see 20 of the country's top security minds for as low as 30$!  If you 
haven't registered at this point, what are you waiting for?  After
today, 
the early-bird discount ends and prices go up.  But you're thrifty,
right? 
 You know a good deal when  you see one.  Certainly you want to be &quot;in
the 
know&quot; on Monday when everyone around the water cooler is talking about
how 
Samy met your girlfriend, don't you?  And don't forget that you still
need 
to get more CPEs before the end of the year.  Your security peers from
all 
around the state are attending LASCON and you should too!

Registration is easy.  Just go to <A HREF="http://guest.cvent.com/d/vdqf7g/4W">http://guest.cvent.com/d/vdqf7g/4W</A> and

enter your name and e-mail address.  Tell us whether you're an OWASP 
member or not (we do validate against the OWASP membership list).  If
not, 
you pay an extra $50 which is just the cost of a full year of OWASP 
membership.  Enter your credit card number.  Done.  Now we'll see you at

the Norris Conference Center in just over a month!

In case you haven't seen it yet, here's a big list of everyone who is 
presenting at LASCON:

Keynote
Matt Tesauro (OWASP Foundation Board Member)

Technical Track
James Flom (COO, Co-Founder, SecTheory) - Why ha.ckers.org Doesn't Get 
Hacked
Dan Cornell (Principal, Denim Group) - Smart Phones with Dumb Apps:
Threat 
Modeling for Mobile Applications
Chris Eng (Director of Security Research, Veracode) - Deconstructing 
ColdFusion
Robert Hansen (CEO, Founder, SecTheory) and Josh Sokol (Information 
Security Program Owner, National Instruments) - HTTPS Can Byte Me
Samy &quot;MySpace Worm&quot; Kamkar (Co-Founder, Director of Engineering,
Fonality, 
Inc.) - How I Met Your Girlfriend

Management Track
Charlie Scott and Jay Paz (Information Security Office, UT Austin) -

Assessment

Dept of Homeland Security) - Mitigating Business Risks with Application

Karen Lu and Asad Ali (Gemalto) - Enhancing Web Application Security
Using 
Another Factor
Charles Henderson and David Byrne (Trustwave) - Anatomy of a Logic Flaw

Speed Debates
We're still working on the rules, but effectively two security 
professionals will be selected to square off against eachother in a
debate 
on a relevant security topic.  We will assign an affirmative and a 
negative and give them each a short period of time to persuade the
judges 
that they are right.  The judges will vote and we will determine a
winner 
for the debate.  The debates will feature many of our esteemed LASCON 
presenters and maybe even YOU?!?!

For more information on LASCON, please see our website at 
<A HREF="http://www.lascon.org.">http://www.lascon.org.</A>  As always, we would like to thank our generous 
gold sponsors Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, Splunk, and Impact Security,
LLC 
for helping to make LASCON the best application security conference in 
Texas.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
Information Security Program Owner
