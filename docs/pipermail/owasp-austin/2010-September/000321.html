  Topic: Technology and Business Risk Management: How Application Security  
  Fits In                                                                   
                                                                            
                                                                            
  This presentation demonstrates how important application security is to   
  the overall stability and security of the infrastructure and the          
  ultimately, the business. Presented from the Information Security         
  Officer/Risk Manager point of view, it shows how a strong information     
  security program reduces levels of reputational, operational, legal, and  
  strategic risk by limiting vulnerabilities, increasing stability, and     
  maintaining customer confidence and trust. It focuses on the top concerns 
  of risk managers and how application security fits into the overall risk  
  management process. The audience will be given recommendations on how to  
  improve cost effectiveness and efficiency to achieve business, security,  
  audit, and compliance objectives relative to applications.
