Topic: Technology and Business Risk Management: How Application Security
Fits In


This presentation demonstrates how important application security is to the
overall stability and security of the infrastructure and the ultimately,
the business. Presented from the Information Security Officer/Risk Manager
point of view, it shows how a strong information security program reduces
levels of reputational, operational, legal, and strategic risk by limiting
vulnerabilities, increasing stability, and maintaining customer confidence
and trust. It focuses on the top concerns of risk managers and how
application security fits into the overall risk management process. The
audience will be given recommendations on how to improve cost effectiveness
and efficiency to achieve business, security, audit, and compliance
objectives relative to applications.
