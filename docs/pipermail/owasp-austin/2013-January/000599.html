&gt;<i> *January  OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *When*: January 29th, 11:45am-1:00pm
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 11:45 AM - Chapter Announcements
</I>&gt;<i> 12:00 PM - Presentation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Topic:* Data events, or why security is cloudier than you think
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data security doesn't involve just securing data at rest or in transit. It
</I>&gt;<i> also needs to be secured in use &#173; which means that at any point, the
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics of the data can change. We call this situation a &quot;data
</I>&gt;<i> event,&quot; and it can mean that security requirements have to change as a
</I>&gt;<i> result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not the same thing as logging event data; this is taking into
</I>&gt;<i> account changes in the combination, use or business context surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> specific data. For example, a press release is confidential and requires a
</I>&gt;<i> certain set of security policies in the areas of access control, DLP, key
</I>&gt;<i> management (if encryption is involved), and so on. But once the business
</I>&gt;<i> event occurs, the press release suddenly becomes the opposite of
</I>&gt;<i> confidential, and all the policies have to change immediately as a result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data events can also occur when data elements are combined in particular
</I>&gt;<i> ways so that they become covered by regulations. A query might produce a
</I>&gt;<i> small enough sample size that it needs to be treated as protected
</I>&gt;<i> information, or a doctor becomes a patient so that her name is now
</I>&gt;<i> protected by HIPAA. Data events are often tied closely to the business
</I>&gt;<i> context, and as such can mirror transactions and workflows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data events are important because traditional security policies have been
</I>&gt;<i> applied to the current container of the data: this database is confidential
</I>&gt;<i> because some rows are confidential, or this Word document requires access
</I>&gt;<i> control (but its content can be copied and pasted somewhere else).
</I>&gt;<i> Container-centric security is too static for today's high-speed, big-data,
</I>&gt;<i> cloud-based (pick as many buzzwords as you like) processing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This talk will describe the concept of data events, and will invite
</I>&gt;<i> audience discussion on how security controls can be adapted to them.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> **Speakers: *Wendy Nather
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Wendy Nather *is Research Director of the 451 Research Enterprise
</I>&gt;<i> Security Practice. With over 20 years of IT experience, she built and
</I>&gt;<i> managed the IT security program at the Texas Education Agency, where she
</I>&gt;<i> directed multimillion-dollar initiatives for a statewide external user base
</I>&gt;<i> of over 50,000. She also provided security guidance for the datacenter
</I>&gt;<i> consolidation of 27 Texas state agencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wendy previously worked in various roles in the investment banking
</I>&gt;<i> division of Swiss Bank Corp (now UBS). Based in Chicago, Zurich and London,
</I>&gt;<i> she also served as the first IT Security Director for the EMEA region. She
</I>&gt;<i> has spoken at various industry conferences in the US and abroad, and
</I>&gt;<i> co-authored The Cloud Security Rules. She was also named one of Tripwire
</I>&gt;<i> Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;Top 25 Influencers in Security.&#8221;
