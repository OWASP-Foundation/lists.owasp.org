<PRE>I'm told that in addition to Trusteer sponsoring our food and drinks, they
will also be giving away a brand new iPad at Thursday night's Austin
Security Professionals Happy Hour.  Be sure to bring your business card to
get entered in the drawing!  Odds of winning should be fantastic!

</I>&gt;<i> January OWASP Chapter Meeting - &quot;**Data events, or why security is
</I>&gt;<i> cloudier than you think&quot; - Wendy Nather
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *When:* January 29th from 11:30a - 1:00p
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Who:* Wendy Nather
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wendy Nather is Research Director of the 451 Research Enterprise Security
</I>&gt;<i> Practice. With over 20 years of IT experience, she built and managed the IT
</I>&gt;<i> security program at the Texas Education Agency, where she directed
</I>&gt;<i> multimillion-dollar initiatives for a statewide external user base of over
</I>&gt;<i> 50,000. She also provided security guidance for the datacenter
</I>&gt;<i> consolidation of 27 Texas state agencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wendy previously worked in various roles in the investment banking
</I>&gt;<i> division of Swiss Bank Corp (now UBS). Based in Chicago, Zurich and London,
</I>&gt;<i> she also served as the first IT Security Director for the EMEA region. She
</I>&gt;<i> has spoken at various industry conferences in the US and abroad, and
</I>&gt;<i> co-authored The Cloud Security Rules. She was also named one of Tripwire
</I>&gt;<i> Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;Top 25 Influencers in Security.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Topic:* Data events, or why security is cloudier than you think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Abstract:* Data security doesn't involve just securing data at rest or
</I>&gt;<i> in transit. It also needs to be secured in use &#173; which means that at any
</I>&gt;<i> point, the characteristics of the data can change. We call this situation a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;data event,&quot; and it can mean that security requirements have to change as
</I>&gt;<i> a result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not the same thing as logging event data; this is taking into
</I>&gt;<i> account changes in the combination, use or business context surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> specific data. For example, a press release is confidential and requires a
</I>&gt;<i> certain set of security policies in the areas of access control, DLP, key
</I>&gt;<i> management (if encryption is involved), and so on. But once the business
</I>&gt;<i> event occurs, the press release suddenly becomes the opposite of
</I>&gt;<i> confidential, and all the policies have to change immediately as a result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data events can also occur when data elements are combined in particular
</I>&gt;<i> ways so that they become covered by regulations. A query might produce a
</I>&gt;<i> small enough sample size that it needs to be treated as protected
</I>&gt;<i> information, or a doctor becomes a patient so that her name is now
</I>&gt;<i> protected by HIPAA. Data events are often tied closely to the business
</I>&gt;<i> context, and as such can mirror transactions and workflows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Data events are important because traditional security policies have been
</I>&gt;<i> applied to the current container of the data: this database is confidential
</I>&gt;<i> because some rows are confidential, or this Word document requires access
</I>&gt;<i> control (but its content can be copied and pasted somewhere else).
</I>&gt;<i> Container-centric security is too static for today's high-speed, big-data,
</I>&gt;<i> cloud-based (pick as many buzzwords as you like) processing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This talk will describe the concept of data events, and will invite
</I>&gt;<i> audience discussion on how security controls can be adapted to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Food:* Oh yeah, Taco Deli time! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have
</I>&gt;<i> enough for all! Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any
</I>&gt;<i> drawings/giveaways that may take place!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Location:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *RSVP:* <A HREF="http://owaspjanuary.eventbrite.com/">http://owaspjanuary.eventbrite.com/</A>

</I>&gt;<i> *************************************************

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *OWASP Study Group*
</I>&gt;<i>  We meet every Wednesday from 12:00p-1:00p at National Instruments
</I>&gt;<i> Building A on the second floor in one of the large conference rooms. Paul
</I>&gt;<i> Griffiths, our Vice President, has been guiding these meetings. We are
</I>&gt;<i> still finishing up &quot;Metasploit: the Penetration Tester's Guide&quot; by Dave
</I>&gt;<i> Kennedy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  It's a great networking opportunity and you just might learn something in
</I>&gt;<i> the process and teach others as well!
