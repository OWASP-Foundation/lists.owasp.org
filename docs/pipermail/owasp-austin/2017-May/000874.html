*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for May*

When: Tuesday, May 30th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Title: Annoying web app vulnerabilities: HTTP Request Smuggling, HTTP
Response Splitting and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Misconfigurations.

     Part 1:

Abstract: HTTP Request Smuggling is an attack capable of bypassing security
protections and &quot;poisoning the well&quot; for caching web proxies. In this talk
we'll be discussing attack scenarios and their security implications.

Speaker: Gabriel has been actively involved in the security industry since
2007 and currently holds the position of security analyst at Rapid7.


     Part 2:

Abstract: HTTP Response Splitting is a web application vulnerability that
is often misunderstood, but can lead to a serious compromise. This talk
will walk through the basics of Response Splitting, how an attack works,
and what you can do to defend against it.

Speaker: Ben Columbus is a security analyst for Rapid7, who specializes in
network and web application penetration testing. He has been working in
security for the last eight years in various positions and was previously a
penetration tester for the State of Texas.


     Part 3:

Abstract: The talk will provide information about headers used for
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and how servers use these headers to
communicate access policy to browsers. The possible security implications
of misconfigured CORS headers will be discussed.

Speaker: Jacob enjoys learning about security vulnerabilities and their
usage in the real world.
