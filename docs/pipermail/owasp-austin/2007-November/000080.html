<PRE>
I thought I'd use this list for a little discussion to get people's juices
flowing!

So, question.  I have a Web site that needs to integrate its custom login
procedures with various ASPs - in other words, we have a Web site login.
As we &quot;outsource&quot; parts of our Web site, we want users to be able to log in
and go to site sections really hosted on ASPs and be &quot;logged in&quot;.

What's the &quot;industry standard&quot; secure ways of doing this?  I have
programmers talking about all kinds of crazy solutions; spoofing setting of
cookies, puting junk in URLs, etc.  I'm not sure what the canonical
solution is...

   Assume that the site and the ASP have different but fairly-standard
   login schemes (set a cookie, etc.)
   Assume that it could be the first time the ASP's heard of the user; the
   site doesn't pump all its user data to each partner proactively (meaning
   some data transfer needs to take place at the time).

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Ernest
