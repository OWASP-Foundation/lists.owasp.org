<PRE>Howdy folks,

OWASP Monthly Meeting -- next on Tuesday -- January 27th!

CryptoParty!

In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'
where he stated &quot;We are creating a world that all may enter without
privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or
station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may
express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being
coerced into silence or conformity.&quot; The Internet of today is an amazing
place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr.
Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to
to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy
and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.
CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these
solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to
privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR,
full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend,
public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 27, 2015 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first ever
CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about
the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy. We
encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this
event. Presentations will be laid out so that novice and experienced alike
can take action based on the data presented. All tools presented will be
free and open source. Our CryptoParty will end with the first-ever OWASP
Austin Key Signing Party. Don't miss this meeting and be sure to invite
your friends!

Speaker: Several ! -- Lead by Josh Sokol

--
If you have a PGP key and would like to participate in our key
signing party after the presentations, we recommend that you bring your ID
for others to check.

Ideally, also bring pieces of paper (business cards??) to hand out
that list at least your key ID and fingerprint -- this speeds up the
process of recording this kind of information when validating a party-goers
ID.

For those new to PGP, we will provide an introduction at the CryptoParty.
If you can't wait until then and want to get started with generating your
own key to bring to the party, you can find the home of the free
implementation of OpenPGP (including How-To's, etc.) with links to source
code and operating system-specific installation packages here:
