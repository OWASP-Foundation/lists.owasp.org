<PRE>I literally just had the most interesting phone call that I've ever taken.
A man called telling me that they had detected errors coming from my
computer. I immediately stopped him, told him he was trying to scam me, and
told him that I do security for a living. He immediately said &quot;You got me&quot;
and then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with me about what he
does, who he is, and why he does it. His real name was Baroon and he is
from Uganda. He told me that he will take the user into their Event Viewer
and show them the errors there to make them think that there's a problem
with their system. Once they see that, he will offer to help them and have
them launch a session with them. They will offer to fix it for $300 (which
he said is far less than some of the scammers who charge $2k). He first
told me that it's the persons fault for being stupid, but then shared with
me that he knows it's wrong and he is interviewing and trying to change
jobs. I told him that I appreciated his honesty and I wished him well with
his search for a more reputable job. Crazy.
