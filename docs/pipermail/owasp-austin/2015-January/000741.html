<PRE>Howdy Austin OWASPers!

We are back!!  Our winter slumber is over and OWASP Austin is back!  Our
events kick off next week and we look forward to seeing everyone in this
new year.

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by FishNet Security --
next week on January 8th!

Fishnet will be supplying a giveaway!

When:  Thursday, January 8th, 5pm-7pm

Where: Sherlocks Baker Street Pub and Grill, 183 &amp; Burnet (we meet in the
large room to the right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the
room.)

What: The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

Sponsor:   FishNet Security

OWASP Monthly Meeting -- next on January 27th!

CryptoParty!

In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'
where he stated &quot;We are creating a world that all may enter without
privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or
station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may
express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being
coerced into silence or conformity.&quot; The Internet of today is an amazing
place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr.
Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to
to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy
and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.
CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these
solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to
privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR,
full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend,
public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 27, 2015 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first ever
CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about
the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy. We
encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this
event. Presentations will be laid out so that novice and experienced alike
can take action based on the data presented. All tools presented will be
free and open source. Our CryptoParty will end with the first-ever OWASP
Austin Key Signing Party. Don't miss this meeting and be sure to invite
your friends!
