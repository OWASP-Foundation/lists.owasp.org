<PRE>This happened to me about a year ago as well. &quot;Oh really? These errors just
started?&quot; I said. He said he was going to help me and proceeded to instruct
me to click on the &quot;Start&quot; button. &quot;Are you sure? I don't have a 'Start'
button.&quot; I said. &quot;It should be at the bottom left corner of your screen,&quot;
he said. &quot;I use Linux.&quot; He hung up.

</I>&gt;<i> I literally just had the most interesting phone call that I've ever taken.
</I>&gt;<i> A man called telling me that they had detected errors coming from my
</I>&gt;<i> computer. I immediately stopped him, told him he was trying to scam me, and
</I>&gt;<i> told him that I do security for a living. He immediately said &quot;You got me&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with me about what he
</I>&gt;<i> does, who he is, and why he does it. His real name was Baroon and he is
</I>&gt;<i> from Uganda. He told me that he will take the user into their Event Viewer
</I>&gt;<i> and show them the errors there to make them think that there's a problem
</I>&gt;<i> with their system. Once they see that, he will offer to help them and have
</I>&gt;<i> them launch a session with them. They will offer to fix it for $300 (which
</I>&gt;<i> he said is far less than some of the scammers who charge $2k). He first
</I>&gt;<i> told me that it's the persons fault for being stupid, but then shared with
</I>&gt;<i> me that he knows it's wrong and he is interviewing and trying to change
</I>&gt;<i> jobs. I told him that I appreciated his honesty and I wished him well with
</I>&gt;<i> his search for a more reputable job. Crazy.
