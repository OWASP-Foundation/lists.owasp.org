<PRE>That&#8217;s awesome. One of my clients happened to get a call from a scammer like that while I was onsite, so he told the scammer, &#8220;Oh really? My IT support is right here. You want to talk to him?&#8221; The scammer just told him, &#8220;fuck you!&#8221; and hung up.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Phone Call Today (Too good not to share)

I literally just had the most interesting phone call that I've ever taken. A man called telling me that they had detected errors coming from my computer. I immediately stopped him, told him he was trying to scam me, and told him that I do security for a living. He immediately said &quot;You got me&quot; and then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with me about what he does, who he is, and why he does it. His real name was Baroon and he is from Uganda. He told me that he will take the user into their Event Viewer and show them the errors there to make them think that there's a problem with their system. Once they see that, he will offer to help them and have them launch a session with them. They will offer to fix it for $300 (which he said is far less than some of the scammers who charge $2k). He first told me that it's the persons fault for being stupid, but then shared with me that he knows it's wrong and he is interviewing and trying to change jobs. I told him that I appreciated his honesty and I wished him well with his search for a more reputable job. Crazy.
