<PRE>Happy February everyone!


Last month we had a great turnout for our monthly meeting!  While there
were a few miscues :/, I have taken those as lessons-learned and will do my
best to ensure it goes more smoothly this next time.


This month's OWASP Austin Chapter meeting will be on Tuesday, February 23,
2016.  *Please RSVP on Eventbrite
&lt;<A HREF="http://owasp-austin-2016-february.eventbrite.com">http://owasp-austin-2016-february.eventbrite.com</A>&gt; by noon on Friday,
February 19th,* so I can then place the order for the food.  I want to be
sure I have ordered enough food this time for everyone.


Following are the details of the meeting:


OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, February 23rd from 11:30
AM to 1:00 PM


*Rugged DevOps Using Gauntlt*


Writing code that works is hard. Writing rugged code that can stand the
test of time is even harder. This difficulty is often compounded by
crunched timelines and fast cycles that prioritize new features. Add in
evolving business needs and new technology and it becomes confusing to know
what to do and how to integrate security into your application.


This workshop brings in some of the top developers and application security
practitioners to help you ruggedize your end-to-end development lifecycle
from code commit to running system.


Three Takeaways:

   1. You will learn pragmatic approaches and tooling that will affect your
   development processes and delivery pipelines.
   2. Armed with tools and ideas for monitoring your operational and
   runtime security.
   3. You will walk away with code examples and tools that you can put into
   practice right away for security and rugged testing.

Bring a laptop (mac or linux) that you can install software on and a github
account.

*Other Reminders --*


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *


Just a reminder, this month's Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is *next
week, Thursday, February 18th*.  Normally it would have been this week, but
due to conflict with other planned events at Sherlock's, we had to change
it for this month.  Hopefully no one will show up tomorrow at Sherlock's
and looking for the rest of us. :)

*OWASP Study Group*

The OWASP Study Group continues to meet on Thursdays at the same location
and meeting room at NI from 12-1pm.  The current
