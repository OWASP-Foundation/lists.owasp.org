<PRE>Hello Everyone!


This month&#8217;s Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour will be on Thursday,
February 18, 2016.  We will be at Sherlock's Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill at 183
and Burnet.  Please note the date, as it is on a different week than normal.


&#8212;&#8212;


Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Rapid7


*When:*  Thursday, February 18th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm


*Where: *Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd).  We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.


*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.


*Sponsor:* Rapid7


*Rapid7 is engineering better security with simple, innovative solutions
for IT security's most critical challenges. Our security data and analytics
solutions collect, contextualize, correlate, and analyze the security data
you need to dramatically reduce threat exposure and detect compromise in
real-time. They speed investigations so you can halt threats and clean up
systems fast. Plus, our analytics give you the specific information you
need to systematically improve security processes within your organization.
Unlike traditional vulnerability assessment or incident management,
Rapid7's comprehensive data collection, attacker intelligence and
user-behavior analytics give you immediate insight into the security state
of your assets and users from the endpoint to the cloud. We offer unmatched
capabilities to spot intruders leveraging today's #1 attack vector,
compromised credentials. Our ability to help goes beyond our innovative
technology. Rapid7 security experts can help you advance your security
program, whether you need emergency breach response or to transform your
security processes and better align investments to your organization's risk
and needs. Rapid7 is trusted by more than 4,150 organizations across 90
countries, including 34% of the Fortune 1000. Our products are top rated by
Gartner&#174;, Forrester&#174; and SC Magazine. For more information about Rapid7,
