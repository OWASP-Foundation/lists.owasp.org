Message-ID: <CAFwvDey5DigJiktMgam50ETZAbmW0u=_XQzW7BBzLui37B9t2w@mail.gmail.com>

OWASP Austin,

I was approached by the Austin ISSA Chapter to do a training on my
SimpleRisk project and risk management basics and we finally have scheduled
a half-day event in the afternoon on Thursday, May 1st.  It is $10 to
register, but the full amount will be refunded to you provided that you
attend the training.  That means that in reality, this training is FREE.
This opportunity is limited to the first 50 people who sign up and you do
not have to be an ISSA member to register.  Details follow below.

Risk Management Like a Boss: Making Your Risks Work for You


*Join Austin ISSA for a half day Advanced Training Session with renowned
Information Security Management Expert Josh Sokol.*
*Thursday, May 1st, 1 - 4:30pm* *A laptop with wireless card is required!*  $10
Admission, pre-registration required

*(Admission fee will be refunded to all pre-registered attendees that sign
up before the early registration deadline!)*

*Abstract:*

Arguably, the single most valuable skill that you can learn in Information
Security today in order to improve your security posture for tomorrow is
Risk Management. The simple process of identifying your risks, planning
your mitigations, and performing reviews puts your company squarely in the
drivers seat when it comes to justifying its security expenditures in order
to reduce risk. SimpleRisk is the only free and open source alternative to
the bloated and expensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platforms
out there and is being used by corporations of all sizes, around the world,
to perform their risk management activities. During this half-day seminar,
Josh Sokol, the Creator of SimpleRisk, will walk attendees through the
basics of risk management using hands-on activities and the SimpleRisk
tool. By the end of the course, attendees will have the knowledge necessary
in order to deploy SimpleRisk in their environment, use it to manage their
risks, and have a firm grasp on the processes involved in managing risks.

*Josh's Biography:*

Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a
BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several
large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a
military contractor, and is currently employed as the Information Security
Program Owner at National Instruments. In his current role, Sokol manages
all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability
management activities for NI. Sokol created the free and open source risk
management tool named SimpleRisk, has spoken on dozens of security topics
including the much-hyped "HTTPSCan Byte Me" talk at Black Hat 2010, and
currently serves on the OWASP Global Board of Directors.

Be sure to reserve your spot for this half-day training event now! Seats
will fill up quickly and space is limited. The cost of attendance is
*$10 *which
will be refunded if you register early and make the event.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Austin Study Group - survey for next topic
Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu-2Uqr790KZp68R_i4y1pxs77em_BByGS=zx_fVRj0tfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP Austin!

Some of you are familiar with the OWASP Austin Study Group, while others
may have only heard a little bit about it. The OWASP Austin Study Group is
a gathering of mostly IT security professionals, meeting on a weekly basis,
to learn and discuss topics related to IT security, with goal to share in a
learning experience to enhance their skills and knowledge. The group has
just finished studying the book *Web Application Defender's Cookbook:
Battling Hackers and Protecting Users*, and is working to identify the next
topic.

A survey has been created to obtain votes on the next study group topic. If
you can take the time between now and the end of the week (Friday, April
25), please visit the survey and provide your input.  It will ask for a
ranking of five topics that have been mentioned the most as topics of
interest:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7WWR29H

Tentative start date will be mid May, depending upon response to poll/vote
and time needed to obtain any book required.

A few notes:

While the study group is affiliated with OWASP and the OWASP Austin
chapter, there is no requirement to be an OWASP member.  However, you may
find there are more benefits with being a member.  For more information on
the Austin Chapter and link to becoming a member, see
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin.

To help with collaborating on the study group topics, we currently use Ning
discussion forums. If you wish to participate in future study group topics,
or at minimum to keep track of what is going on and perhaps provide
feedback, then please sign up and join the group at
http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austinowaspstudygroup.

Some topics have been suggested related to studying for specific
certifications.  The thought on this is that it would be too specific for a
general study group.  Instead, the best approach would be to coordinate a
separate group of those who are interested in obtaining the certification,
where one or two of those in that group would organize the meeting time and
meeting place.  As the Training/Study Coordinator, I would be happy to help
facilitate the start-up of a "Certification Study Group".   Just let me
know.


If you have any questions about the study group, please feel free to
contact me.

Thanks!

Hello Austin OWASPers!

I can't believe it has already been a month since Bsides and the March
meeting.  The happy hour was a great event and more are upcoming!

-------

The monthly chapter meeting will be a great one for hacking enthusiasts and
those especially interested in the Raspberry Pi.  If anyone else saw
Branden at BSides last month, you know he is a great speaker with awesome
hacks.

*OWASP Monthly meeting on April 29th: *
*11:30 - 1 (really 11:45 - 1, we gotta eat sometime)*

*Title: **Covert Hacking and Application Testing with Raspberry Pi*

*Abstract: *The $35 Raspberry Pi is a wonder device on the cheap! But the
security impact of this cheap and powerful equipment with its tiny
footprint is equally interesting. In this session you will learn how the Pi
can be used as a covert, field-friendly hacking platform for less than $100

Risk Management Like a Boss: Making Your Risks Work for You
Thursday, May 1st, 1-4:30 PM at the Norris Conference Center

Abstract:

Arguably, the single most valuable skill that you can learn in Information
Security today in order to improve your security posture for tomorrow is
Risk Management. The simple process of identifying your risks, planning
your mitigations, and performing reviews puts your company squarely in the
drivers seat when it comes to justifying its security expenditures in order
to reduce risk. SimpleRisk is the only free and open source alternative to
the bloated and expensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platforms
out there and is being used by corporations of all sizes, around the world,
to perform their risk management activities. During this half-day seminar,
Josh Sokol, the Creator of SimpleRisk, will walk attendees through the
basics of risk management using hands-on activities and the SimpleRisk
tool. By the end of the course, attendees will have the knowledge necessary
in order to deploy SimpleRisk in their environment, use it to manage their
risks, and have a firm grasp on the processes involved in managing risks.

Josh's Biography:


Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a
BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several

Program Owner at National Instruments. In his current role, Sokol manages
all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability
management activities for NI. Sokol created the free and open source risk
management tool named SimpleRisk, has spoken on dozens of security topics
