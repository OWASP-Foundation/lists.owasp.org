Subject: [Owasp-austin] New OWASP Foundation Community Site
Message-ID: <BANLkTinMSTpU+JCV5d02yHX5TN9FBzcuEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Austin OWASPers!

It seems that there has been a lot of discussion within the OWASP Foundation
lately about putting together a community site that has features beyond what
the current wiki provides.  Since our chapter has had some experience
hosting the Ning site, I have volunteered to take this project on and have
put up a proof-of-concept site for the OWASP Foundation.  That said, a
community site is only worth something if the community gets involved and
contributes to it so I'd like it if you all took a moment to go to
http://myowasp.ning.com and created an account.  The super cool thing is
that I've linked it in with Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Yahoo so if you
already maintain an account in any of those places, you can use it here too.

The new site provides a ton of cool features.  Live chat, forums, blogs, RSS
feeds, event calendars, photo albums, video collections, and a ton more.  Be
sure to join the "Austin OWASP" group on there too so that you can
contribute to our own local community within the international one.  Getting
registered is really easy so I hope that all of you will get on and start
contributing today!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
President
Austin OWASP

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About Our Sponsor, Veracode</strong></span></p>
<p>Veracode provides the world?s leading Application Risk Management Platform. Veracode SecurityReview?s patented and proven cloud-based capabilities allow customers to govern and mitigate software security risk across a single application or an enterprise portfolio with unmatched simplicity. Veracode was founded with one simple mission in mind: to make it simple and cost-effective for organizations to accurately identify and manage application security risk. </p>
<p>Why has Veracode revolutionized the way in which software is being secured? Because our automated, SaaS service - SecurityReview - is a fundamentally better way to manage application security risk: </p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><strong>Automated</strong>. SecurityReview is completely automated and delivers a more consistent and efficient deployment of secure coding best practices and offers the fastest path to compliance over any competing application security testing solution. </li>
<li><strong>Security-as-a-Service (SaaS)</strong>. Our cloud-based model for application risk management scales globally across teams and geographies without need for any hardware or software leading to lower operational expenditures. Additionally, our service is more dynamic than any ?on-premise? tool as it gets smarter the more code it processes, resulting in higher quality results, reduced risk and significantly improved developer productivity. </li>
<li><strong>Multiple Analysis Techniques.</strong> A single subscription provides access to <a href="/solutions/application-security-analyze-your-app-statically.html"><font color="#0066cc">static (white box)</font></a> and <a href="/solutions/web-application-security-analyze-your-app-dynamically.html"><font color="#0066cc">dynamic (black box)</font></a> security testing capabilities and the knowledge of our world-class security experts which negates the need to deal with multiple security vendors. </li>
<li><strong>Flexible.</strong> Our service can be used to assess both internally developed applications or assess software risk in externally sourced components or applications. </li>
<li><strong>Trusted and Independent.</strong> Veracode provides a standards-based "Verified by Veracode" rating that helps organizations achieve the fastest path to compliance and demonstrate "visible proof" of security best practices. </li>
</ul>

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=Vqy6kEZg1OTpx_WGda6ybxGg2wQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dean let me know that his company is planning on doing an ad for
OWASP.org.  However he wants to make an ad that is useful to OWASP
members.

To figure out what OWASP people are looking for, he has asked the
Austin chapter to help do some quick A/B testing.  I just took the
survey and it was only 5 minutes.  See Dean's note below for details.

Note from Dean:
For the first twenty respondents, we will send a 20 Dollar Starbucks card
for your feedback on our OWASP banner ad[s].

The survey will close after the first twenty responses so you don't waste
your time --  Our deadline is 5pm today.

<p><strong>When:</strong> April 26, 2011, 11:30am - 1:00pm 
</p>
<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Rugged Dev: Building Reliability and Security Into Software</p>
<p>Complex systems fail over time and the larger they are, the more likely they 
are to fail in unforeseen ways. Come hear about the best practices we used and 
lessons learned when we built very large scale cloud-based products. Once 
exposed to the Internet, complex multi-tenant Web systems encounter a wide range 
of input from a variety of sources but still have to be long running and behave 
resiliently in the face of failures. We will examine 3 implementations of Rugged 
best practices to design and test your software for ruggedness. </p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> James Wickett (National Instruments)

Corey,

I'd recommend looking into the SANS Developer 543 course titled "Secure 
Coding in C & C++".  While I've never taken this course, I have done SANS 
in the past and they have excellent instructors and quality course 
materials.  Here's a link:

Hi Josh,

What I'm really looking for is a class to give me exposure to topics so I
can get a quick overview to build upon.  Basically I've taken SANS 610
(reversing malware) and 709 (exploit dev) and I want to take a C++ class to
write programs to debug and decompile for reversing and exploit dev.
purposes.  Thanks!

Hello,

Saw your post on the OWASP mailing list, so I thought I'd share my two cents.  Given your background and career aspirations, I would say the CISSP is way too much for what you're looking to do.  CISSP is all-encompassing, folks like to say it's a mile wide but only an inch deep.  So to do that cert you'll have to learn about fences, lighting, fire extinguishers, cryptography (DETAILS!  It's hard), business continuity and DR, etc.  In addition you'll need five years of professional experience to qualify as a CISSP.  You can pass the test and become an "Associate of ISC2" but that's not a CISSP.  Down the road as your career progresses I would say definitely go for the CISSP, in my opinion it's the gold standard of security.

If you're just trying to get a security cert that you can put on a resume, maybe CompTIA Security+ would be a better option. It's broader than just malware but much more manageable than the CISSP without the experience requirements.

If you are really interested in malware analysis, etc, then I'd look to SANS.  They have two courses which could be relevant:

 Reverse-Engineering Malware (Forensics 610)
http://www.sans.org/selfstudy/description.php?tid=4607


If you're really strong on the coding side, another option is Advanced Exploit Development (Security 710).

http://www.sans.org/selfstudy/description.php?tid=4777

The thing about SANS though, since you're a student, is that SANS is very expensive.  But like the CISSP, it to me is the gold standard.  I've never taken a SANS course but I have wanted to for the last 10 years at least.  Maybe there are student discounts?


One other avenue to consider is linux certification--the LPI is pretty good I think.  It's not security-specific, but linux is a good place to be right now career-wise.
http://www.lpi.org/eng/certification/the_lpic_program


Anyway, hope this helps.  If you have additional specific questions please let me know and I'll try to assist.  Good luck!

Thanks:)

I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the CEH yet.  While certainly not the 
most notable security certification (I think that goes to the CISSP), the 
Certified Ethical Hacker does a very good job at focusing on specific 
security vulnerabilities, exploits, and tools.  It's great information, 
but is nowhere near as broad as the CISSP which is a bonus considering 
your stated interest.  Plus, it's far cheaper than the other 
certifications mentioned at roughly $500 for the exam.

Sincerely,

I teach malware reverse-engineering classes at Black Hat, but as it would
probably be in poor taste for me to link directly to them, I'll just be
honest and say the following...

If you're looking to take malware analysis courses to educate yourself and
perform better at your job, then that's fantastic. But if you're looking to
get a certification just for improving your career opportunities, be
forewarned that most of the best security and/or AV companies could care
less about certifications. They'll judge you based on what you've published,
what tools you've written, and on your overall reputation in the industry.
