The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community
dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain
applications that can be trusted.  We advocate approaching application
security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most
effective approaches to application security includes improvements in all
of these areas.





Each month during our chapter meeting, a subject matter expert will present
and discuss one of the OWASP top 10 topics.  OWASP chapter meetings are
free and open to anyone interested in application security.
