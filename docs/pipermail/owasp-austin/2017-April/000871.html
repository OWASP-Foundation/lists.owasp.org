OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, April 25th from 11:30 AM

*The CISO Playbook*


The era of CISO-as-dictator is at an end. Growing cybersecurity with the

&#8220;yes&#8221; with the business. This session will cover solid tactics to lead
successful change throughout your organization.

the enterprise and their products. John is a former Air Force Special Agent
with over 20 years of experience in information security including but not
limited to criminal, counter-intelligence, fraud and computer crime
investigations. Prior to joining Alienvault, he served as the Director of
Information Security for National Oilwell Varco. His experience includes
management roles for Halliburton, Mandiant, Guidance Software, and Mantech
International. The US Intelligence community recognized him for his work in
steganography. As a consultant, he responded to some of the highly
publicized cyber-attacks, including: Moonlight Maze, Titian Rain, Night
Dragon, TJX and Operation Aurora. He holds a B.S. in Information Systems
Management from the University of Maryland University College, and M.S. in
Network Security from Capitol College in Maryland. Additionally, he is a
Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).
