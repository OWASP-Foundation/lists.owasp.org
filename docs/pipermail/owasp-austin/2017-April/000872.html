<PRE>Hello Everyone!


The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for May is going to be a week
earlier and on a different day than normal, *on Wednesday, May 3, 2017*.
It will still be at the usual location - Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill
at 183 and Burnet.  This different day and week is to coincide with BSides
Austin.


Our sponsor will be *Rapid7*.


&#8212;&#8212;


Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Rapid7


*When:*  *Wednesday, May 3rd*, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm *


** Note that for May it will be on a different day and one week earlier
than normal, to coincide with BSides Austin.*


*Where: *Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd).  We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.


*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the *OWASP Austin Chapter* and *Capital of Texas ISSA
Chapter* and sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second
Thursday of the month from January to September (but occasionally we make
schedule adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social
gathering of local information security professionals. If you're involved
with InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good
food and conversation.


*Sponsor:* Rapid7


*Rapid7 is engineering better security with simple, innovative solutions
for IT security's most critical challenges. Our security data and analytics
solutions collect, contextualize, correlate, and analyze the security data
you need to dramatically reduce threat exposure and detect compromise in
real-time. They speed investigations so you can halt threats and clean up
systems fast. Plus, our analytics give you the specific information you
need to systematically improve security processes within your organization.
Unlike traditional vulnerability assessment or incident
management, Rapid7's comprehensive data collection, attacker intelligence
and user-behavior analytics give you immediate insight into the security
state of your assets and users from the endpoint to the cloud. We offer
unmatched capabilities to spot intruders leveraging today's #1 attack
vector, compromised credentials. Our ability to help goes beyond our
innovative technology. Rapid7 security experts can help you advance your
security program, whether you need emergency breach response or to
transform your security processes and better align investments to your
organization's risk and needs. Rapid7 is trusted by more than 4,150
organizations across 90 countries, including 34% of the Fortune 1000. Our
products are top rated by Gartner&#174;, Forrester&#174; and SC Magazine. For more
