Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Vectra Networks
When: Thursday, June 11th, 5pm-7pm
Where: Sherlocks Baker Street Pub and Grill, 183 & Burnet (we meet in the
large room to the right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the
room.)

What: The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.
Sponsor:

Vectra Networks

Vectra Networks? is the leader in real-time detection of in-progress cyber
attacks. The company?s advanced threat-detection solution continuously
monitors internal network traffic to pinpoint cyber attacks as they happen.
It then automatically correlates threats against hosts that are under
attack and provides unique context about what attackers are doing so
organizations can quickly prevent or mitigate loss. Vectra prioritizes
attacks that pose the greatest business risk, enabling organizations to
make rapid decisions on where to focus time and resources. In 2015, Gartner
named Vectra a Cool Vendor in Security Intelligence for addressing the
challenges of post-breach threat detection. Visit us at

OWASP Austin June Chapter Meeting
When: Tuesday, June 30th @ 11:45 - 1PM
Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac. Building C

Title: Authz is the new Authn: Trust Elevation with UMA and OpenID Connect

Increased trust in an online identity = increased mitigation of the risk of
fraud. As an enterprise interacts with a person via the Internet, it may be
prudent, for certain transactions, to have more evidence of that person?s
identity. Web Access Management systems include some proprietary features
to force ?stepped-up authentication.? But luckily, new OAuth2 profiles like
UMA and OpenID Connect offer a standards based approach to achieve
inter-domain trust elevation. This session will include a high level
overview of the Enterprise UMA use case and some of the useful OpenID
Connect features that can be leveraged to create centralized authentication
policies.

Speaker: Mike Schwartz

Mike has been an entrepreneur and identity specialist for over 18 years. He
is the technical and business visionary behind Gluu, whose open source OX
projects enable domains to centralize authentication and authorization
using open standards like SAML and OAuth2. Mike is a domain expert in
application security, directory services, and strong authentication. He has
been a guest speaker at RSA Europe, Gartner Catalyst, EIC and other
identity conferences.

Food: (Sponsored by LASCON) It will be a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be
sure to have enough for all!

Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/give-aways that may
take place!

Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Or if you can not attend we should be broadcasting the meeting GoToMeeting

Subject: [Owasp-austin] PHP Coders Looking for Work?
Message-ID: <CAFwvDez+vHgNzpfyiAzd32i8SYuZALB5K3ErBX3tXDJXnJDZvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey OWASP Austin!

I'm curious if there is anyone on this list who considers themself to be
pretty good at PHP, knows enough about application security to write
decently secure code, and who is interested in some contract work?  I have
a really cool offer from a company to expand my open source SimpleRisk tool
to include audit functionality.  They are willing to fund the effort and
will let me release it open sourced as part of SimpleRisk.  In short, it's
a paid contract that you can feel good about because your efforts will go
back to helping our community and, by hiring someone else, it allows me to
keep my focus on the SimpleRisk core.  If you are interested, shoot me an
e-mail to let me know your level of expertise with PHP (1-10 scale), your
ability to commit (# of hrs per week), and your hourly rate.  Thanks!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
Creator of SimpleRisk
