Subject: [Owasp-austin] looking for examples of security breaches costing $
Message-ID: <20090611225342.GI7130@subspacefield.org>

Hello gang,

I have an online book about security, located here:

http://www.subspacefield.org/security/security_concepts.html

In Section 4, I'm looking for examples where security failures led to
the bankruptcy of a company or large fines.

So far I've got the TJ Maxx incident, and the Greek cellphone tapping
incident, but am looking for others.

I know we had a speaker who talked about PCI compliance and perhaps
someone involved with that kind of work would be aware of other examples.

Oh, and please pass the link to the book on to anyone you might know
who is interested.

I would look through the recent Verizon data breach investigations
report as well as the Web Hacking Incidents Database:

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Interview with Ross Anderson
Message-ID: <4A48D1E0.3030303@gmail.com>

I apologize for the shameless self promotion, but I wanted to let you
know that the interview I did with Ross Anderson at AppSec EU 2009 [1]
is not available as an OWASP Podcast here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Podcast_28
and on iTunes [2].  It covers some very interesting topics and expands
on some of the issues raised in his keynote on May 13th [3] titled "Web
App Security ? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".  Definitely worth
listening to the 32 minutes - in my humble opinion.  You may know Ross
Anderson for his very well regarded book Security Engineering [4] which
is now in its second edition.
