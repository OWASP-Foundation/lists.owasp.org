<PRE>This is going to be a great talk and something that you dont want to
miss.  See you on Tuesday.

When: November 17, 2009, 11:30am - 1:00pm

Topic: Tracking the progress of an SDL program: lessons from the gym

Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high intensity
weight training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate goal
is often clear, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently
make is to overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting
progress.

Like a successful bodybuilding workout, a security development
lifecycle program must consistently log simple to obtain, yet
meaningful metrics throughout the entire process. Good metrics must
lack subjectivity and clearly aid decision makers to determine areas
that need improvement. In this presentation we&#8217;ll discuss metrics used
to classify and appropriately compare security vulnerabilities found
in different phases of the SDL by different teams working in different
locations and in different products. We&#8217;ll also discuss how to easily
provide decision makers different views of the same data and verify
whether the process is indeed catching critical vulnerabilities
internally.

Who: Cassio Goldschmidt (Symantec)

Cassio Goldschmidt is senior manager of the product security team
under the Office of the CTO at Symantec Corporation. In this role he
