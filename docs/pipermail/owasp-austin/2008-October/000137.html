<PRE>I'm only hitting one point for now.  I'll try and send more info when I
get the chance as I've got the clock ticking on an up coming meeting.
Luckily I type fast...

&gt;<i> Management's desire is for user convenience, and they cite many sites
</I>&gt;<i> with stored payment information that use email address as login (Amazon,
</I>&gt;<i> Paypal, etc.).
</I>
I had a similar argument along those lines.  What you need to think
about is if Amazon &amp; Paypal's customer profiles match your customer
profiles.  In my case, it was totally opposite.

Here's my point:  For my case, we don't get $'s from the users in
question.  So for us, compromised accounts represent a cost without any
income to offset the loss.

The real question for you is if the increased income from making logins
easier will be greater than the costs from the loss of sensitive data.
Considering PCI requirements, increasing legal requirements for breach
notification, etc, you will really need to look at the revenue gained by
user convenience.  I have no idea of your revenue models, but estimating
the cost of a breach may give you some good numbers to work with.  Don't
forget to consider soft costs like loss of reputation, goodwill, etc.

I'm not saying email address is universally bad.  I'd love to have Jeff
Bezos's income.  Email address seems to be working for him.  What we
don't know is what mechanism(s) are in place at Amazon to mitigate that
risk.  They could basically be self-insuring by accepting a revenue loss
for account compromise, assuming their revenue is adequate.

HTH.  Off to meeting.
