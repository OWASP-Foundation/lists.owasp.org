<PRE>When: October 28, 2008, 11:30am - 1:00pm

Who: Josh Sokol

Josh Sokol graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in
Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several large
companies including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a military
contractor, and is currently employed as a Web Systems Administrator at
National Instruments. In his current role, Josh provides expertise in topics
such as web application availability, performance, and security. Josh is
also a frequent contributor on the Web Admin Blog.

Topic: Using Proxies to Secure Applications and More

The last Austin OWASP presentation of the year is a must see for anyone
responsible for the security of a web application. It is a demonstration of
the various types of proxy software and their uses. We've all heard about
WebScarab, BurpSuite, RatProxy, or Paros but how familiar are you with
actually using them to inspect for web security issues? Did you know that
you can use RatProxy for W3C compliance validation? By the time you leave
this presentation, you will be able to go back to your office and wow your
co-workers with the amazing new proxy skills that you've acquired.

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building C which is the tallest
building on campus (8 levels). There will be signs posted in the lobby to
direct you where to go and the receptionists will be able to assist you as
well. See directions to National
Instruments.&lt;<A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=11500+N+Mo-Pac+Expy,+Austin,+TX+78759&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=30.406377,-97.726135&amp;spn=0.017211,0.036778&amp;om=1">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=11500+N+Mo-Pac+Expy,+Austin,+TX+78759&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=30.406377,-97.726135&amp;spn=0.017211,0.036778&amp;om=1</A>&gt;
