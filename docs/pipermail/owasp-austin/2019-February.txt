Hello everyone!


This is a reminder that this month's OWASP Austin Chapter monthly meeting is
*next week,* *Tuesday*, February 26, 2019.


If you have not already done so, please register on Eventbrite
<https://owasp-austin-2019-february.eventbrite.com/> so that we can be sure
to order enough food for everyone.


*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for February*

*When: *Tuesday, February 26th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

*Where: *National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Title: *Angular for AppSec Professionals


*One of the most popular web frameworks is Angular. While you don't need to
become an expert in new JavaScript frameworks to be able to conduct
successful assessments of Angular applications, knowing the fundamentals
and building blocks of that framework can definitely give you an advantage
during the initial phases of an application security assessment. This talk
aims to introduce application security professionals to the basics of
AngularJS and Angular applications from a security standpoint. We will also
demonstrate how to dynamically debug Angular code from the browser console.
This allows us to change the behavior on an application by manipulating
Angular components. With that knowledge in hand, we can start conducting a
more in-depth analysis of Angular based applications.*


Speaker: Alex Useche


*Alex is an Application Security Consultant at nVisium and has over 12
years of experience in the IT industry as a software developer, security
engineer, and penetration tester. As a software developer, he has worked
with and architected mobile and web applications in a wide range of
languages and frameworks, including Angular, .NET and Django. While his
expertise is in application security, Alex also has experience conducting
penetration tests of internal and external networks. In his previous
position, Alex led several projects aimed at building secure coding and
DevOps processes for a mid-sized consultancy agency, as well as automating
security analysis tasks. Alex has a Bachelors in Information Technology and
a Masters in Software Engineering. He has also conducted and published
research on artificial intelligence technologies. Alex is actively working
on developing security tools written in Go and participating in various bug
bounties.*


*Food: *Tacodeli. *PLEASE RSVP ahead of time* so we can be sure to have
enough for all!

We apologize to anyone who was wanting to view today?s OWASP Austin Chapter meeting via GoToWebinar.  Just before the meeting we discovered that the OWASP Foundation had deactivated the account.  Unfortunately we were not able to get in contact with anyone at the Foundation to assist. We will be working with them to get access to the new tool (Zoom) so that we can have that working before next month?s meeting.
