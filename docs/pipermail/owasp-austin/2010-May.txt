  Topic: Javascript Hijacking                                               
                                                                            
                                                                            
  This attack is an offshoot of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and is    
  common when AJAX is involved. It was well publicized in 2007 when the     
  gmail contact list was found by Jeremiah Grossman to be vulnerable to it. 
  This presentation will include a technical explanation of the attack, a   
  demonstration, and a discussion.                                          
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Who: Ben Broussard (UT Austin)                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Ben Broussard is a developer for the University of Texas at Austin with   
  an academic background in mathematics, specifically cryptography. At UT   
  he has translated and prioritized web application attacks in relation to  
  the environment that the developers are working in. Ben is currently      
  leading a web application security focused team of developers from        
  different departments around campus.                                      
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Topic: Attacking Intranets from the Web Using DNS Rebinding               
                                                                            
                                                                            
  DNS Rebinding works by implementing code that circumvents the web         
  browser's same-origin policy and penetrates your private network. The     
  exploit was popularized by RSnake in 2009. This presentation will explore 
  how DNS Rebinding works, a walk-thru of a running demo, and what it means 
  to your organization.

  Topic: Javascript Hijacking                                               
                                                                            
                                                                            
  This attack is an offshoot of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and is    
  common when AJAX is involved. It was well publicized in 2007 when the     
  gmail contact list was found by Jeremiah Grossman to be vulnerable to it. 
  This presentation will include a technical explanation of the attack, a   
  demonstration, and a discussion.

  Ben Broussard is a developer for the University of Texas at Austin with   
  an academic background in mathematics, specifically cryptography. At UT   
  he has translated and prioritized web application attacks in relation to  
  the environment that the developers are working in. Ben is currently      
  leading a web application security focused team of developers from        
  different departments around campus.                                      
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Topic: Attacking Intranets from the Web Using DNS Rebinding               
                                                                            
                                                                            
  DNS Rebinding works by implementing code that circumvents the web         
  browser's same-origin policy and penetrates your private network. The     
  exploit was popularized by RSnake in 2009. This presentation will explore 
  how DNS Rebinding works, a walk-thru of a running demo, and what it means 
  to your organization.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] web security biz ideas
Message-ID: <20100528101855.GA714@subspacefield.org>

Hey, does anyone here have ideas for web security ideas that they
don't really have time to investigate or implement themselves, and so
would be willing to share freely with others who may suddenly find
themselves with talent, a lot of time on their hands, but negative
cash flow? ;-)

I'm looking at potential business opportunities, and given how bad web
security really is, it seems like an underserved market.  However, I'm
just starting to brainstorm and research what tools & services exist
and what have yet to be created.  I have several ideas, and some vague
possible directions, but was wondering what others thought.

One of my ideas I'm willing to share is to mine web server logs for
better analytics, worms, attack trends, anomaly detection, usability
analysis (or stickiness), and maybe even post-facto IDS.  There may be
a problem, though, in terms of sheer volume.

Cheers,
Travis

PS: Bear in mind:

     An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of
     would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is
     the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is
     execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms
     with a brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a
     nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That
     shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less
     than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.

I attended this in Berkeley/Oakland on Thursday.  For $190 (plus $10
parking), it was well worth it.

Papers online.

Looking forward to getting a copy of Jeremiah Grossman's keynote preso,
had some great stats on how important web security is.
