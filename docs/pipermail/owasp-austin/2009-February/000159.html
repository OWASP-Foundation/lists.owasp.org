<PRE>*When:* February 27, 2009, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Topic: * Web Application Security in the Airline Industry: Stealing the
Airlines' Online Data

In this session, attendees will learn about the types of airline data that
is at risk of being stolen by online data thieves. In addition, the
following topics will be further explored:

1. Important attack scenarios and Web-based vulnerabilities accompanied by
examples of how these attacks can be mitigated by deploying comprehensive
defense solutions;

2. Protection strategies and tools, such as Web application scanners and Web
application firewalls, which help equalize the gap between the advanced Web
hacker and the security professional; and

3. Compliance and Software development life cycle approaches.

Following the September 11 attacks, the airline industry recognized its need
to 'webify' online ticket reservation systems, crew scheduling, and
passenger profiles in order to enhance operational efficiency. This
ultimately served to decrease the airlines' operating costs, thereby
increasing their operating profits. However, the following questions remain:
At what costs? What are the information systems and customer data security
risks associated with the airline 'webification' process?

Please join in this presentation, which will outline some of the challenges
that members of the airlines industry may face when attempting to protect
their online services. Additionally, attendees will discover methodologies
that airlines may utilize to identify, assess, and protect against the
various risks associated with Web-based application attacks.
