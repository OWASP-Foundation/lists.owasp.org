Check out &quot;OWASP - Stealing Airlines' Data February 24th&quot; on Austin OWASP

James Wickett

Time: February 24, 2009 from 11:30am to 1pm
Location: National Instruments
Organized By: Rob MacDougall:

Event Description:
Quincy Jackson
Information Security Manager
CISSP / CEH

Topic: Web Application Security in the Airline Industry

Presentation Title: Stealing the Airlines&#8217; Online Data

Session Description:

In this session, attendees will learn about the types of airline data that is at risk of being stolen by online data thieves. In addition, the following topics will be further explored:

Important attack scenarios and Web-based vulnerabilities accompanied by examples of how these attacks can be mitigated by deploying comprehensive defense solutions;
Protection strategies and tools, such as Web application scanners and Web application firewalls, which help equalize the gap between the advanced Web hacker and the security professional; and
Compliance and Software development lifecycle approaches.

Following the September 11 attacks, the airline industry recognized its need to &#8216;webify&#8217; online ticket reservation systems, crew scheduling, and passenger profiles in order to enhance operational efficiency. This ultimately served to decrease the airlines&#8217; operating costs, thereby increasing their operating profits. However, the following questions remain: At what costs? What are the information systems and customer data security risks associated with the airline &#8216;webification&#8217; process?

Please join in this presentation, which will outline some of the challenges that members of the airlines industry may face when attempting to protect their online services. Additionally, attendees will discover methodologies that airlines may utilize to identify, assess, and protect against the various risks associated with Web-based application attacks.
