<PRE>Hi everyone!

Lots of things going on that I wanted to let y'all know about.

--------------------------------------------------------------

*LASCON X - CFP and CFT now open!*


We want this year's LASCON, our 10th year anniversary, to be extra special,
and with that we want to attract some great speakers and training.


The *Call for Papers (CFP) *is now open. Visit our website -
<A HREF="https://lascon.org/cfp/">https://lascon.org/cfp/</A> - to submit your talk.


The *Call for Training (CFT)* is also open.  Go to <A HREF="https://lascon.org/cft/">https://lascon.org/cft/</A>
to submit your training proposal.


We have set a *deadline of April 14, 2019* for both CFP and CFP, so submit
yours today!

--------------------------------------------------------------

*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting - March 26, 2019*


Just a reminder that our March chapter meeting will be the last Tuesday of
this month, March 26th. H&#233;ctor Quartino will be presenting on &quot;*Browser
Hardening, Personal Security and Privacy Measures*&quot;.  If you have not
already done so, please RSVP so we have enough food ordered:

--------------------------------------------------------------

*BSides Austin*


This year BSides Austin is celebrating its 10th anniversary. In addition to
the two days of conference sessions and networking, they are adding:

   - Two days of *low-cost* training classes prior to the conference to
   provide deeper learning opportunities: *The BSides Austin Training Days
   run March 26-27*
   - The Mental Health Hackers Village, a resource room dedicated to
   educating information security professionals about the unique mental health
   risks faced by those in the field and providing guidance on reducing the
   effects of related mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, social
   isolation, and other mental health disorders



Tickets to the two-day conference (March 28-29) are still available, but
they wouldn&#8217;t suggest holding off much longer to buy yours. They have sold
out for the past three years, and why take chances?

Register for $35 at <A HREF="https://bsidesaustin.com/.">https://bsidesaustin.com/.</A>



If you&#8217;re still on the fence, the program schedule is now live at
<A HREF="https://bsidesaustin.com/schedule/,">https://bsidesaustin.com/schedule/,</A> and they think you&#8217;re going to love
this year&#8217;s lineup.



BSides Austin Training Days is comprised of six small-classroom infosec
courses that give you that deep-dive experience at prices set to make you
consider taking those two extra days off work! Read more and register at

--------------------------------------------------------------

*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour - we need your help*


As you may have noticed, we have not been able to maintain a consistent
monthly happy hour. This is mainly due to our struggles with finding
sponsors. If you happen to have any contacts with a company who is willing
to sponsor the happy hour, then please let us know.  We have some companies
who are willing to sponsor for later months, but right now we need to find
one who can sponsor for next week (Thursday, March 14th). Your help will be
greatly appreciated.
