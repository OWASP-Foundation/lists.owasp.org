Subject: [Owasp-austin] good books on web application security
Message-ID: <20080521210456.GK5193@subspacefield.org>

So I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on security books
relevant to Web 2.0 companies.

BTW, if anyone is interested, I'm writing a book here:

I ended up getting the Web Application Hacker's Handbook; it looked pretty good to me.

BTW, here's a good list of the web vulns from 2007

PS: If any of you are technically inclined, the AHA meeting is next Wednesday...

owasp-austin at lists.owasp.org, you are invited to

Title: OWASP Austin - Web Services Security
Time: Tue May 27 11:30am ? 1pm (Timezone: Central Time)
Where: Whole Foods Downtown
Calendar: 
Description: When: May 27th, 2008, 11:30am - 1:00pm 
Who: Nathan Sportsman and Praveen Kalamegham, Web Services Security
Topic: Web Services Security
The concept of web services has become ubiquitous over the last few
years. Frameworks are now available across many platforms and languages
to greatly ease and expedite the development of web services, often
with a vast amount of existing code reuse. Software companies are
taking advantage of this by integrating this technology into their
products giving increased power and interoperability to their
customers. However, the power web services enables also introduces new
risks to an environment. As with web applications, development has
outpaced the understanding and mitigation of vulnerabilities that arise
from this emerging technology. This presentation will first aim to
identify the risks associated with web services. We will describe the
existing security standards and technologies which target web services
(i.e., WS-Security) including its history, pros and cons, and current
status. Finally we will attempt to extrapolate the future of this space
to determine what changes must be made going forward.
Where: Whole Foods, 550 Bowie Street, Austin, TX 78703.
Come to the Whole Foods plaza level and sign in with receptionist. To
get to the plaza take the stairs from the main entrance. The stairs are
located on the West Side of the building, just north of the main
entrance. There is no access to the Plaza level from inside the store.
See directions to Whole Foods.
Cost: Always Free
Questions or help with Directions... call: Scott Foster 512-637-9824.
