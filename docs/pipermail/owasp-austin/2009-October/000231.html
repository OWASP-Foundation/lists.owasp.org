<PRE>*When:* October 27, 2009, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Topic: *Vulnerability Management In An Application Security World

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code
reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk.
Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing
with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically
require the coordination of security teams with application development
teams and require security managers to secure time from developers during
already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes
require changes to custom application code and application-specific business
logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often
sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.

This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while
trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines
strategies security teams can use for communicating with development teams.
Similarities and differences between security teams&#8217; practice of
vulnerability management and development teams&#8217; practice of defect
management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication
between these groups.

*Who:* Dan Cornell (Denim Group)
