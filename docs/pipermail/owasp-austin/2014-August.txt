Subject: [Owasp-austin] Help OWASP at the UT Cyber Security Awareness Month
	Event!
Message-ID: <CAFwvDexv0_YowgrX0LJp=ML24-PMho3phrC5mKq8Y7r-so3BwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Austin OWASPers!

I know that it's been a while since you all have heard from me (at least
via the mailing list).  A very cool opportunity has come up that I wanted
to see if anyone was interested in helping me out with.  The University of
Texas Information Security Office is planning their first ever Cyber
Security Awareness month of activities which includes an awesome event at
the Student Activity Center Ballroom on Tuesday, October 21st (10 AM - 2
PM) for students, faculty, and staff interested in learning more about
cyber security.  The event will feature talks, vendors, a band, and food.
I have volunteered to lead the effort on arranging for an OWASP presence at
the event.  This will include a booth where we can get creative on
activities, prizes, etc and potential speaking slots as well.  While there
will be CS, EE, and other students and faculty that may want a deep dive on
security, they are trying to keep it broad enough so that the general
student population will get some actionable tips out of it as well.  What a
cool opportunity!  So...who wants to work with me to figure out how to get
these students interested in OWASP and AppSec?

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
OWASP Board of Directors, Treasurer

Hey Josh,

Just FYI, ISSA Austin got the same invite. Let's keep in touch about
plans! I reckon the more of us (folks and local organizations) show up,
the better... :-)

Cheers,

You were either successful in unsubscribing from the OWASP-Austin list or
your list membership is at a different address from your last post (
Richardf at nv2cb.com).  I cannot find this address either via the web
interface for the OWASP-Austin list or via the command-line Mailman tools:

$ find_member --owner Richardf at nv2cb.com
$

 which shows no memberships.  As opposed, my address shows multiple - a
truncated list is below.

$ find_member --owner matt.tesauro at owasp.org
matt.tesauro at owasp.org found in:
     owasp-community
     owasp-leaders
     owasp-leaders (as owner)
     global_membership_committee
     appsec_eu_2010
     owasp-sanantonio
     ...
$

If you receive future posts from the OWASP-Austin list, please forward the
full email (including email headers) to me so that I can try to determine
which address is actually subscribed to the mail list.

Cheers!

Message-ID: <CAK8PssaERTvTUhVXdHUDnDdhbkikHVxE+Tz=CDSWDz4ThjGFFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy Austin OWASPers!

Can you believe it is already August?  Where has the summer gone?  The
weather in Austin has been wildly mild this summer and it already feels
like fall, at least for a few days!  If it gets back to the usual heat,
come inside for an OWASP event!

------------------------
Next Week!

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour Sponsored by Trustwave, August
14th!

When: Thursday, August 14th, 5-7PM
Where: Sherlocks Street Pub and Grill 9012 Research Blvd

Sponsor: Trustwave

What: The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.  (No chapter or organization membership is needed to attend.)

RSVP: https://aus-sec-happy-hour-2014-08.eventbrite.com
-- No RSVP required, but it helps the chapter to estimate tabs!

--------------
OWASP Monthly Meeting on August 26th

When: 11:30AM to 1PM CST -- food socializing first, meeting starts around
11:45
Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac Building C

Title: Identifying Web Attacks via Data Analysis

Abstract: This presentation will look at detection of SQL injection using
Machine Learning as well as profiling web traffic to find misbehaving
hosts. The goal is to get beyond "Top N" types of analysis and begin using
multiple features to guide us towards interesting traffic. With these
techniques multiple log types can be used, everything from web server logs
to proxy logs.

Speaker: Mike Sconzo

About: Mike enjoys attempting to solve/solving interesting security
problems with data analysis. He's spent most of his career on the defensive
side, and is constantly looking for new ways to detect suspicious and
malicious behavior. His background is heavy in network analysis and most of
the explored techniques revolve around use cases involved with network
forensics.

Food: Its a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough for all!
Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

RSVP: https://owasp-austin-2014-august.eventbrite.com

Or if you can not attend we should be broadcasting the meeting GoToMeeting.

Categories
========
The talk time duration includes time for questions and answers (5-10

track that includes new research, tools, vulnerabilities, zero days or
exploits.

  - Desi Jugaad (30 mins - 1 hr) - is our signature new research category
talk and includes any local hacks. This category is dedicated to hackers
who find innovative tech/non-tech solutions for real-life challenges.

  - Current Research Category (30 mins - 1 hr) - comprises of known
security issues, case studies, twist to an existing research, tool,
vulnerability, exploit or research-in-progress. Although this track is
fairly technical, it covers known techniques, analysis and research already
published or presented even though there might be some additions to it.

  - Tool Category (30 mins - 1 hr) - Comprises of open source security
tools, exploits, frameworks etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their software to the world.

Email the paper to: cfp at nullcon.net
The subject should be: CFP Goa 2015 < Paper Title >

Email Body:
    1. Name
    2. Handle

conference(s) or magazine(s)?
    Yes, No. If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the
previous ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or are
due to be given elsewhere prior to nullcon will be considered as current
research category talks unless they consist of cutting edge and ground
breaking technology, which is at the judgment of the review committee.

    15. Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

    16. Paper Abstract
    Please provide detailed working or your research/work. The more details
you provide the better it is for the reviewers. Please keep the abstract to
the point. Please do not try to hide the technical details or say "I can't
disclose it till bla bla" as it does not help the reviewers in any way and
may give your paper a low score because of insufficient information
available in the abstract.

    17. Your high resolution photo (attached)

Note
====
  - Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected.
  - The Abstract should clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail
and merely mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the
research to its full extent.
  - Be as descriptive as possible in the abstract.
  - Attach your source code/exploit/full paper along with the submission
  - nullcon is an open knowledge/research sharing platform and hence
product/company marketing and pitches will be rejected. We request you not

If you're still looking for volunteers, you can count me (and 2-3 of my Sec Engineers) in.

A very cool opportunity has come up that I wanted to see if anyone was interested in helping me out with.  The University of Texas Information Security Office is planning their first ever Cyber Security Awareness month of activities which includes an awesome event at the Student Activity Center Ballroom on Tuesday, October 21st (10 AM - 2 PM) for students, faculty, and staff interested in learning more about cyber security.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP CryptoParty Speakers Wanted
Message-ID: <CAFwvDezsZPM4edXtAEPq=-4XTimSzEaT5jwbXvcMBuWp1Owa3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Austin OWASPers!

In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'
where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without
privelege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or
station of birth.  We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may
express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being
coerced into silence or conformity."  The Internet of today is an amazing
place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr.
Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars.  We must be free to
to communicate and associate without fear.  To realize our right to privacy
and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.
CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these
solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to
privacy and anonymity online.  Topics include technologies like TOR,
full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more.  CryptoParties are free to
attend, public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 27, 2015 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first ever
CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about
the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy.
When the time comes, we will encourage you all to invite your family,
friends, and peers to attend this event, but for now, I am looking for
others who are willing to give a 10 minute max presentation on a
crypto-oriented subject.  The presentation will need to be laid out so that
novice and experienced alike can take action based on the data presented.
All tools must be free and open source.  If you are interested in
presenting, please e-mail me directly (do not reply to the list) with your
name, bio, talk title, and abstract for consideration.  This is going to be
EPIC!

~josh
