Hi,

I found this event and I thought the OWASP community would be interested:
"Learn how today's cybercriminals target your computer, identity and
money and get practical advice on how to combat anything that comes
your way. Our security experts will explore how malware threats
actually work and what you can do to protect your company.

We'll show you:

A live demonstration of how a malware attack occurs, step-by-step
What the threat landscape looks like?how it's changing, trends to watch
The top 5 things you can do today to make your business more secure"

The presenter is from Sophos and it will be at SHI office. You can
register at: http://www.sophos.com/en-us/about-us/events/schedule.aspx

On a different topic, I would like to share experience in CJIS
implementations. Please contact me directly at
matthias.buchner at gemalto.com if you are interested.

Cheers,
Matthias

      April OWASP Chapter Meeting

*When:* April 24th, from 11:30a-1:00pm

*Topic:*: Anatomy of Advanced Email Attacks (Aaron Estes, Cigital)

Abstract: Email attacks comprise an overwhelming majority of the daily
attacks on modern enterprise. The leading mitigation strategy is a
combination of user awareness training and email filtering. This talk
outlines a proposed solution that brings email risk and awareness
information down to the client level in order to better equip end users
in making secure decisions when using email.

Anti-spam capabilities have been incorporated into email client
applications for some time now. These are usually in the form of junk
boxes or email filters that attempt to identify spam or other unwanted
email. Most anti-spam clients use bayesian filtering to determine
whether an email is spam or not spam, typically using word combinations
and statistical analysis to make a determination. Many experts also
advise wary email users to examine the raw email headers in order to
attempt to find evidence of an email attack. While this is not bad
advise, it is however a highly technical process and one cannot expect
the majority of email users to be able to carry out and act upon this
advice. This is the problem that the proposed Advanced Email Risk
Classification and Recipient Decision Assistance solution attempts to
solve. The operating name for this solution is Phish Finder.

*Speaker:* Aaron Estes, Cigital

Aaron Estes came to Cigital from Lockheed Martin where he spend 10 years
in the software engineering and security engineering fields. He began
his information security career as a system security engineer on the
F-35 program. Aaron has spent the last 5 years as a security engineer
and penetration tester for Lockheed Martin Enterprise Business Services
specializing in application penetration testing and user
awareness/social engineering testing. Aaron is also a professor at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas where he teaches senior and
graduate level security courses. He has nearly completed his Doctor of
Engineering in Software Engineering at Southern Methodist University,
has a Masters in Software Engineering from Southern Methodist University
and has a Bachelors in Computer Science from University of Texas. Aaron
is a Certified Information System Security Professional.

*Cost:* Free, of course, but please RVSV!

      Random Hacks of Kindness, June 1-3


From: Luveen Wadhwani <Luveen.Wadhwani at bazaarvoice.com>

Hey folks,

Random Hacks of Kindness Austin is coming up on June 1 - 3, and I'm
writing to request that you participate in and spread the word about
this awesome event!

For those of you that haven't heard of it, RHoK is a weekend hackathon
with a difference. First, it's a global event: twice a year, people at
over 30 RHoK venues across the world from Boston to Bangalore come
together to collaborate on projects. Second, RHoK hacks are for
humanity: the event aims to unleash technology's potential for solving
global problems like disaster management and natural resource
management. Over the space of a weekend, participants at past events
have created solutions used to direct relief efforts in the Chilean and
Haitian earthquakes; address critical water management issues; aid
effective interactions with people who have communication disorders; and
many, many more. RHoK hacks have a global scope, and global impact.

A RHoK event brings the best and brightest developers, designers, and
managers together with subject matter experts and local stakeholders who
are passionate about solving issues with technology. At RHoK, you can
connect with your peers in the Austin tech community, and stay well fed
and caffeinated while you hack up a storm. There is no fee to
participate! We only ask that you bring a laptop, and a passion to
change the world for the better.

This is a really big deal - non-profit organizations like your local
charity, fire department, or community emergency response team don't
typically have access to top-notch technical talent. Providing these
organizations with a platform to define their problems and solve them
using technology is key to increasing how effectively they function; and
ultimately, how successful they are in achieving their purpose to make
the world a better place for everyone.

This is where you come in. The RHoK team needs your help to make this
event a success! There are many ways in which you can help out:
   * Participate! We need developers, designers, and managers - the more
that come, the more problems we can solve.
   * Tell your friends, here at BV and outside! This event is powered by
people like YOU - if more people in Austin know about it, our hacks will
be that much more impactful.
   * Connect us with companies who can sponsor! Bazaarvoice is currently
the main sponsor of RHoK Austin, but our city has truckloads of tech
(and non-tech) companies that can support the event with in-kind
donations, food, a data set, an API or service, developer hours, venue
space, swag, and in a zillion other ways.
   * Connect us with subject matter experts and local stakeholders from
the community! We've had people like the Executive Director of
Breakthrough Austin, a dev manager from HomeAway, and data scientists
from NASA present problem definitions at RHoK Austin last December. If
you support an organization or cause that has a technology need, they
should be represented here.
   * Connect us with notable people who can speak at the event, or act
as judges for the hacks! This will help raise the visibility of the event.
   * Volunteer to help out at the event! We need assistance for
everything from finding a live band to doing grocery runs when supplies
run out. If you're a sucker for logistics, you've come to the right place!
For more information and details about the June event, please visit our
website (http://www.rhok.org/event/austin-tx-usa-0). To spread the word,
direct your friends and contacts to this blog post
(http://www.rhok.org/blog/austin-building-technology-humanity-and-youre-invited).


I look forward partnering with all of you - please get in touch with me
at any time to discuss any questions you may have. I can't wait to hear
back from you on how you can help RHoK Austin be the best RHoK ever!

Thanks and Regards,

*Topic:*: "Closing the window of opportunity"(Jim Manico and Siri De
Licori of WhiteHat Security)

*Abstract*:"Closing the window of opportunity" and will be discussing
the state of web application security based on recent statistics drawn
from WhiteHat's database of thousands of sites under service and the
characteristics of a program that can help organizations develop a
strong web security posture and reduce or eliminate the opportunities
attackers have to compromise their applications.

This will be a product agnostic presentation, of course, though we will
be using WhiteHat data (along with Jim's long experience) to present the
problems we see and how we can go about solving them.


*Speakers:*

*Jim Manico*

      Random Hacks of Kindness, June 1-3


From: Luveen Wadhwani <Luveen.Wadhwani at bazaarvoice.com>

Hey folks,

Random Hacks of Kindness Austin is coming up on June 1 - 3, and I'm
writing to request that you participate in and spread the word about
this awesome event!

For those of you that haven't heard of it, RHoK is a weekend hackathon
with a difference. First, it's a global event: twice a year, people at
over 30 RHoK venues across the world from Boston to Bangalore come
together to collaborate on projects. Second, RHoK hacks are for
humanity: the event aims to unleash technology's potential for solving
global problems like disaster management and natural resource
management. Over the space of a weekend, participants at past events
have created solutions used to direct relief efforts in the Chilean and
Haitian earthquakes; address critical water management issues; aid
effective interactions with people who have communication disorders; and
many, many more. RHoK hacks have a global scope, and global impact.

A RHoK event brings the best and brightest developers, designers, and
managers together with subject matter experts and local stakeholders who
are passionate about solving issues with technology. At RHoK, you can
connect with your peers in the Austin tech community, and stay well fed
and caffeinated while you hack up a storm. There is no fee to
participate! We only ask that you bring a laptop, and a passion to
change the world for the better.

This is a really big deal - non-profit organizations like your local
charity, fire department, or community emergency response team don't
typically have access to top-notch technical talent. Providing these
organizations with a platform to define their problems and solve them
using technology is key to increasing how effectively they function; and
ultimately, how successful they are in achieving their purpose to make
the world a better place for everyone.

This is where you come in. The RHoK team needs your help to make this
event a success! There are many ways in which you can help out:
   * Participate! We need developers, designers, and managers - the more
that come, the more problems we can solve.
   * Tell your friends, here at BV and outside! This event is powered by
people like YOU - if more people in Austin know about it, our hacks will
be that much more impactful.
   * Connect us with companies who can sponsor! Bazaarvoice is currently
the main sponsor of RHoK Austin, but our city has truckloads of tech
(and non-tech) companies that can support the event with in-kind
donations, food, a data set, an API or service, developer hours, venue
space, swag, and in a zillion other ways.
   * Connect us with subject matter experts and local stakeholders from
the community! We've had people like the Executive Director of
Breakthrough Austin, a dev manager from HomeAway, and data scientists
from NASA present problem definitions at RHoK Austin last December. If
you support an organization or cause that has a technology need, they
should be represented here.
   * Connect us with notable people who can speak at the event, or act
as judges for the hacks! This will help raise the visibility of the event.
   * Volunteer to help out at the event! We need assistance for
everything from finding a live band to doing grocery runs when supplies
run out. If you're a sucker for logistics, you've come to the right place!
For more information and details about the June event, please visit our
website (http://www.rhok.org/event/austin-tx-usa-0). To spread the word,
direct your friends and contacts to this blog post
(http://www.rhok.org/blog/austin-building-technology-humanity-and-youre-invited).


I look forward partnering with all of you - please get in touch with me
at any time to discuss any questions you may have. I can't wait to hear
back from you on how you can help RHoK Austin be the best RHoK ever!

Thanks and Regards,
Luveen Rupchand Wadhwani
Software Developer / RHoK Lead

Message-ID: <CAMMsCZszNpLft=EwNhSW+7Ey0BD=1n=Yt--Hdz3CCG+nkwuUTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm pretty new to the list, but I was wondering if there's enough South
Austin folks here to get some South side happy hours and meetings going?  I
live out towards Dripping Springs and work just south of downtown, so it's
really hard for me to be able to make most of the meetings and happy hours
that occur on the North side of town.

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?  Are there enough of us on
the South side to make this work?

Thanks!

Hi,

I'm pretty new to the list, but I was wondering if there's enough South Austin folks here to get some South side happy hours and meetings going?  I live out towards Dripping Springs and work just south of downtown, so it's really hard for me to be able to make most of the meetings and happy hours that occur on the North side of town.

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?  Are there enough of us on the South side to make this work?

Thanks!

Hi,

I'm pretty new to the list, but I was wondering if there's enough South Austin folks here to get some South side happy hours and meetings going?  I live out towards Dripping Springs and work just south of downtown, so it's really hard for me to be able to make most of the meetings and happy hours that occur on the North side of town.

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?  Are there enough of us on the South side to make this work?

Thanks!

Wow!  Great response!  So what are everyone's thoughts on where/when?  I
know we've had one suggestion for Bender Bar, but let's get some more ideas
before we decide.  Also, do we want to keep this to Thursdays as well?

How about a middle spot?  I only know a couple of places downtown (my son
works at one).  Any suggestions.

I was thinking something like the new Sherlock's that opened on S. Lamar in
the place of the Old Alligator Pub and Grill.  Figure that's pretty
centrally located on the South side and there is ample parking.  Not that
I'm a particular fan of Sherlock's, but plenty of parking and seating could
work well.  Just my $.02.

Hey Mike,

I actually know one of the managers at that Sherlocks so if we decide to go that route I can give him a shout, for planning ? agreed Sherlock?s does not have the most ?character? on the Southside but it?s central and accessible.

I was thinking something like the new Sherlock's that opened on S. Lamar in the place of the Old Alligator Pub and Grill.  Figure that's pretty centrally located on the South side and there is ample parking.  Not that I'm a particular fan of Sherlock's, but plenty of parking and seating could work well.  Just my $.02.

How about a middle spot?  I only know a couple of places downtown (my son
works at one).  Any suggestions.

I'm fine with the initial idea having been presented on the list, but we
need to be mindful of the amount of traffic that we are generating here.  I
think our OWASP Austin group on http://my.owasp.org would be the perfect
place to continue this discussion.  I've created a new discussion topic for
that here:

http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austin/forum/topics/south-austin-happy-hour

Anyone on this list who would like to respond back with interest or aide in
coordinating this event please participate there.  Thank you!

I was thinking something like the new Sherlock's that opened on S. Lamar in the place of the Old Alligator Pub and Grill.  Figure that's pretty centrally located on the South side and there is ample parking.  Not that I'm a particular fan of Sherlock's, but plenty of parking and seating could work well.  Just my $.02.

Hey Mike,

I actually know one of the managers at that Sherlocks so if we decide to go that route I can give him a shout, for planning ? agreed Sherlock?s does not have the most ?character? on the Southside but it?s central and accessible.

Hi,

I'm pretty new to the list, but I was wondering if there's enough South 
Austin folks here to get some South side happy hours and meetings going? 
 I live out towards Dripping Springs and work just south of downtown, so 
it's really hard for me to be able to make most of the meetings and happy 
hours that occur on the North side of town.

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?  Are there enough of us on 
the South side to make this work?

Thanks!
Mike Cherry

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Bounce notification e-mails
Message-ID: <CAFwvDeyoH0Dz3Xb31t88JOd313UTU6WREMgb0WL6WP0hMqBXHg@mail.gmail.com>

OWASPers,

It seems that some sort of an issue has cropped up on the OWASP Austin
mailing list that is causing strange "Bounce action notification" e-mails
to be sent out.  Unfortunately, these lists are set up by the OWASP
Foundation and we don't have a tremendous amount of control over them, but
I was able to disable the bounce action removals for the time being while
the issue gets looked into.  Our humblest apologies for any inconvenience.
