Howdy OWASPers!

We are rapidly coming to the end of this years OWASP chapter activities!
September was the last of the years Happy Hours and it will also be last
chapter meeting till January.  But we are going out with a bang again this
year with LASCON!  Don't forget to register for the greatest event put on
by our chapter -- go learn more about it and register at lascon.org

----------------------------------

OWASP Monthly Meeting on September 30th

Next Week!

When: 11:30AM to 1PM CST -- food socializing first, meeting starts around
11:45
Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac Building C

Title: Account Entrapment

Abstract: This talk covers two ways to force a victim into an attacker's
account (Account Entrapment): Login Cross-Site Request Forgery and
Cookie-based or Session Entrapment. This is a commonly overlooked
vulnerability despite high-profile exploits including Youtube.com. Because
it is often disregarded, this talk begins with an in-depth look at attack
scenarios and what an attacker can actually gain. It then describes how the
two attacks work and how to defend against them. Finally, though these
attacks are prevalent across the internet, it will show why state agencies
(with domains ending in .state.**.us) and large organizations with many
subdomains face special problems when building defenses against these
attacks.

Speaker: Ben Broussard

About: Ben Broussard has been involved in the Austin Appsec scene since
2008, helping to plan the first LASCON and running the OWASP study group
for a time. After doing subcontracting work for a number of security shops
and gaining a breadth of experience on both the threatscape and the
security organizations that attempt to address it, he took a position with
San Antonio based Denim Group (now with an Austin office). When not
researching appsec, Ben is a hobbyist in Human Physiology, Acrobatics,
Human Evolution, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and toddler wrangling. He also runs
Hot Lava Obstacle Course located on Burnet road.

Food: Its a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough for all!
Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection and Response
by Richard Bejtlich

Instruments, Building A, Room 217.
