Hello everyone!

Our next OWASP Austin chapter meeting will be July 25th.  Following are the
details:
------------------------------------------------------------

*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for July*

When: Tuesday, July 25th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Title: *Frontline Web App Security*


According to the Verizon DBIR (Data Breach Investigation Report) for 2016,
web application attacks are the #1 source of data breaches. Web
applications account for only 8 percent of overall reported incidents.
However, attacks on web applications accounted for over 40 percent of
incidents resulting in a data breach, and were the single-biggest source of
data loss.


With those threats in mind, it has never been more important to ensure that
companies have visibility into what is happening with their web apps.  The
most effective way to address application flaws and preemptively block
unknown attacks is to have a close relationship with your web application
firewall.



Static, signature based blocking is not enough to address never before seen
attacks.  In this talk, we will walk through scenarios that we have
observed, talk about coding practices that enable your web app to be
secured, and describe the steps that are taken to defend against critical
web applications attacks.


*Speakers: *Paul Scott and Jason Payne


Paul Scott is an OWASP Houston chapter leader and the Manager of Alert
Logic?s Web Application Security Team.


Jason Payne ran the Alert Logic Global Security Operations Center for
nearly a decade and is now engineering solutions to defend systems,
networks, and application on premises and in the cloud.

*Food: *Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have
enough for all!

Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!
