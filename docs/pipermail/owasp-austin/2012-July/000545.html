Burnet.

    July OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting - Lightning Talks!


Want to try out your presentation skills? Here's your chance!  OWASP
Austin presents &quot;Lightning Talks&quot; for the July chapter meeting. This
will be a back-to-back series of 5 minute, controlled presentations.
Lightning talks are an excellent way to hone your presentation skills by
testing your ability to present clear ideas with defined time and
presentation restrictions. It can also be a lot of fun!

 Here is the criteria:

  * Each talk must be 5 minutes in length
  * Each slide deck will contain exactly 20 slides
  * The slides will auto-advance every 15 seconds
  * Try not to be too vendor-oriented.

We're thinking of an OWASP Top 10 Theme if we can get each of the 10
represented, but submit anything you like! (Preferably InfoSec related.)
Send your submission to either James Wickett or David Hughes in *PDF*
format so that we can quickly decide on the ones to be presented.

*When:* July 30th, from 11:30a-1:00pm

*Who:* Why, YOU of course. :-D

*Topic:* Lightning Talks!

*Cost:* Free, of course, but please RVSV!

*Food:* Oh yeah, Taco Deli time! *Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have
enough for all and be eligible for our monthly book giveaway! (I will
make the RSVP link available soon). *

*Location:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Questions?* call: David Hughes (512) 589-4623

    Other Announcements...

*Study Group*

We will be starting up the study group again this month, but there is a
chance it will not be until the 18th. I'm working on topic ideas and
very heavily leaning toward the idea of letting the members in the group
leading the discussions. Do you have a favorite security tool? Want to
cover the basics of some scripting language? Let me know! We want
something as hands-on as possible and nothing &quot;vendor-ish&quot; in nature.


*HackFormers*

HackFormers is meeting this week, Friday, July 6th from 12:00p to 1:00p
at the Microsoft Technology Center. See <A HREF="http://www.hackformers.org/">http://www.hackformers.org/</A> for
registration and more details.


*
AppSecUSA *

AppSecUSA is only a few months away! Have you registered? Do so now,
because the cost only increases as you delay. Want to volunteer? We need
lots of help leading up to and on the day of the conference. Contact
Paul Griffiths about how you can get involved with this huge Austin
event!  (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">griff at albioncomputergroup.com</A>)  <A HREF="http://www.appsecusa.org">http://www.appsecusa.org</A>
