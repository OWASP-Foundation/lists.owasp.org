*OWASP Study Group -- How About Metasploit? *

(Please sign up at the my.owasp.org site and join the OWASP Austin Study
Group to participate in the discussion mentioned below:)

We had a small turnout today (5) , I'm guessing largely because of
Blackhat/DefCon/B-Sides. We did some brainstorming and discussed
different topics for potential study group sessions. Here are some of them:

Open Authentication (oauth)
Metasploit
FISMA Compliance
Security Blitz on OWASP
Mobile Security
TrueCrypt
Kiosk Security
OWASP Top Tep
Malware
PhP security (Cheet Sheets)
Scripting Languages
ZAP\Webscarab\Burpsuite
Geolocation use\exploits
InfoSec Professional Development (Certs\Resumes\etc)


Everyone in attendance really liked the idea of doing a series on the
Metasploit book. I'm personally all for doing that. We can use Backtrack
and Metasploitable virtual systems for the hands-on. It should not be
too difficult to give everyone a quick tutorial on using VirtualBox. We
just need volunteers to step forward to help. I'm willing to help where
I can as well. We can also interrupt the series when we feel we need to
for other topics. Seventeen chapters will take us probably into early
next year, not counting interruptions, holidays, and conferences.

If we decide on this, we also need to ensure that everyone has a copy of
the book, either in electronic or paper format. When you buy one
directly from No Starch Press, you get a free electronic copy as well. I
can inquire about group discounts if we decide we want to pursue this. 
<A HREF="http://nostarch.com/metasploit">http://nostarch.com/metasploit</A>    If you order, inquire about discounts
for the book. They gave me a 30 percent off discount just for asking.

What does everyone think about doing Metasploit? 

Thanks

David H.
