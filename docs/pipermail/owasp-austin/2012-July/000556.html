&gt;<i> All,

</I>&gt;<i> For study group today, I'd like to have a brainstorming session to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss the direction of the group. I had planned to do this last week
</I>&gt;<i> but instead decided that the time would be better served letting Josh
</I>&gt;<i> present on something he's working on for a conference. It fit perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> into what we think the study group should look like from now on. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd also like to talk a bit about technical challenges. How best to
</I>&gt;<i> create a good lab environment, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's some talking points we are going to discuss:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The study group should be participant-led. Remember, it's not a
</I>&gt;<i> class, it's a study group. We in the OWASP leadership want to be there
</I>&gt;<i> to help where we can, but we do not lead or proctor the class. We are
</I>&gt;<i> participants like you and lead, like you, when we are presenting or
</I>&gt;<i> piloting discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Topics. I'd like everyone to start thinking about topics you'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to bring to the table. Do we want to do another series? I've had a LOT
</I>&gt;<i> of requests it seems for Metasploit. Last week we brought up the book
</I>&gt;<i> Practical Malware Analysis. I think both topics would allow for lots of
</I>&gt;<i> hands-on experience.  But maybe we want to steer away from longer series
</I>&gt;<i> for a time.  But when we do a series, the group should lead. Each week a
</I>&gt;<i> different person should be serving as somewhat of a guide. (Not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily a teacher).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. We'd like everyone to be involved. I think we have a lot of smart
</I>&gt;<i> people who have something to contribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Got a problem? Bring it to the group. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I can express how we'd like the study group to work best by
</I>&gt;<i> painting a fictional &quot;picture&quot; as an example (The names have been
</I>&gt;<i> changed to protect my poor recollection of actual names. :-) )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ***********************************
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week One: Mike does a presentation on using a debugger in reverse
</I>&gt;<i> engineering. The topic stirs a lot of conversation and runs long so we
</I>&gt;<i> decide to extend it for another week. Doug's presentation on cross-site
</I>&gt;<i> scripting is moved to week three.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week Two: More debugging. A side discussion on using Metasploit to
</I>&gt;<i> generate shell code pops up for the remainder of the hour. We decide to
</I>&gt;<i> do a future lab session where we get hands-on experience creating shell
</I>&gt;<i> code with MSF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week Three: Doug, having had more time to prepare XSS has set up a
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerable server application to demonstrate XSS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week Four: We had a discussion planned regarding XSRF led by Phil. He
</I>&gt;<i> decided he needed more time, so instead we had a group discussion about
</I>&gt;<i> various topics such as good Security Podcasts, recent books, and future
</I>&gt;<i> plans to do a series on the book Practical Malware Analysis.  We also
</I>&gt;<i> discussed helping each prepare resumes for job searches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week Five: Phil does a presentation on XSRF. This was followed by a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of questions and good discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week Six: Linda presents on the topic: Writing Ruby modules for
</I>&gt;<i> Metasploit. Good discussion. We decided that maybe we also needed
</I>&gt;<i> something to help us with our scripting skills. A series perhaps? Some
</I>&gt;<i> good Ruby resources were shared.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week Seven: We decide to do a short &quot;basics of Ruby&quot; series to help
</I>&gt;<i> provide us some basic scripting skills. A friendly debate breaks out
</I>&gt;<i> regarding Ruby vs. Python vs. Perl. We decide on Ruby and the book
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Programming Ruby&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week Eight thru Twenty-One, we cover the Programming Ruby book. Each
</I>&gt;<i> person in class chooses a chapter in the book to lead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Week twenty-two: We decide to create a project based on our new Ruby
</I>&gt;<i> skills.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bring your thoughts and ideas!
</I>&gt;<i>
