Subject: [Owasp-austin] STUDY GROUP NOTICE: This week and beyond
Message-ID: <BY2PR0201MB15436EFCAE01912CF3490261D01D0@BY2PR0201MB1543.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi everyone,

If you are in the Austin Study group, please read this message NOW. If you are not in the study group and don't plan to come, then please feel free to hit delete right NOW. :)

Josh found out that the entrance to Building A (our usually study group location) is still being worked on. They are just about done but behind schedule.

So, he booked us in Building C for this week. Thank you Josh.

Same room as the last time we met. So, it is building C in room 1E13 which is in the HR area behind the security desk (no badge access needed) in the building we do the chapter meetings.

Here is the new schedule and location for meetings:

Questions, comments, concerns? Email me at matt.pardo at owasp.org<mailto:matt.pardo at owasp.org>

Thanks and sorry for the short notice!

Matt
