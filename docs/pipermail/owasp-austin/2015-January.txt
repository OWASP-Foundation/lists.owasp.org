OWASP Monthly Meeting -- next on January 27th!

CryptoParty!

In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'
where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter without
privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or
station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may
express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being
coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet of today is an amazing
place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr.
Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to
to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy
and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.
CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these
solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to
privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR,
full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend,
public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 27, 2015 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first ever
CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about
the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy. We
encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this
event. Presentations will be laid out so that novice and experienced alike
can take action based on the data presented. All tools presented will be
free and open source. Our CryptoParty will end with the first-ever OWASP
Austin Key Signing Party. Don't miss this meeting and be sure to invite
your friends!

Speaker: Several ! -- Lead by Josh Sokol

RSVP -- https://owasp-austin-2015-january.eventbrite.com

Do you have a unique project or skill that you want to share with the local
community?  Have you ever wanted to be a speaker at conference?  Did you
make it your new years goal to present at a conference?    Austin has
opportunities!  Coming up --

BSides Austin 2015 has their CFP open --
http://bsidestexas.blogspot.com/p/austin-2013.html  (please ignore the
'2013' in the URL)
or directly at --
http://sniperforensicstoolkit.squarespace.com/bsides-austin-cfp/

They are primarily looking for 'blue team' (or defender) presentations, but
they have another track for any and all infosec related presentations.
BSides is a great local conference put on by some of the best of our
community.  Check it out!

----
Other opportunities abound, just not all are publicized.   Occasionally
OWASP Austin is contacted by other local folks for speakers on application
security topics.  Besides the great list of local speakers we have from
chapter meetings and such, OWASP Austin is looking to compile an additional
list of local people that are comfortable and potentially available to
speak on application security topics.  Anyone interested in being
potentially available?  Please email me off-list at kyle.smith at owasp.org

Thank you,

encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this

Austin Key Signing Party. Don't miss this meeting and be sure to invite

Speaker: Several ! -- Lead by Josh Sokol

--
If you have a PGP key and would like to participate in our key
signing party after the presentations, we recommend that you bring your ID
for others to check.

Ideally, also bring pieces of paper (business cards??) to hand out
that list at least your key ID and fingerprint -- this speeds up the
process of recording this kind of information when validating a party-goers
ID.

For those new to PGP, we will provide an introduction at the CryptoParty.
If you can't wait until then and want to get started with generating your
own key to bring to the party, you can find the home of the free
implementation of OpenPGP (including How-To's, etc.) with links to source
code and operating system-specific installation packages here:

Message-ID: <CAFwvDeyf_90J+1nTjU1tveHHcVB8_Dxx9cRAEudMWTXa056=3Q@mail.gmail.com>

I literally just had the most interesting phone call that I've ever taken.
A man called telling me that they had detected errors coming from my
computer. I immediately stopped him, told him he was trying to scam me, and
told him that I do security for a living. He immediately said "You got me"
and then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with me about what he
does, who he is, and why he does it. His real name was Baroon and he is
from Uganda. He told me that he will take the user into their Event Viewer
and show them the errors there to make them think that there's a problem
with their system. Once they see that, he will offer to help them and have
them launch a session with them. They will offer to fix it for $300 (which
he said is far less than some of the scammers who charge $2k). He first
told me that it's the persons fault for being stupid, but then shared with
me that he knows it's wrong and he is interviewing and trying to change
jobs. I told him that I appreciated his honesty and I wished him well with
his search for a more reputable job. Crazy.

I got a similar call and I pretended to play along. I don't know where 
they called from but they claimed to be from Microsoft's server room, and 
that they detected an issue. Basically the steps they wanted me to follow 
would have been enough to give them remote access to my computer - think 
not necessarily remote desktop, but RPC and the like, that the user can't 
even notice most of the time. My guess is they either wanted to turn it 
into part of a zombie network, or install some software they could steal 
personal information with. After I told him I didn't do anything because I 

know it's a scam, they quickly disconnected. (I got a second call few 
weeks later, but then I was the one to disconnect)

That?s awesome. One of my clients happened to get a call from a scammer like that while I was onsite, so he told the scammer, ?Oh really? My IT support is right here. You want to talk to him?? The scammer just told him, ?fuck you!? and hung up.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Phone Call Today (Too good not to share)

I literally just had the most interesting phone call that I've ever taken. A man called telling me that they had detected errors coming from my computer. I immediately stopped him, told him he was trying to scam me, and told him that I do security for a living. He immediately said "You got me" and then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with me about what he does, who he is, and why he does it. His real name was Baroon and he is from Uganda. He told me that he will take the user into their Event Viewer and show them the errors there to make them think that there's a problem with their system. Once they see that, he will offer to help them and have them launch a session with them. They will offer to fix it for $300 (which he said is far less than some of the scammers who charge $2k). He first told me that it's the persons fault for being stupid, but then shared with me that he knows it's wrong and he is interviewing and trying to change jobs. I told him that I appreciated his honesty and I wished him well with his search for a more reputable job. Crazy.

This happened to me about a year ago as well. "Oh really? These errors just
started?" I said. He said he was going to help me and proceeded to instruct
me to click on the "Start" button. "Are you sure? I don't have a 'Start'
button." I said. "It should be at the bottom left corner of your screen,"
he said. "I use Linux." He hung up.

wow, I received a similar call about 7 months ago! It was funny because I knew it was a scam from the beginning. Should have kept them on the phone longer and prank them! Kudos to josh for busting them!
