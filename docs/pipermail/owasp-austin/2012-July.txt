    July OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting - Lightning Talks!


Want to try out your presentation skills? Here's your chance!  OWASP
Austin presents "Lightning Talks" for the July chapter meeting. This
will be a back-to-back series of 5 minute, controlled presentations.
Lightning talks are an excellent way to hone your presentation skills by
testing your ability to present clear ideas with defined time and
presentation restrictions. It can also be a lot of fun!

 Here is the criteria:

  * Each talk must be 5 minutes in length
  * Each slide deck will contain exactly 20 slides
  * The slides will auto-advance every 15 seconds
  * Try not to be too vendor-oriented.

We're thinking of an OWASP Top 10 Theme if we can get each of the 10
represented, but submit anything you like! (Preferably InfoSec related.)
Send your submission to either James Wickett or David Hughes in *PDF*
format so that we can quickly decide on the ones to be presented.

    Other Announcements...

*Study Group*

We will be starting up the study group again this month, but there is a
chance it will not be until the 18th. I'm working on topic ideas and
very heavily leaning toward the idea of letting the members in the group
leading the discussions. Do you have a favorite security tool? Want to
cover the basics of some scripting language? Let me know! We want
something as hands-on as possible and nothing "vendor-ish" in nature.


*HackFormers*

HackFormers is meeting this week, Friday, July 6th from 12:00p to 1:00p
at the Microsoft Technology Center. See http://www.hackformers.org/ for
registration and more details.


*
AppSecUSA *

AppSecUSA is only a few months away! Have you registered? Do so now,
because the cost only increases as you delay. Want to volunteer? We need
lots of help leading up to and on the day of the conference. Contact
Paul Griffiths about how you can get involved with this huge Austin
event!  (griff at albioncomputergroup.com)  http://www.appsecusa.org

    Wednesday Study Group Starts This Month

Ben Broussard will no longer be able to lead our study group due to some
other commitments and I'm swamped, so here's my idea:

We have a lot of smart people in our group and I have seen many of you
lead different sections of past studies. I would like for you to pick a
tool, technique, topic, etc that you want to present to the group.It
does not need to be a formal presentation, and the more hands-on, the
better. Some ideas:

1. Your favorite Pen Testing Tool

2. A tutorial on your favorite scripting language.

3. Setting up a vulnerable system to attack

etc.


The coverage of the material should take no more than 40-45 minutes to
allow for discussion.


I recommend that each of us bring laptops and have virtual machines with
WTE, Backtrack, etc. and  as we create our lessons, let's try to set
them up so that students in the study group can follow along with your
examples. If we all have this kind of environment and the class leader
designs exercises with this in mind, we will all come prepared to
participate.

To help support this, I'm going to lead the the group on the 18th, and
the topic will be "Setting up a Security Testing\Lab Environment" where
we will discuss how to set up our systems using Virtual Box, WTE,
Backtrack, etc.

We'll try this out for a couple of months and continue on as long as we
have steam. :-)

I'm working on ideas for hands-on structured topics for future sessions.
Setting up the lab portion is going to be the tricky part. For example,
if we cover the newer Metasploit book, we'd want to be able to work with
some actual targets.



Always ready to hear more ideas about this. Think about what you want to
present!

Good Morning,
I just wanted to introduce myself to the mailing-list. My name is Anthony 
Cargile and I am going to be a senior at UT Austin. I currently work as a summer 
intern at Overwatch Systems. Yesterday I went to the Austin SPIN meeting and saw 
Josh Sokol present on web application security from the ground up. I briefly 
talked to him about OWASP and it sounded like something I would be interested 
in, so here I am. Looking forward to my first meeting and getting involved with 
yall.

Sincerly,
Anthony Cargile

P.S. Shout out to Josh for the great presentation

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Study Group Kickoff Tomorrow
Message-ID: <50057CF8.8020009@owasp.org>

All,

We're going to be trying something a little different in the study group
for a few weeks. I'd like to see the study group become a bit more
self-sufficient. I think it needs some internal momentum to keep things
interesting. 

What I propose is that the members of the group become the weekly
presenters, kinda like home brew computer clubs, AHA, etc.  Do you have
a favorite tool, or new technique you'd like to present? I'd like to see
you present something about that.  Here are my thoughts:

1.  Keep the actual "presentation" to a minimum to allow for more
discussion\hands-on time. This means less work for you and a much more
rich experience for those who attend.
2. Keep it as vendor-neutral as possible.
3. Favor hands-on and discussion over purely theoretical topics. If you
want to talk about public key crypto, for example, at least have a demo
of some sort.
4. Think about the type of group we have, auditors, pen testers,
analysts, developers, etc. Gear your presentation to achieve maximum
possible interest.
 5. Keep it fun.
6. It does not "have" to be technical, but it needs to be related to
InfoSec (or something that InfoSec people can in some way relate.)
7. Don't attack NI's network or break anything in the classroom. NI has
been a gracious host and we don't want to have to meet under a tree at
Zilker Park. :-)

We can of course also do "series" presentations\study as well. I've
heard requests for Metasploit and BurpSuite, which would take several
weeks for either, especially msf.

Tomorrow I'd also like to discuss some ways we can facilitate demos and
hands-on learning in the class, using Virtual Box, Backtrack, WTE, etc.
If we can agree on some standard ways of doing things, all students can
come to the class better prepared to be involved. It ought to be a fun
brainstorming session.  Bring your ideas!

We're meeting as usual at NI, Building A, Room 234 across from the
cafeteria entrance (The one next door to the one we've been using) for
the next two weeks.  Will be back in 217 after that. 


See you then,

David H.

All,

I forgot to mention the time: 12pm - 1pm. 

Also, we've had our first volunteer and he would like to present as soon
as possible, so I'm going to let him present tomorrow. We'll have a
short "moving forward" convo, and then  Josh Sokol will be leading a
brainstorming session on "Symbiotic Security".

Be thinking about what you'd like to present in future sessions. I'd
like to walk out of there tomorrow with 4-5 weeks already planned. :-)

I'll be utilizing the "OWASP Study Group" group on my.owasp.org for most
of the discussions concerning topic ideas and such. If you're not
already a member, please sign up to participate.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Study Group Today
Message-ID: <5010011A.90006@owasp.org>

All,

For study group today, I'd like to have a brainstorming session to
discuss the direction of the group. I had planned to do this last week
but instead decided that the time would be better served letting Josh
present on something he's working on for a conference. It fit perfectly
into what we think the study group should look like from now on. 

I'd also like to talk a bit about technical challenges. How best to
create a good lab environment, etc.

Here's some talking points we are going to discuss:

1. The study group should be participant-led. Remember, it's not a
class, it's a study group. We in the OWASP leadership want to be there
to help where we can, but we do not lead or proctor the class. We are
participants like you and lead, like you, when we are presenting or
piloting discussions.

2. Topics. I'd like everyone to start thinking about topics you'd like
to bring to the table. Do we want to do another series? I've had a LOT
of requests it seems for Metasploit. Last week we brought up the book
Practical Malware Analysis. I think both topics would allow for lots of
hands-on experience.  But maybe we want to steer away from longer series
for a time.  But when we do a series, the group should lead. Each week a
different person should be serving as somewhat of a guide. (Not
necessarily a teacher).

3. We'd like everyone to be involved. I think we have a lot of smart
people who have something to contribute.

4. Got a problem? Bring it to the group. 

I think I can express how we'd like the study group to work best by
painting a fictional "picture" as an example (The names have been
changed to protect my poor recollection of actual names. :-) )

***********************************

Week One: Mike does a presentation on using a debugger in reverse
engineering. The topic stirs a lot of conversation and runs long so we
decide to extend it for another week. Doug's presentation on cross-site
scripting is moved to week three.

Week Two: More debugging. A side discussion on using Metasploit to
generate shell code pops up for the remainder of the hour. We decide to
do a future lab session where we get hands-on experience creating shell
code with MSF.

Week Three: Doug, having had more time to prepare XSS has set up a
vulnerable server application to demonstrate XSS.

Week Four: We had a discussion planned regarding XSRF led by Phil. He
decided he needed more time, so instead we had a group discussion about
various topics such as good Security Podcasts, recent books, and future
plans to do a series on the book Practical Malware Analysis.  We also
discussed helping each prepare resumes for job searches.

Week Five: Phil does a presentation on XSRF. This was followed by a lot
of questions and good discussion.

Week Six: Linda presents on the topic: Writing Ruby modules for
Metasploit. Good discussion. We decided that maybe we also needed
something to help us with our scripting skills. A series perhaps? Some
good Ruby resources were shared.

Week Seven: We decide to do a short "basics of Ruby" series to help
provide us some basic scripting skills. A friendly debate breaks out
regarding Ruby vs. Python vs. Perl. We decide on Ruby and the book
"Programming Ruby"

Week Eight thru Twenty-One, we cover the Programming Ruby book. Each
person in class chooses a chapter in the book to lead.

Week twenty-two: We decide to create a project based on our new Ruby
skills.

etc.


Bring your thoughts and ideas!

David H.

Sorry, for those new to the group:

We're meeting as usual at National Instruments, Building A, Room 234
across from the
cafeteria entrance (The one next door to the one we've been using) for
the next two weeks.  Will be back in 217 after that.

    July OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting - Lightning Talks!

Want to try out your presentation skills? Here's your chance! OWASP
Austin presents "Lightning Talks" for the July chapter meeting. This
will be a back-to-back series of 5 minute, controlled presentations.
Lightning talks are an excellent way to hone your presentation skills by
testing your ability to present clear ideas with defined time and
presentation restrictions. It can also be a lot of fun!

Here is the criteria:
   Each talk must be 5 minutes in length
   Each slide deck will contain exactly 20 slides
   The slides will auto-advance every 15 seconds
   No Vendor slides please!

Come present on InfoSec or AppSec related topics. Send your submission
to either James Wickett in PDF format.

*When:* July 31st, from 11:30a-1:00pm

*Who:* Why, YOU of course. :-D

*Topic:* AppSec Lightning Talks!

*Speakers*

 Be mean to your code! - James Wickett
 Karthik Gaekwad
 Quorum Cryptography- David Hughes 
 Ernest Mueller
 The Magic of Symbiotic Security: Creating an Ecosystem of Security Systems - Josh Sokol
 David Lister
 Phil Beyer
 #securityisms - The Real APT! - Brian Engle
 Michael Cote (TENTATIVE)
 Hacker Vaccine
 Jay Hook

*Food:* Oh yeah, Taco Deli time! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have
enough for all and be eligible for our monthly book giveaway!

*Location:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*OWASP Study Group -- How About Metasploit? *

(Please sign up at the my.owasp.org site and join the OWASP Austin Study
Group to participate in the discussion mentioned below:)

We had a small turnout today (5) , I'm guessing largely because of
Blackhat/DefCon/B-Sides. We did some brainstorming and discussed
different topics for potential study group sessions. Here are some of them:

Open Authentication (oauth)
Metasploit
FISMA Compliance
Security Blitz on OWASP
Mobile Security
TrueCrypt
Kiosk Security
OWASP Top Tep
Malware
PhP security (Cheet Sheets)
Scripting Languages
ZAP\Webscarab\Burpsuite
Geolocation use\exploits
InfoSec Professional Development (Certs\Resumes\etc)


Everyone in attendance really liked the idea of doing a series on the
Metasploit book. I'm personally all for doing that. We can use Backtrack
and Metasploitable virtual systems for the hands-on. It should not be
too difficult to give everyone a quick tutorial on using VirtualBox. We
just need volunteers to step forward to help. I'm willing to help where
I can as well. We can also interrupt the series when we feel we need to
for other topics. Seventeen chapters will take us probably into early
next year, not counting interruptions, holidays, and conferences.

If we decide on this, we also need to ensure that everyone has a copy of
the book, either in electronic or paper format. When you buy one
directly from No Starch Press, you get a free electronic copy as well. I
can inquire about group discounts if we decide we want to pursue this. 
http://nostarch.com/metasploit    If you order, inquire about discounts
for the book. They gave me a 30 percent off discount just for asking.

What does everyone think about doing Metasploit? 

Thanks

David H.

From david.hughes at owasp.org  Tue Jul 31 19:50:12 2012
From: david.hughes at owasp.org (David Hughes)
Date: Tue, 31 Jul 2012 14:50:12 -0500
Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Study Group Tomorrow
Message-ID: <501836F4.2020508@owasp.org>

All,

Just wanted everyone to know about the OWASP Austin Study Group held
tomorrow and every Wednesday at National Instruments.

I know I haven't heard from everyone, but the general consensus is that
working through the Metasploit book is favorable to most. I have not
heard any negative feedback regarding the idea.

Tomorrow bring you're copy of the book if you have it and let's discuss
two things:

1. How best to divide the book for best coverage. We don't want to fly
through this book too quickly. We may also feel free to take a break
from it occasionally for this or that topic, related or unrelated to
Metasploit.
2. How best to recommend participants set up their systems to follow
along. Maybe we recommend that they run Backtrack and Metasploitable in
virtual machines, for example. We might need to adjust some examples in
the book to better fit our environment and setup. Obviously, if you
create additional exercises\demos, all the better.

If you don't already have the book, you can order it, but I recommend
waiting. If you order directly from No Starch Press, you get both the
book and the PDF. I've asked them if they can generate some sort of
coupon code for the book for an additional discount. I want to make sure
everyone has a copy, while at the same time making sure that everything
we use is paid for. No Starch Press is a smaller publisher and they take
a gamble on the goodness of geeks and hackers in giving away the PDF
with every book purchased.

http://nostarch.com/metasploit

If you do decide to go ahead and order it anyway, ask them first about a
discount. Keep in mind that, while you can get it cheaper from Amazon,
you will not get the free PDF.

Also, please sign up for a my.owasp.org account so that we can
communicate within that context. I want to keep any general study group
discussion off the OWASP list and instead kept within an environment
(my.owasp.org) that is more conducive to discussion.

We're meeting as usual at NI, Building A in 217 from 12:00p - 1:00p

See you then! 

David H.
