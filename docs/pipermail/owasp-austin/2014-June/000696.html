<PRE>(I posted this to AHA as well.  Sorry AHA peeps for the crosspost.)
Hey guys,

I know a lot of you work from home and have spouses / significant others
who do the same.  Our kids aren't babies anymore, and my wife is looking
for something to do from home.  She homeschools the kids part of the day,
so flexible hours would kinda be a must.

She's technical, but not uber-geek like us.  So she doesn't code, program,
etc., but she can type faster than almost anyone I know, work around any
piece of software, learn new things, get around just fine on a computer,
etc.  She did some website development in the pre-CSS days, has an
excellent grasp on grammar, spelling, and all the important things.

Bottom line:  She is a really smart chick with a wicked sense of humor, and
I'm not just saying that because she's my wife.

She'd also make a good telephonic social engineer as well, in my opinion.
Heck, she SE'd me into marrying her, so there's that.  (just kidding).

She's been kinda down on herself because she doesn't have a college
degree.  I said that shouldn't matter, considering how smart she actually
is.

If you guys have any lines on any kind of work, she's all ears.  You can
contact me directly at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">josh at radixtx.com</A> with any information.

Thanks guys!
