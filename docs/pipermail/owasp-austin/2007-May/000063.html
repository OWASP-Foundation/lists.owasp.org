<PRE>Folks,

 

The May OWASP meeting is scheduled for 11:30 - 1:00pm, at the downtown
Whole Foods market on the 29th of May.  Our speaker this month is Robert
Hansen and he will present a talk titled, &quot;Bullet Proof UI - A
programmer's guide to the complete idiot&quot;.

 

Robert will be talking about ways to secure a web-app from aggressive
attackers and the unwashed masses alike.  Bio is below:

 

Robert &quot;RSnake&quot; Hansen (CISSP) is the Chief Executive Officer of
SecTheory. SecTheory is a web application and network security
consulting firm. Robert has been working with web application security
since the mid 90's, beginning his career in banner click fraud detection
at ValueClick. Robert has worked for Cable &amp; Wireless heading up managed
security services, and at eBay as Sr. Global Product Manager of Trust
and Safety, focusing on anti-phishing, anti-cross-site scripting, and
anti-virus strategies. Robert also sits on the technical advisory board
of ClickForensics and contributes to the security strategy of several
startup companies. Robert is best known for founding the web application
security lab at ha.ckers.org and co-authoring XSS Exploits and Defense.

 

Robert is a member of WASC, IACSP, and ISSA, and contributed to the
OWASP 2.0 guide.

 

We will meet on the &quot;Plaza&quot; level - ask the receptionist for directions
to our room.  This is a brown bag style meeting - I supply (coerce
someone) into supplying milk/cookies.  Bring your lunch and get
educated!

 

See ya there!  Cd...
