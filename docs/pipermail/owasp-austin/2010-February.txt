Advanced Persistent Threat - What Does it Mean for Applications Security? 
- Tuesday, February 23, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
For our February Austin OWASP meeting, we have Matt Pour, SE for Blue Coat 
Systems, and former Security Solutions Architect and X-Force Field 
Engineer for IBM ISS.  He will be talking to us about the Advanced 
Persisitent Threat and what it means for Application Security.  Targeted 
attacks, slow moving malware, foreign intelligence/government sponsored 
hackers, corporate/industrial espionage ? all fun and games?  Not really. 
These vectors are occurring today, and the threat vector has bled into the 
application space.  What do you have to contend with once it passes 
through the firewall.  The meeting will be on Tuesday, February 23 from 
11:30 AM to 1:00 PM at National Instruments, Building C, as usual.  As an 
extra-special treat, this meeting will have lunch sponsored by Expanding 
Security, an awesome local company that you can leverage for great CISSP 
training, informative Security Summits, and much more!

RSVP on the Austin OWASP Ning Site
I've had a few people call me and ask if this is still going on.
Absolutely!  Our presenter drove in from Houston this morning and is here
at NI already.  Our sponsor has ordered plenty of food and drinks.  If your
office is closing for some reason, feel free to come on over to NI and hang
out in the lobby.  I will be down there around 11 AM and we can get into
the room at that time.  Drive safely and we'll see you soon!

Even with all of the snow, we had a great attendance at today's OWASP 
meeting with a fantastic speaker.  Thanks to everyone who came out.  Matt 
will be sending me a PDF of his slides in the next few days and I will get 
those up on the OWASP website for anyone who would like a copy.  There 
were some fantastic charts in there.  Also, for anyone who is interested 
in attending the Austin Security Summit on DNSSec that Dean talked about 
today, the information and enrollment link is below.  I will be sending 
out an invite in a little bit for our March Austin Security Professionals 
Happy Hour as well.  Drive safely!

Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Live CD is now on Ubuntu!
Message-ID: <1267073915.5280.64.camel@dargo>

A quick update to let everyone know that the conversion to Ubuntu is
complete.  There is a beta release (in the sense that Gmail was a beta)
available for download now as an .iso plus VirtualBox & VMware images.

Get them now and enjoy the new Ubuntu goodness.  You can get yours here:
http://www.appseclive.org/content/downloads

The current release was created to be equivalent to the AppSec EU
release in terms of tools with the exception of WebGoat which was
delayed by a re-write of WebGoat Manager.  Yup, that's 27 .debs just
waiting for you to enjoy!

The OWASP Live CD is a sub-project of OWASP WTE aka OWASP Web Testing
Environment.  The name change is to account for the ever growing methods
we're creating to get great tools and documents into your hands.  OWASP
WTE currently includes the .iso and virtual installs mentioned above.
Additionally, look for bootable DVDs, USB installs, and for those that
run Ubuntu natively, we'll have a Debian repository too.

There's tons of cool tweaks and upgrades in this beta so look for
several blog posts to appear over the next couple of weeks on
AppSecLive.org going into details on the goodness that awaits you.

For those that just can't wait or are just the curious sort, we've got a
Google Code site here:
http://code.google.com/p/owasp-wte/

where you can checkout the cool new stuff like the bash script to launch
WebScarab:
http://code.google.com/p/owasp-wte/source/browse/conversion/webscarab/contents/usr/bin/webscarab

More on the WebScarab package in a blog post to come.

Cheers!

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Last Call Discount for OWASP Members on DNSSec
	Security Summit
Message-ID: <OFA391A723.C346336E-ON862576D5.0064F170-862576D5.006570F2@ni.com>

Expanding Security has seven seats left for tomorrow's DNSSec Security 
Summit.  They are offering a pretty significant "Last Call" discount to 
OWASP members.  The price was $59, but you can attend and have a great 
lunch at the UT Club for $20!  I went to Dean's last summit on Cloud 
Security and was really impressed by the content presented and even more 
impressed with the group discussion on the topic.  I will also be 
attending tomorrow's summit.  If any OWASPers are interested in attending 
with me, go to http://bit.ly/b2QjWR and enter "LastCall0314" as the 
discount coupon code.  I hope to see you there!
