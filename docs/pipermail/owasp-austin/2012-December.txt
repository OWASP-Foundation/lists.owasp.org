Austin OWASPers

AppSec USA featured over 70 speakers for 58 sessions over two days. 
There was no way you could have seen it all!

We will be watching the videos of the top sessions together on Monday,
Dec 17th.  This is a great time to hangout with the OWASP Austin crew
and see the replay of AppSec USA 2012.  We will be starting at 9am and
ending close to 5pm with short breaks between videos and a break for
lunch around 12:00p.

*Location:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac., Building C, Room 1S13

**** Video Lineup will be determined by Vimeo stats as of Dec 16th.  ***

*RSVP: http://appsec-replay.eventbrite.com/?ref=estw#
