Hi everyone,

If you are in the Austin Study group, please read this message NOW. If you are not in the study group and don't plan to come, then please feel free to hit delete right NOW. :)

Josh found out that the entrance to Building A (our usually study group location) will be closed until after August 9th. Thanks to Josh for being vigilant and catching this before we had a meeting!

So, we are going to move the meeting to Building C EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY and until August. We will be meeting in building C in room 1E13 which is in the HR area behind the security desk (no badge access needed) in the building we do the chapter meetings.

Here is the new schedule and location for meetings:

7/7 = in Mopac C 1E13
7/14 = in Mopac C 1E13
7/21 = cancelled due to the reverse engineering training
7/28 = cancelled due to no rooms available
8/4 = may be cancelled due to BlackHat/Defcon or we may have in C 1E13 depending on numbers (we will take a poll at the meeting)
8/11 = resume normal schedule and location in building A

Questions, comments, concerns? Email me at matt.pardo at owasp.org<mailto:matt.pardo at owasp.org>

Thanks and sorry for the short notice!

Matt

Tuesday, July 26, 2016.


*HOWEVER*, unfortunately the presenter we had lined up cannot make it.
 Fortunately, though, Josh Sokol has graciously agreed to step in and
provide a presentation.  The Eventbrite and GoToWebinar have been updated
with the new presentation information.  I am including it also in this
email.


*If you have not already done so, please **RSVP on Eventbrite*
<http://owasp-austin-2016-july.eventbrite.com/> so that the food order can
be placed to ensure enough food for everyone.  Also, only those who RSVP

------------------------------------------------------------


OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, July 26th from 11:30 AM to
1:00 PM


*If I Knew Then What I Know Now: Building an InfoSec Program from Scratch*


Congratulations! You?ve been working hard for years and your employer has
finally seen your potential. You?ve now been promoted to being the only
person responsible for starting and managing an Information Security
Program for a $1B+/yr company. With nobody there to help you and a
minuscule budget, where do you start? How do you determine where the issues
lie and prioritize how to fix them? At what point do you grow your team and
how do you justify it? This vendor-agnostic talk will cover what you need
to know in order to build an efficient, cost-effective, and relevant
security program for your company.


*Speaker: *Josh Sokol


Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a
BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several
large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a
military contractor, and is currently employed as the Information Security
Program Owner at National Instruments. In his current role, Sokol manages
all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability
management activities for NI. Sokol created the free and open source risk
management tool named SimpleRisk, has spoken on dozens of security topics
including the much-hyped ?HTTPSCan Byte Me? talk at Black Hat 2010, and
currently serves on the OWASP Global Board of Directors.
