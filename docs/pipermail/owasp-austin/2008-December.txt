Subject: [Owasp-austin] January OWASP Meeting - January 27th - Stop hackers
	at the design phase through Threat Modeling
Message-ID: <f25fbcdc0812291341r73e5ca79s4bfdc56e428ef849@mail.gmail.com>

*When:* January 27, 2009, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Topic: *Stop hackers at the design phase through Threat Modeling

Over the last few years, significant progress has been made in back end SDLC
security controls. Vendors have developed sophisticated analysis tools
focusing on code inspection and application testing and organizations are
incorporating both automated and manual assessment methods into the latter
half of their development process. However, adoption of architectural risk
analysis has not been as widespread. Although threat modeling is not a new
concept and approaches such as Microsoft's STRIDE are well known, companies
have not internalized and adopted design related security controls with the
same vigor.

Threat modeling in the web app space is becoming increasingly important. The
purpose of this presentation is to provide an understanding of what threat
modeling is, why it is important, teach you how to do it and champion its
benefits.

This meeting will be slightly different from most OWASP meetings, because we
will be breaking up into small groups and complete a Threat Modeling
mini-workshop.

The Threat Modeling mini-workshop includes: - Understand the function and
security objectives of the application - Breakdown the application by
component - Identify and threats by category - Incorporate opposing
countermeasures - Prioritize vulnerabilities by risk and effort

This class will also cover the OWASP documentation (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling) and it is suggested
reading before the class.
