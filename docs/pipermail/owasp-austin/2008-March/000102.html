<PRE>*Topic: *Static Analysis Techniques for Testing Application Security

Static Analysis of software refers to examining source code and other
software artifacts without executing them. This presentation looks at how
these techniques can be used to identify security defects in applications.
Approaches examined will range from simple keyword search methods used to
identify calls to banned functions through more sophisticated data flow
analysis used to identify more complicated issues such as injection flaws.
In addition, a demonstration will be given of two freely-available static
analysis tools: FindBugs for the Java platform and FXCop for the .NET
platform. Finally, some approaches will be presented on how organizations
can start using static analysis tools as part of their development and
quality assurance processes.

*When:* March 25th, 2008, 11:30am - 1:00pm
