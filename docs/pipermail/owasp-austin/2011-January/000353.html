<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

We had our first OWASP event of 2011 last Thursday at Sherlocks.  If you 
weren't at the Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, then you missed 
out.  Maybe it was my charm and charisma or maybe it was the iPad we gave 
away courtesy of Rapid7, but in either case we had a record turnout of 
almost 40 people.  Were you there?  I hope so.  But if you weren't there, 
I'd like to know why.  Bad day or time?  You have a fear of groups of 
people in large public spaces?  I want everyone to be able to attend these 
awesome events so please let me know any thoughts that you may have on why 
you haven't gone. 

Our first meeting of the year is on Tuesday, January 25th (TOMORROW) at 
11:30 AM in our usual room (1S13) at National Instruments.  I was really 
bummed when Dan Cornell had to cancel his LASCON talk on Smart Phones with 
Dumb Apps.  After seeing the presentation at HouSecCon, it made me think 
that I would really like you all to have the opportunity to see it as well 
so I invited him to present at our January meeting.  In this presentation, 
Dan walks through the various ways an attacker can retrieve information 
from both the Android and iPhone platforms.  It's awesome.  You should 
plan on being there.

LASCON 2011 is scheduled for Friday, October 28th and this year promises 
to be even bigger and better than last year, but if you have ideas on 
things that we can improve upon, we're all ears.  Even better, if you want 
to volunteer some of your time to help plan and run LASCON, let us know. 
It's worth a free pass to the conference and a really cool T-shirt. 
Speaking of T-Shirts, this year we are having a design contest for both 
the conference shirts and the LASCON logo.  The selected logo and T-shirt 
designers will each receive a complimentary full conference pass to LASCON 
2011 at the Norris Conference Center on October 28, 2011.  They will also 
each receive a $50 gift certificate good for a purchase at the conference 
OWASP store.  Send your submissions to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">josh.sokol at owasp.org.</A>  Submissions 
for the conference logo are due by March 1, 2011 and submissions for the 
T-shirt design are due by June 1, 2011.  We want to see your skillz!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
