<PRE>*When:* May 27th, 2008, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Who:* Nathan Sportsman and Praveen Kalamegham, Web Services Security

*Topic: *Web Services Security The concept of web services has become
ubiquitous over the last few years. Frameworks are now available across many
platforms and languages to greatly ease and expedite the development of web
services, often with a vast amount of existing code reuse. Software
companies are taking advantage of this by integrating this technology into
their products giving increased power and interoperability to their
customers. However, the power web services enables also introduces new risks
to an environment. As with web applications, development has outpaced the
understanding and mitigation of vulnerabilities that arise from this
emerging technology. This presentation will first aim to identify the risks
associated with web services. We will describe the existing security
standards and technologies which target web services (i.e., WS-Security)
including its history, pros and cons, and current status. Finally we will
attempt to extrapolate the future of this space to determine what changes
must be made going forward.

*Where:* Whole Foods, 550 Bowie Street, Austin, TX 78703. Come to the Whole
Foods plaza level and sign in with receptionist. To get to the plaza take
the stairs from the main entrance. The stairs are located on the West Side
of the building, just north of the main entrance. There is no access to the
Plaza level from inside the store.
