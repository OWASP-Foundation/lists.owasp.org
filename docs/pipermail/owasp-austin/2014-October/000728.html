<PRE>Howdy Austin OWASPers!

We can't believe that the year is already almost over!  Once again, LASCON
was a huge success last week.  The LASCON volunteer crew had a blast
meeting so many new faces from all over.  The training session's were great
and the conference was outstanding.  We are already planning for another
amazing LASCON in 2015, but first we are going to take a little break from
OWASP activities, but we will be back in full force in January!  Stay tuned!

--
Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour -- next on January 8th!

--
OWASP Monthly Meeting -- next on January 27th!

--
Even the OWASP Study Group has been taking a break after finishing the last
book.  Check out the MyOWASP Ning site for their next scheduled meeting --
<A HREF="http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup">http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup</A>

--
While OWASP may be taking a break, other local Austin organizations are
blazing ahead during the fall/winter period like --

Austin ISSA - Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (CHFI) Training
December 1-5 @ Norris Conference Center in Austin

Come learn the essential hands-on skills needed to take your security game
to the next level. Whether you&#8217;re part of an incident response team or
investigating a computer crime, you need to figure out what they did, what
they changed and what they deleted so you can determine the best path. You
will learn how hackers and malicious users hide data, delete data and
attempt to hide their tracks. You will learn how to uncover what they have
deleted and how to follow the trail they left behind. You will also learn
how to be a first responder at a computer crime scene, how to handle
evidence, duplicate disks, investigate wireless attacks, investigate web
attacks, do mobile forensics and a myriad of other key skills.

Austin ISSA invites you to take the CHFI training the week of December 1-5
at the Norris Conference Center. This course normally costs $3000, but we
are offering it to members for only $1150! The course includes a voucher
for the CHFI certification (worth $500) and access to online labs so you
can practice the hands-on skills you learned. Class enrollment is limited,
so sign up &lt;<A HREF="http://austin-chfi.eventbrite.com/">http://austin-chfi.eventbrite.com/</A>&gt; early because it&#8217;s expected
to sell out.

Even more local activities (not just ISSA or OWASP) can be found at the
ISSA Capital of Texas Chapters' Calendar
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.austinissa.org/calendar/">http://www.austinissa.org/calendar/</A>&gt;
