Subject: [Owasp-austin] Any Incident Responders out there?
Message-ID: <CAFwvDew0RK_59rLvK3YA_+qu5KCdDPAi7TeEJHFVqeUr+=yU+A@mail.gmail.com>

A friend reached out to me saying that the company that his wife works for
believes they have had a credit card breach.  He was asking if I knew
anybody who could assist with something like that to find out what
happened, how much was compromised, and help them get back on track.  I
threw out some large company names like Mandiant and Trustwave, but I think
they'd prefer more like a local contractor type individual.  Anyone here
have the knowledge and bandwidth to help them out?
