OWASP Austin June Chapter Meeting

When: Tuesday, June 30th @ 11:45 - 1PM
Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac. Building C

Title: Authz is the new Authn: Trust Elevation with UMA and OpenID Connect

Increased trust in an online identity = increased mitigation of the risk of
fraud. As an enterprise interacts with a person via the Internet, it may be
prudent, for certain transactions, to have more evidence of that person&#8217;s
identity. Web Access Management systems include some proprietary features
to force &#8220;stepped-up authentication.&#8221; But luckily, new OAuth2 profiles like
UMA and OpenID Connect offer a standards based approach to achieve
inter-domain trust elevation. This session will include a high level
overview of the Enterprise UMA use case and some of the useful OpenID
Connect features that can be leveraged to create centralized authentication
policies.

Speaker: Mike Schwartz

Mike has been an entrepreneur and identity specialist for over 18 years. He
is the technical and business visionary behind Gluu, whose open source OX
projects enable domains to centralize authentication and authorization
using open standards like SAML and OAuth2. Mike is a domain expert in
application security, directory services, and strong authentication. He has
been a guest speaker at RSA Europe, Gartner Catalyst, EIC and other
identity conferences.

Food: (Sponsored by LASCON) It will be a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be
sure to have enough for all!

Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/give-aways that may
take place!

Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Or if you can not attend we should be broadcasting the meeting GoToMeeting
