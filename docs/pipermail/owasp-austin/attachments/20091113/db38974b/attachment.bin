DESCRIPTION:When: November 17\, 2009\, 11:30am - 1:00pm\n\nTopic: Tracking 
 the progress of an SDL program: lessons from the gym\n\nForcing muscle grow
 th is a long process which requires high intensity weight training and high
  mental concentration. While the ultimate goal is often clear\, one of the 
 greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently make is to overlook the importa
 nce of tracking their weight lifting progress.\n\nLike a successful bodybui
 lding workout\, a security development lifecycle program must consistently 
 log simple to obtain\, yet meaningful metrics throughout the entire process
 . Good metrics must lack subjectivity and clearly aid decision makers to de
 termine areas that need improvement. In this presentation we’ll discuss met
 rics used to classify and appropriately compare security vulnerabilities fo
 und in different phases of the SDL by different teams working in different 
 locations and in different products. We’ll also discuss how to easily provi
 de decision makers different views of the same data and verify whether the 
 process is indeed catching critical vulnerabilities internally.\n\nWho: Cas
 sio Goldschmidt (Symantec)\n\nCassio Goldschmidt is senior manager of the p
 roduct security team under the Office of the CTO at Symantec Corporation. I
 n this role he leads efforts across the company to ensure the secure develo
 pment of software products. His responsibilities include managing Symantec’
 s internal secure software development process\, training\, threat modeling
  and penetration testing. Cassio’s background includes over 12 years of tec
 hnical and managerial experience in the software industry. During the six y
 ears he has been with Symantec\, he has helped to architect\, design and de
 velop several top selling product releases\, conducted numerous security cl
 asses\, and coordinated various penetration tests.\n\nCassio represents Sym
 antec on the SAFECode technical committee and (ISC)2 in the development of
