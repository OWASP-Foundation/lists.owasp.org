DESCRIPTION:It was noted by our very astute Josh Sokol that I booked the wr
 ong time for the meeting later in the month.&nbsp\; And I did it wrong on t
 he wiki as well\, so at least I am consistent...&nbsp\; The OWASP Live CD r
 elease party is still at the same time as listed.<br><br>The correct time a
 nd date is <br><br>February 24\, 2009\, 11:30am - 1:00pm<br><br><br><br><b>
 When:</b> February 24\, 2009\, 11:30am - 1:00pm \n<p><b>Topic: </b> Web App
 lication Security in the Airline Industry: Stealing the Airlines? Online Da
 ta\n</p><p>In this session\, attendees will learn about the types of airlin
 e\ndata that is at risk of being stolen by online data thieves. In\nadditio
 n\, the following topics will be further explored:\n</p><p>1. Important att
 ack scenarios and Web-based vulnerabilities\naccompanied by examples of how
  these attacks can be mitigated by\ndeploying comprehensive defense solutio
 ns\;\n</p><p>2. Protection strategies and tools\, such as Web application\n
 scanners and Web application firewalls\, which help equalize the gap\nbetwe
 en the advanced Web hacker and the security professional\; and\n</p><p>3. C
 ompliance and Software development life cycle approaches.\n</p><p>Following
  the September 11 attacks\, the airline industry\nrecognized its need to ?w
 ebify? online ticket reservation systems\, crew\nscheduling\, and passenger
  profiles in order to enhance operational\nefficiency. This ultimately serv
 ed to decrease the airlines? operating\ncosts\, thereby increasing their op
 erating profits. However\, the\nfollowing questions remain: At what costs? 
 What are the information\nsystems and customer data security risks associat
 ed with the airline\n?webification? process?\n</p><p>Please join in this pr
 esentation\, which will outline some of\nthe challenges that members of the
  airlines industry may face when\nattempting to protect their online servic
 es. Additionally\, attendees\nwill discover methodologies that airlines may
  utilize to identify\,\nassess\, and protect against the various risks asso
 ciated with Web-based\napplication attacks.\n</p><p><b>Who:</b> Quincy Jack
