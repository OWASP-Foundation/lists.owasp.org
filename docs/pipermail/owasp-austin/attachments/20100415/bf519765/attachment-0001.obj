 : Automated vs. Manual Security
 : You can't filter The Stupid \nEveryone wants to stretch their securi
 ty budget\, and automated application security tools are an appealing 
 choice for doing so. However\, manual security testing isnâ€™t going a
 nywhere until the HAL application scanner comes online. This presentat
 ion will use often humorous\, real-world examples to illustrate the re
 lative strengths and weaknesses of automated solutions and manual tech
 niques. \n\nAutomated tools have some strengths\, namely low increment
 al cost\, detecting simple vulnerabilities\, and performing highly rep
 etitive tasks. However\, automated solutions are far from perfect. The
 re are entire classes of vulnerabilities that are theoretically imposs
 ible for automated software to detect. Examples include complex inform
 ation leakage\, race conditions\, logic flaws\, design flaws\, and mul
 tistage process attacks. Beyond that\, there are many vulnerabilities 
 that are too complicated or obscure to practically detect with an auto
 mated tool. \nWho
 : Charles Henderson (Trustwave) \nCharles Henderson has been in the se
 curity industry for over 15 years and manages the Application Security
  Practice at Trustwave. He has specialized in application security tes
 ting and application security assessment throughout his career but has
  also worked in physical security testing and network security testing
 . \nWhere
