 s partners\, and addressing global standardization issues. Also includ
 ed
 : awareness/education/training\, application security user groups\, se
 curity consulting staff development\, risk assessments\, security revi
 ews\, threat modeling\, source code scans\, deployment scans\, penetra
 tion testing\, exception management\, and executive escalations. Tell
