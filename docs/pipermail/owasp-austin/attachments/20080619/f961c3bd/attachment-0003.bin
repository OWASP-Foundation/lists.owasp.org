 n</p><p><br>\n<b>Topic: </b> Securely Handling Sensitive Configuration Data
 .\n</p><p>One of the age old problems with web applications was keeping sen
 sitive\ndata available on a need to know basis.  The classic case of this i
 s\ndatabase credentials.  The application needs them to connect to the\ndat
 abase but developers shouldn't have direct access to the DB -\nparticularly
  the production DB.  The presentation will discuss how we\ntook on this spe
 cific problem\, our determination that this was a\nspecific case of a more 
 general problem and how we solved that general\nproblem.  In our solution\,
  sensitive data is only available to the\napplication and trusted 3rd parti
 es (e.g. DBAs).  We will then cover our\nimplementation of that solution in
  a .Net 2.0 environment and discuss\nsome options for J2EE environments.  S
 o far\, we used our .Net solution\nsuccessfully for database credentials an
 d private encryption keys used\nin XML-DSig.  Sensitive data is only availa
 ble to the application and\ntrusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs).\n</p><p><b>Whe
