 Who:</b> Nathan Sportsman and Praveen Kalamegham\, Web Services Security\n<
 /p><p><b>Topic: </b>Web Services Security\nThe concept of web services has 
 become ubiquitous over the last few\nyears. Frameworks are now available ac
 ross many platforms and languages\nto greatly ease and expedite the develop
 ment of web services\, often\nwith a vast amount of existing code reuse. So
 ftware companies are\ntaking advantage of this by integrating this technolo
 gy into their\nproducts giving increased power and interoperability to thei
 r\ncustomers. However\, the power web services enables also introduces new\
 nrisks to an environment. As with web applications\, development has\noutpa
 ced the understanding and mitigation of vulnerabilities that arise\nfrom th
 is emerging technology. This presentation will first aim to\nidentify the r
 isks associated with web services. We will describe the\nexisting security 
 standards and technologies which target web services\n(i.e.\, WS-Security) 
 including its history\, pros and cons\, and current\nstatus. Finally we wil
 l attempt to extrapolate the future of this space\nto determine what change
 s must be made going forward.\n</p><p><b>Where:</b> Whole Foods\, 550 Bowie
