 hen: January 26\, 2010\, 11:30am - 1:00pm \nTopic
 : Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization \nThe first Au
 stin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting topic that m
 any of you have probably never thought about
 : Tokenization. The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your d
 ata instead of passing around the data itself. For example\, why would
  you give a customer account representative a full credit card number 
 when all they need to do their job is the last four digits? Using toke
 nization\, we are able to reduce the data security risk by limiting th
 e number of systems that actually store the data. This extremely simpl
 ifies audits for regulations like SOX\, HIPAA\, and PCI DSS. This pres
 entation will cover the business drivers for data protection\, what to
 kenization is\, and how to implement it. If your organization has data
  to protect\, then you're going to want to check out this presentation
 . \nWho
