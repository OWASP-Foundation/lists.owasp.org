DESCRIPTION:<p><b>When:</b> January 27\, 2009\, 11:30am - 1:00pm<br>\n</p><
 p><b>Topic: </b>Stop hackers at the design phase through Threat Modeling\n<
 /p><p>Over the last few years\, significant progress has been made in\nback
  end SDLC security controls. Vendors have developed sophisticated\nanalysis
  tools focusing on code inspection and application testing and\norganizatio
 ns are incorporating both automated and manual assessment\nmethods into the
  latter half of their development process. However\,\nadoption of architect
 ural risk analysis has not been as widespread.\nAlthough threat modeling is
  not a new concept and approaches such as\nMicrosoft's STRIDE are well know
 n\, companies have not internalized and\nadopted design related security co
 ntrols with the same vigor. </p><p>Threat modeling in the web app space is 
 becoming increasingly\nimportant. The purpose of this presentation is to pr
 ovide an\nunderstanding of what threat modeling is\, why it is important\, 
 teach\nyou how to do it and champion its benefits.\n</p><p>This meeting wil
 l be slightly different from most OWASP\nmeetings\, because we will be brea
 king up into small groups and complete\na Threat Modeling mini-workshop. </
 p><p>The Threat Modeling mini-workshop includes:\n- Understand the function
  and security objectives of the application\n- Breakdown the application by
  component\n- Identify and threats by category\n- Incorporate opposing coun
 termeasures\n- Prioritize vulnerabilities by risk and effort\n</p><p>This c
 lass will also cover the OWASP documentation (<a href="http://www.owasp.org
 /index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling" class="external free" title="http://www.ow
 asp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling" rel="nofollow">http://www.owasp.org
 /index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling</a>) and it is suggested reading before the
  class.  \n</p><p><br>\n<b>Who:</b> Nathan Sportsman\n</p><p>Nathan Sportsm
