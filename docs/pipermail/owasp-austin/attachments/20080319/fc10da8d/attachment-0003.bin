DESCRIPTION:<p><b>Topic: </b>Static Analysis Techniques for Testing Applica
 tion Security\n</p>\n<p>Static Analysis of software refers to examining sou
 rce code and\nother software artifacts without executing them. This present
 ation\nlooks at how these techniques can be used to identify security defec
 ts\nin applications. Approaches examined will range from simple keyword\nse
 arch methods used to identify calls to banned functions through more\nsophi
 sticated data flow analysis used to identify more complicated\nissues such 
 as injection flaws. In addition\, a demonstration will be\ngiven of two fre
 ely-available static analysis tools: FindBugs for the\nJava platform and FX
 Cop for the .NET platform. Finally\, some approaches\nwill be presented on 
 how organizations can start using static analysis\ntools as part of their d
 evelopment and quality assurance processes.\n</p><b></b><p><b>When:</b> Mar
