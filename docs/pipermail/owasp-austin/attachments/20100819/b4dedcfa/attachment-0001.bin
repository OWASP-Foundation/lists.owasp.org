 hen: August 31\, 2010\, 11:30am - 1:00pm \nTopic
 : Application Assessments Reloaded\n\nTrying to integrate Business Sof
 tware Assurance into Enterprise Risk Management and Information Securi
 ty Management programs has had issues over the years. Penetration-test
 ing was announced dead over a year ago\, but it's still the number one
  choice of application security professionals when starting out. Can t
 he activities from penetration-testing be re-used and turned into some
 thing innovative? \nTools (especially application scanners and secure 
 static analysis tools) have error rates so high\, they are useless in 
 the hands of newcomers (even for peripheral security testing). Some or
 ganizations have built entire applications around or on top of existin
 g appsec tools. Others are looking to use other kinds of tools\, such 
 as process/methodology/workflow tools\, to enhance their classic penet
 ration-testing tools. \nEven the testing/inspection methodologies them
 selves are outdated and we're finding that they are challenging or rep
 etitive in many environments. How do current appsec tools and testing/
 inspection methods work in the cloud? If we re-run the same kinds of t
 ests during dev-test\, software quality\, and application security cyc
 les\, aren't we wasting valuable time and effort? \nThis presentation 
 will provide discussion around how to solve many of these and other ch
 allenges in application security. The focus will be on web application
 s that use common technologies (HTTP\, SQL\, Classic XML/HTML\, Javasc
 ript\, Flash) but also updated to today's standards (RESTful transacti
 ons\, NoSQL\, HTML5\, Ajax/Json\, Flex2). \nWho
 : Andre Gironda\n\nAndre got his start on Unix-TCP/IP hacking before t
 he September that never ended. Bored of embedded platform research by 
 the time the dot-Bomb happened\, he joined the largest online auction 
 company\, worked as an appsec consultant for many years\, and recently
  joined a large online gaming company. He is known for his quirky mail
 ing-list posts and blog comments -- and at one time wrote for tssci-se
 curity.com. \nWhere
 : National Instruments\, 11500 N Mopac\, Building C which is the talle
 st building on campus (8 levels). There will be signs posted in the lo
 bby to direct you where to go and the receptionists will be able to as
 sist you as well. See directions to National Instruments. \nCost
