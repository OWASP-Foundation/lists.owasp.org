<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers!

I know that it's been a while since you all have heard from me (at least
via the mailing list).  A very cool opportunity has come up that I wanted
to see if anyone was interested in helping me out with.  The University of
Texas Information Security Office is planning their first ever Cyber
Security Awareness month of activities which includes an awesome event at
the Student Activity Center Ballroom on Tuesday, October 21st (10 AM - 2
PM) for students, faculty, and staff interested in learning more about
cyber security.  The event will feature talks, vendors, a band, and food.
I have volunteered to lead the effort on arranging for an OWASP presence at
the event.  This will include a booth where we can get creative on
activities, prizes, etc and potential speaking slots as well.  While there
will be CS, EE, and other students and faculty that may want a deep dive on
security, they are trying to keep it broad enough so that the general
student population will get some actionable tips out of it as well.  What a
cool opportunity!  So...who wants to work with me to figure out how to get
these students interested in OWASP and AppSec?

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
OWASP Board of Directors, Treasurer
