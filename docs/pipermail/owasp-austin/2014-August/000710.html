<PRE>Howdy Austin OWASPers!

Can you believe it is already August?  Where has the summer gone?  The
weather in Austin has been wildly mild this summer and it already feels
like fall, at least for a few days!  If it gets back to the usual heat,
come inside for an OWASP event!

------------------------
Next Week!

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour Sponsored by Trustwave, August
14th!

When: Thursday, August 14th, 5-7PM
Where: Sherlocks Street Pub and Grill 9012 Research Blvd

Sponsor: Trustwave

What: The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.  (No chapter or organization membership is needed to attend.)

RSVP: <A HREF="https://aus-sec-happy-hour-2014-08.eventbrite.com">https://aus-sec-happy-hour-2014-08.eventbrite.com</A>
-- No RSVP required, but it helps the chapter to estimate tabs!

--------------
OWASP Monthly Meeting on August 26th

When: 11:30AM to 1PM CST -- food socializing first, meeting starts around
11:45
Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac Building C

Title: Identifying Web Attacks via Data Analysis

Abstract: This presentation will look at detection of SQL injection using
Machine Learning as well as profiling web traffic to find misbehaving
hosts. The goal is to get beyond &quot;Top N&quot; types of analysis and begin using
multiple features to guide us towards interesting traffic. With these
techniques multiple log types can be used, everything from web server logs
to proxy logs.

Speaker: Mike Sconzo

About: Mike enjoys attempting to solve/solving interesting security
problems with data analysis. He's spent most of his career on the defensive
side, and is constantly looking for new ways to detect suspicious and
malicious behavior. His background is heavy in network analysis and most of
the explored techniques revolve around use cases involved with network
forensics.

Food: Its a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough for all!
Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

RSVP: <A HREF="https://owasp-austin-2014-august.eventbrite.com">https://owasp-austin-2014-august.eventbrite.com</A>
