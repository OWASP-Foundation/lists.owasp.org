Just a reminder about OWASP tomorrow.  Also, we started a ning group if
anyone wants to participate.  We will still use the official OWASP wiki and
email list, however this might be a good way to get to know other
OWASPers...


Join at http://austinowasp.ning.com/

Also we have a facebook group that we will also use.

Best,
James
