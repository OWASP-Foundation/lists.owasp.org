<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

I am pleased to announce that this year we will be adding on two different 
training classes the day before the Lonestar Application Security 
Conference (LASCON) on Thursday, October 27, 2011.  These training classes 
are unlike those you see at most conferences both in content and cost.  If 
you have not yet registered for LASCON, you will see both these trainings 
available for selection under the &quot;Agenda&quot; section of the conference 
registration for only $250.  If you have already registered for LASCON, 
simply go to <A HREF="http://www.regonline.com/lascon2011">http://www.regonline.com/lascon2011</A> and select the &quot;Already 
Registered?&quot; link.  Log in with the e-mail address you registered with and 
then select to edit your &quot;Agenda&quot;.  Place a check mark in the box for the 
training you would like to attend (or the FREE happy hour) and select 
&quot;Continue&quot; to check out.  The trainings are as follows:

TRAINING 1 ($250):
Title: Advanced Threat Tactics with Armitage and Metasploit

Metasploit is a powerful exploit framework and a must-have tool for 
penetration testers. Armitage builds a workflow on top of the Metasploit 
framework and exposes its most advanced capabilities. This demonstration 
and lab oriented session will teach you Metasploit and Armitage for the 
purpose of emulating adversary tactics. This course will start with the 
basics and quickly take you into the workflow of modern threats. You'll 
learn how to create trojan files, manage covert HTTP and HTTPS 
communications, set  up social engineering attacks, and use pivoting to 
take over a network.

To participate in the labs, you must have VMWare Player, VMWare Fusion, or 
VMWare Workstation installed.

Biography:
Raphael Mudge is a Washington, DC, based code hacker working on a new 
startup effort. He is the developer of the open source Armitage for 
Metasploit. Raphael  regularly writes and speaks on security topics. His 
work has appeared in USENIX ;login:, Linux Journal, and Hakin9. 
Previously, Raphael worked as a security researcher,  software engineer, 
penetration tester, and system administrator.

TRAINING 2 ($250):
Title: Bootstrapping Your Application Security Program 


This training class is for new managers &amp; leads accountable for 
integrating Application Security into their enterprise.  The course will 
walk through various success factors, including a mixture of strategy, 
policy, and technology considerations.  The course will help attendees 
develop incremental plans they can employ to make both short-term and 
long-term measurable improvements to their enterprise Application 
Security.
