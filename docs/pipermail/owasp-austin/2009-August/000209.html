<PRE>Mano Paul, a fellow OWASPer here in Austin asked me to forward this on to
the group.  He would be more than happy to answer any questions you might
have about the training and the pricing discount.  Feel free to spread this
around to friends and coworkers.

Friend, Austinites, Texans and everyone else



If you are in IT or software development, you are sure to have come across
the aspect of security as it pertains to software development and the
chances are that you have heard of the latest Certified Secure Software
Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) certification from (ISC)2.

This is to inform you that the very first public CSSLP certification class
will be held next week in Austin (8/17-8/21).

Working with (ISC)2  I have been instrumental in developing this
certification and was the 2nd person in the world to achieve this which has
benefitted me substantially in the software security arena. I believe
strongly that holders of this certification will have a similar benefit as
well.

I will be the instructor for this class and since this is the official
launch of the educational seminars from (ISC)2, one-time promotional and
aggressive discounts on this 5 day class is available that you can take
advantage of now.



If you are interested in the certification, please contact me for details of
about the certification, discounts available and for registration.

If you are already certified or if you know someone who might be interested
in the certification, may I kindly request you to forward this information
to them (or their security heads within their organization).



Additionally if you are interested in private corporate classes for your
organizations, you can contact me as well.



Kindly spread the word around and do not hesitate to contact me if you have
any additional questions.
