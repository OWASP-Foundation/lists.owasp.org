Thanks all! Frankly, I feel I took the helm of an already successful

simply done my best to try to maintain the course and speed. We have an
amazing group of people in the Austin chapter and I'm blessed to have
been a part of it. I feel both honored and humbled. Thanks for the
nomination!

I'd also like to recognize and thank Taco Deli for our success! ;-)

    Early LASCON Training Event!

*
**Title: *Hands on Web and REST Testing: Assessing Apps the OWASP way

*Trainer*: Matt Tesauro
*Dates: *Sept 16th and 17th, 9:00am to 5:00pm
*Cost:* $195/person
*Location:* Norris Conference Center, Austin, TX
*Abstract:*
The goal of the training session is to teach students how to identify,
test, and exploit web application and REST vulnerabilities. The creator
and project lead of the OWASP WTE (formerly the OWASP Live CD), will be
the instructor for this course and WTE will be a major component of the
class. Through lecture, demonstrations, and hands on labs, the session
will cover the critical areas of web application security testing using
the OWASP Testing Guide v3 as the framework and a custom version of
OWASP WTE as the platform. Students will be introduced to a number of
open source web security testing tools and provided with hands on labs
to sharpen their skills and reinforce what they've learned. Students
will also receive a complementary USB drive containing the custom WTE
training lab, a copy of the OWASP Testing Guide, handouts and
cheat-sheets to use while testing plus several additional OWASP
references. Demonstrations and labs will cover both common and esoteric
web vulnerabilities and includes topics such as Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS), SQL injection, CSRF and REST API testing. Students are encouraged
to continue to use and share the custom WTE lab after the class to
further hone their testing skills.
