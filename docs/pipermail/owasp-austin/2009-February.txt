Title: OWASP - Web Application Security in the Airline Industry: Stealing  
the
Airlines? Online Data
Time: Fri Feb 27 11:30am ? 1pm (Timezone: Central Time)
Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building C, Austin, TX
Calendar: owasp-austin at lists.owasp.org
Owner/Creator: wickett at gmail.com

Description: When: February 27, 2009, 11:30am - 1:00pm
Topic:  Web Application Security in the Airline Industry: Stealing the  
Airlines? Online Data
In this session, attendees will learn about the types of airline
data that is at risk of being stolen by online data thieves. In
addition, the following topics will be further explored:
1. Important attack scenarios and Web-based vulnerabilities
accompanied by examples of how these attacks can be mitigated by
deploying comprehensive defense solutions;
2. Protection strategies and tools, such as Web application
scanners and Web application firewalls, which help equalize the gap
between the advanced Web hacker and the security professional; and
3. Compliance and Software development life cycle approaches.
Following the September 11 attacks, the airline industry
recognized its need to ?webify? online ticket reservation systems, crew
scheduling, and passenger profiles in order to enhance operational
efficiency. This ultimately served to decrease the airlines? operating
costs, thereby increasing their operating profits. However, the
following questions remain: At what costs? What are the information
systems and customer data security risks associated with the airline
?webification? process?
Please join in this presentation, which will outline some of
the challenges that members of the airlines industry may face when
attempting to protect their online services. Additionally, attendees
will discover methodologies that airlines may utilize to identify,
assess, and protect against the various risks associated with Web-based
application attacks.
