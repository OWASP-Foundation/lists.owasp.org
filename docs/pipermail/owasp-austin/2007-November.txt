I thought I'd use this list for a little discussion to get people's juices
flowing!

So, question.  I have a Web site that needs to integrate its custom login
procedures with various ASPs - in other words, we have a Web site login.
As we "outsource" parts of our Web site, we want users to be able to log in
and go to site sections really hosted on ASPs and be "logged in".

What's the "industry standard" secure ways of doing this?  I have
programmers talking about all kinds of crazy solutions; spoofing setting of
cookies, puting junk in URLs, etc.  I'm not sure what the canonical
solution is...

   Assume that the site and the ASP have different but fairly-standard
   login schemes (set a cookie, etc.)
   Assume that it could be the first time the ASP's heard of the user; the
   site doesn't pump all its user data to each partner proactively (meaning
   some data transfer needs to take place at the time).

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Ernest

Hi Ernest,

Just a few thoughts to get the conversation started:

You might look into this article on SAML 2.0
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML) for some ideas.

You might also want to consider different ways to handle the various
affiliated sites, depending on the level of security your users require, and
taking into account the level of trust you place in those affiliated sites. 

For example, you're going to be a lot more careful if the transactions might
involve payment data, but handing off just for the sake of some
personalization at the next site would demand a lot less.

-Mike

Cool - yeah, I'd looked into SAML, just wante dto get the group's take on
if that's how people are actually doing it (something getting declared a
standards body standard and actual adoption being largely unrelated).  It
kinda bypasses the issue of transferring any customer daata to the partner

Ernest,

Implementing SAML authentication assumes that the user's identity can be
mapped to an existing user in the remote service provider's repository. This
can be 1:1 mapping or a 1:many mapping using a system account. Since you may
or may not have the user in the remote repository you would have to map to a
system account to implement SAML. But if the remote application needs the
user's information using system accounts probably isn't possible.

One approach could be to build a custom application that sends all of the
user's information in a secure manner to the remote application on logon.
This could be done using signed/encrypted cookies that the remote
application would have to consume or the authenticating application (aka
identity provider) would have to make a backend call to insert the users
information in the remote application if it's not already there. Either of
these solutions is going impact the performance of your system.

A better approach is to use an identity management system to synchronize
user's identity with the remote systems they need access to before they try
to access it. This will free you up to implementing single sign-on using
SAML or using an access management/SSO appliance that can authenticate the
user to the remote application using its native authentication mechanism
(for instance form-based authentication, BA authentication or Kerberos).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Thad Smith

Something we have done in the past that may or may not work for you is
to create a hand-off form post containing a set of key/value pairs with
the info you want to transfer.  We also include a timestamp and did some
other stuff to increase randomness.  This post data was encrypted by the
sending site by an AES key shared between the sender and the receiver.
The receiver web site receives the POST, unpacks and decrypts the data
and then makes a decision about whether they want to honor the
authentication and what permissions the user should have on the system.

So on the Sender site you would have a FORM like this:

<FORM action='http://destination/receiver.jsp'>
    <input type='hidden' name='userinfo' value='(Encrypted stuff here)'
/>
    <input type='submit' />
</FORM>

The user on the Sender site clicks the Submit button and is taken to the
destination site.  The destination site decrypts the "userinfo" field to
find:

User=dcornell
Timestamp=x:y:z
And so on...

This accomplished similar stuff to SAML but was a little simpler and
lighter weight.  It has the "disadvantage" of not being WS-Whatever
standards based but worked well for us given the situation's
requirements.  The sender and receiver have to manage their AES keys
through a different channel, but using that as a shared secret to
"federate" the authentication worked for our purposes.  There was a
little bit more to it than this, but hopefully this gives you the basic
idea.

Thanks,

Dan

Ernest,

In HP, an application does authorization, but NOT authentication.
Authentication is provided by a centralized service, which an
application has to program to use it.  This way, an application doesn't
involve in user account management (approval account or remove account
if a user leaves company), password length, complexity, expiration,
reset, etc.  

Thanks.
Betty

Hiya...

I came out today - late - but wasn't able to find where you were
having the meeting.  I went to Whole Foods Customer Service but of
course they had no idea what OWASP was.

I see now that I was supposed to sign in with some kind of
receptionist; I recall seeing a business office of some kind on the
top floor; I assume this receptionist was in there somewhere?

I've got 1 yes and 3 maybes for attending next month...

By the way, I may be giving a talk on my Dynamic Firewall Daemon
project at "Austin Hackers Anonymous" tomorrow:

The project is described here:
