OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, May 31st from 11:30 AM to
1:00 PM


*The ABCs of Source-Assisted Web Application Penetration Testing With OWASP
ZAP: Attack Surface, Backdoors, and Configuration*


There are a number of reasons to use source code to assist in web
application penetration testing such as making better use of penetration
testers&#8217; time, providing penetration testers with deeper insight into
system behavior, and highlighting specific sections of so development teams
can remediate vulnerabilities faster. Examples of these are provided using
the open source ThreadFix plugin for the OWASP ZAP proxy and dynamic
application security testing tool. These show opportunities attendees have
to enhance their own penetration tests given access to source code.


This presentation covers the &#8220;ABCs&#8221; of source code assisted web application
penetration testing: covering issues of attack surface enumeration,
backdoor identification, and configuration issue discovery. Having access
to the source lets an attacker enumerate all of the URLs and parameters an
application exposes &#8211; essentially its attack surface. Knowing these allows
pen testers greater application coverage during testing. In addition,
access to source code can help to identify potential backdoors that have
been intentionally added to the system. Comparing the results of blind
spidering to a full attack surface model can identify items of interest
such as hidden admin consoles or secret backdoor parameters. Finally, the
presentation examines how access to source code can help identify
configuration settings that may have an adverse impact on the security of
the deployed application.


*Speaker: *Dan Cornell
