Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Rapid7


*When:*  Thursday, May 12th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm


*Where: *Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd).  We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.


*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.


*Sponsor:* Rapid7
