<PRE>Hello everyone!

As a reminder, the *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *for June is
coming up next week, Thursday, July 13th.  If you have not already done so,
please RSVP so we can get a good indication of how many will be attending.
Here are the details:

*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for **June*

*When:* Thursday, July 13th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where:* Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd). We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

*Sponsor:* Technology Navigators

*Technology Navigators is a technical staffing firm specialized in
recruiting skilled technologists for project-oriented consulting and
contract positions. We&#8217;ve been firmly rooted in the Austin technology
community since 1999, and have been providing companies that develop,
build, and use technology with the people they need to grow their business
for over 15 years**.*


*RSVP:* <A HREF="https://aus-sec-happy-hour-2017-07.eventbrite.com">https://aus-sec-happy-hour-2017-07.eventbrite.com</A>



Also, we are still in the process of preparing for *LASCON 2017*, which
will be at the end of October.  Below are the details, as well as
opportunities for discounted conference tickets.

*LASCON 2017*

*When:* Thursday &amp; Friday, October 26-27, 2017

*Where:* Norris Conference Center, 2525 W. Anderson Lane, Suite 365,
Austin, Texas 78757

*What: *The Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) is an OWASP
conference held annually in Austin, TX. It is a gathering of 400+ web app
developers, security engineers, mobile developers and information security
professionals. LASCON is held in Texas where more Fortune 500 companies
call home than any other state, and is held in Austin which is a hub for
startups in the state of Texas. At LASCON, leaders at these companies along
with security architects and developers gather to share cutting-edge ideas,
initiatives, and technology advancements.

Following are options for receiving a *discounted conference registration*:


   - *OWASP Member*
      - If you are an OWASP Member, you can register and receive a discount
      on your ticket. Normally $349, discounted at $279 ... that is a
savings of
      *$70*!
      - You will need your OWASP Membership Number.  If you do not know it,
      log in to the OWASP Foundation Community Portal (
      <A HREF="https://myowasp.force.com/login">https://myowasp.force.com/login</A>), go to Profile, and your Membership
      Number will be listed.

      require you to enter your Membership Number.


   - *Non-Member*
      - Not currently an OWASP Member?  For a limited time we are offering
      a *$50 discount* to those on this OWASP Austin list.
      - We would, however, like to encourage you to become an OWASP

      supporting our local chapter, but you would get the additional discount
      amount.  To become a member, go to
