Howdy Austin OWASPers!

There is a whole lot of happenings going on with the chapter!  Happy hour,
chapter meetings, study groups, and the upcoming LASCON -- which is open
for registration and has its CFP ready too!

----  Next Week!!!
*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Lumenate, June 12th*

When: Thursday, June 12th, 5-7PM
Where: Sherlocks Street Pub and Grill 9012 Research Blvd

What: The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.  (No chapter or organization membership is needed to attend.)

Sponsor:  *Lumenate *is a technical consulting firm that helps clients
solve their most challenging business problems. They combine the brightest,
experienced talent with proven and longstanding manufacturing partnerships
to provide expert solutions across the following practice disciplines:
? Storage | Virtualization
? Security | Compliance
? Networking | Collaboration
? Managed Services
"This service driven approach allows the team of technical consultants to
design and implement customized, integrated solutions that enhance IT?s
value to your business.
*Business Model Flexibility*
Business has changed. We now work and learn from any location, with any
device, at any time. Improving collaboration with students, customers and
colleagues while driving down risk and operational cost is the
responsibility of modern IT. Our breadth of expertise means we architect
the right solution (not necessarily the latest one) while leveraging your
current investments. We deliver real value by employing the benefits of
virtualization while promoting security and scalability."

*OWASP monthly meeting on June 24th*
11:30AM to 1PM -- food and socializing first, meeting starts around 11:45
*Location: *National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Title: Railsgoat*
Abstract: While working to secure rails applications in a truly Agile
development environment, it became clear that the Rails and Ruby ecosystem
needed attention from the security community in the form of free and open
training. RailsGoat is an attempt to bring attention to both the problems
that most frequently occur in Rails as well as solutions for remediation.
This talk will discuss Railsgoat, common issues, defensive measures, and
engage the audience for feedback/improvements.

*Speakers: *
*Mike McCabe *is the Director of Professional Services at nVisium. In his
free time he likes to build and hack on open source projects. He's a big
fan of Burp and set -o vi in his bash profile. Mike also serves as a board
member for the OWASP NoVa chapter.
*Ken Johnson *is the CTO of nVisium and leads the company's product
development efforts. Ken is obsessed with code security and code in general
but holds a special place in his heart for Ruby. Ken is passionate about
the open source community, and genuinely loves to create.

may take place!

Subject: [Owasp-austin] WFH for a stay-at-home-mom
Message-ID: <CAMjHtBrevXpqW_cfEYqmjbFdjpT_-7b8BZ+MktzFY5kSLes=yw@mail.gmail.com>

(I posted this to AHA as well.  Sorry AHA peeps for the crosspost.)
Hey guys,

I know a lot of you work from home and have spouses / significant others
who do the same.  Our kids aren't babies anymore, and my wife is looking
for something to do from home.  She homeschools the kids part of the day,
so flexible hours would kinda be a must.

She's technical, but not uber-geek like us.  So she doesn't code, program,
etc., but she can type faster than almost anyone I know, work around any
piece of software, learn new things, get around just fine on a computer,
etc.  She did some website development in the pre-CSS days, has an
excellent grasp on grammar, spelling, and all the important things.

Bottom line:  She is a really smart chick with a wicked sense of humor, and
I'm not just saying that because she's my wife.

She'd also make a good telephonic social engineer as well, in my opinion.
Heck, she SE'd me into marrying her, so there's that.  (just kidding).

She's been kinda down on herself because she doesn't have a college
degree.  I said that shouldn't matter, considering how smart she actually
is.

If you guys have any lines on any kind of work, she's all ears.  You can
contact me directly at josh at radixtx.com with any information.

Thanks guys!

Subject: [Owasp-austin] ModSecurity Expert?
Message-ID: <CAFwvDey2WSuOAQ11WLBWmm9i_4Pz_gtCYtyHgKMFk-bC9wAYMg@mail.gmail.com>

It seems that I may have a project at National Instruments that would
necessitate using ModSecurity rules primarily for virtual patching and
perhaps some exploit detection for a singular application.  I'm wondering
if anyone on our list specializes in consulting with ModSecurity
implementations.  Ideally, I'm looking for someone who can review a list of
vulnerabilities, generate relevant patch rules, and add some additional
alerting for detection and exploitation of similar types of
vulnerabilities.  I don't imagine it will take a lot of time, but my team
is small enough that we'd like to leverage the time and expertise of
someone else to get it going.  Do you have any recommendations?  Please
respond to me in private so as not to SPAM the rest of the list.  Thanks!
