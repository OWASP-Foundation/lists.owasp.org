<PRE>Howdy folks,

Don't forget about the chapter meeting next Tuesday!   Sign-ups for on-site
people end on Friday at noon (gotta have time to order food).  Please don't
be one of the people who shows up at the chapter meeting without signing
up, you might not get food.  Sign-up here --

*When:* Tuesday, August 25th @ 11:45 - 1PM

*Title:* Eat Your Own Dogfood

As security professionals, we have made it our jobs to tell other people
how to be secure. We preach security in everything from applications to
systems to networks and more. We get more and more frustrated with each and
every issue that we find and sometimes even angry when others aren't fixing
things fast enough. But, with all of the berating that we do of others for
their security downfalls, how many of us actually put in the time and
effort to do things right ourselves? And what happens when those people who
we are trying to teach see us not practicing what we preach? Security
begins and ends with you. It's time to start eating your own dogfood.

*Speaker:* Josh Sokol

Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a
BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several
large companies, including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a
military contractor, and is currently employed as the Information Security
Program Owner at National Instruments. In his current role, Sokol manages
all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability
management activities for NI. Sokol created the free and open source risk
management tool named SimpleRisk, has spoken on dozens of security topics
including the much-hyped &#8220;HTTPSCan Byte Me&#8221; talk at Black Hat 2010, and
currently serves on the OWASP Global Board of Directors.

*Food:* It will be a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough
for all!

Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

*Location:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Or if you can not attend we should be broadcasting the meeting GoToMeeting
