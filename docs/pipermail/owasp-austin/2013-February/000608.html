<PRE>Hey Austin OWASPers,


iSEC has added Austin to the list of cities where it will be holding
quarterly &quot;Open Forum&quot; events and the inaugural event will be taking place
a week from tomorrow (Thursday, March 7).  This event is FREE and open to
any InfoSec Technical Managers and Engineers who are interested.  Food and
beverages will be provided.  It will be held downtown at Buffalo Billiards
and this month features micro-presentations from Bill Leddy (Principle
Security Strategist, Paypal), Anson Gomes and Jonathan Chittenden (Security
Engineers, iSEC), and myself.  While I have never been to one of these
before, it sounds like an interesting group with some decent content.  More
details are below.  I hope to see you there!


Sincerely,


Josh Sokol

*Agenda

SPEAKERS: Bill Leddy / Principle Security Strategist / PayPal


PRESO TITLE: FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)


PRESO SUMMARY: The recently announced FIDO Alliance (see
www.fidoalliance.org) intends to enable a broader range of strong
authentication options, user choice, and lower costs with a non-proprietary
approach to authentication. The FIDO approach is to enable BYOD (Bring Your
Own Device) through dynamic discovery of authentication tokens at end
points, using third party attestation to validate these tokens. The
presentation will cover the business and technical motivation for End
Users, Relying Parties, Security Token Vendors and Integrators. A
high-level overview of the proposed architecture will be presented and
example FIDO user interactions will be shown. How FIDO can be used in
conjunction with Risk Based Authentication to create a streamlined
experience for many transactions will be discussed.


SPEAKER BIO(S): Bill Leddy is currently a Principle Security Strategist at
PayPal, where he has been focused primarily on Risk Based Authentication,
new authentication options and FIDO. Bill has been at PayPal for almost 6
years. Prior to that he has been VPE and/or Technical Product Manager at
multiple startup companies in the Austin area, but unfortunately only a few
have had modest success. Bill&#8217;s background is primarily in distributed
computing (DCE, InfiniBand) and Security (Host Intrusion Detection,
Authentication). Bill was in the Parallel Processing group at MCC during
its heyday where he was the first users of the GNU C++ Compiler. Bill has a
BSEE and BACS from Rice University a long time ago.

SPEAKERS: Anson Gomes / Security Engineer / iSEC Partners &amp; Jonathan
Chittenden / Senior Security Engineer / iSEC Partners


PRESO TITLE: Untwining Twine


PRESO SUMMARY: Kevin Ashton was the first to coin the term &quot;internet of
things&quot;, and pointed out that data on the Internet was mostly created by
humans in 1999. Things have changed considerably since then - many
appliances ship with embedded systems that can be remotely monitored, Lou
Bega's Mambo No. 5 is no longer on the radio, and the smart home is
something that both excites and terrifies us.

Twine is a consumer device that allows you to remotely monitor its
environment through a variety of sensors (like moisture or vibration).
We're offering a sneak peek of our analysis of Twine, and will lead you
through the steps taken to understand what's going on under the hood of a
&quot;blackbox&quot; device. We'll talk about what we've found so far, discuss the
challenges we overcame, the challenges we still face, and how you can use
these techniques on tweeting refrigerators (and similar devices). Topics
include: capturing traffic on a non-proxy aware device, pulling and reverse
engineering the firmware, and analyzing opaque binary traffic.


SPEAKER BIO(S): Anson Gomes is a security consultant/researcher at
iSECPartners, an information security firm specializing in
application,
network, and mobile security. At iSEC, Anson specializes in network and
application security testing and has been tasked with a wide variety of
engagements.  Anson is comfortable with external as well as internal
network security assessments. He has also performed several application
assessments in programming languages such as Java, .NET and PHP.

Prior to working at iSEC, Anson worked as a software developer. In this
role he built applications and performed both vulnerability assessments and
penetration tests. Anson graduated with a M.S. in Computer Science from
NYU: Polytechnic focusing on Security and a B.E. in Computer Engineering
from Mumbai, India.


SPEAKER BIO(S): Prior to his employment with iSEC, Jonathan Chittenden
worked for the Air Force as a civilian. His roles consisted of reverse
engineering malware for both signature and exploitation development. This
experience enabled Jonathan to be comfortable working at a low-level with
unknown protocols and binaries. During this time, he also assisted in the
development of an open-source intelligence application to be used to
identify indicators of compromise.

During his employment with iSEC Partners, Jonathan has been tasked with a
variety of engagements. Of which his memorable projects include code
reviewing custom kernel modules to be used for virtualization and reverse
engineering Android applications. Jonathan has also collaborated and
presented on a tool called AWS Scout. Scout helps automate security
assessments of several Amazon Web Services. The tool was showcased at
Blackhat USA 2012 Arsenal and OWASP AppSec 2012 conference.

Jonathan graduated with a M.S. in Cyber Security from NYU: Polytechnic and
a BBA in Infrastructure Assurance and Information Security from UTSA.

SPEAKER: Josh Sokol / Information Security Program Owner / National
Instruments


PRESO TITLE: The Magic of Symbiotic Security: Creating an Ecosystem of
Security Systems


PRESO SUMMARY: Throw out everything that you know about security tools
today. No more six-figure appliances that only do one thing marginally
well. No more proprietary protocols. We deserve better and we demand
better. Envision a world where your security tools talk with each other.
They communicate and share data in order to leverage each others strengths
and help compensate for their weaknesses. They work together to solve
problems. Envision &quot;Symbiotic Security&quot;.

Symbiotic Security is a new term that was coined to describe the ability of
a tool to consume data from other tools or provide data to other tools. As
part of our research, we have examined various classes of tools on the
market and identified these abilities in each of them resulting in a label
of &quot;Consumer&quot;, &quot;Provider&quot;, or &quot;Symbiotic&quot;. As a consumer of security tools,
this completely revolutionizes the way that we make purchases.  Like any
new concept it can take some time to embrace, but we feel certain that
labeling tools according to their abilities as &quot;Consumers&quot; and &quot;Providers&quot;
can help to facilitate a much needed turn towards openness in our industry.
Vendors will get the message that consumers want to select tools that work
together in order to achieve their maximum effectiveness. Consumers will
get the added value of having tools that work outside of their silos to
make their jobs more efficient and maximize their ROI. Please join us in
embracing this bold new concept.


SPEAKER BIO: Josh Sokol, CISSP, graduated from the University of Texas at
Austin with a BS in Computer Science in 2002.  Since that time, he has
worked for several large companies including AMD and BearingPoint, spent
some time as a military contractor, and is currently employed as the
Information Security Program Owner at National Instruments.  In his current
role, Josh manages all compliance, security architecture, risk management,
and vulnerability management activities for NI.  Josh currently serves as
the Chair of the OWASP Global Chapters Committee and is very active in the
Austin security community.  He holds a CISSP certification and has spoken
on dozens of security topics including the much hyped &quot;HTTPSCan Byte Me&quot;
talk at BlackHat 2010.

About the iSEC Open Security Forum


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


The iSEC Open Security Forum is an informal and open venue for the
discussion and presentation of security related research and tools, and an
opportunity for security researchers from all fields to get together and
share work and ideas. The Forum meets quarterly in the Bay Area, Seattle,
New York City and Austin. Forum agendas are crafted with the specific
needs/interests of its members in mind and consist of brief 30-40 minute
talks. Talks are not product pitches or strongly vendor preferential.
Attendance is by invite only and is limited to engineers and technical
managers. Any area of security is welcome including reversing, secure
development, new techniques or tools, application security, cryptography,
etc.
