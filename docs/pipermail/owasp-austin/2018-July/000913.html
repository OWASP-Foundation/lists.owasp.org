<PRE>Hello everyone!



The *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *for July is *tomorrow,
Thursday, July 12th*.  We will be at Baby A's on Stonelake Blvd in North
Austin.


*Note that we do NOT have a sponsor for this happy hour.  That means we all
will be on our own to pay for any food or drinks.*


Here are the details:


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for July*

*When:* Thursday, June 12th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where: *Baby A's, 9505-B Stonelake Blvd, Austin, Texas 78759 (corner of
Stonelake and York Blvd, between Hwy 183 and Mopac).  We will meet in the
area inside the restaurant, in the far left corner.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters. We try
to meet every second Thursday of the month from January to September (but
occasionally we make schedule adjustments when needed). The event is an
informal social gathering of local information security professionals. If
you're involved with InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out
to network with other like-minded folks.

*Sponsor:  None for this month*

Because this is a very late email going out, no need for an RSVP.

I hope to see you all there.
