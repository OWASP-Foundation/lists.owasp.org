<PRE>*When: *April 29th, 2008, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Who: *Mano Paul, CEO of Express Certifications and SecuRisk Solutions
Before Express Certifications and SecuRisk Solutions, Mano played several
roles from software developer, quality assurance tester, logistics manager,
technical architect, IT strategist and Security Engineer/Program
Manager/Strategist at Dell Inc. His security experience includes designing
and developing software security programs from Compliance-to-Coding,
application security risk management, security strategy &amp; management, and
conducting security awareness training and education. Mano is an appointed
Industry representative of Information Systems Security Association (ISSA)
Capitol of Texas chapter. He is also a selected faculty member for the ISSA
security course at the local university. Mano has been featured in various
domestic and international security conferences, contributed to and
published various security articles and is an invited speaker in the CSI
(Computer Security Institute), Burton Group Catalyst, TRISC and the OWASP
Application Security Conferences. He is also a contributing author for the
Information Security Management Handbook, writes periodically for the
Certification Magazine and has contributed to several security topics for
the Microsoft Solutions Developer Network.

*Topic:* Software Security &#8211; The Road Less Travelled.  What do you think
Shakespeare had to say about Software Security? What does an naked motorist
have to do with Confidentiality? What does the Jungle Book character Baloo
have to say about Security Essentials (The Bear Bare Necessities of Life
security)? What does the African Wildlife have to do with Security Concepts?
What does pH have to do with Security? and more &#8230;

The Road Less Travelled by renowed poet, Robert Frost ends by with the
statement &quot;And that has made all the difference&quot;. Come to find out the
answers to the questions above and see what it takes to look at Security
from a different perspective, that would make ALL the difference. The
session will cover not only the higher level abstractions of security
concepts, but will dive deep wherever applicable into concepts and code,
making it a MUST attend for Development, QA, PM and Management Staff on both
the IT and Business side.

*Where: *National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building C which is the
tallest building on campus (8 levels). There will be signs posted in the
