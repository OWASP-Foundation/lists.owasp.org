------------------------------------------------------------


OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, February 28th from 11:30
AM to 1:00 PM


*Building and Breaking Password Reset Mechanisms*


It happens to everyone, you forgot your password. Now you need to get back
into your account and prove you are who you say, but without using your
password as proof. How, then, can that be done securely? More
interestingly, how can it be done insecurely? This talk will dissect a
number of security vulnerabilities found in real-world password reset
mechanisms, and discuss how password reset mechanisms should be built.


*Speaker: *Dan Crowley


Daniel Crowley is a Senior Security Engineer and Regional Research Director
for NCC Group Austin, tasked with finding and exploiting flaws in
everything from Web applications and cryptosystems to ATMs, smart homes,
and industrial control systems. He denies all allegations of unicorn
smuggling and questions your character for even suggesting it. He has been
working in information security since 2004. Daniel is TIME?s 2006 Person of
the Year. He has developed and released various free security tools such as
MCIR, a powerful Web application exploitation training and research
platform, and FeatherDuster, an automated modular cryptanalysis tool. He
does his own charcuterie and brews his own beer. He is a frequent speaker
at conferences including Black Hat, DEFCON, Shmoocon, Chaos Communications
Camp, and SOURCE. Daniel can open a door lock with his computer but still
can?t launch ICBMs by whistling into a phone. He has been interviewed by
various print and television media including Forbes, CNN, and the Wall
Street Journal. He holds the noble title of Baron in the micronation of
Sealand. His work has been included in books and college courses.
