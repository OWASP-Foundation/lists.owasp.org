Subject: [Owasp-austin] Interview about OWASP Live CD now available
Message-ID: <4964EB63.7030309@gmail.com>

"Austin OWASP chapter member interviewed"
I was asked by Jim Manico to be interviewed as part of the OWASP Podcast
series.  We recorded the interview on December 30th and the final
version was posted last night.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Podcast_3

If you've ever wondered what I was thinking and where I'd like to see
the OWASP Live CD go, here's your chance - in about 25 minutes of audio.
 Give it a listen and bring any questions or comments you may have to
the OWASP Live CD release party on February 5th.  More details to follow...

Also, the series has been good so far and I encourage you to listen to
the past episodes and add the podcast to your favorite podcatching
client (e.g. iTunes, gpodder, ...).
