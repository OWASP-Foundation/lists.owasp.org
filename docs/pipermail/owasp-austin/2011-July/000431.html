<PRE>Hey Josh,

I am 1000% in on the full-day with Raphael before LASCON.  Even if I can't get my company to pay for it, I'm in ... sounds like pure gold in terms of security training.

You know, I probably don't say this enough, but thanks for bringing these types of events to our community--you rock!  I'm always telling my security buddies who aren't in Austin about how good the sessions are here, and it's because of your dedication and effort that we get such good sessions.  So thanks a lot man, take a minute to pat yourself (and James and Ben too) on the back!!

Thanks:)
Matt S.

After months of trying to get Rapid7 on board for our Penetration Testing with Metasploit Half-Day Seminar, it looks like they've decided that the idea was good enough to run with it on their own.  So for anyone who didn't make it out to the training for whatever reason, here's an excellent opportunity for you to hear about Metasploit for free.  It's next week (7/13) and seating is very limited so act fast if you're interested.

As a side note, we're working with Raphael Mudge to potentially offer a full-day Advanced Penetration Testing with Metasploit course the day before LASCON (10/27).  It unfortunately wouldn't be free as we'd have to pay for the conference center facilities and Raphael's expenses, but it should be cheap.  Let me know if you're available on that day and would be interested in attending for probably ~$200.
