<PRE>Fellow OWASPers,

Hopefully by now you've heard the buzz around last year's Lonestar 
Application Security Conference (LASCON).  The conference was hosted by 
the Austin OWASP Chapter and featured some of the world's top security 
researchers including Robert &quot;RSnake&quot; Hansen, Samy Kamkar, Joe Jarzombek, 
and many more.  In it's first year, LASCON had over 160 attendees and the 
feedback was outstanding.  Here's just a few of examples of what 2010 
LASCON attendees had to say about the conference:
With the lineup of presenters that you have for the LASCON Conference, I 
can't afford not to go. 
- Ian Robertson 

Just wanted to drop the LASCON organizers a note about how much I enjoyed 
the conference last Friday. Good venue, good food, good presentations, and 
good people. 
- Joel Burrow 

Thanks for understanding how us geeks think and putting on a conference 
that we can really enjoy being a part of. 
- Jay Paz 

With so much positive feedback coming out of LASCON 2010 it was a no 
brainer for our team to do it again this year.  We've already received 
commitments from Jeremiah Grossman, John Steven, Michael Howard, and many 
more.  Needless to say, this year's conference is gonna rock and we want 
you to be a part of it!  We've got special Early-Bird Pricing good through 
the end of July.  For the next two weeks OWASP members can attend LASCON 
for only $75.  Non-members can attend LASCON for $125 and that includes a 
$50 OWASP membership of which 40% goes to support your local chapter.  You 
may have missed out on last year's conference, but you won't want to miss 
what we have in store for LASCON 2011 happening October 28, 2011 at the 
Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX.  And be sure to plan on sticking 
around for the LASCON Happy Hour sponsored by Trustwave.  The mechanical 
bull is back!  We'll see you at LASCON!

Register for LASCON today at <A HREF="http://www.regonline.com/lascon2011">http://www.regonline.com/lascon2011</A>

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol &amp; James Wickett
LASCON 2011 Co-Chairs
