<PRE>Since the date of TRISC conflicts with when we would normally be doing the 
July OWASP meeting, we have decided to go ahead and cancel the OWASP 
meeting.  The good news is that instead of the hour of security that you 
would get at OWASP, you get over two days of content at TRISC.  I've 
negotiated with TRISC to become a sponsor of this year's conference so 
that all of you can attend the conference at a discounted rate.  Just tell 
them that you're an Austin OWASP members when you sign up to receive the 
discounted price.

The early-bird pricing discount has now ended, but TRISC has something new 
for you.  Now if you register two people for TRISC, you save $200!  You 
remember that security conscious friend of yours who you forgot to get a 
birthday present?  Why not use this deal to register them for TRISC as 
well and save?!?!  TRISC is July 24-26 at the Airport Hilton here in 
Austin.  They've got some terrific keynote speakers and you can even come 
and see me, Wickett, and even David Hughes talk about stuff.  For more 
information, check out <A HREF="http://www.trisc.org.">http://www.trisc.org.</A>  See you there!
