<PRE>After months of trying to get Rapid7 on board for our Penetration Testing 
with Metasploit Half-Day Seminar, it looks like they've decided that the 
idea was good enough to run with it on their own.  So for anyone who 
didn't make it out to the training for whatever reason, here's an 
excellent opportunity for you to hear about Metasploit for free.  It's 
next week (7/13) and seating is very limited so act fast if you're 
interested.

As a side note, we're working with Raphael Mudge to potentially offer a 
full-day Advanced Penetration Testing with Metasploit course the day 
before LASCON (10/27).  It unfortunately wouldn't be free as we'd have to 
pay for the conference center facilities and Raphael's expenses, but it 
should be cheap.  Let me know if you're available on that day and would be 
interested in attending for probably ~$200.
