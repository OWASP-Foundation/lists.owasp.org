Austin OWASPers,

I've had a couple of potential presenters for our August and September 
meetings fall through and I wanted to throw it out there to the group.  I 
know that a lot of you are working on cool stuff at the moment that maybe 
you would want to share with the rest of us?  Maybe you know someone who 
would be a great presenter for our meetings?  If so, please shoot me an 
e-mail and tell me about it.  Thanks!

Sincerely,

	8/18/2011

Austin OWASPers,

I hope that everyone who went to Vegas this past week made it safely back 
to Austin with a ton of new ideas and only some minor sleep deprivation. I 
spent my days at the Las Vegas BSides event and I was thoroughly impressed 
by the venue, speakers, and the organization behind the event.  I would 
highly recommend attending next year if you can find a way to swing it. 
One of the coolest new tools that I saw at BSides was called Agnitio (
http://sourceforge.net/projects/agnitiotool/).  It's a tool to help 
developers and security professionals conduct manual security code reviews 
in a consistent and repeatable way.  It uses the targets that Keith Turpin 
talked to us about in the June meeting on the OWASP Secure Coding 
Practices Quick Reference Guide, but displays them as checklists in a tool 
that can be used to audit and track the progress of an application over 
time.  Check it out!

I wanted to make sure to give everyone a heads up that the Austin Security 
Professionals Happy Hour will not be this week as it originally had been 
on the schedule.  I have pushed it instead to next week in order to 1) fit 
better with our sponsors schedule and 2) allow us all a chance to sober up 
from Vegas.  So please join us all out at Sherlock's for our regular happy 
hour event on Thursday, August 18 from 5 to 7 PM thanks to our sponsor, 
Set Solutions.  As always, this is an excellent opportunity for you to 
enjoy food and drinks while networking with your fellow security 
professionals from Austin and the surrounding areas.  Please RSVP via the 
link below:

See you soon!

 Austin OWASP Meeting (Please RSVP)

Austin OWASPers,

I am please to announce our next OWASP meeting on August 30, 2011 from 
11:30 to 1:00 PM.  In order to prevent us from running out of food at this 
meeting as we did last time, I would like to request that everyone who 
plans on attending RSVP's via the link provided below.  Our new policy 
will be that up until 11:45, the only people who will be allowed to get 
food are the ones on the RSVP list.  I will do my best to order food for 
everyone, but after 11:45 it's fair game and if we run out, we run out. In 
other words, if you plan on coming you should RSVP if you want to ensure 
you get to eat.

RSVP Here -->  http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2064867073

When: August 30, 2011, 11:30am - 1:00pm 
Topic: Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure Your 
Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors & Data 
Exfiltration
With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries, 
it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and 
security of the software running its business critical applications. As a 
result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the 
prevalent attack vector used by hackers. Whether you manage internal 
development activities, work with third party developers or are developing 
a COTS application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your 
code and make applications security a priority for internal and external 
development teams. 
In this session we will cover: 
Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks 
Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your 
applications 
Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities 
Who: Joe Brady (Veracode) 
Joe Brady is a Senior Solutions Architect at Veracode with over 25 years 
of experience in software application development and security. His 
professional experience includes advising customers on data at rest 
encryption solutions at Credant Technology, IT risk and portfolio 
management at Prosight (now Oracle), and application software development 
as a consultant and software development manager for various companies. 
Joe began programming as a physics undergrad and developed early 
microprocessor based instrumentation at Cornell, where he received a 
Master of Science degree in Applied and Engineering Physics. He has had an 
interest in software security, and backdoors in particular, since reading 
?Reflections on Trusting Trust? by Ken Thompson where he describes 
planting what we now call a backdoor in the UNIX compiler.
Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building C which is the 
tallest building on campus (8 levels). There will be signs posted in the 
lobby to direct you where to go and the receptionists will be able to 
assist you as well. See directions to National Instruments. 
Cost: Always Free

Also, don't forget about tonight's Austin Security Professionals Happy 
Hour from 5-7 PM at Sherlocks.  See you there!

Austin OWASPers,

Please don't forget to RSVP to see Joe Brady from Veracode talk about 
"Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors" at the OWASP meeting next 
Tuesday (8/30) if you want to ensure that you get to eat.  Our new policy 
will be that up until 11:45, the only people who will be allowed to get 
food are the ones on the RSVP list.  RSVP Here -->  
http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2064867073

We have completed the CFP's for LASCON 2011 speakers and should be 
announcing the list of presentations at the next OWASP meeting on Tuesday. 
 Be sure to get there early to get your preview of the awesomeness of our 
LASCON 2011 lineup!

If you can't make LASCON for some reason or have a little bit of spare 
change floating around in your training budget, you should seriously 
consider coming with me to check out HouSecCon.  It is taking place on 
November 3, 2011 in Houston, TX and registration is only $25 for a bunch 
of great speakers!!!  Huge props to David Nester and Michael Farnum for 
putting on a conference that rivals LASCON for value.  To register, go to 
http://houstonseccon.com/ and look for the Registration link on the main 
menu.  Then send me a quick note if you're interested in carpooling to 
Houston like we did last year.

See you Tuesday!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
