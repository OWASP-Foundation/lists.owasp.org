<PRE>Texas OWASPers,

I think many of you know me already from various events around Texas.  I am
based in Austin and run the Security Program for National Instruments.  My
first term on the OWASP Board of Directors is ending and I have decided to
run again.  Over my first term I accomplished many of the things that I
originally set out to do, including several Bylaw changes, and am in the
process of pushing out a massive reform that will help tremendously getting
new chapters and projects started and hopefully eliminate all of the
negativity around &quot;rich chapters vs poor chapters&quot; going forward.

On Wednesday all OWASP members (those who paid for or received honorary
membership which includes pretty much anyone who attended LASCON last year)
should have received an e-mail from <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">vote at simplyvoting.com</A> with a link to
vote in the OWASP elections.  If you are a registered member
&lt;<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tu2MAdu1xNq8RTaqHWMSb_0qM_OE6aaVgKB54q_fQIs/edit#gid=994492234">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tu2MAdu1xNq8RTaqHWMSb_0qM_OE6aaVgKB54q_fQIs/edit#gid=994492234</A>&gt;,
then you should have received the e-mail below.  If you did not, please
search your SPAM filters or reach out to the OWASP staff to get that fixed
ASAP.

I'm not one for politicking, but I did want to reach out and let you know
that as we enter into this election, I continue to have our chapters' best
interests at heart.  I sincerely hope that you will consider voting for me
in the 2015 OWASP Global Board of Directors Election.  As always, please
feel free to reach out if you have any questions or problems that I can
help with.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
