<PRE>Howdy OWASP Austinites!

Spring is here and events are in full swing in OWASP Austin and other local
groups.  OWASP Austin has already had great chapter meetings this year
(Thank you Matt, Earl, and all the CryptoParty speakers!) and our amazing
sponsors for the happy hours  (Thank you again Fishnet, Qualys, Alert
Logic, and iSEC Partners!).   It is strange to think that already 1/4 of
the year is gone.  Come out to OWASP Austin events!

OWASP Austin March Chapter Meeting
When: Tuesday, April 28th @ 11:45 - 1PM
Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac. Building C

Title: Using OpenSAMM for Benchmarking and Software Security Improvement

We all know that behind every breach story in the press is an organization
that probably should have done more to build secure software. Yet,
organizations struggle mightily to focus resources on building software
securely from the outset and, as a result, software security remains an
after the fact &#8220;nice to do&#8221; and not a &#8220;have to do&#8221; activity in many
organizations. How can organizations determine the right sets of activities
or appropriate resource allocation levels that it should undertake to
adequately address software risk? Organizations can make these
determinations by benchmarking via OWASP&#8217;s Open Software Assurance Maturity
Model (OpenSAMM) framework.

A coalition of leading application security industry vendors recently
contributed benchmarking data in order to enhance OpenSAMM and its
assessment framework. These efforts will enable organizations to step up
their software security game and identify hurdles by using OpenSAMM as a
powerful benchmarking tool. John will provide details on an ongoing
industry effort to improve OpenSAMM by providing more comparative data to
encourage broader use throughout industry.

Speaker: John Dickson

John Dickson is an internationally recognized security leader, entrepreneur
and Principal at Denim Group, Ltd. He has nearly 20 years hands-on
