SPEAKER: Derek Hinch, Security Engineer at iSEC Partners 

PRESO TITLE: Advanced Replay Attacks using bouncyDuck 

PRESO SUMMARY: When time on an unauthorized terminal counts, replay attacks
can be some of the most efficient methods for target acquisition. Devices
such as the teensy HID and USB Rubber Ducky can be quite useful, however,
the default firmware is lacking in features. bouncyDuck is a simple script
that manages programming of multiple firmware types for the USB Rubber
Ducky, along with additional tools that allow payload customization in the
field with little to no knowledge of the ducky scripting language (does not
require a network connection either). This short talk will provide an
overview of each one of the types of firmware contained in bouncyDuck, the
best use case scenarios, and some of the features of the bouncyDuck tool
along with demonstrations of each. 

SPEAKER BIO: Derek has been involved in offensive security research for more
than 20 years. He is a former USAF Electronic Warfare R&amp;D specialist (SEI
084/AFSC 2A071D), SIPRNET Domain Admin, and is currently senior staff at
DEFCON - where he runs the DEFCON Groups initiative, as well as serving as a
veteran DEFCON Security Goon. In his spare time he meddles in persistent
threat development, cryptography, and forensics. Derek has been a court
certified expert witness in Computers, Computer Security, and Digital
Forensics for computers and phones for more than 5 years. 

&quot;In God We Trust. All others, we monitor - jam - and deceive.&quot; Pax Per
Imperium

SPEAKER: Jeremy Powell

PRESO TITLE: Software Defined Radio Primer

PRESO SUMMARY: SDR is a powerful technology that has recently become cheap
enough to for individuals to hack on. However, there's a steep learning
curve since it's fairly new and intersects many different disciplines. This
presentation will give you an overview of what SDR is, what technology is
available, and the vocabulary needed to start learning for yourself.

SPEAKER BIO: Jeremy has worked in the field of information security for
seven years after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a
Computer Science degree. He has performed product security assessments of
products ranging from the Linux operating system to enterprise-level web
applications. He currently works as a product security consultant at Hewlett
Packard in Austin, TX.

SPEAKER: James &quot;Iv0ryW0lf&quot; Boyd, Lvl 23 Cyber Shaman @ Lumenate

PRESO TITLE: BlackMailed

PRESO SUMMARY: During some boring research looking through emails, I
stumbled upon unnecessary uses that are fun! I plan to cover a brief history
of email, brief discussion of DarkMail, and then move into BlackMailed. The
preso will cover statics based on a collection of emails that are considered
good, bad, and unknown and are stored in a database for intelligence
gathering. I will cover email header details &amp; their uses, some trend
analysis, and interesting header manipulation/hacking. BlackMailed is a
series of python scripts that are only prototypes with mongoDB in the
backend. Once I get it to a decent and stable state, I will add it to my GIT
repo.
