Hi all,


Austin OWASP is happy to announce that we have a special training available on July 12th and 13th. Ben Ten (@Ben0xA) will be teaching "Advanced Powershell for Red and Blue Teams."


This training is $25 and includes lunch on both days. It runs from around 9 am to 5 pm each day. It is being held at National Instruments (thank you NI!) in the same room as our chapter meeting.


Go here to sign up: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-austin-summer-training-days-advanced-powershell-for-offense-and-defense-by-ben0xa-tickets-47244384225


There is limited seating and it will fill up, so be sure to hurry if you are interested in going. No refunds, so be sure you are available before you buy your ticket.


Thanks,


Matt Pardo
