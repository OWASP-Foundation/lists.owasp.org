<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers,

Hopefully this e-mail finds you all outside somewhere enjoying this 
beautiful day here in Austin, TX.  It's days like today that remind me why 
I came down here from the frozen tundra that is Minnesota almost 13 years 
ago now. 

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, Thursday, March 18, 5-7 PM
I wanted to remind everyone of the upcoming Austin Security Professionals 
Happy Hour sponsored by the Denim Group on Thursday, March 18 from 5 - 7 
PM.  As usual, the event will be at Sherlock's at 183 and Burnet and we 
have the regular party room reserved.  That said, if it turns out to be as 
nice a day as it is today, perhaps our group will creep out onto the patio 
instead.  As usual, you'll find no better opportunity to get out and 
network with your fellow security practitioners in a super fun and 
friendly environment.  And this time we can sincerely thank the Denim 
Group for providing us all with tasty beverages and nourishment at this 
awesome event.  Don't worry about SXSW either, Sherlocks is not a SXSW 
venue and they'll have plenty of parking and it's business as usual for 
them.  See you there!

OWASP Meeting, Enterprise Application Security Practices, Tuesday, March 
30, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
Also, please make sure to mark your calendar for the March OWASP meeting 
on it's regular day and time on Tuesday, March 30 from 11:30 AM to 1:00 
PM.  This months presentation on Enterprise Application Security 
Practices: Real-world Tips and Techniques by Addison, Chad, and Mike from 
Dell is going to be awesome. 

And if you haven't signed up yet, be sure you get on 
<A HREF="http://austinowasp.ning.com">http://austinowasp.ning.com</A> to RSVP for events, participate in 
discussions, and much more.  Take care!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CCNA, GWAS)
