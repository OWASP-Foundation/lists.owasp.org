<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers!

I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who came out to last week's 
happy hour.  I hope that you had as much fun networking with everyone as I 
did.  I overheard some VERY interesting conversations.  Also, a huge thank 
you to the Denim Group for sponsoring the event.  The only thing better 
than networking with security professionals at a happy hour is drinking 
and eating for free while you are doing it! 

If you haven't done so yet, be sure to get signed up for our Ning group 
located at:

<A HREF="http://austinowasp.ning.com/">http://austinowasp.ning.com/</A>

Here's a list of some of our upcoming events for Austin OWASP:

March 30, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM: Enterprise Application Security 
Practices: Real-world Tips and Techniques (OWASP Meeting)
How can you re-energize your company&#8217;s or institution&#8217;s commitment to 
secure development practices as part of the SDLC, while keeping costs in 
check? Dell's Security Consulting team created an application security 
practice with the help of several internal teams in legal, enterprise 
architecture, vendor management, privacy, compliance, and network 
engineering. Team members Addison Lawrence, Chad Barker, and Mike Craigue 
will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities they have faced over 
the last three years, ramping from 27 project engagements in 2007, to 726 
project engagements in 2009. In this session, we will discuss the creation 
of policies/standards, deploying a Security Development Lifecycle as an 
overlay to the SDLC, overcoming concerns of developers and business 
partners, and addressing global standardization issues. Also included: 
awareness/education/training, application security user groups, security 
consulting staff development, risk assessments, security reviews, threat 
modeling, source code scans, deployment scans, penetration testing, 
exception management, and executive escalations. Tell us what we might do 
to improve our program and increase our effectiveness; discuss how you 
could adapt parts of this approach to your own program. 

April 22, 2010, 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Austin Security Professionals Happy 
Hour
If you haven't been to one of these yet, you should definitely go.  As 
usual it will be at Sherlock's (9012 Research Blvd) and is the best 
opportunity you'll find to network with your fellow security 
professionals.  Thanks in advance to Fortify for sponsoring the April 
event for us!

April 27, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM: Automated vs Manual Security: You 
can't filter the stupid (OWASP Meeting)
Everyone wants to stretch their security budget, and automated application 
security tools are an appealing choice for doing so. However, manual 
security testing isn&#8217;t going anywhere until the HAL application scanner 
comes online. This presentation will use often humorous, real-world 
examples to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of automated 
solutions and manual techniques. 

Automated tools have some strengths, namely low incremental cost, 
detecting simple vulnerabilities, and performing highly repetitive tasks. 
However, automated solutions are far from perfect. There are entire 
classes of vulnerabilities that are theoretically impossible for automated 
software to detect. Examples include complex information leakage, race 
conditions, logic flaws, design flaws, and multistage process attacks. 
Beyond that, there are many vulnerabilities that are too complicated or 
obscure to practically detect with an automated tool. 

Hopefully we'll see you soon!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
President
Austin OWASP
