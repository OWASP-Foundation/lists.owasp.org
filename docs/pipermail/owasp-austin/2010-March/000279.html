When:March 30, 2010, 11:30am - 1:00pm


Topic: Enterprise Application Security Practices: Real-world Tips and
Techniques

How can you re-energize your company&#8217;s or institution&#8217;s commitment to
secure development practices as part of the SDLC, while keeping costs in
check? Dell's Security Consulting team created an application security
practice with the help of several internal teams in legal, enterprise
architecture, vendor management, privacy, compliance, and network
engineering. Team members Addison Lawrence, Chad Barker, and Mike Craigue
will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities they have faced over
the last three years, ramping from 27 project engagements in 2007, to 726
project engagements in 2009. In this session, we will discuss the creation
of policies/standards, deploying a Security Development Lifecycle as an
overlay to the SDLC, overcoming concerns of developers and business
partners, and addressing global standardization issues. Also included:
awareness/education/training, application security user groups, security
consulting staff development, risk assessments, security reviews, threat
modeling, source code scans, deployment scans, penetration testing,
exception management, and executive escalations. Tell us what we might do
to improve our program and increase our effectiveness; discuss how you
could adapt parts of this approach to your own program.
