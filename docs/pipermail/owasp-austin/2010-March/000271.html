  Techniques                                                                
                                                                            
  How can you re-energize your company&#8217;s or institution&#8217;s commitment to     
  secure development practices as part of the SDLC, while keeping costs in  
  check? Dell's Security Consulting team created an application security    
  practice with the help of several internal teams in legal, enterprise     
  architecture, vendor management, privacy, compliance, and network         
  engineering. Team members Addison Lawrence, Chad Barker, and Mike Craigue 
  will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities they have faced     
  over the last three years, ramping from 27 project engagements in 2007,   
  to 726 project engagements in 2009. In this session, we will discuss the  
  creation of policies/standards, deploying a Security Development          
  Lifecycle as an overlay to the SDLC, overcoming concerns of developers    
  and business partners, and addressing global standardization issues. Also 
  included: awareness/education/training, application security user groups, 
  security consulting staff development, risk assessments, security         
  reviews, threat modeling, source code scans, deployment scans,            
  penetration testing, exception management, and executive escalations.     
  Tell us what we might do to improve our program and increase our          
  effectiveness; discuss how you could adapt parts of this approach to your 
  own program.
