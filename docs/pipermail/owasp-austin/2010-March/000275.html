&gt;<i> On the topic of crypto, cypherpunks, and privacy, Steven Levy put out

</I>&gt;<i> have a copy but haven't had a chance to read it yet.
</I>
If you're interested in crypto then get Koblitz's &quot;A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography&quot; and Schnier's &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot;. They're both pretty old now, but the basic math hasn't changed a lot. I also very much like Stoll's &quot;The Cuckoo's Egg&quot; as I was hacking around with the Black Monks from Amsterdam on Amigas and there was a constant buzz about the CCC goings on. I got to chat with Pengo on a bridge for about a minute once. I still regularly use my 2nd edition red covered &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; for a shibboleth for meetings (like Hacking Society).

&gt;<i> Matt Blaze also did an interesting Silver Bullet podcast that covered
</I>&gt;<i> the issue.  What I remember of what he said is that the movement
</I>&gt;<i> started when it became feasible to start doing crypto in software at
</I>&gt;<i> no marginal cost.  Until that time, most crypto was done in
</I>&gt;<i> special-purpose hardware units that were expensive and under tighter
</I>&gt;<i> control.
</I>
Matt and I don't see eye to eye on many things. Crypto has been around for quite a while, Khan's book &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; and the publishing of the knapsack algorithms in the 70's is really what kicked off a wave of civilian interest. At this same time it was clear through the growth of the Arpanet that there was going to be a use for this technology. We used to have a hands-on science museum in Austin called Discovery Hall. I was one of the founders along with some others including Dr. Jack Turner ( <A HREF="http://order.ph.utexas.edu/">http://order.ph.utexas.edu/</A> ) and took care of their BBS and computer SIG among other things. We did a project one summer doing stego on a C64 using the LSB and some XOR padding to whiten the bit sequence (86 I think). What Matt's talking about is probably true for a lot of military and high end commercial apps, but most of it was more algorithmic and done on the Nova or 360 that the business had.

I still have the floppy for the PGP 1.0 that I downloaded to my Amiga from Adelante BBS when Zimmerman put it up that first night. Bass-o-matic :)

&gt;<i> Although it seems like we're out of the woods on that particular
</I>&gt;<i> issue, DMCA and other laws are still restricting certain kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> software.  I recall a judge issing a ruling that software wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> speech, since it had a functional purpose - you can execute code.
</I>
Somebody should teach him about NLP then.

&gt;<i> Bloodaxe/Goggans told me that one shouldn't take &quot;The Hacker
</I>&gt;<i> Crackdown&quot; as gospel.  In particular, he said that he was not woken
</I>&gt;<i> with a gun to his head, as reported.  And the way he knew about the
</I>&gt;<i> impending Secret Service raid is that after requesting his student
</I>&gt;<i> records, UT/Austin was obligated by state law to inform him.
</I>
That's funny. I haven't talked to Chris since the last HoHoCon. You should ask him about the 4th of July Bar-b-q at Rick Wallingford's old place over off Burnet (I think it was Houston street ???). There were these two guys down the street sitting in a car, somebody noticed the badge on his belt when he got out to stretch. We used to play poker over there on Wed. nights all the time for several years. I wonder if Chris still has the Ms. Pac Man machine, I still have the Stargate arcade machine. We had bought them from Rick and when they busted Chris they were trying to charge him on stolen property over it at one point.

I'ts worth mentioning that to be accurate the bust of LoD/MoD and Sundevil were two separate operations. I think had LoD and MoD not been at war the bust wouldn't have been as probable. I guess that's what happens when you call somebody &quot;nigger&quot; on a bridge :) I can't remember if Lex Luthor said it or was called it to be honest.
