&gt;<i> They busted Steve's company because Loyd Blankenship (The Mentor)
</I>  was working there as the editor on the Cyberpunks books and the SS
  felt it was a handbook to hack. They also got Chris (Erik
  Bloodaxe). Part of the confusion was they thought that the SJG BBS
  was part of Loyd's Phoenix Project BBS (I was #19 Ravage).

A friend of mine gave me his copy of that book (GURPS Cypherpunks)
recently.  The fact that the SS shut that down is kind of funny...  it
has some ideas but is in no way a manual, lacks any technical details.
There were much more detailed books out at the time, like &quot;Out of the
Inner Circle&quot;.  Not that that has anything to do with anything, since
it's clearly a First Amendment issue.

On the topic of crypto, cypherpunks, and privacy, Steven Levy put out
a book called &quot;Crypto&quot; that is supposed to deal with the topic.  I
have a copy but haven't had a chance to read it yet.

Matt Blaze also did an interesting Silver Bullet podcast that covered
the issue.  What I remember of what he said is that the movement
started when it became feasible to start doing crypto in software at
no marginal cost.  Until that time, most crypto was done in
special-purpose hardware units that were expensive and under tighter
control.

Although it seems like we're out of the woods on that particular
issue, DMCA and other laws are still restricting certain kinds of
software.  I recall a judge issing a ruling that software wasn't
speech, since it had a functional purpose - you can execute code.
However, I find this argument specious; I've always felt that the act
of programming is very much like speech, in that you're explaining how
to do something; the only difference is that you're being very precise
in doing so.

Bloodaxe/Goggans told me that one shouldn't take &quot;The Hacker
Crackdown&quot; as gospel.  In particular, he said that he was not woken
with a gun to his head, as reported.  And the way he knew about the
impending Secret Service raid is that after requesting his student
records, UT/Austin was obligated by state law to inform him.
