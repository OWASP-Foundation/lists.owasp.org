<PRE>Hello everyone!

I hope you all are having a wonderful August!  Here are the details for our
upcoming chapter meeting later this month.

*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for August*

When: Tuesday, August 29th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Title: *Privacy-Preserving Authentication, Another Reason to Care about
Zero-Knowlege Proofs*


You can ignore the Blockchain hype for identity solutions, it is superb
marketing; but suboptimal technology. You can also ignore biometrics for a
spell. Instead, the real breakthroughs, especially in authentication, will
be based on elegant math and crypto, e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).
These have the added benefit of being privacy-preserving, and amenable to
user control of identity attributes. ZKP has been identified as a category
for many other solutions in the future, not just identity. Conceived at MIT
in 1985 by Shafi Goldwasser, ZKP is still young. You will see it in many
other contexts as appreciation and recognition evolves.


*Speaker: *Clare Nelson, CISSP, CIPP/E


Clare's focus combines security, privacy, and identity. Her middle name is
MFA, and she loves all things identity. She forges identity solution
roadmaps and tracks emerging technologies, especially in light of EU
regulations including GDPR and PSD2.


Clare&#8217;s early technical background includes software development of
encrypted TCP/IP variants for NSA. She has held leadership positions in
product management, marketing, and technology for companies including EMC2,
Dell, Novell, and TeaLeaf Technology (IBM).


Clare is a co-founder of the mentoring organization, C1ph3r_Qu33ns. She
headed ClearMark Consulting for 14 years, and she is currently Director,
Office of the CTO at AllClear ID. She has a B.S. in Mathematics from Tufts
University, and is a lifelong fitness enthusiast.

*Food: *Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have
enough for all!

Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!
