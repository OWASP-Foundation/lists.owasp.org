<PRE>Hello everyone!

As a reminder, the *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *for August is
coming up next week, Thursday, August 10th.  If you have not already done
so, please RSVP so we can get a good indication of how many will be
attending.  Here are the details:

*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for August*

*When:* Thursday, August 10th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where:* Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd). We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

*Sponsor:* Rapid7

*Rapid7 is engineering better security with simple, innovative solutions
for IT security's most critical challenges. Our security data and analytics
solutions collect, contextualize, correlate, and analyze the security data
you need to dramatically reduce threat exposure and detect compromise in
real-time. They speed investigations so you can halt threats and clean up
systems fast. Plus, our analytics give you the specific information you
need to systematically improve security processes within your organization.
Unlike traditional vulnerability assessment or incident management,
Rapid7's comprehensive data collection, attacker intelligence and
user-behavior analytics give you immediate insight into the security state
of your assets and users from the endpoint to the cloud. We offer unmatched
capabilities to spot intruders leveraging today's #1 attack vector,
compromised credentials. Our ability to help goes beyond our innovative
technology. Rapid7 security experts can help you advance your security
program, whether you need emergency breach response or to transform your
security processes and better align investments to your organization's risk
and needs. Rapid7 is trusted by more than 4,150 organizations across 90
countries, including 34% of the Fortune 1000. Our products are top rated by
Gartner&#174;, Forrester&#174; and SC Magazine. For more information about Rapid7,

Also, planning for *LASCON 2017* continues. We will be announcing our
speakers in the next week, and publishing the schedule shortly after.  See
below for details as well as opportunities for discounted conference
tickets.

*LASCON 2017*

*When:* Thursday &amp; Friday, October 26-27, 2017

*Where:* Norris Conference Center, 2525 W. Anderson Lane, Suite 365,
Austin, Texas 78757

*What: *The Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) is an OWASP
conference held annually in Austin, TX. It is a gathering of 400+ web app
developers, security engineers, mobile developers and information security
professionals. LASCON is held in Texas where more Fortune 500 companies
call home than any other state, and is held in Austin which is a hub for
startups in the state of Texas. At LASCON, leaders at these companies along
with security architects and developers gather to share cutting-edge ideas,
initiatives, and technology advancements.
