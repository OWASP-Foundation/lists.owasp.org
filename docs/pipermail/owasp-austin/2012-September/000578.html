Subject: ATTN: David -- Job Opportunities at HP

Hi David,

I have 7 new opportunities on my team here in HP. None of these positions are backfills. My team is a rapidly growing function that plays a strategic role for securing some of HP&#8217;s most important assets. Two of the openings are college hire level (i.e. within one year of graduation, one of the roles is for an experienced AppSec Engineer (i.e. 2+ years of experience or a CS Masters), 3 of the roles are senior AppSec Engineering positions and the other one is a AppSec Architect which is a Master level role (20+ years in a developer/security role). Below is a general JD for open roles:

This position will provide technical security leadership on programs and projects to groups throughout HP as a member and representative of the HP Global Cyber Security organization.  A qualified candidate will be responsible for security consulting in all phases of the software development lifecycle to worldwide teams of developers within HP.  This candidate will not only provide consulting services, but must also have the ability to write quality secure code in Java and/or .Net which can be leveraged either directly or via way of exposed web services to IT and business groups throughout HP.

While a strong security background is desired, a strong candidate with extensive history of writing code is more than acceptable if accompanied by a strong desire to build a security skill-set.  Only candidates who can demonstrate real-world experience writing in Java and/or .NET will be considered.  We are looking for individuals who can write core libraries in addition to leveraging them within custom applications.  It is expected that this individual will review code on a regular basis.
