*September OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting (Sponsored by SolarWinds)

*This is our last Chapter meeting of the year!


*When*: Tomorrow, September 25th, 11:30am-1:00pm

*Topic:* Vulnerability Spidey Sense
*
**Speakers: *Daniel Crowely and Chris Vinecombe

*Daniel Crowley *- Daniel (aka &quot;unicornFurnace&quot;) is an Application
Security Consultant for Trustwave's SpiderLabs team. He has been working
in the information security industry for over 7 years and has been
focused on penetration testing, specifically on Web applications. Daniel
denies all allegations regarding unicorn smuggling and questions your
character for evensuggesting it. Daniel has developed configurable
testbeds such as SQLol and XMLmao for training and research regarding
specific vulnerabilities. Daniel enjoys climbing large rocks. Daniel is
a frequent speaker at conferences including DEFCON, Shmoocon, and
SOURCE. Daniel does his own charcuterie.

*Chris Vinecombe* - Chris Vinecombe is an Application Security Analyst
for Trustwave's SpiderLabs team.  He has been working in the information
security industry for 2 years.  He currently focuses on penetration
testing, specifically web application security.  He is eager to learn
ALL the things.

*Abstract:* A dedicated attacker does not have time limitations when
attempting to find vulnerabilities in a target. As a penetration tester,
you are bound by certain restrictions, including scope, attack methods,
and time/date restrictions. Because of these restrictions, it's helpful
to prioritize certain targets over others to increase your chances of
breaking in. This talk will cover scenarios which raise red flags for
us, why, and how to develop your own sense of intuition.

*RSVP:* <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4319523812">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4319523812</A>
