<PRE>Hello,

I was at the chapter meeting Tuesday and my name was called to win one of the AMEX gift cards from Solarwinds.  This was a great gift until I tried to use it only to find out it had expired July 2010.  I hope this was an honest mistake and I can get another gift card from David.  Please advise??

*September OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting (Sponsored by SolarWinds)

*This is our last Chapter meeting of the year!


*When*: Tomorrow, September 25th, 11:30am-1:00pm

*Topic:* Vulnerability Spidey Sense
*
**Speakers: *Daniel Crowely and Chris Vinecombe

*Daniel Crowley *- Daniel (aka &quot;unicornFurnace&quot;) is an Application Security Consultant for Trustwave's SpiderLabs team. He has been working in the information security industry for over 7 years and has been focused on penetration testing, specifically on Web applications. Daniel denies all allegations regarding unicorn smuggling and questions your character for evensuggesting it. Daniel has developed configurable testbeds such as SQLol and XMLmao for training and research regarding specific vulnerabilities. Daniel enjoys climbing large rocks. Daniel is a frequent speaker at conferences including DEFCON, Shmoocon, and SOURCE. Daniel does his own charcuterie.

*Chris Vinecombe* - Chris Vinecombe is an Application Security Analyst for Trustwave's SpiderLabs team.  He has been working in the information security industry for 2 years.  He currently focuses on penetration testing, specifically web application security.  He is eager to learn ALL the things.

*Abstract:* A dedicated attacker does not have time limitations when attempting to find vulnerabilities in a target. As a penetration tester, you are bound by certain restrictions, including scope, attack methods, and time/date restrictions. Because of these restrictions, it's helpful to prioritize certain targets over others to increase your chances of breaking in. This talk will cover scenarios which raise red flags for us, why, and how to develop your own sense of intuition.

*RSVP:* <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4319523812">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4319523812</A>

*Cost:* Free, thanks to our Sponsor this month. Please RSVP so we will know how many to expect.
