I think it would cool if the first (or one of the first)
sustained/systematic (meaning at least 45 minutes worth of slides)
treatment on the topic would be presented at an Austin OWASP meeting!

I started tracking issue about 6 weeks ago on
http://www.threatmind.net/secwiki/RailsVulns and of course with last
weeks posts to bugtraq/webappsec and the generally poor response (but
not suprising having seen similar responses from commercial product
vendors when they get "hit" the frist time) from the rails team there
is likely to be more attention from independent researchers.

Some quick ideas off the top of my head:

- analysis of the implementation flaws (requires doing some "syn diffs")
- look at architectural/design for attack surface issues, how they do
sessions, etc.

If you haven't heard about this:

The Denim folks down in SA have been blogging on this

as the always interesting Matasano crew talks about it here
http://www.matasano.com/log/416/alert-vulnerability-in-web-20-upgrade-immediately-to-web-201/

Anyone game? I'm hoping to team with someone that has better knowledge
of all that "MVC stuff"

It would be cool if we presented this at the September meeting.

Howdy,

Just joined OWASP Austin today. 

My name is Rick I work for KoreLogic.com and have been doing web
application assessments for about 7 years now. I average about 15-20 Web
app assessments a year. (in addition to pentests, vulnerability
assessments, etc). 

I work at home in my central Austin house. I pretty much know no one
else in the security or OWASP-like world in Austin since I sit in my
dark-hole all day.

KoreLogic is about to become a large sponsor of OWASP, so I figured I'd
better join the local chapter now that it exists.

Attention OWASP Community,

OWASP is moving all of our mailing lists off of SourceForge and onto our
own infrastructure. We?re making this move to allow for better control
over the mail infrastructure and to address some service problems we?ve
been experiencing. Your account will be moved automatically, and you
don?t need to take any action. However, you may want to set your spam
filter to allow messages from the new lists. All OWASP email lists will
come from @lists.owasp.org. All OWASP lists can be found at
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo

Thank you for your continued support of OWASP.
