<PRE>*When:* July 29th, 2008, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Who:* Whurley and Mando

William Hurley is the Chief Architect of Open Source Strategy at BMC
Software, Inc. Also known as &quot;whurley&quot;, he is responsible for creating BMC's
open source agenda and overseeing the company's participation in various
free and open source software communities to advance the adoption and
integration of BSM solutions. A technology visionary and holder of 11
important patents, whurley brings 16 years of experience in developing
groundbreaking technology. He is the Chairman of the Open Management
Consortium, a non-profit organization advancing the adoption, development,
and integration of open source systems management. Named an IBM Master
Inventor, whurley has received numerous awards including an IBM Pervasive
Computing Award and Apple Computer Design Award.

Mando Escamilla is the Chief Software Architect at Symbiot, Inc.  He is
responsible for the technical vision and architecture for the Symbiot
product line as well as the technical direction for the openSIMS project.
He stands (mostly firmly) on the shoulders of giants at Symbiot and he hopes
to not embarrass himself.

*Topic:* The rebirth of openSIMS
<A HREF="http://opensims.sourceforge.netCorrelation,">http://opensims.sourceforge.netCorrelation,</A> visualization, and
remediation with a network effect

OpenSIMS has a sordid history. The project was originally a way for tying
together the open source tools used for security management into a common
infrastructure. Then the team added a real-time RIA for a new kind of
analysis and visualization of enterprise network security (winning them an
Apple Design Award in 2004). Then out of nowhere the project went dark. Now,
Mando Escamilla (Symbiot/openSIMS) and whurley give you a look at the future
of openSIMS as a services layer and explain why community centric security
is valuable to your enterprise.

*Where:* Whole Foods, 550 Bowie Street, Austin, TX 78703.  Come to the Whole
Foods plaza level and sign in with receptionist. To get to the plaza take
the stairs from the main entrance.  The stairs are located on the West Side
of the building, just north of the main entrance.  There is no access to the
Plaza level from inside the store.

See [<A HREF="http://tinylink.com/?chLCAmvxKA">http://tinylink.com/?chLCAmvxKA</A> directions to Whole Foods].
