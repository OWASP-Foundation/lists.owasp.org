Then out of nowhere the project went dark. Now, Mando Escamilla (Symbiot/openSIMS) and whurley give you a look at the future of openSIMS as a services layer and explain why community centric security is valuable to your enterprise.Where: Whole Foods, 550 Bowie Street, Austin, TX 78703.&amp;nbsp; Come to the Whole Foods plaza level and sign in with receptionist.
