<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

Sorry for the second reminder this week, but we've only had about 15
people RSVP for the happy Hour so I wanted to send out one last appeal.
If you're attending and have not RSVP'd yet, please do so at the link
below so that we can get a somewhat accurate count.

Thanks!

David H.


      Austin InfoSec Happy Hour, March 8th, Sponsored by FireEye.

*What:* Great conversation, and the beer and food are covered! This is a
popular monthly event with lots of folks from OWASP, ISSA, and others!
This is a wonderful networking opportunity!

*When:* March 8th, from 5pm-7pm

*Where*: Sherlocks Pub and Grill, Research @ Burnet.

*How?* Our Sponsor: *FireEye* is the leading provider of next-generation
threat protection focused on combating advanced malware, zero-day and
targeted APT attacks. FireEye's solutions supplement security defenses
such as traditional and next-generation firewalls, IPS, antivirus and
Web gateways, which can't stop advanced malware. These technologies
leave significant security holes in the majority of corporate networks.
FireEye's Malware Protection Systems feature both inbound and outbound
protection and a signature-less analysis engine that utilizes the most
sophisticated virtual execution engine in the world to stop advanced
threats that attack over Web and email. Our customers include
enterprises and mid-sized companies across every industry as well as
Federal agencies. Based in Milpitas, California, FireEye is backed by
premier financial partners.

Cost: None to you!
