<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

Add the following upcoming events to your calendars!


    May OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting -- Dustin Kirkland, Gazzang.com

*When:* Tuesday, May 28th, from 11:30am-1:30pm

/Where:'/ National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Topic: *Encrypt Everything Everywhere (but *especially* in the Cloud)

*Abstract:*

72% of the 21 million U.S. health care records that have been
compromised since 2009 should have been trivially protected using
comprehensive encryption of the data before being written to disk
(see: <A HREF="http://1.usa.gov/a2UGEG">http://1.usa.gov/a2UGEG</A>). A busy cloud compute node from OpenStack
or Amazon EC2 might spin up thousands of instances per day. Ephemeral,
block, and object storage - each and every one of these should always be
encrypted before being written to the underlying physical media. The
good news is multiple excellent file and disk encryption solutions exist
in Linux, such as eCryptfs and dm-crypt,making encrypting everything
simple and cost-effective.This session is designed for security
professionals, IT decision makers and solution architects. We'll discuss
encryption and key management best practices and examine use cases for
companies that store sensitive and regulated data in the cloud.

*Speaker Bio:* Dustin Kirkland is the CTO at Gazzang, delivering data
security and encryption for cloud computing and big data using eCryptfs,
dmcrypt, and an innovative key management system called zTrustee. Dustin
is also an active Core Developer of the Ubuntu Linux distribution,
maintainer of 20+ open source projects, and the creator of Byobu,
zEscrow, DivItUp.com, and LinuxSearch.org. A Fightin' Texas Aggie Class
of 2001 graduate, Dustin lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife Kim,
daughter, and his two Australian Shepherds, Aggie and Tiger.

*Cost:* Free!

*Lunch:* Provided by LASCON! Please RSVP so we can order enough food.
