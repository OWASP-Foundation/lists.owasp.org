<PRE>Hello Everyone!


First, let me introduce myself to those of you who may not know me.  My
name is Tiana Chandler and I will be the OWASP Austin Chapter Leader
starting in 2016, taking over for Kyle Smith.  Kyle has done a tremendous
job as the Chapter Leader these past few years.  Thank you Kyle, for your
previous leadership and ongoing support and guidance for our chapter&#8217;s
success.


As for those of you who look forward to the monthly Austin Security
Professionals Happy Hour, the first one of the new year will be on
Thursday, January 14, 2016.  We will be at Sherlocks Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill
at Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd.


Our sponsor will be Bugcrowd, who is looking forward to meeting everyone.
This will be a great event to talk with fellow information security
professionals.

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Bugcrowd


*When:*  Thursday, January 14th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm


*Where: *Sherlock&#8217;s Baker St. Pub &amp; Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX
78758 (corner of Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd).  We meet in the large room to the
right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the room.


*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.


*Sponsor:* Bugcrowd

harnesses the power of more than 19,000 security researchers to surface
critical software vulnerabilities. Bugcrowd provides a range of
vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs that allow organizations
