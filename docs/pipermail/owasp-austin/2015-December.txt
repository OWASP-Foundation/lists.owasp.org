Hello Everyone!


First, let me introduce myself to those of you who may not know me.  My
name is Tiana Chandler and I will be the OWASP Austin Chapter Leader
starting in 2016, taking over for Kyle Smith.  Kyle has done a tremendous
job as the Chapter Leader these past few years.  Thank you Kyle, for your
previous leadership and ongoing support and guidance for our chapter?s
success.


As for those of you who look forward to the monthly Austin Security
Professionals Happy Hour, the first one of the new year will be on
Thursday, January 14, 2016.  We will be at Sherlocks Baker St. Pub & Grill
at Hwy 183 and Burnet Rd.


Our sponsor will be Bugcrowd, who is looking forward to meeting everyone.
This will be a great event to talk with fellow information security
professionals.

*Where: *Sherlock?s Baker St. Pub & Grill, 9012 Research Blvd, Austin, TX

*What: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event

local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.
