> Security is becoming more and more a part of our mainstream in software development. It's getting hard to develop without a good, solid nod towards security, but often times, security closes holes that we need in testing to verify our software quality and produce better product. 
> 
> What's more, how do we test the security itself? Please join us at the Security SIG to discuss the issues of how security lines up with testing.

    OWASP Austin April Chapter Meeting - CSP to the Rescue - Neil
    Matatall, Twitter

*Please RSVP at the link below so we can plan for food. By doing this,
you will also be signed up for our monthly drawings!*

*When:* Tuesday, April 30th, from 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Where:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Topic:*CSP to the Rescue

Abstract: CSP to the rescue XSS is still very much an unsolved problem.
Browser quirks, contextual mismatches, and programmer error can be
attributed to 100% of stored/reflected XSS. It is a problem we have been
battling for almost 20 years. Even with input validation and output
encoding, how can we be certain that we will never execute unintended
Javascript? CSP. Implementing CSP to provably disable cross-site
scripting isn't trivial, but I propose that anyone can do it. During
this presentation we'll look at how the spec accomplishes its goal,
recommendations for implementing its application, lessons learned, and
tools that support the application of CSP.


*Speaker:* Neil Matatall, Twitter

Neil is a security engineer for Twitter. He focuses on integrating
security technologies into the software development stack at all levels.
He would prefer to grow a powerful neckbeard and code in the dark, but
sometimes life gets in the way. He has been involved with OWASP since
2008 and had lead the OWASP OC chapter and has contributed to many open
source projects.

*Food:* Taco Deli, Sponsored by the Lonestar Application Security
Conference(LASCON) (http://www.lascon.org)

PLEASE RSVP so we can plan the meal and so that you'll be entered into
the prize drawing!

	Meeting?
Message-ID: <CAFwvDewzOd3CTO0_vT1OeBv-DoG9+k+aH1en_abd-QpcOe7z+Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to help find a presenter for this months UT Student Chapter of
OWASP.  The meeting is on Monday, April 22nd at 7 PM.  Plan for roughly an
hour worth of content.  If it has to do with InfoSec, then it's probably
something they'd like to hear about.  Expect somewhere in the neighborhood
of 30 students eager to hear you talk, but be prepared to explain things as
a lot of this stuff is new to them.  Free pizza and soda.  Respond back
directly to Tony and Kevin (cc'd) if you are interested.  Thanks!
