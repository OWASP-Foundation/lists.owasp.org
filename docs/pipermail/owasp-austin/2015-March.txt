Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Austin Study Group cancelled tomorrow,
	March 5th
Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu9c7vPeViU9aj0=FJ6zOoDUu86dRQWO5w3Xn6X2ZW5+_g@mail.gmail.com>

If you are currently active in the OWASP Austin Study Group, please read
on.  Otherwise you can discard this message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


With the current winter weather warning, it is possible that the roads may
be hazardous to drive tomorrow. Many of the area school districts have
announced schools will be closed all day. My company has announced a late
start at 10:00 AM.  Best case is that the roads may be clear enough for
getting to NI by noon, but not sure if a late start may keep many from
attending the study group.


With that, we will *CANCEL* our study group tomorrow, *Thursday, March 5th.*



Note that next week, Thursday, March 12th, is BSides conference.  We will
not be meeting then.


So, the *next meeting will be Thursday, March 19th*, which will be a
continuation of Chapter 4.

I had also posted this to the OWASP Austin Study Group (Ning) site, so
hopefully you have received a notification message from that posting.  If
you did not, then you may want to ensure that you are signed up on the
site, joined the group (http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup),
and are "Following" the discussion thread for the book (
http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-the-browser-hacker-s-handbook).
If you have any questions about this, please let me know.

Thanks,

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Now hiring @ Dell
Message-ID: <CAMMsCZv33J4PurCYgSKFA_-3GBBcM-FxHhM9K49tsmB+w66CNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone,

Just thought I'd share that we're hiring for multiple mid and senior level
Security Consultants at Dell if anyone is interested.  I'm posting the link
to one of the positions below, but you can go to Dell's Jobs website (
http://jobs.dell.com) and search for either "security analysis" or
"security consultant" for US jobs to find the one below as well as the
others.  Also, there are other security positions open at Dell across the
globe, if one fancies or knows someone looking outside of the US.

We'll also be hiring more throughout this year, so check back later if you
decide you're interested then rather than now.  Feel free to ping me (
mike.cherry at owasp.org) if you would like more insight or have any questions.
