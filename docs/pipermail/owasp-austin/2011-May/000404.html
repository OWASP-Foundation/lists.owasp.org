Subject: [Owasp-austin] LASCON 2011 Is Coming

 

Hey Austin OWASPers! 

I mentioned this at our last meeting, but since not everybody was there,
I wanted to send out a note about it as well.  We have begun planning
for LASCON 2011 .  This means that we are actively looking for
volunteers, soliciting sponsors, accepting speakers, and taking
registrations for the 2011 Lonestar Application Security Conference
happening at the Norris Conference Center on October 28, 2011.  I'll
keep this brief, but if you are interested in volunteering or sponsoring
LASCON, send us an e-mail at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">lascon at owasp.org</A> and we will get you the
necessary information.  If you are interested in speaking at LASCON,
please submit to our CFP at
<A HREF="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011</A>&gt; .  This year's
conference will feature 4-5 tracks focusing on Auditing, Architecture,
Development, Executive Management, Solutions, and OWASP Tools.  The CFP
will be open until July 15, 2011. 

Most importantly, if you are interested in attending LASCON 2011,
registration using our brand new RegOnline system is now online.  Simply
go to <A HREF="http://www.lascon.org">http://www.lascon.org</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lascon.org/">http://www.lascon.org/</A>&gt;  and click on the
&quot;Register Now&quot; link.  Registration is only $75 for members and $125 for
non-members (includes $50 OWASP membership) through the end of July.
While we haven't made the speaker lineup public yet, we have already
committed presentations from some of the world's top security
professionals.  And make sure you stick around after the conference for
our LASCON Happy Hour sponsored by Trustwave.  Yes folks, the bar and
the mechanical bull will be back.  Just like last year, you will not be
disappointed.  No conference gives you more bang for your buck than
LASCON.  We'll see you there! 

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol and James Wickett 
LASCON 2011 Co-Chairs
