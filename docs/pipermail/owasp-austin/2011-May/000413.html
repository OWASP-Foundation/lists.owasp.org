<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

One comment that I've heard from you all time and time again is &quot;This 
Metasploit stuff looks really cool, but I don't know how to get started.&quot;  
If that sounds like you, then Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA have 
something special for you.  We have recruited Raphael Mudge, creator of 
the Armitage UI for Metasploit, to come to Austin and give a half-day 
training on &quot;Penetration Testing with Metasploit&quot;.  This hands-on training 
will teach you not only how to get started with Metasploit, but the 
methodology behind conducting a penetration test using the tool.
The training will take place on Friday, June 17, 2011 from 1:30 to 5:00 PM 
at the Microsoft Technology Center.  Registration for this event is FREE 
courtesy of OWASP, ISSA, Microsoft, and Raphael, but space is extremely 
limited.  Once the registration has been filled, we will have a limited 
waiting list for potential entry the day of the event.  If you are 
planning on attending, you will want to sign up ASAP.  If you are unsure, 
please do not sign up and take away a spot from someone who will 
definitely attend.  To register yourself for the event, please go to:
<A HREF="http://metasploit.eventbrite.com">http://metasploit.eventbrite.com</A>

Because this training is hands-on, attendees are required to bring a 
laptop with either VMWare Player or VMWare Fusion pre-installed.  The 
laptop must also have a working DVD drive as we will be providing DVD's to 
all attendees containing the supporting software for the training.  In the 
event that registration is full, seating preference will be extended to 
those attendees who come prepared with the required tools. 
Immediately after the half-day seminar, we will head over to Sherlock's 
Baker St. Pub (183 and Burnet) for an Austin Security Professionals Happy 
Hour sponsored by Rapid7.  Note that this a different week and day of the 
week than our typical happy hour events in order to coincide with the 
preceding half-day seminar.  While attendance to the seminar is first-come 
first-served, the happy hour is open to everyone and a separate invitation 
will be created for it.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
Information Security Program Owner
