<PRE>Hey Austin OWASPers!

I mentioned this at our last meeting, but since not everybody was there, I 
wanted to send out a note about it as well.  We have begun planning for 
LASCON 2011 .  This means that we are actively looking for volunteers, 
soliciting sponsors, accepting speakers, and taking registrations for the 
2011 Lonestar Application Security Conference happening at the Norris 
Conference Center on October 28, 2011.  I'll keep this brief, but if you 
are interested in volunteering or sponsoring LASCON, send us an e-mail at 
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">lascon at owasp.org</A> and we will get you the necessary information.  If you 
are interested in speaking at LASCON, please submit to our CFP at 
<A HREF="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011.">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011.</A>  This year's 
conference will feature 4-5 tracks focusing on Auditing, Architecture, 
Development, Executive Management, Solutions, and OWASP Tools.  The CFP 
will be open until July 15, 2011.

Most importantly, if you are interested in attending LASCON 2011, 
registration using our brand new RegOnline system is now online.  Simply 
go to <A HREF="http://www.lascon.org">http://www.lascon.org</A> and click on the &quot;Register Now&quot; link. 
Registration is only $75 for members and $125 for non-members (includes 
$50 OWASP membership) through the end of July.  While we haven't made the 
speaker lineup public yet, we have already committed presentations from 
some of the world's top security professionals.  And make sure you stick 
around after the conference for our LASCON Happy Hour sponsored by 
Trustwave.  Yes folks, the bar and the mechanical bull will be back.  Just 
like last year, you will not be disappointed.  No conference gives you 
more bang for your buck than LASCON.  We'll see you there!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol and James Wickett
LASCON 2011 Co-Chairs
