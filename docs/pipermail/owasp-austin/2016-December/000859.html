OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, January 31st from 11:30 AM
to 1:00 PM


*Random Number Generation - Lava Lamps, Clouds and the IoT*


Random numbers are the basis of security for all cryptography, yet they are
often taken for granted. Learn why random numbers are so hard to generate
and validate, compare different technologies in use today across
virtualized environments, and discuss operational steps to take the risk
out of random numbers and help secure cryptosystems even into the era of
quantum computers.


*Speaker: *Richard Moulds


Richard Moulds has more than 15 years experience in the security industry
with a specific focus on cryptography. Richard has worked with customers in
the areas of card and mobile payments, PKI, storage encryption, hardware
security modules and enterprise key management. He has participated in
OWASP, PCI DSS, OASIS, CSA and Quantum Safe industry groups and is the
author of Key Management for Dummies.
