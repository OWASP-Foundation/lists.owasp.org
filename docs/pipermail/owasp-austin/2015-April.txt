SPEAKER: Derek Hinch, Security Engineer at iSEC Partners 

PRESO TITLE: Advanced Replay Attacks using bouncyDuck 

PRESO SUMMARY: When time on an unauthorized terminal counts, replay attacks
can be some of the most efficient methods for target acquisition. Devices
such as the teensy HID and USB Rubber Ducky can be quite useful, however,
the default firmware is lacking in features. bouncyDuck is a simple script
that manages programming of multiple firmware types for the USB Rubber
Ducky, along with additional tools that allow payload customization in the
field with little to no knowledge of the ducky scripting language (does not
require a network connection either). This short talk will provide an
overview of each one of the types of firmware contained in bouncyDuck, the
best use case scenarios, and some of the features of the bouncyDuck tool
along with demonstrations of each. 

SPEAKER BIO: Derek has been involved in offensive security research for more
than 20 years. He is a former USAF Electronic Warfare R&D specialist (SEI
084/AFSC 2A071D), SIPRNET Domain Admin, and is currently senior staff at
DEFCON - where he runs the DEFCON Groups initiative, as well as serving as a
veteran DEFCON Security Goon. In his spare time he meddles in persistent
threat development, cryptography, and forensics. Derek has been a court
certified expert witness in Computers, Computer Security, and Digital
Forensics for computers and phones for more than 5 years.

SPEAKER: Jeremy Powell

PRESO TITLE: Software Defined Radio Primer

PRESO SUMMARY: SDR is a powerful technology that has recently become cheap
enough to for individuals to hack on. However, there's a steep learning
curve since it's fairly new and intersects many different disciplines. This
presentation will give you an overview of what SDR is, what technology is
available, and the vocabulary needed to start learning for yourself.

SPEAKER BIO: Jeremy has worked in the field of information security for
seven years after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a
Computer Science degree. He has performed product security assessments of
products ranging from the Linux operating system to enterprise-level web
applications. He currently works as a product security consultant at Hewlett
Packard in Austin, TX.

SPEAKER: James "Iv0ryW0lf" Boyd, Lvl 23 Cyber Shaman @ Lumenate

PRESO TITLE: BlackMailed

PRESO SUMMARY: During some boring research looking through emails, I
stumbled upon unnecessary uses that are fun! I plan to cover a brief history
of email, brief discussion of DarkMail, and then move into BlackMailed. The
preso will cover statics based on a collection of emails that are considered
good, bad, and unknown and are stored in a database for intelligence
gathering. I will cover email header details & their uses, some trend
analysis, and interesting header manipulation/hacking. BlackMailed is a
series of python scripts that are only prototypes with mongoDB in the
backend. Once I get it to a decent and stable state, I will add it to my GIT
repo.

Howdy OWASP Austinites!

Spring is here and events are in full swing in OWASP Austin and other local
groups.  OWASP Austin has already had great chapter meetings this year
(Thank you Matt, Earl, and all the CryptoParty speakers!) and our amazing
sponsors for the happy hours  (Thank you again Fishnet, Qualys, Alert
Logic, and iSEC Partners!).   It is strange to think that already 1/4 of
the year is gone.  Come out to OWASP Austin events!

OWASP Austin March Chapter Meeting
When: Tuesday, April 28th @ 11:45 - 1PM
Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac. Building C

Title: Using OpenSAMM for Benchmarking and Software Security Improvement

We all know that behind every breach story in the press is an organization
that probably should have done more to build secure software. Yet,
organizations struggle mightily to focus resources on building software
securely from the outset and, as a result, software security remains an
after the fact ?nice to do? and not a ?have to do? activity in many
organizations. How can organizations determine the right sets of activities
or appropriate resource allocation levels that it should undertake to
adequately address software risk? Organizations can make these
determinations by benchmarking via OWASP?s Open Software Assurance Maturity
Model (OpenSAMM) framework.

A coalition of leading application security industry vendors recently
contributed benchmarking data in order to enhance OpenSAMM and its
assessment framework. These efforts will enable organizations to step up
their software security game and identify hurdles by using OpenSAMM as a
powerful benchmarking tool. John will provide details on an ongoing
industry effort to improve OpenSAMM by providing more comparative data to
encourage broader use throughout industry.

Speaker: John Dickson

John Dickson is an internationally recognized security leader, entrepreneur
and Principal at Denim Group, Ltd. He has nearly 20 years hands-on
experience in intrusion detection, network security and application
security in the commercial, public and military sectors. As a Denim Group
Principal, he helps executives and Chief Security Officers (CSO?s) of
Fortune 500 companies and government organizations launch and expand their
critical application security initiatives. His leadership has been
instrumental in Denim Group being honored by Inc. Magazine as one of the
fastest growing companies in the industry for five years in a row.

Food: It will be a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough
for all!

Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

Message-ID: <CAMMsCZs+SPS8h6z+RU5GKXBnRyN=Lp02Waz07uKRRYS7Gu+phg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks -- just a quick question for everyone:  I'm most likely going to
do a CISSP bootcamp this summer, and I was just wondering if anyone had
recommendations for a specific bootcamp or instructor?  Anywhere in Texas
is fine -- Dallas, Austin, Houston, or San Antonio.

Thanks!

Mike,

I didn't actually attend one of his bootcamps, but Dean Bushmiller helped
out several years back when we ran the CISSP Study Group (what became the
OWASP Study Group).  He is very knowledgeable and I would HIGHLY recommend
him for your bootcamp.  You can check him out at
http://www.expandingsecurity.com/ and I believe he offers a free class once
a week to get your feet wet.
