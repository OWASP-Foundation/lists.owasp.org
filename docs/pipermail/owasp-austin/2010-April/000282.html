  Topic: Automated vs. Manual Security: You can't filter The Stupid         
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Everyone wants to stretch their security budget, and automated            
  application security tools are an appealing choice for doing so. However, 
  manual security testing isn&#8217;t going anywhere until the HAL application    
  scanner comes online. This presentation will use often humorous,          
  real-world examples to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses   
  of automated solutions and manual techniques.                             
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
  Automated tools have some strengths, namely low incremental cost,         
  detecting simple vulnerabilities, and performing highly repetitive tasks. 
  However, automated solutions are far from perfect. There are entire       
  classes of vulnerabilities that are theoretically impossible for          
  automated software to detect. Examples include complex information        
  leakage, race conditions, logic flaws, design flaws, and multistage       
  process attacks. Beyond that, there are many vulnerabilities that are too 
  complicated or obscure to practically detect with an automated tool.
