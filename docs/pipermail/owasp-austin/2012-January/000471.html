<PRE>Austin OWASPers,



I am pleased to announce the first OWASP Austin meeting of 2012!

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2658939961">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2658939961</A>&gt;

*Topic*: What's in Your Program? Application Security Maturity in 2012


Take a tour of the most successful software security initiatives in the
world through this presentation of research into application security
practices at over 40 well-known companies. From strategy &amp; metrics to
penetration testing, this study measured over 100 software security
activities across 12 areas, as they are practiced &quot;in the wild.&quot;
Comparative statistics as well as period-over-period progress will be
covered. You'll come away from this presentation armed with the facts to
plan, implement, and/or enhance your own software security program based on
real-world results.*

*Chapter Meeting RSVP*: <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2658939961">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2658939961</A>

If you fail to RSVP, there may not be enough food, so please do so ASAP.


Live Streaming Broadcast We will be streaming the meeting live using
GoToMeeting. If you are unable to attend, you may still hear the meeting
during the scheduled time at <A HREF="https://www3.gotomeeting.com/join/817893494">https://www3.gotomeeting.com/join/817893494</A>
The streaming is a bit on the experimental side, so no guarantees this will
all work perfectly. We're still working out the kinks, but we are excited
to offer this as a method to join us in our meetings. You will get to enjoy
the slide deck and the audio using the method, but will miss out on the
networking and the food, so come on out if you are able. If you do use the
GoToMeeting method, we'd love to hear feedback about your experience.

*******************************************************************
*
Also, Don't forget:

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour*, January 19th from 5-7pm at
Sherlocks @ 183 and Burnet.  Sponsored by SOS Security and Gigamon. Our
sponsors have provided an Apple TV for a giveaway at the end of the
evening, so don't miss out on the drinks, food and good conversation!

*Happy Hour RSVP*: <A HREF="http://owasphr0112.eventbrite.com">http://owasphr0112.eventbrite.com</A>   (not the same as the
