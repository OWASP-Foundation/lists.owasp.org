<PRE>Austin OWASPers,



There will be a Half-Day Threat Modeling Seminar on February 9th, from
1:00pm to 4:30pm. The event is co-hosted by ISSA and OWASP Austin.


*
**Topic:** &quot;**Threat Modeling**&quot;*

How will attackers break your web application? How much security testing is
enough? Do I have to worry about insiders? Threat modeling, applied with a
risk management approach can answer both of these questions if done
correctly. This talk will present advanced threat modeling step-wise
through examples and exercises using the Java EE platform and focusing on
authentication, authorization, and session management.

Participants will learn, through interactive exercise on real software
architectures, how to use diagramming techniques to explicitly document
threats their applications face, identify how assets worth protecting
manifest themselves within the system, and enumerate the attack vectors
these threats take advantage of. Participants will then engage in secure
design activities, learning how to use the threat model to specify
compensating controls for specified attack vectors. Finally, we'll discuss
how the model can drive security testing and validate an application
resists specified attack.

on automation), to security testing. As a consultant, John has provided
strategic direction as a trusted advisor to many multi-national
corporations. John's keen interest in automation keeps Cigital technology
at the cutting edge. He has served as co-editor of the Building Security In
department of IEEE Security &amp; Privacy magazine, speaks with regularity at
conferences and trade shows, and is the leader of the Northern Virginia

Computer Science both from Case Western Reserve University.
