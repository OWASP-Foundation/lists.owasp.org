*Topic*: What's in Your Program? Application Security Maturity in 2012


Take a tour of the most successful software security initiatives in the
world through this presentation of research into application security
practices at over 40 well-known companies. From strategy &amp; metrics to
penetration testing, this study measured over 100 software security
activities across 12 areas, as they are practiced &quot;in the wild.&quot;

covered. You'll come away from this presentation armed with the facts to
plan, implement, and/or enhance your own software security program based on
real-world results.*

If you fail to RSVP, there may not be enough food, so please do so ASAP.


Live Streaming Broadcast We will be streaming the meeting live using
GoToMeeting. If you are unable to attend, you may still hear the meeting
during the scheduled time at <A HREF="https://www3.gotomeeting.com/join/817893494">https://www3.gotomeeting.com/join/817893494</A>
The streaming is a bit on the experimental side, so no guarantees this will
all work perfectly. We're still working out the kinks, but we are excited
to offer this as a method to join us in our meetings. You will get to enjoy
the slide deck and the audio using the method, but will miss out on the
networking and the food, so come on out if you are able. If you do use the
GoToMeeting method, we'd love to hear feedback about your experience.
