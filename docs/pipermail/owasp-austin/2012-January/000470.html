<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

The first Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a little over a week
away! Come over to Sherlocks on Thursday, January 19th from 5-7 PM at
Sherlocks at 183 and Burnet. Join us for food and drinks sponsored this
month by SOS Security and Gigamon. Make sure to bring your business cards
as our sponsors will be giving away a free Apple TV! Come out for the food,
drinks, and good conversations with other Austin InfoSec geeks and maybe
win a very cool prize. Please RSVP below.

*InfoSec Study Group*

Remember that the InfoSec study group starts up again this week on
Wednesday from 12:00p-1:00p at National Instruments. The study group meets
in Building A Once in Building A take the
elevator to the 2nd floor, go down the hallway to your left past the
restrooms and turn left down the small hallway directly after the
restrooms. Conference room 217 will be the second door on the right. You
will have internet access and we'll have a projector for examples. Feel
free to call Ben Broussard at (512) 944-2210 for details or directions.

*
January Chapter Meeting*

Our January Chapter meeting will take place January 31, 2012, 11:30am -
1:00pm and the topic will be &quot;What's in Your Program? Application Security
Maturity in 2012&quot; presented by Joel Scambray of Cigital. Lunch will be
provided and I will send out another announcement for this meeting a little
later this month with more details and an RSVP link.

I want to thank Josh Sokol and James Wickett for the work they have done in
2010 and 2011.  OWASP Austin is what it is mostly because of their efforts,
and I am very honored to help continue that work. I'm looking forward to
working with you all these next two years. If you have any ideas, if you
have a passion to work on some project or fulfill some role in OWASP
Austin, please let me know. We have a very talented group of people!

Thank You,

David Hughes, CISSP
President
OWASP Austin
