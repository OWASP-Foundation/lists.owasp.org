<PRE>Howdy Austin OWASPers!

Just a quick message to remind everyone to sign up by this Friday, July
24th, for the months chapter meeting.  Hope to see everyone there!

---------------------

OWASP Austin March Chapter Meeting, July 28th
When: Tuesday, July 28th @ 11:45 - 1PM

Title: The EMV Card Standard - What is it and How Does it Work?

Europay MasterCard Visa (EMV) is a global standard by introducing a
microprocessor chip into all debit and credit cards. This chip which will
eventually replace the current magnetic strip on the back of credit cards
as a means of mitigating credit card fraud. All U.S. merchants will be
required to support EMV by October, 2015.

This new standard has been in use in Europe and Asia for many years and has
proven to be an improvement over the mag stripe. However, there are new
risks associated with the chip and the debate of the proper implementation
of this new standard (e.g. the advantage over &#8220;chip-and-pin&#8221; vs.
&#8220;chip-and-signature&#8221;) will continue for some time.

What is this new technology and how will it be used in transactions? The
physical and logical security characteristics of this new standard will be
presented, new risks will be addressed and security recommendations will be
given.
