Subject: [Owasp-austin] Elastic Security Analytics Seminar (11/6) hosted by
	National Instruments
Message-ID: <CAFwvDeytpgmBwTzzYfd-54PVB0tO5HE-uh_YKDq3=8i4VuAvEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP Austin,

I wanted to let you all know that Elastic will be conducting an Elastic
Security Analytics Seminar at National Instruments on Tuesday, November 6,
2018 from 11:30 to 2 PM.  If you've ever been curious about Elastic/ELK or
want to learn how to use it to conduct Security Analytics activities, then
this is a great free resource for you.  Lunch will be provided, but if you
can't make it in person, there's an online feed available as well.  Seating
is limited so please RSVP with the link below:

https://events.elastic.co/2018-11-06SecurityAnalyticsSeminarTX-Austin

Here's some additional information about the event:

*Overview:*

The Elastic Stack helps thousands of organizations ensure quality of
service and improve infrastructure performance and reliability. You will
learn how to:

- eliminate potential blind spots by converging all data without
limitations on size, source format, or artificial ingestion rate caps.

- identify threats more quickly by interrogating data at the speed of
thought and quickly pivoting through data to answer critical questions
immediately.

- reduce dwell time by alerting on potential threats earlier in the kill
chain using relationship analysis and machine learning.

*Agenda:*

- Introductions and the Elastic Stack in Security Analytics

- Identify and Prepare: Mapping Your Assets

- Detect: Alerting and Event Correlation, Identifying Anomalies, and Threat
Hunting

- Respond and Recover: Integrating with Case Management Systems

- Deploying and Scaling the Elastic Stack

- Concluding Comments and Next Steps to Get Started

Hi all,


We want to hear from you! It?s time to help us choose the next topic for the OWASP security study group. Please cast your vote for the 3 books that will most inspire you to regularly attend these sessions, which meet every Thursday from noon to 1:00 at National Instruments (building A, room 217). As a matter of courtesy, if you know for certain that you will not be attending these meetings, please refrain from voting because it may skew the results.

You can vote on the next topics here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/C9V5GXC

The voting will be open until Monday morning.

Second, next week is LASCON. We have three great trainings available at a great price. Check them out here: <https://lascon.org/tickets/> https://lascon.org/schedule/

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Matt
