 **Reminder** 
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) <
www.austin.owasp.org> is an open community dedicated to enabling
organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications that can
be trusted.  We advocate approaching application security as a people,
process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to
application security includes improvements in all of these areas.

Each month during our chapter meeting, a subject matter expert will
present and discuss one of the OWASP top 10 topics

are free and open to anyone interested in application security.
