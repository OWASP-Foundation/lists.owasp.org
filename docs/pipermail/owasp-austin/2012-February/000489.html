*Austin OWASPers,

Here are some important announcements! Read them carefully. Cash prizes
for those who do so are not completely outside the realm of imagination.
:<i>-)
</I>


 *Chapter Meeting Tomorrow*


*Date:* Tuesday, February 28
 
*Time:* 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM CST (Chapter announcements usually start
around 11:45 with the presenter starting at noon)
 
*Description:* Testing From the Cloud: Is the Sky Falling?
 
More and more IT is being moved to the cloud, why shouldn't your testing
move there too? This talk will cover what it takes to take your testing
tools from your laptop to the cloud using new features of the OWASP Web
Testing Environment (WTE). WTE allows you to create custom installations
of application security tools in the cloud on demand. Has your IP been
shunned? No problem, kill that cloud instance and startup another. Is
your life as mobile as your phone? No problem, a laptop + Internet =
access to all your favorite tools from anywhere. Multiple clients? No
problem, start an an instance for each one. By the end of this talk,
you'll know all you need to fire up an cloud instance with all of your
favorite tools and start having fun.
 
*Speaker:* Matt Tesauro, OWASP Foundation Board Member
 
Matt is currently on the board of the OWASP Foundation and highly
involved in many OWASP projects and committees. Matt is the project
leader of the OWASP WTE (Web Testing Environment) which is the source of
the OWASP Live CD Project and Virtual Machines pre-configured with tools
and documentation for testing web applications. Industry designations
include the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). Matt Tesauro has a B.S. in Economics
and a M.S in Management Information Systems from Texas A&amp;M University.
