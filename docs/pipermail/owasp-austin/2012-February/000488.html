Topic: Adversity: Good for software, good for the soul
Abstract:
Adversity is a fact of software security&#173;bad things happen both
intentionally and accidentally.  In the #infosec field there is a growing
undercurrent of belief that we need to build code that is Rugged meaning
code that is survivable, long-lasting and persistent in the face of
adversity.  When paired with DevOps the Rugged Software movement really
begins to hit a nerve.  The pairing, aptly called Rugged DevOps is where
security becomes an asset to the organization and no longer a drag on
innovation.
The parallels to our daily lives are numerous.  Pages and pages have been
written on the topic and commonly the question of &#179;why bad things happen to
good people?&#178; or some variation thereof comes up.  This question is a
question of our humanness and how we build our worldview around it is of
utmost importance.
This talk will discuss adversity in software and in the soul and how in the
end it works for the good.
Speaker Bio:
James graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2004 with a BBA in MIS,
where he also ran a Web startup company.  After graduating he joined the IT
division of National Instruments, where he worked on systems and operations
for the company&#185;s large-scale web site (ni.com), for several years.  Then he
moved on to lead the Web division of a rapidly growing local startup,
Community Impact. In 2010, he moved back to National Instruments to the R&amp;D
division, where he leads the security and operations team for the company&#185;s
cloud-based SaaS products.
Over the last five years, James has been involved as a chapter leader of the
Austin OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) chapter and served as
