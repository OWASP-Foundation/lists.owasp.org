Hey Texas OWASPers!

One of the OWASP Global Board Members, Tobias Gondrom, is helping to
promote an OWASP project called the OWASP CISO Survey.  Your response will
be kept completely anonymous, it only takes a few minutes of time, and by
completing it, you are helping to shape the future of Internet and software
security.  The aggregated results will be publicly available in the form of
a free report available on owasp.org.  He is currently short on responses
from the USA and I told him that I would try to help by reaching out to our
amazing Texas OWASPers.  If you wouldn't mind completing it, he would
greatly appreciate it.  More information is below.  Thank you!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
OWASP Global Board Member

=======================================

problems of the future that you face.

The survey shall take only a few minutes of your precious time and by
completing it you are helping shape the future of Internet and software
security. At the conclusion of the survey, the aggregated results will be

keeping your information completely anonymous. (If you are interested, the

For those of you wondering what is happening with the OWASP Austin Study
Group, we have been on a little hiatus after finishing up our last topic.
Between activities with LASCON, which wrapped up about 10 days ago, and my
own work-related priorities, I am just now getting around to moving forward
with organizing the next topic selection.  My apologies for the delay.

As mentioned in previous emails, we manage our communication about study
group topics via a Ning social website - http://myowasp.ning.com/.
Specifically, we have a group named OWASP Austin Study Group
<http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup> that contains
discussion forums.  And even more specific to that is a discussion forum
named Future Study Group Ideas (Ongoing Discussion Forum
<http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/future-study-group-ideas-ongoing-discussion-forum>).
If you are interested in participating in the study group, please sign up
for the Ning website, join the *OWASP Austin Study Group*, and post any
ideas you have to the *Future Study Group Ideas* forum.

As for the next topic, we are in the process of narrowing the options and
selecting one.  I hope to have this done within the next week or two.

As for when we will meet next:

   - We will NOT meeting this Thursday, November 6th.


   - With the Thanksgiving holiday coming up at the end of the month, we
   may only have one or two times to meet this month (Thursday, November 13th
   and Thursday, November 20th).  So the likelihood of getting the next topic
   started this month will be tough, especially with time needed to obtain any
   books or other resources.  We do not need to rush into a new topic, though,
   so my main concern is to ensure that those who want to participate are
   aware of the status.


   - With that said, if anyone has something they would like to discuss as
   a "one-off" topic, where it would only take one or two meeting times to
   cover, please contact me with that information and I can coordinate setting
   it up and communicating to others.

I will send a follow-up email as more information is available.

Thanks for your patience.

For those who are interested in the OWASP Austin Study Group, please read
on.

First, I appreciate those who took the time to submit their vote for the
next study group.  We had twice as many responses from last time, so that
helps.  Unfortunately, even with the higher number of responses, they were
very diverse which resulted in fractions of difference in the average
rankings.  However, to create a fair approach to taking everyone's input
into consideration, the next study group topic will be one receiving the
highest average ranking, which is "The Browser Hacker's Handbook".

"Instant Burp Suite Starter" came in a close second, followed by "Threat
Modeling: Designing for Security".

With the top three being so close, perhaps we can discuss making those the
next two topics.

So, what is next?  First, getting the book, which can be found on Amazon or
Barnes and Noble:

   - The Browser Hacker's Handbook
      -
      http://www.amazon.com/Browser-Hackers-Handbook-Wade-Alcorn/dp/1118662091
      -
      http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-browser-hackers-handbook-wade-alcorn/1115807057?ean=9781118662090

For those of you who participated in the majority of meetings in the last
study group, I will contact you separately about the perk that we
previously discussed.

The first meeting would be Thursday next week, December 4th.  But if we
need another week to obtain the books, then it may get pushed out another
week.  I will send out an email to confirm.

Again, thanks for all your input and feedback, and I look forward to seeing
you at the next study group meeting.

For any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

Happy Thanksgiving!
