Subject: [Owasp-austin] New Study Group: Wireshark 101: Essential Skills for
	Network Analysis
Message-ID: <CAFwvDezvShhAMPBux5OZEFjJYxzj7-pm140aWjUbp2empOjF+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Austin OWASPers,

I wanted to let everyone know that we will be starting up a new study group
book next week and there is still plenty of time for you to make plans to
join us.  For this study group session, we will be working our way through
the "Wireshark 101: Essential Skills for Network Analysis" book by Laura
Chappel (ISBN: 1893939723).  The book is divided into 8 chapters with a
total of 46 labs between them plus a challenge at the end of each chapter.
It is full of pictures and uses pre-recorded packet captures for analysis
within Wireshark.  If you've ever wondered what your traffic looks like as
it flies around on a network, then this is the book for you.

This is a brand new study group meeting to discuss a brand new book.  We
will meet every Wednesday from 12-1 PM beginning next Wednesday, May 15 in
National Instruments, Building A, Room 217.  For the first session we will
be going through the process of installing Wireshark, talking about some
basic networking concepts, and maybe even performing our first packet
capture.  If you have any questions, you can ask them in the forum topic
dedicated to this study group here:

http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/topics/study-group-wireshark-101

Get your book ordered today and we're all looking forward to seeing you
next week.  Take care!

Message-ID: <519BB68F.4010600@gmail.com>

Austin OWASPers,

Add the following upcoming events to your calendars!


    May OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting -- Dustin Kirkland, Gazzang.com

*When:* Tuesday, May 28th, from 11:30am-1:30pm

/Where:'/ National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Topic: *Encrypt Everything Everywhere (but *especially* in the Cloud)

*Abstract:*

72% of the 21 million U.S. health care records that have been
compromised since 2009 should have been trivially protected using
comprehensive encryption of the data before being written to disk
(see: http://1.usa.gov/a2UGEG). A busy cloud compute node from OpenStack
or Amazon EC2 might spin up thousands of instances per day. Ephemeral,
block, and object storage - each and every one of these should always be
encrypted before being written to the underlying physical media. The
good news is multiple excellent file and disk encryption solutions exist
in Linux, such as eCryptfs and dm-crypt,making encrypting everything
simple and cost-effective.This session is designed for security
professionals, IT decision makers and solution architects. We'll discuss
encryption and key management best practices and examine use cases for
companies that store sensitive and regulated data in the cloud.

*Speaker Bio:* Dustin Kirkland is the CTO at Gazzang, delivering data
security and encryption for cloud computing and big data using eCryptfs,
dmcrypt, and an innovative key management system called zTrustee. Dustin
is also an active Core Developer of the Ubuntu Linux distribution,
maintainer of 20+ open source projects, and the creator of Byobu,
zEscrow, DivItUp.com, and LinuxSearch.org. A Fightin' Texas Aggie Class
of 2001 graduate, Dustin lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife Kim,
daughter, and his two Australian Shepherds, Aggie and Tiger.
