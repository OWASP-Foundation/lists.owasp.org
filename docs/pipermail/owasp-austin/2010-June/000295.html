   The Austin OWASP chapter is paying to have Brad Causey fly in from       
   Alabama to present on AJAX Security, a topic that we've never had before 
   at Austin OWASP meetings.

  We will discuss what AJAX is, and how the different technologies combine  
  to make it up. We will discuss some of the unique features, toolkits, and 
  coding considerations, as well as security pitfalls, and ways to protect  
  and detect them.
