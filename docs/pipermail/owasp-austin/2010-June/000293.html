<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers!

To start with, as I mentioned during our last meeting, we are in need of a 
speaker for our July 27 meeting.  This is the week of the Blackhat 
Conference so it's been a little bit harder than usual to recruit a 
presenter for you for that date.  If you have an idea for a presentation 
that you would like to share with the group, please shoot me an e-mail and 
let me know.  I'd also like to give everyone forewarning that the July 
meeting will be held in the room off of our Mopac B cafeteria due to a 
sales conference being held in our normal meeting location.  Rest assured, 
we will make sure this information makes it on the meeting invitation and 
will have reminder signs in the Mopac C lobby and hopefully escorts to 
show you the way.  I apologize for the inconvenience.

Please make sure to mark your calendar for Thursday, June 17 from 5-7 PM 
for the next Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour.  The event will be 
held at Sherlock's (9012 Research Blvd) and we would like to sincerely 
thank Set Solutions for stepping up to sponsor it.  These events are 
extremely fun, feature free food and drinks, and you'll find no better 
opportunity to chat with 30+ of Austin's finest security professionals. 
See you there!

Next, I wanted to mention that we have a very special treat for our June 
29 Austin OWASP meeting.  The chapter has paid for Brad Causey to come and 
speak to us about AJAX Security.  Brad works for a major international 
financial institution as a Security Analyst and is the President of the 
OWASP Alabama Chapter.  He is an avid author and writer with hundreds of 
publications and several books.  This presentation will discuss what AJAX 
is, some of the toolkits and coding considerations, as well as security 
pitfalls and ways to protect and detect them. 

Lastly, we've made a couple of announcements about this at meetings, but 
the Austin OWASP Chapter is working on putting together a conference which 
will be held here in Austin tentatively around the end of October.  We 
will be looking for both Conference Organizers and Functional Leaders 
(Descriptions available here) to assist us in this effort.  If you are 
interested in helping out with the conference and have not already talked 
to us about it, please e-mail James Wickett (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">james.wickett at ni.com</A>).
