Happy New Year Austin OWASPers!

First off, after two years of serving as the Austin OWASP Chapter 
President, James Wickett has decided to step aside and let someone else 
take the reigns for a while.  As such, he has asked me to take over as 
President beginning this month.  James has some pretty big shoes to fill 
(pun intended), but I will try my hardest to continue to make the Austin 
OWASP Chapter one of the best in the country.  If you have any suggestions 
on how we can make that happen, please do not hesitate to shoot me an 
e-mail.  And don't worry, James will continue to be very active with 
OWASP, serving as the chapter's new Vice President.

Austin Security Executives Happy Hours - Thursday, January 14, 5-7 PM
On to more pressing business...we've decided to kick the new year off 
right with another super awesome Happy Hour event.  From now on, we're 
joining forces with the Capitol of Texas ISSA group and calling these the 
Austin Security Executives Happy Hour.  The first Happy Hour event is 
scheduled for this Thursday (1/14) from 5-7 PM at Sherlock's (183 and 
Burnet).  Past happy hours have proven to be quite awesome so don't miss 
out on this opportunity to network with your security comrades and drink 
cheap drinks. 

Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization - Tuesday, January 
26, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting 
topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization. 
The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of 
passing around the data itself.  For example, why would you give a 
customer account representative a full credit card number when all they 
need to do their job is the last four digits?  Using tokenization, we are 
able to reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems 
that actually store the data.  This extremely simplifies audits for 
regulations like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.  This presentation will cover 
the business drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how to 
implement it.  If your organization has data to protect, then you're going 
to want to check out this presentation.

We are currently in the process of lining up meeting topics for the coming 
months.  If you are interested in presenting on a topic or have some 
topics that you think would be good for someone else to present at an 
OWASP meeting, please send me an e-mail to let me know.  Thanks!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CCNA, GWAS)
Austin OWASP President

Austin OWASPers,

Please don't forget that the Security Executives Happy Hour will be 
happening tonight (Thursday, January 14) from 5-7 PM at Sherlock's.  If 
the weather is nice, we'll probably be sitting out on the patio, but if 
it's still raining, we'll try for one of the side rooms on the inside (the 
room on the right if it's open).  Hopefully most of you know who I am by 
now, but if not I'm wearing a long-sleeve navy blue shirt with an OWASP 
logo on it.  See you tonight!

Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Meeting 1/26/2010 - Reducing Your Data
 Security Risk Through Tokenization
Message-ID: <OF093B8189.80A01917-ON862576B1.0058CA58-862576B1.005C0B7D@ni.com>

Hello OWASPers!

I wanted to remind everyone that we will be having our first Austin OWASP 
meeting of the year next Tuesday, January 26.  The meeting will be held at 
our usual location (National Instruments - Building C) in our usual room 
during our usual time (11:30 AM to 1:00 PM).  The topic for the meeting is 
"Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization" and I will be 
presenting, but I'd really like for this to be a discussion where everyone 
can share their thoughts on Tokenization in the enterprise.  A summary of 
what I intend to talk about is below.

Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization - Tuesday, January 
26, 2010, 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM
The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting 
topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization. 
The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of 
passing around the data itself. For example, why would you give a customer 
account representative a full credit card number when all they need to do 
their job is the last four digits? Using tokenization, we are able to 
reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems that 
actually store the data. This extremely simplifies audits for regulations 
like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. This presentation will cover the business 
drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how to implement 
it. If your organization has data to protect, then you're going to want to 
check out this presentation. 

Austin Security Executives Happy Hour - Thursday, February 11, 2010, 5:00 
PM - 7:00 PM
The January happy hour event was a huge success with over 27 of the best 
and brightest security executives in attendance.  If you weren't one of 
them, then you were certainly missing out, but we're willing to give you 
another chance.  We've scheduled another happy hour event for Thursday, 
February 11 from 5-7 PM at the same location (Sherlock's on Burnet and 
183).  Even better, WhiteHat Security (http://www.whitehatsec.com) has 
graciously offered to sponsor the event so look forward to food and drinks 
on them.  Don't miss out on this exciting opportunity to network with your 
fellow security executives!

  Topic: Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization              
                                                                            
                                                                            
  The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting     
  topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization.   
  The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of      
  passing around the data itself. For example, why would you give a         
  customer account representative a full credit card number when all they   
  need to do their job is the last four digits? Using tokenization, we are  
  able to reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems   
  that actually store the data. This extremely simplifies audits for        
  regulations like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. This presentation will cover    
  the business drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how   
  to implement it. If your organization has data to protect, then you're    
  going to want to check out this presentation.
