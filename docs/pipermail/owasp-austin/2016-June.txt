Hello Everyone!


This month's OWASP Austin Chapter meeting will be on Tuesday, June 28,
2016.


*Please **RSVP on Eventbrite*
<http://owasp-austin-2016-june.eventbrite.com/> so that the food order can
be placed to ensure enough food for everyone.  Also, only those who RSVP
and attend will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may take place!


Following are the details of the meeting:


------------------------------------------------------------


OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, June 28th from 11:30 AM to
1:00 PM


*Game of Hacks: Play, Hack & Track*


Playing around with some ideas we found ourselves creating a hacker magnet.
Game of Hacks, built using the node.js framework, displays a range of
vulnerable code snippets challenging the player to locate the
vulnerability. A multiplayer option makes the challenge even more
attractive and the leaderboard spices up things when players compete for a
seat on the iron throne. Within 24 hours we had 35K players test their
hacking skills...we weren't surprised when users started breaking the
rules. Join us to:

   - Play GoH against the audience in real time and get your claim for fame
   - Understand how vulnerabilities were planted within Game of Hacks
   - See real attack techniques (some caught us off guard) and how we
   handled them
   - Learn how to avoid vulnerabilities in your code and how to go about
   designing a secure application
   - Hear what to watch out for on the ultra-popular node.js framework.

*Speaker: *Igor Matlin


Igor has over 19 years of technical experience in high-tech companies as a
software engineer and technical lead. Prior to joining Checkmarx as our
Senior Solutions Architect, Igor worked as a Technical Manager at Myriad, a
leading mobile software company, and as a Software Engineer and Product
Manager at Novarra, acquired by Nokia in 2010. Igor is an appreciated
speaker at forums such as ISC2, BSides, and OWASP.



Igor studied at Belarusian State University of Informatics and
Radioelectronics and received his B.Sc in Computer Science and Math from
Christian Brothers University.


*RSVP* ? http://owasp-austin-2016-june.eventbrite.com


*Food:* Taco Deli. Please RSVP so we can be sure to have enough for all!


*Location: *National Instruments, 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Building C,
Austin, TX 78759

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Austin,
 TX : Introduction to reverse engineering training on July 21 & 22
 (limited seating)
Message-ID: <BY2PR0201MB1543BCD4DD42EC07F8897044D0220@BY2PR0201MB1543.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

Austin OWASP is hosting a two-day training on July 21 and July 22 on reverse engineering. This class was announced today at the chapter meeting. It is already over 20% full. Sign up as soon as possible if you want to attend because seating is limited. I expect this class to fill up late next week or early the week after that.

This class will be at no cost to attendees thanks to National Instruments, Austin OWASP and the instructor.

Why learn reverse engineering?


1.    To debug applications

2.    To get a deeper understanding of how an application works and interacts with other applications

3.    To learn how applications are exploited

4.    As a foundation for malware analysis

5.    As a foundation for binary exploitation

6.    As a foundation for vulnerability research

More information and sign up is here: https://austin-owasp-re.eventbrite.com

I will also be hosting an assembly language study group in July to help students get the most out of this class. If you are interested, email me and let me know.

Thanks,

Matt Pardo
Education & Training, Austin OWASP
