Title: OWASP Austin Meeting - Static Analysis Techniques for Testing Application 
Security
Time: Tue Mar 25 11:30 - 13:00 (Timezone: Central Time)
Where: Whole Foods Downtown
Calendar: 
Description: Topic: Static Analysis Techniques for Testing Application Security

Static Analysis of software refers to examining source code and
other software artifacts without executing them. This presentation
looks at how these techniques can be used to identify security defects
in applications. Approaches examined will range from simple keyword
search methods used to identify calls to banned functions through more
sophisticated data flow analysis used to identify more complicated
issues such as injection flaws. In addition, a demonstration will be
given of two freely-available static analysis tools: FindBugs for the
Java platform and FXCop for the .NET platform. Finally, some approaches
will be presented on how organizations can start using static analysis
tools as part of their development and quality assurance processes.
When: March 25th, 2008, 11:30am - 1:00pm 
Who: Dan Cornell, Principal of Denim Group, Ltd., OWASP San Antonio Leader, Creator of Sprajax
Dan Cornell has over ten years of experience architecting and
developing web-based software systems. He leads Denim Group's security
research team in investigating the application of secure coding and
development techniques to improve web-based software development
methodologies.
Dan was the founding coordinator and chairman for the Java
Users Group of San Antonio (JUGSA) and is currently the San Antonio
chapter leader of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). He
is a recognized expert in the area of web application security for
SearchSoftwareQuality.com and the primary author of Sprajax, OWASP's
open source tool for assessing the security of AJAX-enabled web
applications.
