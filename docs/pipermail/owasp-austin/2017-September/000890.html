<PRE>Hello everyone!

The *Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) 2017
&lt;<A HREF="https://lascon.org/">https://lascon.org/</A>&gt; *is now about a month away, and we are so excited
about what all that will provide us in the way of pre-conference training,
conference sessions, and just being able to socialize with like-minded
professionals.  We take pride in having a conference where it is not too
big and not too small.

Some updates to highlight:

   - We added another *2-Day pre-conference training* to our options,
   provided by Daniel Crowley.  Following are his and the other trainings
   offered by these very experienced trainers:
