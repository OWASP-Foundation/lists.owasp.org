Austin OWASPers,

Make sure you mark your calendars for Thursday, February 10 as the next 
Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Cisco.  Our January 
event brought out 40-50 people and an awesome time was had by all.  I 
heard some concerns from people about the vendor sponsors of these events 
when I asked why some people weren't making it out.  For those of you 
worried about that, don't.  The vendors are all told in advance that they 
are not getting lists of attendees or anything like that.  Any business 
card exchanges or vendor conversations are typically self-initiated and 
usually have nothing to do with the products which they support.  This 
event is also open to everyone so if you feel more comfortable bringing a 
spouse or significant other, please do so.  If you didn't make it in 
January, hopefully you can come out this month and take advantage of this 
opportunity to have free drinks and food and network in a very informal 
atmosphere.

We had our first meeting on the OWASP Secure Password Project yesterday 
with a great group of people who are excited about working on it.  That 
said, it looks like we could really use some developer talent on the team. 
 If you're a code monkey who has a little bit of spare time for a really 
cool security project, please let me know.  Even if you're not a developer 
and are interested in helping, we still have plenty of work to do.  Just 
shoot me an e-mail to let me know you are interested and I'll add you to 
the mailing list.

Speaking of the OWASP Secure Password Project, one of our contributors, 
Rick Redman, will be presenting on the topic of "Supercharged Password 
Cracking Techniques" at our next meeting.  It's a pretty awesome talk on 
the research he's done on the common passwords that people use and the 
tools that penetration testers use to break them.  Hopefully this will get 
you excited enough about the chapter project to volunteer some of your 
time if you haven't already.

I've had a couple of cool educational opportunities come across my desk 
lately that I'd like to share with you.  The first is an ISSA Birds of a 
Feather session on "Defining a Security Program in Business Terms" 
presented by Brandon Dunlap of Brightfly, Inc.  It is from 6-8:30 PM on 
Thursday, February 24th.  It is free for ISSA members and $10 for 
non-members.  The second opportunity is the free B-Sides Security 
Conference happening March 11 and 12 in downtown Austin.  Both have 
provided PDF documents which I have attached to this e-mail, but in case 
you don't get them or don't trust them, more information is available at:

We have a problem.  It appears that Sherlock's overbooked our reservation
with a private party in the party room and is completely packed.  We are
going to try to move the happy hour across the street to Bagpipes instead
(though they're not answering their phone right now).

   My apologies!

Event Details:
------------------------------ 

<div><span class="vevent"><span class="description"><strong>When:</strong> February 22, 2011, 11:30am - 1:00pm <br /><br /><strong>Topic:</strong> Supercharged Password Cracking Techniques<br /></span></span></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div>In the past 2-3 years there ha<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">ve been many important discoveries/releases in the world of </span><span style="color: black; background-color: #ffffff;">password</span> cracking. Between massive <span style="color: black; background-color: #ffffff;">password</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
 leaks (like RockYou, Gawker, etc) and the release of many free tools 
that take advantage of the processing power of GPU cards, there are many
 new techniques/tools/tricks that security professionals should be 
taking advantage of while cracking passwords. But, by default tools you 
download (Like John the Ripper) do not take advantage of this.</span></div>
<div style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br /></div>
<div style="background-color: #ffffff;">Over the past 12 years, Rick has been collecting <span style="color: black;">password</span>
 hashes from various large corporations (during authorized penetration 
tests). For years now, he has been cracking these passwords, and 
discovering more and more patterns that users are using. But the 
majority of <span style="color: black;">password</span> cracking tools out there (Such as John the Ripper, L0phtCrack, etc) do not take advantage of these "human weaknesses" in <span style="color: black;">password</span>
 creation. So far Rick has cracked almost 4 million hashes from inside 
corporate America, and an additional 5+ million from sources over the 
Internet.</div>
<div style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br /></div>
<div style="background-color: #ffffff;">During this talk Rick will talk about the current state of <span style="color: black;">password</span>
 cracking by walking the attendees through a PWDUMP output file 
containing 49000+ real "complex" NTLM passwords) how the default 
rule-set provided by John the Ripper can be improved to crack tens of 
thousands of additional passwords. Wordlists/Dictionaries will be shared
 that can help you better crack passwords (these wordlists were created 
based on what users are _actually_ doing in Fortune 500 environments). 
New "rules" will be given out that were created to specifically attack 
the patterns that users are choosing.</div>
<div style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br /></div>
<div><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">This is relevant to OWASP, because the applications we are 
developing/securing almost always have logins and passwords that protect
 them. But, unlike Operating Systems, our web applications do not 
usually have strict </span><span style="color: black; background-color: #ffffff;">password</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
 requirements that users have to meet in order to create an account. We 
do this as to not scare away users; but we are placing our O</span>WN systems 
at risk.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Even now, sites like Google/Twitter/Facebook only warn the users 
about poor passwords, or have a list of 500 passwords that are not 
allowed. This will _not_ be the case in 10 years. Lets address this 
problem now.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The only way to address the problem, is to first become aware of 
how bad our users are at choosing passwords , and what we can do (as 
developers or security professionals) to help protect our users from 
themselves.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Who</strong>: Rick Redman (Korelogic)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>During his 12 years as a security practitioner, Rick has delivered 
numerous application and network penetration tests for a wide range of 
Fortune 500 and government clients. He serves as KoreLogic's subject 
matter expert in advance<span style="color: black; background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">d </span>password</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">

topics such as web application security. Rick also delivers web

supporting Sandia National Laboratories. Mr. Redman is a graduate of 
Purdue University with a degree in Computer Science from the 
COAST/CERIAS program under Eugene Spafford. Rick started performing

Hey everyone,

I have been catching up on OWASP reading and was wondering what you think of
these articles concerning engagement with developers?

http://www.curphey.com/2011/02/owasp-has-it-reached-a-tipping-point/

http://appsandsecurity.blogspot.com/2011/02/security-people-vs-developers.html

I send these not to get you worried about the future of OWASP, but more for
the Austin chapter to engage our localized development communities (Ruby,
ACUG, Python, ...).  We should use these articles as motivation to drive our
vision for the Austin chapter of OWASP.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
James

If you're planning on coming to the "Supercharged Password Cracking 
Techniques" presentation at the Austin OWASP meeting today, I've got two 
important updates for you:

Lunch is going to be provided (while it lasts) courtesy of the OWASP 
Austin board and the Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) 
crew.  Tacodeli......yummy!  As usual National Instruments will be 
providing drinks and cookies as well.
If you're an official OWASP member, today is your lucky day.  Kate sent me 
a whole box of T-shirts and stickers which we will be distributing to 
current members at today's meeting.  You've gotta be on the official 
membership list (
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p6IFyntQTi7sxa2Xjx191BA) in order 
to get one.  I've also got the OWASP patches that were supposed to be on 
the bags from LASCON if you didn't get one at the last meeting.

I hope to see you at 11:30 today!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)

I think one interesting thing about both links is they accept the idea of a
"security person." Two blog entries and a series of comments where the
division is just accepted...

It seems to accept developers aren't "security people," which is largely
true.  But the same could be said of managers, network engineers and many
others who haven't been educated specifically on security - or put it into
practice. Even building architects and construction teams don't always know
the basics of some physical security. So, who is a security person?

A little speculation, but usually when there's an "us" and "them"
discussion, it probably means there's not a lot of "them" in the room. That
might be the problem for the larger OWASP community or the conference
environment this question came up in.
