Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour sponsored by Veracode, September
10th
When: Thursday, September 10th, 5pm-7pm

Where: Sherlocks Baker Street Pub and Grill, 183 & Burnet (we meet in the
large room to the right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the
room.)

What: The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec

OWASP Austin September Chapter Meeting, September 29th
When: Tuesday, September 29th @ 11:45 - 1PM

Title: Log Everything, even if it is just on local disks

Logs are as important as SQLi, XSS or Secure Coding! OWASP has a ?Logging
Cheat Sheet?, and there are the ?Windows Logging Cheat Sheet?, ?Windows
PowerShell Logging Cheat Sheet?, ?Windows Splunk Logging Cheat Sheet? and
several other I created, but we still lack an understanding of logging when
it comes to Application Security and DevOps.

Enabling and configuration of logs must become as basic and a standard
practice as doing WebApp security scans, secure code reviews or secure
webapp design, which should include application log design and
implementation. You don?t need an expensive log management solution to do
good application security or DevOps log configuration. What we need is to
include all our Cheat Sheets into DevOps builds so enabling and
configuration is baked in and to include a log design review as a part of
our application secure reviews. So WHEN we need log data, it is there for
us.

Speaker: Michael Gough

Michael is the founder of "Malware Archaeology" and has 20 years experience
in IT and Information Security and currently in the Healthcare sector. In
the past Michael has been a consultant for HP and other consultancies, an
analyst for the Financial sector, Health Care and State of Texas. Michael
now focuses his talents as a Blue Team Defender, malwarian fighter and
malware archeologist, protecting his employer from nefarious
ne`er-do-wellers.

Michael also led BSides Texas with Michelle Klinger for 6 years and led the
BSides Austin conference held in March. Michael discovered the WinNTI
malware 10 months before Kasperski released their report. He also
discovered and exploited a major Card Key system flaw back in 2010 which
can be found on YouTube.

Michael is a creator of the Malware Management Framework, a process to help
discover malware on Windows based systems. Michael also developed the
?Windows Logging Cheat Sheet? to provide a starting point on detailed
logging for Windows hosts.

Michael's resources may be found on his website: MalwareArchaeology

Food: It will be a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough
for all!

Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

For those of you interested in participating in the OWASP Study Group, this
is a follow-up message to let you know that we have decided on the book
titled "*Snapshot - Reading and Treating People Right the First Time*" by
Dan Korem. The book can only be purchased from the following online store
and only as hardcover (no electronic format). Cost of book is $34.95 retail.

   - Amazon -

The chapter will purchase books for those who participated in the last
study group and attended over 70% of the meetings.  A separate message will
be sent to those individuals.

We will use the
http://my.owasp.org/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-2015-snapshot
discussion forum to share thoughts and have discussions on this book.
Please be sure to *sign up* for the site, *join* the OWASP Austin Study
Group, and *follow* the discussion forum so that you can get alerts on
posts to the forum.

As for the starting date, we have decided on *Thursday, October 1, 2015*.
We wanted to give more time to obtain the book, and not conflict with the
OWASP AppSecUSA date (week of 9/21).

Please let me know of any questions or concerns.

Looking forward to seeing you next month!

Howdy OWASP Austin-ites!

There is a great training event coming soon by local guru Michael Gough.
Due to circumstances beyond Michael's control, the training schedule has
shifted around a bit but is ready next month October 5-6.  Normally the
training is $999 when associated with a conference, but for the local
community, Michael is providing a huge discount.. only $99 per seat!

Sign-up at: http://malwarearchaeology.eventbrite.com
Use the event code: "ATXInfoSecCommunity"

This training is structured to use within our real jobs and the balance
between dealing with malware in our environment and our normal duties.  If
you are a full time IT or InfoSec professional or a consultant that deals
with multiple clients, this training will show you how to quickly give you
a sense that a system is infected of malware free and where to find it.  It
will also walk you through how to analyze at a basic level to extract just
the actionable data you need, such as IP addresses, domains, files dropped,
locations and tweaks to the system that were made so you can remediate it
or decide to re-image the system.  All geared to evaluating the system in
about 1 hour, so you can get back to your normal job duties.


Sign-up by Sept 18th to reserve your spot at a great training!

Thank you!

PS:  The training is not affiliated with OWASP, but should be great!

Message-ID: <CAFwvDewAwdeOKjUo_4OHC=eVBdRYio54MOCW_6A5qtqaaF0A1Q@mail.gmail.com>

For those of you who attended my OWASP presentation last month on personal
OpSec, one of the things I talked about was being prepared for when a
disaster strikes.  To that end, I came across a good deal today on Woot for
$99 for a 30 day supply of freeze-dried/dehydraded food (3 meals/day = 2100
calories) that lasts 15-20 years.

http://www.woot.com/offers/chefs-banquet-ark-330-emergency-food-supply

No clue how it tastes, but that's about $50 cheaper than the cheapest I've
seen elsewhere for these.

Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu_EqLc9XryFXWd0tSJkAD5MtTSyvm4uNiDBbgzQohRgiQ@mail.gmail.com>

For those of you interested in participating in the OWASP Study Group, this
is a reminder that we will be starting up tomorrow (Thursday) to cover the
book titled "*Snapshot - Reading and Treating People Right the First Time*"
by Dan Korem. The book can only be purchased from the following online
store and only as hardcover (no electronic format). Cost of book is $34.95
retail.

We will use the
http://my.owasp.org/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-2015-snapshot
discussion forum to share thoughts and have discussions on this book.
Please be sure to *sign up* for the site, *join* the OWASP Austin Study
Group, and *follow* the discussion forum so that you can get alerts on
posts to the forum.

We will begin tomorrow by doing a high level review of the contents and
decide on how best to break up the discussions (i.e. by chapter).  Also, we
will need to discuss upcoming dates which we may need to skip due to other
events.  For example, next Thursday (10/8) is InnoTech and later in the
month (10/22) is LASCON.  Most likely we may skip those meeting days and
continue the following week.  Any decisions will be posted on the Study
Group discussion forum.

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!

OWASP Austin Training/Study Coordinator
