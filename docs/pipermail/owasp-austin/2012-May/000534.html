      May OWASP Chapter Meeting


*When:* May 29th, from 11:30a-1:00pm

*Topic:*: &quot;Closing the window of opportunity&quot;(Jim Manico and Siri De
Licori of WhiteHat Security)

*Abstract*:&quot;Closing the window of opportunity&quot; and will be discussing
the state of web application security based on recent statistics drawn
from WhiteHat's database of thousands of sites under service and the
characteristics of a program that can help organizations develop a
strong web security posture and reduce or eliminate the opportunities
attackers have to compromise their applications.

This will be a product agnostic presentation, of course, though we will
be using WhiteHat data (along with Jim's long experience) to present the
problems we see and how we can go about solving them.


*Speakers:*

is part of the WhiteHat Static Analysis Software Testing (SAST) team,

WhiteHat using his 7+ years of experience delivering developer-training

vulnerability data and integrates DAST and SAST results.  He has also
worked with Jeremiah to produce statistics for a number of his quarterly
reports and whitepapers.

Siri comes from a background of 10 years of development.  He worked with
a small software company working on an early rapid application
development tool that produced code from UML diagrams, a small nonprofit
on a tool to permit English and Chinese speakers to study the bible in
its original tongues without learning those ancient languages, and a
couple Fortune 500 companies helping them process, utilize, and analyze
their financial data.  Before being recruited into product management he
specialized in building database systems and data analytics.

Siri works at WhiteHat's home office in Santa Clara and lives in San
