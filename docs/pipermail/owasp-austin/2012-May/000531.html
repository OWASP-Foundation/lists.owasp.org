<PRE>
      All, my apologies but I think my Eventbrite notice had some
      erroneous info date in it. That's what you get for trying to save
      time by using the previous month as a &quot;template&quot;. The OWASP
      chapter meeting is May 29th, the last Tuesday of the month as
      usual. My apologies for the confusion. DO NOT TRY TO ATTEND THE
      MAY OWASP CHAPTER MEETING IN APRIL. :-D

      May OWASP Chapter Meeting


*When:* May 29th, from 11:30a-1:00pm

*Topic:*: &quot;Closing the window of opportunity&quot;(Jim Manico and Siri De
Licori of WhiteHat Security)

*Abstract*:&quot;Closing the window of opportunity&quot; and will be discussing
the state of web application security based on recent statistics drawn
from WhiteHat's database of thousands of sites under service and the
characteristics of a program that can help organizations develop a
strong web security posture and reduce or eliminate the opportunities
attackers have to compromise their applications.

This will be a product agnostic presentation, of course, though we will
be using WhiteHat data (along with Jim's long experience) to present the
problems we see and how we can go about solving them.


*Speakers:*

Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security. Jim
is part of the WhiteHat Static Analysis Software Testing (SAST) team,
leading the data-driven, Web service portion of the SAST service. He

WhiteHat using his 7+ years of experience delivering developer-training
courses for SANS, Aspect Security and others.

worked with Jeremiah to produce statistics for a number of his quarterly
reports and whitepapers.

Siri comes from a background of 10 years of development.  He worked with
a small software company working on an early rapid application
development tool that produced code from UML diagrams, a small nonprofit
on a tool to permit English and Chinese speakers to study the bible in
its original tongues without learning those ancient languages, and a

their financial data.  Before being recruited into product management he
specialized in building database systems and data analytics.
