      May OWASP Chapter Meeting


*When:* May 29th, from 11:30a-1:00pm

*Topic:*: &quot;Closing the window of opportunity&quot;(Jim Manico and Siri De
Licori of WhiteHat Security)

*Abstract*:&quot;Closing the window of opportunity&quot; and will be discussing
the state of web application security based on recent statistics drawn
from WhiteHat's database of thousands of sites under service and the
characteristics of a program that can help organizations develop a
strong web security posture and reduce or eliminate the opportunities
attackers have to compromise their applications.

This will be a product agnostic presentation, of course, though we will
be using WhiteHat data (along with Jim's long experience) to present the
problems we see and how we can go about solving them.


*Speakers:*

reports and whitepapers.

Siri comes from a background of 10 years of development.  He worked with
