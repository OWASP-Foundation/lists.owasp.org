WIN A FREE PASS TO DANIEL VACANTI'S KANBAN CLASS ON MARCH 16TH - 17TH
Daniel Vacanti of David J. Anderson and Associates will lead a Kanban
training class in Austin on Wednesday, March 16th through Thursday, March
17th. Don't miss this rare opportunity to learn from a master of
second-generation agile development.

Signup for David Anderson's talk on March 17th and be automatically entered
into a drawing for a free pass to Daniel's class (winner announced on March
10th).

For more information about the class, see the description at the David J.
Anderson and Associate's website:
http://agilemanagement.net/index.php/Blog/kanban_training_class_in_austin_tx_march_14-15/

* * *
Austin's software development community welcomes David J. Anderson, whose
most-recent book, Kanban, Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology
Business, points the way to second-generation Agile methods, reflecting a
decade's worth of lessons-learned in Agile Software Development and Agile
Management.

Both of David J. Anderson's books have featured chapters describing the use
and value of regular operations reviews of the technology development
organization. David has described operations review as the keystone or lynch
pin of a Kanban initiative to drive the evolution of a Lean organization.
Despite this it remains the least often implemented of the Kanban practices.
This talk will present the why, what and how of operations reviews and
advocate for their greater use as part of a Lean initiative and focal point
for creating a Kaizen culture within your business.

For this very special event, the Austin Software Process Improvement
Network, Lean Software Austin, the Austin Chapter of the IEEE Computer
Society, and Agile Austin join forces to bring you a thought-provoking
evening of ideas that stand to transform how we see and practice software
development.

Food and refreshments for the event are graciously provided by GisLabs. Find
out more about GistLabs at:

When:
Thursday, March 17th @ 6:30pm

Where:
National Instruments

Message-ID: <OF1491F149.0E5E9FE6-ON86257849.005EF830-86257849.005FA669@ni.com>

I have been asked to present at the MIS Training Institute's InfoSec World 
Conference happening at the Disney Contemporary Resort in Orlando, FL 
April 19-21, 2011.  One of the bonuses of presenting is that I get two 
free "colleague" passes to the conference.  After several failed attempts 
to get someone at NI interested in going with me, I am throwing this out 
to the OWASP Austin community.  You have to pay for airfare on your own, 
but the conference is free and I might let you crash on my hotel room 
floor if you're really desperate and I like you enough.  I'll give you a 
few days to think it over and get back to me, but if I don't hear back 
from anyone I'll throw it out to the greater OWASP community as well.  I'm 
including a link below for more details.  Please let me know ASAP if you 
want to hang out with me for 3 days in Orlando and I'll send you my 
super-secret passcode for the free pass.

Great articles. When there is an OWASP meeting that deals with the social
engineering necessary to bridge the gap between security people and
developers I'll be there to represent the developers.

I just spoke to Rodney at Infoblox who informed me that not only are they 
buying your food and drink, but they're going to be giving away some Best 
Buy Gift Cards as well.  Those who attended our January event had 
something like 1:30 odds at winning the iPad (congrats to Mano Paul by the 
way).  Rodney made it sound like he has more than one gift card to give 
away so your odds tonight should be even better!

IMHO, OWASP is for everyone.  As our local chapter President, I've strived 
to find presentations that are as entertaining to auditors as they are 
developers.  Certainly not an easy thing to accomplish, but I think we've 
struck a good balance.

The notion that "Developers don't know <expletive deleted> about security" 
is false on so many levels as are most generalizations.  Developers learn 
what they are taught in school, what they garner through experience, and 
what they seek out on their own.  As OWASP, it is our job to not only be 
the place developers feel comfortable seeking out, but to also help to 
evangelize security within the community and get developers more 
interested.  Messages like the one above, as Rich said, are divisive at 
best and undermine OWASP's core mission of educating the masses on 
security.

I'd like to put this out there for everyone in our Austin OWASP community. 
 Build bridges, not walls.  Make the developers your friends.  Put 
yourself in the trenches with them and hold regular office hours.  Show 
enthusiasm and let them know that security is FUN.  Remember that people 
are motivated by the things *they* want to do, not the things you want 
them to do.

If you haven't done so already, read "How to Win Friends and Influence

Great articles. When there is an OWASP meeting that deals with the social 
engineering necessary to bridge the gap between security people and 
developers I'll be there to represent the developers.

I think one interesting thing about both links is they accept the idea of 
a "security person." Two blog entries and a series of comments where the 
division is just accepted...

It seems to accept developers aren't "security people," which is largely 
true.  But the same could be said of managers, network engineers and many 
others who haven't been educated specifically on security - or put it into 
practice. Even building architects and construction teams don't always 
know the basics of some physical security. So, who is a security person?

A little speculation, but usually when there's an "us" and "them" 
discussion, it probably means there's not a lot of "them" in the room. 
That might be the problem for the larger OWASP community or the conference 
environment this question came up in.

I send these not to get you worried about the future of OWASP, but more 
for the Austin chapter to engage our localized development communities 
(Ruby, ACUG, Python, ...).  We should use these articles as motivation to 
drive our vision for the Austin chapter of OWASP.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

IMHO, OWASP is for everyone.  As our local chapter President, I've strived 
to find presentations that are as entertaining to auditors as they are 
developers.  Certainly not an easy thing to accomplish, but I think we've 
struck a good balance.

The notion that "Developers don't know <expletive deleted> about security" 
is false on so many levels as are most generalizations.  Developers learn 
what they are taught in school, what they garner through experience, and 
what they seek out on their own.  As OWASP, it is our job to not only be 
the place developers feel comfortable seeking out, but to also help to 
evangelize security within the community and get developers more 
interested.  Messages like the one above, as Rich said, are divisive at 
best and undermine OWASP's core mission of educating the masses on 
security.

I'd like to put this out there for everyone in our Austin OWASP community. 
 Build bridges, not walls.  Make the developers your friends.  Put 
yourself in the trenches with them and hold regular office hours.  Show 
enthusiasm and let them know that security is FUN.  Remember that people 
are motivated by the things *they* want to do, not the things you want 
them to do.

If you haven't done so already, read "How to Win Friends and Influence 
People" by Dale Carnegie.  It completely changed the way I view my 
interactions with people and I believe I've been a better security 
professional because of it.  That's my $0.02, but real change has to come 
from within.  ;-)

I'll second what Josh says above.

I've been too crazy busy to mention this before but I'm working on a
presentation with a developer friend to give at Agile Austin.  This from the
guy who heads one of the bigger breaker projects at OWASP.  And don't forget
QA people.  That's a huge audience and I've found QA people _very_ receptive
to information on security testing.

The truth is we have to engage developers, QA, other security professionals
and management if we're going to make this a better place for us and the
next generation like my kids.  We collectively setup the Internet as it is
today and its up to us to collectively mold it into the great and secure
place it should be.

And I think OWASP is the right place to bring all those parties together.

Cheers!

I'm really enjoying this conversation. The articles James used to start it
are great, especially since I've been closed up in my own little world for a
while and didn't really know what was going on in the OWASP community. I
also think the points made by each of the responses in this thread are solid
and have made me think about how we can all work together, especially in
Austin.

I think this issue that the OWASP community as a whole is dealing with is a
perpetual challenge and an important one for the InfoSec community at large.
In communicating the value of security and my services to customers in the
past, I've fallen into the trap of assuming I know the business or the work
or the software better than my target audience. Even if I did know more, the
lack of respect and humility in my language disconnected my audience
immediately. I became a critic at best and an adversary at worst, when what
I really wanted was to work together to build a shared vision and accomplish
a shared goal. I hope that I've grown from those experiences. Now, I'm
trying hard to craft my leadership in a style described thousands of years
ago... "A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is
done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves." - Lao Tzu

the SDLC.  When I wrote milspec avionics code in the ?80s we were required
to incorporate input validation into every function and design test cases
that exercised its limits.  Didn?t worry much about confidentiality, but
availability was critical because satellites are not iphones you can just
reboot.  Anyway, I took part in some great discussions at B-Sides and here?s
another forum that will be interesting.

the Marriott on 4th Street.

SecureSDLC - Austin

An (ISC)? Security Leadership Series
Tuesday, June 14, 2011

Member = FREE, Non-member = $99

Conference Highlights:

The  <https://www.isc2.org/gisws2011/Default.aspx> (ISC)? 2011 Global
Information Security Workforce Study ranked application vulnerabilities as
the number one  threat to information security professionals.  This
validates the critical need for building security throughout the entire
software lifecycle.

(ISC)? SecureSDLC  events arm software professionals with the latest tools
and information regarding application security.  It will address building
security in from the ground up, tackle what to consider when securing each
phase of the software lifecycle, and investigate how companies can create
their own software assurance program.

Software stakeholders will learn why application security is important to
not only the development team but the business as well because it could help
enhance organizations credibility and reduce the loss of revenue and
reputation due to a breach resulting from insecure software.  Attendees will
learn best practices and industry standards for how security should be built
into each phase.

Target Audience:

Attendees would be individuals that are involved in software development who
design, code, build, deploy and manage software. This would include software
stakeholders including software developers, project managers, architects,
programmers, and others involved in the software development lifecycle.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-austin] OWASP's engagement with developers in Austin

 

I'm really enjoying this conversation. The articles James used to start it
are great, especially since I've been closed up in my own little world for a
while and didn't really know what was going on in the OWASP community. I
also think the points made by each of the responses in this thread are solid
and have made me think about how we can all work together, especially in
Austin.

 

I think this issue that the OWASP community as a whole is dealing with is a
perpetual challenge and an important one for the InfoSec community at large.
In communicating the value of security and my services to customers in the
past, I've fallen into the trap of assuming I know the business or the work
or the software better than my target audience. Even if I did know more, the
lack of respect and humility in my language disconnected my audience
immediately. I became a critic at best and an adversary at worst, when what
I really wanted was to work together to build a shared vision and accomplish
a shared goal. I hope that I've grown from those experiences. Now, I'm
trying hard to craft my leadership in a style described thousands of years
ago... "A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is
done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves." - Lao Tzu

I'll second what Josh says above.

 

I've been too crazy busy to mention this before but I'm working on a
presentation with a developer friend to give at Agile Austin.  This from the
guy who heads one of the bigger breaker projects at OWASP.  And don't forget
QA people.  That's a huge audience and I've found QA people _very_ receptive
to information on security testing.

 

The truth is we have to engage developers, QA, other security professionals
and management if we're going to make this a better place for us and the
next generation like my kids.  We collectively setup the Internet as it is
today and its up to us to collectively mold it into the great and secure
place it should be.

 

And I think OWASP is the right place to bring all those parties together.

 

Cheers!

IMHO, OWASP is for everyone.  As our local chapter President, I've strived

developers.  Certainly not an easy thing to accomplish, but I think we've
struck a good balance. 

The notion that "Developers don't know <expletive deleted> about security"
is false on so many levels as are most generalizations.  Developers learn
what they are taught in school, what they garner through experience, and
what they seek out on their own.  As OWASP, it is our job to not only be the
place developers feel comfortable seeking out, but to also help to
evangelize security within the community and get developers more interested.
Messages like the one above, as Rich said, are divisive at best and
undermine OWASP's core mission of educating the masses on security. 

I'd like to put this out there for everyone in our Austin OWASP community.
Build bridges, not walls.  Make the developers your friends.  Put yourself
in the trenches with them and hold regular office hours.  Show enthusiasm
and let them know that security is FUN.  Remember that people are motivated
by the things *they* want to do, not the things you want them to do. 

If you haven't done so already, read "How to Win Friends and Influence
People" by Dale Carnegie.  It completely changed the way I view my
interactions with people and I believe I've been a better security
professional because of it.  That's my $0.02, but real change has to come
from within.  ;-)

Great articles. When there is an OWASP meeting that deals with the social
engineering necessary to bridge the gap between security people and
developers I'll be there to represent the developers.  
;-)

2011/2/22 Rich V?zquez <rich.vazquez at gmail.com> 
I think one interesting thing about both links is they accept the idea of a
"security person." Two blog entries and a series of comments where the
division is just accepted... 

It seems to accept developers aren't "security people," which is largely
true.  But the same could be said of managers, network engineers and many
others who haven't been educated specifically on security - or put it into
practice. Even building architects and construction teams don't always know
the basics of some physical security. So, who is a security person? 

A little speculation, but usually when there's an "us" and "them"
discussion, it probably means there's not a lot of "them" in the room. That
might be the problem for the larger OWASP community or the conference
environment this question came up in.

these articles concerning engagement with developers?

I send these not to get you worried about the future of OWASP, but more for
the Austin chapter to engage our localized development communities (Ruby,
ACUG, Python, ...).  We should use these articles as motivation to drive our
vision for the Austin chapter of OWASP.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
James

That event is free if you have a CISSP Number to plug in as your member
number, BTW.

At least that worked for me.

See you there if not sooner.

<p><strong>When:</strong> March 29, 2011, 11:30am - 1:00pm 
</p>
<p><strong>Topic: </strong> OWASP ROI: Optimize Security Spending Using OWASP
</p>
<p>Considering the current economic times, security spending is 
tighter than ever. This presentation will cover the Open Web Application
 Security Project (OWASP) projects and how they can improve your 
application security posture in a budget-friendly way. OWASP is an open 
community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and 
maintain applications that can be trusted. The OWASP Foundation is a 
not-for-profit entity and provides unbiased, practical, cost-effective 
information about application security. Projects covered include the 
OWASP Top 10, OWASP Testing Guide, Enterprise Security API (ESAPI), 
Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), Application Security 
Desk Reference (ASDR) and others. A case study of a specific company's 
success with implementing OWASP methodologies and tools will also be 
provided. In this case study the company realized annual reduction in 
spending of several hundred thousand dollars.
