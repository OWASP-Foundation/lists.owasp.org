Hello,

Wondering if anyone out there in OWASP land is interested in being a part 
of the CISSP study group that I am starting up next Tuesday?  The study 
group will meet in the same location as the OWASP meetings (National 
Instruments) from 6-9 PM every Tuesday for the next 11 weeks.  This will 
give us enough time to cover the 10 domains of security as well as a week 
for review prior to the CISSP exam here in Austin.  The tentative schedule 
is below.  Please e-mail me back if you would like to participate. Thanks!

About the Study Group: I am organizing this study group out of my 
interests in security and my desire to take the CISSP exam.  All of you 
have expressed an interest to me at one time or another in being a part of 
the study group or in obtaining your CISSP certification so you are 
receiving this invite.  Please let me know now if you are not willing to 
seriously contribute to the study group.  We will begin the study group on 
September 29, 2009 with an in-person meeting of all interested parties. 
Dean has graciously offered to lead the discussion on this date, but 
please make sure that you have read your text's section on "Access 
Control" prior to attending.  I will need each person to pick three 
domains that they would like to lead the discussions on.  These can be 
domains that you know everything about or nothing about.  It doesn't 
matter.  The goal is for us all to learn here.  Please send me your list 
of three domains ASAP and I will assign everyone 1-2 primary and 1-2 
alternate slots.  I will do my best to make sure that you get your desired 
section, but I can't guarantee anything.  Thanks.

Textbook: You are free to chose your own textbook.  I have a copy of Mike 
Meyers' CISSP(R) Certification Passport by Shon Harris that I will be 
using likely amongst other texts.  Everyone must have at least one 
textbook that they can bring with them to the study group.

Josh,

We completed our 6th internal CISSP study group session at Dell this
past Spring and were just discussing starting our 7th study group.

I'd like to join forces and have a few of my certified and my
non-certified people participate.

You may want to consider shortening the meeting from 3 hours and only
conducting a 1 hour per week meeting and including a conference bridge.
I'm willing to supply the bridge if people cannot attend in person, plus
most of us are very busy and can only focus/retain the material at most
in a 90 minute period once a week.

Also, we use Shon Harris' All-in-One CISSP Exam Guide 4th Edition
(includes a cdrom) and go through each chapter every week. We start on
chapter 3 (Risk Management) since the first 2 chapters are introductory.
The review book has 10 chapters of content and roughly takes us 12-14
weeks to complete (we've found 2-3 chapters take more than 1 session).

I hope this helps and completely flexible and supportive of this
community activity.

Thanks,

Phil Agcaoili, CISM, CISSP
Dell | Global Information Security Assurance & Consulting

*When:* September 29, 2009, 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Topic: * OWASP ROI: Optimize Security Spending using OWASP

Considering the current economic times, security spending is tighter than
ever. This presentation will cover the Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP) projects and how they can improve your application security posture
in a budget-friendly way. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling
organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications that can be
trusted. The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit entity and provides
unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security.
Projects covered include the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Testing Guide, Enterprise
Security API (ESAPI), Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS),
Application Security Desk Reference (ASDR) and others. A case study of a
specific company's success with implementing OWASP methodologies and tools
will also be provided. In this case study the company realized annual
reduction in spending of several hundred thousand dollars.

*Who:* Matt Tesauro

Matt Tesauro has worked in web application development and security since
2000. He has worn many different hats, from developer to DBA to System
Administrator to Penetration Tester. Matt also taught graduate and
undergraduate classes on web application development and XML at the Texas
A&M Mays Business School. Currently, he's focused on web application
security, developing a Secure SDLC and launching a two-year application

Today you have two options over lunch:

1. Left-over spaghetti at your desk listening to the person in the cubicle
next to you prattle on and on about some inane topic....

OR

2. Come to OWASP and hear Matt Tesauro give a kickin' presentation on OWASP
ROI and eat a really awesome cookie courtesy of National Instruments.  The
spaghetti will be there when you get back.

Best,
