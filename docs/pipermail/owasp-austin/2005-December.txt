To all the OWASP participants worldwide,

 

 As 2005 comes to an end I want thank you all for making OWASP a success!
With a growing membership and skyrocketing downloads we are making a real
difference in finding and fighting the causes of application security
vulnerabilities.

 

Through your hard work in 2005, OWASP has released a completely overhauled
Guide, powerful new features in WebScarab, and hosted two successful AppSec
conferences. Our downloads have more than doubled to over 16,000 every
month, our unique visitors have doubled to almost 35,000 every month, and
our bandwidth requirements have soared 600% to over 18GB per month.

 

Our New Jersey chapter has arranged for a Holiday discount for OWASP
participants.  From now through December 31st, get 30% off any books you
order through http://www.oreilly.com/buy. Just use Discount Code HOHOHO when
you place your order.

 

Have a wonderful Holiday season and best wishes for the New Year.

 

--Jeff
