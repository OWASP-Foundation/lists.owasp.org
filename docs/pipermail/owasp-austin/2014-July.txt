month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of

conversation.  (No chapter or organization membership is needed to attend.)

*OWASP monthly meeting on July 29th*

*When: *11:30AM to 1PM CST -- food socializing first, meeting starts around
11:45
*Location: *National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac Building C

*Title: Railsgoat*
Abstract: While working to secure rails applications in a truly Agile
development environment, it became clear that the Rails and Ruby ecosystem
needed attention from the security community in the form of free and open
training. RailsGoat is an attempt to bring attention to both the problems
that most frequently occur in Rails as well as solutions for remediation.
This talk will discuss Railsgoat, common issues, defensive measures, and
engage the audience for feedback/improvements.

*Speaker: *
*Ken Johnson *is the CTO of nVisium and leads the company's product
development efforts. Ken is obsessed with code security and code in general
but holds a special place in his heart for Ruby. Ken is passionate about
the open source community, and genuinely loves to create.

*Food: *Taco Deli! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough for all!

*Drawings*: Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways
that may take place!   Did you know who won the LASCON admission or any of
the other giveaways last month?
