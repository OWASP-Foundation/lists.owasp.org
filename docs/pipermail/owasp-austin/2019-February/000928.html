<PRE>We apologize to anyone who was wanting to view today&#8217;s OWASP Austin Chapter meeting via GoToWebinar.  Just before the meeting we discovered that the OWASP Foundation had deactivated the account.  Unfortunately we were not able to get in contact with anyone at the Foundation to assist. We will be working with them to get access to the new tool (Zoom) so that we can have that working before next month&#8217;s meeting.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting - February 26, 2019
 
[EXTERNAL EMAIL: Please use caution when opening links and attachments]

Hello everyone!
 
This is a reminder that this month's OWASP Austin Chapter monthly meeting is next week, Tuesday, February 26, 2019.
 
If you have not already done so, please register on Eventbrite so that we can be sure to order enough food for everyone.
 
OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for February
 
When: Tuesday, February 26th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM
 
Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C
 
Title: Angular for AppSec Professionals
 
One of the most popular web frameworks is Angular. While you don't need to become an expert in new JavaScript frameworks to be able to conduct successful assessments of Angular applications, knowing the fundamentals and building blocks of that framework can definitely give you an advantage during the initial phases of an application security assessment. This talk aims to introduce application security professionals to the basics of AngularJS and Angular applications from a security standpoint. We will also demonstrate how to dynamically debug Angular code from the browser console. This allows us to change the behavior on an application by manipulating  Angular components. With that knowledge in hand, we can start conducting a more in-depth analysis of Angular based applications.
 
Speaker: Alex Useche
 
Alex is an Application Security Consultant at nVisium and has over 12 years of experience in the IT industry as a software developer, security engineer, and penetration tester. As a software developer, he has worked with and architected mobile and web applications in a wide range of languages and frameworks, including Angular, .NET and Django. While his expertise is in application security, Alex also has experience conducting penetration tests of internal and external networks. In his previous position, Alex led several projects aimed at building secure coding and DevOps processes for a mid-sized consultancy agency, as well as automating security analysis tasks. Alex has a Bachelors in Information Technology and a Masters in Software Engineering. He has also conducted and published research on artificial intelligence technologies. Alex is actively working on developing security tools written in Go and participating in various bug bounties.
 
Food: Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have enough for all!

We will use GoToWebinar this month, but most likely will be using Zoom for next month's March meeting.
