Happy February everyone!


Last month we had a great turnout for our monthly meeting!  While there
were a few miscues :/, I have taken those as lessons-learned and will do my
best to ensure it goes more smoothly this next time.


This month's OWASP Austin Chapter meeting will be on Tuesday, February 23,
2016.  *Please RSVP on Eventbrite
<http://owasp-austin-2016-february.eventbrite.com> by noon on Friday,
February 19th,* so I can then place the order for the food.  I want to be
sure I have ordered enough food this time for everyone.


Following are the details of the meeting:


OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, February 23rd from 11:30
AM to 1:00 PM


*Rugged DevOps Using Gauntlt*


Writing code that works is hard. Writing rugged code that can stand the
test of time is even harder. This difficulty is often compounded by
crunched timelines and fast cycles that prioritize new features. Add in
evolving business needs and new technology and it becomes confusing to know
what to do and how to integrate security into your application.


This workshop brings in some of the top developers and application security
practitioners to help you ruggedize your end-to-end development lifecycle
from code commit to running system.


Three Takeaways:

   1. You will learn pragmatic approaches and tooling that will affect your
   development processes and delivery pipelines.
   2. Armed with tools and ideas for monitoring your operational and
   runtime security.
   3. You will walk away with code examples and tools that you can put into
   practice right away for security and rugged testing.

Bring a laptop (mac or linux) that you can install software on and a github
account.


*Speaker: *James Wickett (see bio at about.me/wickett)


*RSVP* ? http://owasp-austin-2016-february.eventbrite.com


*Food:* Taco Deli. Please RSVP so we can be sure to have enough for all!


Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!


*Location: *National Instruments, 11500 North Mopac Expressway, Building C,
Austin, TX 78759

*Other Reminders --*


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *


Just a reminder, this month's Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is *next
week, Thursday, February 18th*.  Normally it would have been this week, but
due to conflict with other planned events at Sherlock's, we had to change
it for this month.  Hopefully no one will show up tomorrow at Sherlock's
and looking for the rest of us. :)

*OWASP Study Group*

The OWASP Study Group continues to meet on Thursdays at the same location
and meeting room at NI from 12-1pm.  The current
<http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-2015-snapshot>
study
group
<http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/study-group-2015-snapshot>
is covering the book titled "*Snapshot - Reading and Treating People Right
the First Time*", and is close to completing it.  Discussions are already
underway for the next topic. If you are interested in knowing more or
contributing to that discussion, see the group discussion forum titled Future
Study Group Ideas (Ongoing Discussion Forum)
<http://myowasp.ning.com/groups/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/future-study-group-ideas-ongoing-discussion-forum>

*PROJECTS: Announcing GSoC 2016, New Releases from OWASP ZSC, ESAPI,
WebGoat 7, and a ZAP User Survey*

*Got an Idea for Google Summer of Code 2016?*

The time of the year has come to propose ideas for GSoC 2016.

We haven't been selected yet, but we need to populate this list of ideas as
part of the organization application process.

We have created a list here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSOC2016_Ideas
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/ee8980594b/f385211697/utm_content=&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eowasp%2Eorg%2Findex%2Ephp%2FGSOC2016_Ideas&utm_campaign=February%202016%20Community%20News%20Flash>

We have removed last year's ideas and only left some as "example ideas".
Please add more ideas to this list as you wish. You should put your ideas
down before the application deadline, ie before February 19th. You will be
able to add more idea after the deadline but we would like to present to
Google as many ideas as possible.

*OWASP ZSC*

We are preparing to start developing a powerful obfuscation tool OWASP ZSC
and looking for some volunteers to contribute the tool project.

OWASP ZSC Project
OWASP ZSC is an open source software in python language which lets you
generate customized shellcodes and convert scripts to an obfuscated script.
This software can be run on Windows/Linux/OSX under python.

Usage of shellcodes
Shellcodes are small codes in assembly which could be use as the payload in
software exploiting. Other usages are in malwares, bypassing anti viruses,
obfuscated codes and etc.

Usage of Obfuscate Codes
Can be use for bypassing antiviruses, code protections, same stuff etc?

Why use OWASP ZSC ?
According to other shellcode generators such as metasploit tools and etc,
OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect.
OWASP ZSC encoders are able to generate shellcodes with random encodes that
lets you to get thousands of new dynamic shellcodes with the same job in
just a second, it means you will not get a same code if you use random
encodes with same commands, and that makes OWASP ZSC one of the bests!
otherwise it's going to generate shellcodes for other operation systems in
the next versions. It?s the same story for the code obfuscation.

There are more details about how it works and user guides
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/ee8980594b/17d4d5d4ac>
and also how to develop
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/ee8980594b/1ffdcbd2f7>.

*WebGoat*

Webgoat v.7 released. Listen to our podcast
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/ee8980594b/83f302441d>
as Bruce Mayhew explains the new version. The WebGoat Project started 10
years ago and has had over 1,000,000 downloads. Version 7.0 is being
released this week. Matt Miller caught with Bruce Mayhew, project lead, to
talk about the history of the project, what has been updated in version 7,
and what he foresees as the future of this project. Project Page:

*New ESAPI Release*

ESAPI project co-leader, Kevin Wall announced his team has just tagged (and
signed) a new ESAPI release. The tag name is esapi-2.1.0.1. There are 36
GitHub issues that were closed. You can find full details at:
https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/master/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.1.0.1-release-notes.txt
.

Note that there are also some important changes made to the GitHub repo
itself. Specifically, we have chosen to adopt a git workflow based on this
blog: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/ee8980594b/dd7765f039>,
where all the new development work will be done on the 'develop' branch and
the 'master' branch will henceforth reflect the latest official ESAPI
release.

To accommodate this,

   - The 'develop' branch has now been made the DEFAULT branch.
   - The 'master' branch has now been made a PROTECTED branch.

Chris Schmidt will be uploading this to Maven sometime later this day,
probably once he's through with his day job. Lastly, a special shout-out to
Matt Seil and Jeremiah Stacey for their help with Git and some nasty JUnit
concurrency issues.

*EVENTS: Upcoming AppSec Events*

<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/ee8980594b/51bee3e7f2>

The European OWASP Conference is going to be one of the best ever.
Come to hear and share ideas with the experts!
27 June - 1 July 2016

Read the latest news on the next *OWASP AppSecEU* on the conference site:
http://2016.appsec.eu/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/ee8980594b/097d656140>

Important keynote speakers will be present at the Marriott Park Hotel in
Rome, Italy. Our special guest will be Charlie Miller, who will present the
keynote talk "Bugs ruin everything". In his speech, Miller will discuss
some popular methods for finding vulnerabilities and why it is so difficult
to spot them.

*Charlie Miller is a senior security engineer at Uber ATC, a hacker, and a
gentleman.* Back when he still had time to research, he was the first with
a public remote exploit for both the iPhone and the G1 Android phone. He is
a four-time winner of the CanSecWest Pwn2Own competition. He has authored
three information security books and holds a PhD from the University of
Notre Dame. He has hacked browsers, phones, cars, and batteries.

The *Open Web Application Security Project* is an open-source project for
application security. OWASP provides advice on the creation of secure
Internet applications and testing guides.

It boasts a strong global community with more than 45,000 participants,
more than 55 corporate members and 20 academic supporters through 249
active local chapters in 6 continents and 97 countries.

More than 800 people are expected at the event, with 3 days of training
followed by the 2-day conference that includes:

   - Five parallel talks with focus on the OWASP core mission (Dev, Ops,
   Hack, CISO and Research);
   - Keynotes from industry leaders;
   - Exhibition spaces that offer innovative solutions for the needs of
   companies.

Do not miss the opportunity to participate this important conference,
mentioned in Tripwire as a TOP 11 SECURITY CONFERENCE IN 2016
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/ee8980594b/d971013ace>
.

More details on registration, program and speakers will be sent in a
forthcoming communication.

is #10

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration
testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is
designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and
as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to
penetration testing. ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of
tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.

OWASP OWTF is a project focused on penetration testing efficiency and
alignment of security tests to security standards like: The OWASP Testing
Guide (v3 and v4), the OWASP Top 10, PTES and NIST.

#2 of our 2016 Strategic Goals
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/85a0945103/ec52f470ae/utm_content=OWASP&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=%232%20of%20our%202016%20Strategic%20Goals&utm_campaign=OWASP%20Foundation%20%7C%20February%202016%20Connector>
is to become more involved in the Developer community. We are pleased to
report tremendous turnout for our recent outreach events, Codemash in
chilly Ohio and AppSec California in sunny Santa Monica.

CodeMash
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/85a0945103/70123d48f3>
is a unique event that seeks to educate developers on current practices,
methodologies, and technology trends in a variety of platforms and
development languages such as Java, .NET, Ruby, Python and PHP.

A breakdown of this tremendous event:

   - 2500 attendees
   - 1000 kids
   - 202 speakers
   - 84 staff
   - 280 sessions


Sessions included 40 hours of security content, with 2 days of training by
Jim Manico and Bill Sempf.

OWASP Foundation participated as a Gold level sponsor. Bill Sempf, the
project leader of the OWASP .NET Project and chapter leader for OWASP
Columbus, served on the Session Committee helping to review over 1000
submissions. We have been proud to partner with Codemash over the past two
years and are seeking similar opportunities worldwide.

AppSec California
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/85a0945103/75715dbf94>
is a one of a kind experience for information security professionals,
developers, and QA and testing professionals, as they gather at the beach
from around the world to learn and share knowledge and experiences about
secure systems and secure development methodologies. The third annual event
taking place last month fulfilled all expectations bridging the local
application security and developer communities for a beautiful weekend on
the California coast.

*OWASP ZSC Project*

OWASP ZSC is an open source software in python language which lets you
generate customized shellcodes and convert scripts to an obfuscated script.
Shellcodes are small codes in assembly which could be use as the payload in
software exploiting. Other usages are in malwares, bypassing anti viruses,
obfuscated codes and etc. Obfuscate codes can be use for bypassing
antiviruses, code protections, same stuff, etc. This software can be run on
Windows/Linux/OSX under python.

Why use OWASP ZSC?
According to other shellcode generators such as metasploit tools and etc,
OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect.
OWASP ZSC encoders are able to generate shellcodes with random encodes that
lets you to get thousands of new dynamic shellcodes with the same job in
just a second, it means you will not get a same code if you use random
encodes with same commands, and that makes OWASP ZSC one of the bests!
otherwise it's going to generate shellcodes for other operation systems in
the next versions. It?s the same story for the code obfuscation.

*ESAPI*

ESAPI project co-leader, Kevin Wall announced his team has just tagged (and
signed) a new ESAPI release. The tag name is esapi-2.1.0.1. There are 36
GitHub issues that were closed. You can find full details at:

Note that there are also some important changes made to the GitHub repo
itself. Specifically, we have chosen to adopt a git workflow based on this
blog: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/85a0945103/d5ab6be60b>,
where all the new development work will be done on the 'develop' branch and
the 'master' branch will henceforth reflect the latest official ESAPI
release.

Hi Austin OWASP,

Our next study group topic has been chosen. We will be going through the OWASP Hacking Lab at https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html

We will be starting with the OWASP Top Ten challenge first. So, we will be learning about the mechanics of each vulnerability and how they are exploited.

These include:

1) SQL injection
2) Cross-site scripting (XSS)
3) Broken authentication & session management
4) Insecure direct object references
5) Cross site request forger (CSRF)
6) Security misconfiguration
7) Insecure cryptographic storage
8) Failure to restrict URL access
9) Insufficient transport layer protection
10) Unvalidated redirects & forwards.

Our first meeting on March 3 will be making sure everyone is reading to go, i.e. they have an account and can get connected to the labs.

People who want to participate will need to do the following:

1) Go to https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html and register an account
2) Go to security events and click "Register Now" for the OWASP Top Ten challenge
3) Go to the download section and select the download option you want. You can download a virtual machine (vmware, virtualbox) or a live CD iso. It is important to use one of their images because you will need to make a VPN connection to their labs in order to work on the challenges.

This should be a ton of fun!

Email me if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Matt Pardo
