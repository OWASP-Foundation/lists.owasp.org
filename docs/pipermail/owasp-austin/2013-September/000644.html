    Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, Sponsored by Sourcefire

*When:* Thursday, September 12th, 5pm-7pm

*Where:* Sherlocks Baker Street Pub and Grill, 183 &amp; Burnet (we meet in
the large room to the right as you walk in, normally on the far side of
the room.)

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of
the month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with
InfoSec or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good
food and conversation.

*Sponsor: Sourcefire* is a global leader in intelligent cybersecurity
solutions. Their next gen security platform is transforming the way
