Howdy Austin OWASPers!

What a great January we had as a chapter!  We started off the month with
one of the largest and best happy hours we have ever had the privilege to
host along with our sponsor Fishnet.  The chapter meeting last week was our
first CryptoParty that couldn't have gone better.  Nothing like meeting new
people and learning new ideas to start off 2015 right!  Come out to our
next events and join the fun!

OWASP Monthly Meeting -- next on February 24th!

Title: Static Analysis: Beyond the Basics

Static vulnerability analysis is the practice of testing non-running
software for application vulnerabilities. It is often referred to as SAST,
white box testing, or automated code review. In this session we will cover
some of the hows and whys of static analysis and deep dive some of the
common issues users of SAST technologies often encounter. Topics will
include data flow analysis and taint propagation, scan noise, and partial
code scanning, specifically around OWASP Top 10 issues. The material should
provide value to anyone with an interest in application security, not just
static analysis practitioners.

Speaker: Andy Earle

Andy Earle is a Security Solutions Architect for HP Enterprise Security
Products (ESP). Andy has spent 5 years designing and delivering application
security programs, technology, and services for US Federal and commercial
customers, specifically around HP's Fortify appsec products. Andy was
previously the product manager for a high assurance multi-level secure
operating system at BAE Systems, and Presales Engineer for various web
development and mobile security firms. Andy has spoken extensively on
application security topics, most recently at OWASP's SnowFROC 2013, the
RMISC conference, SANS AppSec 2013, and HP Protect. Early experience
includes software engineering, mobile application development, and
life-guarding at his neighborhood pool. Andy is a CISSP and CSSLP, and has
a B.S. in Systems Engineering from the University of Virginia.

Food: It will be a surprise! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough
for all!

Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. MOPAC Building C

Or if you can not attend we should be broadcasting the meeting GoToMeeting
