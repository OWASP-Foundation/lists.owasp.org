Hello everyone!

This email is to provide an update for this month's Austin Security
Professionals Happy Hour.  I had sent out the original notification that it
would be at Sherlock's, but due to them not having available space on that
date, we needed to move it to another location.  It will be at Mister
Tramps, which is just down the road from Sherlock's.

Here is the updated information:

*Where: *Mister Tramps Sports Pub and Cafe, 8565 Research Blvd, Austin TX
78758 (south-east corner of Hwy 183 and Ohlen Rd, just in front of the
Target store).  We have their large room reserved.

It will still be this Wednesday, May 3rd, from 5pm - 7pm.


Please contact me if any questions or concerns.


Thanks,

Hello everyone!

*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for May*

When: Tuesday, May 30th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Title: Annoying web app vulnerabilities: HTTP Request Smuggling, HTTP
Response Splitting and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Misconfigurations.

     Part 1:

Abstract: HTTP Request Smuggling is an attack capable of bypassing security
protections and "poisoning the well" for caching web proxies. In this talk
we'll be discussing attack scenarios and their security implications.

Speaker: Gabriel has been actively involved in the security industry since
2007 and currently holds the position of security analyst at Rapid7.


     Part 2:

Abstract: HTTP Response Splitting is a web application vulnerability that
is often misunderstood, but can lead to a serious compromise. This talk
will walk through the basics of Response Splitting, how an attack works,
and what you can do to defend against it.

Speaker: Ben Columbus is a security analyst for Rapid7, who specializes in
network and web application penetration testing. He has been working in
security for the last eight years in various positions and was previously a
penetration tester for the State of Texas.


     Part 3:

Abstract: The talk will provide information about headers used for
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and how servers use these headers to
communicate access policy to browsers. The possible security implications
of misconfigured CORS headers will be discussed.

Speaker: Jacob enjoys learning about security vulnerabilities and their
usage in the real world.


Food: Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have enough
for all!
