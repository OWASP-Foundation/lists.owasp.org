Hi everyone!

Lots of things going on that I wanted to let y'all know about.

--------------------------------------------------------------

*LASCON X - CFP and CFT now open!*


We want this year's LASCON, our 10th year anniversary, to be extra special,
and with that we want to attract some great speakers and training.


The *Call for Papers (CFP) *is now open. Visit our website -
https://lascon.org/cfp/ - to submit your talk.


The *Call for Training (CFT)* is also open.  Go to https://lascon.org/cft/
to submit your training proposal.


We have set a *deadline of April 14, 2019* for both CFP and CFP, so submit
yours today!

--------------------------------------------------------------

*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting - March 26, 2019*


Just a reminder that our March chapter meeting will be the last Tuesday of
this month, March 26th. H?ctor Quartino will be presenting on "*Browser
Hardening, Personal Security and Privacy Measures*".  If you have not
already done so, please RSVP so we have enough food ordered:

https://owasp-austin-2019-march.eventbrite.com


--------------------------------------------------------------

*BSides Austin*


This year BSides Austin is celebrating its 10th anniversary. In addition to
the two days of conference sessions and networking, they are adding:

   - Two days of *low-cost* training classes prior to the conference to
   provide deeper learning opportunities: *The BSides Austin Training Days
   run March 26-27*
   - The Mental Health Hackers Village, a resource room dedicated to
   educating information security professionals about the unique mental health
   risks faced by those in the field and providing guidance on reducing the
   effects of related mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, social
   isolation, and other mental health disorders



Tickets to the two-day conference (March 28-29) are still available, but
they wouldn?t suggest holding off much longer to buy yours. They have sold
out for the past three years, and why take chances?

Register for $35 at https://bsidesaustin.com/.



If you?re still on the fence, the program schedule is now live at
https://bsidesaustin.com/schedule/, and they think you?re going to love
this year?s lineup.



BSides Austin Training Days is comprised of six small-classroom infosec
courses that give you that deep-dive experience at prices set to make you
consider taking those two extra days off work! Read more and register at
https://bsidesaustin.com/bsides-austin-2019-training-days/.


--------------------------------------------------------------

*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour - we need your help*


As you may have noticed, we have not been able to maintain a consistent
monthly happy hour. This is mainly due to our struggles with finding
sponsors. If you happen to have any contacts with a company who is willing
to sponsor the happy hour, then please let us know.  We have some companies
who are willing to sponsor for later months, but right now we need to find
one who can sponsor for next week (Thursday, March 14th). Your help will be
greatly appreciated.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] OWASP Austin Chapter - switching to Google Groups
	for mailing list
Message-ID: <CAHU1Yu_VBfTkAav1ecDtzVi=g0BK_4qfujc4H61doMJEwizvqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

You may have already seen a message sent to this list about the Google
Groups. The current list is run on a software called Mailman, which is very
dated software and evidently has had lots of issues. So the Foundation is
going to move to Google Groups, which I think will work out well for our
needs.


Unfortunately the switchover will require each of you to take action to
join the Google Group.  It is not required for you to have a Google email
account, and the help document (listed below) can provide those
instructions.


All requests will come through me, at least initially, so I will approve
those as quickly as possible. Note that for our Austin Chapter Google
Group, it will be set up to only allow the chapter leadership to post
announcements, rather than be an interactive forum. We may open it up
later, but for now just want to keep it simple.

Here is the link you can use to submit your request
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/austin-chapter/join.

Additional help information can be viewed at
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA.


In this transition period, I will most likely post new announcements to
both the old list and the new Google Groups, so you may see some
duplication of messages.  Ideally that will be a test for you to ensure you
are getting the information from the new solution.

If you have any issues or concerns with the new Google Groups, please let
me know.

None of these links work on either of my Android phones,  which is where I
choose to process the 80 email messages I get per day.

If no one in this group can figure out how to setup a simple mail forwarded
without relying on a dying service layer then please remove me from this
list immediately.

For mobile you can simple send an email to
austin-chapter+subscribe at owasp.org and follow the instructions in the
reply. It's the list email address with "+subscribe" added on the end.

I assume your mobile OS will allow that email address above to be
'poke-able' so you can join the new group - it worked on my phone.

Cheers!

Hello everyone!


*This email will be the last announcement sent to the old OWASP Austin

As a reminder, the Google Groups list, at least for our chapter's purpose,
will only be used for sending event notifications and reminders like we
have done in the past. If for whatever reason you do not want to sign up,
then please know that our wiki page (https://austin.owasp.org) will always
have the upcoming events posted.
