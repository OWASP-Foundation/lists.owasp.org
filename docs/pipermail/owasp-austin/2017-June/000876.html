*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for June*

When: Tuesday, June 27th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Title: *Making Vulnerability Management Less Painful with OWASP DefectDojo*


DefectDojo was created in 2013 when one security engineer at Rackspace
stupidly opened his mouth in front of his leadership team. Vulnerability
management is traditionally tedious, time consuming, and mentally draining.
DefectDojo attempts to streamline vulnerability management with automation
centered around templating, report generation, metrics, scanner
consolidation, and baseline self-service tools. DefectDojo is currently
used by multiple large enterprises and has core contributors from five
different companies. It has made several engineers' lives much easier, and
it can help you too. Got a ton of findings to consolidate and report on?
DefectDojo has you covered. Need to have a dashboard of your team&#8217;s work?
DefectDojo has you covered. Tired of boilerplate report generation?
DefectDojo does that for you. Come check out how to make vulnerability
management less painful and speed up your appsec program in this talk with
demo.


*Speaker: *Greg Anderson


Greg Anderson is a security professional with diverse experience ranging
from vulnerability assessments to intrusion detection and root cause
analysis. His recent work has focused on advanced security automation to
get the most out of application security programs. Greg's previous work,
which was featured at DEFCON, focused on unconventional attack vectors and
how to maximize their impact while avoiding detection.


Greg is the creator of DefectDojo and was a Chapter Leader of OWASP San
Antonio for two years.


Feel free to chat him up about anything and everything.

*Food: *Tacodeli. PLEASE RSVP ahead of time so we can be sure to have
enough for all!

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event

local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

recruiting skilled technologists for project-oriented consulting and
contract positions. We&#8217;ve been firmly rooted in the Austin technology
community since 1999, and have been providing companies that develop,
build, and use technology with the people they need to grow their business
for over 15 years**.*
