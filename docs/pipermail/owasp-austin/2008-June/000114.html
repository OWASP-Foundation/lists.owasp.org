*Topic: * Securely Handling Sensitive Configuration Data.

One of the age old problems with web applications was keeping sensitive data
available on a need to know basis. The classic case of this is database
credentials. The application needs them to connect to the database but
developers shouldn't have direct access to the DB - particularly the
production DB. The presentation will discuss how we took on this specific
problem, our determination that this was a specific case of a more general
problem and how we solved that general problem. In our solution, sensitive
data is only available to the application and trusted 3rd parties (e.g.
DBAs). We will then cover our implementation of that solution in a .Net 2.0
environment and discuss some options for J2EE environments. So far, we used
our .Net solution successfully for database credentials and private
encryption keys used in XML-DSig. Sensitive data is only available to the
application and trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs).
