A.J.'s Bio:  A. J. Scotka Senior Software Quality Engineer, Texas
Education Agency

engineering process, verification and validation throughout the life

Topic:  Securely Handling Sensitive Configuration Data.
One of the age old problems with web applications was keeping sensitive
data available on a need to know basis.  The classic case of this is
database credentials.  The application needs them to connect to the
database but developers shouldn't have direct access to the DB -
particularly the production DB.  The presentation will discuss how we
took on this specific problem, our determination that this was a
specific case of a more general problem and how we solved that general
problem.  In our solution, sensitive data is only available to the
application and trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs).  We will then cover our
implementation of that solution in a .Net 2.0 environment and discuss
some options for J2EE environments.  So far, we used our .Net solution
successfully for database credentials and private encryption keys used
in XML-DSig.  Sensitive data is only available to the application and
trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs).
Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building C
