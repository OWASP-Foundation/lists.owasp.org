<PRE>Hey Austin OWASPers,

An important announcement from TRISC.  They've extended early-bird 
registration through July 8.  As I announced at yesterday's meeting, there 
will be no July OWASP meeting and I instead strongly encourage you all to 
take advantage of TRISC.  Wanna know a secret?

[BEGIN SECRET]

Shhhh....If you're not an OWASP member yet go to <A HREF="http://www.lascon.org">http://www.lascon.org</A> and 
register today for LASCON for only $125.  That includes a $50 OWASP 
membership.  Then go to <A HREF="http://www.trisc.org">http://www.trisc.org</A> and register for TRISC as an 
OWASP member.  Bam!  You're now an official OWASP member, can vote in the 
upcoming OWASP board elections (if you are a member by tomorrow), and you 
get an extra $100 off of your TRISC registration!  But you didn't hear it 
from me....

[/END SECRET]
