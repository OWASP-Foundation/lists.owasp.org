<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers!

Hopefully you all enjoyed James Flom's presentation on &quot;Why Ha.ckers.org 
Doesn't Get Hacked&quot;.  I thought it was pretty awesome to see the work that 
they've put into making their systems secure.  In case you weren't able to 
make it or would like a copy of the presentation to reference later on, 
I've received permission from James to post it on the Austin OWASP website 
in the Presentation Archives (
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin#tab=Presentation_Archives">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Austin#tab=Presentation_Archives</A>).

We began our first session of the OWASP WebGoat Study Group yesterday with 
a TON of people in attendance.  The table couldn't even fit everyone which 
is fantastic!  Ben gave us all an overview of some HTTP Basics and we 
talked about HTTP Response Splitting as well.  Fun stuff.  If you're 
interested in finding out more about the study group happening every 
Wednesday from 12-1 PM, please check out the &quot;Austin OWASP Study Group&quot; 
group on <A HREF="http://my.owasp.org.">http://my.owasp.org.</A>

It looks like the Penetration Testing with Metasploit Half-Day Seminar on 
June 17, 2011 was a big hit.  So much so that all 76 of the seats have 
been reserved and we even have over a dozen people on the waiting list. If 
you got a seat, congratulations, it was undoubtedly one of the hottest 
tickets in town and you won't be disappointed.  If you didn't, I've got 
good news for you.  If everything works out as planned, the OWASP 
Foundation will be sending us a couple of video cameras to use for this 
training.  The video will eventually get put online for everyone to be 
able to learn from.  Also, because of the tremendous success of this first 
event, we will look into doing similar types of events in the future.  If 
you have ideas on topics that you would like to see, please post them in 
the forums for the &quot;Austin OWASP&quot; group on <A HREF="http://my.owasp.org.">http://my.owasp.org.</A>

Even if you didn't get a ticket to attend the half-day, we still want you 
to come to the Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour from 5 - 7 PM over 
at Sherlocks afterward.  The event is sponsored by Rapid7, the current 
owner of Metasploit and I'm pretty sure that Raphael Mudge will be hanging 
out there with us.  If you plan on attending, we'd appreciate it if you'd 
RSVP at <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/s/4wXb.">http://www.eventbrite.com/s/4wXb.</A>  Thank you!
