<PRE>Attention!  Lunch for the June Austin OWASP meeting will be sponsored by 
LASCON!  Please RSVP!

When: June 28, 2011, 11:30am - 1:00pm 
Topic: Introduction to the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference 
Guide

The OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide is a technology 
agnostic set of general software security coding practices, in a 
comprehensive checklist format, that can be integrated into the 
development life-cycle. At only 17 pages long, it is easy to read and 
digest.
The focus is on secure coding requirements, rather than on vulnerabilities 
and exploits. In this respect it is targeted more precisely for the 
development community, as opposed to the security community. 
This presentation will introduce this OWASP project and discuss some of 
the core concepts and principles of the requirements.
Who: Keith Turpin (Boeing) 

Keith leads Boeing&#8217;s enterprise application security assessment team. He 
previously served as the lead IT security advisor for all of Boeing&#8217;s 
international operations. 
Keith represents Boeing on the International Committee for Information 
Technology Standard's cyber security technical committee and serves as a 
U.S. delegate to the International Standards Organization's sub-committee 
on cyber security.
Keith is the project leader for the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick 
Reference Guide and is a member of the OWASP Global Projects Committee. He 
also spent four years as the Director of Communication for the Seattle 
chapter of the Information Systems Security Association.  
He is a frequent speaker at conferences, professional organizations and 
corporations on a variety of security topics.   
Keith holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering and MS in Computer Systems.
Where: National Instruments, 11500 N Mopac, Building C which is the 
tallest building on campus (8 levels). There will be signs posted in the 
lobby to direct you where to go and the receptionists will be able to 
assist you as well. See directions to National Instruments. 
Cost: Always Free
RSVP on Eventbrite 

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
