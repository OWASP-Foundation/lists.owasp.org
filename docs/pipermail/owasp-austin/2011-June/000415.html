<PRE>Hey Austin OWASPers!

Speak at LASCON
Just a quick note that we are still looking for CFP submissions for the 
2011 Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON).  This year we are 
specifically looking for people to speak on topics including Auditing, 
Architecture, Development, Executive Management, OWASP, and various 
security tools.  If you have expertise on any of these topics, we'd love 
to see a submission from you.  The direct link for LASCON CFP submissions 
is:

<A HREF="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lascon2011</A>

Everyone who speaks at LASCON gets a FREE pass to the conference, a 
limited-edition speakers only T-shirt, and a gift certificate for the 
OWASP store at the conference.  It's an excellent way to get your name out 
there and give back to the security community at the same time.  The 
submission deadline for LASCON CFP's is July 15th.

Attend LASCON
If you're not interested in speaking at LASCON, you should definitely plan 
on attending on October 28, 2011.  We've already received commitments from 
some of the industry's top security professionals.  Jeremiah Grossman, Joe 
Jarzombek, and John Steven are just a handful of the names that will be 
presenting at LASCON this year.  Registration is only $75 for OWASP 
members and $125 for non-members ($50 membership included) through July 
31.  After that date the prices will go up another $50.  To register, go 
to:

<A HREF="https://www.regonline.com/lascon2011">https://www.regonline.com/lascon2011</A>

No other conference gives you more bang for your buck than LASCON. 
Register today and save on talks from the security industry's top 
presenters and this year's best networking opportunity.  And please plan 
to stick around for the Happy Hour afterward sponsored by Trustwave.  The 
mechanical bull is back!

Sincerely,
