<PRE>A couple of interesting job opportunities have come across my e-mail 
lately if anyone is interested:

1) Atsec information security is looking to hire an experienced 
information security professional for a full time application security 
evaluation position.  I'm not sure what all that entails, but if it sounds 
interesting you should contact Auston Hold at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">holt at austonhold.com.</A>

2) Zeb Blalock contacted me about an opportunity with Amazon in Seattle 
for a Senior Security Engineer focusing on application security.  If you 
enjoy analyzing the security of applications and services, discovering and 
addressing security issues and quickly reacting to new threat scenarios, 
this position would provide you with a challenging opportunity.  You would 
participate in security audits, risk analysis, vulnerability testing and 
security reviews across all elements of Amazon.com's software systems.  If 
this sounds interesting to you, then you can contact Zeb at (206) 266-9846 
or <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">zebb at amazon.com</A> to find out more information.

Hope you all enjoyed today's OWASP meeting.  I counted 57 people there. 
Sorry we ran out of food, but we had far less than that RSVP and haven't 
run out with those numbers in the past.  I'll order more for next time. 
Take care!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
President
