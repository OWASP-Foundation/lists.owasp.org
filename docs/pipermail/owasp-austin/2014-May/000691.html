<PRE>Hello Austin OWASPers!

Is it summer in Austin already?  How time flies when you are baking in the
heat.  Instead of enjoying the heat, come inside and enjoy the events we
have planned for this month.

-------
Austin Security Professional Happy Hour -- sponsored by The Broadleaf Group
When: Thursday May 8th from 5 - 7 PM

Where: Sherlocks Baker Street Pub and Grill, 183 &amp; Burnet (we meet in the
large room to the right as you walk in, normally on the far side of the
room.)

What: The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the Austin OWASP and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and
sponsored by various companies. We try to meet every second Thursday of the
month from January to September (but occasionally we make schedule
adjustments when needed). The event is an informal social gathering of
local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

Sponsor: The Broadleaf Group

with specific emphasis on providing Systems, Security, Unified
Communications, Managed IT, Banking and CIO level consulting for SMB to

-------
OWASP Monthly meeting on May 27th
11:30 - 1 (really 11:45 - 1, we gotta eat sometime)

Title: How to Use Crowd-Sourced Threat Intelligence

Abstract: This talk will include an overview and demo of the Open Threat
Exchange (OTX) and describe some of its information sources, including
anonymous sharing from Open Source Security Information Management (OSSIM.)
Jaime will share some of his experiences using OTX as a security
researcher. He will also provide his thoughts on how OWASP members can
benefit from security research and threat intelligence to &quot;build in&quot;
security rather than constantly reacting.

Speaker: Jaime Blasco is a Security Researcher with broad experience in
network security and malware analysis. At AlienVault, Jaime manages the Lab
and runs the Vulnerability Research Team in charge of researching and
integrating threat intelligence into detection mechanisms.

Food: Taco Deli time! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have enough for all!
Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any drawings/giveaways that may
take place!

Location: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C
