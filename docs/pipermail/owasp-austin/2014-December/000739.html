<PRE>Howdy Austin OWASPers!

We are still here, just doing our early winter sleep and recovery from
LASCON... But activities are still happening and we are ramping-up for next
year!

is available at <A HREF="http://vimeo.com/channels/848275">http://vimeo.com/channels/848275</A>

What: The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event

local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec
or even if you have an interest, come on out for drinks, good food and
conversation.

Sponsor:   FishNet Security

OWASP Monthly Meeting -- next on January 27th!

CryptoParty!

In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'
where he stated &quot;We are creating a world that all may enter without
privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or
station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may
express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being
coerced into silence or conformity.&quot; The Internet of today is an amazing
place of knowledge and opportunity, but it unfortunately falls short of Mr.
Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free to
to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to privacy
and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.
CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these
solutions to give us all the means with which to assert our right to
privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies like TOR,
full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are free to attend,
public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 27, 2015 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first ever
CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning about
the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to privacy. We
encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers to attend this
event. Presentations will be laid out so that novice and experienced alike
can take action based on the data presented. All tools presented will be
free and open source. Our CryptoParty will end with the first-ever OWASP
Austin Key Signing Party. Don't miss this meeting and be sure to invite
your friends!

Speaker: Several ! -- Lead by Josh Sokol

RSVP -- <A HREF="https://owasp-austin-2015-january.eventbrite.com">https://owasp-austin-2015-january.eventbrite.com</A>

FYI -- the CHFI training mentioned in the last months newsletter has been
moved by Austin ISSA to February --

Austin ISSA - Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator (CHFI) Training
February 9-13 @ Norris Conference Center in Austin

Come learn the essential hands-on skills needed to take your security game
to the next level. Whether you&#8217;re part of an incident response team or
investigating a computer crime, you need to figure out what they did, what
they changed and what they deleted so you can determine the best path. You
will learn how hackers and malicious users hide data, delete data and
attempt to hide their tracks. You will learn how to uncover what they have
deleted and how to follow the trail they left behind. You will also learn
how to be a first responder at a computer crime scene, how to handle
evidence, duplicate disks, investigate wireless attacks, investigate web
attacks, do mobile forensics and a myriad of other key skills.

Austin ISSA invites you to take the CHFI training the week of February 9th
- at the Norris Conference Center. This course normally costs $3000, but we
are offering it to ISSA members for only $1150! The course includes a
voucher for the CHFI certification (worth $500) and access to online labs
so you can practice the hands-on skills you learned. Class enrollment is
limited, so sign up &lt;<A HREF="http://austin-chfi.eventbrite.com/">http://austin-chfi.eventbrite.com/</A>&gt; early because it&#8217;s
expected to sell out.
