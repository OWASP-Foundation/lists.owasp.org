<PRE>Hey Austin OWASPers!

I think that most of you know me by now, but for those who are new, I've
been involved with our chapter in one way or another for almost 7 years.
I've been our Vice President, our President, the Co-Chair of LASCON, the
Co-Chair of AppSecUSA, and our liaison with almost all interactions between
our chapter and the OWASP Foundation.  What you may not know is that I am
one of the candidates running this year for the OWASP Board of Directors.
Lately, I've been kind of put off by some of the decision that the Board
has made regarding chapters, their funding sources, and their view of how
we fit into the organization.  I've been fairly vocal about it in the OWASP
circles, but as the saying goes....put up or shut up.  If I win, my goal is
to ensure that chapters, like OWASP Austin, have the resources and guidance
that they need in order to thrive and innovate.  If you are an OWASP member
(all attendees for AppSec last year should be), then you should have
received an e-mail from <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">owasp at simplyvoting.com</A> with a link to your ballot.
Information about myself and all of the other candidates can be found here:

Please consider selecting my name as one of your (up to four) options.
Thank you!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
