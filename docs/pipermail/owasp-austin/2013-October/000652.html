<PRE>Hey ho guys,

it was cool to meet you all last year and chat with many of you at one
of the best AppSecs in Austin, ever. Amazing talks and great
organisation teams! Thanks again for that! (and forgive me for saying
&quot;one of the best&quot; and not &quot;the mighty one and only best&quot;, but as a
German, I also have to hold up the flag for the AppSecEU in Germany this
July which was quite cool, too... *hehe*  ;-)  ) 

Second to Josh, I like to ask for your consideration for your second vote.

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.
We have a great community and this year many great candidates
volunteered for the board. A good sign how much people care and that our
community is very much alive and engaged. This time your voting is also
combined with the WASPY awards and a discussion on how we as OWASP want
to handle project sponsorship/branding. So your vote is even more
important. ;-)

For those of you who haven't met me last year, a quick intro: Since the
first time I joined OWASP many years ago, I feel very passionate about
our mission and our goals for an open community to advance web and
application security globally. In the past that has inspired me to help
with some ground work here and there, helping for the Germany and London
chapters, working for some of our awesome projects, but not so much
seeking a board election. However, in the last year, there were a few
board decisions and activities, where I felt they were executed not in
the best way for our community. And as a consequence, I gave myself the
challenge to either shut up and accept things as they are or to spend
the time and make the effort and try to do it better. So am now trying
the latter and volunteering for the board and hope some of my points
resonate with you and maybe gain your supporting vote.

Three main things I like to do:
(you can read the details here
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/images/7/71/Tobias_Gondrom.pdf">https://www.owasp.org/images/7/71/Tobias_Gondrom.pdf</A>)
1. First and foremost I want to re-energise our spirit and culture of an
open community.
2. Increase our reach out to developers and industry.
3. Governance and empower the community to make decisions directly as
much as possible.
The more you share power the saver it is. So I want to empower and
involve the community in general and via chapters and projects much more
in all major decisions and share as much information as possible as
early as possible. The board is a steward serving the community, not
it's master. Let's empower the community together, so that everyone can
participate in OWASP as an open, fair and welcoming home to all
contributors.

And here a link to some more info about the bio of all the candidates
and mine:

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.

Cheers, thanks a lot for your time and all your contributions and
looking forward to seeing you again in this great and amazing community,

Tobias
