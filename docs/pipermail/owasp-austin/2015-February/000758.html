<PRE>Howdy Austin OWASPers!

Just a quick reminder that we have moved the date of the Happy Hour from
the usual 2nd Thursday (this week) to the 3rd Thursday (next week).  So we
will not be meeting for sponsored Happy Hour this week, but we will be
meeting on 2/19!

And not previously announced, but Qualys is providing a give-away!  Bring
your business cards for the drawing!
