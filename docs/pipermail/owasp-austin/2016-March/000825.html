OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, March 29th from 11:30 AM
to 1:00 PM


*Lean Security*


Moving fast is a business imperative that you can&#8217;t afford to be in
opposition to. Lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery philosophies hinge on
the ability to move fast through collaboration, automation, and aligning
with the flow of the organization. Security needs to be able to make the
same transformation.


As a concrete example of applying these approaches to security, we will
show how a platform automation approach to security increases transparency
and visibility throughout the organization and pairs with the
high-throughput philosophies of DevOps and Continuous Delivery, while
working with the way the business functions and not against it.


&gt;<i>From this session, you will:
</I>
   - Understand the Lean, Agile, and DevOps techniques emerging in
   organizations today
   - Be armed with organizational strategies for bridging devops and
   security
   - Apply Lean thinking to security operations.

*Speaker: *Ernest Mueller


Ernest Mueller is a 20-year IT veteran who has led a variety of teams
designing, building and operating SaaS and Web products for companies large
and small. Frequently, that has involved innovating Agile, DevOps, and
cloud transformations to meet the needs of the modern marketplace. He
writes about these topics at theagileadmin.com. Ernest is also active in
advocating for the Austin technologist community, and organizes events like
DevOpsDays Austin and user groups like CloudAustin. As Lean Systems Manager
for AlienVault, he focuses on empowering the technical teams and creating a
high velocity path to deliver value to customers. Ernest resides in Austin,
TX with his daughter Aoife.
