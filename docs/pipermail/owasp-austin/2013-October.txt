There may have already been a note that's gone out so if I missed that and
I'm sending this a second time, I apologize.  In any case, I wanted to
quickly remind everyone that the "Web Application Defender's Cookbook"
study group starts today (Wed Oct 2) from 12-1 PM at the National
Instruments, Building A (smallest 2-story building on campus).  Today will
mostly just be looking at the book and trying to assign out some of the
first chapters so if you cannot make it, there is still plenty of time to
get your book ordered and start reading before next Wednesday's meeting.

A little bit about this book....it goes through various types of web-based
application attacks and then talks about how to defend against them using
the free and open source ModSecurity Apache module.  If you have web apps
and use Apache, then this is an excellent way to help defend against these
attacks without actually purchasing a WAF.  Come and learn about
ModSecurity with the group!

I wanted to remind anyone interested in joining us that the Web Application
Defender's Cookbook Study Group will be meeting tomorrow (Wednesday,
October 9) from 12-1 PM in Building A on the National Instruments campus in
room 217.  This is the same room that we have used for most of the past
study groups.  Once again, we will be using the MyOWASP site to coordinate
the group:

http://myowasp.ning.com/group/austinowaspstudygroup/forum/topics/study-group-web-application-defender-s-cookbook-modsecurity

In our first meeting last week we did a review of the way that the book is
laid out and set forth a plan to cover it.  For tomorrow's meeting,
attendees will be expected to have downloaded version 1.1.1 of the OWASP
Broken Web Applications project VM image.  Once downloaded, go ahead and
get it running in your VM of choice (Parallels, Virtualbox, or VMWare).
Hopefully everyone will have a chance to read chapter 1 (65 pages), but I
expect that much of our efforts for this next meeting will be in getting
everyone up and running on their VMs and maybe poking around there a little
bit.  Send me an e-mail if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol

Hey Austin OWASPers!

I think that most of you know me by now, but for those who are new, I've
been involved with our chapter in one way or another for almost 7 years.
I've been our Vice President, our President, the Co-Chair of LASCON, the
Co-Chair of AppSecUSA, and our liaison with almost all interactions between
our chapter and the OWASP Foundation.  What you may not know is that I am
one of the candidates running this year for the OWASP Board of Directors.
Lately, I've been kind of put off by some of the decision that the Board
has made regarding chapters, their funding sources, and their view of how
we fit into the organization.  I've been fairly vocal about it in the OWASP
circles, but as the saying goes....put up or shut up.  If I win, my goal is
to ensure that chapters, like OWASP Austin, have the resources and guidance
that they need in order to thrive and innovate.  If you are an OWASP member
(all attendees for AppSec last year should be), then you should have
received an e-mail from owasp at simplyvoting.com with a link to your ballot.
Information about myself and all of the other candidates can be found here:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2013_Board_Elections#2013_Board_Candidates

Please consider selecting my name as one of your (up to four) options.
Thank you!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol

Hey ho guys,

it was cool to meet you all last year and chat with many of you at one
of the best AppSecs in Austin, ever. Amazing talks and great
organisation teams! Thanks again for that! (and forgive me for saying
"one of the best" and not "the mighty one and only best", but as a
German, I also have to hold up the flag for the AppSecEU in Germany this
July which was quite cool, too... *hehe*  ;-)  ) 

Second to Josh, I like to ask for your consideration for your second vote.

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.
We have a great community and this year many great candidates
volunteered for the board. A good sign how much people care and that our
community is very much alive and engaged. This time your voting is also
combined with the WASPY awards and a discussion on how we as OWASP want
to handle project sponsorship/branding. So your vote is even more
important. ;-)

For those of you who haven't met me last year, a quick intro: Since the
first time I joined OWASP many years ago, I feel very passionate about
our mission and our goals for an open community to advance web and
application security globally. In the past that has inspired me to help
with some ground work here and there, helping for the Germany and London
chapters, working for some of our awesome projects, but not so much
seeking a board election. However, in the last year, there were a few
board decisions and activities, where I felt they were executed not in
the best way for our community. And as a consequence, I gave myself the
challenge to either shut up and accept things as they are or to spend
the time and make the effort and try to do it better. So am now trying
the latter and volunteering for the board and hope some of my points
resonate with you and maybe gain your supporting vote.

Three main things I like to do:
(you can read the details here
https://www.owasp.org/images/7/71/Tobias_Gondrom.pdf)
1. First and foremost I want to re-energise our spirit and culture of an
open community.
2. Increase our reach out to developers and industry.
3. Governance and empower the community to make decisions directly as
much as possible.
The more you share power the saver it is. So I want to empower and
involve the community in general and via chapters and projects much more
in all major decisions and share as much information as possible as
early as possible. The board is a steward serving the community, not
it's master. Let's empower the community together, so that everyone can
participate in OWASP as an open, fair and welcoming home to all
contributors.

And here a link to some more info about the bio of all the candidates
and mine:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2013_Board_Elections#Tobias_Gondrom

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.

Cheers, thanks a lot for your time and all your contributions and
looking forward to seeing you again in this great and amazing community,

Tobias

Good evening OWASP Austin chapter fellows,

it was so cool to meet many of you during my last visit at the last
LASCON/AppSecUS.

probably now enjoying some cool talks and nice beer later in the evening
at LASCON.

Just FYI: the global OWASP election period began last week and *will run
until tomorrow, Friday Oct-25 23:59CST.* The registered members upon you
