*Austin OWASPers

It is good to be back for 2013! We are in the process of planning an 
exciting year, with a docket of amazing speakers, training, happy hours 
and LASCON! If you want to be more involved with OWASP, please let me 
know. Believe me, we can find a place for you!

We are especially looking for volunteers to begin planning LASCON 2013. 
We are going to arrange a planning meeting soon.

****************************

*January Austin Security Professions Happy Hour*

OWASP and ISSA are still "cooking" this event and we've pushed it back 
to January 17th, next Thursday to finalize the details. If you represent 
a company that would like to sponsor Happy Hours, contact either me or 
Matt Snider (Matthew.Snider at phbvpartners.com).

When: January 17th

Where: Sherlocks at 183 and Burnet

RSVP: Coming soon.

**********************************

*January OWASP Chapter Meeting - "**Data events, or why security is 
cloudier than you think" - Wendy Nather
*

*
*

*When:* January 29th from 11:30a - 1:00p

*Who:* Wendy Nather

Wendy Nather is Research Director of the 451 Research Enterprise 
Security Practice. With over 20 years of IT experience, she built and 
managed the IT security program at the Texas Education Agency, where she 
directed multimillion-dollar initiatives for a statewide external user 
base of over 50,000. She also provided security guidance for the 
datacenter consolidation of 27 Texas state agencies.

Wendy previously worked in various roles in the investment banking 
division of Swiss Bank Corp (now UBS). Based in Chicago, Zurich and 
London, she also served as the first IT Security Director for the EMEA 
region. She has spoken at various industry conferences in the US and 
abroad, and co-authored The Cloud Security Rules. She was also named one 
of Tripwire Inc.'s "Top 25 Influencers in Security."


*Topic:* Data events, or why security is cloudier than you think.

*Abstract:* Data security doesn't involve just securing data at rest or 
in transit. It also needs to be secured in use ? which means that at any 
point, the characteristics of the data can change. We call this 
situation a "data event," and it can mean that security requirements 
have to change as a result.

This is not the same thing as logging event data; this is taking into 
account changes in the combination, use or business context surrounding 
specific data. For example, a press release is confidential and requires 
a certain set of security policies in the areas of access control, DLP, 
key management (if encryption is involved), and so on. But once the 
business event occurs, the press release suddenly becomes the opposite 
of confidential, and all the policies have to change immediately as a 
result.

Data events can also occur when data elements are combined in particular 
ways so that they become covered by regulations. A query might produce a 
small enough sample size that it needs to be treated as protected 
information, or a doctor becomes a patient so that her name is now 
protected by HIPAA. Data events are often tied closely to the business 
context, and as such can mirror transactions and workflows.

Data events are important because traditional security policies have 
been applied to the current container of the data: this database is 
confidential because some rows are confidential, or this Word document 
requires access control (but its content can be copied and pasted 
somewhere else). Container-centric security is too static for today's 
high-speed, big-data, cloud-based (pick as many buzzwords as you like) 
processing.

This talk will describe the concept of data events, and will invite 
audience discussion on how security controls can be adapted to them.


*Food:* Oh yeah, Taco Deli time! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have 
enough for all! Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any 
drawings/giveaways that may take place!


*Location:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*

*OWASP Study Group*

We meet every Wednesday from 12:00p-1:00p at National Instruments 
Building A on the second floor in one of the large conference rooms. 
Paul Griffiths, our Vice President, has been guiding these meetings. We 
will send out a separate announcement regarding the current topic, but 
we are starting up again tomorrow! It's a great networking opportunity 
and you just might learn something in the process and teach others as well!

From mark.major at owasp.org  Tue Jan 15 20:10:58 2013
From: mark.major at owasp.org (Mark Major)
Date: Tue, 15 Jan 2013 13:10:58 -0700
Subject: [Owasp-austin] Call for Presentations: SnowFROC 2013 cybersecurity
 conference (Denver, CO)
Message-ID: <CAFSbxesaUfJj7KtkZSEL_OiUcC+D89JhMum+5U_qby+8QHrPbQ@mail.gmail.com>

*=== FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION ===*
(Please redistribute this announcement to colleagues and peers as
appropriate.)

The Colorado OWASP <https://www.owasp.org> chapters are pleased to announce
that the 5th annual Front Range OWASP Conference
(SnowFROC<http://www.snowfroc.com>)
will occur on Thursday, March 28, 2013 in Denver, Colorado, USA.

Effective immediately, the SnowFROC planning committee is accepting
proposals for presentations on topics surrounding cyber security and web
application development and operations.


*Criteria and Submission*
Potential speakers may submit abstracts of proposed presentations to
https://dev.aerstone.com/snowfroc/cfp.

The submission tool will format newly-created abstracts automatically, but
all uploaded materials must adhere to the following requirements:

   - Only Microsoft Word documents, PDFs, rich-text format documents, and
   text files will be accepted.
   - Author names, affiliations, email addresses, and other
   personally-identifiable information must be stripped from uploaded
   documents.
   - Presentations must contain a title at the top of the document.
   - Presentation overviews should not exceed 300 words.

Presenters will be allotted 45-minute time slots. One abstract must be
submitted for each presentation considered. All abstracts must be written
in English.


*Evaluation*
The following criteria will determine abstract rankings:

   - Applicability to the requested topics (see below)
   - Relevance to web application development and operations
   - Relevance to the cybersecurity Industry at large
   - Relevance to the OWASP foundation
   - Strength of presentation (as determined by the review committee)
   - Timeliness of submission

Submitted abstracts will be assessed by selected members of the Colorado
OWASP chapters. All reviews will be blind and reviewers will not have
visibility to author information.


*Dates and Deadlines*
Abstract collection begins immediately and will continue until all speaking
slots are filled. Rolling evaluations will occur with selected papers
announced each Monday beginning on February 11th. Although the rolling
format extends the submission period significantly, potential speakers are
advised to submit as early as possible in order to maximize chances for
selection.

Final presentations of accepted abstracts must be submitted for review by
March 17th. Templates and other presentation formatting constraints will be
made available to selected speakers directly.

All accepted presentations will be delivered during conference proceedings
on March 28th, 2013.


*Legalities*
All speakers must agree with and abide by the OWASP Speaker Agreement
v2.0<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement>
.

*Anyone who cannot or will not abide by these terms will not be permitted
to present at the conference.*

In addition, presenters must agree to allow use of abstract titles, text,
and speaker names and bios for conference promotion. With speaker consent,
presentation materials will be distributed to conference attendees and will
be archived for future reference. With speaker consent, presentations will
be recorded and archived.


*Preferred Topics*
SnowFROC 2013 is a multi-track conference emphasizing a breadth of
information and skills. Conference organizers are actively seeking
presentations aligning with the following tracks and topics:

*High-level technical track*

   - Web application security testing, especially targeting large and
   complex enterprise applications

*Management track*

   - Web application security management (scope, boundaries,
   responsibilities, legal considerations, etc.)
   - Emerging threats
   - Planning and managing secure software development life cycles
   - Metrics for managing application security
   - Business risks associated with application security


*Legal track*

   - Liability related to web application security

January OWASP Chapter Meeting - "**Data events, or why security is
cloudier than you think" - Wendy Nather
*

*
*

*When:* This Tuesday, January 29th from 11:30a - 1:00p

*Who:* Wendy Nather

Wendy Nather is Research Director of the 451 Research Enterprise
Security Practice. With over 20 years of IT experience, she built and
managed the IT security program at the Texas Education Agency, where she
directed multimillion-dollar initiatives for a statewide external user
base of over 50,000. She also provided security guidance for the
datacenter consolidation of 27 Texas state agencies.

Wendy previously worked in various roles in the investment banking
division of Swiss Bank Corp (now UBS). Based in Chicago, Zurich and
London, she also served as the first IT Security Director for the EMEA
region. She has spoken at various industry conferences in the US and
abroad, and co-authored The Cloud Security Rules. She was also named one
of Tripwire Inc.'s "Top 25 Influencers in Security."


*Topic:* Data events, or why security is cloudier than you think.

*Abstract:* Data security doesn't involve just securing data at rest or
in transit. It also needs to be secured in use ? which means that at any
point, the characteristics of the data can change. We call this
situation a "data event," and it can mean that security requirements
have to change as a result.

This is not the same thing as logging event data; this is taking into
account changes in the combination, use or business context surrounding
specific data. For example, a press release is confidential and requires
a certain set of security policies in the areas of access control, DLP,
key management (if encryption is involved), and so on. But once the
business event occurs, the press release suddenly becomes the opposite
of confidential, and all the policies have to change immediately as a
result.

Data events can also occur when data elements are combined in particular
ways so that they become covered by regulations. A query might produce a
small enough sample size that it needs to be treated as protected
information, or a doctor becomes a patient so that her name is now
protected by HIPAA. Data events are often tied closely to the business
context, and as such can mirror transactions and workflows.

Data events are important because traditional security policies have
been applied to the current container of the data: this database is
confidential because some rows are confidential, or this Word document
requires access control (but its content can be copied and pasted
somewhere else). Container-centric security is too static for today's
high-speed, big-data, cloud-based (pick as many buzzwords as you like)
processing.

This talk will describe the concept of data events, and will invite
audience discussion on how security controls can be adapted to them.


*Food:* Oh yeah, Taco Deli time! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have
enough for all! Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any
drawings/giveaways that may take place!


*Location:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

> January OWASP Chapter Meeting - "**Data events, or why security is
> cloudier than you think" - Wendy Nather
> *
>
> *
> *
>
> *When:* This Tuesday, January 29th from 11:30a - 1:00p
>
> *Who:* Wendy Nather
>
> Wendy Nather is Research Director of the 451 Research Enterprise
> Security Practice. With over 20 years of IT experience, she built and
> managed the IT security program at the Texas Education Agency, where she
> directed multimillion-dollar initiatives for a statewide external user
> base of over 50,000. She also provided security guidance for the
> datacenter consolidation of 27 Texas state agencies.
>
> Wendy previously worked in various roles in the investment banking
> division of Swiss Bank Corp (now UBS). Based in Chicago, Zurich and
> London, she also served as the first IT Security Director for the EMEA
> region. She has spoken at various industry conferences in the US and
> abroad, and co-authored The Cloud Security Rules. She was also named one
> of Tripwire Inc.'s "Top 25 Influencers in Security."
>
>
> *Topic:* Data events, or why security is cloudier than you think.
>
> *Abstract:* Data security doesn't involve just securing data at rest or
> in transit. It also needs to be secured in use ? which means that at any
> point, the characteristics of the data can change. We call this
> situation a "data event," and it can mean that security requirements
> have to change as a result.
>
> This is not the same thing as logging event data; this is taking into
> account changes in the combination, use or business context surrounding
> specific data. For example, a press release is confidential and requires
> a certain set of security policies in the areas of access control, DLP,
> key management (if encryption is involved), and so on. But once the
> business event occurs, the press release suddenly becomes the opposite
> of confidential, and all the policies have to change immediately as a
> result.
>
> Data events can also occur when data elements are combined in particular
> ways so that they become covered by regulations. A query might produce a
> small enough sample size that it needs to be treated as protected
> information, or a doctor becomes a patient so that her name is now
> protected by HIPAA. Data events are often tied closely to the business
> context, and as such can mirror transactions and workflows.
>
> Data events are important because traditional security policies have
> been applied to the current container of the data: this database is
> confidential because some rows are confidential, or this Word document
> requires access control (but its content can be copied and pasted
> somewhere else). Container-centric security is too static for today's
> high-speed, big-data, cloud-based (pick as many buzzwords as you like)
> processing.
>
> This talk will describe the concept of data events, and will invite
> audience discussion on how security controls can be adapted to them.
>
>
> *Food:* Oh yeah, Taco Deli time! Please RSVP so we'll be sure to have
> enough for all! Only those who RSVP will be eligible for any
> drawings/giveaways that may take place! (and there will be very cool
> giveaways! )
