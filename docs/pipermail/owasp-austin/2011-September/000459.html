<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

First off, I apologize for the following long e-mail.  There's a lot going 
on over the next month or so and I wanted to make sure you have all of the 
details.  Here we go.... *cracks open a bud light*

September ISSA Meeting (9/23/2011)
The September ISSA meeting has been moved from it's regular date to this 
Friday, September 23 from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM.  This month features a 
topic and presenter that I think will be of particular interest to this 
crowd.  Mano 'dash4rk' Paul will be presenting on Applications in 
Jeopardy.  More details and a link to RSVP are available here --&gt; 
<A HREF="http://austinissa0911.eventbrite.com/">http://austinissa0911.eventbrite.com/</A>

September OWASP Meeting (9/27/2011)
The bad news is that this is our last OWASP meeting of the year as we have 
historically had lower attendance numbers around the holidays in November 
and December and LASCON takes the place of our October meeting.  The good 
news is that we have an awesome presentation for you by Ryan Smith of 
Praetorian called &quot;STAAF: A FLOSS Framework for Scalable and Sharable 
Android App Analysis&quot;.  STAAF stands for a Scalable Tailored Application 
Analysis Framework and was designed to allow an analyst to easily 
add/remove/configure various analysis modules and then process large 
numbers of applications at once or over time.  Then share the raw data, 
processed data, and results with other operations.  In this presentation 
Ryan will cover the STAAF architecture, the current status and available 
implementation, and maybe even show a quick demo with a handful of 
applications.  This tool was going to be debuted at LASCON, but Ryan's 
wedding in Brazil conflicted so we got him for our last official meeting 
instead.  As with the last meeting, if you want to make sure you get food, 
you need to RSVP beforehand and get there early.  As of 11:15 AM, the food 
becomes fair game for everyone and I can't guarantee that it won't run 
out.  RSVP here --&gt; <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2223027134">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2223027134</A>

Innovate Comes to You (9/27/2011)
A representative from IBM e-mailed me and let me know about a one-day deal 
that they are putting on on Thursday, September 27.  Unfortunately, this 
is the same day as our last OWASP meeting of the year, but I figured I'd 
pass it along anyway in case it interests any of you as it is FREE.  
&quot;Innovate Comes to You&quot; offers a keynote and four tracks of breakout 
sessions including security topics and hands-on sessions.  Review the full 
agenda on the web site at <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/InnovateTexas2011">http://tinyurl.com/InnovateTexas2011</A> for more 
details on the robust topics for developers, project managers, test teams, 
security managers and more.

Secure By Design Luncheon (9/28/2011)
I know that there at least a few Houston people on this list and perhaps 
this is interesting enough that some of you would be willing to drive 
there for it.  The IBM representative mentioned above also informed me 
about a &quot;Secure By Design&quot; luncheon that they are doing for FREE on 
Wednesday, September 28 at the III Forks restaurant in Houston.  The 
seminar addresses web application vulnerabilities and the software design 
and testing approaches and tools that can provide a better layer of 
protection for your enterprise - by design.  It runs from 11:30 AM to 1:00 
PM.  If you are interested in attending, send your name and contact 
information to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">events at us.ibm.com.</A>  They also gave me a PDF document with 
some additional details that I can pass along to you if you e-mail me 
back.

Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour (9/29/2011)
Don't forget that this months Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour was 
moved to Thursday, September 29.  It is from 5 PM to 7 PM at Sherlock's 
Baker Street Pub (9012 Research Blvd).  We will be in the party room 
located off to your right as you enter the main doors.  This month's happy 
hour is sponsored by our friends at HP/Fortify.  Don't miss out on this 
excellent opportunity for you to enjoy food and drinks while networking 
with fellow security professionals from Austin and the surrounding areas. 
RSVP here --&gt; <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2159994602">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2159994602</A>

InnoTech Austin (10/20/2011)
I won't get into too much detail as I sent a separate e-mail about this 
last week, but InnoTech is coming up next month and our chapter is 
offering a full security track at the conference.  If you would like to 
help out or just attend the conference free passes are available using the 
code &quot;OWASP11&quot; on the registration site.  Check out 
<A HREF="http://www.innotechaustin.com/">http://www.innotechaustin.com/</A> for more details.

LASCON (10/27/2011 &amp; 10/28/2011)
If you haven't heard of LASCON yet, then you haven't been paying 
attention.  We have two unique full-day training options on 10/27 and a 
full-day with 5 tracks of awesome presenters on 10/28.  If you want your 
custom laser-etched name badge along with discounted pricing, then you 
need to register by the end of September.  All of the details are 
available at <A HREF="http://www.lascon.org">http://www.lascon.org</A>

HouSecCon (11/3/2011)
The 2011 HouSecCon schedule is up at 
<A HREF="http://houstonseccon.com/conference2011/schedule/">http://houstonseccon.com/conference2011/schedule/</A> and it looks awesome! 
Again this year there are two tracks full of fantastic speakers and topics 
including the talk Orlando and I gave at BSidesLV.  Passes are only $25 
for what should be a fantastic conference.  Let me know if you want to 
carpool to Houston.

OK, that was a lot of stuff and I'm sure I forgot a thing or two in there 
somewhere, but you get the idea.  The next month is full of some awesome 
opportunities for our local security professionals for little to no money. 
 I'll see you soon!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
