Hello everyone!



The *Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour *for February is coming up *next
week*, Thursday, February 8th.  Sorry for the later notice, but with
Sherlock's Baker Street Pub closing, we needed to explore other venues.  We
decided to try out Baby A's on Stonelake Blvd in North Austin, and will see
how well that works out.


Our sponsor will be *RSA*.  Here are the details:


*Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour for February*

*When:* Thursday, February 8th, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm

*Where:* ****NEW LOCATION!**** Baby A's, 9505-B Stonelake Blvd, Austin,
Texas 78759 (corner of Stonelake and York Blvd, between Hwy 183 and
Mopac).  We will meet in the area inside the restaurant, in the far left
corner.

*What:* The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly event
coordinated by the OWASP Austin and Capital of Texas ISSA Chapters and

local information security professionals. If you're involved with InfoSec

conversation.

weeks, on Tuesday, February 27, 2018.

*OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting for February*

When: Tuesday, February 27th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

Where: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

Title: *Results from our latest research on DevSecOps*


There is a confluence of forces that disrupt the ability for organizations
to implement DevSecOps effectively. We continue to increase our dependence
on software but teams are still relatively immature in developing securely.
Our systems continue to grow exponentially complex. With IoT starting to
take off, there is no clear industry vision for security these devices.
Cybersecurity threats continue to rise. Even the most diligent teams find
themselves subtly gaining technical debt because they are unable to do the
job right.



This impact is felt across industries: telecommunications, financial,
software development, transportation, and medical just to name a few. So
what is our response as security professionals? We have software tools and
databases like OWASP Top 10, CWE/CVE, SANS Top 25 and so on. But what we
need is a set of patterns and anti-patterns on implementing DevSecOps.



Our talk will highlight what we?ve observed in conducting research from
Tier 1 peer reviewed articles from 2016 to the present. We will present
what seems to be emerging as a set of best practices as well as
anti-patterns in DevSecOps.
