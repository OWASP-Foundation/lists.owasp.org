Austin OWASPers,

I purchased three BSidesLV tickets when they originally went on sale (sold
out in 26 hours) and got two more as a result of being accepted as a
speaker.  Right now, I only have two others (besides me) who are using
these passes and with the date quickly approaching I'm looking to offload a
couple at face value ($20).  Preference goes to active Austin OWASPers, but
I'm willing to consider others as well.  Let me know if you're interested
in attending.

Jay McLaughlin and David Lister will soon be the new proud owners of a
BSidesLV ticket.  As for the rest of you, if I happen to come across any
more I will let you know.

Subject: [Owasp-austin] Happy Hour + Other OWASP events
Message-ID: <51DB894A.40508@owasp.org>

Austin OWASPers,

Below are some upcoming events. Enjoy!



* July Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, Sponsored by Security
Innovation*

*When*: Thursday, July 11th, from 5:00pm - 7:00pm

*Where*: Sherlock's Baker Street Pub and Grill, 183 and Burnet.

*Wha**t: *The Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour is a monthly
event coordinated between the Austin ISSA and OWASP Chapters to provide
security professionals an opportunity to network and have a good time!
*
**Our Sponsor:* Security Innovation

Security Innovation solutions are based on the three pillars of a secure
Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), which feed into one another to
create an ecosystem of repeatable, secure software development -
standards, education and assessment. For more than ten years, the
company has helped organizations build internal expertise and reduce
application risk.  The company's flagship products include TeamMentor,
the industry's largest library of application security eLearning
courses, and TeamMentor, "out of the box" secure development standards.

Bring your business cards and be entered into a drawing for a $50 B&N
Gift Card, courtesy of Security Innovation!
 
*RSVP:*  http://julysecurity.eventbrite.com/?s=15640627




*July OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting -- Matt Tesauro, Rackspace*

*When*: Tuesday, July 30th, from 11:30am-1:30pm

*Where*: National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C


*Title*: Testing at Cloud Speed:  Security Gone Agile


*Abstract*:
 
As the world of system and application deployment continues to change,
the sys admin and security community are changing with it. With agile
development, continuous deployment, the pace of change in IT has only
increased. After adding in Dev/Ops and cloud, the traditional sys admin
and security processes just don't work. How can you rapidly deliver
servers and applications while making sure they are built reliably and
securely. When you are deploying multiple times a day, there is no time
to fit in your week long security assessment.

A new concept of Test Driven Security, which is loosely based on the
tenants of Test Driven Development,  is beginning to emerge in the
application security community.  This talk will cover how Matt is
putting the practices in place  currently at Rackspace and how you can
architect your security work to be agile enough to keep up with the pace
of change today.  Even if you are not there today, you will be soon
enough.  Its time to embrace the change and say "Challenge Accepted".
*

**Speaker Bio*: Matt has been involved in the information technology and
application development for more than 10 years. He is currently the

focus has been in application security including testing, code reviews,
design reviews and training. His background in web application
development and system administration helped bring a holistic focus to
Secure SDLC efforts he's driven.

He has taught both graduate level university courses and for large
financial institutions. Matt has presented and provided training a
various industry events including DHS Software Assurance Workshop, Agile
Austin, AppSec EU, AppSec US, AppSec Academia, and AppSec Brazil. Matt

pre-configured with tools and documentation for testing web applications
- all running on Linux (of course). Industry designations include the
