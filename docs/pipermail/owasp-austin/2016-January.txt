OWASP Austin Chapter Monthly Meeting -- Tuesday, January 26th from 11:30 AM
to 1:00 PM


*CryptoParty*


In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars.  We must be free to
communicate and associate without fear.


To realize our right to privacy and anonymity online, we need
peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced solutions.  CryptoParties provide the
opportunity to meet up and learn how to use these solutions to give us all
the means with which to assert our right to privacy and anonymity online.
Topics include technologies for securing your chats, your phone calls, your
e-mails, and your computer documents.


On Tuesday, January 26 at 11:45 AM, the Austin Chapter of the OWASP
Foundation invites you to join us for our second annual CryptoParty where
you will learn the tools and techniques to keep you safe from prying eyes.
The event will be held in Building C, Room 1S13, on the National
Instruments campus (11500 N Mopac Expwy, Austin, TX 78759).  Please RSVP at
the link below and feel free to extend this invitation to others you feel
may have a need for data privacy.
