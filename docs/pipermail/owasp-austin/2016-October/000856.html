<PRE>Hello Everyone!


Just a reminder that our monthly OWASP Austin Chapter meetings are
typically not held the last three months of the year.  This is mainly
because of our time spent on finalizing the planning for LASCON and the
holidays.  We will begin the meetings again in January.  I will send out an
email once we have the January meeting scheduled with a speaker.  Speaking
of which, if you are interested in speaking at one of our chapter meetings
next year, please contact our Speaker and Special Event Coordinator, Kate
Brew (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">katebrew at owasp.org</A>).


Also, the Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour, co-sponsored by OWASP
and ISSA Austin chapters, is on hiatus until January.


I wanted to take the opportunity to remind everyone that LASCON is less
than a month away, and want to encourage those who have not yet registered
to consider doing so.  LASCON, which is organized by our OWASP Austin
Chapter, is our main source of annual income to support our following
year's expenses, one of which is to provide food for our monthly chapter
meetings.  Your participation in LASCON goes a long way in supporting the
chapter and helping to provide other training opportunities in which we
hope to offer for free or a minimal fee.


As an additional plug, we have some great sessions lined up, but please do
not forget about the two-day training classes being offered that are
jam-packed with material by experts:



   - Threat Modeling Made Simple
   &lt;<A HREF="https://lascon2016.sched.org/event/8RCd/threat-modeling-made-simple">https://lascon2016.sched.org/event/8RCd/threat-modeling-made-simple</A>&gt;
   - Understand JavaScript and HTML5 Features to Secure Your Client-side
   Code
   &lt;<A HREF="https://lascon2016.sched.org/event/8RCa/understand-javascript-and-html5-features-to-secure-your-client-side-code">https://lascon2016.sched.org/event/8RCa/understand-javascript-and-html5-features-to-secure-your-client-side-code</A>&gt;
   - Taking your AppSec program to 11: Automation and AppSec Pipelines
   &lt;<A HREF="https://lascon2016.sched.org/event/8RCh/taking-your-appsec-program-to-11-automation-and-appsec-pipelines">https://lascon2016.sched.org/event/8RCh/taking-your-appsec-program-to-11-automation-and-appsec-pipelines</A>&gt;
   - Advanced Web Hacking and Secure Coding
   &lt;<A HREF="https://lascon2016.sched.org/event/8RCe/advanced-web-hacking-and-secure-coding">https://lascon2016.sched.org/event/8RCe/advanced-web-hacking-and-secure-coding</A>&gt;

The training is world-class but at a very reduced cost to you.  For only *$849
you get two full days of training AND two full days of conference*.  You
will find the exact same training offered by other conferences for over
$1500 for the training alone!  Really, this is a bargain.  Please consider
signing up for one of these if you can.


One other thing ... we still have sponsorship opportunities available for
LASCON.  If your company, or perhaps you know of a company, is looking for
sponsorship opportunities, please contact our Sponsor Coordinator, Matt
Snider (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-austin">matt.snider at owasp.org</A>).


As always, I appreciate all that you do to make our local chapter a
success.  I hope to see you all at LASCON.


Thanks,

Tiana Chandler

OWASP Austin Chapter Leader
