Austin OWASPers,

Check out the following announcements



    OWASP Austin April Chapter Meeting - CSP to the Rescue - Neil
    Matatall, Twitter

*Please RSVP at the link below so we can plan for food. By doing this, 
you will also be signed up for our monthly drawings!*

*When:* Tuesday, April 30th, from 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Where:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Topic:*CSP to the Rescue

Abstract: CSP to the rescue XSS is still very much an unsolved problem. 
Browser quirks, contextual mismatches, and programmer error can be 
attributed to 100% of stored/reflected XSS. It is a problem we have been 
battling for almost 20 years. Even with input validation and output 
encoding, how can we be certain that we will never execute unintended 
Javascript? CSP. Implementing CSP to provably disable cross-site 
scripting isn't trivial, but I propose that anyone can do it. During 
this presentation we'll look at how the spec accomplishes its goal, 
recommendations for implementing its application, lessons learned, and 
tools that support the application of CSP.


*Speaker:* Neil Matatall, Twitter

Neil is a security engineer for Twitter. He focuses on integrating 
security technologies into the software development stack at all levels. 
He would prefer to grow a powerful neckbeard and code in the dark, but 
sometimes life gets in the way. He has been involved with OWASP since 
2008 and had lead the OWASP OC chapter and has contributed to many open 
source projects.

*Food:* Taco Deli, Sponsored by the Lonestar Application Security 
Conference(LASCON) (<A HREF="http://www.lascon.org">http://www.lascon.org</A>)
