<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

Please don't forget to RSVP to see Joe Brady from Veracode talk about 
&quot;Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors&quot; at the OWASP meeting next 
Tuesday (8/30) if you want to ensure that you get to eat.  Our new policy 
will be that up until 11:45, the only people who will be allowed to get 
food are the ones on the RSVP list.  RSVP Here --&gt;  
<A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2064867073">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2064867073</A>

We have completed the CFP's for LASCON 2011 speakers and should be 
announcing the list of presentations at the next OWASP meeting on Tuesday. 
 Be sure to get there early to get your preview of the awesomeness of our 
LASCON 2011 lineup!

If you can't make LASCON for some reason or have a little bit of spare 
change floating around in your training budget, you should seriously 
consider coming with me to check out HouSecCon.  It is taking place on 
November 3, 2011 in Houston, TX and registration is only $25 for a bunch 
of great speakers!!!  Huge props to David Nester and Michael Farnum for 
putting on a conference that rivals LASCON for value.  To register, go to 
<A HREF="http://houstonseccon.com/">http://houstonseccon.com/</A> and look for the Registration link on the main 
menu.  Then send me a quick note if you're interested in carpooling to 
Houston like we did last year.

See you Tuesday!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
President, Austin OWASP
