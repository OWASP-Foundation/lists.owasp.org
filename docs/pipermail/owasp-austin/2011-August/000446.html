<PRE>Austin OWASPers,

I hope that everyone who went to Vegas this past week made it safely back 
to Austin with a ton of new ideas and only some minor sleep deprivation. I 
spent my days at the Las Vegas BSides event and I was thoroughly impressed 
by the venue, speakers, and the organization behind the event.  I would 
highly recommend attending next year if you can find a way to swing it. 
One of the coolest new tools that I saw at BSides was called Agnitio (
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/agnitiotool/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/agnitiotool/</A>).  It's a tool to help 
developers and security professionals conduct manual security code reviews 
in a consistent and repeatable way.  It uses the targets that Keith Turpin 
talked to us about in the June meeting on the OWASP Secure Coding 
Practices Quick Reference Guide, but displays them as checklists in a tool 
that can be used to audit and track the progress of an application over 
time.  Check it out!

I wanted to make sure to give everyone a heads up that the Austin Security 
Professionals Happy Hour will not be this week as it originally had been 
on the schedule.  I have pushed it instead to next week in order to 1) fit 
better with our sponsors schedule and 2) allow us all a chance to sober up 
from Vegas.  So please join us all out at Sherlock's for our regular happy 
hour event on Thursday, August 18 from 5 to 7 PM thanks to our sponsor, 
Set Solutions.  As always, this is an excellent opportunity for you to 
enjoy food and drinks while networking with your fellow security 
professionals from Austin and the surrounding areas.  Please RSVP via the 
link below:

See you soon!
