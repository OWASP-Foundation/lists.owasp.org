44Con 2012

44Con 2012 will be held at the Millennium Gloucester Conference Centre in
Kensington from the 5th ? 7th September 2012. Two days of separate training
will take place on the 3rd and 4th of September 2012. The 5th of September
is a special Fast Track Day for busy people unable to take the full 3 days
off as well as students looking to become the information security experts
of tomorrow. The fast track day features an Infosec track and turbo talks
from speakers providing background to the research to be released over the
remaining two days. This is in addition to two workshop tracks and the
networking area. The 6th and 7th of September are reserved for a pure
technical security conference with no Infosec track and are ideally suited
for technical analysts unable to take the full 3 days away from work to
attend.
