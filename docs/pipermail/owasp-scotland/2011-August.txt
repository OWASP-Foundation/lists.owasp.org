Subject: [Owasp-scotland] September meeting update
Message-ID: <CAAG-OzD8x0euQoEenF4j8FMeQFrBKRnnCJnmOQ94ADcHGvaJNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've setup the eventbrite ticket site for the September meeting here

http://owaspscotland-sept2011.eventbrite.com/

Also have some details for our 2 talks (doors still open if anyone has
something they'd like to present on), including a really interesting
sounding one on GPS spoofing!

if you're interested in coming along, it'd be great if you can sign up
on the site, so we can keep an eye on numbers and let Edinburgh Uni
know who's coming along.

As ever, feel free to forward this to anyone you think might be interested.


Cheers

Rory
