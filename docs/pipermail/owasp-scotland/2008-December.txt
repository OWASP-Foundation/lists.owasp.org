Hi all,

Has tonight's OWASP meeting been canceled? One of my colleagues
highlighted the fact that the OWASP Scotland page said "Unfortunately
due to some logistical problems the meeting on the 4th
won't be going ahead. We'll be looking to sort something out in the new
year
". 

Is this a new update; if so did an email go out to the OWASP email list? I didn't get one...


Cheers,
Rob

Hi all, 

Looks like a lot of people have got challenges around the date of the 27th, including our prospective speaker!

So the thought is rather than rush into a date which not everyone can make we should pick a date slightly further out and give people lots of notice...

So the new date/location/speaker is

Date - Thursday 4th December
Location - Gogarburn House, Edinburgh (It's on the RBS campus, next to the airport)
Speaker - Dinis Cruz, who'll be giving an update on OWASPs plan for 2009, following the OWASP EU summit in November.

Hopefully that'll work well for people...


Cheers


Rory

I have been reliably informed that the meeting is cancelled.  This is due to one of the speakers cancelling, which then caused the other speaker (the one I really wanted to see) changing his plans and going to London instead.

Hi all ,

Sincere apologies for all the confusion here (I'm out of the country
with limited access to my home mail),  I should have updated the
mailing list as well as the website.

I was going to type out the whole timeline but it ended up looking
messy.  Suffice to say we had a whole series of problems with
confirming venues, speakers and communicating between ourselves due to
everyone being really busy at the moment, which led to us not being
able to send out a 100% confirmation of the meeting, until
realistically it was going to be too late to make sure people were
going to be able to make it, so the only realistic proposition was to
hold off (rather than get speakers to travel when we've not been able
to confirm a good turn-out)


Regards

Rory

Hi all,

I'm after some feedback on a pseudo-process for building a password reset
function for a web application.  I have attached a jpg of a visio diagram
for it but if that doesn't get through to the mailing list here is the
process:

   1. User cannot remember password
   2. User clicks 'Forgot Password' link.
   3. User submits their registered email address (Not their username).
   4. Applciation responds with screen message.
      - If your account exists then an email has been sent to you.  Please
      follow the instructions in the email to reset your password.
   5. Application looks up email address and confirms that it is valid.
   6. Application creates a random and unique string to identify this
   password reset request.
   7. Application creates email message with URL:
   -
      https://admin.portal.com/forgotpassword.aspx?uid=3A30FC410A2BE3FA6CD07E600A2C6DA3
   8. User receives email and clicks link.
   9. Application compares unique token in POST data to internally created
   and stored token.
      - If a match occurs then user is presented with password reset
      function.
   - If a match does not occur then user is presented with initial logon
      page.
   10. Password reset function then goes on to ask one or more previously
   created 'secret' questions.


Any thoughts?  Anyone created a process like this before and have any
feedback?

thanks
lee.
