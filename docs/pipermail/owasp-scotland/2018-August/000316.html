<PRE>Greetings OWASP Scotland community,

The next OWASP Scotland Chapter meeting pencilled in the diary for Thursday
20th September. Many thanks to Fanduel, who has kindly offered to host this
event for us.  They will also be providing pizza and beer!

Tickets are, as usual, available on Eventbrite via link the link below.

*DNS over TLS / DNS over HTTPS - The privacy magic bullet?*
Speaker: Sean Wright

With the introduction of Cloudflares new DNS service there was much hype
around how it supported DNS over HTTPS and how this would help privacy.
This talk investigates some potential short comings with this technology
and how it is still possible in some cases to have information leaked about
what site is being visited.


*Raising Organisational Security Awareness with CTFs*
Speaker: Rob Jansson

Capture the Flag (CTF) events are run frequently throughout the security
community and conferences around the globe. Outside of security this is
commonly unknown territory and means little to Joe Bloggs. Everyone within
an organisation is responsible for security, whether it be data entry,
developers, infrastructure / hosting services etc.; and security is often
seen a blocker or some sort of black magic. This talk will walk you through
how a CTF event was run within an organisation to raise security awareness
amongst its employees, the challenges, successes and failures encountered.
At the end of the talk you should have a good idea how to get one setup and
whether you&#8217;d want to incorporate this into your organisation&#8217;s security
programme.

For attending this event you will be able to claim 2 CPE points.

Date: Thursday 20th September
Time: 18:00 &#8211; 20:00
Location: Fanduel, Quartermile One, Level 4, 15 Lauriston Place, Edinburgh,
EH39EP

Tickets available on Eventbrite:
