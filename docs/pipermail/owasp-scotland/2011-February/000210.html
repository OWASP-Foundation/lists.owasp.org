<PRE>Hi all,

Just to let you know where we're up to with the meeting in February.

On the speaker front, things are looking good.  We've got Eoin Keary
(OWASP Global board) lined up to do us a piece on the outcomes from
the OWASP summit which is happening next week in Portugal (there's
also a page on remote participation in the summit on the OWASP site
here <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Remote_Registration">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Remote_Registration</A> ).
 We've also got a talk on BSIMM lined up as well, which is great as
it's very interesting project and it'll be interesting to hear more
about it.

On the venue side of things, it's looking a bit trickier, as we've not
got anywhere lined up as yet.  Still looking around, but if anyone has
a venue that we can use, ideally in Central Edinburgh, please do drop
me a line :)


cheers

Rory
