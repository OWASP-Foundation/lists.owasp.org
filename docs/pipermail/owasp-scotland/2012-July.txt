Hi Guys,

Apologies for posting a quick job requirement, but I would really like 
to find someone that can help in a fix..

I wish to find a pentester that is willing to test a web application for 
us on behalf of a client.

This is a 2 day test looking to commence within the next 2 weeks.
Any interested guys please get in touch. No specific certs required.

Best regards

-Cary

Thank you guys. I have managed to find someone. Thank you for all that 
replied!

 From time to time I get these, out of my comfort zone tests, but I will 
be happy to post more opportunities if allowed.
