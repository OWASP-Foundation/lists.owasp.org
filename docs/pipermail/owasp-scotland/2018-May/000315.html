<PRE>All,

We are pleased to let you know we have the second 2018 OWASP Scotland
Chapter meeting pencilled in the diary for Monday 21st of May. Many thanks
to EY who has kindly offered to host this event for us.

On this occasion we have the pleasure of having Tal Mozes do a talk on
&#8216;Cyber Terror&#8217;. Tal comes from an impressive background in information
security; and is currently a Partner at EY leading their Hacktics Cyber
Security Center.

In the second talk Rob will be presenting on &#8216;Responsible Disclosure &#8211; The
Good, the Bad and the Ugly&#8217;.

For attending this event you will be able to claim 2 CPE points.


* Cyber Terror*

Speaker: Tal Mozes

Most of us, cyber security professionals, help in the fighting of
cybercrime.
Most of our threat agents are opportunists, ideologists, organized crime
and other Advanced Adversaries. But between those threat agents there are
also terrorists, which are using the latest technologies to plant terror.
&gt;<i>From information warfare, to targeted attacks, what motivates them, what
</I>can they do and how can we all help in preventing the next digital terror
attack.


* Responsible Disclosure &#8211; The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*

Speaker: Rob Jansson

What is responsible disclosure and is it something that would help protect
your company from cyber attack? In this talk we will examine the benefits
of having a responsible disclosure policy in place, what can go wrong and
get ugly (really fast!).
