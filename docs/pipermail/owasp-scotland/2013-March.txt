Hi All,

Just a note to say thanks to everyone who came along last night and to
Martin for hosting.  I'm sure everyone would agree that it was a "lively"
meeting!

As I mentioned in my usual refrain if anyone has a talk they'd like to do,
let me know.  I think we've got a couple of candidates already, but the
more the merrier :) Dates will likely be around early-mid May

One quick thing I wanted to mention is that if people have signed up and
realise that they won't be able to make it along, please do let me know.

I had a couple of notes from people who realised they wouldn't be able to
attend, but I think we had quite a gap between sign-ups and expected
attendees even after that.

Thanks

Rory

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] JBUG (JBOSS community user group) in Scotland
Message-ID: <DUB120-W17C2A30DD15688AB17FAF9A6E30@phx.gbl>


There is a new JBUG (JBOSS community user group) in Scotland which had its first meeting last Thursday.  It was interesting to hear how JBoss, a large public sector entity and a development lead were viewing how these things were evolving.
 
Slide decks can be found at https://community.jboss.org/groups/jbug-scotland and if you join the community you can get notification of when the next event is being held.
 
It would be interesting to get additional security views on how the solution organisations like JBoss are selling today will be built by customers tomorrow and tested by the security community the day after.
