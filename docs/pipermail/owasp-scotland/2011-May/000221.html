<PRE>Just to add to the information about the Glasgow meetup. There will also be a presentation about Honeycomb development, the site has still to be updated about this but should be interesting.

Hi all,

Thought it would be of interest to the group.  there's a Glasgow
Technology Network event at the start of June where Robert Ray will be
presenting on Ethical hacking and counter-measures.  If you're
interested in going along, you can register here
<A HREF="http://www.glasgowtechnet.com/events/17500762/">http://www.glasgowtechnet.com/events/17500762/</A> .

On another note I was thinking of arranging an OWASP Scotland meet-up
in June some time after the AppSecEU conference in Dublin (which is on
the 9th and 10th).  So usual questions apply

 - If anyone's got a venue we could use that'd be great :)
 - If anyone would like to speak, also great.
 - If anyone's got any topics they'd like to see a presentation on,
let me know and I'll see if I can arrange something.

In terms of one talk , I'll be happy to give an update on what
happened at AppsecEU for anyone who's not able to get over to Dublin.

In terms of dates I was thinking either Thursday June 16th or Thursday
June 30th?


Cheers

Rory
