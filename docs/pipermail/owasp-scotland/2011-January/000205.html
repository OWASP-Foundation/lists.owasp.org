Happy New Year - 

Feb 24th works for me.  Would be good to catch up with everybody, get
some security chat, and maybe have a part of the agenda for latest Owasp
news? Both globally and Scotland?

Hi all,

Happy new year, hope everyone survived the snow&amp;ice of the last little
while.

In terms of the next meeting date, I was thinking Thursday Feb 24th, if
that works for people?

Cheers

Rory
