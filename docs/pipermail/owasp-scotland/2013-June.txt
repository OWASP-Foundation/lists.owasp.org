Subject: [Owasp-scotland] May Meeting
Message-ID: <CAAG-OzAFvyMbwa=rEG7X=-=hNeu2AdqqieyQ6hpSCwXt67q=hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for coming along last week and
specifically to all our speakers for the talks and martin for hosting.

As I mentioned at the end of the meeting, I reckon that start of September
would be good for our next meeting to dodge the holiday season and the
fringe.

I've got a couple of potential talks to check on but if anyone would like
to do a talk or see a talk on something in particular, let me know.

Cheers

Rory

Dear All

I've got some fantastic news to announce, earlier this week the OWASP Executive confirmed that the joint UK Chapters bid to host the OWASP EU APPSEC Conference 2014 in Cambridge at Anglia Ruskin University in late June/late July 2014 has been successful. 

This means we will be hosting up to 400 OWASP Chapters/Members, IT Security Professionals and Application Developers for a 4 day conference and training event in late June or early July 2014 which will tie in successfully with the major work we have already done in Cambridge with OWASP Chapter events we've been hosting with a program of professional IT speakers for both local Computing professionals and students. 

We will be forming a conference organisers committee and  if anyone would like to become involved  in any of the following ways or suggestions of how you think you would like to help, 

Becoming a member of the Conference Committee
Sponsorship Opportunities from IT Security related organisations
Suggestions for Keynote Speakers or volunteering to do a presentation
Forming part of an editorial panel for reviewing research papers to be presented at the conference.
Helping to put together "Capture the Flag" style competitions
Helping during the conference with greeting and organising delegates
Helping with conference social activities 
Helping with conference IT Systems
Helping to facilitate IT Security Training Events
Developing Conference Apps (Student project opportunity)
Help with advertising the event nationally and internationally.
Bringing together both undergraduate and postgraduate student activities  & project papers.
Possibly some joint activities with University of Cambridge as Well

Please feel free to contact me if you require any more detail or if you would like to get involved.

I look forward to hearing from you

Adrian
