<PRE>All, 

 

Just an update on last quarter's talk from me - the slides have finally
slithered their way on to the internets.  Link below.

 

See you on the 28th.

 

Andrew 

 

PS I'll be heading over to the peartree after the talks if anyone else
fancies a pint?

I added the presentation to the project page.

 

There is a new section under translations called &quot;Related Presentations&quot;

Does that look okay?
