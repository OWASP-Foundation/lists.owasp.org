Hi all,

Just to let you know where we're up to with the meeting in February.

On the speaker front, things are looking good.  We've got Eoin Keary
(OWASP Global board) lined up to do us a piece on the outcomes from
the OWASP summit which is happening next week in Portugal (there's
also a page on remote participation in the summit on the OWASP site
here http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Remote_Registration ).
 We've also got a talk on BSIMM lined up as well, which is great as
it's very interesting project and it'll be interesting to hear more
about it.

On the venue side of things, it's looking a bit trickier, as we've not
got anywhere lined up as yet.  Still looking around, but if anyone has
a venue that we can use, ideally in Central Edinburgh, please do drop
me a line :)


cheers

Rory

Rory,

The offer of the Quorum office in Greenside Lane is there if you need it. The boardroom will take about 15 (10 round the main table), it's five minutes' walk from Waverley and there's parking at the Greenside Lane car park (Omni Centre). Let me know if you need it.

Charles

Oddly the list of the FSF site doesn't seem to include one of his
talks that I've heard on the EdLUG list is happening in Dundee.

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Travel 3G routers follow up
Message-ID: <201102281117.32163.callum.wilson@rapsec.co.uk>

hi folks,

can't remember who I was talking to last thursday evening; someone asked for 
the links for the 3G routing solution that I use.

It's just a simple 3G <--> WiFi router that you plug one of the mobile 
operators' USB dongle into.  I have an unbranded direct-from-china version 
that has a battery backup (used in a job where we used a van)

http://www.solwise.co.uk/3g-routers-3g-etr9350.htm

I use a E170 usb 3g modem and sometimes use a high gain antenna with sleeve to 
improve the bandwidth:

http://www.solwise.co.uk/3g-datacard-to-antenna-adapters-adpt-026.htm
http://www.solwise.co.uk/3g-antenna-indoor-omni-5db.htm

It's a magmount antenna and works quite well in a mobile (e.g. car/van) 
environment. Sure a jailbroken phone running a hotspot app will provide 
similar capability, but these give you much better range and don't use up your 
phone battery!

cheers,
c
