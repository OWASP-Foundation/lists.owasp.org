Event Details

A shorter OWASP East Scotland session is now set for Thursday the 17th at
our usual place, the Edinburgh University's Informatics Department.

After having his flights cancelled in April, Mario Heiderich is keen to
reclaim his bottle of Malt Whisky and so we will be opening the doors at
18:00; talk starts at 18:30.

Tea, coffee, cakes and crisps provided.



Talk





The Inner HTML Apocalypse: How mXSS Attacks Change Everything we Believed
so Far





Dr.-Ing. Mario Heiderich







Everything about Reflected, Persistent and DOM based Cross Site Scripting
attacks have already been discussed, so why the need for another talk on
the subject? In his talk, Mario will introduce and demonstrate this recent
technique called mutation-XSS, proving there is still a lot to be discussed
about XSS attacks.

Mario is a researcher at Ruhr University Bochum and the director of Cure53,
a security consultancy and penetration testing company. He has presented in
many conferences, including the AppSec Research OWASP Conference in
Hamburg, August 2013.




Cheers


Rory
