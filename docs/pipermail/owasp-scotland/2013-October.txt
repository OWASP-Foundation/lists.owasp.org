Hi all,

If I remember correctly a few years back we had a really great talk on
Scada hacking that included a youtube video of a water treatment network
being attacked.

Can anyone provide a link to that video?

Dave

Hi All,

Just sorting out the meeting for November as I mentioned at the last 
meeting.  I'll get the eventbrite set-up once I've got a couple more 
details fixed, but the date for the diary is Thursday 28th November.

Cheers

Rory
