We have a FREE ticket for the BruCON Security Conference at the end of next week, kindly donated by John Stock, that we are now auctioning for ChildLine.

 

We are currently raising money for ChildLine (NSPCC) having entered a car in the White Hat Rally, and as an added incentive to get you to part with your money and make a donation to ChildLine through our giving page we will give the BruCON ticket to the individual who donates the highest amount.

 

Full details can be found on our team page at whr2010.co.uk

 

I will be at the Leeds OWASP meeting this evening if you have any questions, and Sharon will be at OWASP in Dublin tomorrow and Friday.

 

Get yourself a bargain, normal retail 195 Euro!

 

Thanks for supporting ChildLine,

 

Martin

 

 

White Hat Rally in support of ChildLine (NSPCC)

 

At the end of September I'm driving in the rally to raise money for ChildLine to help protect vulnerable children. We have pledged to raise ?5,000 through personal donations and corporate sponsorship. Please take a moment to visit our team website and learn more about the rally, the charity and how you can help to make a difference to the lives of vulnerable children. ChildLine want to stop cruelty to children.

Hello I would just like to introduce myself to this mailing list.

 

My name is Danny and I run a company called Aerovision IT, based in
Cupar, Fife (yes we actually have the internet there).

 

I am interested in OWASP as our business conducts Penetration Testing
against a range of Servers and Networks, including Websites and Web
Servers.

 

We also manage and support dedicated Web Servers for larger companies
(including government departments) and therefore have a keen interest in
their security.

 

Anyway, if anyone would like to chat then please feel free to email me,

 

Thank you,

Hi Danny,

Welcome to the list !

We've got quite a few people from the Scottish pen testing companies on list although it's a bit quiet at the moment.

I'm hoping to sort out a meeting in October (just sorting out venue/speakers).  We usually meet up in edinburgh as that's where most people seem to be based .

If there's any questions / queries you've got on owasp or general app sec. Feel free to ask away :)

Cheers

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Meeting : 21st October
Message-ID: <AANLkTik05x8SsCHGH5YuRadH5FHaN7HRQiHWaXpFLkFy@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

So I was thinking it's been a while since we've had a meeting :o)

So the prospective date is Thursday 21st October, it'd be good to get
an idea if that date works for people, so replies to the list either
way would be good :)

In terms of speakers, a couple of people on-list mentioned that they'd
like to hear something on forensics/incident response, so I've managed
to line up Dave Stubley who's had a fair amount of experience in that
arena with a large financial service company who I'm sure you've all
heard of :)

If possible I'd like to get a speaker on a web application topic as
well, so if anyone's got something they'd like to do a talk on then
feel free to drop me a line.


Cheers

Rory
