<PRE>Incidentally, just in case you thought my talk wasn't quite in the OWASP
remit. This article (that came out while we were speaking) ought to help
explain why OWASP should become more interested...

After all, it's OUR infrastructure.

&gt;<i> To last night's attendees,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks a lot for coming along to my talk, I really appreciated the interest
</I>&gt;<i> in the subject matter. Shailendra got safely away this morning and said he
</I>&gt;<i> was quite pleased to represent Cambridge's Security Lab up here, and that
</I>&gt;<i> you all took an interest in and understood the economics of the
</I>&gt;<i> (in)Security. I look forward to attending one of your talks next time :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realise my talk was light on technical detail, but I'm sure you can
</I>&gt;<i> understand why. If you are interested in the subject, please feel free to
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail me, and we can discuss specific areas that might apeal to whatever
</I>&gt;<i> specialty you already have. There's plenty of work for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, I am interested in doing this talk (or variants of it) in other
</I>&gt;<i> places, to get more people interested in industrial system security and CNI.
</I>&gt;<i> If you know of any groups that would be interested, please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#201;ireann
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @Fiona I'd love to come out to Ireland for example...I haven't been to
</I>&gt;<i> Dublin since I was a kid...
</I>&gt;<i>
