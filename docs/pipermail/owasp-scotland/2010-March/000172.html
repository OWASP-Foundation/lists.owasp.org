<PRE>Hi all,

Just a quick note following on from the meeting on Thursday.

First off I'd like to thank &#201;ireann and Shailendra for the talks, very
interesting (if a bit scary to think about too much :) )

Some links to the stuff I talked about.

OWASP Application security verification standard can be found here -
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project.">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project.</A>

The Global Connections committee homepage is here -
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Connections_Committee.">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Connections_Committee.</A>

On the connections committee side of things, if anyone knows of a
group who you think would be interested in a presentation on Web
application security, be that professional bodies like th BCS,
educational groups or business groups, post it up on the list and we
can see if we can sort something out.  I think there was general
agreement that it'd be good for us to do some work on connecting with
people outside of the immediate security community and an introductory
talk would seem like a good way to start.

On dates for meetings, I've lined up some dates below at 2 month
intervals, going for the first Thursday of the month, do these seem ok
for everyone?

Dates

Thursday 6th May
Thursday 1st July
Thursday 2nd September
Thursday 4th November

Also as discussed, if anyone's got a talk they'd like to do, or a
topic they'd like to hear a talk on, let me know.

Cheers

Rory
</PRE>
