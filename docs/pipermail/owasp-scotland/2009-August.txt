Message-ID: <5230459f0908191150x132837a5jdd60bfc142b659eb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

A couple of updates from me.  The meeting we'd been hoping to have
with Brian Chess/Gary McGraw, unfortunately looks like it's not
happening.  Their plans have changed and they're not going to be over
in Scotland at that time.

So I was thinking that it'd be good to have a "regular" meeting in
September.  In terms of dates, would Tuesday the 15th work for
everyone? Also would anyone like to volunteer to do a quick (or indeed
long) talk ?  There's a couple of potential speakers already but the
more the merrier :)


Cheers

Rory

Hi all,

Rory A has been able to secure us meeting space at Ernst & Young (same
place as last time) for Tuesday 15th.  So plan is start at 6:30 and
have the talks kick off at 7pm, and retiring to Grape for those who
are so inclined afterwards.  So far we've got one volunteer to speak,
so if anyone else would like to chip just drop me a line.   I'll put
details of the speakers up on the OWASP site as we get closer to the
date.

If it'd be of interest I'd be happy to do a brief piece on what I
thought was interesting coming out of this years Defcon conference,

Address Details - Ernst & Young, 10 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2 2DZ.
 Just turn right out of the lifts, through the doors and the rooms
right ahead.


Cheers
