Dear UK Chapters

Further to my previous email, thank you for your input - especially
Ceri for his extended advice and final review of this version.  This
first draft of our submission to the Digital Britain Report is
available in PDF format on:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Digital_Britain_Interim_Report

This has been drafted in conjunction with other members of these
mailing lists and draws heavily on information already published on
the OWASP website.  However, the language and focus relate
specifically to the context of the report.  For example, we have
avoided using the word "vulnerability" since "vulnerable groups" is
currently heavily used in the document, and use "defects" instead.
OWASP is referred to in the third person, and "we" and "our" are
reserved for society in general.

Your further comments, via these lists or directly, are welcome so
that we may produce an updated version in the next few days, with a
view to asking approval from the Industry Committee on Monday or
Tuesday next week.

Regards

Colin Watson
Global Industry Committee

Ok,
 
How does the 9th of April sound? It's the Thursday before the Easter hols,
which means it's not a school night. 
 
I know three of us are in Edinburgh, does that suit the rest of you?
 
We can argue over pubs once we've settled on a city :)

Ok,

 

How does the 9th of April sound? It's the Thursday before the Easter hols, which means it's not a school night. 

 

I know three of us are in Edinburgh, does that suit the rest of you?

 

We can argue over pubs once we've settled on a city :)

And Edinburgh works best for me that week.

All,

Why don't we try All Bar One (Festival SQ) at 6:00PM. They have big tables
and a decent selection of beers/wines/soft drinks. I'll make a little sign
that says OWASP and put it on the table.

All are welcome. 

We can have an introduction, a few laughs, and see if we can help Rory get
this chapter up and running. :)
