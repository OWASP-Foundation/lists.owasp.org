Hi all ,

Sorry for the late notice (been out and about on my travels a bit!)
but wondering if anyone would be up for a meet, say last week of this
month/first week of next? Also does anyone have access to a venue we
could use for the meeting, as unfortunately EY are full-up this
month...?



Cheers


Rory

Hi all ,

as a more concrete proposal, how does 6pm at Abbey Business Centre (83
Princes St (above Superdrug)) on the 26th November work for people?
We've got a presenter in that Lee's offered to
do a presentation on physical security / lock picking, which should be cool...

RSVP's ASAP PLS :)

Hi all ,

as a more concrete proposal, how does 6pm at Abbey Business Centre (83
Princes St (above Superdrug)) on the 26th November work for people?
We've got a presenter in that Lee's offered to
do a presentation on physical security / lock picking, which should be
cool...

RSVP's ASAP PLS :)

Hi all,

Ok looks like there's enough folks around to do this :)

So meeting is 6pm(probably start the talk around 6:30pm) at Abbey
Business Centre (83 Princes St (above Superdrug)) on the Thursday the
26th November.


so main talk will be Lee (overview of it below) but sure there'll be
some time to have a general chat about some of the OWASP stuff as
well.  If people haven't seen it, there's a new Release candidate of
the top-10 2010 version just out which has some kinda interesting
changes in it..

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Whitepaper on privacy economics
Message-ID: <4B104C88.401@blueyonder.co.uk>

All,

I was chatting with someone at the last meeting (David Kerr, perhaps?) 
about privacy economics. Specifically about some studies done on the 
discrepency between what people will pay for other people's data and the 
rate they charge for their own. It also covers some interestingly 
psychological effects called 'endowment'.

On a side note, I'm looking for work come Feb 1st, so if anyone wants a 
CV, let me know :)
