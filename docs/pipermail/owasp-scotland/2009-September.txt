Hi all,

Hope everyone's got the date for the meeting next Tuesday circled in
their calendars.

We've got 2 main talks lined up.  Rafe Piling will be doing a talk on
Burp suite, and Brian Porter will be doing one on Web Attack alerting
and IDSs.  Also depending on how we go for time I've got a couple of
slides on interesting stuff from Defcon 17...

Doors open 6:30pm at Ernst & Youngs offices, 5th Floor, 10 George
Street, Edinburgh

See you all there.

Cheers

Rory McCune

Hi all,

Just following on from the meeting on Tuesday, I recently came across
this blog http://cktricky.blogspot.com/ which has a burp tip of the
day.  Very handy and has some stuff that even more experienced users
might not know about.
