<PRE>All - as a follow up to our informal OWASP meeting last Thursday, here is 
the link to the infosec scotland events calendar:

<A HREF="http://www.infosec-scotland.com/">http://www.infosec-scotland.com/</A>

This is an active calendar, so updates happen on a regular basis - we can 
use this to schedule our meetings to avoid clashes etc.

Regards

Rory
