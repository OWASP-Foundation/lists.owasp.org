Hi all,

Just thinking we should try and get a meet-up setup...  How do people
feel about the end of June sometime?  Once we've got an agreeable date
and suggestions for talks would be cool :)

One topic, I'd be happy to do something on, if it'd be interesting is
some of the newer features of Metasploit that I've been looking at
recently...


Cheers

I have tentatively pencilled in the 25th as a date I can get space in 10 
George St. - if folks can confirm that is a useful date, I would certainly 
be interested in more info on your Metasploit 'sploits (been following 
your summaries on your blog)

Hi All,

Cool.  That definitely looks like a consensus for the 25th.  Rory A is
going to look to get the venue firmed up and it looks like we've got a
couple of topics for presentations on the night, impressions from the
AppSec Europe conference and Metasploit.

Anyone got particular views on kick off time?


cheers

It has to be after 5 at least for the Livingston contingent. Preferably 6,
but we can just make 5 when necessary.

Hi all,

ok looks like all's ok for the 25th June.

Location will be - Ernst & Young, 10 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2
2DZ.  IIRC just come up to the 5th floor and the meeting rooms are
there.

Timings will be :-

Doors open 6:30pm - have a chat and a coffee

Talks start 7:00pm - I'm ok to do 30 minutes on Metasploit, and TBC we
should have some thoughts on the AppSec Europe conference from a
couple of people who made it along.

pub afterwards for anyone who's interested :)

Sound good?

If you could RSVP to the list that'd be great so we've got an idea of numbers.


Cheers

Hi all,

ok looks like all's ok for the 25th June.

Location will be - Ernst & Young, 10 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2
2DZ.  IIRC just come up to the 5th floor and the meeting rooms are
there.

Timings will be :-

Doors open 6:30pm - have a chat and a coffee

Talks start 7:00pm - I'm ok to do 30 minutes on Metasploit, and TBC we
should have some thoughts on the AppSec Europe conference from a
couple of people who made it along.

pub afterwards for anyone who's interested :)

Sound good?

If you could RSVP to the list that'd be great so we've got an idea of numbers.

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Follow-up From last nights meeting
Message-ID: <5230459f0906260315t44bfa8b0v7aee8635f2b68519@mail.gmail.com>

Morning All,

just a quick recap and a couple of notes I picked up from last nights meeting.

First the list of Metasploit links I promised at the end of my
presentation is here http://wiki.mccune.org.uk/index.php/Metasploit ,
feel free to add relevant links to it.

Second as a reminder, if anyone's got any contacts at Scottish
universities that they'd be willing to share please drop out a note of
them and we'll see if we can get a decent list together for speaking
to about Application Security education.

For those of you who couldn't make it last night, we're planning
another meeting either at the start or end of August, depending on
speaker/venue availability.  I'll try and drop out some more details
on that as soon as possible.

Anything else I've missed that we need to follow up on?


Cheers

Rory McCune
