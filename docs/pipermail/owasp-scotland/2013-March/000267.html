<PRE>Hi All,

Just a note to say thanks to everyone who came along last night and to
Martin for hosting.  I'm sure everyone would agree that it was a &quot;lively&quot;
meeting!

As I mentioned in my usual refrain if anyone has a talk they'd like to do,
let me know.  I think we've got a couple of candidates already, but the
more the merrier :) Dates will likely be around early-mid May

One quick thing I wanted to mention is that if people have signed up and
realise that they won't be able to make it along, please do let me know.

I had a couple of notes from people who realised they wouldn't be able to
attend, but I think we had quite a gap between sign-ups and expected
attendees even after that.

Thanks

Rory
