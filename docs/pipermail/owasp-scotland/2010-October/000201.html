<PRE>Hi all,

Thanks for coming along to the meeting last night, I hope everyone
found it useful.  A couple of things from my presentation.

The Application Security QA Site that I mentioned can be found here
<A HREF="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431/application-security?referrer=5HVhxlag7hsQTrbrwxmuhA2">http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431/application-security?referrer=5HVhxlag7hsQTrbrwxmuhA2</A>
.  If you're interested in either asking or answering questions on
AppSec I'd say it's well worth signing up and committing to help out
(the more sign-ups the faster it goes live, from what I can see of the
site)

Also as I mentioned last night, it'd be really good if anyone would
like to do a talk, or has an idea of what they'd like to hear about,
where I can try and arrange a speaker.

Also if anyone's got premises that we can use (central Edinburgh, or
maybe central Glasgow would be best), it'd be much appreciated if you
could drop me a line :)

Last thing from me, is date for the next meeting.

Looking at the diary we could try and sort something out for the 2nd
of December if people are up for that, ?


Cheers

Rory
