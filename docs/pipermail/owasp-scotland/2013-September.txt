All,

As promised last Thursday, below are the slides from my presentation.  
I've tidied them up and they should be good to be re-used however you 
want.

There are some hints in the speaker notes on the title slide on how to 
present these if they are being presented, and the other pages have 
links and further info for people if they are being read directly.  Let 
me know if you use them and how it goes!

Thanks,
Andrew
