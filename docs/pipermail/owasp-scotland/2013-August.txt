Subject: [Owasp-scotland] September meeting - 12th
Message-ID: <521118FC.4020400@nmrconsult.net>

Hi all,

Time flys again and we're heading up to the next OWASP Scotland 
meeting.  I thought I'd send out a quick mail on dates now and I'll get 
the eventbrite page sorted later this week.

Date is looking like Thursday 12th September.  We've got one speaker 
confirmed and a slot free at the moment so if anyone has anything they'd 
like to talk about, just let me know!

Cheers

Rory

Hi all,

I've got the eventbrite page up for the september meeting now. Change of 
date to the 19th as it was pointed out to me that 12th clashes with the 
Edinburgh RANT and I'd be making people choose between two sets of free 
refreshments!

http://owaspscotland-september2013.eventbrite.co.uk/ is the eventbrite 
page for sign-ups.  We've got two confirmed talks and a 3rd TBD..


cheers

Rory
