Just to say that I've got the invites up for the meeting on the 28th. We've
got a couple of really interesting talks lined up, and Sopra are sponsoring
the refreshments again so should be a good  one

Hi All,

Just to say that Martin from Edinburgh Uni mentioned another event people
might be interested in.  It's a day looking at ATM and mobile payments
security.  Personally I reckon that NFC will be a very interesting area
going forward given the ubiquity of NFC in the current/next gen mobile
devices.

Anyway more Information/sign-up is here

Hi all,

As it's been a while since I sent out the original invite and we're getting
closer to the date, thought I'd send out a quick reminder about our next
meeting on the 28th.

Details and sign up here
http://owaspscotland-february2013.eventbrite.co.uk/. If you're
thinking of coming along, please do sign up as it helps us get
the right amount of refreshments in :)

Cheers

Rory
