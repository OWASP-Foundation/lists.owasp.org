Conference blurb:

The 2nd International Secure Systems Development Conference (ISSD), Hilton London Olympia London, 18th & 19th May 2011

This years? theme ?Dealing in Tomorrow?s Threats Today ? by Designing Security In?, will be addressed by many leading researchers and experts. Given that a vast majority of today?s vulnerabilities can be traced back to shortcomings in design failures and application coding, this event will provide practical information on Designing Security In.

Code in applications, operating systems, outsourced software, unattended devices (printers, routers, networked CCTV systems, etc) mobile devices, SCADA systems etc. all offer criminals plenty of opportunities to attack individuals, corporations, public sector leaving security professionals with a very challenging future.

The conference is designed to benefit Policy-level, Project and Technical implementation teams responsible for developing secure systems, including Lead Developers, Systems Architects, CISO's, CTO's, Compliance, Risk & Audit Professionals, Government Policymakers and others involved in systems development, designing / protecting new systems in house or managing existing/legacy systems.

Be pro-active, start working Today on Tomorrow?s Threats, by Designing Security In ? don?t leave it until you have an incident!
