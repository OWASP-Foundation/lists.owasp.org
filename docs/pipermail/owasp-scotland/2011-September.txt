I highly recommend Alan's talk on GPS spoofing. I shared an office with
him during our Masters course in the Cambridge Security Group, and he's
a very interesting guy. He had to do this work in lab conditions because
of its potential dangers to aircraft, and it challenges the whole idea
of location based authentication.

It's great stuff for GNURadio and hardware enthusiasts even without the
security aspects...

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] SANS in Scotland
Message-ID: <00b801cc776a$d14d8920$73e89b60$@7elements.co.uk>

Hi,

 

I was going to raise this at the latest OWASP meeting, but we ran a little
late (due to two great talks!).

 

In terms of developing the Scottish security community and doing more in
Scotland, I have become a SANS Mentor with the aim of helping out with
providing more opportunity locally for knowledge transfer and personal
development for security professionals. 

 

As part of this, could I ask what the level of interest would be in people
taking the SANS GCIA certification
(http://www.giac.org/certification/certified-intrusion-analyst-gcia) or in
attending the SANS SEC 503 course
(http://www.sans.org/security-training/intrusion-detection-in-depth-43-mid).


 

 

Or if you know any individuals that would be interested?

 

If there is enough interest then we would be able to look at running a
Scottish based SANS SEC 503 course in either Glasgow or Edinburgh or both!

 

 

 

Regards,

 

David

Message-ID: <CAAG-OzBHxoYPzvq5q_mqioTsO5oyAxFPHsDYiYGtPnWAd8HvvA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just thinking about our next meet-up.  I've checked with David at
Edinburgh University and he's happy to host again, which is great.  So
on that basis how do people feel about a meeting in November.

I was thinking if we went for Thursday 17th or Thursday 24th of
November?  anyone have a particular preference?

also if anyone's got a talk that they'd like to do, or a topic they'd
like to see covered, let me know.  I've got one possible already, but
always happy to hear of more.

Cheers

Rory

Avi Douglen (of the Israel Chapter), and one of the moderators of the Security
StackExchange <http://security.stackexchange.com/> knowledge sharing
site just posted an excellent review of the recent OWASP Israel
Conference<http://security.blogoverflow.com/2011/09/owasp-israel-conference-2011/>on
the Security StackExchange Blog.

Well worth a read - some very interesting topics.

Check out the wider Security StackExchange site as well - loads of info from
policy to technical, from awareness to forensics etc

Regards

Rory
