All,

As noted in the last week's OWASP Scotland chapter meeting, we will be
hosting a joint OWASP/ISACA Scotland fun-packed quiz night with a free
buffet. And no, not all questions will be about Web Application Security
(OWASP) or Information Security Management (ISACA's CISM), so everyone gets
a chance at the prizes!


Come along to the Mercat Bar & Kitchen 28 West Maitland Street, Edinburgh,
EH12 5DX on Thursday 25th October 2018 @ 18:00.


Registration required and tickets are available on Eventbrite:
