<PRE>Morning All,

just a quick recap and a couple of notes I picked up from last nights meeting.

First the list of Metasploit links I promised at the end of my
presentation is here <A HREF="http://wiki.mccune.org.uk/index.php/Metasploit">http://wiki.mccune.org.uk/index.php/Metasploit</A> ,
feel free to add relevant links to it.

Second as a reminder, if anyone's got any contacts at Scottish
universities that they'd be willing to share please drop out a note of
them and we'll see if we can get a decent list together for speaking
to about Application Security education.

For those of you who couldn't make it last night, we're planning
another meeting either at the start or end of August, depending on
speaker/venue availability.  I'll try and drop out some more details
on that as soon as possible.

Anything else I've missed that we need to follow up on?


Cheers

Rory McCune
</PRE>
