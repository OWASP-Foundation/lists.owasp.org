<PRE>Just to confirm - come up to the 5th floor and turn right. The doorman will point you in the right direction if necessary.

I'll be there.

Hi all,

ok looks like all's ok for the 25th June.

Location will be - Ernst &amp; Young, 10 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2
2DZ.  IIRC just come up to the 5th floor and the meeting rooms are
there.

Timings will be :-

Doors open 6:30pm - have a chat and a coffee

Talks start 7:00pm - I'm ok to do 30 minutes on Metasploit, and TBC we
should have some thoughts on the AppSec Europe conference from a
couple of people who made it along.

pub afterwards for anyone who's interested :)

Sound good?

If you could RSVP to the list that'd be great so we've got an idea of numbers.


Cheers

Rory McCune
