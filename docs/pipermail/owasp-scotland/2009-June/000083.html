<PRE>I'll be hungover as it's my birthday on the 24th, but I'll be there.

	&gt;
	&gt; Hi all,
	&gt;
	&gt; Just thinking we should try and get a meet-up setup...  How do
people
	&gt; feel about the end of June sometime?  Once we've got an
agreeable date
	
	&gt; and suggestions for talks would be cool :)
	&gt;
	&gt; One topic, I'd be happy to do something on, if it'd be
interesting is
	&gt; some of the newer features of Metasploit that I've been
looking at
	&gt; recently...
	&gt;
	&gt;
	&gt; Cheers
	&gt;
	&gt;
