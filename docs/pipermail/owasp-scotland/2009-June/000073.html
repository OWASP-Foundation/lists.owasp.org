<PRE>I have tentatively pencilled in the 25th as a date I can get space in 10 
George St. - if folks can confirm that is a useful date, I would certainly 
be interested in more info on your Metasploit 'sploits (been following 
your summaries on your blog)

Subject
[Owasp-scotland] June Meeting?






Hi all,

Just thinking we should try and get a meet-up setup...  How do people
feel about the end of June sometime?  Once we've got an agreeable date
and suggestions for talks would be cool :)

One topic, I'd be happy to do something on, if it'd be interesting is
some of the newer features of Metasploit that I've been looking at
recently...


Cheers


Rory McCune
