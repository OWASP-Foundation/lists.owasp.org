Subject: [Owasp-scotland] February meeting - Now with additional Turbo talks!
Message-ID: <CAAG-OzCxmZyTng78ZXOyAXCcksDPSOPGK+QYSPbfgwzHhhDyNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Just to let you all know in addition to our main talks starting at
7pm, we've also got two "turbo" talks from the guys at Secureworks
covering 0-day discovery and disclosure processes and analysis on
recent cyber attacks.  The turbo talks will be starting at 6:30pm.

cheers

Rory

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Slides from my talk "Experience with Verifying
	Cryptographic Software in C"
Message-ID: <030d01ccefc1$b3dbb9f0$1b932dd0$@ed.ac.uk>

Hi all,

 

I'd a great time at OWASP last Wednesday.  Thanks for all the comments.  And
thanks again to Rory and David for inviting me along.

 

In case you are interested in reviewing the slides, I've put them up here:

http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/adg/Talks/csec-edinburgh-owasp
.pdf 

 

For more info about our project see here:

http://research.microsoft.com/csec 

 

The CryptoForma event I mentioned, is advertised on a tab on this site:

http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/security 

 

Most of the talks will be very research-focused and specialised, but the two
tutorials should be of more general interest.  You are most welcome to
attend.  The detailed schedule should be up in a few days.

 

Hopefully I can make the next OWASP meet up; looking forward to seeing
everyone again.

 

Cheers, Andy

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Any recommendations for evidence gathering legal
 training in Scotland?
Message-ID: <1330425560.2210.7.camel@c4111m>

Hope you don't mind our list being used for a question!

Has anyone been on, or can recommend a good course/book/etc on
understanding the Scottish legal system for evidence gathering?  i.e.
with a particular emphasis on gathering electronic/computer evidence
that can be used in court in Scotland

There seems to be plenty of choice for the England & Wales legal system
but not so for Scotland.  

thanks for any help!

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Schedule for CryptoForma workshop,
	Informatics Forum, Thu/Fri March 1/2
Message-ID: <099b01ccf614$378eb560$a6ac2020$@ed.ac.uk>

Dear friends,

 

At my talk, I mentioned a research workshop we?re holding in the Informatics
Forum this week.

 

The schedule is now up on http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/security and appended
below.

 

You?re all most welcome to attend individual technical sessions at no charge
(but please drop me a note so we know you?re coming).  The short talks are
quite technical and probably only accessible to specialists but I hope the
two tutorials would be generally accessible.

 

Best regards,

 

Andy
