Good, the Bad and the Ugly?.

* Cyber Terror*

Speaker: Tal Mozes

Most of us, cyber security professionals, help in the fighting of
cybercrime.
Most of our threat agents are opportunists, ideologists, organized crime
and other Advanced Adversaries. But between those threat agents there are
also terrorists, which are using the latest technologies to plant terror.
>From information warfare, to targeted attacks, what motivates them, what
can they do and how can we all help in preventing the next digital terror
attack.


* Responsible Disclosure ? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*

Speaker: Rob Jansson

What is responsible disclosure and is it something that would help protect
your company from cyber attack? In this talk we will examine the benefits
of having a responsible disclosure policy in place, what can go wrong and
get ugly (really fast!).
