Hi all,

After some efforts I've managed to arrange a room at Edinburgh Unis
Informatics department on the Thursday 15th September.  So a couple of
points arise.

 - Does that date work ok for people?
 - Does anyone have any particular topics they'd like to either hear
or talk about?  I've got one potentially interesting speaker, just
working on availability, but that still leaves a slot (or maybe 2)
free..  Any thoughts?


Cheers

Rory
