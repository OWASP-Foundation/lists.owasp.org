<PRE>Hi all,

There's a proprosal for an application security stack exchange site
at <A HREF="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431/application-security">http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431/application-security</A>
which has reached the committment phase, which means that they're
looking for people to sign up to contribute to it.

The basic concept of the stack exchange sites comes from one called
Stack overflow <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</A> , they're community Q&amp;A sites
for various topics.  What they're doing at the moment with the Area 51
site is inviting people to propose new sites and then going through a
process of guaging interest before setting them up (the idea being
that there's no point in have a load of these sites that don't get any
use or traffic).

So if anyone's interested, it'd be cool if you sign up and can commit
to contributing.  The sites aren't (in my experience) very spammy and
they don't ask for huge amounts of personal data to sign up (this is
not Experts Exchange) :)  I've used stack overflow a fair bit for
programming questions and it seems like a nice setup, so it'd be cool
to have something like it for application security...

Cheers

Rory
