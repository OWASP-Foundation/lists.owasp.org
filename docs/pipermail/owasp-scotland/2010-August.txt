Hey ?ireann,

Well don't know about everyone else, but I didn't make it through to
Blackhat/Defcon this time.  Thought there was a couple of very interesting
pieces that came out from it though (barnaby Jacks work on ATM machines was
cool and H D Moores VXworks exploits could be interesting in the embedded
space).

A meet-up would be good, just beer or talks + beer...  My availabilities not
great this month + the fringe is on so tourist central! , but I'd definately
be up for something at the start of September, if that works for people...

A couple of questions for the group

 - Could anyone on list offer up a venue, central Edinburgh preferably?

 - Anyone got any specific talks they'd like to do/hear?  If possible I'd
quite like to do something around the application security, as it's been a
while since we did one on that...

Cheers

Rory

I will talk to some friends about a small room we can use, potentially 10
people? If we're larger than that these days then I don't think I have a
venue.

The VXWorks exploits are exactly what you should be expecting in this space.

Barnaby Jack's work interests me too, and I could probably persuade IOActive
back up to talk about it. Chances are it wouldn't be Barnaby himself, but we
can always ask. On a related note my CEO attended BH quietly this year. I
see it as a very good sign...

I think appsec would be great. I'd love some forensics too, especially light
weight beginner stuff.

So, is it out for beers then sometime in August until we have a proper talk
and venue lined up?

How does something on Aug 13th sound?

Yes, forensics stuff sounds like perfect topic for ?ireann's suggestion, Friday
the 13th ;-)

Hi all,

Well can definately try to find an appropriate speaker on Forensics.  In
terms of dates for the talk I was more thinking Thursday 4th or 11th of
September...

On the beers thing, like the idea, that date (13th) doesn't work for me
tho', as I'll be on a ferry to Shetland :)


Cheers

Rory

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Reminder - OWASP Application Security Event -
	September 2010

Re: OWASP Ireland September 17th 2010

Hello,

The agenda has been finalised for the OWASP Ireland event. We have the pleasure to announce a number of key figures from industry which should provide some unique insight into the latest trends, threats and methodologies in the world of application security.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010
Keynotes:

John Viega: ?Application Security in the Real World? - Considerations for AppSec in non-security companies.

John is Executive Vice President of Products and Engineering at Perimeter E-Security. John has authored numerous books on security, including the recent ?Myths of Security?, and the seminal ?Building Secure Software?, which was the first book on application security.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/John_Viega

Professor Fred Piper "The changing face of cryptography"

Fred Piper was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of London in 1975 and has worked in information security since 1979. In 1985, he formed a company, Codes & Ciphers Ltd, which offers consultancy advice in all aspects of information security. He has acted as a consultant to over 80 companies including a number of financial institutions and major industrial companies in the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, South Africa and the USA. The consultancy work has been varied and has included algorithm design and analysis, work on EFTPOS and ATM networks, data systems, security audits, risk analysis and the formulation of security policies. He has lectured worldwide on information security, both academically and commercially, has published more than 100 papers and is joint author of Cipher Systems (1982), one of the first books to be published on the subject of protection of communications, Secure Speech Communications (1985), Digital Signatures - Security & Controls (1999) and Cryptography: A Very Short Introduction (2002).

Damian Gordon Phd: ?Hackers and Hollywood: The Implications of the Popular Media Representation of Computer Hacking"

Damian Gordon is a lecturer with the School of Computing at the Dublin Institute of Technology and is Programme Co-ordinator for the School's Masters in Computing (Assistive Technology). He was primary researcher on two EU funded projects whose particular focus was looking at issues associated with technoacceptance - the ILT and the E4 projects - and was Educational Advisor for the Ireland-China EMERSION project. His research interests include Differentiated Instruction, Computer Security, Technostress, ICT and Special Needs, Virtual Learning Environments, Image reconstruction from specular reflections, and Lateral Thinking Techniques.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Damian_Gordon

We also have some great international and local speakers covering topics from Smart phone application security to SDLC to Penetration testing techniques:
?         Dan Cornell ("Smart Phones with Dumb Apps")
?         Ryan Berg ("Path to a Secure Application")
?         Dr Marian Ventunaec ("Testing the Enterprise E-mail Security - from Software to Cloud-based Services")
?         Fred Donovan and (?Counter Intelligence as Defense???)
?         Nick Coblentz (?Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle???) but to name a few

Training:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010#Training

Secure application development training shall also be held on the 16th (day prior to the event):

?Secure Application Development: Writing secure code (and testing it)?

Testing shall be delivered by Eoin Keary, OWASP board member and ?The OWASP Code Review Guide? (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project) Lead & Rahm Jina, Senior consultant with Ernst & Young.

This intensive one-day course focuses on the most common web application security problems, including aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten (2010) and the MITRE Top 25.  The course will introduce and demonstrate application assessment techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities in their code, covering of the following areas:

Unvalidated Input
Injection Flaws
Cross-Site Scriping
CSRF
Authentication & Session Management
Access control & Authorisation
Broken Caching
Error Handling
Cryptography
Resource Management
Rich Internet Applications & Webservices
The Secure SDLC

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Application Security Stack Exchange Site
Message-ID: <AANLkTimey=yocM-Q1BeNZC9Oz+0-SjRXP+sE_4TwSobh@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

There's a proprosal for an application security stack exchange site
at http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431/application-security
which has reached the committment phase, which means that they're
looking for people to sign up to contribute to it.

The basic concept of the stack exchange sites comes from one called
Stack overflow http://stackoverflow.com/ , they're community Q&A sites
for various topics.  What they're doing at the moment with the Area 51
site is inviting people to propose new sites and then going through a
process of guaging interest before setting them up (the idea being
that there's no point in have a load of these sites that don't get any
use or traffic).

So if anyone's interested, it'd be cool if you sign up and can commit
to contributing.  The sites aren't (in my experience) very spammy and
they don't ask for huge amounts of personal data to sign up (this is
not Experts Exchange) :)  I've used stack overflow a fair bit for
programming questions and it seems like a nice setup, so it'd be cool
to have something like it for application security...

Cheers

Rory
