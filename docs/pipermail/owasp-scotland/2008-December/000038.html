Hi all,

Has tonight's OWASP meeting been canceled? One of my colleagues highlighted the fact that the OWASP Scotland page said &quot;Unfortunately due to some logistical problems the meeting on the 4th won't be going ahead. We'll be looking to sort something out in the new year &quot;. 

Is this a new update; if so did an email go out to the OWASP email list? I didn't get one...


Cheers,
Rob

Hi all, 

Looks like a lot of people have got challenges around the date of the 27th, including our prospective speaker!

So the thought is rather than rush into a date which not everyone can make we should pick a date slightly further out and give people lots of notice...

So the new date/location/speaker is

Date - Thursday 4th December
Location - Gogarburn House, Edinburgh (It's on the RBS campus, next to the airport)
Speaker - Dinis Cruz, who'll be giving an update on OWASPs plan for 2009, following the OWASP EU summit in November.

Hopefully that'll work well for people...


Cheers


Rory
