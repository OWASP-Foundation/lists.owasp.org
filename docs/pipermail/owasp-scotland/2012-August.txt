Hi All,

Seems like summer has flown in (although that may just be the lack of
Summery weather!)  Anyway got the date and speakers sorted for the
next OWASP meeting.  Colin Cassidy and Neil Campbell have agreed to do
the talks and the Eventbrite page is
http://owaspscotland-september2012.eventbrite.co.uk/ , if you're
thinking of coming along, if you can sign-up there that'd be great as
it helps to keep me straight on the numbers for refreshments...

Date - Wednesday 19th of September
Location - Open Area - 8th Floor, School of Informatics, The
University of Edinburgh, EH8 9LE

Look forward to seeing everyone there!

Cheers

Rory
