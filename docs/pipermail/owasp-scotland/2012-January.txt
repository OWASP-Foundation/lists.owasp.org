Hi All,

Just finalised some details for the Febrary 2012 meeting, now mostly
sorted.  We've got a couple of interesting talks lined up from Andrew
Gordon of Microsoft/Edinburgh University and ?ireann Leverett who's
offered to come and tell us about his research into critical
infrastructure security.

Details and sign-up here http://owaspscotland-feb2012.eventbrite.co.uk/


Cheers

Rory
