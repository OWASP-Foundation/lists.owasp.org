<PRE>Hello I would just like to introduce myself to this mailing list.

 

My name is Danny and I run a company called Aerovision IT, based in
Cupar, Fife (yes we actually have the internet there).

 

I am interested in OWASP as our business conducts Penetration Testing
against a range of Servers and Networks, including Websites and Web
Servers.

 

We also manage and support dedicated Web Servers for larger companies
(including government departments) and therefore have a keen interest in
their security.

 

Anyway, if anyone would like to chat then please feel free to email me,

 

Thank you,

 

Danny Clark

Technical Manager
