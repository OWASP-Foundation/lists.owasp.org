Subject: [Owasp-scotland] November Meeting
Message-ID: <527B72C7.2030307@nmrconsult.net>

Hi all,

That's us sorted for the November meeting.  We've got talks from Colin 
on SCADA security and my delayed talk on mobile.

Sign-up is on Eventbrite as per usual 
http://owaspscotland-november-2013.eventbrite.co.uk/ feel free to 
tweet/share/e-mail/publicise via smoke signals..

In addition to the talks this time, It'd be good to have a quick chat on 
the chapter itself so I'll set aside 10 mins for that.

Cheers

Rory

All, 

 

Just an update on last quarter's talk from me - the slides have finally
slithered their way on to the internets.  Link below.

 

See you on the 28th.

 

Andrew 

 

PS I'll be heading over to the peartree after the talks if anyone else
fancies a pint?

Andrew

 

I added the presentation to the project page.

 

There is a new section under translations called "Related Presentations"

Does that look okay?
