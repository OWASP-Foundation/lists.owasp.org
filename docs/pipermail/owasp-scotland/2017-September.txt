*Revocation is broken, here's how we're fixing it*

*Speaker*: Scott Helme

The certificates we obtain from a Certificate Authority underpin trust on
the web. The problem is that if we lose the key for our certificate an
attacker can use that certificate to successfully impersonate us for as
long as it's valid, potentially years. We need a way to revoke the trust in
these certificates so that they can't be abused but all current revocation
mechanisms are largely useless. Let's look at the new mechanisms being
introduced to address the problem of revocation.
