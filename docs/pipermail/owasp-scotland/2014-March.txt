Hi all,

So at the last meeting, I mentioned that as I'm now based way out on the
West coast, I was looking for someone to take over on arranging meetings in
Edinburgh.  Fortunately Lex Sobrinho has stepped in to take on that side of
things, so he'll be running OWASP meetings in Edinburgh and I'm handling
stuff on the west coast.


We've got some meetings lined up with details coming out real soon now!

Cheers

Rory

Hi All,

Following up on the mail yesterday, I've got the meeting page up for the
Scotland West first meeting here
http://owaspwestscotland-feb2014.eventbrite.co.uk

We've got an interesting talk from Rab about Active X, and as it's the
first meeting in Glasgow, I'm planning to give a bit of a talk on OWASP
projects that people can use now and how to get involved with OWASP.

Please feel free to forward/tweet/etc as I'm sure there's people in the
west who might be interested but haven't made it across to Edinburgh in the
past.

Cheers

Rory

hi there,

Could you please share the attached leaflet at universities and third level
institutions? We are in the lookout of potential students to work on OWASP
projects during the Google Summer of Code.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks and regards,

Fabio
