I recently did the CEH cert and my impressions of the course was as follows:
* Good overview of  technologies
* Fair use of tools, however, some of the tools provided are outdated 
and is supposed to give you start.
* Excellent practical tests, this does not go into the darkest depths, 
but it is good enough to give you enough experience to get an overall 
feeling of what the topics are about.
* Quite expensive

Rory: why is the CEH not well regarded as opposed to the others? I can 
see that the Offensive Security courses are a lot harder.
