<PRE>Hi Paul,

hmm interesting question.  There's quite a few certs in the
Information security world, most of which are pretty specialised, so
to an extent it depends on what area of security you're interested in.

For general Infosec positions the CISSP goes down well with HR types,
but it's only open to people with a certain number of years of
industry experience.  They do have a cert the SSCP
(<A HREF="http://www.isc2.org/sscp/default.aspx">http://www.isc2.org/sscp/default.aspx</A> ) which is more geared to
people getting into the InfoSec industry, but it's not as well known.

On the more technical side, in my experience there's less clarity on
what the best certs are.  For pen. testing the CREST certs are well
regarded in the industry, but then again they're more targeted at
people who've been working in that area for a while.  the CEH is
reasonably well known but isn't always well regarded...

At the end of the day I'd say that the act of having taken the
initiative and studied / taken the exam  for most certs. would be seen
as a plus by most employers, although it doesn't always help get past
HR if they're looking for specific &quot;keywords&quot;.

HTH

Cheers

Rory
