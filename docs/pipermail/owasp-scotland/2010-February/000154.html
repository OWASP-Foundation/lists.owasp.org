</I>Hi.

Hmm well I guess it probably got a bit of a rep. due to being a
multiple-choice based test.

There's a risk with that kind of test that the person taking it has
just memorized all the facts needed to pass the exam without actually
understanding the material or how to apply it.  It got really common
back in the day for Microsoft/Novell exams where there were a lot of
paper MCSE/CNEs around who had exam crammed all the certifications but
had limited real experience.

To be honest some of the other certs (eg, CISSP) get the same kind of
reputation, it's kind of a risk for any examination where it has a
multi-choice format, I reckon that's one of the reasons for the CISSP
that they introduced the experience requirement...

Cheers

Rory
