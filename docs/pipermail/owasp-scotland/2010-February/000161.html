<PRE>Hi all,

Looks like we've got good numbers for 4th March (well assuming the
snow goes away by then and people can get into Edinburgh!)

Speakers are going to be &#201;ireann and my good self.   Kick off at
6:30pm, Ernst &amp; Young 10 George Street Edinburgh EH2 2DZ.

What I was planning to do was give everyone an update on what OWASP as
an organisation is up to at the minute.  There's quite a lot going on
and some of it people from the Scottish chapter might want to be
involved in.  Also I'd be interested to solicit any ideas for what
people reckon would be good for OWASP Scotland to get involved in...

I'll update the OWASP scotland chapter page wiki with some more
details shortly, but any questions in the mean time , just shout.


See you all next week.


Cheers

Rory
</PRE>
