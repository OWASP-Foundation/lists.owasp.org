<PRE>Agree with the previous points, and from a big firm perspective, the 
highly regarded ones also include pretty much anything from SANS.  Sadly 
the large corporates seem to dislike the Offensive Security ones, and I'm 
betting this is entirely down to the name/marketing, but they do have a 
good rep with pen testers

CEH is a good foot in the door, and quite quick and easy to get through 
but focuses heavily on tools, so self study on methodology would be key.

CISSP or SSCP are a reasonable way into wider infosec, but not really 
applicable to pen testing. In addition, for big firms, they don't test 
experience (can be bootcamped) so are more an entry level or junior cert 
and not considered very deep.

The Cisco security certs are also quite relevant for infrastructure 
security.

Cheers

Rory

Re: [Owasp-scotland] Low Cost Training






One of my penetration testers took the offensive security exams and 
gave them the thumbs up. He said the content was thorough and relevant 
so I would go for them as a training tool. Unfortunately, Rory is 
right. Some are better known but lesser regarded as it's down to the 
marketing machines they have.

I would start with the O.S. courses and see about CISSP or SSCP. CEH 
is worth doing only because of the HR process knowing shag all about 
pen testing and looking for that buzzword. CREST will be out of your 
league in terms of cost (&#163;1600 to sit the exam I think) and experience 
(Rory, I hear you are prepping for the app exam, is that right? Me 
too, in which case we should get our heads together and help each 
other study?)


Back to the subject, if you can wangle a few months internship at a 
consultancy then that will really help kick start your career. Have a 
look around.

&gt;<i> Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> hmm interesting question.  There's quite a few certs in the
</I>&gt;<i> Information security world, most of which are pretty specialised, so
</I>&gt;<i> to an extent it depends on what area of security you're interested in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For general Infosec positions the CISSP goes down well with HR types,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's only open to people with a certain number of years of
</I>&gt;<i> industry experience.  They do have a cert the SSCP
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.isc2.org/sscp/default.aspx">http://www.isc2.org/sscp/default.aspx</A> ) which is more geared to
</I>&gt;<i> people getting into the InfoSec industry, but it's not as well known.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the more technical side, in my experience there's less clarity on
</I>&gt;<i> what the best certs are.  For pen. testing the CREST certs are well
</I>&gt;<i> regarded in the industry, but then again they're more targeted at
</I>&gt;<i> people who've been working in that area for a while.  the CEH is
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably well known but isn't always well regarded...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the end of the day I'd say that the act of having taken the
</I>&gt;<i> initiative and studied / taken the exam  for most certs. would be seen
</I>&gt;<i> as a plus by most employers, although it doesn't always help get past
</I>&gt;<i> HR if they're looking for specific &quot;keywords&quot;.
