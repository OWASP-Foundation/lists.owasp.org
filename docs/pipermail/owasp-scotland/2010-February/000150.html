<PRE>Hi all,

so some more potential details for meeting on the 4th.  We've got the
venue confirmed at our usual spot at EY's offices on George Street,
courtesy of Rory Alsop.

In terms of talks &#201;ireann Leverett has offered to do a talk on
Industrial control system security, and also I thought it might be
worth my covering some of what's been happening in the OWASP world
recently.

It'd be good if people could reply back either to the list or over to
me so we can get a feel for whether this date works for people or if
we'd be better moving to a later date....

Also if anyone else is keen to do a talk let me know :)


Cheers

rory
