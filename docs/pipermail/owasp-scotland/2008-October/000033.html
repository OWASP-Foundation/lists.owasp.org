Great.  The deadline is Friday 17th.  Shall we exchange sugegstions by email and prepare a draft by Wednesday, which we can then post to the London and Scotland lists?  And then make a final submission on Thursday?

My suggestion is we send a very short, focused reply with a few suggested wording changes or additions, purely related to security.  All the other things such as choice of browsers is being commented on by many other groups and individuals.
