<PRE>Hi all,

Just forwarding on an invite, in case anyone's not seen it, to the
next couple of Risk and Network Threat forums that SecureTest run.  If
you're interested in going along to either of their events, please
RSVP to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-scotland">neil.boyd at securetest.com.</A>

Both events open at 5:30pm with the speaker starting at 6:30pm

cheers

Rory

--
Due to the Caledonian Alehouse being demolished to make way for a tram
terminus we have had to find a new home for the RANT on the 27th
March.

The RANT will be held at the Mercat Bar, West Maitland Street near
Haymarket Station.

We are also delighted to announce another &quot;Bonus RANT&quot; to be held at
the same venue on 15th April.  The guest speaker at this one is Ed
Gibson, Chief Security Advisor to Microsoft.  One not to be missed!!

I have attached an updated invitation for both of these events and
hope that you will be able to come along to them.

Please RSVP for both the 27th March and 15th April RANTS.



Kind regards,

Neil Boyd
