<PRE>The next meeting will be held at the Hilton Grosvoner on February 28th
starting at 7pm. We have secured Dr Steven Moyle as the Guest Speaker.
Details on Steve and his presentation can be found below. I have sat in
on one of Steve's presentations at RSA and they are extremely
informative and dynamic.

 

Could you RSVP to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-scotland">jwood at fortifysoftware.com.</A>

 

Look forward to seeing you soon.

Title: &quot;Databases: A class break by design! Is there a class defense?&quot;

 

Abstract: 

 

&quot;The  very foundation principles of relational databases combined with
their complexity and ubiquity make them delicately poised to explode
sensitive data across the Internet. The trigger is  applications
developed insensitively to the class breaks in the  databases beneath.
Can applications be developed with security to mitigate against these
vulnerabilities? Are there any class defenses  available?&quot;

 

Biographical sketch: 

 

&quot;Steve Moyle is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Secerno -
the database security company out of Oxford.  He has a diverse
background.  His early career was in process engineering for heavy
industry, working for Comalco Aluminium (now part of the Rio Tinto
group).  He then focused on process automation and computer control
systems - first for Comalco, and then for Honeywell Control Systems.  He
designed and engineered computer monitoring and control systems for
not-normally-manned North Sea gas platforms for Total &amp; Conoco. An
interest in data mining drew him into research at the Oxford University
Computing Laboratory where he spent the next decade.   After obtaining
his doctorate in symbolic machine learning Steve continued his research
at Oxford.
His research results in machine learning found a powerful fit in the
field of computer security.  Steve has built the team of people at
Secerno to embed these techniques into the company's range of database
security products.&quot;
