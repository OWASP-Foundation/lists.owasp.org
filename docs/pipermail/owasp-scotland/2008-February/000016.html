<PRE>Hi all,

 

Could the attendance sheet be stored electronically on the OWASP
(Scotland) site instead of having to keep hold of your own copy (which
I'm bound to lose, or the dog might eat it!)?

 

It would be good if ISC would just take an attendance list straight from
OWASP with the CISSP numbers on it and automatically bump up your
points, but they are still doing a paper based exam which then has to be
posted to America to be put through a scanner so I doubt they can manage
this height of technical supremacy!

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] OWASP chapter meeting attendance count
towardsCISSP CPE points

 

Dear All,

 

As an added incentive you may not be aware that attending local meetings
counts towards CISSP CPR Points. Details below;

 

Regards,

 

 

John D Wood

 

OWASP chapter meeting attendance count towards CISSP CPE points

1 hour = 1 CPE point

 

Procedure:

1) You provide an attendance sheet, such as
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Chapter_Attendance_Sheet.doc">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Chapter_Attendance_Sheet.doc</A>

To be filled in by CISSP's during the meeting.

 

2) Afterwards the chapter leader signs the sheet and sends a scan back.

 

3) Each CISSP does claim their own points and has this sheet as proof if
challenged.

 

PS: maybe we could ask ISC2 to automate this based on cissp # ?

Anybody has contact to get this ball rolling?

 

Regards

 

Seba
