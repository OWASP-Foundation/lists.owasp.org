Hi all,

I've had a couple of nudges on the subject of sorting out the next
meeting (perils of being busy!).

So the date for the diaries is Wednesday 6th June. I'll get an
eventbrite page sorted out shortly.

In the meantime, if anyone would like to present, drop me a line.


Cheers

Rory

Hi All,

The Eventbrite site for the June meeting is up here
http://owaspscotland-june2012.eventbrite.co.uk/ , so if you're
planning to come along please sign up here.  We also have a facebook
page here thanks to the Abertay crowd
https://www.facebook.com/events/387025758002993/ .

Two talks confirmed so far with a potential third to be confirmed.
Lee's offered to reprise his talk from Infosec on APT and I've got a
(hopefully) interesting talk on comparisons of White and black box
scanning tools for web app testing.

Cheers

Rory
