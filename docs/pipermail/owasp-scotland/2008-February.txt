Message-ID: <B29D9690D12B0A488FCFF65AB84FCE637A9C12@SAHARA.fortifysoftware.com>

The next meeting will be held at the Hilton Grosvoner on February 28th
starting at 7pm. We have secured Dr Steven Moyle as the Guest Speaker.
Details on Steve and his presentation can be found below. I have sat in
on one of Steve's presentations at RSA and they are extremely
informative and dynamic.

 

Could you RSVP to jwood at fortifysoftware.com.

 

Look forward to seeing you soon.

Title: "Databases: A class break by design! Is there a class defense?"

 

Abstract: 

 

"The  very foundation principles of relational databases combined with
their complexity and ubiquity make them delicately poised to explode
sensitive data across the Internet. The trigger is  applications
developed insensitively to the class breaks in the  databases beneath.
Can applications be developed with security to mitigate against these
vulnerabilities? Are there any class defenses  available?"

 

Biographical sketch: 

 

"Steve Moyle is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Secerno -
the database security company out of Oxford.  He has a diverse
background.  His early career was in process engineering for heavy
industry, working for Comalco Aluminium (now part of the Rio Tinto
group).  He then focused on process automation and computer control
systems - first for Comalco, and then for Honeywell Control Systems.  He
designed and engineered computer monitoring and control systems for
not-normally-manned North Sea gas platforms for Total & Conoco. An
interest in data mining drew him into research at the Oxford University
Computing Laboratory where he spent the next decade.   After obtaining
his doctorate in symbolic machine learning Steve continued his research
at Oxford.
His research results in machine learning found a powerful fit in the
field of computer security.  Steve has built the team of people at
Secerno to embed these techniques into the company's range of database
security products."

Hi all,

 Just forwarding on an invite, in case anyone's not seen it, to the
 next couple of Risk and Network Threat forums that SecureTest run.  If
 you're interested in going along to either of their events, please
 RSVP to neil.boyd at securetest.com.

 Both events open at 5:30pm with the speaker starting at 6:30pm

 cheers

 Due to the Caledonian Alehouse being demolished to make way for a tram
 terminus we have had to find a new home for the RANT on the 27th
 March.

 The RANT will be held at the Mercat Bar, West Maitland Street near
 Haymarket Station.

 We are also delighted to announce another "Bonus RANT" to be held at
 the same venue on 15th April.  The guest speaker at this one is Ed
 Gibson, Chief Security Advisor to Microsoft.  One not to be missed!!

 I have attached an updated invitation for both of these events and
 hope that you will be able to come along to them.

 Please RSVP for both the 27th March and 15th April RANTS.



 Kind regards,

 Neil Boyd

Message-ID: <B29D9690D12B0A488FCFF65AB84FCE637E50CE@SAHARA.fortifysoftware.com>

Dear All,

 

As an added incentive you may not be aware that attending local meetings
counts towards CISSP CPR Points. Details below;

 

Regards,

 

 

John D Wood

 

OWASP chapter meeting attendance count towards CISSP CPE points

1 hour = 1 CPE point

 

Procedure:

1) You provide an attendance sheet, such as
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Chapter_Attendance_Sheet.doc

To be filled in by CISSP's during the meeting.

 

2) Afterwards the chapter leader signs the sheet and sends a scan back.

 

3) Each CISSP does claim their own points and has this sheet as proof if
challenged.

 

PS: maybe we could ask ISC2 to automate this based on cissp # ?

Anybody has contact to get this ball rolling?

 

Regards

 

Seba

Hi all,

 

Could the attendance sheet be stored electronically on the OWASP
(Scotland) site instead of having to keep hold of your own copy (which
I'm bound to lose, or the dog might eat it!)?

 

It would be good if ISC would just take an attendance list straight from
OWASP with the CISSP numbers on it and automatically bump up your
points, but they are still doing a paper based exam which then has to be
posted to America to be put through a scanner so I doubt they can manage
this height of technical supremacy!

Moyle the CTO and Founder from Secerno speaking on hacking databases. 

 

For those who are attending would it be possible for you to confirm so I

Database Hacking and Prevention tonight at The Hilton Grosvenor at 7pm.

 

Steve is a world authority on this subject and it should be a very
interesting talk and point of learning and awareness.
