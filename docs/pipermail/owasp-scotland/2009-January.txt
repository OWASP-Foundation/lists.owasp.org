Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Update on COI Browser Standards for Public Websites
Message-ID: <b46e4cdd0901291257t3322aad4k8de39f1f405e7cf4@mail.gmail.com>

Last October, we submitted a response to the draft "Browser Standards
for Public Websites" from the Central Office of Information (COI).

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London#Other_Activities
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Scotland#Other_Activities

The final version (1.0) was issued earlier this month:

http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=212
http://www.coi.gov.uk/documents/guidance/browser-testing-guidelines-v1-0.pdf

and has now been renamed to "Browser Testing Guidelines".  It seems
our suggestions have not been incorporated into the new slimmer
document.  The only related change seems to have been "Browser
security testing" being added as out of scope to the Introduction
(page 2).

Thanks to everyone who helped.  We can continue to try to influence
standards, policies and legislation.

Regards

Colin
