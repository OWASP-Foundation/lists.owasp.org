[UK list cross-post - sorry if I missed any chapter out]

The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has opened a
consultation on the proposed security requirements for smart meter
systems, due to be rolled out from 2014 to 2019. The consultation is
at:

  http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/consultation/smart-meters-security-risk-assess/5434-cons-smart-meters-security-risk-assess.pdf

It mentions "good practices", "ISO 27001" and includes a definition of
"secure". It asks three open questions:

* Do you consider that the draft licence conditions deliver the policy
intention outlined in this document? Please provide comments on where
the drafting could be amended or clarified.

* Do you have any comments on the proposed approach that suppliers
should carry out a number of good practice security disciplines and
procedures as is set out in this document?

* Do you have any further comments with regard to the issues raised in
this document? We also welcome general comments around the approach to
small suppliers, the processes expected of suppliers in general, and
any related costs.

Maybe OWASP's UK chapters would like to collaboratively submit a
response? I am happy to coordinate. If anyone is interested please
contact me directly or via these lists. The consultation closes on
27th July.

Thanks Tobias. The risks to parties other than the energy provider is
an important point.

Some other people have replied directly too, so I will wait and see
who else is interested and then re-contact everyone.
