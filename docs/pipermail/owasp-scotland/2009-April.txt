List,

An informal meeting of Scotland's OWASP list is getting together for face to
face introductions, a chance to have a laugh, and discuss setting up the
chapter more formally. We're meeting this Thursday in Edinburgh at All Bar
One (Festival SQ) 6:00PM. 
I'll make a little sign that says OWASP and put it on the table.
Looking forward to seeing you folks,
?ireann

Hi all,

After the chat last week, thought it'd be worth sorting out a date for
a "proper" meeting.  How would week commencing 11th May work?  Main
things to get sorted would be a venue and speaker/topic, so any
suggestions/offers would be great.


Cheers

Hello Rory

That week might be difficult for people going to:

   OWASP AppSec Europe 2009
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2009_-_Poland

although all the bank holidays make May awkward anyway!
