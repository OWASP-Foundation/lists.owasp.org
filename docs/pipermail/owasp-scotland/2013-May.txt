Hi all,

Time for the next OWASP meeting. We're looking at the 30th of May for this
one.  Eventbrite page is up here
http://owaspscotlandmay2013.eventbrite.co.uk/ .  Looks like we've got three
talks lined up including one from Colin McLean from Abertay Uni. I'll fill
in more detail when I get them but feel free to grab tickets now.

Cheers

Rory
