First of all I would like to thanks you all for attending the first
meeting (and hopefully the mailing list is working.....)

 

The next OWASP meeting will feature another guest speaker - John
McDonnell from CESG/GCHQ. The meeting venue will be at the Hilton
Caledonian on Wednesday 12th December. Further details can be found at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Scotland I will be updating the site
later this week with further details on the talk.

 

At the next meeting I will also outline the schedule for next year and
update the group on the latest OWASP news and initiatives.

 

Look forward to seeing you soon.
