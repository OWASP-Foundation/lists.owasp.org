Hi all,

I mentioned this to a couple of people at the meeting, but thought I'd
drop out a link.

http://shodan.surtri.com/

Basically a search engine for banners from scans of HTTP/Telnet/FTP
servers.  Shows up some interesting things

http://shodan.surtri.com/?q=jetdirect - printers online
http://shodan.surtri.com/?q=camera+%22200+OK%22 - Webcams with open access
http://shodan.surtri.com/?q=port%3A23+%22list+of+built-in+commands%22
- Even logged in telnet shells!

They've disabled the net: filter at the moment which is a shame as it
was an easy no-touch way of assessing a netblock for some potential
issues...


cheers

Rory

Thanks Rory,

I remember you mentioning it, but was too busy to hunt it down. I look
forward to checking this out at length.

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] UK ICO - Consultation on the Personal Information
	Online Code of Practice
Message-ID: <b46e4cdd0912110824l6a101361g9f98b1199bfcaca5@mail.gmail.com>

Dear UK Chapters

This week, the Information Commissioner's Office launched their
consultation process for the Personal Information Online Code of
Practice.  The OWASP Industry Committee is coordinating an official
response from OWASP and would be pleased to receive any suggestions or
comments for inclusion.

This is not a technical document, and is most likely to be read in
organisations without their own security, compliance or data
protection staff.  Some extracts from page 7 of the draft document:

   "...build in security and privacy from the very start..."
   "...if your website offers auto-completion..."
   "...review your security arrangements on a regular basis..."
   "... assess the risks of a security breach..."

Further details at:

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Personal_Information_Online_Code_of_Practice

If you have any comments, perhaps email them to me directly, and we
will create a draft response and circulate that.

Regards

Colin Watson
Global Industry Committee
