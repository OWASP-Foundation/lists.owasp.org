Hi All,

With the start of the new year, the Scotland OWASP leaders would like to
get the Scotland OWASP Chapter up and running again. To get things kicked
off we will be holding a virtual session.

Details of the session are as follows:

   - Date: TBC (likely towards the end of February/early March)
   - Session Access Information: TBD
   - Speaker: TBD
   - Topic: TBD

The idea is to have these sessions on a periodic basis (likely a monthly or
bimonthly basis).

If you have any topics which you would like to talk about, please feel free
to reach out to myself or Rob and we will try accommodate you as best as we
possibly can.

Regards,
Sean Wright

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Glasgow Meetups
Message-ID: <75233a4f-b8f0-185e-fcf6-898de1e1f12c@pentest.co.uk>

Hello Owaspers,

I am interested in working to put a regular in-person event together in
Glasgow. I think one per quarter. My reasons for this are because
Edinburgh has a pretty decent list of Cyber Security meetups already
whereas Glasgow basically seems to have Glasgow Defcon
(https://twitter.com/DC44141). Which meets monthly at the Raven on the
first Tuesday of every month. You should all try to get along, it is great!

Glasgow as a city has a lot of software developers and increasingly they
are aware of OWASP but have not heard of "defcon". So I think using
OWASP is a better name to set-up an event under than any other. It will
let us provide awareness to the wider community.

I am suggesting capture the flag style events or "Secure coding"
workshop style meetups once a quarter as a good way to build the
community here.

Regards
