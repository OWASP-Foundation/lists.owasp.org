Hi All,

It was good to see such a great turnout at the first OWASP event in Glasgow
a few weeks ago.

Morgan Stanley are currently looking to hire an Incident Response Analyst
to join our CERT team based in Glasgow headquarters (located in the City
Centre). You can find more details and apply for the job by searching for
job number 3020668 and completing the online application process via:
http://www.morganstanley.com/about/careers/careersearch.html

Looking forward to hearing from potential candidates and hope to see you
all at the next meeting.

Best Regards,

Paul McCreath

I apologise. It seems this email is not from a recruiter and was
pre-approved, and I defer to the mailing list owner.

Hi All,

Just to confirm, yep Paul asked me about this and I approved the posting.

2 reasons really, it's a non agency posting that's right in the area where
list members might be interested.

Also review of the recent OWASP-leaders discussion on commercial postings
seemed to have the consensus that non-agency job postings are fine.

Happy to hear if people have specific concerns, and obv. we could review
this if it looked like it was becoming an issue (the list is pretty low
volume at the mo' so hopefully that won't become a problem.)


Cheers

Rory
