<PRE>9th does sound good, I'll get that in the calendar.

And Edinburgh works best for me that week.

Cheers

Ok,
 
How does the 9th of April sound? It's the Thursday before the Easter hols, 
which means it's not a school night. 
 
I know three of us are in Edinburgh, does that suit the rest of you?
 
We can argue over pubs once we've settled on a city :)

Before this list gets revived formally, is anyone interested in meeting 
for an informal beer in April sometime?
