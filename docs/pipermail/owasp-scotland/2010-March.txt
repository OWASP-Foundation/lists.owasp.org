To last night's attendees,

Thanks a lot for coming along to my talk, I really appreciated the interest
in the subject matter. Shailendra got safely away this morning and said he
was quite pleased to represent Cambridge's Security Lab up here, and that
you all took an interest in and understood the economics of the
(in)Security. I look forward to attending one of your talks next time :)

I realise my talk was light on technical detail, but I'm sure you can
understand why. If you are interested in the subject, please feel free to
e-mail me, and we can discuss specific areas that might apeal to whatever
specialty you already have. There's plenty of work for everyone.

Lastly, I am interested in doing this talk (or variants of it) in other
places, to get more people interested in industrial system security and CNI.
If you know of any groups that would be interested, please let me know.

?ireann

@Fiona I'd love to come out to Ireland for example...I haven't been to
Dublin since I was a kid...

Incidentally, just in case you thought my talk wasn't quite in the OWASP
remit. This article (that came out while we were speaking) ought to help
explain why OWASP should become more interested...

After all, it's OUR infrastructure.

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] Meeting Notes and Follow-ups
Message-ID: <5230459f1003070824q63df4c5qc08c54119603185f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a quick note following on from the meeting on Thursday.

First off I'd like to thank ?ireann and Shailendra for the talks, very
interesting (if a bit scary to think about too much :) )

Some links to the stuff I talked about.

OWASP Application security verification standard can be found here -
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project.

The Global Connections committee homepage is here -
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Connections_Committee.

On the connections committee side of things, if anyone knows of a
group who you think would be interested in a presentation on Web
application security, be that professional bodies like th BCS,
educational groups or business groups, post it up on the list and we
can see if we can sort something out.  I think there was general
agreement that it'd be good for us to do some work on connecting with
people outside of the immediate security community and an introductory
talk would seem like a good way to start.

On dates for meetings, I've lined up some dates below at 2 month
intervals, going for the first Thursday of the month, do these seem ok
for everyone?

Dates

Thursday 6th May
Thursday 1st July
Thursday 2nd September
Thursday 4th November

Also as discussed, if anyone's got a talk they'd like to do, or a
topic they'd like to hear a talk on, let me know.

Cheers

Rory

Hi Rory,

First Thursdays sounds good. I vote Aye. [?]

Cheers,
Tyn

Subject: [Owasp-scotland] A comedy comment from PHP,
	and a request for forensics reading 	material...
Message-ID: <l2m7a84374e1003310548r45fcc40cif094d89e6e938a83@mail.gmail.com>

Found in PHP PRNG code by a security researcher:

/* Add entropy to s2 by calling gettimeofday() again */

How is OWASP Scotland today?

Could some of our more Forensics minded folks recommend some resources for
me?

Books, articles, or mailing lists that provide an overview would be a great
start, but perhaps a light introduction to tools and general legal issues.

Alternatively, I offer pints for sit down discussions :)

Lastly, is anyone going for training at SANS or attending INFOSec Europe?
