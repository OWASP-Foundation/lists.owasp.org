Hi all,

We're planning the next meeting on This Wednesday at the Caledonian
Hotel in Edinburgh (same place as the October meeting).  Sorry for the
short notice.  Any replies on people being able to make it (or not)
appreciated so we can gauge attendance.  the plan is to have a
presentation on "Penetration Testing: Hazardous to your Security?"
which I'm hoping will generate some intereting debate.

Hi Rory,

Just replying for attendance count - a collegue will come along as well.

There is no time noted - what time were you thinking?

Hi Rory.

I don't think I will make it along to Wednesday's session unfortunately 
(due to domestic duties in the early evenings at the moment!). I'm 
interested in the subject of the talk and also in discussing some of the 
points you make on your blog so it would be good to meet up some other 
time.

All,

Change of venue!

Sorry for the late notice, but apparently there's been a problem
getting into the Caledonian so we've moved to the grosvenor (fairly
nearby)

Grosvenor Street
Edinburgh
EH12 5EF
