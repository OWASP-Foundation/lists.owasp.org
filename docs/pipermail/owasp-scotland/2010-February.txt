Hi all,

How's it going?

I was thinking it's been a while since we've had an OWASP meeting, so
we should remedy that!.  How are people placed for Thursday 4th March?

Location and speakers, to be confirmed.  If anyone's got a talk they'd
like to do let me know :)


Cheers

Rory

Hi. This is my first post to the list so hope I haven't mussed it up.

I am a student studying in Glasgow and expect to have some time towards 
the end of the year to dedicate to 'personal' studies. I have a keen 
interest in InfoSec and would like to earn some kind of certification. 
Unfortunately, most of the courses I have seen are way to expensive and 
don't offer an exams-only option.

The courses offered by Offensive Security seem quite thorough and 
reasonably priced (they may consider a discount for students) but I 
wonder what value their certifications would have in the eyes of HR?

http://www.offensive-security.com/certifications.php

Any thoughts on the best way to go?
Paul

Hi all,

so some more potential details for meeting on the 4th.  We've got the
venue confirmed at our usual spot at EY's offices on George Street,
courtesy of Rory Alsop.

In terms of talks ?ireann Leverett has offered to do a talk on
Industrial control system security, and also I thought it might be
worth my covering some of what's been happening in the OWASP world
recently.

It'd be good if people could reply back either to the list or over to
me so we can get a feel for whether this date works for people or if
we'd be better moving to a later date....

Also if anyone else is keen to do a talk let me know :)


Cheers

Hi Paul,

hmm interesting question.  There's quite a few certs in the
Information security world, most of which are pretty specialised, so
to an extent it depends on what area of security you're interested in.

For general Infosec positions the CISSP goes down well with HR types,
but it's only open to people with a certain number of years of
industry experience.  They do have a cert the SSCP
(http://www.isc2.org/sscp/default.aspx ) which is more geared to
people getting into the InfoSec industry, but it's not as well known.

On the more technical side, in my experience there's less clarity on
what the best certs are.  For pen. testing the CREST certs are well
regarded in the industry, but then again they're more targeted at
people who've been working in that area for a while.  the CEH is
reasonably well known but isn't always well regarded...

At the end of the day I'd say that the act of having taken the
initiative and studied / taken the exam  for most certs. would be seen
as a plus by most employers, although it doesn't always help get past
HR if they're looking for specific "keywords".

HTH

Cheers

Rory

One of my penetration testers took the offensive security exams and  
gave them the thumbs up. He said the content was thorough and relevant  
so I would go for them as a training tool. Unfortunately, Rory is  
right. Some are better known but lesser regarded as it's down to the  
marketing machines they have.

I would start with the O.S. courses and see about CISSP or SSCP. CEH  
is worth doing only because of the HR process knowing shag all about  
pen testing and looking for that buzzword. CREST will be out of your  
league in terms of cost (?1600 to sit the exam I think) and experience  
(Rory, I hear you are prepping for the app exam, is that right? Me  
too, in which case we should get our heads together and help each  
other study?)


Back to the subject, if you can wangle a few months internship at a  
consultancy then that will really help kick start your career. Have a  
look around.

I recently did the CEH cert and my impressions of the course was as follows:
* Good overview of  technologies
* Fair use of tools, however, some of the tools provided are outdated 
and is supposed to give you start.
* Excellent practical tests, this does not go into the darkest depths, 
but it is good enough to give you enough experience to get an overall 
feeling of what the topics are about.
* Quite expensive

Rory: why is the CEH not well regarded as opposed to the others? I can 
see that the Offensive Security courses are a lot harder.

Hi.

Hmm well I guess it probably got a bit of a rep. due to being a
multiple-choice based test.

There's a risk with that kind of test that the person taking it has
just memorized all the facts needed to pass the exam without actually
understanding the material or how to apply it.  It got really common
back in the day for Microsoft/Novell exams where there were a lot of
paper MCSE/CNEs around who had exam crammed all the certifications but
had limited real experience.

To be honest some of the other certs (eg, CISSP) get the same kind of
reputation, it's kind of a risk for any examination where it has a
multi-choice format, I reckon that's one of the reasons for the CISSP
that they introduced the experience requirement...

Cheers

Rory

Great point, there's no substitute for actual experience and something
like an internships a good place to start.

Thanks. The questions were multiple choice, 125 questions in 3 hours. I 
agree with the fact that you need to know what the right answer is. In 
some of the questions, my experience let me down since the answer they 
wanted was a wrong one..

Yep the CISSP was like that as well, not necessarily the right answer,
but the answer they wanted to hear!

Agree with the previous points, and from a big firm perspective, the 
highly regarded ones also include pretty much anything from SANS.  Sadly 
the large corporates seem to dislike the Offensive Security ones, and I'm 
betting this is entirely down to the name/marketing, but they do have a 
good rep with pen testers

CEH is a good foot in the door, and quite quick and easy to get through 
but focuses heavily on tools, so self study on methodology would be key.

CISSP or SSCP are a reasonable way into wider infosec, but not really 
applicable to pen testing. In addition, for big firms, they don't test 
experience (can be bootcamped) so are more an entry level or junior cert 
and not considered very deep.

The Cisco security certs are also quite relevant for infrastructure 
security.

Cheers

Rory

Re: [Owasp-scotland] Low Cost Training






One of my penetration testers took the offensive security exams and 
gave them the thumbs up. He said the content was thorough and relevant 
so I would go for them as a training tool. Unfortunately, Rory is 
right. Some are better known but lesser regarded as it's down to the 
marketing machines they have.

I would start with the O.S. courses and see about CISSP or SSCP. CEH 
is worth doing only because of the HR process knowing shag all about 
pen testing and looking for that buzzword. CREST will be out of your 
league in terms of cost (?1600 to sit the exam I think) and experience 
(Rory, I hear you are prepping for the app exam, is that right? Me 
too, in which case we should get our heads together and help each 
other study?)


Back to the subject, if you can wangle a few months internship at a 
consultancy then that will really help kick start your career. Have a 
look around.

team would provide applicable skills, whilst passing the CEH would guide a
resume through the first layer of HR.

At the moment, due to employment issues, the window of opportunity for
personal studies has closed, but after reading your comments, I feel
confident that following material published by the Offensive Security guys
will provide a solid ground to build on.

Thanks for the guidance.

Hi all,

Looks like we've got good numbers for 4th March (well assuming the
snow goes away by then and people can get into Edinburgh!)

Speakers are going to be ?ireann and my good self.   Kick off at
6:30pm, Ernst & Young 10 George Street Edinburgh EH2 2DZ.

What I was planning to do was give everyone an update on what OWASP as
an organisation is up to at the minute.  There's quite a lot going on
and some of it people from the Scottish chapter might want to be
involved in.  Also I'd be interested to solicit any ideas for what
people reckon would be good for OWASP Scotland to get involved in...

I'll update the OWASP scotland chapter page wiki with some more
details shortly, but any questions in the mean time , just shout.


See you all next week.


Cheers

Rory

Hi all,

I've put some details and a registration page up here
http://owasp-scotland.eventbrite.com/ .  If you reckon you'll be
coming along it'd be great if you could register on that page (it's
pretty painless, honest) as it lets us plan for the right numbers, and
it's useful for EY to have a list of attendee names for health and
safety :)

  I've invited a few university students along, I'd like to increase our
involvement from them/with them. Over all I think our Scottish chapter is
progressing nicely, but choosing some OWASP projects to support, and
defining some specific projects/events of our own would be good.

I'll leave plenty of time at the end for discussing those points.

Does anyone know anyone over at BP-Falkirk?

I ask because I am coming from Electric, and I'd love it if one of them was
present to discuss Oil & Gas.

(There are some subtle distinctions on Industrial Sec when you jump from one
silo to another)

Dear UK Lists

The Cabinet Office published its "smarter, cheaper, greener" ICT
Strategy at the end of January:

  http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2010/100127-ict.aspx

to reduce costs and "create one secure, resilient and flexible
network" and "deliver best IT to the public".  The 19 strategic
principles include:

* Ensure security from design through implementation to operation
* Adopt greater standardisation and simplification
* Adopt the principles of using open standards

It's quite high-level, but I was wondering if anyone wanted to get
together and provide feedback regarding this, on behalf of OWASP?  We
should be encouraging the adoption of secure development and
procurement practices.  Is this one place to do it?

The key documents/sections are:

Hi All,

Just a couple of quick notes on next weeks meeting.

Thanks to ?ireann , we've got a bonus speaker coming up from Cambridge
University, Shailendra Fuloria,  to speak on the same topic, with a
slant around security economics.  Also Rob Jansson reminded me that
OWASP meetings count for CPEs for CISSPs (and I'd guess for ISACA and
other related bodies), so it's worth holding onto the evenbrite
"ticket" as proof of attendance.

I'm sorry all, that was very un-professional of me. Shailendra's talk will
definately be worth the CPE credits.

Actually you get extra for writing it from what I can see on the ISC2
