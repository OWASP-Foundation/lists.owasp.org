Hi all ,

as a more concrete proposal, how does 6pm at Abbey Business Centre (83
Princes St (above Superdrug)) on the 26th November work for people?
We've got a presenter in that Lee's offered to
do a presentation on physical security / lock picking, which should be 
cool...

RSVP's ASAP PLS :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all ,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry for the late notice (been out and about on my travels a bit!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but wondering if anyone would be up for a meet, say last week of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> month/first week of next? Also does anyone have access to a venue we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could use for the meeting, as unfortunately EY are full-up this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> month...?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
