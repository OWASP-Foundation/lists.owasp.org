<PRE>Hi all,

Ok looks like there's enough folks around to do this :)

So meeting is 6pm(probably start the talk around 6:30pm) at Abbey
Business Centre (83 Princes St (above Superdrug)) on the Thursday the
26th November.


so main talk will be Lee (overview of it below) but sure there'll be
some time to have a general chat about some of the OWASP stuff as
well.  If people haven't seen it, there's a new Release candidate of
the top-10 2010 version just out which has some kinda interesting
changes in it..

&gt;<i> ==========================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lee Lawson is a principal consultant with dns and heads up the 'security
</I>&gt;<i> testing &amp; response' team.  During this OWASP meeting he will be talking
</I>&gt;<i> about physical security, specifically the weaknesses of locks as physical
</I>&gt;<i> security measures.  The presentation will take the attendee through some
</I>&gt;<i> basic attack techniques that will open most padlocks, pick most door locks,
</I>&gt;<i> open handcuffs and remove laptop locks such as the Kensington lock.  Lee
</I>&gt;<i> will cover shimming, raking, picking, tubular lock picks, electric lock
</I>&gt;<i> picks and bump keys.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This presentation is not intended to make you an expert in lock picking as
</I>&gt;<i> that takes time and practice, but it is a thorough introduction to the
</I>&gt;<i> subject and will educate the audience as to the inherent weaknesses of such
</I>&gt;<i> security measures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any lock picking tools or locks that you would like to practice
</I>&gt;<i> on then please bring them along.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ==========================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Cheers

Rory
</PRE>
