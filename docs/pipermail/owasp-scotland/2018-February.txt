All,

Pleased to let you know we have speakers confirmed for the OWASP Chapter
Meeting on the 14th March:


*Website Discovery & Managing the Shadow Estate*Speaker: James Penny
There?s been a lot of writing and talks about the problem of Shadow IT ?
where users are working on their own cloud services, devices, and using
unapproved software to get around ?restrictive? or unresponsive controls.

A variation on this theme that?s talked about less is the ?Shadow Estate? ?
services and websites that are launched without proper oversight and assent
from departments that should be vital stakeholders. The core issue remains
the same: the more controls we try to implement, the more project teams who
don?t share our priorities will attempt to avoid them.

This talk explores a few possible reasons for this phenomenon, and the
steps we in security can and have been taking to mitigate it.


*Analyst, Engineer or Consultant?*Speaker:Harry McLaren
A looks at common roles with cybersecurity from the perspective of a
Managing Consultant who?s been through several in quick succession and an
introspective analysis of what makes a successful cybersecurity
professional.
Tickets available on Eventbrite:
