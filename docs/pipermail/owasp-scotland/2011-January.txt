Hi all,

Happy new year, hope everyone survived the snow&ice of the last little while.

In terms of the next meeting date, I was thinking Thursday Feb 24th,
if that works for people?

Cheers

Happy New Year - 

Feb 24th works for me.  Would be good to catch up with everybody, get some security chat, and maybe have a part of the agenda for latest Owasp news? Both globally and Scotland?

Apologies, new to the group.

No issues with the date, can you provide a time and venue?

If the venue is an issue I can perhaps help with that.
