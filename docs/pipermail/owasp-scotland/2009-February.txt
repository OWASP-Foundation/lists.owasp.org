Dear UK Chapters

The OWASP Global Industry will be submitting a response on behalf of
OWASP to the interim Digital Britain report:

In particular we would like to provide input to section 5.3 Online
Safeguards.  There are additional notes and links at:

If anyone would like to submit ideas or suggestions relating
specifically to application security, please email me directly -
colin.watson(at)owasp.org - and I will produce a draft (deadline 5
March).  I will be talking about what else the Industry Committee is
doing at the next London chapter meeting on Thursday 12th March:
