<PRE>All,


Good news! Edinburgh University is kindly providing us with meeting space
for the next OWASP Scotland chapter meeting. We have an excellent talk
lined up by Boglarka on MFA and a second speaker should be confirmed in the
near future. If you are attending please register so we can keep an eye on
the numbers.


*Date:* Thursday 18th May
*Time: *6.30pm kickoff
*Location: *Ground floor main lecture room, Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton
Street, Edinburgh, EH8 9AB



*Twice the pride, double the fall &#8211; why 2FA / MFA isn&#8217;t the cure we all
thought it was. *Speaker: Boglarka Ronto


The security industry has been preaching the mantra of MFA for almost a
decade. Indeed, many implementations have surfaced, some better than
others, with all of these intending to add to the level of security of an
existing solution (i.e. external logon interface).

The trust in such services appears to be unquestioned: companies are
looking for cheap, simple and easily manageable solutions and rarely
consider the actual level of security associated with the product of their
choice.

This talk discusses ways of testing MFA solutions and includes a few case
studies of broken and poor MFA implementations, including one which allowed
SMS validation to be bypassed completely at an application level (no
physical proximity or cloned phones required).


*Speaker no. 2 TBC*
