<PRE>Evening all,

So following on from AppsecEU and the chapters workshop there, I've
picked up some ideas which I think can really help us get a more
active chapter.  Interested to hear what people think and any other
suggestions


1) Organize a chapter committee.  One of the big problems recently is,
I think, that I'm a single point of failure in getting things
organised.  I'd like to get 2-3 more people involved in running the
chapter, so that when I'm not available things still get sorted out.
It's not onerous at all (honest!).  So if anyone would like to
volunteer, just drop a line to the list or straight to me :)

2)  Sort out a more permanent location.  2nd main problem is
scheduling meeting without an &quot;always available&quot;, and ideally free
location.  the Royal Scots club was a great venue but not free..  I
was thinking, based on some chats with other chapters leaders, that we
might be able to speak to one of the Edinburgh based universities
about hosting.  Does anyone have connections there that we could speak
to?  A decent part of this would be location.  I reckon that it's
easiest for people to get to roughly city centre (especially for
anyone travelling in by train) so if we can sort something around
that, it'd be cool.

3)  Fixed dates for a year in advance.  This obviously helps people
plan, so they can attend.  This'll be dependent on sorting out 2) as
it's hard to fix dates, when we don't know if we can get a venue...


I think these three would be a good starting point...

Thoughts?


Cheers

Rory
