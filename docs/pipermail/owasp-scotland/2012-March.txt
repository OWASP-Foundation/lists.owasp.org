Dear OWASPs,

 

Anyone fancy joining me for security and privacy chat over drinks at the
Pear Tree tomorrow?

 

I'll be there from 8pm.

 

Cheers, Andy

Cryptographic Software in C"

 

Hi all,

 

I'd a great time at OWASP last Wednesday.  Thanks for all the comments.  And
thanks again to Rory and David for inviting me along.

 

In case you are interested in reviewing the slides, I've put them up here:

http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/adg/Talks/csec-edinburgh-owasp
.pdf 

 

For more info about our project see here:

http://research.microsoft.com/csec 

 

The CryptoForma event I mentioned, is advertised on a tab on this site:

http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/security 

 

Most of the talks will be very research-focused and specialised, but the two
tutorials should be of more general interest.  You are most welcome to
attend.  The detailed schedule should be up in a few days.

 

Hopefully I can make the next OWASP meet up; looking forward to seeing
everyone again.

 

Cheers, Andy

Hi Andy,

As a new member of the Scotland OWASP mailing group (and living in  
Edinburgh) I would have liked to join you in the Pear Tree.  
Unfortunately, I already have plans for tonight but let me know of any  
future developments.

Kind regards,

Robin
