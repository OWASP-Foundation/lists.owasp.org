</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of updates from me.  The meeting we'd been hoping to have 
</I>&gt;<i> with Brian Chess/Gary McGraw, unfortunately looks like it's not 
</I>&gt;<i> happening.  Their plans have changed and they're not going to be over 
</I>&gt;<i> in Scotland at that time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I was thinking that it'd be good to have a &quot;regular&quot; meeting in 
</I>&gt;<i> September.  In terms of dates, would Tuesday the 15th work for 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone? Also would anyone like to volunteer to do a quick (or indeed
</I>&gt;<i> long) talk ?  There's a couple of potential speakers already but the 
</I>&gt;<i> more the merrier :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rory
