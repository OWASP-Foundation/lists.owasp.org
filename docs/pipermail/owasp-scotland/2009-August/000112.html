[Owasp-scotland] Meeting in September?






Hi all,

A couple of updates from me.  The meeting we'd been hoping to have
with Brian Chess/Gary McGraw, unfortunately looks like it's not
happening.  Their plans have changed and they're not going to be over
in Scotland at that time.

So I was thinking that it'd be good to have a &quot;regular&quot; meeting in
September.  In terms of dates, would Tuesday the 15th work for
everyone? Also would anyone like to volunteer to do a quick (or indeed
long) talk ?  There's a couple of potential speakers already but the
more the merrier :)


Cheers

Rory
