<PRE>Hi Rory.

I don't think I will make it along to Wednesday's session unfortunately 
(due to domestic duties in the early evenings at the moment!). I'm 
interested in the subject of the talk and also in discussing some of the 
points you make on your blog so it would be good to meet up some other 
time.
