All,


I am pleased to let you know we have two excellent talks to kick things off
again after a long break for OWASP Scotland. This first meeting will be of
the virtual &#8216;lunch and learn&#8217; kind as we have been unable to secure a
meeting space for this occasion. Please drop me or Sean an email if you are
aware of an Edinburgh central / convenient meeting space for future events.
Meanwhile we will keep looking and keeping it virtual to move things
forward.


*Date:* Friday 3rd March
*Time: *12:00 &#8211; 13:00
*Location: *virtual (web conference details TBC)


*Penetration testing: a beginners paradise.*

Ever wondered how to go from getting a certificate in penetration testing,
or some tinkering in your spare time actually doing it as a full time job?
Come and get answers as Andrew Scott (Head of Security Testing for an
international bank) spills the beans.  How did he get into testing, what
other ways in are there?  How do you sell yourself to prospective employers
and make sure you are ready to do what they want to pay you for, not just
what you want to do.


*CSRF - Imitation is The Best Form of Flattery*

Despite appearing at number 8 in the OWASP Top 10 list (2013 version), CSRF
vulnerabilities are still prevalent in a multitude of applications. What is
CSRF? And why is this the case? What can be done to mitigate it? Sean
Wright (Lead Security Engineer at security MSP) will give you the details
to those very questions and more.


To attend, please register here for the event:
