<PRE>Greetings OWASP Scotland community,

The first OWASP Scotland Chapter meeting in 2019 will take place on
Thursday the 21st February. Many thanks to Fanduel, who has kindly offered
to host this event for us.  They will also be providing pizza and
refreshments on the evening.

We have two great talks lined up from Margus Lind (Context IS) and Don
Smith (Dell SecureWorks). We will be providing you with an update with
Don's talk details as soon as we get our hands on them!  Tickets are, as
usual, available on Eventbrite via link the link below. Seats are limited.

*Seeing what is not there: searching in Windows paths*
*Speaker: Margus Lind, Context IS*
Windows &#8211; designed to make training materials self-improve.
During a recent Windows breakout and privilege escalation training session
we stumbled upon several new instances of exploits. While the underlying
principles are well known, it is shocking to see such weaknesses
exploitable out of the box, even on the latest Windows 10 RS5. Firstly, the
presentation will give a brief overview of the way Windows searches for
required commands and DLLs. This will be followed by some practical
examples of how it can be exploited to escalate privileges and bypass UAC.
Overall, we&#8217;ll see that while Windows makes an ever improving attempt at
security features, the spaghetti bowl of legacy features and behaviours
remains rather entertaining...

*[Talk title and description TBC]*
*Speaker: Don Smith, Dell SecureWorks*

For attending this event you will be able to claim 2 CPE points.

Date: Thursday 21st February
Time: 18:00 &#8211; 20:00
Location: Fanduel, Quartermile One, Level 4, 15 Lauriston Place, Edinburgh,
EH39EP

Tickets available on Eventbrite:
