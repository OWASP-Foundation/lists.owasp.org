Message-ID: <AANLkTinDFUM51UDu1_9Ydaz29_HU6Ko8B5LJ6ADvRiPj@mail.gmail.com>

Who is talking? What will it be about? Who is coming?

Most importantly who is buying the beer afterward?

If we have no other suggestions, I'd love to hear about Forensics or
Incident Response...

Hi all,

Good point.

How's about early-mid June - Thursday 10th or 17th say?

Couple of requests.  Any offers of hosting available? I'll check with
the usual suspects, but if anyone else may be able to host, let me
know.

Also anything in particular people would like to hear about, or indeed
anyone like to do a talk on anything?  I was thinking that it's been a
while since we've done much web application security stuff so that'd
be good to hear.


Cheers

Rory

Some folk in Scotland might be interested in this "nearby" OWASP event
in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on Wednesday 16th June.  It looks like you can
get a train from Glasgow for less than ?25 return, and from Edinburgh
for less than ?20.

After all, Northumberland used to be part of Scotland...

Regards

Colin

SSL/TLS - Just when you thought it was safe to return

2009 was a serious year in breaking secure protocols. SSL/TLS was no
different. Hacking SSL/TLS has a big return as a blackhat hacker, once
you penetrate a corporate network, stealing login details and
passwords are just the beginning. SSL VPN's can also be vulnerable to
a number of attacks. There are a number of tools and techniques that
are readily available that can make defeating SSL/TLS both simple and
well within the reach of the unauthorized attackers.The talk focuses
on the research and tools of Moxie Marlinspike, who has gained an
excellent reputation as an independent security research. With some
interesting attack vectors, you'll be surprised at the results one can
achieve.

Arron Finnon - www.finux.co.uk
