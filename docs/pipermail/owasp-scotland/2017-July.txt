Subject: [Owasp-scotland] OWASP Scotland Chapter Meeting - August
Message-ID: <CAGw=jO3LPtrituTiBSDatm+A7V0=5CC-dVYL4-yFHZSPC9yZtA@mail.gmail.com>

Hope everyone is enjoying the summer and ready for the next OWASP Scotland
Chapter meeting as we have secured two great talks for you. Please see
blurbs below for details and Edinburgh University are again very kindly
providing us with meeting space.


We have had great feedback from the previous event and look forward to
seeing you all at the end of August. Very likely to be networking
opportunities after the talks over a refreshment at a nearby watering hole.


*Date:* Thursday 31st August
*Time: *6.30pm kickoff
*Location*: MF2 on the 4th floor, Informatics Forum, 10 Crichton Street,
Edinburgh, EH8 9AB


*Deconstructing WannaCry*

Speaker: James Slaughter


- Who, What, Where, Why and How.

-  Or, how I actioned the incident and learned more about the malware to
help our organization weather one of the largest malware events to occur in
recent history.



*Driving remediation in large organisations*

Speaker: Andrew Scott


Congratulations!  Your vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and bug
bounty programmes are all running really well.  But what about
remediation?  When it comes to fixing the problems identified by the
various assurance programmes it?s easy to become swamped by the sheer
volume and not make enough progress on actual fixes.  How do you sort the
must fixes from the nice to haves and how do you push the fix rate up and
the time to fix down?  I?ll look at a number of the challenges here and
some solutions.
