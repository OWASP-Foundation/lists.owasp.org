Hi all,

As it's been a while since I sent out the invite for this months
meeting, I thought I'd send a quick reminder out in case anyone who'd
like to come along hasn't reserved a place as yet.  Sign up is at
http://owaspscotland-november2012.eventbrite.co.uk/

Cheers

Rory

Hi all,

Just a quick mail to say thanks to everyone for coming along last night and
in particular to Martin from Edinburgh University for hosting and Jamie and
Rab for the talks.

As I mentioned during the meeting Securi-Tay is on in January (16th)
web-site is here http://www.securi-tay.co.uk/ for anyone who'd like to go.

BSides Londons site is here http://www.securitybsides.org.uk/ and the CfP
is open for this one if anyone would like to submit a talk

Next meeting should be in February, I'll get some details of it out in the
new year.

cheers

Rory
