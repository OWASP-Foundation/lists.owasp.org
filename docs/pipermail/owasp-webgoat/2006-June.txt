Message-ID: <25F9916710FF404DAD2B96B14F66AB4904DE6C@posta.bdoit.bdo-it.prag>

Hello, 

firstly, thanks for this interesting education application. Secondly, I
tried to find some "all in one" documentation (Google, package etc.) and
I've found only few fragments. So did my friends. So I'm sorry if my
comments are little bit off topic because RTFM problem :-). 

Anyway I have a bunch of "little troubles" either with WebGoat itself or
with individual tests. So I will try to make some list:



1) At the beginning I just overlooked
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat_Getting_Started (it's definitely
not the first bullet) and also
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat_User_and_Install_Guide_Table_of_C
ontents. I can't see because of my eyes :-). 

Finally I type http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/attack and I can see password
prompt. I don't know tomcat-users.xml yet, so I'm guessing few ones -
with admin/admin I can see "HTTP Status 403 - Access to the requested
resource has been denied". With webgoat/webgoat or guest/guest it is
o.k.  

An interesting "bug" is, when you do the following sequence of URL -
http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat (with any account) ... code 404,
http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/main.jsp (with 500 - internal error) and
http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/webgoat.jsp (you are in). (it's "discovered"
just by chance, because I firstly overlooked getting started.)  I think
that just http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat is more obvious and the
"getting_started" should be more visible. 


2) Documentation says "application running on default port 8080" - but
in fact it's just 80. I'm speaking about windows WebGoat 4.0 release run
and play release, not the UNIX one.

3) general tests - little troubles with "timing", but the java source
says 1500 thread sleep - in this moment it's clear :-)

4) unvalidated parameters - everything clear 

5) remote admin access - I have some clues, but still didn't finished
:-) (i'm a lame :-)

6) LAB - role based access control - little bit of playing with password
(obvious "name", but focus is on defeating RBAC, not trying to guess
what's the password - it could be written there), I can delete any
account. I'm moved to 2nd and 3rd stage, test is not finished and I
probably don't understand the task " Implement access control in the
Businesses Layer to verify authorization to use the Delete function
before actually executing it." I should change the source to improve
this function?

7) path based - everything clear

8) access control matrix - clear

9) forgotten password - clear

10) authentication cookie - clear (and nice :-)

11) how to hijack the session - mechanism is clear, webscarab sessionID
analysis works well, incrementation of one part and timestamp of the
second part of the weak cookie is obvious, but I have to improve the
final technique - I'm little bit lame :-)

12) basic authentication - very easy, but there is a little mistake in
the second field - even I'm using basic:basic or my custom id, required
answer is webgoat:webgoat, which doesn't correspond with actual id (e.g.
YnVyZ2hpOmJ1cmdoaQ== is burghi:burghi, but I can see "* Basic
Authentication header value is incorrect.". 

There is another error - the second stage wants me to reautenticate as
basic basic. But I'm logged as burghi:burghi or later I changed it to
basic:basic or webgoat:webgoat. But the application still
reports:"You're almost there! You've modified the Authorization header
but you are still logged in as burghi.". But I'm in this moment
webgoab:webgoat, as is clear from headers "Authorization: Basic
d2ViZ29hdDp3ZWJnb2F0 
Cookie: JSESSIONID=4B40F9585857E8CBFE52996C8521842E". 

I finished this task at the end, but I don't have a score in "burghi"
account, only for webgoat account. 

13) XSS jumped over (I will play with it later)

14) buffer overflow - I just clicked on it and I saw congratulations
...? Probably the magic is in " This lesson needs a creator." 

15) command injection - clear

16) parameter injection - same as buffer overflow



to be continued - sorry, it's little bit longer, so I will try to
continue later. I guess that some of my failures are just my lack of
skills, but some of them I hope are really errors. I will try to find
some time to help to fulfill some articles in wikipedia. 

best regards

Kamil Golombek

Hi Kamal

Thank you for your feedback! You are correct, the main README file is 
missing from the Windows_WebGoat-4.0_*.zip distributions.  I will add the 
README to the distribution lists as soon as possible.  This is a HUGE 
oversight on my part.

There are some simple instructions for adding WebGoat user accounts to 
Tomcat  in the Standalone distribution.   The developer version has a "HOW 
TO create the WebGoat workspace.txt" which includes some basic instructions 
for setting up the IDE and running WebGoat but all the releases are missing 
the basic README file.

We are actively working on the WebGoat user guide 
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat_User_Guide_Table_of_Contents)  and 
hope to have that completed soon.  WebGoat is a community effort and the 
user guide work is often the hardest to complete.  We certainly would 
appreciate your help in updating this guide.


The lessons that specify "This lesson needs a creator" are lessons that I 
would like to get built but haven't had the time.  It would also be nice to 
have a forced browsing lesson :)

Regarding the basic authentication lesson... After you have entered your new 
credentials, the OLD JSESSIONID is sent with your NEW request which contains 
your NEW credentials.  This OLD JESSIONID is still a valid session id and 
therefore your new credentials are ignored.  You have to delete the OLD 
JSESSIONID when the request is sent with your new credentials...

I will work on improving the LAB instructions.


Bruce

Thanks James

The automated build process has changed significantly since the last release 
and the quality control department has not done an adequate job! :)

I will address these issues in the next release.

On the UNIX version of WebGoat 4, none of the shell scripts can be run
directly.  All scripts produce the error "/bin/sh^M bad interpreter".
The scripts can be fixed with dos2unix.

I also did not find a README file from the UNIX distribution
(Unix_WebGoat-4.0_Release.zip).

Hello Guys

I'm coordinator for OWASP-Spanish project/mailing
list, in a personal level, I've taken the challenge of
internationalizing WebGoat. It was easier tha I though
so, soon, I'll be sending you a beta release for you
to help me test and eventually integrate in current
development.

Hope this helps to easily translate the Software to
many languages and fast-track it's spread across the
word.

Cheers
Juan Carlos
