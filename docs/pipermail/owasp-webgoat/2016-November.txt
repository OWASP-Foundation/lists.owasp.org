Hello,

I was so pleased and comfortabl using WebGoat 5.4 that I've been
delaying several times the switch to version 6 and 7.

I started using WebGoat 7 (webgoat-container-7.0-SNAPSHOT-war-exec.jar)
some weeks ago and I'm really puzzled :  a lot of things simply don't
work any longer properly :(

For example, when running "Command Injection" lesson, when clicking on
the "view" button, requests are not sent using POST but GET method. Is
it normal ? Has anyone face thoses problems ?

Hi Laurent

All the lessons in WebGoat 7 were tested so they should all work.  Is the lesson no longer exploitable, is the lesson generating an error, or is the exploit path different?  

There is an issue (can't remember the number) that has all the test results for each lesson. If the lesson no longer worked it should have been excluded from the release bits. 

If you could provide more information on which lessons failed and the reason for failure we can get it corrected. 

Thanks for your help and support.
