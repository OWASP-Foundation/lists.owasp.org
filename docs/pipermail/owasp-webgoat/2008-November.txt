Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Customizing WebGoat Menu
Message-ID: <214902.47176.qm@web59511.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I have just installed and tried several WebGoat lessons. It's a great resource to learn web application security.

I am planning to do a demo on WebGoat, but only for several lessons. I would like to know how to customize the WebGoat menu in the left site, so it won't display all the lessons. Can it be done ?

Thank you very much

Hi Angela

It is controlled inside of WebContent\WEB-INF\webgoat.properties.  There
are several example files at
http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/source/browse/#svn/trunk/webgoat/main/p
roject/WebContent/WEB-INF

Hi Bruce,

Thank you very much for the reply.

I've checked the file you mentioned :

> It is controlled inside of
> WebContent\WEB-INF\webgoat.properties.  There
> are several example files at
Here is the content of the file you mentioned :
#lesson.BufferOverflow.hidden=true

What does it mean ? Does it mean that the BufferOverflow lesson is hidden if the comment mark is removed?

May I know where can I find the lesson list ? In the webgoat-class.properties or webgoat-lab.properties ?

Thank you very much

Hello,

I've been playing with WebGoat 5.2 for a while now and I have some
questions. I was unable to complete the insecure login exercise (stage
2) because tomcat don't accept https connections. How can I do to
enable the https port (443 or another one) on tomcat? I have modified
the server.xml file and I have read tomcat documentation but it
doesn't work.

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards.

Hi Daniel

What is the error you are receiving?

If you are running from eclipse you need to manually move the .keystore file to where the error message says it couldn't find it.

Do you see the HTTP connector for port 443 in the tomcat console window?

Hello WebGoat team.

I've noticed that the new patch from Microsoft patches XMLHTTPRequest
set-cookie exposure to HTTPOnly cookies.
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-069.mspx

And although this patch really does block at least set-cookie exposure
(This is the result of pressing the XMLHTTPRequest Read button)



WebGoat is still showing a failure, screen shots below.

This was confirmed on XP/IE 7.0.5730.13

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Logout not working
Message-ID: <492579B2.1090004@zhaw.ch>

Dear list

I just wanted to do a small CSRF demonstration that logs you out of
WebGoat (URL: http://10.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack?action=Logout).
However, it seems that calling that URL (or clicking the link on the top
right of the screen) has no effect at all - in particular, the user
remains logged in.

Is this a (known) bug or did I miss anything?

Thanks,
Marc

No, I think you are correct. To the best of my knowledge, this 
functionality is not implemented.

Actually, from the source, it looks like you need to do:

http://10.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack?Logout=true

 From Session.java:

// FIXME: requires ?Logout=true
// FIXME: doesn't work right -- no reauthentication
if (myParser.getRawParameter(LOGOUT, null) != null)
     {
     System.out.println("Logout " + request.getUserPrincipal());
     eatCookies();
     request.getSession().invalidate();
     currentScreen = WELCOME;
     previousScreen = ERROR;
}

The second FIXME refers to the fact that since WebGoat uses Basic 
Authentication, and there is no way to tell a browser to forget its 
Basic Auth credentials, you will simply be directed to the Welcome page, 
rather than being forced to enter the "guest:guest" credentials.

Hope this helps.

Hi Marc

I haven't tried this, but if you could programmatically clear the basic
auth header and the session id during the logout, you could force
webgoat to re-auth you (ie, you would be logged out).  This is the
premise behind the basic auth lesson and it does work.  I don't know if
you can clear it from the logout code and have it be honored by the
browser.

Because of the basic auth Authorization header (as Rogan said), WebGoat
just creates a new session id based on the basic auth credentials.

Bruce
