The *WebGoat* project is working hard to *release 6.0 *prior to AppSec
USA.  Currently, we are on target but could use your help.  The 6.0 release
is a major modernization effort of the infrastructure. You can now run the
latest version by *downloading the nightly build* that has an *embedded
tomcat server*.


*Continuous Build*:
https://webgoat.atlassian.net/builds/browse/WEB-DAIL/latestSuccessful/artifact/JOB1/WebGoat-Embedded-Tomcat/WebGoat-6.0-SNAPSHOT-war-exec.jar

*Page with all the documentation* (including how to run):
http://webgoat.github.io

*Request Jira Access *or send detailed bug details *by sending email to
Bruce*
webgoat at owasp.org

The next release will be a port of the lessons based on the feedback from
the WebGoat Survey:

*Take the Survey:*
https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OWASP-WebGoat-Modernization

*Join us *at AppSec USA in the* Project Summit room* on *Friday from 9-12
AM*

All

Thank you for the quick responses in notifying me of the permission issue.
The anonymous access to the latest build has been fixed.  WebGoat and the
build process are all new, so bear with me as we work out the kinks.

Thanks to Dave Cowden for fixing this!

Hello Bruce

The link is broken for me I got a 404 Page not found for https://webgoat.atlassian.net/builds/browse/WEB-DAIL/latestSuccessful/artifact/JOB1/WebGoat-Embedded-Tomcat/WebGoat-6.0-SNAPSHOT-war-exec.jar

Yet I was able to clone the git repo and run it on Eclipse, so far it looks good :)

Yet I see that on the internationalization area there is a lot of work to be done yet, just a few lessons support it, and that implementation is partial even on those lessons.
 
Once that is working, count on the Spanish project for the translation of it. :)

Juan C Calder?n
