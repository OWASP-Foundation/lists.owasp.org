You have to either:
1. Install WebGoat and run it. The solution for each lesson is
available from within the lesson.
2. Download a standalone version of the solutions from my project in
"Appendix A: WebGoat lesson plans and solutions":

Message-ID: <2CD91D44-3D74-4C49-A0C3-A1366428EE45@westchasetech.com>

Hello Group,
I'm a new user to webgoat and stuck at lesson 1, so it's not looking  
too promising. I understand proxies and web application attacks, but  
the problem is that neither web scarab or burp seem to intercept  
connections to the local host. If I make a connection to anything  
other than my macine (cnn, ebay, my routers web interface, etc) the  
proxy jumps in place and I can examine / modify headers and parameters  
but it just doesn't seem to catch things locally.
Again, in a nutshell, proxy intercepts when connecting to remote  
hosts, but doesn't see anything when I connect locally, I've used IP  
(127.0.0.1) and hostname (localhost). The only solution that comes to  
mind is setting up a VM, install webgoat on it, modify the config to  
allow remote connection. While that may work I'd prefer to solve the  
problem at hand.

What's the trick to intercepting the calls to webgoat with web scarab?

I'm using OS X 10.5.7 and the latest stable builds of WebScarab, burp  
and webgoat. I've tried with both Firefox and Safari and I get the  
same results.

TIA,
Ryan

There used to be an IE (7?) issue where you had to add a "." to the url
after localhost in order to get the browser to use the proxy setting for
localhost.  However, I doubt you're using IE :) and I've not seen this
behavior with the other browsers.  Check to ensure the "no proxy for"
field is empty in FireFox connection settings and that any "bypass proxy
for localhost" settings are not configured for any browser.

Other than that, I don't have any other suggestions.  Sorry

Bruce

Hello Ryan,

I am testing the issue at the moment. For me, I have an error with a class
file. I remember that issue. I think I have to replace some files
of the 5.2 release by older files from the 5.1 release. Sorry WebGoat people
for not having alerted you earlier. I was not member of that
mailing-list then.
The other issue may also be the port you are running your WebGoat on. Do not
forger to specify the port 8080 in the URL bar
if you run webgoat with /bin/sh webgoat.sh start8080.

I will later give you updates on how I manage to run WebGoat on Unix systems
(Linux or Mac).

Regards,

G.B

Make sure you're not setup to bypass the proxy for local addresses.  
That gave me trouble on my Mac at first, too.

For Safari, that's at the bottom of the control panel where it says  
"Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains" - I think it  
defaults to having "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" there - remove them.

For Firefox, it's also at the bottom of the dialog: "No proxy for:"  
and it has "localhost, 127.0.0.1" in there by default. Blank those out.

Good luck!

Ryan,

this will probably will do:

Check to ensure the "no proxy for" field is empty in FireFox connection 
settings and that any "bypass proxy
for localhost" settings are not configured for any browser.

Australi) and I need it for research purposes.
I would be grateful if you provide me with the solution.

You have to either:
1. Install WebGoat and run it. The solution for each lesson is
available from within the lesson.
2. Download a standalone version of the solutions from my project in
"Appendix A: WebGoat lesson plans and solutions":

Hello Group,
I'm a new user to webgoat and stuck at lesson 1, so it's not looking 
too promising. I understand proxies and web application attacks, but 
the problem is that neither web scarab or burp seem to intercept 
connections to the local host. If I make a connection to anything 
other than my macine (cnn, ebay, my routers web interface, etc) the 
proxy jumps in place and I can examine / modify headers and parameters 
but it just doesn't seem to catch things locally.
Again, in a nutshell, proxy intercepts when connecting to remote 
hosts, but doesn't see anything when I connect locally, I've used IP 
(127.0.0.1) and hostname (localhost). The only solution that comes to 
mind is setting up a VM, install webgoat on it, modify the config to 
allow remote connection. While that may work I'd prefer to solve the 
problem at hand.

What's the trick to intercepting the calls to webgoat with web scarab?

I'm using OS X 10.5.7 and the latest stable builds of WebScarab, burp 
and webgoat. I've tried with both Firefox and Safari and I get the 
same results.

TIA,
Ryan

There used to be an IE (7?) issue where you had to add a "." to the url
after localhost in order to get the browser to use the proxy setting for
localhost.  However, I doubt you're using IE :) and I've not seen this
behavior with the other browsers.  Check to ensure the "no proxy for"
field is empty in FireFox connection settings and that any "bypass proxy
for localhost" settings are not configured for any browser.

Other than that, I don't have any other suggestions.  Sorry

Bruce

Hello Ryan,

I am testing the issue at the moment. For me, I have an error with a class
file. I remember that issue. I think I have to replace some files
of the 5.2 release by older files from the 5.1 release. Sorry WebGoat 
people
for not having alerted you earlier. I was not member of that
mailing-list then.
The other issue may also be the port you are running your WebGoat on. Do 
not
forger to specify the port 8080 in the URL bar
if you run webgoat with /bin/sh webgoat.sh start8080.

I will later give you updates on how I manage to run WebGoat on Unix 
systems
(Linux or Mac).

Regards,

G.B

P.S: Bruce I apologize for the annoyance, I mistook the reply button with

Currently, WebGoat does not support this.  The only way would be to
"port" WebGoat to Chinese.  Having WebGoat support internationalization
and localization sounds like a great OWASP season of code project!  

Deadline is June 29th for project submissions
