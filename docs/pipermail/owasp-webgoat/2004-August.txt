First of all I would like to say Hi, I'm new in these
parts but eager to learn so please be gentle !!

It almost seems a silly question (but I was always
told its only silly not to ask so here goes .....)

I have just installed webgoat 3.0b with java and it
loads fine on my Windows XP box. I log in as guest and
find the initial page without problem.

However when it comes to log in (I assume to keep a
scorecard) the username I submit comes back backwards
and I cannot log a username into the database.

Is this part of the test ? or a problem.

Also does anyone have a link to the lessons on pdf ?

Thanks for the opportunity to learn.

Alan

That's the "HTTP Basics" lesson.  That all the lesson does. The lesson plan
explains the basics of http and the lesson gets you familiar with the
features of WebGoat. The user name you enter is just a string that gets
reversed....

Feel free to send me any more questions.

Bruce.
