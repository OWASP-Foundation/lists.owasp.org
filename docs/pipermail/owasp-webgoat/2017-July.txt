Hello!

I am new to installing WG and trying to determine how to change the listening IP.  I need to run this in a restricted VM network and the listener on localhost isn't going to work.  I have tried the standalone jar, which doesn't allow IP modification, and currently trying to sort out how to change IP using the spring-boot.  Is this possible?

I've answered my own question.  I added the following:


server.address=x.x.x.x


To WebGoat/webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application.properties


Which was somewhat counter intuitive since it's called during startup for Spring-Boot

mvn -pl webgoat-server spring-boot:run
