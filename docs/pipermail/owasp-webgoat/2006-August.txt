Hi,

I'm new to webgoat.

I'm using Windows_WebGoat-4.0_Release that contains Java and Tomcat.
I'm at this first part of chapter "Broken Access Control" that is
"Remote Admin Access". I looked at the hints as well as the "view
source" and Java source but I could not exploit it. Also I'm not able
to reach tomcat admin page as mentioned in the hint. Can someone help
in fiding what could be missing here.

Thanx.

Hi,

I've been working on Webgoat-V4 since a couple of days. I was working
with "Basic Authentication" lesson when I get this error after what I
feel was a right answer given by me:

"* Error generating org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.BasicAuthentication"

I had entered following in the form:

What is the name of the authentication header: Authorization
What is the decoded value of the authentication header: guest:guest

I tried the same in another machine but I get the same error.

Am I doing something wrong or I just hit into a bug?

Thnkx

Attention OWASP Community,

OWASP is moving all of our mailing lists off of SourceForge and onto our
own infrastructure. We?re making this move to allow for better control
over the mail infrastructure and to address some service problems we?ve
been experiencing. Your account will be moved automatically, and you
don?t need to take any action. However, you may want to set your spam
filter to allow messages from the new lists. All OWASP email lists will

Thank you for your continued support of OWASP.

Hey Guys,
 
I'm trying to finish up the live CD for OWASP.. Eoin will be releasing it at
OWASP Seattle...
 
I'm having some problems with WebGoat. I have JRE 1.5 installed so WebScarab
works great.
 
However, I get problems trying to run the webgoat.sh file on both the live
CD environment and on a HD install...??
 
Do I have to install JDK ?
 
Any links on this?
 
It just stops with errors...

Ok,

So this has been renamed Java SE 5.0 JDK right?

So I should install the new JDK 5.0 update 7 version? 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/j2se-namechange.html

Has anyone else had problems with the ^M at the end of each line? Should I
use the dos2unix command to correct this?

Cheers,

JP

Hey Guys,

I have replaced the ^M in all .sh files ( I think ) and installed JDK

Update:

Looks like everything starts OK.. It says "success" to starting Catalina..
But it's not listening on port 80 or 8080. I shut down Apache2 for testing
on port 80.

To get to this point I wrote a script to use sed for replacing the ^M. I
verified this with vi.
One thing I noted is that I don't get the errors now or the section below:
Using CATALINA_BASE:   ./tomcat
Using CATALINA_HOME:   ./tomcat
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: ./tomcat/temp
Using JAVA_HOME:       /usr/jdk1.5.0_08
:

The Using XXXX doesn't print now.


Could this be a problem with jdk 5.0? ( 1.5.0 update 8 ).
I have the issue that java won't work unless you call it using the full path
( Ex- usr/jdk1.5.0_08

I have set my JAVA_HOME in the Webgoat.sh and using the export command. It's
not set anywhere else.

Cheers!

JP
