I take this to mean that you are not incorporating my patch to the
StoredXSS lesson.  If that is not true, you can disregard the rest of
this :-)  From the above I think that I have not been clear with what
this patch does.  It does not allow users A and B to XSS each other. 
It only allows users A-1, A-2, A-attacker, A-victim, etc to XSS each
other.  My idea was that in a classroom, you would create (at least)
two user ids for each student.  The main one would be A-attacker (or
whatever you wanted to name it), but for training XSS and XST and
CSRF, that user would use the A-victim id to simulate another user to
attack.  I usually implement this by logging into the app twice at the
same time using two different browsers (IE and FF).
 
&gt;<i> Every user also requires credentials be entered in tomcat-users.xml in order

</I>
Yes, A-attacker and A-victim are completely separate tomcat users and
both require a password (so student B can't log in as A-something and
mess with student A).  The code in the lesson just treats them
specially when it accesses the database, basically pulling messages
posted by user like A%.

All that being said, if you don't think that this is useful, then you
don't have to include it.  I'll probably post a .patch file to the
mailing list here after 3.7 is released so others can use it if they
desire.

Have a good one.

Chuck
