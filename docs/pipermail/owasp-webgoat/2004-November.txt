WebGoat has lessons on both stored and reflected XSS. You can use the
reflected XSS lessons to do what you want to do simply by sending your
victim an email that has a link exploiting the vulnerable page in WebGoat.

The stored XSS lesson used to work the way you want, with all users messages
going into a single list.  But it was confusing for students who want to
test with *their* messages only.  If you'd like the multi-user behavior, you
can change StoredXss.java in the makeList method as follows...
ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery( STANDARD_QUERY + " WHERE user =
'" + s.getUserName() + "'" );

to

ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery( STANDARD_QUERY );

Message-ID: <053a01c4d656$61856480$6e01a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Hi Everyone,

WebGoat 3.5 was released today.  Download the latest version from http://www.owasp.org/software/webgoat.html

This new version includes many improvements to existing lessons, better lesson instructions, as well as some new lessons.  We also upgraded to use Tomcat 5.5.4 and JDK 1.5.

We are actively working on some new lessons ( DOS, parameter injection, and Buffer Overflow ) and I will create a new release as soon as those are completed.  If you have any ideas for new lessons... now would be the appropriate time to send me an email.

Bruce.

I suspect that you have the checkbox for "bypass proxy server for local 
addresses" checked.
