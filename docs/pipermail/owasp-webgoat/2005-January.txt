Hi,
I have a problem with running the WebGoat. I downloaded the one with
the JDK and then I tried to run the webgoat.bat but it keeps
displaying many lines and then eventually it stops and the last line
displayed says:
INFO: Server startup in 3355 ms (*or some other number*)
does anyone have any idea how I can run it?

Thanks,

Amir

Amir,

I forgot to include a README in the delivery

After running webgoat.bat:


Browse to http://localhost/WebGoat/attack   (It is case sensitive)


login using:

Username: guest
Password: guest

Bruce.

Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Webgoat Authentication Problem
Message-ID: <F6ACE76E2968BF49B36E5501CC594A970F745295@gsnbp10es.ny.fw.gs.com>

Greetings,

I've installed WebGoat on a W2K3 system using the
WebGoat_StandAlone_with_JDK1.5.zip and it worked fine.  

Now I need to move it to a Solaris server (v2.8).  The server already had:

Tomcat 5.0.27
J2SE 1.4.2

So I shutdown Tomcat, downloaded WebGoat.war from the sourceforge web site
and dropped it into the "webapps" directory.

Started Tomcat.  Opened a browser and went to
http://servername.com:port/WebGoat/attack
<http://servername.com:port/WebGoat/attack>  and it asked me to
authenticate.  I tried guest/guest and webgoat/webgoat for my
username/password pairs but that did not work.  

Now I believe I have the proper tomcat_users.xml file in the "conf"
directory.  Here it is:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="webgoat_admin"/>
  <role rolename="tomcat"/>
  <role rolename="webgoat_user"/>
  <role rolename="role1"/>
  <role rolename="standard"/>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <user username="webgoat" password="webgoat" roles="webgoat_admin"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat"/>
  <user username="role1" password="tomcat" roles="role1"/>
  <user username="both" password="tomcat" fullName=""/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin,manager"/>
  <user username="guest" password="guest" roles="webgoat_user"/>
</tomcat-users>

What could be the problem?  Both guest and webgoat as usernames and
passwords should work, but it doesn't.

Thanks for any help.

Thien

Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Problems with WebGoat
Message-ID: <997ef2c2050116221211bc1ec6@mail.gmail.com>

First off, thanks for the tool, it has been both educational and
entertaining.  I am, however, having some problems using WebGoat.

I've previously seen mention made of problems logging in.  I have had
no problem with this when going to http://localhost/WebGoat/attack,
however, the User guide recommends using a tool called form scalpel
(which was nearly impossible to find, please feel free to email me for
the updated link where I got it) for manipulating form elements.  I've
been working at the JavaScript Validation lesson for quite awhile now,
and while I understand what to do, I cannot do it.

Initially I tried using Achilles to perform MITM Proxy attacks on
it... it was all good, but either the page would never finish loading
(whenever I tried to edit the page before it got to my browser), or
the program would crash (whenever I tried to submit the form with
proper data then change it before sending it out to the server). 
Failing at this I moved on to trying to use form scalpel. 
Unfortuntately, I have no idea how to load the page in form scalpel to
even begin working.  I get a 401 error no matter what page I try to
load (from WebGoat) and I believe it to be because of the necessity to
authenticate using the guest/guest credentials.  If there is a way to
tell form scalpel to do this, I am unaware of it.

If anyone has any other tools, or suggestions on how to complete this,
please let me know.  I may also be having some problems with a couple
of the others which I will address later if necessary.

If someone could email me directly, that would be perfect, otherwise I
will keep checking back.

Thanks,

Nathan McFeters

    If you are having problems with Achilles, try Odysseus 
(http://www.wastelands.gen.nz/odysseus/index.php).  I have only used it 
a little, but it is a similar, Windows based proxy.  I did have trouble 
with it not drawing screens properly if you are running at a larger than 
normal font size, so if you run into that, go back to the standard DPI 
in your display properties.

    Another option is Sleuth (http://www.sandsprite.com/Sleuth/).  I 
wouldn't recommend either of the Java based proxies (Paros or WebScarab) 
right now.  I just haven't been able to get them to work reliably, but 
maybe that is just me.

    Good luck.

Chuck
