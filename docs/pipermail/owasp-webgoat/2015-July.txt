Hi, this is my first post to this list.  I am impressed by WebGoat; thank you to all who work on it.
 
If I see a problem in WebGoat  6.0.1, Build: 247 should I report it here?  I am not sure I have time to contribute changes right now but hope to in the future.
 
In the CSRF tests, I can't click on the Message List link.  I think its because the link is located within the <form> element.  When I move the link out of the <form> element I can click on it and invoke the embedded script.
 
I see some other wording glitches, and may have a comment on Command Injection next.  Thanks again!

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Command Injection
Message-ID: <SNT151-W7414825339E6105D8C170791940@phx.gbl>

At Bruce's suggestion, here is another.
 
I couldn't get the Command Injection solution to work on Windows in WebGoat 6.0.1, Build: 247.  The & separator between Windows command line commands is also the parameter separator in the POST data, and messed up the parameter parsing?

I was able to do the attack by using the || separator, which on Windows means that if the first command fails, execute the second command.  So I misspelled the file name to type and followed it with my added command, and only one command:

HelpFile=AccessControlMatrixXX.help" || netstat -an&SUBMIT=View

Which returned the result of netstat to my screen but did not give me credit :(

Perhaps the test in the exec() methods could be changed from:

 if ((command[2].indexOf("&") != -1 || command[2].indexOf(";") != -1) && !er.getError())
 
 
to:

 if ((command[2].indexOf("netstat") != -1) && !er.getError())

Hi, I am just about ready to be a Contributor to WebGoat.  I am running on Windows 7 and have GitHub set up, the source cloned to my desktop, the project loaded into Eclipse, and a bat file that runs maven to build and starts WebGoat.  This is all probably not a big deal for everyone else, but this is all new to me!

I have run through all of the examples in WebGoat except for the final Challenge.  About a quarter of the way through I saw problems and posted them to this list, and Bruce asked me to contribute.  Kept notes on the rest of the examples, some of which I could not get to work and of those some might be my misunderstanding.

Questions:

Who is currently developing on WebGoat?

Since the mailing list is quiet, are there side discussions going on?

What are the current priorities for fixes and improvements?

Is there a schedule in mind for when there might be the next release?

Is anyone else using Windows to run and develop WebGoat on?

Should I just start fixing things, anywhere and all over?  Is anyone working on certain areas I should hold off touching or coordinate with?  This is the first time I have used Git and worked with a group like this, all separately located.

Would someone please reply to this post just so I know someone has seen it?  Maybe say hello?

Hi Mitchell

The project is fairly active and we communicate using email and have a
bi-weekly call and screen share to touch bases with each other.  There is a
core team of about 5-6 people and an extended team of a few more that pop
in and out when life allows them time to contribute.

This mailing list is fairly quiet as most people send email to
webgoat at owasp.org and that forwards to my work email.  I reply from that
email which is not on the WebGoat mail list so the mail list is very
inactive.

We get a few requests to contribute per month but a small percentage of
those folks actually contribute.  We encourage contributions at any level.

To answer your questions:

Who is currently developing on WebGoat?
  - The about page in WebGoat is fairly accurate.  Nanne and Jason are
probably the most active contributors right now
  -
https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/pages/about.jsp

Since the mailing list is quiet, are there side discussions going on?
  - Yes, I will bring up the topic of using the mailing list again.  A lot
of use our work emails to communicate and don;t wish our work emails to be
in the archive.

What are the current priorities for fixes and improvements?
  - We are finishing the new plugin architecture in the WebGoat and
WebGoat-Lessons Repos
  - We are changing the UI to backbone
  - We are looking for new lessons
  - We have had lots of volunteers to test but no active output from those
efforts
  - We are working on getting better documentation and cleaning up of the
various websites

Is there a schedule in mind for when there might be the next release?
  - As soon as we get the UI working again

Is anyone else using Windows to run and develop WebGoat on?
  - Windows and Mac are the two big dev platforms

Should I just start fixing things, anywhere and all over?  Is anyone
working on certain areas I should hold off touching or coordinate with?
This is the first time I have used Git and worked with a group like this,
all separately located.
  - If you are working in the WebGoat or WebGoat-Lessons repos you may want
to coordinate.  We use jira but right now it is more of a free-for-all as
we get the 6.1 release stable
  - Once you create Pull Request it will get reviewed by the team.  It is
safe to work on any lessons in the WebGoat-Lessons repo.
  - It is better to file a Jira ticket, but not needed

Would someone please reply to this post just so I know someone has seen
it?  Maybe say hello?
  - HELLO :)

Hey Mitchell,

I'm Jason ... the primary UI contributor currently .. and the road block to
our next release. :)  My momentum is picking back up. I'm working at
re-implementing the 'helps' for each lesson currently, sorting out an
async. issue currently for solution/plans/source. Next up is to re-enable
the hints, then the Cookies/parameters.  I've had some folks say they're
ready to help, but no pull requests yet (we have our FT jobs and our issue
tracking is lacking a bit ... I accept a bit of the blame there).

BTW, I work on Linux for development, so I welcome some Windows/Mac users
for testing purposes. E.g. someone caught a legacy file (same name, diff.
case in file name) that was creating an issue on Windows.

As to schedule, I definitely want to have my part wrapped up in time to
have 6.1 out around AppSecUSA (mid-late September) although I don't think
I'll be there this year. For me that means the next 2-3 weeks to allow
burn-in and fix time after the initial Backbone implementation.

As noted, there have been a number of side conversations. I'll make it a
point to be more active here on the list while respecting the work email
issue.

Cheers,
Jason

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] WebGoat 6.1 (Unstable Repos) Status
Message-ID: <CAJREbOUkoUJVJ8h3GTz-5nxidaTLgoGdxW8=_BteuHx1Tbsi0Q@mail.gmail.com>

The 6.1 (Unstable - WebGoat and WebGoat-Lessons) release is working again.
The UI is a bit rough in areas especially around navigation and lesson
rendering.  There is still some functionality that has not been hooked back
up like cookies, lesson completion, ....  We also have some browser
specific issues like chrome renders better than safari, if you experience
some rendering problems try a different browser until we get it all sorted.

The majority of the plugin architecture is completed and works well.  Each
lesson is now self contained and easier to see all the parts and pieces
like lesson specific code, internationalization strings, lesson plans, and
lesson solutions.

If you are building the 6.1 release, please pay attention to the README, as
it will not build properly without building the webgoat-classloader first.

T*he WebGoat-Legacy release is still the preferred release for users.  *
