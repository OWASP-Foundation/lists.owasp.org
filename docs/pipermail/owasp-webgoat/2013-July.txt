Hello everyone,

My Name is Anirudh Anand and I am a Second year under Graduate student in
Computer science. I started working with webgoat recently and I liked it
very much. I really loved the way WebGoat works. It is really helping me to
understand concepts related to Web-Application and security. Now I really
like to be a part of the wonderful webgoat developer team and I wanted to
know how can I contribute towards this project. I will be very grateful if
someone can help me initially with it.

Thank you !

Hi Anirudh (and to all the other requests I've received)

WebGoat 6 is the newest branch and resides at:
https://code.google.com/p/webgoat/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fwebgoat-6.0

This is the latest port of WebGoat to the SpringMVC framework.  The only
lesson that has been ported is HttpBasics, but the foundation for the port
has been laid.

There are several major things that are needed.

1) Redesign of the presentation layer.  Currently WebGoat uses a
combination of JSPs with apache ECS (Element Construction Set) for the
presentation layer.  The whole presentation layer needs to be moved to a
new technology that preferably is well known and has some demonstrable
weaknesses.

2) Port of all lessons to SpringMVC - this is a fairly trivial task.  If
the lesson seems outdated or no longer works we need to mark them for
deletion or rewrite.

3) Redesign of the session management and lesson architecture.  Not sure
how much work is needed here, when I went to port the SQL Injection
lessons, I realized some major refactoring was needed and I stopped.  We
can still port the lessons and do the refactoring later.

4) All the other items that are needed for a complete rewrite....


If you synch to the WebGoat 6.0 branch, you can import the project to
eclipse as a maven project and everything just works.  Let me know if you
need any help with this.

I really need someone to step up and start porting lessons.  Don't worry
about mistakes, we can get them fixed and learn as we go!

Bruce

Hello Everyone

I would like to thank all the people who have responded to help with
WebGoat 6.  WebGoat 6 will be a complete rewrite of WebGoat using newer
technologies that can take advantage of some more complex exploits.
 Instead of responding individually, I thought I would respond to the group.

WebGoat 6 needs a kick-start!  Even if you only can help for 1 hour, it is
still help....

I would really Like to help and be a part of this team but since this is
the first time, I am facing a little difficulty. I haven't tried eclipse
before. So I have no idea how to import the project and work in it.  So if
someone can help with with some very small task like importing a lesson, I
can learn how to do that and then I will become confident and will work for
this project more. I always have starting troubles. Sorry for that. Hope I
can start contribution soon.

There are multiple ways to build and run WebGoat.  I will cover some basics
here.  Enough to get people started.

1) Checkout the source code for google code:

svn checkout http://webgoat.googlecode.com/svn/branches/webgoat-6.0

Note: you will need https and a gmail account to check code in.  You will
also need to be a contributor to the WebGoat project.  Send me your gmail
address if you want to be a contributor.  See:
https://code.google.com/p/webgoat/source/checkout for checkin account info

2) Start eclipse (you will need to make sure m2e is installed.  m2e comes
with eclipse post 3.6 versions)

In Eclipse, from the File menu: File -> Import...

>From the import dialog's filter text box type in: maven
Choose: Existing Maven Projects
Browse to the webgoat-6.0 checkout folder
/pom.xml WebGoat:WebGoat:6.0:war   should be selected, select this pom file
if it is not
Click Finish

3) You can build from eclipse or from the command line.

>From the command line, cd to the webgoat-6.0 folder, there will be a
pom.xml file in this folder.
To Build: mvn compile

4) To run from the command line:
mvn tomcat:run-war

5) Browse to:  http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack


All of this can be done with eclipse as well, but I would need to add
pictures on how to set it up.  I will do that in the wiki in a few days.
 Or someone else can volunteer to create a wiki page on how to do that.

As always, let me know if there are questions.

Bruce

if you have not used eclipse just download it and play around. Also there is lots of stuff online to get you started. :)

Thank you so much for helping. I would really like to become a contributor
of WebGoat 6. My email address is anirudhanand722 at gmail.com.

I installed eclipse and its going good. But I can't import pom.xml to maven
projects. Don't know why ( may be because it is a read only version ? ) I
got the read only version of the source code. When I browse in to the
WebGoat directory, I can see pom.xml but Eclipse is not allowing to choose
it. why is it so ?

If you guys are busy, I will create the wiki page once I understood the
procedure so that others can read and understand it easily. Wiki pages are
really useful to starters.

Hi Anirudh

What is the error you are getting from the eclipse import of the pom file?

If you have a .classpath, .project, or settings file/folder in your WebGoat
directory, you will need to delete those before the maven import.

Another thing to try to make sure the tree is synched correctly is to
issue: "mvn compile"  from a shell window in the webgoat-6.0 root.

"mvn clean" will remove the files if they are in the directory.

I included Cassie in this email just to introduce her to the project
WebGoat 6.0.

I was having troubles with eclipse last day and I am still working on it.
At first it failed to start because java_home variable was not set
properly. Once after I do that, it launched successfully and after a system
reboot, it again shows some error like : JVM failed to start. Returned exit
code 13". I don't know why is that but I will figure it out soon. I am
having this trouble because I haven't worked with Java before.

I was looking forward adding a new lesson to WebGoat under the category
"Code Quality". Now there is only one challenge below that category. So I
would like to add just one more to it. A bit more challenging problem.
Haven't decided the code through.

I can choose the POM file to open it in eclipse...

Once after I do that, it launched successfully and after a system reboot, it again shows some error like : JVM failed to start. Returned exit code 13". I don't know why is that but I will figure it out soon. I am having this trouble because I haven't worked with Java before.
