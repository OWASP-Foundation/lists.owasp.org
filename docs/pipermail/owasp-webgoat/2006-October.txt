Hi all,

I am trying to get the remote admin login work. As mentioned in the "Hints"
about the url parameter which needs to be altered to get admin access, I
tried all the ways but with no luck.

Can anyone help me with this.

thanks in advance.

cheers..

Hi All,

I am new to the list. While browing the archives I came across Dr.
Holger Peine post.

Dr. Holger, were you by any chance using Firefox during the run? I was
using Firefox and ran into exaclty the same problem as you did.

Using IE in this particular case might be useful I guess.

Cheers~

Pradeep,

I guess someone had already answered your question in the past.
Anyways, as per the hints one out of 2 ways is to append a parameter.
That parameter is admin=true which makes the admin interface hackable.

See if this helps any further -> http://seclists.org/webappsec/2006/q3/0271.html

Indeed, I was using Firefox. As I had announced in my follow-post to
this list, the cause was the JavaScript code using "form[0]" instead
of "document.form[0]" as it should be. Apparently, IE was more tolerant
regarding this bug than Firefox. I already submitted a patch to the
Webgoat maintainer.

Regards,
Holger Peine

WebGoat 5.0 is coming!
 
Thanks to the OWASP Autumn of Code project award and the many contributions from individuals and companies the 5.0 release will have many new lessons and improvements.  Now is the time to provide your feedback on existing WebGoat functionality and new lesson ideas.  If you've made corrections/improvements to the existing installation and would like to have those changes integrated into the baseline, send the changes to me and I will merge your changes in.
 
The 5.0 release will occur early 2007 so time is running out...

Since you asked :-)

Especially after seeing the AJAX presentations at the conference in
Seattle, I'd love to see some AJAX lessons added to WebGoat.  I would
envision them being additional variations of the same attacks that are
already there (parameter manipulation, sql injection, cross site
scripting, etc).  Ideally, it would be nice to have at least one AJAX
lesson using XML transport, one using JSON, and one using serialized
Java (i.e. the Google Web Toolkit stuff).

I realize that this is a lot of work because each lesson will involve
creating both some sort of plausible AJAX UI along with a backend
service, but I think it would be a tremendous benefit to OWASP.  AJAX
is so popular and we need a good vehicle for testing AJAX tools and
for educating ourselves and others about the technology.

A couple other ideas for lessons:
- More advanced XSS, where simple <script> stuff is filtered.  Maybe
make it so the XSS is in a form's set value do the attacker must close
the form tag.
- More advanced SQL injection, maybe where data from another table is accessed
- Cross Site Request Forgery
- HTTP Header injection

Another thing that I would like to see is the return of the source
distribution of WebGoat (i.e. just the WebGoat files, not Java,
eclipse, etc that are included in the current "developer" zip file).
Was this eliminated because the code is available in CVS?

I think that is enough for now.  Have a good day all.

Chuck

Message-ID: <5B3E26A588E828439EC7D2D58F6870BD08989407@sv057088.exchange.commerzbank.com>

Hi,

I tried to solve the command injection lesson. I failed.
I'm using XP and the Webgoat 4.0 edition. I replaced the
original value 'BasicAuthentication.help' in the POST
parameter HelpFile by:

'BasicAuthentication.help">"a.txt"&&copy "a.txt" "b.txt'

I checked the solution at the command line. That worked
fine. I varied directories and command separation characters.
I used '&' and ';' as separators. 

Does anyone has any idea?

Thanks a lot for your help
Joerg
