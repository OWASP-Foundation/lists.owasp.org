Hi there, 

 

I was able to generate successful HTTP splitting attack after using the
answer given to me. 

 

What I see is that after the form is redirected, the response (where
request is redirected to) contains the query string that contains
malicious code, the next browser request then gets the URL with
malicious code in it. This works fine, although I am still vague what
was happening. 

 

However, if I simply paste this URL (the one with malicious code) into
browser and GET it, the attack does not happen. 

 

Any idea why that is so?

Thanks, 

Yan

Hi,

I have problem with this lesson too. I had read up the OWASP testing
guide (which includes a section on HTTP splitting as well), the hints
and this mailing list but somehow it didn't work out for me. I'm
wondering if it might have anything to do with the system itself. I'm
using OSX 10.5 with safari (firefox didn't work too). Tried with
webgoat 5.0 and 5.1 RC1 too.

By the way when i'm using 5.1 RC1, clicking the "Show Java" opens
another window but no javasource was displayed. No such problem with
using v5.0.

Hi,
A follow up of my previous post.

It appears that the webgoat project does not really work well with OS X 10.5.
For the same lesson (HTTP splitting) using the same answer, the exploit
works with Windows XP with IE but not on OS X 10.5 with Safari/Firefox. Hope
that the project contributors can have a look into this.

Regards,
Henry

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] syntax error in readme.txt
Message-ID: <E1Ipm63-0005wO-65@fenris.runbox.com>

OWASP WebGoat maintainers,

There may be a fairly significant error in the WebGoat readme.txt.  Under INSTALLATION / Windows, the Note reads:

When intercepting request with IE7.  You must add a '.' to the end of localhost.  i.e. 
          http://localhost./WebGoat/attack           or
          http://localhost.8080/WebGoat/attack    if using a non standard port

I suggest that in all instances, that syntax should require a colon ':' rather than a period '.'.  Using a period fails to work in both IE6 and Firefox.  Users will be frustrated since WebGoat is unreachable using these instructions.  Please correct the instructions as indicated.

Thanks, Brian

Thanks Brian, I will fix that ASAP.

The extra "." is for IE 7.  Previous versions of IE 7 would not proxy
requests for localhost unless you put a "." at the end of the name. I'll
leave the "why this is so" as an exercise for the reader...  

Either way it should be more clear and I have fixed that for 5.1 RC2
