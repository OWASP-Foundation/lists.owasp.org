Check the console window to see if any other errors occured.  If there are
no other errors, what happens when you browse to
http://localhost/webgoat/attack or http://localhost:8080/webgoat/attack

 Hi,

I have installed webscrab on my machine also i have webgoat. I have gone
through the webscrab userguide and followed the same instructions but not
sure why webscrab is not intercepting request wen i browse the webgoat
tutorials. I have used the 127.0.0.1, 8008 proxy in IE as well as webscrab.

When I open the browser the request that is intercepted is only the homepage
and when i put in the localhost/webgoat/attack and try to access the links
there is no request been trapped by webscrab.

Can anybody tell me what could be the reason. Any settings in IE that needs
to be configured.

Thanks,
Yogesh

Hi,

I have installed webscrab on my machine also i have webgoat running. I have
gone through the websrab userguide and followed the same instructions but

I have checked the proxy and it is the same in IE and webscrab 127.0.0.1
port 8008.

Is there anybody who can help me out of this.

Thanks,

Hi Yogesh!

I don't have the goat set up but here's what I'd try/check:

Is interception enabled in WebScarab? You might have to click somewhere for it to start intercepting and not just pass the requests through.

Are you getting some kind of "The proxy is not responding" error? Then the browser is set to use a proxy alright. Double check port settings.

Are you getting normal traffic, no browser error, but no interception? Check for settings like "No proxy for localhost and 127.0.0.1" if the goat runs locally. Check that interception is enabled (as said above). Check that proxy settings are in effect by turning off WebScarab and ensuring that you now get "Proxy is not responding" in the browser.

   Regards, John

 Thanks!! for you reply Jhon

I have checked the proxy and unchecked the not required options. Here is my
problem,

1) In IE When I browse http://localhost/webgoat/attack the request is not
intercepted by webscrab. But when I type google or any other url it
intercepts the request.

2) In Mozilla Firefox when I type http://localhost/webgoat/attack the url
changes to http://www.localhost.com/webgoat/attack.

what could be the problem.

Thanks
Yogesh

I tried using  http://127.0.0.1./webgoat/attack in IE and Mozill but no
success. In mozilla it is giving connection terminated message.

I can browse http://localhost/webgoat/attack in IE but webscrab is not
intercepting the request. But when i type any other url it is accepting the
request. Do i need to disable the firewall.

Please help!!!!

Thanks,
Yogesh

I'm just guessing there's something fishy with localhost vs remote sites. Check so the browser doesn't have some exception like "don't use proxy for localhost". I know Firefox has/had a blacklist under proxy settings that excludes/excluded localhost and 127.0.0.1. Also check if WebScarab has some exception rule for localhost or 127.0.0.1.

 Hi Yogesh, all,

 I believe that you might find the "Bypass proxy server for local 
 addresses" ticked in the connection tab of IE.

 In Internet Explorer look at Tools, Internet Options, Connections, Lan 
 Settings and ensure that there is no tick on the bypass proxy tick box.
 that should fix IE. As for Firefox however, Sorry but im no expert :(

 Regards
 Terry.

Hi all,

   I'll take this opportunity to promote my project, which may
simplify things a bit.  The OWASP Broken Web Apps project provides a
VM with a variety of vulnerable web applications, including WebGoat.
If you use that VM, you won't have to worry about configuring web or
application servers, special settings for localhost proxies, etc.
Plus, you get a variety of other web applications to play with.

   More information is available at www.owaspbwa.org.

Hi All,

Thanks!! for you reply

I tried all the options suggested by you all i also tried reinstalling
mozilla and now i get connection was reset error.

I guess i will have to check if there is any problem with my laptop...but
don't think so...If I want to use mozilla for webgoat tutorial what are the
setting that i need to check apart from the proxy 127.0.0.1 port 8008....

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Yogesh
