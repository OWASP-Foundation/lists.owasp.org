All (sorry for the leaders list spam but I wanted wide distribution)

I would like input and feedback on the future direction of WebGoat.  WebGoat
has been fairly stable for the last few years and I would like to get input
from the list on the future direction.

I would like to see WebGoat incorporate some of the educational and training
materials provided at OWASP.  WebGoat has been a useful tool for teaching
"how to hack" and therefore the assumption is that one can know how to
prevent the attack if they know what the attack is (bad assumption).
WebGoat has some labs on adding protection against SQL injection, XSS, and
basic input validation but I would like to see each lesson have a secure
coding recommendation as well as an implementation of that mechanism.  *WebGoat
could then be used as more of a training tool to show the attack, educate
the user, AND show a potential mitigation strategy.  *

OWASP has some good tools, guides, and training that could be leveraged by
WebGoat and I would like to see WebGoat go in that direction.  Yes, there
are some outstanding issues and some general cleanup of "less useful"
lessons that need to occur but the general education direction seems like
the right step.  (Yiannis - yes, your buffer overflow lesson is in my
baseline)

The main goals I see are:

1) Add educational content
2) Expand the enterprise feature, that most people don't know about, to
track user training progress.
3) Create a distribution that organizations can use, not just individuals.

I hope to present a further expansion of these ideas at the OWASP Summit or
at least have enough information and ideas to come up with a game plan for
the next release of WebGoat.  Please send your comments or ideas to the
WebGoat list or directly to me at webgoat at owasp.org.  *Do not reply to the
leaders list*. I will summarize the ideas I receive and send out another
email.

There have been over 600,000 downloads of WebGoat (according to Google and
SourceForge) with only 5,000 in the last year.  WebGoat has become
stagnant.  Let's fix it!

Awesome direction.  You have my vote.  Perhaps tying in other references to
O2, ASVS, AntiSamy, or other OWASP related projects would help bring some
perspective and reminders to the users of yet other beneficial deliverables
or tools that OWASP provides.

There is a rumor that Bruce migth be going to the Summit, so I really
think we should have one (or more) Workong Session(s) focused on WebGoat

Hi Bruce,

It would be nice to be able to drop a jar representing a lesson to a
folder and have WebGoat pick it up and repopulate the instance once
reloaded, so that it shows as an actual lesson within the
corresponding page.

That way adding lessons will become a lot easier!

Thank you,

Yiannis

Hi,
I downloaded the file WebGoat-OWASP_Standard-5.3_RC1.7z and ran the file
webgoat.bat but the application does not run when I tried to access "
http://localhost/webGoat/attack"
Please let me know why I am unable to run the application.

If I remember well it either has to do with the port (try 8080) or the fact
that it is not spelled correctly (WebGoat but I thought it has changed
to webgoat).

webgoat.bat is for port 80 while webgoat_8080.bat for 8080

Make sure you don't run any servers on port 80.

See webgoat demos:

If you are looking for a turnkey solution, check out the OWASP Broken

already configured.  Info at http://www.owaspbwa.org/.  We just put
out a new release and we welcome any feedback.
