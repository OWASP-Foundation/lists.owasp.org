I have webgoat5 running on a raspberrypi and I would like to add to that
and help anyway I can. My plan is to group lots of GoatPI's together and
display the status on a teaching computer with the ability to control the
over ssh.

So a dashboard of everyones webgoat? No setup, just a working server
that is cheap enough to give to each students, or reuse?

That is so hot. I want one! I want many!

So awesome.

Rohit

Look at the WebGoat 6 branch.  The HTTP basic lesson was ported to Spring
MVC.  Not saying it is right or wrong, but when I went to port the SQL
Injection lesson I got stuck on how to manage the session data.  any help
is welcome.  Would you like me to make you a contributor?  Also, I would
like to use Trello, but have stopped updating it.  I'm trying to reboot
WebGoat 6.

I'm trying to reboot the WebGoat 6 effort.  Most of the lessons will change
with this effort.  I would very much like to continue to link to the YGN
Ethical Hacker Group movies.

Thank you for all your efforts!

All

If you are experiencing unsolveable lessons, we need to fix it. The final
hint in the WebGoat hints should be the solution.  The challenge is the
only lesson that does not provide additional solution information as that
is part of the challenge to obtain that information.

If you could specify specific lessons, browser type and version, and host
operating system that would certainly help.
