Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Version 2 A Big Thanks to AspectSecurity.com
Message-ID: <1037586335.2694.300.camel@voodoo>

You may all noticed I subscribed y'all to the OWASP-WebGoat mailing
list. You should have all got details of how to set your subscription to
digest etc by now.

If the code is not yet in the CVS it will be very very soon.

I wanted to start by saying thanks and "hats off" to Jeff Williams and
Bruce Mayhew of Aspect Security. I spent most of Saturday night playing
with WebGoat V2 and I gotta say its amazing. What a fanatastic tool ! My
wife was most impressed and I am telling you that really is something.
She sat there for an hour doing the lessons. 

I just dropped a war into my webapps dir and away I went. The wole
concept and way you've written it is just so damn cool. Its
extensibility and design make it the perfect platform in my opinion from
which to continue your great work. I for one am really looking forward
to working with you guys. You clearly know your stuff !

I know Bill's not back from vacation yet, but I also think given the
significant leap forward from Version 1 we should release this as a Beta
1 release now and plan for a final 2.0 release before the end of the
year. I am always impatient but getting this out, especially ahead of
this Weds press release will ensure it gets the exposure it deserves.
You guys have clearly put in a lot of effort, have been great to chat to
and this lines up with the OWASP GPL and Free Software Foundation
philosophy perfectly so I want to return the efforts by getting your
company any exposure we possibly can.

If no one has any objections I will make some screen captures and do
some basic page layout for the WebGoat tab tomorow, and link it to the
WebGoat 2.0 Beta 1 package at Sourceforge for download.

When Bill returns from galavanting in the South Pacific well start the
process of figuring out next steps.

Once again thanks to Aspect Security and its so great to have you guys
aboard.

Mark

Isn't it just!

Just wait 'till the release version;-) The lessons are being tuned etc.
With the text from this testing project we can add deailled textual
lessons in how to test for each issue, and then allow people to actually
do it. What a coool concept.

If you have ideas for lessons plans you can mail Bil Hau the project
Manager (bill at owasp.org) or the WebGoat list so it gets to the
developers and tech lead for this version (Jeff Williams, the man that
created it).

Any help greatly appreciated - look on this as a trial user..

Thats a great idea Tim. I will wait for Jeff and Bruce to answer for now
but also we can add that to the feature requests on the Sourceforge task
manager.

WebGoat v1 (WebMaven) - the user guide has a spoiler at the very end.
Did you want more details, like step by step how to exploit?

The source code (specifically wm.cgi) will show exactly what types of
input will trigger the exploits.

Hope that helps.

Thanks for that David but it's v2 that I'm after info on. v1 just crashes
all the time, v2 seems much more stable.

Isn't it just great ! Don't know whats wrong,  but if you use the bug
tracking feature at Sourceforge we would all be greateful and can
schedule a fix.

Thanks

Tim,

Here's a very short cheat sheet.  I'm not sure now whether we should make this part of the distribution or not.  Thoughts?
  1.. Http Basics -- use this one to demonstrate that HTTP is stateless, request-reply protocol. Click show parameters to show what's going with each request.
  2.. Fail Open Authentication -- try removing the password parameter entirely using Achilles.  Or you can do it on the URL with (http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Username=jeff) -- when there's no password, an exception gets thrown and the authentication step gets skipped.
  3.. HTML Clues -- view HTML and search for a comment with admin:adminpw -- use this to authenticate
  4.. Parameter Injection -- show how shell calls can be used to run arbitrary code -- use the & character to chain commands on windows -- blah.txt & netstat -a & ipconfig
  5.. Unchecked Email -- enter a message that contains linked offensive content -- Hi, check this out....<A href="http://www.google.com">Click here for Google"</A> and it looks like it came from the website.
  6.. SQL Injection -- 101' or 1=1 to get the whole contents of the db
  7.. Thread Safety -- this one's tricky -- use 'new window' to get two browsers.  Enter 'dave' in one window and 'jeff' in the other.  Then set it up so you click on the submit boxes as fast as possible.  If you do it fast enough, the application gets confused and returns the second clicked account to both browsers.  This is a massively underreported problem in many many web apps.
  8.. Weak Authentication Cookie -- use achilles to add 'AuthCookie=ggfkggfk;' to the Cookie: header using Achilles. Note that the cookie is username:password (jeff:jeff) backwords and one-letter up.
  9.. Database XSS -- enter <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">alert("Ha Ha Ha");</script> in the message and then click on the name of the message below to show that anyone who reads the message is attacked
  10.. Hidden Field Tampering -- there are a number of ways to edit a hidden field.  I like IEBooster, but you can use Achilles, or even try to modify it in the URL (e.g. http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Price=9.99).  Change the price of the TV from 4999.99 to 9.99.  
  11.. Weak Access Control -- this page is supposed to let you access files in a certain directory.  But if you use ../topsecret.txt you can get other files.  Would be nice to enhance this with some url, hex, unicode encoding attacks.
  12.. Challenge 1 -- the challenge is tricky.  To get past the first page, you have to remember how to turn on showing of the java code. Check the lesson plan link to find out that the lesson plan is called ChallengeScreen.html.  Then force browse to /WebGoat/src/lessons/ChallengeScreen.java.  Find the username and password (youaretheweakestlink:goodbye).  Note: there is another option -- if you sniff the network, you'll see a UDP packet with the username and password in the clear.  Cool huh?
  13.. Challenge 2 -- you'll need to modify the 's' hidden field to contain 101' or 1=1 (like the database lesson). Use Achilles or IEBooster.  This will give you all the passwords.
  14.. Challenge 3 -- you'll need to know a bit about Server Side Includes here -- syntax is <!--#exec tag1="dir" -->  So you'll want to do something like <!--#exec tag1="echo defaced > [PATH]\index.html" -->.  This will overwrite the index.html with your content and win the challenge.

I'd stick with making the last hint in the list the "I give up" hint.  Many of the ones below are already there.

This is great. Maybe one of the new devs (Maureen or Andrew if I recall)  could add the cheats to an additional button on each page or similar ?

It seems that WebGoat only works with Tomcat 4.1.12 (maybe newer
versions as well).
 
I had problems with 4.0.6 but all went smoothly when I moved to 4.1.12
 
I encountered some oddities though
 
Here is a resume:
 
1) the 'Unchecked mail' page seems designed to run on a linux/unix
platform (you spawn sendmail). I haven't looked at the code but it calls
up cmd that is a windows shell. So that didn't work for me in windows.
 
And in windows you don't have the sendmail program :)
 
In linux:
 
ExecResults for 'cmd.exe /c sendmail mads at opencs.com.br'
 
Returncode: 0
Exception: java.io.IOException: cmd.exe: not found
 
In windows:
 
ExecResults for 'cmd.exe /c sendmail mads at opencs.com.br'
 
Returncode: 1
Bad return code (expected 0)
 
 
2) The parameter injection page that throws a dir listing does not work
in linux because it try to spawn the 'cmd' shell once again.
 
Maybe (most likely) I have misunderstood something
 
Do you have an idea of what I am doing wrong?
 
What would be the recommended machine architecture for running this?

Not a bad idea - I'll add it to netgoat. I'm currently working on Tomcat
security guide, so if someone could add it to WG 2.0 that'd be
fantastic.

Hi Jeff
Thanks for that, really appreciate it.
I think a cheat sheet with the distribution would help. Typically, I would
see this being used by a development team. The lead developer may set this
as a task for his team but I think an actual definition of the methodology
on how to break it would be pertinent. This way, the lead developer can be
assured that the team are tackling all the issues and bits aren't missed. Of
course, there are many ways to skin the cat and I think one of the benefits
of webGoat is that it gives an opportunity for developers to be inventive -
in this way, the cheat sheet would act as more of a baseline than the
"correct" way of exploiting the vulnerabilities.
 
Thanks again Jeff
 
Tim

Subject: Re: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Cheat Sheet


Tim,
 
Here's a very short cheat sheet.  I'm not sure now whether we should make
this part of the distribution or not.  Thoughts?

1.	Http Basics -- use this one to demonstrate that HTTP is stateless,
request-reply protocol. Click show parameters to show what's going with each
request. 

2.	Fail Open Authentication -- try removing the password parameter
entirely using Achilles.  Or you can do it on the URL with (
http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Username=jeff
<http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Username=jeff> ) -- when there's no
password, an exception gets thrown and the authentication step gets skipped.


3.	HTML Clues -- view HTML and search for a comment with admin:adminpw
-- use this to authenticate 

4.	Parameter Injection -- show how shell calls can be used to run
arbitrary code -- use the & character to chain commands on windows --
blah.txt & netstat -a & ipconfig 

5.	Unchecked Email -- enter a message that contains linked offensive
content -- Hi, check this out....<A href=" Click'>http://www.google.com"
<http://www.google.com> >Click here for Google"</A> and it looks like it
came from the website. 

6.	SQL Injection -- 101' or 1=1 to get the whole contents of the db 

7.	Thread Safety -- this one's tricky -- use 'new window' to get two
browsers.  Enter 'dave' in one window and 'jeff' in the other.  Then set it
up so you click on the submit boxes as fast as possible.  If you do it fast
enough, the application gets confused and returns the second clicked account
to both browsers.  This is a massively underreported problem in many many
web apps. 

8.	Weak Authentication Cookie -- use achilles to add
'AuthCookie=ggfkggfk;' to the Cookie: header using Achilles. Note that the
cookie is username:password (jeff:jeff) backwords and one-letter up. 

9.	Database XSS -- enter <script language="javascript"
type="text/javascript">alert("Ha Ha Ha");</script> in the message and then
click on the name of the message below to show that anyone who reads the
message is attacked 

10.	Hidden Field Tampering -- there are a number of ways to edit a
hidden field.  I like IEBooster, but you can use Achilles, or even try to
modify it in the URL (e.g. http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Price=9.99
<http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Price=9.99> ).  Change the price of
the TV from 4999.99 to 9.99.  

11.	Weak Access Control -- this page is supposed to let you access files
in a certain directory.  But if you use ../topsecret.txt you can get other
files.  Would be nice to enhance this with some url, hex, unicode encoding
attacks. 

12.	Challenge 1 -- the challenge is tricky.  To get past the first page,
you have to remember how to turn on showing of the java code. Check the
lesson plan link to find out that the lesson plan is called
ChallengeScreen.html.  Then force browse to
/WebGoat/src/lessons/ChallengeScreen.java.  Find the username and password
(youaretheweakestlink:goodbye).  Note: there is another option -- if you
sniff the network, you'll see a UDP packet with the username and password in
the clear.  Cool huh? 

13.	Challenge 2 -- you'll need to modify the 's' hidden field to contain
101' or 1=1 (like the database lesson). Use Achilles or IEBooster.  This
will give you all the passwords. 

14.	Challenge 3 -- you'll need to know a bit about Server Side Includes
here -- syntax is <!--#exec tag1="dir" -->  So you'll want to do something
like <!--#exec tag1="echo defaced > [PATH]\index.html" -->.  This will
overwrite the index.html with your content and win the challenge.

I have a .net re-implementation of the 1.0 goat I call netgoat (see the
included image) that makes it much easier to deploy the goat on Windows
servers.

I've done this mainly to prove that although ASP.NET goes out of its way
to assist you doing things the right way by hiding session management,
supporting forms based auth directly, &c, you can still subvert security
by not paying attention.

The installation process for netgoat goes like this:

* Install the .Net framework (if you haven't already)
* Make a new virtual directory (like webgoat) in iisadmin
* Copy the netgoat content to the vdir location
* Establish the DSN and you're done

Once I start seeing webgoat 2.0 code, I'll bring up netgoat to the same
level of insecurity. :-)

Thanks,
Andrew

Excellent stuff Bill. 

I know the OWASP Testing project draft is getting close to a first
release and they will have some great text on all of these issues that
we should co-ordinate with. I think the two projects are very close
cousins ie one explains exactly how to test for a specific problem and
the other takes you through an interactive tutorial showing you how and
giving you a chance to actually do it.

I think maybe a cover page when you first start up WebGoat explaining
how you can use a proxy tool to do the testing maybe a good idea. Maybe
we can create a one landing page that explains the project, the history
of the Aspect guys creating it and how it can be used, future plans etc.
btw Steve Taylors Open Proxy (part of WebScarab) is now in final
debugging. Could even include it in the distribution I guess.

I wonder if its possible to use say a ZeroG installer and install
Tomcat, a JRE and this for those that are really not familiar with
things ? I know its dumbing it down but .....Also if youve ever played
with U-Portal (www.ja-sig.org) they have two ant scripts that start a
tomcat from the dll dir and start the database. Very slick, just unzip a
package and run the two ant scripts...maybe an idea

I will volunteer for the install guide with screen shots unless someone
else is going to create an installer.

Mads

You are not doing anything wrong :)

The unchecked email may eventually send the email but it does not do so now.
Currently, we mimic what the user would see when opening the email message.
The exec'ing of a command should be commented out until the platform
independent sending of email is implemented.  I believe the results you see
on the screen are the same whether or not the exec succeeds.


The Parameter Injection page does not check the platform before issuing the
command.   You can either modify the source to execute a unix command:

ParameterInjection.java - line 43
    replace
       ec.addElement(exec("cmd.exe /c dir /b " + dir));
    with
       ec.addElement(exec("ls -l " + dir));

or put a platform check in the code to execute the appropriate command.  The
platform stuff should be fixed in the next release.

We noticed the Tomcat version problem a little too late....  Sounds like you
figured it out though.

bruce.

It seems that WebGoat only works with Tomcat 4.1.12 (maybe newer
versions as well).

I had problems with 4.0.6 but all went smoothly when I moved to 4.1.12

I encountered some oddities though

Here is a resume:

1) the 'Unchecked mail' page seems designed to run on a linux/unix
platform (you spawn sendmail). I haven't looked at the code but it calls
up cmd that is a windows shell. So that didn't work for me in windows.

And in windows you don't have the sendmail program :)

In linux:

ExecResults for 'cmd.exe /c sendmail mads at opencs.com.br'

Returncode: 0
Exception: java.io.IOException: cmd.exe: not found

In windows:

ExecResults for 'cmd.exe /c sendmail mads at opencs.com.br'

Returncode: 1
Bad return code (expected 0)


2) The parameter injection page that throws a dir listing does not work
in linux because it try to spawn the 'cmd' shell once again.

Maybe (most likely) I have misunderstood something

Do you have an idea of what I am doing wrong?

What would be the recommended machine architecture for running this?

We could prob set a security manager to allow read for os.arch,
os.version and os.name and then set exec according to the os installed.

I'll do this and commit it to CVS.
