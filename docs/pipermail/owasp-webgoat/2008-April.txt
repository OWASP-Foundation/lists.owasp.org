Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] help with http splitting lesson
Message-ID: <7cf657b90804020912r56322823t71c88d4f725c4b3f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

I hame some problems with http splitting lesson. I'm pretty sure that it
should work with:

?foobar%0d%0aCONTENT-LENGTH:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0aCONTENT-LENGTH:%2025%0d%0a%0d%0a<html>Hola
mundo</html>

In fact, I was playing with WebGoat one year ago and I think that it works
with this solution. Any idea?

Thanks for your help.
Best regards
Miguel

Hi together,

i'm bin4ry and i'm new to owasp. Pretty nice community that fits all my
needs for webapp-security.

Well, actually i am kinda stuck at the stage "Shopping cart concurrency
flaw" even though i passed the concurrency challenge before.

After reading through java code i wanted to ask, if it is intended that
Thread.sleep(5000); in line 299 is uncommented?

Thatswhy i can't proceed this challenge using the same technique used in
the challenge before.

Greeting from germany,

bin4ry

Hi there,

 

I've just found why the Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) lesson wasn't
working properly. The issue is on line 94 of CSRF.java. We have to use
statement.execute () instead of statement.executeQuery ().

 

Cheers,

 

Fabricio
