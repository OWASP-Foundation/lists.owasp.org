Hi all,
We've started the OWASP WebGoatPHP project,

It is intended to be a redesign of OWASP WebGoat using PHP language (instead of Java) which is more educational than reference, and also supports lab education / contests of the tests/lessons.

If anyone is interested in participating in development and/or testing, Please leave me an email.

https://owasp.org/index.php/WebGoatPHP

Regards
AbiusX

Quite awesome!

I also see .NET Goat, iGoat and GoatDroid in the works.

I hope you are happy, Bruce. You're old, tough, well-used mother goat is
about to have a lot of baby goats and soon.

Aloha,
Jim

Hi,

I just wanted to find out if this was intended for the email list
address or for me personally.  If it was intended for me personally,
the attachment with instructions did not come through.

Thanks,

Caden
