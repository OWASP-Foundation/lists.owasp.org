<PRE>You may all noticed I subscribed y'all to the OWASP-WebGoat mailing
list. You should have all got details of how to set your subscription to
digest etc by now.

If the code is not yet in the CVS it will be very very soon.

I wanted to start by saying thanks and &quot;hats off&quot; to Jeff Williams and
Bruce Mayhew of Aspect Security. I spent most of Saturday night playing
with WebGoat V2 and I gotta say its amazing. What a fanatastic tool ! My
wife was most impressed and I am telling you that really is something.
She sat there for an hour doing the lessons. 

I just dropped a war into my webapps dir and away I went. The wole
concept and way you've written it is just so damn cool. Its
extensibility and design make it the perfect platform in my opinion from
which to continue your great work. I for one am really looking forward
to working with you guys. You clearly know your stuff !

I know Bill's not back from vacation yet, but I also think given the
significant leap forward from Version 1 we should release this as a Beta
1 release now and plan for a final 2.0 release before the end of the
year. I am always impatient but getting this out, especially ahead of
this Weds press release will ensure it gets the exposure it deserves.
You guys have clearly put in a lot of effort, have been great to chat to
and this lines up with the OWASP GPL and Free Software Foundation
philosophy perfectly so I want to return the efforts by getting your
company any exposure we possibly can.

If no one has any objections I will make some screen captures and do
some basic page layout for the WebGoat tab tomorow, and link it to the
WebGoat 2.0 Beta 1 package at Sourceforge for download.

When Bill returns from galavanting in the South Pacific well start the
process of figuring out next steps.

Once again thanks to Aspect Security and its so great to have you guys
aboard.

Mark
