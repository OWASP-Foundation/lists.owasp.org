Seems like a strange question, but ive spent 3 days looking around and I
cant find the answer. 

 

To get the login.java file to recompile ive tried editing in eclipse and
restarting Tomcat.  But cant seem to get the code to recompile..  

 

Am I missing a basic step?  Is there a guide to help the non-java savy to
complete this lab?   I understand the code but im stuck in enabling the
server code update.

 

Kind regards,

 

Terry U.

Is the server setup for hot deploy? Typically the case with server projects inside Eclipse, look for a Server tab in bottom panel, right click and check state & settings. If it's not you'll probably have to build a war file (web archive) and deploy it on Tomcat. That's the production way, unlikely for a lab.

Otherwise I've actually had my second worst computer experience with exactly this problem. The battery to the system clock had gone flat resetting system time to somewhere in the seventies. This led to Tomcat thinking all my code updates were older than the currently deployed version. Imagine the time it took to find this one out.

Hi john,

Eclipse has the server tad and it shows started and Synchronized.  And glad to say my date is correct  :)

The file I'm editing is located at WebGoat.WebContent.JavaSource.org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.SQLInjection.  
Is this correct?   Apart from that im at a loss...

Thanks for the response

Terry

It was ages since I used WebGoat myself and I haven't got it setup. Anyone
else here who has recent experience with this lab? Clues as to why it's not
working?

Could you refreshing and rebuilding the project in eclipse and see I'd
that helps?
