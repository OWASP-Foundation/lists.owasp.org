Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] webgoat 8.0.0 release
Message-ID: <097C0F2FC260624586D38301C2E1A7592143CDED@US01wembx3.internal.synopsys.com>

I was wondering about the status of the 8.0.0 release of webgoat.  I see something tagged 8.0.0 in the repository but then the tags continue with M8 through M21.  Is the 8.0.0 tag a real release of some kind?

How close is 8.0.0M21 to the final release?  Are new lessons expected to be added and existing ones modified?  Or just bug fixes/cleanup?

Thanks,

Cameron
