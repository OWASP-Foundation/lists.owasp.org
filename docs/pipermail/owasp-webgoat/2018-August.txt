Hello,

For my own purposes, there appears to be insufficient information provided in this chapter to successfully perform the challenge/test, and there are no hints provided.

It should be possible to complete this test without having to install separate tools, but from what I have read in outside blogs about this kind of vulnerability, it does not appear to be the case.

Would someone be able to provide the solution and explain how I should have gone about figuring this out for myself ?

Best regards, Christina.

Thanks for your input, Christina.

You are not the only one to note this (I had the same experience) we
have requested more information from the contributor of the lesson (see
comments at
