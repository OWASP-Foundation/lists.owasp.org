Hi.

What to do there? English isn't my native language, so I didn't get what
must be done... Delete user without logging in or what?


Have a nice day

Greetings all,

   I'm having a problem getting this thing installed.  A brief perusal of
the archives makes me wonder if I'm just a raving loon as no one else seems
to have had a problem...or at least they didn't post about it.

   I've got the JRE and Tomcat up and running just fine.  WebGoat-5.0 shows
up in the Application Manager within Tomcat.  When I go to the specified
url:

http://localhost/WebGoat-5.0/attack

I get a 404 response from Tomcat.  What in the **** am I missing here?

If you downloaded the release version, it should be
 
http://localhost/WebGoat/attack
 
look in the tomcat/webapps directory to confirm the name of the WebGoat directory.  If the war file is named WebGoat.war the url will be the url specified above.  If the war file is named WebGoat-5.0.war then the url should be the url specified in your message.

THis is EXACTLY what I'm experiencing as well.  The Tomcat console
information is almost identical as well.

Any help at all would be appreciated.

Hey all,

   I wasn't paying attention to Bruce's earlier note I guess.  When I looked
at the output from the console I noticed the "deploying WebGoat.war" thing
and it all clicked.  I changed my url appropriately and I'm in.

Good luck to Kiril in getting the problem resolved.

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] DOM injection lesson does not work with Firefox!?
Message-ID: <687F148231CEBF449E6206E3FA7AAC3F4DDF65@hermes.iese.fhg.de>

Dear all,

when I looked at the source code of the DOM injection lesson,
I immediately thought "the solution should simply be to intercept
the response to the asynchronous request and replace that response's
body by some Javascript to enable the Activate button" - and judging
from the the hints, this idea seems to be solution indeed. 
So I set WebScarab as the proxy in my Firefox, activated its intercept
function for requests and responses, and typed a character
into the text input field of the DOM injection lesson.

However, nothing happended - apparently, there was never an asynchronous
request sent. I tried the same thing with IE instead of Firefox, and 
there I saw the request (the response body consisted of the full HTML
page instead of a single Javascript command as I had expected, but
let's ignore that for now). So, Firefox seems not to generate the
asynchronous requests correctly.

I then used a Javascript debugger with Firefox (the Firebug extension)
and set a breakpoint to the validate() function. Indeed that function
is called on every onkeyup event - however, its first line
var keyField = document.getElementById('key');

Romain Brechet identified these flaws a week or so ago.  He has sent me the solution and will be checking in the solution in the near future (they are NOT checked in currently).  You will need to get the fix from the WebGoat source at google code because the next release of WebGoat won't be out until the late summer timeframe.

Dear all,

when I looked at the source code of the DOM injection lesson,
I immediately thought "the solution should simply be to intercept
the response to the asynchronous request and replace that response's
body by some Javascript to enable the Activate button" - and judging
from the the hints, this idea seems to be solution indeed.
So I set WebScarab as the proxy in my Firefox, activated its intercept
function for requests and responses, and typed a character
into the text input field of the DOM injection lesson.

However, nothing happended - apparently, there was never an asynchronous
request sent. I tried the same thing with IE instead of Firefox, and
there I saw the request (the response body consisted of the full HTML
page instead of a single Javascript command as I had expected, but
let's ignore that for now). So, Firefox seems not to generate the
asynchronous requests correctly.

I then used a Javascript debugger with Firefox (the Firebug extension)
and set a breakpoint to the validate() function. Indeed that function
is called on every onkeyup event - however, its first line
var keyField = document.getElementById('key');
produces an error: keyField (which was undefined before that line) is
null after that line :-(  Consequently, execution of validate() stops
when the next line tries to access keyField.value (i.e. null.value).

1) Does anyone know how to get this lesson to work correctly with
Firefox
   2.0.0.3 (latest version as of today)?
   Perhaps (I'm not very good at Javascript) the 'name' attribute of the
   respective input field should rather be the 'id' attribute??

2) Is it correct that the response body is the complete lesson HTML page
   and not just some Javascript command?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Just for the sake of completeness: The same error (i.e. setting
the name attribute and asking for it by id) is also present in
the XML injection and JSON injection lessons.

Message-ID: <687F148231CEBF449E6206E3FA7AAC3F4DDFA2@hermes.iese.fhg.de>

Dear all,

apart from the id-vs.-name-attribute bug I reported yesterday
(which will be corrected in the next release, and which probably 
affects _all_ lessons written by Sherif Koussa as I'm beginning
to suspect meanwhile), I found a new (at least I think it's
unrelated to that bug) problem with Firefox in the Silent Transaction
lesson:

>From studying the lesson's Java source code, it should suffice to 
submit the right GET request to the application, no matter whether
from Javascript or not, or whether through XmlHttpRequest or not - 
simply typing
http://machine/WebGoat/attack?Screen=23&menu=1150&from=ajax&newAccount=1
234556&amount=11000&confirm=Confirm
should suffice to solve the lesson. Indeed this works when you type
the above URL into Internet Explorer; with Firefox, however, the
lesson is not marked as solved, and the response will take you to
the "HTTP Basics" instead!?

I hope someone can clarify this issue,
Holger.

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Web Service SQL Injection lesson: Got response with
	13 CC numbers, but report card still says "unsolved"!?
Message-ID: <687F148231CEBF449E6206E3FA7AAC3F4DDFAF@hermes.iese.fhg.de>

Hello,

I think I solved the "Web Service SQL Injection" lesson:

I loaded the WSDL into WebScarab's "Web Services" tab, set
the "id" parameter to a value of "101 OR 1=1", clicked "Execute",
and received a response containing 13 "getCreditCardReturn" elements
(the whole database, presumably). When I look at the lesson's Java
source code, any response containing more than 4 cc #s apparently 
qualifies as having solved the lesson.

Nevertheless, in my report card the lesson is still marked as unsolved.
Did I forget anything, or is this just a (tolerable) bug?
Do I need to somehow (how??) produce the usual web page in my browser
saying "Congratulations, you solved this lesson"?

Thank you in advance,
Holger.

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Forced browsing lesson: Simply add "&succeeded=yes"
	and not "/config"?
Message-ID: <687F148231CEBF449E6206E3FA7AAC3F4DDFD6@hermes.iese.fhg.de>

Dear all,

trying to solve the Forced Browsing lesson,
http://localhost/WebGoat/config
(as the final hint says) simply returns a 404 error. Looking at the
lesson's
Java source code, that does not even mention "config", but instead
checks
if a parameter "succeeded" is present and has the value "yes". So, I
simply added "&succeeded=yes" to the normal lesson page URL, and 
"Congratulations. You have successfully completed this lesson" appeared
along with the admin settings inputs fields.

Was this the intended way of solving this lesson? If so, the lesson
would
be essentially the same as the "Remote Admin Access" lesson. If not,
please
give me a hint how to solve it beyond trying
http://localhost/WebGoat/config.

Thanks in advance,
Holger.

Greetings all,

   I understand this:

The labs are intended to be difficult.  If you were examining a true
application that \
had a broken access control mechanism you would need to consider some
of the items \
below.  The hints in the lab are intended to guide you in a direction
of thought.  It \
is difficult to draw the line between "solving" the lesson and getting
the analyst to \
think about how the application should work and therefore how to
exploit a potential \
flaw.
If you send mail to WebGoat at g2-inc.com, I would be glad to send you
the step by step \
solution to this lab.
Bruce.

But in Stage 2 of this lab the goal is to "implement access control in the
business layer".  So are we now fixing the app rather than hacking the app?
If so, isn't a knowledge of JAVA required?...perhaps JAVA wisdom is
assumed.  My "wisdom" of Java stops at my coffee cup I'm afraid.  Time to
bookup I guess

for some reason I wasn't told so drop it again if necessary...just lemme

[Your original message made it through, by the way. Just no one responded.]

The intention is that the labs actually provide someone with Java 
experience (or someone who wants to learn how to write secure Java) with 
an example of how to fix the problem.

So, yes, time to bookup. Or Google.

I will be adding the complete solution to the WebGoat Labs in the "Solving the WebGoat Labs" document at google code.  I was hoping that the WebGoat SPoC project was going to address this...  I have been receiving many requests for the solutions.
 
The solutions to the labs require Java programming....
