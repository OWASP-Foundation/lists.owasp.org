Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] WebGoat Xstream xml deserialization vulnerability
	issue
Message-ID: <4oC3nceYA3L6ijEEC0TNE-3sAY1yOywCzjJNQZZxOTtolH1O_p0-PsRoU0lLD1ciX-V7teHGx4vpNoqdq_9xrC2WhsIuv_EjFlwkvm_bH2I=@protonmail.com>

Hello there! excuse me.

I am a newbie. I am having trouble learning WebGoat's insecure components. Lesson 12 Xstream xml deserialization exploits have been difficult. I have spent more than a month trying hard to solve it, but there seems to be no progress. What key knowledge should I learn to solve this problem?

Thank you! I am looking forward to your guidance.
