Hi Guys,

Been busy on the Guide re-write so I kinda lost track of a few things
(again
;-()

I think if I recall the last time I left this conversation we were at;

1. Its a good idea to have a .NET version of C#
2. Conversion of the original Goat does not make sense due to its
architecture; the fact that we would want to show .NET techniques and
libraries used in Java Goat. 3. We should keep the lessons in sync but
not try and keep parralel versions per se.

So that said and my realization about Open Source that you need one or
two people only to do the work without lots of cooks in the kitchen, is
anyone interested in just running with this and getting it done ? Only
requirements from OWASP part is the lessons would ultimately be "similar
/ in sync" to the Java version. Architecture, coding etc is all your
baby.

Please let me know.

I am willing to own the project and have emailed Mark and bill about it.
I have one developer working me on this. Any help with architecture etc

Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]WebGoat updates
Message-ID: <042b01c3768a$ccf52c50$0364a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

I've made some improvements to WebGoat. There's a new category based menu on the left (thanks Bruce). Also, a few lessons have been cleaned up a bit, and there are a few new lessons:
 - JavaScript validation
 - Role Based Authentication

And I've got a bunch more lesson ideas in the todo.txt file in the project root, but please keep the suggestions rolling in.  It really doesn't take long to put a lesson together -- the plugin architecture really works well.

If you'd like to try it, you can build from source with ant dist, or grab WebGoat-2.1.war from the dist directory and drop it into your webapps directory.

Oh, I almost forgot. I added support for Microsoft Access (much more realistic SQL injection).  That's how it's set up to run now.  If you want the embedded database back, you can edit web.xml in the WEB-INF directory and uncomment it. Let me know if this works for people as it hasn't been tested anywhere but my machine.  I think it should be easy to use any JDBC database you want now, just put the right strings in the web.xml file.

Team,

As you know we are in the process of conducting a survey on the state of web
security. Whilst we have a good response so far, the more data points we get
the better and more meaningful the survey will be.

As a project member or project follower your views are very important for us
to capture and we really need completed surveys from you all by end of day
Friday. Please take 15 mins and complete the survey to help make this
process a truly unique and accurate account of what you the experts think
about web security today.

The survey is linked from http://www.owasp.org.

Thanks

Mark

Ok, I'm pretty new to all of this so some of my questions may be simple
but please cut me some slack - I'm trying to learn :-)
I've installed everything according to the directions.  (My OS is
Windows XP)
I installed j2sdk-1_4_1_02-s1studio_ce4u1-bin-windows.exe and everything
went ok
I then installed Jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27.exe
I set the environmental variable JAVA_HOME to the installation directory
of the Java install (where the j2sdk folder is)
I then changed to the folder where the bin file is under java and ran
the command : java -jar c:\install_webgoat-2.0_windows.jar and told it
to install webgoat only (since I had already loaded tomcat) (Honestly I
tried it both ways when it didn't work the first time) 
Now I had read in the archives that the file Webgoat-2.0w2k.war wasn't
quite right so I used the one made by the webgoat installer.  When that
didn't work I went back to the directions and copied the w2k war file
over and renamed it, again it didn't work. 
I can start tomcat according to the directions (in addition to running
the startup.bat)  Now this is about the fourth time I've done this and
have finally gotten this far so in a way I'm happy.  When I surf to
http://127.0.0.1:8080/webgoat/attack I get an error message.  It says:
the requested resource is not available.  
 
Now I didn't follow the directions for building because it indicated I
could skip it if you just want to run, which I do.  
 
Two Questions for everyone: 
 
Do you see anything I didn't do that I was suppose to and 
Should I go and follow the building directions to see if that helps?
(I'll probably do that while waiting for responses) 
 
Again - I'm running XP SP1 right now so I'm sure that is possibly my
problem but I'd like to confirm that.  I have a red hat 8.0 box but I'm
just learning that as well so I felt more comfortable working in
windows.  
 
Any help you guys can be would be most appreciated.

Graydon,

Thanks for the detailed message. I'm running WebGoat all the time on XP, so I'm sure it's not that.  I think perhaps there's a problem with the .war file name and the url path you're using.  They have to match.  So if your .war file is named "Webgoat.war" then the path should be http://localhost/Webgoat/attack.  Can you give that a try and let me know how it comes out.

(Anyone on the list who wants to help test some new lessons -- let me know)

Thanks,

I have it working now.  Thanks for the advice.  One of the problems was
case sensitivity in the URL and once that was pointed out to me it
worked.  I know it was a newbie mistake there but sometime the obvious
is the hardest to figure out. :-)  I'll know better next time.  
 
I'd be interested in trying any new lessons you've developed.  Just send
them out and let me know how they should be installed.

Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Problems with Installation
 
Ok, I'm pretty new to all of this so some of my questions may be simple
but please cut me some slack - I'm trying to learn :-)
I've installed everything according to the directions.  (My OS is
Windows XP)
I installed j2sdk-1_4_1_02-s1studio_ce4u1-bin-windows.exe and everything
went ok
I then installed Jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27.exe
I set the environmental variable JAVA_HOME to the installation directory
of the Java install (where the j2sdk folder is)
I then changed to the folder where the bin file is under java and ran
the command : java -jar c:\install_webgoat-2.0_windows.jar and told it
to install webgoat only (since I had already loaded tomcat) (Honestly I
tried it both ways when it didn't work the first time) 
Now I had read in the archives that the file Webgoat-2.0w2k.war wasn't
quite right so I used the one made by the webgoat installer.  When that
didn't work I went back to the directions and copied the w2k war file
over and renamed it, again it didn't work. 
I can start tomcat according to the directions (in addition to running
the startup.bat)  Now this is about the fourth time I've done this and
have finally gotten this far so in a way I'm happy.  When I surf to
http://127.0.0.1:8080/webgoat/attack I get an error message.  It says:
the requested resource is not available.  
 
Now I didn't follow the directions for building because it indicated I
could skip it if you just want to run, which I do.  
 
Two Questions for everyone: 
 
Do you see anything I didn't do that I was suppose to and 
Should I go and follow the building directions to see if that helps?
(I'll probably do that while waiting for responses) 
 
Again - I'm running XP SP1 right now so I'm sure that is possibly my
problem but I'd like to confirm that.  I have a red hat 8.0 box but I'm
just learning that as well so I felt more comfortable working in
windows.  
 
Any help you guys can be would be most appreciated.

Hi,

I installed webGoat in my machine.After installation
when i tried to access the page i got Session error.

This is what i did while installing WebGoat.

First i instllaed Java (j2sdk1.4.2)
Then i installled Tomcat server.
Then i installed WebGoat in the webapps directory.
I restarted the Tomcat server.
I accessed http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/index.html
It worked fine in my machine.
When i accessed http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack
I got one Cookie from the server.I accepted it.
Then i clicked "Start the course!" Button.
I got "Invalid Session" error.

I check the log file "localhost_log.2003-09-29.txt"
It is showing "2003-09-29 03:36:10 WebGoat: ERROR:
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 0, Size:
0"
Error.
What might be the reason for the error ?
Please help me to solve the problem !!!!

Thanks
McEnroe

	Graydon,
	 
	Thanks for the detailed message. I'm running WebGoat all the time on XP, so I'm sure it's not that.  I think perhaps there's a problem with the .war file name and the url path you're using.  They have to match.  So if your .war file is named "Webgoat.war" then the path should be http://localhost/Webgoat/attack.  Can you give that a try and let me know how it comes out.
	 
	(Anyone on the list who wants to help test some new lessons -- let me know)
	 
	Thanks,
	 
	-- Jeff
