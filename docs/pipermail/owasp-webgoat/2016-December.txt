Message-ID: <AM3PR07MB12027AB4C202C545A2796941AE900@AM3PR07MB1202.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hi Everyone,



I am trying to use Lapse+ analyzer on WebGoat (Java) source code. I am not a J2EE developer and I have encountered problems.

I have installed Lapse+ in Eclipse Helios, it seems to work (there are new windows dedicated to Lapse are appearing in Eclipse: provenance tracker, vulnerability sinks and vulnerability sources).


Then, I have imported WebGoat in Eclipse thanks to the .war file (downloaded here: https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases). The importation works but sometimes there are observables errors in Eclipse IHM (inside the tree window).


Despite of them, I have tried the "find sources" feature but the following error occurs: "'Computing Sources' has encountered a problem. An internal error occurred during: 'Computing Sources'. Details >> java.lang.NullPointerException".


Has anyone ever encountered this problem and knows how to fix it?
Otherwise, has anyone have a J2EE project or code to test Lapse with?



Thanks.

You probably want to grab the source code from the GitHub. Try cloning the
project from Github. After cloning you can import an existing Maven
project. The Readme for WebGoat in GitHub will walk you through it.

Let us know if you have questions as that would imply the Readme is not
clear and needs to be updated. The latest version is on the develop branch.
The master branch is WebGoat 7.

Thanks,

 As I was mentioning, I use WebGoat as a reference app for pipeline
development/training for customers during cloud adoptions. This includes
target environments AWS, K8, GCP, and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

I have none-corporate owned assets for AWS (from being a former AWS
trainer) that "Poofs" into existence CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, CodeBuild,
Application Load Balancers, EC2 instances (none docker), and EC2/ECS/ECR
(for docker version).  They are the latest versions of the cloudformation
templates from the  AppSec2015 1-day class I hosted.

There is no reason for others to not have these.

Thoughts?

So, if you and your team wouldn't mind I will make some feature branches
that include said templates for AWS and other QuickStart type items for
other platforms like Pivotal Cloud Foundry and pipelines solutions like
concourse.

I have much of this material laying around and I use WebGoat alot as a
reference application for build automation, selenium tests and as a OWASP
Target. There is no point and keeping all that private if the greater OWASP
community could benefit.

Thoughts?

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] hot-loading java fixes?
Message-ID: <46DF0C5F-F590-4E98-8D83-0D44A4073186@gmail.com>

Hi,

What?s the best way to load Java fixes to WebGoat? Can it do hot-loading?

I cloned the git repos for web goat and the lessons then followed the instructions on the master branch (commit 45d48a8, Date: Fri Dec 23 15:58:09 2016). Running web goat with burp proxy and firefox is working. Changes to JSPs reload automatically as expected. 

But I?m not sure which Java files should be modified for fixes or how to get them to load smoothly. For example, I thought I could just modify `WebGoat/webgoat-container/src/main/webapp/plugin_extracted/org/owasp/webgoat/plugin/rollbased/RoleBasedAccessControl.java` but it appears reloading the lessons extracts the original over my changes.

Do I have to make changes in the WebGoat-Lessons project, package and copy them to the WebGoat project every time? Or is there some way to do hot-loading / hot-swapping?

Thanks!
-Chris

Thanks Bruce.

I also noticed that building the lesson jars, copying to right location, and reloading with `http://localhost:8081/WebGoat/service/reloadplugins.mvc` made the Java part kick in but then caused the JSP to fail on compile saying it could not find the class which the Java change was in. ? Sorry for the convoluted sentence, but it looks (wild first guess) like the JSP was in a different class loader. Restarting tomcat completely worked..

Hi Christofer,

Indeed the reloading only works for lessons which do need a JSP to display the lesson. Majority of the lessons do not depend on JSP.
Reloading of classes together with JSP is very difficult due to the fact that the compiler inside Tomcat is not build to be open and it differs for each container. In the end we decided to focus on moving away from JSPs and start building WebGoat 8.0
