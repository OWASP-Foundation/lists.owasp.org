Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Scanner result variability for webgoat
Message-ID: <1797684880.323482.1412376157822.JavaMail.yahoo@jws100135.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi There,
I am evaluating different scanners ( Skipfish, Qualys etc. ) against WebGoat. The variability in number of vulnerabilities found ( esp. in XSS category ) is very large between multiple scans, across all scanners. Each scan ( same scanner ) finds a different number of vulnerabilities. Understand this could totally be a scanner problem. But just checking if anybody has faced similar issues and have figured out why ? I have tried restarting Webgoat and the machine too, between scans, but didn't help.
Thanks in advance,Sonu

All

Hopefully everyone is aware of the recent activity on WebGoat 6 including
the release of WebGoat 6.0.1 (webgoat.github.io).

The team has decided to use the WebGoat mailing list as a means to
communicate, and have a record of, the activities that are currently in
progress.  With the stabilization of the new WebGoat container we are now
focusing on:

Internationalization
Lesson Plugin Architecture (
https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/wiki/Plugin-Architecture)
Separation of view/controller in existing lessons
Updating the Github site.

We want to allow everyone to see the emails and decisions the team is
making.  Please feel free to comment or jump in and help.

Need thoughts on the new webgoat plugin architecture. Each lesson will be a
webgoat plugin.

Additionally we may want to add other functionality besides lessons as
plugns.

Initial thoughts on layout:
https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/wiki/Plugin-Architecture

My question is, since we are considering groovy for the lesson controllers,
does it make sense to look at Grails or is this overkill? On the plus side,
grails provides a plugin architecture already as well as other scaffolding
out of the box. On the down side, it can have a bit of a learning curve and
I don't think any of the current webgoat team has significant experience
with it.

Thanks,
Rick
