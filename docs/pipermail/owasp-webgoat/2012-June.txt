Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Problem with WebGoat 5.4 standard error needs jdk
	1.5
Message-ID: <1339900134.53065.YahooMailNeo@web114602.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi there,

I have been trying to get WebGoat 5.4 standard edition working on my Ubuntu 11.10 but every time I execute <./webgoat.sh start8080> it throws me an error of <"Please set JAVA_HOME to a Java 1.5 JDK install">. In addition, since java version 1.5 is obsoleat, I am having a hard time obtaining such a version. I was wondering if there is any way that we can make it work for the java versions 1.6. or 1.7?

Just to make sure... we don't need to install tomcat or any java/openjdk versons on our computer... The standard version of WebGoat should work when it is extracted.

Also to clearify for the following installation direction for the WebGoat: 

	* Extract the file to a WebGoat root directory of your choosing 
	* The WebGoat zip file has a WebGoat-X.X root folder 


So if I download the WebGoat file in my ../Desktop/Download/ folder, I can extract it in the same folder and have to run/executed from there and I should not be having any problems... am I correct?



Thank you for taking your time in answering my questions,
-DMan.

Hi Abbas,

I tried what you asked of me to do... and it still didn't work. I don't know what else I should do... I am just trying to get the standard version of the WebGoat up an running. I used up my whole day yesterday but it still didn't have any succcess... I think there might be a bug in the WebGoat program. Where should not be a hard-coded java version requirement as versions to change and the old ones gets obsoleat.?

Thank you,
DMan.

Hello DMan,
As far as I remember, I ran it like that a few months ago.
Go ahead and do so, if it still failed, let me know so that I can seek another working method.
Sincerely
Abbas

Thank you,

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] can't run webgoat on ubuntu server 12.04
Message-ID: <CAK0tQAHok4nX62itQ4Ozd047LGDGU3TW9L22qBv1KTwmRfScLg@mail.gmail.com>

Using the "deploy with .war" section of the README, as the google code site
seems to have all old-style installations deprecated. (Where "old style" is
using "sh webgoat.sh start80").

tomcat and java seem to be working, as I get to the authentication screen.
"guest/guest" and "webgoat/webgoat" do not work. (At first I thought this
was part of the exercise :P).

Browsed the mailing list, couldnt find a solution to my problem. Here's my
tomcat-users.xml:
root at tek:/var/lib/tomcat6/conf# cat tomcat-users.xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="webgoat_admin"/>
  <role rolename="tomcat"/>
  <role rolename="webgoat_user"/>
  <role rolename="role1"/>
  <role rolename="standard"/>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <user username="webgoat" password="webgoat" roles="webgoat_admin"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat"/>
  <user username="role1" password="tomcat" roles="role1"/>
  <user username="both" password="tomcat" fullName=""/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin,manager"/>
  <user username="guest" password="guest" roles="webgoat_user"/>
</tomcat-users>

Can anyone help?

Thanks,
