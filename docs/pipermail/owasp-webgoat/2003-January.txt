Steve - where can I pick up a copy of Open Proxy?  I need to generate
screen shots for the userguide this weekend and it's better if I use

Agreed - the testing guide isn't out yet, so it would be premature to
start using content in the public release of WebGoat.  It'd be nice to
get them synchronised and a new WebGoat released around the time of the
guide - not sure of timescales tho :)

Sure - I'm going to draft it this weekend, and will pump it into CVS for
review.  Since the guide will consist of new pages, we'll have to decide
where it'll go.

Hi Glyn,

I'm still working on the webscarab, but will release
the OpenProxy and SockScanner over the weekend.  I'm
going to put the OpenProxy out now as a standalone,
and worry with the integration with the rest of the
webscarab utils later.  All you guys need now for
documenting the process is the proxy, right?  I'm
hoping that the gui will make easy work of using the
tool as I have embedded tooltips on _most_ of the
controls on the forms.  The standalone version reads
the browser requests to open a socket, but the
integrated / webscarab version will key off a common
targetURL used by the spider, sock scanner, etc.

Will this work for you in the near term?

Kind regards,

Yeah - just the proxy for now.  I usually use Odysseus which is a proxy
interceptor/logger so as long as that functionality is ready in
OpenProxy it'll do nicely :)

Sounds cool - bring it on!

All

The unix and windows installers have been submitted.  There are a few quirks regarding directory selection.  Just make sure you either use the browse button to change the directory selection or hit the return key after changing the directory entry manually. 

I also fixed the platform dependent command execution in the lessons as well as a few other minor items.

Give them a try!  ( BTW: I didn't have a unix box to test the final unix installer on, there could still be some problems :) )

And you!  Mine wasn't that restful, tho ;)  

The doc I sent yesterday (UserGuide0.2.sxw - email dated January 2002!)
is different from the one I sent before Christmas (AppAssessment0.3.doc)
- I've removed all the lesson and OWASP guide related stuff, and added
in sections about using the Goat & required tools.

I think there are a number of different documents getting fudged
together:
1/ Installation Guide
2/ Basic User Guide
3/ Lessons, plans & hints
4/ Future additions

O User guide is the draft I sent over.
O I have alluded to a separate Install doc in the User Guide.  It might
be best coming from Bruce as he wrote the installers, or I can write
one.  *** I don't have a JDE/apache equipped UNIX box tho, and can't
build one this week ***
O Lesson plans etc are in the application at present - and I feel that's
the best place for the full detailed versions.  Perhaps the lessons
plans in WebGoat should include full information, but there should be a
summary (e.g. just the overview and objectives) of each in the guide.
O Future additions - not sure of the value of pushing the ideas from the
AppAssessment doc yet - that will change based on the OWASP testing
guide release and peer review from the rest of the list.  I'm happy to
prepare a draft for comment after release of V2 and the Testing Guide.

A lot of the structure depends where the guide/other docs are to live.
If it's in a readme type document included with the package, it makes
sense.  If it's to be the first html page presented to users when they
access WebGoat, it's probably less appropriate to have the install
information in the guide (hence a separate doc).  I'm always mindful of
the fact that nobody reads docs unless they have to - if the installer
is mostly self-explanatory, then they probably wont read the guide
before installing.

<snip>

I've not modified or added any at this stage - I agree that fundamental
changes like that will require a bit more time :)

I can run through the existing lesson plans and make sure they're
complete, but I think major edits should wait until WebGoat is
synchronised with the testing guide.

> Again screen shoots would be great for the guide. 

I think the lesson plans are probably best kept in WebGoat itself, but
screenshots may still be appropriate in them.

>           Lessons - (Existing lessons in Goat)
>           Furture lessons to be coded into WebGoat

I'm still mindful of pre-empting the testing guide - might it be better
to leave this until the next release?

As mentioned above, I could separate "future plans" out and have them as
a doc on the web-site, for example?

There's only a couple of screen shots required.  So long as users are
pointed towards the tools and given the broad hint to use them to edit
data in transit, they should be OK.  The choice of tool will dictate the
exact process, but the individual documentation should show people how.

All

Glyn pointed out a "big OOPS" and I have redelivered the installers. 

The hardcoded "mayhew" path for debugging has been changed :)

As a bonus, I fixed the modal dialog lock bug!

Message-ID: <BAY1-F199fJkVzZl4q90000b6a2@hotmail.com>

Hi, I just installed Tomcat 4.1.18 on my Redhat 7.3 box, and I'm having a 
problem with the installation of WebGoat.  I'm using Sun JDK 1.4.1_01 by the 
way.

When I run the installation, it gets as far as installing the WebGoat.war 
file into the webapps directory, then the installer dies with the following 
exception:


java.io.IOException: Stream closed
	at java.io.BufferedInputStream.ensureOpen(BufferedInputStream.java:120)
	at java.io.BufferedInputStream.read(BufferedInputStream.java:270)
	at installer.InstallTask.copy(InstallTask.java:122)

	at installer.SwingInstall$1.run(SwingInstall.java:162)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:536)

Any ideas on how to fix this problem, or bypass the use of the installer if 
necessary?

Now I'm confused as to whether the error is in the installation, or if I 
screwed up my Tomcat installation somehow (I don't see how as I use the 
RPM).

After installing WebGoat...


Start the tomcat webserver

Browse to http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack


Note:

There is a problem with the unix installer. It does not correctly copy the
WebGoat war file into the webapps directly.

Solution:
    1a) Pull the webgoat war file from the cvs webgoat/dist directory
    1b) or extract warfile from installer jar: jar -xvf
install_WebGoat-2.0_unix.jar installer/WebGoat-2.0.war
    2) Copy war file to <tomcat_root>/webapps/WebGoat.war

Hi,everyone

How to use the webgoat to perform a penetration testing?

Just as the lessons and challenge tell us, it is due to us to conduct
a hint of injection to bypass the authentication and access control.
But how to conduct a hint?

To run the installer...

1) double click the installer if your operating system supports it.
2) from a shell window (or dos window )    
    java -jar install_WebGoat-2.0_platform.jar

That readme file is used by the installer user interface ( which has the buttons :) )

bruce.

NOTE:  pull your installer from the CVS webgoat/dist tree.  The links on the WebGoat page are NOT current.

WebGoat was meant to run using Tomcat, it should work with other application servers.  You will need to discover how the orion application server handles war files.  There's a lot of good documentation at  http://www.orionserver.com/docs/ on how to do this. 

You will need to extract the WebGoat-2.0.war file from the installer.  You can do this by either

1) From a command window:

        You will need to have java installed on your machine and the "jar" command will need
        to be in your PATH.  ( set PATH=%PATH%;c:\your_java_root_directory\bin )

        jar -xvf install_WebGoat-2.0_windows.jar installer/WebGoat-2.0.war
        
        A installer directory will be created and the war file will be located there.  
        Rename the war file to WebGoat.war
 
2) Run the installer and only select the WebGoat distribution.
    Specify some temporary directory <temp_dir> to install it to.
    Install it.
    The war file will be copied into <temp_dir>/webapps

3) Go to http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=64424 and browse the cvs repository
    Go to the WebGoat project
    Go to the distribution (dist) directory
    download the war file.
    Rename the war file to WebGoat.war


When you get this working, please send me the specifics...  IF you need more help let me know.  I took a brief look at how the orion server works, but ran out of time.

bruce.

I guess this is where my source of confusion lies.  Where should the install_WebGoat-2.0_windows.jar file be located?  I put it in C:\jdk1.3.1_04\lib, but it didn't find it there.  Also, what does -xvf do?  I was able to pull a .war file out of the jar with WinZip, can I do anything with that?

The war file is what goes in your 'webapps' folder.  You don't need the jar 
to run WebGoat, it is just the Java Archive that contains the installer.

Last time I looked there we about 4 people on this list. 

Now its over 30. 

So welcome !

We have some bandwidth issues with owasp.org right now (we ain't got
enough) and we were planning to roll out a production version of WebGoat
this weekend with the user guide. The OWASP Portal comes online
hopefully early Feb (a Java based portal) and will be deployed in a high
bandwidth datacenter. We will have to delay a release until that time I
am afraid.

In the meantime I guess we can refine the Goat !

Whats everyones first impression ? 
What can be made better ? 
Anyone written any more lessons for it ?

I think that your exposure on Slashdot may have helped.  That's how I found 
WebGoat anyway.

Considering that I know next to nothing about web applications in general, 
WebGoat has been pretty fun to play with.  The main problem I've had is that 
Achilles seems pretty flakey for me, working some times and not others (I 
know that this isn't really related to WebGoat, but it's mentioned in a few 
of the lessons).

I'm looking forward to your production version with more documentation.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]How to create a new lesson
Message-ID: <006301c2bfc4$3a19cda0$7c64a8c0@fluffy>

How to write a new WebGoat lesson

All you have to do is implement the abstract methods in LessonAdapter.  I have
put together an outline below.

WebGoat uses the Element Construction Set from the Jakarta project.  You should read up
on the API for ECS at http://www.peerfear.org/alexandria/content/html/javadoc/ecs/HEAD/index.html.
In addition you can look at the other lessons for examples of how to use the ECS.



Step 1: Set up the framework

		import java.util.*;
		import org.apache.ecs.*;
		import org.apache.ecs.html.*;
		
		/**
		 *  Copyright (c) 2002 Free Software Foundation developed under the custody of the Open Web
		 *  Application Security Project (http://www.owasp.org) This software package is published by OWASP
		 *  under the GPL. You should read and accept the LICENSE before you use, modify and/or redistribute
		 *  this software.
		 *
		 * @author     jwilliams at aspectsecurity.com
		 * @created    November 6, 2002
		 */
		public class NewLesson extends LessonAdapter
		{
		
			protected Element createContent(WebSession s)
			{
				return( new StringElement( "Hello World" ) );
			}
		
			public String getCategory()
			{
			}
		
			protected List getHints()
			{
			}
		
			protected String getInstructions()
			{
			}
		
			protected Element getMenuItem()
			{
			}
		
			protected Integer getRanking()
			{
			}
		
			public String getTitle()
			{
			}
		}
		


Step 2: Implement createContent

Creating the content for a lesson is fairly simple. There are two main parts: 
	(1) handling the input from the user's last request, 
	(2) generating the next screen for the user.  
This all happens within the createContent method.  Remember that each lesson should be
handled on a single page, so you'll need to design your lesson to work that way.  
A good generic pattern for the createContent method is shown below:

		// define a constant for the field name
		private static final String INPUT = "input";
		
		protected Element createContent(WebSession s)
		{
			ElementContainer ec = new ElementContainer();
			try
			{
				// get some input from the user -- see ParameterParser for details
				String userInput = s.getParser().getStringParameter(INPUT, "");

				// do something with the input
				//   -- SQL query?
				//   -- Runtime.exec?
				//   -- Some other dangerous thing
				
				// generate some output -- a string and an input field
				ec.addElement(new StringElement("Enter a string: "));
				ec.addElement( new Input(Input.TEXT, INPUT, userInput) );
			}
			catch (Exception e)
			{
				s.setMessage("Error generating " + this.getClass().getName());
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
			return (ec);
		}
	
ECS is quite powerful -- see the Encoding lesson for an example of how to use it to create a table
with rows and rows of output.


Step 3: Implement the other methods

The other methods in the LessonAdapter class help the lesson plug into the overall
WebGoat framework.  They are simple and should only take a few minutes to implement.

			public String getCategory()
			{
				// The default category is "General" Only override this
				// method if you wish to create a new category or if you
				// wish this lesson to reside within a category other the
				// "General"
				
				return( "NewCategory" );  // or use an existing category
			}
		
			protected List getHints()
			{
				// Hints will be returned to the user in the order they 
				// appear below.  The user must click on the "next hint"
				// button before the hint will be displayed.
				
				List hints = new ArrayList();
				hints.add("A general hint to put users on the right track");
				hints.add("A hint that gives away a little piece of the problem");
				hints.add("A hint that basically gives the answer");
				return hints;
			}
		
			protected String getInstructions()
			{
				// Instructions will rendered as html and will appear below
				// the area and above the actual lesson area.
				// Instructions should provide the user with the general setup
				// and goal of the lesson.
				
				return("The text that goes at the top of the page");
			}
		
			protected Element getMenuItem()
			{
				// This is the text of the link that will appear on
				// the left hand menus under the appropriate category.
				// Their is a limited amount of horizontal space in
				// this area before wrapping will occur.
				
				return( "MyLesson" );
			}
		
			protected Integer getRanking()
			{
				// The ranking denotes the order in which the menu item
				// will appear in menu list for each category.  The lowest
				// number will appear as the first lesson.
				
				return new Integer(10);
			}

			public String getTitle()
			{
				// The title of the lesson.  This will appear above the
				// control area at the top of the page.  This field will
				// be rendered as html.
				
				return ("My Lesson's Short Title");
			}


Step 4: Build and test

Once you've implemented your new lesson, you can use ant to build and deploy your new web
application.  First you want to remove the webgoat .war *AND* the webgoat directory from
your webapps directory.  Then, from your webgoat directory, type:

	> ant install
	
This will compile your new lesson and "install" the path into Tomcat.  You only need to "install"
once.  If you make changes to the web application and want to test them, you can use:

	> ant reload



	
Step 5: Give back to the community

If you've come up with a lesson that you think helps to teach people about web application
security, please contribute it by sending it to the people who maintain the WebGoat application.

Thanks!

CVS access is back ( at least for me ).

If the installer you have is BROKEN you can download a working version from...

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/owasp/webgoat/dist/

If you already have WebGoat working, ignore this.

Hi all,
 
Just installed WebGoat, its up and running fine. I'm new to WebApp security
arena and had some problem with the "fail open" authentication part. If
someone could throw some light on this issue without giving out the answer
;). Just need some background info regarding the "fail open auth" issue.
 
Regards,
Kartik.

Hi Kartik

Without giving away the store... Maybe the Error Handling section (A7) of the "Top Ten" (http://www.owasp.org) can throw some light on it.

For the 2.0 release, we just need to update the links on the main page,
the webgoat page, and the downloads page.  There has been some
confusion with these links. I downloaded a copy from the downloads
page TODAY and got the wrong installer....


Some of the things I would like to see for a 2.x release:

    1) Categorize the lessons using the "Top Ten"
    2) Create at least one lesson for each Category.
    3) Create more complex challenges.  WebGoat currently has a whole
        bunch of "admin" features that haven't been discovered.  WebGoat
        also has the ability to enforce "roles" for each screen.   We could
        create some fun challenges with these features.

For the v3 release:

    1) Redesign of the look and feel ( We may have a volunteer for that )
    2) Create the "Test" architecture
            - extend the lesson architecture so that a test will know if a
"user"
                defeated a lesson.
            - The "Test" can ( but doesn't have to ) stand on it's own
without a lesson.
                In this case, the test would be filtered from the menu's but
would still
                be executable. This would allow some complex text cases to
be created
                without worrying about an end user.
    3) Create the "Tester" client.
            - Client will read url data from a flat file, execute the link,
parse the results,
                and generate a score card. We could get pretty complex in
the scoring
                by weighting the different tests.


Just some ideas...


bruce.

Wow, all very cool stuff. 

With regards to the download stuff.....the files in the release page are
not linked to the cvs tree. You have to ftp them to a dir and then pick
them up in a web app to build a release. We can kill the beta links etc
from the release and just have the final jars if thats easier. I think I
gave you Bruce perms to do it but let me know if it doesn't work.

All other features sound super cool ! And no mention of XST in site
(yippeeee)

Message-ID: <AA8E3CBBF6E2E7489931D9F30A7BDBD81B2270@zajnbnt006.dtt.co.za>

Hi folks,

What lesson are we trying to teach in part one of the challenge? Is the
intention to encourage people to run a sniffer at all times when they are
reviewing a web app, just in case the target decides to send them the
password out of the blue?

My suggestion would be for the challenge to go something like:

Tell the user:

"This is a banking site. You log in using your credit card number, and a 4
digit PIN. The card BIN number is 1234, and the number complies with the sum
of sums checksum algorithm. Once logged in, you can use your linked credit
cards to purchase items."

We then allow the user to enter 5 or so numbers (that match the checksum),
and give them "That account does not exist" or "Invalid card number" if the
check sum doesn't calculate. Then, once they have seen that the message is
indicative of the error, we define one of the numbers that they enter (a new
number) to exist, and give it a fairly simple password (1111, or 0000, or
something fairly close to the start of the range, to limit the time taken to
brute force it), and return an error message for that account that the PIN
is incorrect. That should then encourage the tester to concentrate on that
account (he knows it exists), and attack the PIN instead. (Alternatively,
use SQL injection to log in without the PIN. I like the idea of a bit of
brute force, though. SQL injection can be overused :-)

The next stage could present a shopping page, where the user has to modify
the price of the items that they purchase, by uncommenting a field in the
form containing the price. (The original site sent the price to the user,
but they got wise to that, and disabled that field. However, one can still
submit the field, and it will be used. The commented out < INPUT > tag
provides a clue to the user what field to submit)

The next stage could be to purchase something on someone else's credit card,
by modifying the userid (101) to return credit card numbers from someone
elses account. 

Alternatively, use an XSS attack to snarf another user's sessionid, and use
that session to buy something for yourself. 

We could allow the user to send a message to the victim, and "open" it with
a different thread, creating a new session/sessionid that should get sent to
the attacker's own web server. That might require that we interpret the
script injected, though. (I am trying to not give the user too much to do
that they wouldn't normally. I.e. don't tell them the other user's account
details and let them log in that way. Rather simulate the other user to the
best of our ability.)

Next stage would be to dump all the credit card numbers to the screen, by
building a suitably complex SQL injection. Make sure to show the user the
list of credit card numbers when you tell them that they have succeeded. (I
found it funny that the stage ended without me seeing the results!)

Final stage to hack the landing page is good. I like the SSI approach. This
could be done in the same way as the XSS injection, with the user sending
themselves a message.

The reason I laid it out like this is that it frames the challenge in terms
that a user would understand. It is possible that I am giving too many
hints, but that can be tweaked, if necessary.

Thoughts?

Rogan,

Thanks for the great thoughts. There are two ways to solve the challenge.
The first, as you discovered, is to run a sniffer to obtain the password.
This is a holdover from a course I used to teach that included how to
sniff a network.  I recommend running a sniffer during a penetration test
to capture all the traffic with the target domain and to see if the admins
detect the attack and attempt to attack back.

But for WebGoat, a more appropriate lesson is the second way to solve it.
You have to get the source code for the ChallengeLesson, which it sounds
like you've done. To do it, you have to be able to find the naming
convention and guess the name of the source code file.  Then you can just
look in it for the password.

I like some of the lessons you've proposed below and I'd definitely like
to get them included in a version of WebGoat.

Thanks!

submit the field, and it will be used. The commented out < INPUT > tag
provides a clue to the user what field to submit)

The next stage could be to purchase something on someone else's credit
card,
by modifying the userid (101) to return credit card numbers from someone
elses account.

Alternatively, use an XSS attack to snarf another user's sessionid, and
use
that session to buy something for yourself.

We could allow the user to send a message to the victim, and "open" it
with
a different thread, creating a new session/sessionid that should get sent
to
the attacker's own web server. That might require that we interpret the
script injected, though. (I am trying to not give the user too much to do
that they wouldn't normally. I.e. don't tell them the other user's account
details and let them log in that way. Rather simulate the other user to
the
best of our ability.)

Next stage would be to dump all the credit card numbers to the screen, by
building a suitably complex SQL injection. Make sure to show the user the
list of credit card numbers when you tell them that they have succeeded.
(I
found it funny that the stage ended without me seeing the results!)

Final stage to hack the landing page is good. I like the SSI approach.
This
could be done in the same way as the XSS injection, with the user sending
themselves a message.

The reason I laid it out like this is that it frames the challenge in
terms
that a user would understand. It is possible that I am giving too many
hints, but that can be tweaked, if necessary.

Thoughts?

Achilles is archived on packetstorm.
http://www.packetstormsecurity.com/filedesc/achilles-0-27.zip.html

I heartily recommend Odysseus - a lot more stable, and good performance
too.  It has replaced Achilles as my tool of choice.

Hi all,

I'm re-sending this user-guide for comments ahead of the proposed
release.  

It's a ubiquitous .doc file, but is intended to be churned out as html
from open-office for the actual release.  As such, the graphics look odd
in the doc but are 'full size' in the html save.

Hi,

Unfortunately, I am no kind of Java programmer, and especially no kind of
Servlet programmer :-( 

(I use Perl if I have to code something :-)

I can try to hack on it, but I don't think it would be terribly effective!
:-(

Rogan

P.S. I *will* try, but I'm making no promises

Hi Rogan

Great idea, Do you have time to code into a lesson for next release ? If you
need a copy of user manual on creating lesson plans let us know, as Jeff
said looks like u don't need it. (it should be on the site in a few days)
:-)...
