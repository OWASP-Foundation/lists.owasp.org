Hello,

I'm thinking of using Webgoat as a demo application for an internal
online course on web application security. I've used it repeatedly on my
own, but in this case, many participants would access it concurrently
("Now that I've explained session management to you all, we'll
have a ten minutes break while everyone hacks away at 
http://testserver/WebGoat and tries to break the corresponding
lesson there").

I assume all participants would use the same "guest" account. Could
this create any problems besides mixing up the score card (which 
does not really matter much in this case)?

Thanks for your advice,
Holger Peine

Hi Holger,

The easiest way to do it is to create multiple guest users, by editing 
the tomcat-users.xml file in the tomcat conf/ directory, and creating 
e.g. guest1, guest2, guest3, etc  similarly to the existing guest user.

Most of the lessons have been designed to be isolated according to the 
user that you "BasicAuthenticate" as. The only one that doesn't work 
right is the one I wrote ;-), namely the Predictable Session ID lesson. 
I originally didn't realise that this was possible, and have just not 
had the opportunity to revisit the lesson to fix this problem.

Probably the best way to do it though is to provide the participants 
with a "ready to run" version on a CD, which they copy to their local 
machine, and run their own copy.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Rogan

You should create a bunch of user accounts in tomcat-users.xml (i.e. 
student_1, student_2, ...)  This will prevent the students from stepping on 
each other while doing each lesson.  Some lessons are better than others in 
regards to keeping the user data separate but they all should work in this 
mode.

You can then run WebGoat in enterprise mode (web.xml setting) which will 
allow you to view each student's report card.   You will need to log in as 
webgoat/webgoat in order to see the additional admin features.

You can also use the lesson plans feature to add custom content to each 
lesson for teaching purposes.  All you need to do is overwrite the existing 
lesson_plans/lesson_name.html file with your content

Send me mail if more information is required

Bruce
