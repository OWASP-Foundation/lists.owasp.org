I've completed the install of Maven and Eclipse (m2eclipse) and need a
little direction in syncing to the WebGoat branch and importing the project
to eclipse. Can anyone assist?

Many thanks,

Cassie

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] WebGoat Help Request - Lesson: Challenge2Screen
Message-ID: <CACqxSpWpXxAVWTs=fDxGbFartVAGSjrzpymsC24F6DNecOoWQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

 I am experiencing a problem as the following:

 After i get the all the credit cards i get the error message as the below
and the screen does not load.
"Your mission is to break the authentication scheme, steal all the credit
cards from the database, and then deface the website. You will have to use
many of the techniques you have learned in the other lessons. The main
webpage to deface for this site is 'webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp'


* Welcome to stage 3 -- deface the site
* Error generating org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.Challenge2Screen"

I am running webgoat 5.4 on windows 7. I have solved the challenge before
and I have never got this error message. I tried re installing WebGoat but
I still cannot get rid of this error message.

Checked the FAQs and it seems people have reported this before but there
was no answer. Any tips?

Thank you in advance,

Ada
