Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Developing new lessons in Webgoat
Message-ID: <AANLkTinOaPSSpi_wU781mx3trd3WMag+sxj5CnGBJ98c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,
We are two students in a computer science and engineering school in Morocco!
We are very interested in IT security issues and we are a bit familiarized
with the webgoat project and so we want to develop  new lesson(s) in a
specific vuln/attack! We suggest our project to our school
ENSIAS<http://translate.google.co.ma/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ensias.ma&sl=fr&tl=en&hl=&ie=UTF-8>and
it was approved ( we call it a Project of the end of year). It's then
a
scholar project that will take 2 months!

Here are some questions that I wish you can help us with:
1) We want to develop under Back|Track 4: what java IDE to use and is their
any recommendation for the framework of java/J2EE and the OS in general?
2) Is there any new category of vulnerabilities ( and then attacks ) in
order to make a lesson of it? If the answer is no, could we just find and
extension or an other derives of a known attack!
3) Have we the right to commit officially our future lesson into the webgoat
project?

Other questions may come with time ;)

Any hints or recommendations will be welcome!

Thank you very much!

There has been very little movement on the WebGoat project for several years. We would love more help! Who manages and maintains Webgoat now?

Hi Yasser

It would be great to have you contribute to WebGoat.  WebGoat uses maven to
build and it is explained pretty well how to setup the development
environment in the readme.  The latest release (13 months ago) is in google
code.  If you send me your gmail accounts, I will be glad to add you as
project contributors.  As far as new lessons go, you can can do anything you
want.  I prefer to have real exploits and not simulated lessons because the
simulated ones generate lots of email requests when the user solves the
lesson and WebGoat does not detect it.

I usually develop on windows, using eclipse and maven.  I just set up a new
environment on Ubuntu in order to fix some of the Linux issues.  Both
environments work well.  Let me know if you need any help with getting
started.

Welcome to the team!

Bruce

Hi--

Normally before I post a question to a mailing list I consult the mailing
list archives to see if my question has already been asked.  I don't see an
archive on the mailman site, so I was wondering, is there an archive of this
mailing list somewhere?

Thanks,

Hi!

I am working through the WebGoat exercises-- they're encouraging us to
do them at work!? :D

I wanted to watch some of the videos at this link which is linked to
each page in WebGoat and the WebGoat info site at:

http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/training/webgoat.php

I tried some variations on it, and http://yehg.net/, but it is giving
me Tomcat 404 errorrs.

Has it moved?  Is it gone?

Thanks,

Caden

It does appear that the site is down.  I'm looking into it.  The lesson
solution files also contain information on how to solve the lessons as well
as the lesson hints.
