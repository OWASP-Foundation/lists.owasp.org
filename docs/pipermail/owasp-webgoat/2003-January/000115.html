<PRE>Hi folks,

What lesson are we trying to teach in part one of the challenge? Is the
intention to encourage people to run a sniffer at all times when they are
reviewing a web app, just in case the target decides to send them the
password out of the blue?

My suggestion would be for the challenge to go something like:

Tell the user:

&quot;This is a banking site. You log in using your credit card number, and a 4
digit PIN. The card BIN number is 1234, and the number complies with the sum
of sums checksum algorithm. Once logged in, you can use your linked credit
cards to purchase items.&quot;

We then allow the user to enter 5 or so numbers (that match the checksum),
and give them &quot;That account does not exist&quot; or &quot;Invalid card number&quot; if the
check sum doesn't calculate. Then, once they have seen that the message is
indicative of the error, we define one of the numbers that they enter (a new
number) to exist, and give it a fairly simple password (1111, or 0000, or
something fairly close to the start of the range, to limit the time taken to
brute force it), and return an error message for that account that the PIN
is incorrect. That should then encourage the tester to concentrate on that
account (he knows it exists), and attack the PIN instead. (Alternatively,
use SQL injection to log in without the PIN. I like the idea of a bit of
brute force, though. SQL injection can be overused :-)

The next stage could present a shopping page, where the user has to modify
the price of the items that they purchase, by uncommenting a field in the
form containing the price. (The original site sent the price to the user,
but they got wise to that, and disabled that field. However, one can still
submit the field, and it will be used. The commented out &lt; INPUT &gt; tag
provides a clue to the user what field to submit)

The next stage could be to purchase something on someone else's credit card,
by modifying the userid (101) to return credit card numbers from someone
elses account. 

Alternatively, use an XSS attack to snarf another user's sessionid, and use
that session to buy something for yourself. 

We could allow the user to send a message to the victim, and &quot;open&quot; it with
a different thread, creating a new session/sessionid that should get sent to
the attacker's own web server. That might require that we interpret the
script injected, though. (I am trying to not give the user too much to do
that they wouldn't normally. I.e. don't tell them the other user's account
details and let them log in that way. Rather simulate the other user to the
best of our ability.)

Next stage would be to dump all the credit card numbers to the screen, by
building a suitably complex SQL injection. Make sure to show the user the
list of credit card numbers when you tell them that they have succeeded. (I
found it funny that the stage ended without me seeing the results!)

Final stage to hack the landing page is good. I like the SSI approach. This
could be done in the same way as the XSS injection, with the user sending
themselves a message.

The reason I laid it out like this is that it frames the challenge in terms
that a user would understand. It is possible that I am giving too many
hints, but that can be tweaked, if necessary.

Thoughts?
