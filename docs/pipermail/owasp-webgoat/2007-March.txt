Thanks Simon.  If we can get the feedback soon, I can put it in the 5.0 which will be released as soon as I can find the time to verify the build and upload it to SourceForge.

I have been using RC1 on OS X and, despite the program being
very promising, I have found that several lessons do not
work appropriately. I have the same problem with HTTP
Splitting. Copy pasting the answer (last hint) yields the
same result as anything else. I plan on sending pointing out
the lessons that seem to cause problems in the future, I
just need a bit more time.

Hi Simon/Tim,

   Did you guys tried to paste the hint:
"=?foobar%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:%2047%0d%0a%0d%0a<html>Insert
undesireable content here</html>" right into the "search by country" field?
please note that there are actually two requests being made (which is
essence of the attack).

Regards,
Sherif

I've received a barrage of requests lately on how to configure WebGoat to be addressable by the host machine IP instead of localhost.  This is a Tomcat configuration that is being overwritten every time WebGoat (i.e. Tomcat) is started.

In the webgoat.bat file, in the root directory, the following lines are executed: 

    delete .\tomcat\conf\server.xml 
    copy .\tomcat\conf\server_80.xml .\tomcat\conf\server.xml 

This will overwrite any changes you may have made to server.xml file that addressed this issue.... 

By changing the server_80.xml file (or by removing the above code from webgoat.bat, after making your changes)  you can reflect your changes to the Tomcat configuration.   You will need to change the IP address in the server_80.xml file to be the IP of the host machine.  The following connectors should be modified

    <!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 --> 
    <Connector address="10.20.20.123" port="80" 
... 


    <!-- Define a SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 --> 
    <Connector address="10.20.20.123" port="443" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192" 
.... 

where the 127.0.0.1 will be replaced by your IP.  In this case 10.20.20.123

Hi all,

I've installed Windows_WebGoat-5.0-RC1_Release and been having allot of fun!

I'm stuck on the Broken Access Control Lab : Role Based Access Control
section. I need some technical clues or even the answer on how to bypass the
authentication schema. I've attempted SQL injection in the password field
with Web Scarab without success. I'm at a blank.

I'm sure someone on this list has figured it out by now. Please help ?

Looking forward to your replies & thanks in advance.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <9cfc13470703122135v4f9dc0wcafcfc1b7bdd9428@mail.gmail.com>

HI All,

Can anyone email this me or this  list with a quick and dirty on the use of
WebScarab and/or Cookie Digger with WebGoat. With particular focus on
WebGoat "How to spoof AuthCookie" section. I'm not having success collecting
the cookie with WebScarab nor Cookie Collector. I understand all the aspects
of Cookie analysis, but I'm having problems collecting them with these
tools.

This will give me the skills I will require for analysis of other websites
with more complex cookie structures.

Thanks in advance.

I wanted to expand on what I was trying to specifically achieve.

I'm attempting to snatch the AuthCookie ID's with WebScarab SessionID for
analysis to attempt to construct a AuthCookie for Alice (the How to Spoof an
Authentication Cookie exercise). But first I want to collect the cookies for
analysis. I know I can do it manually but that defeats the purpose of
learning how to use this particular feature of WebScarab.

Here is the RegEx's I have tried but I keep getting "No Session ID found"

AuthCookie=*;
.*AuthCookie="(.............)"*.

Have tried many different combinations without success. Also, I have also
made sure the "From message body" box was ticked, just in case.

Can someone please help me out with this RegEx


Thanks again,

CGI Phantom

Do not use the regular expression field, and WebScarab will pick up all 
cookies.

If you do want to use the regex, use something like (.*). In particular, 
the regex does not include the name of the cookie, it is only matched 
against the VALUE.

FWIW, there is/was a better lesson in WebGoat for learning to use the WS 
SessionID plugin. I don't recall what I called it, but it was something 
along the lines of "predictable cookie".

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] load() error trying to run WebGoat
Message-ID: <45F92253.3080703@lavsecurity.fi>

I'm installing WebGoat to a Linux (Ubuntu Edgy) host with Tomcat 5.5 and 
Sun JDK 1.5 installed from standard Ubuntu repositories / multiverse.

I just downloaded the Unix standalone WebGoat.war from Google, modified 
the tomcat-users.xml and copied the .war file to 
/var/lib/tomcat5.5/webapps. No other tomcat configuration was changed, 
for example the default port 8180 is just fine for me.

However, when I start tomcat, WebGoat does not start, but gives an error 
in the log file:

15/03/2007 12:35:30 org.apache.catalina.startup.HostConfig deployWAR

Tomcat itself is running ok. What is interesting that I managed to get 
the login box the first time, but no succesfull login and afterwards 
tomcat just says that /WebGoat resource (or /WebGoat/attack) is not 
available.

Is this a permission issue (java.security.Accesscontroller was there 
somewhere)? Do I have to tweak tomcat webapps policy files? The 
documentation was, hmm, weak on these points.

Hi Lea,

   Do you have by any chance JBoss installed? Is it a plain environment?
meaning, is there any Java application (JBoss, WebLogic...etc) installed?

Regards,
Sherif

No other Java application servers are installed, just Tomcat. However, I 
do have some other Java applications there, for example Eclipse. Eclipse 
wasn't running though. I also have Apache etc standard web stuff 
installed, but not running.

The tomcat installation is fresh, i.e. I installed it just to run Webgoat.

This Ubuntu host is actually a VMWare virtual machine guest, but it 
should not  make a difference.

Any hints appreciated. Thanks!

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Assistance with WebGoat v5: "How to hijack a
	session"
Message-ID: <9cfc13470703171859h4284a80cx18be911886e08e06@mail.gmail.com>

HI All

I need a little assistance regarding the 'How to hijack a session'. I'm a
little stuck in understanding the millisecond part of the WeakID. I have
identified a session ID which is used by another user:

WeakID: 11616-1174050351671
WeakID: 11619-1174050351718

So I can assume that 11617-XXXXXXXXXXXXX is the "other users" session ID.

My question is, instead of manually guessing & submitting 47 differences in
the milliseconds, how can I use the 'Scripted' section of Webscarab to help
automate this process ? and is there an automated way to determine the
milliseconds automatically. I read your email before which you sent to the
OWASP-WebGoat list but I don't quite understand what you mean. Can you
please clarify ? English is not my first language.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

First off, in your example, you cannot be sure that 11617-XXX is the 
start of the other user's session ID. Note that your two possibilities 
are ..16 and ..19. The odds are good that you received one of ..17 or 
..18 out of order, so just make sure that you are working on the right one.

Next, there is a script in the ./scripts directory of a standard 
installation, that can be used to brute force the time component. It is 
called "webgoat-session-brute.bsh". If you are not using the -installer 
version of WebScarab, you can see the script online at:

<http://dawes.za.net/gitweb.cgi?p=dawes.za.net/rogan/webscarab/webscarab.git;a=blob;f=scripts/webgoat-session-brute.bsh;h=8970bc5f5c162ac56ce71a793fa3845064646697;hb=HEAD>

or (without the line numbers):

<http://dawes.za.net/gitweb.cgi?p=dawes.za.net/rogan/webscarab/webscarab.git;a=blob_plain;f=scripts/webgoat-session-brute.bsh;h=8970bc5f5c162ac56ce71a793fa3845064646697>

Hope this helps.

Rogan

Hello again Rogan,

I have been looking for that script for a while. It will help out in future
testing.

The funny thing is I actually completed the lesson manually!. I kept
fetching session ID's and attempted to find the smallest difference between
ID's. Then I just wrote a quick shell scripts to generate the other clients
session ID's and manually tested with WebScarab. Although, the script will
help immensely.

Thanks again Rogan.

PS. I'm still having problems with the LAB: Role Based Access Control.

All,

Can I get some feedback on the approach. After on as a normal user, I was able to view the profile of Jerry Mouse by intercepting the POST and changing the employee_id to 106.

Subsequent attempts to do the same, fail. Even valid attempts to view the profile return an error.

First, is my approach valid? Second, what my explain the issues I am having.
(Usin ie browser v. 6.0 on XP SP 2.

Although, I've completed the stage, I believe it was done so not as intended.

I logged on as employee_id=101, then viewed another employee's profile by modifying the post, and then modified the POST again simply changing action to DeleteProfile with appropriate employee id. This placed me at Stage 2 without really invoking DeleteProfile.java. Yes, no?

Although you did not have access to the delete button (presentation layer access control), by changing the name of the action you were able to execute the business function (business layer access control) which you were not allowed to see/execute.  This is the condition for moving onto to stage 2.  
 
The fact that you were able to bypass the data level access control and view another person's profile is not relevant at this stage of the lesson.  This will become important at another stage.  You must first fix the broken business layer access control in order to move to stage 3.

Hi Mark,

This is how I reached Stage 2 of Role Based Access Control Lab:

Originally my problem was loging in ! I didn't have passwords so I guessed
until I  realised the passwords are the firstname of the person (at least
that's the case for the normal employee's). Is this part of the lab exercise
? to figure out the passwords to these account ?

Anyway, once I logged in using the Larry Stooge account, I proceed to select
his profile on the list and view it using the "ViewProfile" button. Using
WebScarab to intercept the request, I changed employee_id = 112 and action
to DeleteProfile. The continued with the request. This will allow you to
proceed to Stage 2 of the LAB.

So now, I have no idea what to do in Stage 2 of the Lab ?  Have you figured
it out yet ? Can anyone please clarify what is required ?

Are we suppose to implement some kind of authentication code within this
broken app ? I don't know !

Hoping some brilliant person from this list can assist...


cheers/

Hi All,

I know most of us use tools to conduct the initial phases of web app
pen-test.

One tool which caught my eye was Wikto - Web Server Assessment Tool  by the
bainy bunch at SensePost. From the SensePost website...

" Wikto is Nikto for Windows - but with a couple of fancy extra features
including Fuzzy logic error code checking, a back-end miner, Google assisted
directory mining and real time HTTP request/response monitoring. Wikto is
coded in C# and requires the .NET framework."


This is a very useful tool and I personally think it's a must in a
pen-testers toolkit. Here are come of the features:


   - CGI checker - it uses Nikto (it actually uses NIkto's database)


   - Web Server Fingerprinting (via HTTPrint)


   - Mirroring, link, and directory detection (HTTrack)


   - BackEnd miner


   - SSL Support


   - Automated google-hacking


The first thing I wanted to do when I installed Wikto was start scanning my
targets with Wikto, but first you have to make sure that all the components
are up-to-date and a proper  configuration is being used. Easier said that
done (hence me sending this email to the list).

1. Acquiring the Google API key: You will need a key from Google to have
access to the Google API. You are limited 1000 requests a day.

One you visit http://api.google.com you will see many API's which Google
has. The one that we are interested in (and not mentioned in any of the
Wikto reference material) is Google Data Data API
(http://code.google.com/apis/base/
). Click on the "API Key" under the "Related Links" section, then follow the
instructions, click "Sign Me Up", follow the instructions again, click
"Continue" and you will see the Google API Key displayed .


2. HTTrack and HTTPrint  need to be downloaded from their respective
locations and installed. You will need to configure Wikto to where it will
use the executable.

3. The entries in "Update sites" of Wikto section need to be changed since
the  DB's and schema's don't exist in those locations anymore.

     a. With the latest version of Wikto (v1.63.2279.18538), the Nikto DB
updated is pointing to http://www.cirt.net/nikto/UPDATES/ 1.34/scan_database.db
this is INCORRECT and needs to me changed to
http://www.cirt.net/nikto/UPDATES/1.36/scan_database.db . So do that if you
want to get the latest Nikto Db

     b. The location of the GoogleHack DB is also incorrect. Actually, the
schema.xml file does not exist anymore in XML format. It is kept up-to-date
by Johnny but is sub sectioned and is in PHP format now. So, I had 2 options
here, one, I could of downloaded the individual GHDB and combined and
created a new XML schema file (without knowing the original format) or I
could jsut find an older version of the schema.xml file just to get Wikto
working then add updates when I had time. I chose to find an older version.
I found of at
http://web.archive.org/web/20060112052059/http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/xml/schemal.xml
 Yes, there is a Jume 2006 schema.xml intact and I downloaded it into the
Database directory of Wikto and it worked. I will updated the
schema.xmlfilled later with the latest updates from Johnny's site. But
if someone has
ALREADY done so, please share !

 c. The BackEnd DB updates are not available from SensePost anymore !
Can anymore assist, SensePost do you still update teh BackEnd DB files and
where can we obtain them from ? Or does anymore else have a recent copy of
the updated DB ?

Ok, so here is a list of some adventures you will have when trying to
configure and use Wikto v1.63.2278.18538. If anyone has any tips or anything
else in that nature which may be of assistance.

Message-ID: <9cfc13470703270611r76b42265n15decab3f841ee4b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Well it looks like another problem getting Wikto fully functional. A
Google API key is required to get the Google Hacking working and
unfortunately Google has made some changed as of December 5th, 2006 to
the key generation. Therefore the new keys do not work.

>From Sensepost....

                          "Google's API policy has changed in that new
API keys have no longer been issued as from December 5th, 2006..."

In fact they are being issued but they do not work.

So what I require is an older Google API key, one generated before
December 5th, 2006. If anyone is willing to share, I would much
appreciate it as I have a web application pent-test report due on
Friday and would like to test for Google Hacking vulnerabilities for
our client.

Again, if anyone could be kind enough to share their older Google API
key, it will make me extremely happy :)

Thanks in advance.

Best Regards,

CGI Phantom

Hi there,

Thanks for pointing this out.

We are aware of the majority of the issues and are currently building
them into a new release which will be released by next week Monday.

Herewith are some comments on the points which have been raised.

> 1. Acquiring the Google API key: You will need a key from Google to
> have access to the Google API. You are limited 1000 requests a day.
> ...<SNIP>...

Google's API policy has changed in that new API keys have no longer been
issued as from December 5th, 2006.  Although we have not made a decision
as to the search API we will be using to replace the Google API, the new
version of Wikto will include a workaround / stop-gap method to provide
users without Google API keys the same functionality.  More details will
be made available as and when we release the new version.

Although HTTPrint and HTTrack are great products, the new version of
Wikto will no longer make use of these external programs (ie: it will no
longer be necessary to download and install them first).

Wikto will be fully functional after installation without the need for
downloading and installing any additional applications.

The new version of Wikto uses a slightly modified Nikto db which reduces
the number of false-positives determined significantly whilst still
retaining compatibility with native Nikto databases.

Following the release of the new Wikto version, our modified Nikto
database updates will also be available from
www.sensepost.com/research/wikto/DB/nikto.db, and the application will
use this as it's default update path.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention - we will ensure that this is
updated in the new version.

We still update the back-end databases and they are still available from
SensePost.  This is the first notice we have received that the updates
do not work.

I've tested the back-end updates on the current version of Wikto without
any problems.

Please note that in order to update the back-end from within Wikto,
please click the "Update From SensePost" button first, after which a
number of options will appear in the drop-down list.  Select the update
option you require (ie: Full / Quick etc) and click the "Update From
SensePost" button again.

Ian

Hi,

Could anybody pass this lesson, using these hints??

Many sites attempt to restrict access to resources by role.

Developers frequently make mistakes implementing this scheme.

Attempt combinations of users, roles, and resources.

How does the application know that the user selected the delete function?

How does the application know that the user selected any particular employee
to view?

Note that the contents of the staff listing change depending on who is

 session"
Message-ID: <BAY124-W34A8A6D67870E0832C947BF86C0@phx.gbl>

Hello All,
 
I have been able to identify the skip in the WEAKID (I guess this occurs after every 29 steps). However I am still unable to brute-force the time component of the WEAKID. I carried out the following steps in WebScarab:
 
1. Using the SessionID Analysis Tab, I collected around 100 SessionIDs.
 
2. In the Analysis sub-tab, I found out the initial sequence part which was used by another user as given below

Thu Mar 29 17:21:32 IST 2007 15514-1175169092796 572796 40109
Thu Mar 29 17:21:32 IST 2007 15516-1175169092906 652906 80110
3. Then I used the script mentioned by Rogan in the previous mail with the following parameters:

Request Template: I gave any random number (As I did not understand the question "Which request is the template?")
Enter Sequence Number: I gave the initial sequence number of the ID which was skipped (Say 15515)
Start Time: 1175169092796
End Time: 1175169092906 (As I want to find out the match between these two times; I hope I am right here)
4. The script starts brute-forcing and after some "Trying..." comes up with "Success with conversation xyz". 
The exact conversation snippet is given below:

Trying WEAKID=15515-1175169092904; WEAKID=15395-1175168390796Trying WEAKID=15515-1175169092905; WEAKID=15395-1175168390796Success with conversation 378Success with conversation 379
5. I then tried a few of the WEAKID combinations with 15515-1175169092906 and sequentially increasing the time-component, but I am still unable to get the right one. 
 
Please let me know where I am going wrong. Also I would like to mention that I am not a programmer; don't know if that would make any difference :)
 
Regards,
Anant Iyer
P.S. Apologies for the long mail.

You can run the Tomcat server in Debug mode.  You will need to set a break point where you wish the execution to pause.

The labs are intended to be difficult.  If you were examining a true application that had a broken access control mechanism you would need to consider some of the items below.  The hints in the lab are intended to guide you in a direction of thought.  It is difficult to draw the line between "solving" the lesson and getting the analyst to think about how the application should work and therefore how to exploit a potential flaw.
 
If you send mail to WebGoat at g2-inc.com, I would be glad to send you the step by step solution to this lab.  
 
Bruce.

This is where you went wrong, I think. This "template" is used while 
making the requests. It refers to an existing request shown in the 
summary, that will have the calculated "WEAKID" inserted into it and 
sent off.

Obviously, you want to choose a request that would invoke the correct 
lesson. This is typically a GET request.

Correct.

Correct.

>     Success with conversation 379*

One thing you should note from the above snippet is that there were TWO 
WEAKID cookies sent. You should preferably use a request template that 
does NOT have a WEAKID cookie, since the script does not overwrite an 
existing WEAKID. (Yes, you could say that this is a flaw in the script - 
patches welcome!)

If you were successful, you should go to the summary page and take a 
look at the referenced conversations. If you view the details of the 
conversation (i.e. the HTML response obtained), you should see something 
like "Congratulations, you have completed this lesson". This represents 
you successfully accessing someone else's session.

Hi All,

I know most of us use tools to conduct the initial phases of web app pen-test.

One tool which caught my eye was Wikto - Web Server Assessment Tool
by the bainy bunch at SensePost. From the SensePost website...

"	Wikto is Nikto      for Windows - but with a couple of fancy extra
features     including Fuzzy logic error code checking, a back-end
miner, Google     assisted directory mining and real time HTTP
request/response     monitoring. Wikto is coded in C# and requires the
.NET framework."


This is a very useful tool and I personally think it's a must in a
pen-testers toolkit. Here are come of the features:


CGI checker - it uses Nikto (it actually uses NIkto's database)
Web Server Fingerprinting (via HTTPrint)
Mirroring, link, and directory detection (HTTrack)
  BackEnd miner
SSL Support
Automated google-hacking
The first thing I wanted to do when I installed Wikto was start
scanning my targets with Wikto, but first you have to make sure that
all the components are up-to-date and a proper  configuration is being
used. Easier said that done (hence me sending this email to the list).

1. Acquiring the Google API key: You will need a key from Google to
have access to the Google API. You are limited 1000 requests a day.

One you visit http://api.google.com  you will see many API's which
Google has. The one that we are interested in (and not mentioned in
any of the Wikto reference material) is Google Data Data API
(http://code.google.com/apis/base/ ). Click on the "API Key" under the
"Related Links" section, then follow the instructions, click "Sign Me
Up", follow the instructions again, click "Continue" and you will see
the Google API Key displayed .


2. HTTrack and HTTPrint   need to be downloaded from their respective
locations and installed. You will need to configure Wikto to where it
will use the executable.

3. The entries in "Update sites" of Wikto section need to be changed
since the  DB's and schema's don't exist in those locations anymore.

     a. With the latest version of Wikto (v1.63.2279.18538), the Nikto
DB updated is pointing to http://www.cirt.net/nikto/UPDATES/
1.34/scan_database.db this is INCORRECT and needs to me changed to
http://www.cirt.net/nikto/UPDATES/1.36/scan_database.db . So do that
if you want to get the latest Nikto Db

     b. The location of the GoogleHack DB is also incorrect. Actually,
the schema.xml file does not exist anymore in XML format. It is kept
up-to-date by Johnny but is sub sectioned and is in PHP format now.
So, I had 2 options here, one, I could of downloaded the individual
GHDB and combined and created a new XML schema file (without knowing
the original format) or I could jsut find an older version of the
schema.xml file just to get Wikto working then add updates when I had
time. I chose to find an older version. I found of at
http://web.archive.org/web/20060112052059/http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/xml/schemal.xml
 Yes, there is a Jume 2006 schema.xml intact and I downloaded it into
the Database directory of Wikto and it worked. I will updated the
schema.xml filled later with the latest updates from Johnny's site.
But if someone has ALREADY done so, please share !

 c. The BackEnd DB updates are not available from SensePost anymore !
Can anymore assist, SensePost do you still update teh BackEnd DB files
and where can we obtain them from ? Or does anymore else have a recent
copy of the updated DB ?

Ok, so here is a list of some adventures you will have when trying to
configure and use Wikto v1.63.2278.18538. If anyone has any tips or
anything else in that nature which may be of assistance.

Hi All,

Well it looks like another problem getting Wikto fully functional. A
Google API key is required to get the Google Hacking working and
unfortunately Google has made some changed as of December 5th, 2006 to
the key generation. Therefore the new keys do not work.

>From Sensepost....

                          "Google's API policy has changed in that new
API keys have no longer been issued as from December 5th, 2006..."

In fact they are being issued but they do not work.

So what I require is an older Google API key, one generated before
December 5th, 2006. If anyone is willing to share, I would much
appreciate it as I have a web application pent-test report due on
Friday and would like to test for Google Hacking vulnerabilities for
our client.

Again, if anyone could be kind enough to share their older Google API
key, it will make me extremely happy :)

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Wikto and Google API key problem

Hi All,

Well it looks like another problem getting Wikto fully functional. A
Google API key is required to get the Google Hacking working and
unfortunately Google has made some changed as of December 5th, 2006 to
the key generation. Therefore the new keys do not work.

>From Sensepost....

                          "Google's API policy has changed in that new
API keys have no longer been issued as from December 5th, 2006..."

In fact they are being issued but they do not work.

So what I require is an older Google API key, one generated before
December 5th, 2006. If anyone is willing to share, I would much
appreciate it as I have a web application pent-test report due on
Friday and would like to test for Google Hacking vulnerabilities for
our client.

Again, if anyone could be kind enough to share their older Google API
key, it will make me extremely happy :)

Thanks in advance.

Best Regards,

CGI Phantom

Hi guys..

Yeah.. The dropped support for the API has been quite a pain in general...
We have a (hacky/cute) work-around to the problem thanks to
ian at sensepost.com.

We will wrap it, and release it on Monday...
