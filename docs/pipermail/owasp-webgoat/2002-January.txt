Hi Guys,

Please find attached an OpenOffice doc of the proposed WebGoat user
guide.  It introduces the concepts involved, describes the need for an
OpenProxy/WebProxy/Odysseus type tool and runs through WebGoat's
features.

It's in OpenOffice format, and I've optimised it so that it saves well
to HTML - the pictures are distorted in the office format because they
are set to maximum size (for the HTML save).

I've not put this in sourceforge coz I've not set myself up properly
yet, and also I'm not sure where it should go - perhaps it should appear
when users browse to WebGoat/attack and have the 'start lessons' on the
page too?

Anyway, hope this is OK - let me know if you need more.

Cheers,
Glyn.
