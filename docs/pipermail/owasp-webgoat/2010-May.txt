Hope you all are well. 

 

We are looking for a trainer to deliver the Software
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model>
Assurance Maturity Model module in the forthcoming OWASP Training Course to
be held in London, May, 28th.  

 

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London/Training/OWASP_projects_and_resources_
you_can_use_TODAY

 

As you may know, this event is our first attempt to institutionalize an
OWASP training model.  In conceptual terms, we are proposing a Chapters
driven model with local Chapter organization in which the courses are free
for OWASP members, the contents are OWASP projects focused and the costs are
supported by a mix of funding i.e. local chapter budget, external
sponsorship, trainers sponsorship i.e. trip and/or accommodation paid by
themselves and local chapter members' sponsorship i.e. taking trainers in as
guests.  

 

That being said, if you feel comfortable enough to teach SAMM and have the
will and the spare cycles to give us a hand, please drop me a line.

 

Additionally, in terms of financial framework, for budget reasons we will
give preference to a voluntary/candidate currently living in the United
Kingdom and, in accordance with what is above being said, the OWASP London
Chapter will assume the flight cost and will either find an OWASP Member to
host the chosen voluntary or will pay his accommodation.

 

For now that's all. I thank you for reading this long text. Please do not
hesitate and get back to me if you feel I can clarify anything less clear in
our current invitation.

 

I thank you in advance, best regards,

Hi all,

 

As you may have already realised, in my email below I mistakenly referred
Software
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model>
Assurance Maturity Model where I wanted to say OWASP
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project>  WebGoat
Project. Please accept my apologies.
