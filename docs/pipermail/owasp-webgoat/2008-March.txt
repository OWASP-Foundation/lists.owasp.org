Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] can't get numeric sql injection to work
Message-ID: <0D8299A04960AE4C8906052835761AF10118AC19@STCEXCPMB02.corp.star>

In the 2nd  'injection flaws' section, lab 'sql injection', stage 3, I
can't get the injection to work. I log in successfully as Larry but when
I use a proxy to trap the POST request and change the request to 

employee_id=101 OR 1=1 ORDER BY 'salary' &action=ViewProfile, I just get
'an error has occurred'. Any suggestions?

 

Thanks, Jim

Thanks that worked. I took the SQL from the hints, someone should update
the hints to remove the quotes.
