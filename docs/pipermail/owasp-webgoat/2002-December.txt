I think its just integrated and syncing up the work from the testing
project with the WebGoat lessons we currently have (we don't want yet
another twist on things after all) and doing the cheat sheet. 

Maybe the cheat sheet could be a panic button ;-)

Re: Displaying "cheat" data.

There are three mechanisms for allowing the user to view additional lesson
information.

1) Lesson Plans
    - A dynamically loaded html file when the lesson plan button is pressed.
    - The file name corresponds EXACTLY to the source name with a .html
        extensions versus the .java extension.

2) getInstructions()
    - A protected method that can be overridden.  Any text returned will
        be displayed on the lesson screen, above the lesson content,
        below the navigation/control section.

3) getHints()
    - A list of hints that will return clues to the user, one at.a time.

If I were to implement a "cheat"  I might make the cheat the last option in
hints or part of the lesson plan.  I don't believe we need to add another
mechanism to display lesson data.

There are many ways to incorporate more data into the lessons.  We should be
careful not to add additional complexity for flexibility that may never be
used. Options 2 & 3 require the data to be coded in the source.  We could
use property files for this, but once a lesson is created how often will
this data change.

Yep - that's the gist of it.  If we can explain the concepts in the
lesson, then we should be able to get away wih minimal hints.  I reckon
a number of 'hint tokens' should be allocated at the start to stop the
'keep clicking on hint' mentality.  Of course, the hint process should
be subtly flawed so that as people get the knack of application security
testing they can get as many hints as they like!

We need a group effort to decide on new lessons - I laid down a bare
minimum number of ideas to at least cover each concept in the manual.  I
think with subjects like input validation we should use multiple lessons
with increasingly good server-side filtering to guide people through the
process of analysing and bypassing such filters.

I'll generate more verbose content for the existing lessons and pass it
around for comment.  I'd also suggest that, if people agree with the
structure in the doc I sent, we arrange the WebGoat lessons to reflect
the sections from the impending testing guide.  We could have the 'intro
to WebGoat' stuff as the welcome page, with the tools & basics 'lessons'
as the first couple, followed by the real stuff.

Oki - can I get hold of it now to get screen-shots etc?  Check out
Odyssues tho - it's pretty good (And is free.  I'm chatting with Shade
atm to see if he's going to GPL it)

Great stuff.

I'll chat to Steve about Open Proxy (he is CC'd).

I'll leave the lessons to you guys, although I think it may be worth
considering using the current lessons for the release due to resources
and time. One of the beauties of the way the guys wrote this is you can
just drop in a class and away you go, making updates very easy after the
release.

Could I ask one thing. You edit the html in CVS. Don't worry about
mistakes, thats what version control is for after all. This way we don't
get massive emails to review and more importantly the new portal will
build stable versions and dev versions of projects using ANT from the
CVS.

Assunto: Security Paper: Session Fixation Vulnerability in
Web-basedApplications


ACROS Security is pleased to announce the publication of a security
paper
about a new class of attacks on web-based applications that we named
"session fixation" attacks. The paper is available at

	[ http://www.acros.si/papers/session_fixation.pdf ]

and could be useful to all web applications developers and security
analysts. We will appreciate any feedback you might provide to
<security at acros.si>.

Abstract
========

Many web-based applications employ some kind of session management to
create
a user-friendly environment. Sessions are stored on server and
associated
with respective users by session identifiers (IDs). Naturally, session
IDs
present an attractive target for attackers, who, by obtaining them,
effectively hijack users' identities. Knowing that, web servers are
employing techniques for protecting session IDs from three classes of
attacks: interception, prediction and brute-force attacks. This paper
reveals a fourth class of attacks against session IDs: session fixation
attacks. In a session fixation attack, the attacker fixes the user's
session
ID before the user even logs into the target server, thereby eliminating
the
need to obtain the user's session ID afterwards. There are many ways for
the
attacker to perform a session fixation attack, depending on the session
ID
transport mechanism (URL arguments, hidden form fields, cookies) and the
vulnerabilities available in the target system or its immediate
environment.
The paper provides detailed information about exploiting vulnerable
systems
as well as recommendations for protecting them against session fixation
attacks.


ACROS Security wishes you a secure and prosperous future.
