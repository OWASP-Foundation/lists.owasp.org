<PRE>I have it working now.  Thanks for the advice.  One of the problems was
case sensitivity in the URL and once that was pointed out to me it
worked.  I know it was a newbie mistake there but sometime the obvious
is the hardest to figure out. :-)  I'll know better next time.  
 
I'd be interested in trying any new lessons you've developed.  Just send
them out and let me know how they should be installed.  
 
Thanks for everyone's help with this.

Graydon,
 
Thanks for the detailed message. I'm running WebGoat all the time on XP,
so I'm sure it's not that.  I think perhaps there's a problem with the
.war file name and the url path you're using.  They have to match.  So
if your .war file is named &quot;Webgoat.war&quot; then the path should be
<A HREF="http://localhost/Webgoat/attack.">http://localhost/Webgoat/attack.</A>  Can you give that a try and let me
know how it comes out.
 
(Anyone on the list who wants to help test some new lessons -- let me
know)
 
Thanks,
 
-- Jeff

Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Problems with Installation
 
Ok, I'm pretty new to all of this so some of my questions may be simple
but please cut me some slack - I'm trying to learn :-)
I've installed everything according to the directions.  (My OS is
Windows XP)
I installed j2sdk-1_4_1_02-s1studio_ce4u1-bin-windows.exe and everything
went ok
I then installed Jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27.exe
I set the environmental variable JAVA_HOME to the installation directory
of the Java install (where the j2sdk folder is)
I then changed to the folder where the bin file is under java and ran
the command : java -jar c:\install_webgoat-2.0_windows.jar and told it
to install webgoat only (since I had already loaded tomcat) (Honestly I
tried it both ways when it didn't work the first time) 
Now I had read in the archives that the file Webgoat-2.0w2k.war wasn't
quite right so I used the one made by the webgoat installer.  When that
didn't work I went back to the directions and copied the w2k war file
over and renamed it, again it didn't work. 
I can start tomcat according to the directions (in addition to running
the startup.bat)  Now this is about the fourth time I've done this and
have finally gotten this far so in a way I'm happy.  When I surf to
<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:8080/webgoat/attack">http://127.0.0.1:8080/webgoat/attack</A> I get an error message.  It says:
the requested resource is not available.  
 
Now I didn't follow the directions for building because it indicated I
could skip it if you just want to run, which I do.  
 
Two Questions for everyone: 
 
Do you see anything I didn't do that I was suppose to and 
Should I go and follow the building directions to see if that helps?
(I'll probably do that while waiting for responses) 
 
Again - I'm running XP SP1 right now so I'm sure that is possibly my
problem but I'd like to confirm that.  I have a red hat 8.0 box but I'm
just learning that as well so I felt more comfortable working in
windows.  
 
Any help you guys can be would be most appreciated.
