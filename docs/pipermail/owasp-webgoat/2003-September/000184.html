<PRE>Graydon,

Thanks for the detailed message. I'm running WebGoat all the time on XP, so I'm sure it's not that.  I think perhaps there's a problem with the .war file name and the url path you're using.  They have to match.  So if your .war file is named &quot;Webgoat.war&quot; then the path should be <A HREF="http://localhost/Webgoat/attack.">http://localhost/Webgoat/attack.</A>  Can you give that a try and let me know how it comes out.

(Anyone on the list who wants to help test some new lessons -- let me know)

Thanks,

--Jeff

  Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Problems with Installation


  Ok, I'm pretty new to all of this so some of my questions may be simple but please cut me some slack - I'm trying to learn J

  I've installed everything according to the directions.  (My OS is Windows XP)

  I installed j2sdk-1_4_1_02-s1studio_ce4u1-bin-windows.exe and everything went ok

  I then installed Jakarta-tomcat-4.1.27.exe

  I set the environmental variable JAVA_HOME to the installation directory of the Java install (where the j2sdk folder is)

  I then changed to the folder where the bin file is under java and ran the command : java -jar c:\install_webgoat-2.0_windows.jar and told it to install webgoat only (since I had already loaded tomcat) (Honestly I tried it both ways when it didn't work the first time) 

  Now I had read in the archives that the file Webgoat-2.0w2k.war wasn't quite right so I used the one made by the webgoat installer.  When that didn't work I went back to the directions and copied the w2k war file over and renamed it, again it didn't work. 

  I can start tomcat according to the directions (in addition to running the startup.bat)  Now this is about the fourth time I've done this and have finally gotten this far so in a way I'm happy.  When I surf to <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:8080/webgoat/attack">http://127.0.0.1:8080/webgoat/attack</A> I get an error message.  It says: the requested resource is not available.  

   

  Now I didn't follow the directions for building because it indicated I could skip it if you just want to run, which I do.  

   

  Two Questions for everyone: 

   

  Do you see anything I didn't do that I was suppose to and 

  Should I go and follow the building directions to see if that helps?  (I'll probably do that while waiting for responses) 

   

  Again - I'm running XP SP1 right now so I'm sure that is possibly my problem but I'd like to confirm that.  I have a red hat 8.0 box but I'm just learning that as well so I felt more comfortable working in windows.  

   

  Any help you guys can be would be most appreciated.
