<PRE>First off, thanks for the tool, it has been both educational and
entertaining.  I am, however, having some problems using WebGoat.

I've previously seen mention made of problems logging in.  I have had
no problem with this when going to <A HREF="http://localhost/WebGoat/attack,">http://localhost/WebGoat/attack,</A>
however, the User guide recommends using a tool called form scalpel
(which was nearly impossible to find, please feel free to email me for
the updated link where I got it) for manipulating form elements.  I've
been working at the JavaScript Validation lesson for quite awhile now,
and while I understand what to do, I cannot do it.

Initially I tried using Achilles to perform MITM Proxy attacks on
it... it was all good, but either the page would never finish loading
(whenever I tried to edit the page before it got to my browser), or
the program would crash (whenever I tried to submit the form with
proper data then change it before sending it out to the server). 
Failing at this I moved on to trying to use form scalpel. 
Unfortuntately, I have no idea how to load the page in form scalpel to
even begin working.  I get a 401 error no matter what page I try to
load (from WebGoat) and I believe it to be because of the necessity to
authenticate using the guest/guest credentials.  If there is a way to
tell form scalpel to do this, I am unaware of it.

If anyone has any other tools, or suggestions on how to complete this,
please let me know.  I may also be having some problems with a couple
of the others which I will address later if necessary.

If someone could email me directly, that would be perfect, otherwise I
will keep checking back.

Thanks,

Nathan McFeters
