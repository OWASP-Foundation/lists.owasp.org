Database back doors
Cross site request forgery
Log spoofing
Cache poisoning
Forced browsing
XPath Injection
AJAX Security
    - DOM Injection
    - JSON Injection
    - Silent Transactions
    - XML Injection
 
Please take a moment to download this release from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=61824 and try out some of these new features.  Please send all feedback, comments, suggestions, ... to WebGoat at G2-inc.com <mailto:WebGoat at G2-inc.com> .  The 5.0 final version will be release towards the end of January.  
 
I would really appreciate one of the Unix users giving the Unix version a test drive.  
 
Speak up now, if you have a suggestion... 
 
 
Have fun!

All,
 
Thanks for all the feedback on Release Candidate 1.  We are getting ready to release 5.0 and I would like to eliminate as many annoying "features" as possible.  Please send any comments and/or suggestions you may have so we can get them fixed for the final 5.0 release.
 
Thanks
 
Bruce.
