Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Role based access control stages
Message-ID: <freemail.20080010210858.83471@fm14.freemail.hu>

Hi,

i completed stage 1 of role based access control lab.
To implement the business layer protection i modified and compiled the  DeleteProfile.java file.
After that i tried to exploit the vulnerability the same way i did at stage 1.
I got the following messages:
 * Welcome to stage 3 -- exploiting the data layer
* Unauthorized!!!  <-- this is implemented by me.
* Welcome to stage 2 -- protecting the business layer

and then i stucked in stage 2. To find out how to step to stage 3 i searched the source code for the string: "* Welcome to stage 3 -- exploiting the data layer". Suprisingly i didn't find it.
Can anyone help me how to step to stage 3? (Beside modiying the lesson.)

Regards

Miklos

Check out the
org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.instructor.RoleBasedAccessControl package.

That should explain things for you. In fact, the only file you needed to
modify for Stage 1/2 is DeleteProfile.java

Regards,

Rogan

P.S. The text "Welcome to stage 3" is constructed automatically.
Grepping for "exploiting the data layer" would probably find it.

Message-ID: <9DF4DCB48693534A986B344B0BF89DDB026F434B@ligament.Ounce.local>

All

 

WebGoat 5.1 was released today at Google Code
(http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/downloads/list).  This release has
several new lessons and many improvements to existing lessons.  A new
"Show Solutions" feature has been added that demonstrates how to solve
each lesson and the ant build process has been cleaned up significantly
making the generation of "Teaching Distributions" an easy task.

 

I would like to thank the many contributors to this release, especially
Erwin Geirnaert and Rogan Dawes. 

 

 

There are now only two WebGoat distributions:  Standard and Developer:


WebGoat <http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/wiki/WebGoat>  5.1 Standard:


The standard release is a download, unzip, and click-to-run release. It
comes with the Java Runtime Environment and a configured Tomcat 5.5
server. 

*	Double-click on webgoat.bat - a Tomcat command window starts 
*	Browse to http://localhost/WebGoat/attack 


WebGoat <http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/wiki/WebGoat>  5.1 Developer
(Waiting for Google disk quota approval issue 649):


The developer release includes the standard release with the addition of
a configured eclipse environment. The developer release is also a
download, unzip, and click-to-run release. It works exactly the same as
the standard release if you only wish to explore the lessons. However,
if you want to perform the labs or use WebGoat
<http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/wiki/WebGoat>  in the classroom, use
the eclipse.bat to start up a preconfigured WebGoat
<http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/wiki/WebGoat>  environment. Detailed
instructions are include at the top of the HOW TO create the WebGoat
<http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/wiki/WebGoat>  workspace.txt file. 

*	Extract the Eclipse-Workspace.zip file to the working directory 
*	Double-click the eclipse.bat file 
*	In the Eclipse package explorer (top right), right click the
WebGoat <http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/wiki/WebGoat>  project and
refresh 
*	In the Eclipse package explorer (top right), right click the
Servers project and refresh 
*	In the Eclipse servers view (bottom), right click LocalHost
server and start 
*	Browse to http://localhost/WebGoat/attack 
*	Any changes made to the source will automatically compile and
redeploy when saved 

 

As always, please send me email at webgoat at owasp.org
<mailto:webgoat at owasp.org>  if you have any issues, comments, or
questions.

Hi,

 

thanks for the reply!

i didn't see the throws UnauthotizedException on the function, so i implemented the protection inside the try catch part of the code...

Within the first few lines of webgoat.sh, there seems to be a test for jdk version:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if [ "X$JAVA_HOME" != "X" -a -d $JAVA_HOME ]; then
                $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -version 2>&1 | grep 'version \"1.5' >/dev/null
                if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
                        echo "The JVM in \$JAVA_HOME isn't version 1.5."
                        exit 1
                fi
        else
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I do not know why this constraint is necessary.

Yes, the test should actually be 1.5 or later, since we make use of 
generics.

All

 

Google issues have a "star" feature.  I'm hoping that if enough people
"star" an issue it will get more notice.  I'm trying to get Google Code
to increase the per file quota for WebGoat downloads.  Currently the
developer edition is 370MB and the limit is 100MB.

 

If you care about this issue please view Issue 649 and "star" it.  This
will allow me to have both releases in the same location.  I know there
are things I can do to reduce the size but I've found, the unzip and
click style of release is the most user friendly

Thanks for your support.

Personally, I think that bundling the entire JDK with WebGoat is 
ridiculous. Unzip and click is all very well for the basic version, but 
one would certainly expect that a developer should be able to install 
their own JDK and set JAVA_HOME appropriately.

Also, don't you think that we may actually be deterring people from 
playing with the developer edition by making it so large?

Rogan,

I must admit that as a first-time, *non-developer* user of WebGoat, I struggled quite a long while with JDK version constraints and setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable.  I could agree that bundling JDK in the download seems redundant, but providing more clear, detailed installation and configuration instructions and addressing any issues JDK version constraints then becomes more important.

Yes, having such a large distribution is "ridiculous".

However, not all users are as adept as you are in building applications
and they simply want a pre-built environment that they can learn from.
I think the developer release provides that capability. 

Besides, a "true" developer is going to sync to the SVN repository :)

I agree with Brian - I think the true solution is just better 
documentation. Explain what the prerequisites are.

Installing a JDK and setting JAVA_HOME has *nothing* to do with building 
applications. That is just general computer literacy, expected of even 
the most newbie developer.

*Contrast*:

The WebGoat developer edition requires a 1.5 or later JDK to be 
installed, and the JAVA_HOME environment variable set so that WebGoat 
can find where you have installed the JDK.

You can get the JDK for your platform from 
http://java.sun.com/<wherever>. Once it is installed, either:

(Windows) Go to "My Computer" -> Properties -> Advanced -> "Environment 
Variables". Look for a variable called JAVA_HOME. If it is set, check 
that it points to the directory that the JDK was installed to,

e.g. c:\program files\java\jdk1.5.0_06

Unix (sh, bash, ksh): JAVA_HOME=~/jdk1.5.0_06 export JAVA_HOME

or edit your login files to ensure that this variable is always set 
whenever you login

*vs*

Users waiting for a 370MB download, installing/reinstalling that on 
students files, etc, as well as fighting with Google :-)

Message-ID: <478EA038.1000206@oracle.com>

Webgoat seems to be dependent on TomCat. Any pointers to making WebGoat 
application server independent would be much appreciated. If anyone who 
knows the code, please let us know how to change the code to make it 
work on other application servers.
Thanks

There should be no inherent dependency on tomcat. Although it is 
"required" to build the war, this is only so we can have access to the 
servlet API jars.

Once the WAR is constructed, you *should* be able to deploy it to any 
application server. If this doesn't work, please let us know (with 
details), and we'll make a plan to fix it.

WebGoat uses the tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml file for user and role
definition.

The WebScarab and Paros install just fine on Windows and WebScarab just fine
on Fedora.  WebGoat's problem is that the version on the download page is
5.1 standard and it has no webgoat.sh file.  Both the startup files are .bat
for a Windows system.  I don't know if they have changed it or I am caught
between 5.0 (that the article mentions) or I missing something obvious.

 

Thanks

Marco,

 

I work for Rich Knowles and he passed some info along to me for review.

 

In the process of reviewing things I decided to install WebGoat.  I have
this strange feeling that it does not currently install or run on Linux.

Do you know if that is the case?

 

Everything on the OWASP site seems to only have .bat files in it and not
shell files.

 

Any thoughts?

 

Thanks

Steve
