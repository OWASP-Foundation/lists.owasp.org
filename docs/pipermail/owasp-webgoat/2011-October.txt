I am trying this from booting the prebuilt virtual disk and I am having
trouble finding the server_80.xml file to edit.  I am sure this is
something simple but I have been searching quite a while and have come
up with nothing.  Assistance would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks.

I'm assuming you downloaded the latest version of the Live CD, right? Try
downloading the one before that here:
http://mtesauro.com/files/owasp-livecd-AppSecEU-May2009.iso because the
latest version has some bugs and it isn't stable yet. Let me know what
happens.

Regards,

Another option if you are looking for a pre-built virtual machine is
the OWASP Broken Web Applications VM.  It includes WebGoat (along with
a bunch of other applications).  Details and downloads at
http://code.google.com/p/owaspbwa/.
