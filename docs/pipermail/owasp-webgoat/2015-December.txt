Hi All,

It looks WebGoat's JQuery library is causing me some issues. When completing the XSS exercises, I find that as soon as my request hits jquery-1.10.2.min.js, <script>alert('boo!');</script> turns into .script.alert(.boo!.);.script. Hence, by the time the request leaves the client, it is unusable for the purposes of the exercise.

Any pointers?

Thanks!

Diana

Diana,

What version are you using? Some of the xss/csrf issues were resolved
recently in 7.0 development, but may need some attention still.

Also what browser?

Feel free to throw an issue in at github as well ...
https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat.

Cheers,
Jason

Hi Jason,

I?ve tried this with Chrome (latest and greatest), Firefox 43.0.1 and IE 11. I traced the issue to JQuery using Firebug. Also, quite notably, I have the issue in WebGoat version 7 and in version 6.


-        I also upgraded JQuery to the latest version, but this did not resolve the issue.

Could this be because I am running WebGoat on a remote Linux server and accessing it from my Windows workstation? I?m not sure why I would have this issue and others would not.

Thanks for your help!

Diana
