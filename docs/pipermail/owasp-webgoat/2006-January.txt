Since there has not been any response to my message, I figured I'd go
ahead and forward the updated .java file.  It should work on both
Windows and Unix.  The only thing missing is that I don't know how to
solve the lesson on Unix (using the InstantDB database) so I can't
write the hints.  Let me know if you have any problems running this
lesson. Also, let me know if you solve the lesson on Unix and tell me
how you did it.  Thanks all.

Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]linux install question

Hello.  I got webgoat up and running on windows and I must say it is a
great product.  

 

In trying to install on Linux,  from the zip file, I get nothing.  After
su to root, I run command sh webgoat.sh start

And I see 

 

Using CATALINA_BASE:  ./tomcat

Using CATALINA_HOME:  ./tomcat

Using CATALINA_TMPDIR:  ./tomcat/temp

Using JAVA_HOME:  /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06/

 

 

But the server does not seem to start correctly:

when I go to http://localhost/WebGoat/attack

I get a server error:  Could not connect to host localhost

 

And when I got to http://localhost/

Same thing.

 

If I check processes, I see a java process, but no tomcat process.
(should I see a tomcat process?) 

 

Is my java home correct?  And if I already have and environment variable
for JAVA_HOME pointing at a different java version, is that a problem?

 

Tim
