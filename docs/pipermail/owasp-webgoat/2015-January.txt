I am skeptical that my subscription is working on this list, so I am
sending out a test message to the list to see for sure.

Second, having taken on a lead role for the UI component of WebGoat, I am
still looking for volunteers/helpers.  Great expertise is not required,
after all the pay is kind of shoddy, right? Just general experience in UI
work (html, css, javascript ... does not have to be AngularJS)

We pushed out 6.0 using mostly angularJS and some jQuery to sprinkle/fill
the holes. I am not convinced that we should/will be using Angular for the
next iteration, but we do need to (at least I prefer to) use something that
supports

* client-side routing/deep-linking (allows us to do single page app while
going to a separate jsp and back when needed)
* features to help us make authoring easier. The door is still pretty open
on this on.

The rest of the features we need (ajax support, promises, etc.) are pretty
ubiquitous.

So ...
1) If you get this, let me know the list (and my subscription) is working
2) If you're interested in contributing (to architecture, design, code,
testing, whatever as it relates to UI), let me know that as well.

Cheers,
Jason

Message-ID: <CAJREbOUY=ha_AW5GJUX__ELTmgL=aghkN2iuiKb02SUL05q3Bw@mail.gmail.com>

*Help needed website/CSS*

We are in the process of revamping the WebGoat website pages to show some
of the features of the new WebGoat and to add more directed application
security content.  Jeff Wayman would like some help with the WebSite design
and css magic.  Are there any volunteers that can help him out.  Please
contact Jeff directly at jwayman -at- sonatype -dot- com.


If you were bcc'd on this list, please subscripe to the webgoat mailing
list if you are not already subscribed

*A little goat status....*

The plugin architecture is moving forward slowly.  Nanne has made some
significant progress with the old lesson -> to old lesson plugin
framework.  Rick/Jason/Dave are still working on the more dynamic new
lesson (and labs) plugin architecture.  We should be having a working demo
of the old lesson plugin and the simplified WebGoat lesson container on
todays catchup call for those of you on the invite.

*Help needed WebGoat UI work*
