Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Getting an error trying to do CVS sync
Message-ID: <EIEPLKCCILDFOCKMNFLKAEBNCAAA.abrahamkang@earthlink.net>

Hi,

    I was wondering if anyone else was getting this error:

cvs checkout -P webgoat (in directory D:\cvsLocalRoot)
? webgoat/build
cvs server: Updating webgoat
cvs server: failed to create lock directory for `/cvsroot/owasp/webgoat'
(/cvsroot/owasp/webgoat/#cvs.lock): Permission denied
cvs server: failed to obtain dir lock in repository `/cvsroot/owasp/webgoat'
cvs [server aborted]: read lock failed - giving up

***** CVS exited normally with code 1 *****

I also noticed that all files had ^M at the end of each line.

Does anyone know how I can fix these two problems.

Thanks,
Abraham

I'm getting this as well. I reported this to Ray some time ago, but couldn't
move forward. Ray suggested we talk to the SF folks. I think that's the best
bet

No, ssh using my ajv account at sourceforge. This is via both Tortoise CVS
and via the normal CVS client under NetBSD.

Are you using *anonymous* pserver ?

Thanks Mark and Andrew,

   I just logged in as anonymous, deleted the existing directory, and it
worked.

Regards,
Abraham

I am pretty sure that unless you are added to the OWASP CVS ACL's privs, it
tries to get a lock and you will get an error.

Try anon pserver for check out. Or better still pull the jar from the dist
through web cvs.
