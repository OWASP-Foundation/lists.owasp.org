<PRE>Hello,

I am currently using the version 5.2 of OWASP WebGoat.
I am particularly interested in AJAX security and one major XSS threat
is the DOM-based one. However, I wanted to discuss the way the scenario
is presented in the lesson AJAX Security/LAB: DOM-based cross-site scripting&quot;

First, because I do not understand the point of this lesson in the way
it is explained. It remains unclear how such an attack could occur given the
initial parsing of the webserver (removes every &lt;,&gt;,&quot; characters and some others).
Usually, DOM-based XSS is particularly prone to be triggered by a fished victim.
In this lesson, however, it seems that one should input already the JavaScript code
within the browser.

Second, because of that unclear scenario, a beginner may not be able to grab the idea
of DOM-based XSS.

Maybe, I am wrong somewhere but I was unable to provide the JavaScript payload without
specific characters (such as &lt;,&gt;) and was not able to inject it on the browser, preventing
the server side from seeing it, on top of that without the victim doing a thing.

I tried submitting a link which would get parsed by the server removing specific characters.
I tried embedding it in an iframe and consequently inject it using JavaScript which does
not work since my crafted webpage was not allowed to grab the iframe contents.

I may miss some skills. Can anyone show me a way to conduct such an attack on the WebGoat
server in order to illustrate the DOM-based XSS attack since even the yehg.net solution video
is merely copy/pasting the payload in the input field (sounds a high level of social engineering
for subverting the user into inputting such an obvious payload...).

Regards,

Gregory BLANC.
