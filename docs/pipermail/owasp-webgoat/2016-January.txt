Sorry I haven't been able to dig into this yet (holidays etc., now
catching up at work, but hope to spin some WebGoat cycles this week).
Can you tell me specifically which lesson it happens in (as there is
more than one XSS lesson)? I've specifically tried to have it not 'fix'
anything through the general UI functions, but just as there are hidden
vulnerabilities, there may be hidden 'fixes' going on (one reason I
moved to Backbone from Angular).

The remote access (localhost vs a 'truly remote') server should not
matter). Have you tried running via the self-executable or the tomcat7
plugin (from source in the latter case)?

Cheers,
Jason

Just checking in Diana ...

To reference the issues/fix I was citing, here is an example:
https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/issues/141

Maybe try pulling a fresh copy of WebGoat and let me know if you still
experience the issue. If so, let me know how/when/where you are seeing the
modified value. jQuery itself shouldn't be doing any escaping or munging,
but there are lots of moving parts. Any detail/update you can provide is
appreciated. Even better if you can do so via github (but I'm happy to
translate to github as well).

If I don't hear back, we will continue with our own testing and assume this
OBE.

Cheers,
Jason

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Lesson Review for WebGoat 7 release
Message-ID: <569EF0C3.1090309@owasp.org>

Bruce/Nanne/Doug,

(cc'ing the list on this as more eyes wouldn't hurt) ...

I updated a few issues/lessons (session fixation, stored xss to name
two) and updated the comment 'master' issue at -
https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/issues/142.

The only yes-required-for-release and no-does-not-work is 'Injection
Flaws / XPath Injection' and has a note/issue of:
'lessons/XPATHInjection/EmployeesData.xml missing error'. Seems like a
missing file or incorrect path maybe ... haven't dug into it yet myself.

I am done for tonight, but wanted to throw out that update.

Cheers,
Jason
