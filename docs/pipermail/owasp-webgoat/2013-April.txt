Hi All,


I have been a pentester all these years and now putting my hands on to code reviews and secure coding.

I have decent knowledge in Java/JEE. As a first step towrads learning secure coding & secure code reviews, I downloaded the webgoat and looked into the source code.

As of now, I am not using any tools (commercial/Open source) and doing the code review by doing a manual code crawl.

Once I find the vulnerabilities in code, I use the OWASP cheatsheet to fix it.

How I find the vulnerabilities is by just doing a find on vulnerable classes, keywords which are not advised to be used according to best practices (eg: Statement instead of prepared Statement, script tags, etc). Then I look for the fix.?

I am not sure if this procedure is right. Also code reviews are exhaustive. I could find & fix threats for the top threats only.

I want to do it the proper way. Though I am using cheatsheets, which are best, It would be great to get some more help/article/links/book on how to perform secure coding in general (approach and fix for all threats) and also specifically for the webgoat lessons/all threats discussed in webgoat.

Request your inputs/advise in this regard. Thanks in advance :)

Thanks

Twist

For Java, I recommend to read this book, the CERT Oracle Secure Coding
Standard for Java[1]
Yes, to review code, you should understand how to write a better code.

Dear Sir;

Is it possible to solve all the lesson in WebGoat application.
I am working on this application and exploited all the vulnerabilities of
WebGoat.
So please tell me how to solve XSS and SQLI vulnerabilities so that I can
not
exploit these two vulnerabilities.

Hi Ram,

Which are the lessons are you having trouble with? Webgoat has the solution
of all the lessons on the application. You can just check that and see what
are you doing wrong, alright?
