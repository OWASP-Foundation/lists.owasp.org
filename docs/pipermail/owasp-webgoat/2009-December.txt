Hi,

              Can some one throw a light in understanding, how can the OCTET
URL representation gets executed? does it depens on the Client software
(Browser) or the End Server which supports this representation.

<A HREF=&#34http://10.10.10.10&#34>ClickMe</A>

So, &#34 is the OCTET representation of  ' " '.  Just let me know how can I
make this attack successful, I mean what are the Targets for Octet
obfuscation technique.

Thanks in Advance,

Srinivas Naik
