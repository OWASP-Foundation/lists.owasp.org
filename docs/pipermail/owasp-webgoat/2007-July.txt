This is lesson is very straightforward, ie. Answer the two questions
about Basic Auth---"Authorization and some base64 decode". However,
should there be a form presented for me to enter creds to be submitted
and subsequently captured by Webscarab? I am only presented with fields
for the two answers. What am I missing?

What makes you think that WebScarab has anything to do with this lesson? 
Other than using the Transcoder for stage 1?

Message-ID: <46921EAB.9020308@doc.ic.ac.uk>

I'm a relatively new WebGoat user, but I've been quite impressed by both 
the concept of WebGoat and by what I've seen, and I've coded a couple of 
lessons of my own for my own test purposes, related to my area of work 
which is anti-patterns.

Now that I've written the lessons, I can't seem to find the build.xml to 
compile them back into webgoat. At a pinch, javac would probably do the 
job, but I'd rather use the suggested method. Can someone either direct 
me to a copy of the build file, email it to me, or stick it on SVN?

Cheers, Tadhg.

You need to get WebGoat to "reauthenticate" you.  You will type in the
credentials supplied to you on the basic auth lesson page once you've
completed the first stage.  If all your green check marks go away after
you "reauthenticate" then you've succeeded.  Go back to the basic
authentication lesson to see if you get the green check mark for this
lesson.  Remember to switch back to the guest user when you're done.

Easiest way is just to put the lessons into the same hierarchy as the 
rest of the lessons. i.e. org.owasp.webgoat.lessons

The build.xml file is under main/build.xml, but you don't need to make 
any changes to it if you do as I suggested.

Hope this helped.

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Testers requested
Message-ID: <4696ACEF.5090605@dawes.za.net>

Hi folks,

I have been doing quite a bit of hacking on the WebGoat codebase, and I 
would appreciate testers taking it for a spin, and letting me know of 
any problems.

You can check what I have changed at 
http://dawes.za.net/gitweb.cgi?p=rogan/webgoat/webgoat.git;a=shortlog;h=master

You can get a copy of the repo at 
http://dawes.za.net/rogan/webgoat/webgoat-src-current.zip

Just create an eclipse workspace as described in " webgoat/main/HOW TO 
create the WebGoat workspace.txt".

At this stage, I would not advise using the ant build script to 
construct a .war file, as the build script has not been updated to cater 
for the per-user databases yet (see below).

Major changes from the previously published version:

* WebGoat now uses the HSQLDB database engine by default on all 
platforms. It constructs an in-memory database for each user, which is 
discarded when the server is restarted. This may cause problems for 
sites which have large classes all accessing a central webgoat server. 
Testing and feedback in this area is appreciated.

* Multi-stage lessons (primarily the labs) have been updated to allow 
direct access to each stage, even if the previous stages have not yet 
been completed.

* New Oracle-based lessons have been added, to demonstrate SQL Injection 
inside stored procedures, as well as data validation (Cross Site 
Scripting lesson). These lessons obviously depend on WebGoat being 
backed by an Oracle database. To experiment with this, edit web.xml to 
use the oracle database driver (oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver), update your 
connection string, and add DatabaseUser and DatabasePassword attributes. 
Also see WEB-INF/webgoat_oracle.sql. Note that the DatabaseUser 
parameter is actually a prefix. The user that webgoat will attempt to 
log in as will be ${DatabaseUser} + "_" + ${user}. e.g. webgoat_guest

Other changes were basically major clean ups and refactorings, which 
should not affect how WebGoat works. Any regressions will be eliminated 
on receipt of a bug report.

Happy testing!

Regards,

Rogan

Message-ID: <46A10095.3040809@comcast.net>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Trying to make WebGoat 5 HTTP splitting work gave me loads of trouble.
I got as far as using the hints, injecting the answer they flat out gave
me into the outgoing request, the HTTP header in the second request, and
the form itself, and it didn't help.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, or maybe
it's busted.

WebGoat 5 also breaks horridly on Windows if you drop the WAR into
Tomcat 5.5 as anything but Webgoat (again, the HTTP Splitting lesson
doesn't work-- it flat out can't find the JSP file to submit to, because
it tries to go to WebGoat/ instead of WebGoat-5/).  Displaying
parameters and hints doesn't seem to work in that setting, so if you run
WebGoat 3-5 on one server for some reason no go.

WebGoat WAR on RedHat5/CentOS breaks for a different reason:  RedHat
messed up packaging Tomcat.  Point fingers at them.

Looking forward to WebGoat 6.  If you go through an RC cycle with the
Windows and Linux WAR files, I have environments to test both and it's
in my interest to point out bugs.  ;)

Is there a specific point to the client side validation lesson on
WebGoat where you have to break form validation on 7 fields at once?  I
found two ways to do it, one by modifying a server response and one by
modifying my outgoing request; both work independently, the server
response method was my choice because I'm very lazy and it's easier/less
tedious/most obvious method to me (the method with the least work
produces the fewest ways to screw up, and thus becomes better and more
obvious ya?).

 Hi John,

    Thanks for your feedback. HTTP Splitting lesson is very dependant on the
browser and its settings and very subtle details here and there, however, I
agree with you that it needs some improvements to be more robust. I will try
to dedicate some time to do that in the next version of WebGoat. Thanks for
the feedback and keep'em coming :)

Sherif Koussa
