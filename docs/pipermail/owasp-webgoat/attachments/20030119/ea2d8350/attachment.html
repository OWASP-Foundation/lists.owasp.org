Creating&nbsp;the&nbsp;content&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;lesson&nbsp;is&nbsp;fairly&nbsp;simple.&nbsp;There&nbsp;are&nbsp;two&nbsp;main&nbsp;parts:&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1)&nbsp;handling&nbsp;the&nbsp;input&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;user's&nbsp;last&nbsp;request,&nbsp;<br>

<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&amp;gt;&nbsp;ant&nbsp;install<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<br>
This&nbsp;will&nbsp;compile&nbsp;your&nbsp;new&nbsp;lesson&nbsp;and&nbsp;&quot;install&quot;&nbsp;the&nbsp;path&nbsp;into&nbsp;Tomcat.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;only&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;&quot;install&quot;<br>
