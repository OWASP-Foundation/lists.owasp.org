Hiya Bill

Just to clarify on the .NET version.

I just ran the Java conversion tool in VS.NET more out of interest than anything.

I think on reflection and after chatting to Jeff, a .NET C# version would be a great idea but it should prob be started from scratch. When you show source etc you would want to see C# source and you would prob want to highlight the validators etc

I am not sure where we left that conversation to be honest. I think Tim and a few others wanted to get involved but not sure if anyone stepped up to own it..

Cheers

Mark
