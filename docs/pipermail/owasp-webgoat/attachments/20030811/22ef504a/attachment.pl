Hi All

Been to long :-)...Time to get things rolling now, with the new owasp site up, now is a good time to get that momentum running again.

Having spoke to Mark, the project is looking forward to set a few objectives before the end of the year.

First is to get the top ten lessons in published, i understand that Bruce, as ever, is working on this and hopefully for realise in 6 weeks. - Bruce/Jeff please correct me if i am wrong.

Second is the c# conversion,documentation etc i know that tim/andrew/jeff are  working on this. If there are any out there that can help in this project please let me know , Anurag et al can you put in a few hours ??

Third - Update the Webgoat page on the new owasp site

Fourth - get more volunteers involved :-)....

As you can see there will be 2 Webgoat products now

- goat.java
- goat.net

So if you have any spare time or have suggestions on the direction the project is moving, please get involved. 

I have spoken to many of you on list in person, so now is the time you guys can get involved.

Once we get the intial feedback we can start to create/allocate tasks etc, thanks

...just blame it on the Goat......
