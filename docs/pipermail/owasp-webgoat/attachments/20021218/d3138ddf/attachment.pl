Hi All

Finally got the key project streams sorted on sourceforge. Those with tasks allocated will have probably have noticed this by now :-)....

With Christmas coming up etc...think key thing for V1 release is to ensure that the orginal beta version is finalized in a stable format. Then next year we can put together the bells and whistles with extra lessons etc 
:-)...

In summary we have the following tasks assigned

Finishing the installer on Windows platform - Bruce - End date 23/12/02
Finishing the installer on linux platform - Maureen - End Date - 23/12/02
Finalizing the Cheat sheet information - Bruce/Maureen/Apurv 30/12/02
Add User Guide to Home Page / Install guide - Glyn - End date 29/12/02

If anyone else wants to help out please let us know

thanks
