Hello,
Although I'd followed WebGoat Installation guide, I can't start it.
When I start "startup.bat", it shows me error "out of environment space".
I surely configure HOME variable"j2sdk1.4.2" and aslo installed "j2re",
The only thing I left was "Debugging Step".
The OS I used is Win ME.
Could you give me suggestions?
