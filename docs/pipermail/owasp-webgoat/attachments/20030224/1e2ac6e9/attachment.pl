Hi All

We have had a great amount of feedback from v2 release, so welcome to the new names on the list.

For the next release plan in a month or so, we are looking to code in lesson plans reflecting the top ten list below.

So we are looking volunteers to muck in :-).....

If you want to help please drop us a line with skill sets etc
