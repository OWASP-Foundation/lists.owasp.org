Hi All (G'day..)

Firstly sorry for the delay in this mail, as u may or may not been aware i have been treking for 3 weeks downunder in Aussieland... :-) end of gloating....

Things certainly have been steaming ahead when i have been away and looks like great stuff.

Big hand to Jeff and Bruce, wow what can i say, just installing WebGoat at the mo and by all accounts it rocks. Thanks and i look forward to working closely with you guys.

Mark has brought me up to speed with what has been going on, so upwards and on wards as they say.

I think we have scheduled V2 final for release by end of the year

We have set up a feature request section at Sourceforge, please submit anymore here and  we can collate them for a project plan going forward.

I have listed 3 feature requests(FR) already and tagged them as FR1,FR2,FR3 so it would be easier to collate into the project plan and also easier for users to post comments. 

Thus if you are commenting on (FR1 - Providing a more detailed textual lessons on how to test WebGoatv2) please reply in reference to that tag with ur ideas/comments, ie re FR1 - i think we should do this and that blah blah....

thanx

With Chrimbo coming up :-), Can we look to have final requests and discussions closed off by the 8th December so we can get on for final release by end of December.

Looking long term i am sure that Jeff and Bruce have ideas for v3. Maybe we can start the discussion threads about that as well, what do u say guys ?

Again thanks and i look forward to working with you all

Regards

Bill
