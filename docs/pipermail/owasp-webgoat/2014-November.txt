NOTE: pushing this thread onto the list with this reply (and changing
subject)

Just been trying to catch up on this thread for the last week. Wife was not
feeling well most of the week and I'm well behind the 8-ball.  Going to
have to miss the call today and have done very little done (other than
starting some tests on some client-side routing ideas).

@Rick (and Dave?)
We should schedule a separate phone and/or hangout to get back in [better]
sync. We can coordinate that off-list.

@Dave,
I'm good with the loosey-goosey overlords and don't disagree with the
points you make. Was just relaying Bruce's questions/concerns.

One other quick note .... maybe 'bundle' instead of 'plugin' is a better
way to describe what we're going for here?

Cheers,
Jason
