Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Question regarding WebGoat
Message-ID: <AANLkTimjhXiEV5kvAF-LcLbcRptC1cKFh_yeU4g+Rzrr@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Could you give me any recommendations for a vulnerability scanner that can
be used to generate a report of the vulnerabilities on the webgoat.
I am using the app for a demo for one of our clients here and they would
like me to run a scanner against the app to generate a vulnerability report.
I used nessus app scanner but that could not detect even the most obvious
attacks like stored xss in the app.
I presume this is because of the tool's inability to read the JS in
/WebGoat/attack pages.

Thank you
Aravindan

You could try http://www.websecurify.com/ and
http://www.acunetix.com/cross-site-scripting/scanner.htm (Only XSS )

If you want an example of a web-based UnitTest that replays the
attack/exploits, check out the couple included with the latest version
of the O2 Platform (btw, I could do with some help in writing more
UnitTests :) )

Hi All,

Thanks a lot for the responses. I found  Websecurify quite useful and am
planning to do the proposed demo with this tool.


Thank you,
Aravindan
