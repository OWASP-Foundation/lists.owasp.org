Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Tomcat password question.
Message-ID: <14bba5a61001140856o237c3c47u17d7abe2a4e0a207@mail.gmail.com>

Firstly I would like to thanks all those involved in creating WebGoat.
I have been creating java based web applications for a number of years
and know that amount of effort required to put together something like
this. Thanks.

I am trying to track down the password for the embedded tomcat
installation for 5.3 RC1. tomcat/tomcat doesn't seem to work.

Sean
