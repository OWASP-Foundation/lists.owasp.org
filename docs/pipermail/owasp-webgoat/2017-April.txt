Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Questions about WebGoat - DOMXSS Lab (stage 5)
Message-ID: <D7641E37-6066-41D9-8D42-720FD31FFDFF@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am new to WebGoat (and the security vulnerability field) and have run in to some trouble. For the DOMXSS lab in WebGoat, I am able to complete the first four stages successfully without fail, but when I reach the fifth and final stage, it doesn't appear to work. I copy and paste the text from stage 4 into the appropriate form but when I click the submit button, nothing appears to happen. Maybe I am inputting incorrect information? Or maybe I did something wrong in the previous steps?

I am running WebGoat on an Ubuntu virtual machine via VirtualBox on my Macbook Pro.

I also have one more question pertaining to one of the other lessons. I can't remember which one exactly, but it is the one where I have to use WebScarab to make a button clickable. I have WebScarab installed, but I am not quite sure how I intercept the HTTP request if I cannot click the button in order for a request to be sent? Any help is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Carl Fredrick

	solution
Message-ID: <CABdGKt1Y6pLy75Jaqo1jAwCRKrEqDg+YHj4iyqkwpB9D4RKpqA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

First of all, many thanks for the great Webgoat! It is really a great way
to learn about security.

I have a few questions concerning Webgoat:

- I want to educate a group of novice SE students about security (mainly
the developer sins and also the ways to fix/avoid those sins in Java). I
want them to solve some lessons and then edit the Java code so the
vulnerability won't be there anymore. I believe webgoat 7 is the right
version to go as it is stable, the code is editable when build as developer
and the solutions aren't widely spread on the internet. Am i right or
should I switch to 5.2 or even 8.0?

- Ofcourse I've been trying the lessons beforehand so I can guide the
students with the solutions. I have a question about lesson 6a of SQL
injection in this. It is said a join or union should be used. I wasn't able
to do this unfortunately. I was able to solve the lesson with the following
input:
Smith';select * from user_system_data where '1'= '1

The above query is accepted as a solution, but I would like to know how to
use the solution with a join and union.

- The hints in the SQL injection lessons aren't working. Are the hints not
available/implemented for these lessons or am I doing something wrong?
I'm pressing the hint button and then entering a false input. I see the
error but no hint to guide towards the solution.

Best regards,
Wesly

hello,

tips seem to be tired ;-)

you can try the following to test with UNION

Smith' or '1'=1 union select userid, password, password, password,
password, password, password from user_system_data'
