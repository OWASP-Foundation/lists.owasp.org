Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Blind XXE Solution
Message-ID: <CAJq9cAoQFH7nOk0kv+HfbA=GP7-C6EVwHJBh_Svq7Rmcr-GeiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

I think I have the solution for Page 7 of the XXE Lesson, but the form is
not marking it as solved.

Solution:
Upload a dtd to WebWolf that generates an entity that will send  request to
webwolf/landing?text=<Contents of secret file>

Make a post to http://localhost:8081/WebGoat/xxe/blind from ZAP generating
the new entity and in the text section of the xml comment call the send
entity.

This will make a request to webwolf/landing with the contents of the file.
I have confirmed that the contents match by cat'ing out the file on disk
locally.

When I go to enter the contents in to the form, it says the solution is
incorrect.
My attack is basically the same as the test case here:
https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/blob/f9e552f1cd9f73cb360d3361eb70964c0f5979a5/webgoat-lessons/xxe/src/test/java/org/owasp/webgoat/plugin/BlindSendFileAssignmentTest.java#L72

Any ideas what I could be missing?  I can post the exact XML if desired.

Thanks,

Chris
