<PRE>Hi Mitchell

The project is fairly active and we communicate using email and have a
bi-weekly call and screen share to touch bases with each other.  There is a
core team of about 5-6 people and an extended team of a few more that pop
in and out when life allows them time to contribute.

This mailing list is fairly quiet as most people send email to
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-webgoat">webgoat at owasp.org</A> and that forwards to my work email.  I reply from that
email which is not on the WebGoat mail list so the mail list is very
inactive.

We get a few requests to contribute per month but a small percentage of
those folks actually contribute.  We encourage contributions at any level.

To answer your questions:

Who is currently developing on WebGoat?
  - The about page in WebGoat is fairly accurate.  Nanne and Jason are
probably the most active contributors right now
  -
<A HREF="https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/pages/about.jsp">https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/pages/about.jsp</A>

Since the mailing list is quiet, are there side discussions going on?
  - Yes, I will bring up the topic of using the mailing list again.  A lot
of use our work emails to communicate and don;t wish our work emails to be
in the archive.

What are the current priorities for fixes and improvements?
  - We are finishing the new plugin architecture in the WebGoat and
WebGoat-Lessons Repos
  - We are changing the UI to backbone
  - We are looking for new lessons
  - We have had lots of volunteers to test but no active output from those
efforts
  - We are working on getting better documentation and cleaning up of the
various websites

Is there a schedule in mind for when there might be the next release?
  - As soon as we get the UI working again

Is anyone else using Windows to run and develop WebGoat on?
  - Windows and Mac are the two big dev platforms

Should I just start fixing things, anywhere and all over?  Is anyone
working on certain areas I should hold off touching or coordinate with?
This is the first time I have used Git and worked with a group like this,
all separately located.
  - If you are working in the WebGoat or WebGoat-Lessons repos you may want
to coordinate.  We use jira but right now it is more of a free-for-all as
we get the 6.1 release stable
  - Once you create Pull Request it will get reviewed by the team.  It is
safe to work on any lessons in the WebGoat-Lessons repo.
  - It is better to file a Jira ticket, but not needed

Would someone please reply to this post just so I know someone has seen
it?  Maybe say hello?
  - HELLO :)
