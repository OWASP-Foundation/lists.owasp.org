The OWASP portal will go live May 9th.

If you have contributed to an OWASP project, please go to the CVS module
"portal" and add your details to the contributors.xml file. 

When the user management is turned on you will be able to do this
automatically and add a personal page about yourself, however for this
release its a manual process.

Many thanks.

Mark

Message-ID: <F224FBA669BC42488E34CF105B4DD54D0122E5A8@intramail>

Hi,
 
I am trying to install the Web Goat, and i am having troubles.
 
First I tried in Apache 3.2.4 but tomcat was unable to understand the URL
<http://host:8080/webgoat/attack> http://host:8080/webgoat/attack. I though
was a problem with the tomcat and upgrade to tomcat 4.1.24. I was right
because now it seems Tomcat understand the url, but I obtain a screen with
"invalid session".
 
 I have been working some time ago with tomcat &struts & JSP/servlet
development but for hobby so is not my first knowledge field.
 
Enviroment is 
 
Windows 2000
JDK 1.3.1_02
Tomcat 4.1.24
 
Thanks

Has everyone had an opportunity to look at the various files that we've 
setup in the CVS for content?
