Hey Everyone,

I heard WebGoat can be configured in CTF mode so it doesn't have all the
lessons, hints etc.. is this possible?

OWASP London is hoping to have a red vs. blue team where the blue team
tries to fix webgoat issues, while the red team tries to automate attacks
for every known issue.

We will score the different blue team instances and we'll score followed
 the red team scripts against the base version of webgoat.

Can it work in this setting?

This sounds interesting.

We could add a feature to make all lessons like the challenge. That
shouldn't be hard. Let me know if this is a priority. I would also
recommend using a newer branch of WebGoat as it uses modern technology and
would be more realistic to a real world app.

The lesson omission can be configured by modifying webgoat.properties
