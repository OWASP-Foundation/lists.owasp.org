Message-ID: <D3F4C99A2DBF9F43BB69B9BAF4BC43EC3DD07D@EXEVS05.its.uncc.edu>

Hello All,
 
I am a graduate student who was foolish enough to choose to write a WebGoat lesson as a class project before first examining the WebGoat source to see how much work would be involved.
 
After going through some lesson source code I have a couple of questions:

1.	Where can I find the data model for the HR system used in some of the lessons? From the source code it looks like the application uses /databases/webgoat.mdb when it runs under Windows, but when I try to open it in Access I only see a user_data table with a single record, and no Three Stooges, John Wayne, or any of the other employee records.
2.	How do lab lessons work? I know that the documentation for this is in progress, but some clues would be nice.

Any information on either of these questions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dennis Clark

Hi Dennis
 
Welcome aboard!  The WebGoat Financials is slightly more complicated than the standard lesson architecture. I would recommend synching to the baseline at http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/ and following the instructions there for building the WebGoat environment.
 
To build a simple lesson follow the instructions in the "New Lessons" category.   There are no instructions on how to build a WebGoat Financials lesson. The basic control flow is:
 
*** WebGoat Financials Control Flow ****
 
Browser ----(HTTP Request)----> Controller (HammerHead.java) ----(Delegates)---->Action Handlers
 
             Each lesson has a main delegate that acts like a Controller for that lesson's actions.  
                     This controller will then delegate to all other actions in the current lesson.
             Action Handlers perform business logic and write data to WebSession
             Action Handlers interact with database (no official data layer)
 
Controller(HammerHead.java) ----(forwards)----> View(main.jsp) ----(HTTP Response)----> Browser
 
The main.jsp servlet is a nested JSP that has a lesson specific content area and will ask each lesson for lesson specific content via the AbstractLesson.java class.
 
I will try to get some pictures in the WebGoat documentation for the 5.0 release.
 
 
*** WebGoat Database ***
 
The data model structure can be found in org.owasp.webgoat.session.CreateDB.java which can be explored after running WebGoat.  After running WebGoat look in <deployed_root>\webapps\WebGoat\database\webgoat.mdb.  If you are running from your Eclipse workspace it will be located in: <Eclipse_workspace_name>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0\webapps\WebGoat\database
 
 
When you're done, I would be glad to add your efforts in the WebGoat baseline or you can register to be a WebGoat developer and work from the WebGoat baseline at http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/   
 
Feel free to contact me with any questions. 
 
 
Bruce

Hi,

Fortify software is using WebGoat to demonstrate the power of their source
code analysis platform.  WebGoat is the 'demo' app that anyone can see.
It's fairly cool and shows some security holes I didn't know were there.
Interestingly, it also misses a bunch of the lessons.  You should check it
out as the web interface is pretty cool.

There's a way to look at the flaws and comment on whether they're right or
not.  The webgoat team has permission to update the pages.  Our login is...

  http://opensource.fortifysoftware.com
  login: webgoat
  passwd: getg0at

Check it out.

Hi list members,
in the near future I've to teach a one week security course and the main
topic would be web application security. Now I think it would be great
to use WebGoat for give the students an overview about it. So I solved
the WebGoat-Lessons for myself for know how to break it. The Problem
I've got now is, that I've solved a few lessons in a way which I think
wasn't the way the lesson was planned for.So my question is: Is there a
"HowTo-Guide" or something like that for WebGoat around?


Attention: I'm not a member of this list so please put me in the Cc: if
you write an answer to the whole list.


PS: Of course at the end it's not important how you break something but
for a course it would be more interesting to show "standard methods".

Regards,
Sven

Hi Sven
 
An official WebGoat solutions sheet doesn't exist.  If you send me your solutions, I'd be glad to look them over.  Perhaps, in the future we can have a section of the user guide for solutions

Hi Bruce,
because I need something like a workbook to remember how the students
should solve their stuff I think that I'll do something like this for
myself. I think that I don't go to do all of the available lessons but
for the ones that I'll put into my course I'll create something like a
teacher-workbook. So when it's finished with the content I'll have in
the course, I'll announce it on this list again but it could be that it
takes about one month or a bit longer because I've much other things to
do at the moment.

PS: The main question is still open, so if someone already have some
kind of workbook etc. please let me know :)

Marry Christmas to all of you.

Regards,
Sven
