     I've looked at the hints. 
    I opened up a windows explorer, and found the file tomcat-users.xml and copied it into the ...Webgoat\tomcat\webapps\webgoat\lesson-plans folder.
I went back to the browser with the files listed. I found the new file listed there and I clicked the view button. It shows up there. 
   I also created a folder in the same ...lesson-plans folder called license. I put a copy of the xml file in it. I went back to the browser and I tried to access the folder which was now showing in the list, and my view was denied.
  So here is my question...I believe, I solved the lesson plan, but I am not getting it marked as solved. So is my solution right or not?

No, your solution is not right. If you have no access on server, then how
you'll copy a file on it ? You must access a file using a bug in a web
system. Intercept a request to server (using Paros Proxy or WebScarab) and
modify it to access a file.
