<PRE>Quick update to the UI contributors.

As you are likely aware, we are reorganizing some repo's. I am relaying
some plumbing (using Backbone as opposed to angular) against the
webgoat-container (working on downstream/forked version currently) repo.
That is what will become the flagship version of core webgoat. I will
likely have to manually move the code over, which wil We will have a lesson
repo as well for those who want to contribute lesson material.

I've had some family-related things come up that have delayed me (aside
from the day-job), but have gotten some traction again. Otherwise, I hope
to get the base code tied to some issues to round it out before too long
(let's say inthe next 2 weeks). If you're itching for something to do
sooner, let me know and we'll try to loop you in earlier.

Cheers,
Jason

&gt;<i> We greatly appreciate your willingness to help out on WebGoat and your
</I>&gt;<i> patience as we are passing through a transition point in getting the
</I>&gt;<i> project moving again.  I think we're ready to forge forward in a little
</I>&gt;<i> more productive fashion now though. So here's the update (and hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> some clarity):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Current release is WebGoat 6.0.1. This was the UI re-do along with some
</I>&gt;<i> general fixes from WebGoat 5.4. We moved to an SPA with Angular and some
</I>&gt;<i> modifications to the back-end/service layer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we've progressed, I believe selecting AngularJS was a little premature
</I>&gt;<i> (and the implementation a little hurried/flawed). While we're still fairly
</I>&gt;<i> early on in the 'modernization' of WebGoat, I plan to move over to backbone
</I>&gt;<i> as the primary js framework in the UI. It supports routing, templating and
</I>&gt;<i> I believe provides the flexibility needed for where WebGoat is going w/o
</I>&gt;<i> extra weight.  A fair amount of code should be re-usable.  If anyone wants
</I>&gt;<i> to have a more detailed discussion, I'm happy to have that. So, for getting
</I>&gt;<i> involved in the UI,
</I>&gt;<i> I have opened up JIRA issues to browsing publicly. If you want an account
</I>&gt;<i> in JIRA (better if you're grabbing issues and working them), let me know
</I>&gt;<i> and I can set you one up.  There are two versions to work on currently, one
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance and one new development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WebGoat 6.0.2 - Current release is 6.0.1 and is tied to the master branch
</I>&gt;<i> in github. You can work issues on that and issue pull requests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WebGoat 6.1 - This aligns to the webgoat-container branch (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/branches">https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/branches</A>). Short version is that the
</I>&gt;<i> lessons will be their own jar files that can be dropped in at runtime and
</I>&gt;<i> are self-contained.  The UI work will really remain in the container.
</I>&gt;<i> Branch web-173 is the first plugin/bundle in this line. This is where I
</I>&gt;<i> plan to do the backbone work. I'm spinning up an epic now with tickets tied
</I>&gt;<i> to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some issues are tagged with both versions, mainly to ensure things get
</I>&gt;<i> fixed/implemented in 6.1 that are also outstanding from 6.0.x.  Moving
</I>&gt;<i> forward, we can separate those out if need be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, feel free to grab an issue and let me know what further questions you
</I>&gt;<i> may have.
</I>&gt;<i>
