Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]Remote Admin Access - Help
Message-ID: <78aa8e80050913181164884c47@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Need help here. Been trying to look for the admin page, but I can't find it. 
I tried using nikto, but I can't seem to make it work. 
I tried ./nikto.pl -h localhost -p 80 -root /WebGoat -id guest:guest -g but 
I can't seem to authenticate. The only clues I have is /WebGoat/exchange, 
/WebGoat/servlet/ServletManager and /WebGoat/servlet/sqlcdsn. Thanks.

Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]About the new stage for "Basic Authentication"
Message-ID: <20050920050639.67349.qmail@web51911.mail.yahoo.com>

With regards to the new stage in basic auth, I was
able to reauthenticate as the user "basic", and pass
the stage within the "basic" account. However logging
back into my "guest" account, it still thinks I havent
passed the stage. Is it possible to pass within the
"guest" account as when you reauthenticate the code
being executed is under the "basic" account, hence it
isnt possibile for makeSuccess() to ever get called
for the "guest" account.

After you force the browser to reauthenticate you, the page request is 
issued by the browser to the client.  Notice that the old session id is 
passed with the new request.  Why did this happen?  Think about the how and 
when cookies are sent to the server and the order of events that occur on 
the server side to ensure the client is authenticated.   Are you SURE you 
were authenticated as "basic"? Perhaps your authorization token was 
basic:basic but you are still authenticated as "guest" :)


Bruce.

Message-ID: <051377E9AE5FB246941CCFDBDF7B425CB022EE@merkur.iese.fhg.de>

Hello,

I would like to use WebGoat's admin screen to more easily reset
the application. From what I conclude from the Java source for the
"Remote Admin Access" lesson, the admin screen should be accessible
by http://localhost/WebGoat/attack/admin=true - however, that does
not seem to work in my case. So, where's my mistake?

Thanks for your help,
Holger Peine

Hello All,

I receive many emails from people who use WebGoat to assist them in teaching application security principles.  WebGoat has a lesson plan feature that allows an Instructor to add instructional content to any lesson by simply replacing the LessonName.html file.  If you have created content to assist you in teaching and would like to contribute it back to the community it would be greatly appreciated. 

New lessons are always appreciated as well :)

Hi,

I've just downloaded WebGoat to take a closer look at it. It is 
recommended to use OpenProxy as an intermediate for tampering with 
values but I can't find it.

Anybody know where it is, or if not, what to use instead?

Thanks
Niels

Hi Niels,

I suggest you use WebScarab instead. WebScarab is also an OWASP tool, and is
available from the OWASP Sourceforge download site:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=61823

You can find some usage docs for it at:

http://dawes.za.net/rogan/webscarab/docs/

Have fun!

Rogan

Does anyone know how to reset all of the lessons so that they appear as Not
Completed (N in the Complete column) and all of the other columns in the
table get reset as well? Rather than reinstall WebGoat, I would just like to
reset app so another user can go thru the lessons. Thanks!!

You can:

1) add a new user in <tomcat_root>/conf/tomcat-users.xml to specify a new user.  WebGoat will track all users individually.
2) delete the property files in <tomcat_root>/webapps/WebGoat/users/*.props

If you log into WebGoat as webgoat/webgoat you should see some multi-user admin support in the summary report card.  I believe I turned the multi-user feature on in the WebGoat 3.7 release

Bruce.

Hi Mike,

Looks like you're installing WebGoat war file into a standard Tomcat 
install. If you do this, you'll need to configure server.xml and web.xml 
a bit.  Basically, you'll want to change the port number in server.xml 
to 80 (or just stick with 8080).  WebGoat also has some specific users 
and roles that it uses.  You'll have to configure those into web.xml.

installation
- Add the following users to tomcat-users.xml in tomcat/conf directory
<user username="webgoat" password="webgoat" roles="webgoat_admin"/>
<user username="basic" password="basic" 
roles="webgoat_user,webgoat_basic"/>
<user username="guest" password="guest" roles="webgoat_user"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin,manager"/>

This is all in the readme.txt file in the root directory.

Subject: WebGoat: Problem Logging on


The WAR file seems to expand O.K. during Tomcat start-up, do get this
message though:

INFO: Deploying web application archive WebGoat.war
- Unable to find required classes (javax.activation.DataHandler
and javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart). Attachment support is disabled.

I then browse to http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack (note:
http://localhost/WebGoat/attack didn't work, needed to specify port
too).

I'm presented with the UID/PWD prompt.  I enter "guest" and "guest",
empty logon screen re-displays, again and again.  Finally, get 401
message: This request requires HTTP authentication ().

Need different UID/PASSWORD combination?  Or would missing classes above
have something to do with it?  DataHandler maybe?
