Subject: [OWASP-WEBGOAT]WebGoat 3.7: bug in StoredXss (on Windows at least), bug in build.xml,
 can't solve Predictable Session Identifier, missing lesson plans
Message-ID: <4391B897.6060004@xebia.com>

Hi,

(I am resending this message without the attachments. Forgot I was 
sending it to a list. If you want the files, please let me know.)

First of all, I want to say that I really like WebGoat. I've used it for
two secure coding classes now and it works very well to let people get a
first hand feel for what the OWASP top ten vulnerabilities are about.
The Top Ten itself is good for raising awareness of security issues, but
WebGoat makes it even more visible. Thanks!

I did have a few niggles with it:

1. The StoredXss lesson doesn't work on Windows with the ODBC driver to
connect to the Access database. The code in makeCurrent() wants to
retrieve the MESSAGE_COL column twice and the ODBC driver (or the
OdbcJdbcBridge) can't handle that. I changed the middle bit to only
retrieve the column once (and store it in local variable "messageCol" to
make it work:
===
    TR row2 = new TR( new TD( new B(new StringElement( "Message:" )) ) );
    String messageCol = results.getString( MESSAGE_COL );
    row2.addElement( new TD( new StringElement( messageCol ) ) );
    t.addElement( row2 );
	
    // Edited by Chuck Willis - added display of the user who
    // posted the message, so that if users use a cross site
    // request forgery or XSS to make another user post a
    // message, they can see that the message is attributed
    // to that user
					
    TR row3 = new TR( new TD( new StringElement( "Posted By:" ) ) );
    row3.addElement( new TD( new StringElement(
      results.getString( USER_COL ) ) ) );
    t.addElement( row3 );
					
    ec.addElement( t );
	
    if ( messageCol.toLowerCase().indexOf( "script" ) != -1 )
    {
      makeSuccess( s );
    }
===

2. I couldn't solve the Predictable Session Identifier lesson. I used
WebScarab (nice tool too!) to plot the session identified and although a
weakness seems to be there, I wasn't able to exploit it. Is this lesson
a lot harder than the other ones?

3. There was a typo in DOS_Login.java and it had no lesson plan. I fixed
the typo and wrote a lesson plan. Where can I submit these changes?

4. The web services lessons also had no lesson plan: Soap Request, WSDL
Scanning, and Web Service SQL Injection.

5. The build.xml did not have a "dist" target, but a "dist_CBT" target.
That target seemed to want to invoke the macro's <CopyWebCBTToBuild/>
and <WarBuild/> but they hadn't been defined. I changed that to invoke
the targets -WebXMLWindows, -CopyWebCBTToBuild and -WarBuild. The first
was done to make sure the web-windows.xml was copied to web.xml, because
that step would otherwise be skipped:
   <target name="dist_CBT" depends="clean, compile"
       description="Create CBT binary distribution">
     <antcall target="-WebXMLWindows" />
     <antcall target="-CopyWebCBTToBuild" />
     <antcall target="-WarBuild" />
   </target>

Well, I hope these remarks are helpful. If you have any more questions,
please let me know.

Thanks for a great tool!

Regards, Vincent Partington.

Well, it may be a bit harder than some of the others, but it is a fairly 
advanced topic.

The idea is that you should look at the pattern that the generated 
WEAKID's follows. The key thing to notice is that there is a sequential 
component, and a time-based component.

The sequential component simply increments by one for each WEAKID 
generated. Periodically, you will see that the WEAKID skips an increment 
(i.e. increases by 2). The idea is that "someone else" has requested a 
session at the same time, and so you can see exactly what the sequence 
number for that WEAKID is (since you have the WEAKID's on either side!)

The objective of the lesson is to brute force the time-based component 
of the WEAKID, and gain access to the actual session that the other 
"user" received. You can identify a successful compromise by the fact 
that you will not be prompted to logon.

To assist you in brute forcing the time-based component, there is a 
pre-written script distributed with WebScarab in the scripts directory, 
which does the necessary prompting.

Take a loot at the script, try it out, and see if you get any results.

Once you have identified the actual WEAKID, you can add it to the 
"Shared Cookies" in WebScarab, and (under the Proxy -> Miscellaneous 
tab) enable "Inject known cookies in requests", which will enable you to 
view the session in your browser (if you reload the page). This is a 
generic technique for hijacking sessions, if you would like to access 
them using the browser, rather than hacking them manually ;-)

Lesson PlanHi Vincent

1) Has been fixed.  I have a patch release for OWASP but I haven't delivered it yet.  

2) Rogan addressed in separate e-mail

3) Thanks - I'll add to the patch release

4) Working on that.

5) I'll look into that and add that to my patch release.

Thanks for the comments!

Hi everyone!

I've installed WebGoat 3.7 under Linux, and found a
problem when doing the test "How to perform Blind SQL
Injection".

The screen WebGoat presents to me always says "An
error ocurred, please try again", which is given when
an SQL Exception has been thrown.

The log file has several entry like the following one:

http-80-Processor25 SELECT TOP 1 first_name FROM
user_data WHERE userid = 15613
Don't understand SQL after: "SELECT"
Expected: "INTO" found: "first_name"

If anyone could give me a hint on how to solve the
problem,
I would greatly appreciate it! 

Greetings,

David Echarri

Hi,

I installed Webgoat and was able to run it. However, I am only able to access the first lesson. 

when I attemp to access the other lessons, I am still presented with the page of the first lesson.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks.

This is most likely a problem with the enhydra DB we use for Linux.  I'll 
try to get the fix for this in the patch release which should be released 
soon.  Unfortunately, this one is a bug.

Yes, that was my fault.  When I wrote that lesson I thought WebGoat
was no longer supported on non-Windows systems.  I'll update the
lesson to work on both systems.  The line you mentioned needs to be
changed, but all the hints are assuming you are using the MS Access
back end, too, so they need to be updated.

Thanks Chuck.

I have attached the latest source for this file.  Hopefully, it will compile 
with the rest of the 3.7 source.  If not,  let me know and I'll update CVS 
with the latest stuff.

I have updated the lesson and it works now, but I can't figure out how
to solve it to write up the hints.  I hope the issues are just that I
don't have the proper SQL syntax and not limitations of the database. 
I've looked around on Google and I can't figure out the issues below. 
If someone has any ideas or a good reference for the InstantDB, please
let me know.  The documentation at
http://www.instantdb.com/doc/index.html does not seem to cover these
issues.

1.  Nested SELECTs don't want to run.  On the String SQL lesson, for
example, if I inject this:

Smith' AND ((LENGTH("test")) < 100)

It works, but if I inject this:

Smith' AND ((LENGTH(SELECT first_name FROM user_data WHERE userid=15613)) < 100)

I get a syntax error.  I have tried all sorts of variations here to
get the select to run, but no luck.

2.  I can't figure out how to convert from a character to a number
(its ASCII value).  If I try to inject this:

Smith' AND ((SUBSTR("test", 1, 1)) < 77)

I get an error about "Illegal mixture of string/numeric."

Thanks in advance for any help.

Chuck

To all the OWASP participants worldwide,

 

 As 2005 comes to an end I want thank you all for making OWASP a success!
With a growing membership and skyrocketing downloads we are making a real
difference in finding and fighting the causes of application security
vulnerabilities.

 

Through your hard work in 2005, OWASP has released a completely overhauled
Guide, powerful new features in WebScarab, and hosted two successful AppSec
conferences. Our downloads have more than doubled to over 16,000 every
month, our unique visitors have doubled to almost 35,000 every month, and
our bandwidth requirements have soared 600% to over 18GB per month.

 

Our New Jersey chapter has arranged for a Holiday discount for OWASP
participants.  From now through December 31st, get 30% off any books you
order through http://www.oreilly.com/buy. Just use Discount Code HOHOHO when
you place your order.

 

Have a wonderful Holiday season and best wishes for the New Year.

 

--Jeff
