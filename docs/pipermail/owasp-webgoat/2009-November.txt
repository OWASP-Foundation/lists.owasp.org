Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Maven build
Message-ID: <76ea681e0911011146y456f09f1o21bb04dedde6be3f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

today i transformed the build process of Webgoat to Maven. There is
still some work to do, but this was the biggest change.
Please make sure that you update your working copy, probably a fresh
checkout would be even better.
A short readme about how to build the project with maven can be found
here: http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/source/browse/trunk/webgoat/README.txt

regards

Christine

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Reg: HTTP HEAD method
Message-ID: <2e482c090911082229v34dd0029se6ca27fc196f9d55@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Team,

 Could you help me out in clarifying this

" using HEAD method in how many ways I can attack an Web Server"

*for ex:* using GET if we request for an existing page, it responses with
200 (Response Code), so if we request the same page with HEAD what is
expected.....

*Please guide me with as many ways as possible excluding HEAD DoS Attacks.

Thanks in Advance

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Webgoat Admin Hack Question
Message-ID: <22f3deec0911151601s37cc1a2bq94387680448dd304@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to figure this out. I have completed both of the other
Admin Fuctions.  But the hints help me much with this one.

Try to access the administrative interface for WebGoat. You may also
try to access the administrative interface for Tomcat. The Tomcat
admin interface can be accessed via a URL (/admin) and will not count
towards the completion of this lesson.
WebGoat has an admin interface. To 'complete' this lesson you must
figure out how to access the administrative interface for WebGoat.

Thanks,

-Mike
