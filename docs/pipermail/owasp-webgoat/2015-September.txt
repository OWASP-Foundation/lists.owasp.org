Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Lab 1, already solved?
Message-ID: <CA+2Ehf=+6x7kTu+XtKv3MP3Rn-aZ-zSZ+esOAhVE7n=nTgMoYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm a student from UIB (Balearic Islands University), in order to
finish my degree I'm making a study about the Security on Web Application,
it means Owasp, and mainly the OWASP top 10.
To make the practice part of the study I decided to use WebGoat, it is
probably one of the best option in order to learn about web security.
The problem is when I downloaded the developers version and making the 1st
Lab (Role Based Access Control) I couldn't delete the user despite doing
exactly what the solution step by step.
I checked the code and I think that it's already solved.

May you check it out in order to test if I'm wrong or the uploaded version
is already solved :S
Besides on WebGoat Owasp wiki there's a comment about this same lab, so I
think it is not only my problem (Maybe yes, I'm just a student trying to
learn)

Thank's for your job!
