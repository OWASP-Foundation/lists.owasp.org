Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Likely not on call today / update

Unlikely to be able to make call. However am making progress still on UI.
Have the menu mostly re-implemented with client-side routing/links, along
with loading the main content. After that, I'll finish up all the helps. I
pulled and saw quite a few lessons have been converted. Kudos on that.

Josh McGrath has gotten back to me and hopefully has pulled from my fork.
Will follow up with him soon.

Have to go back to hooking the submissions with ajax. On that note,
regarding supporting non ECS content, I will send a separate email shortly
to the list.

Related to that and our last call, I'd like to request that any call that
will submit (most typically forms, but some links) for evaluation against
attack.jsp should be classed with 'goat-submit'.  i.e. ...
<form class="goat-submit" ... >
OR
<a class="goat-submit" ...>

Cheers,
Jason

Short version to get the discussion started ...

Options I see currently:
1) If we want to enable if via jsp's, we need to accomodate that via the
link generation method (i.e link directly to the jsp and provide
instructions on how to build that JSP).
2) Read/stream content from a 'local' file (html snippet essentially) in
lieu of the ECS code.  This may not be as straightforward as I Imagine it,
not having spent that much time in that region of the code.
3) Some other idea someone has?

Cheers,
Jason
