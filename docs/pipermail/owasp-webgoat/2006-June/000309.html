<PRE>Hello, 

firstly, thanks for this interesting education application. Secondly, I
tried to find some &quot;all in one&quot; documentation (Google, package etc.) and
I've found only few fragments. So did my friends. So I'm sorry if my
comments are little bit off topic because RTFM problem :-). 

Anyway I have a bunch of &quot;little troubles&quot; either with WebGoat itself or
with individual tests. So I will try to make some list:



1) At the beginning I just overlooked
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat_Getting_Started">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat_Getting_Started</A> (it's definitely
not the first bullet) and also
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat_User_and_Install_Guide_Table_of_C">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat_User_and_Install_Guide_Table_of_C</A>
ontents. I can't see because of my eyes :-). 

Finally I type <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/attack">http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/attack</A> and I can see password
prompt. I don't know tomcat-users.xml yet, so I'm guessing few ones -
with admin/admin I can see &quot;HTTP Status 403 - Access to the requested
resource has been denied&quot;. With webgoat/webgoat or guest/guest it is
o.k.  

An interesting &quot;bug&quot; is, when you do the following sequence of URL -
<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat">http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat</A> (with any account) ... code 404,
<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/main.jsp">http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/main.jsp</A> (with 500 - internal error) and
<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/webgoat.jsp">http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat/webgoat.jsp</A> (you are in). (it's &quot;discovered&quot;
just by chance, because I firstly overlooked getting started.)  I think
that just <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat">http://127.0.0.1/WebGoat</A> is more obvious and the
&quot;getting_started&quot; should be more visible. 


2) Documentation says &quot;application running on default port 8080&quot; - but
in fact it's just 80. I'm speaking about windows WebGoat 4.0 release run
and play release, not the UNIX one.

3) general tests - little troubles with &quot;timing&quot;, but the java source
says 1500 thread sleep - in this moment it's clear :-)

4) unvalidated parameters - everything clear 

5) remote admin access - I have some clues, but still didn't finished
:<i>-) (i'm a lame :-)
</I>
6) LAB - role based access control - little bit of playing with password
(obvious &quot;name&quot;, but focus is on defeating RBAC, not trying to guess
what's the password - it could be written there), I can delete any
account. I'm moved to 2nd and 3rd stage, test is not finished and I
probably don't understand the task &quot; Implement access control in the
Businesses Layer to verify authorization to use the Delete function
before actually executing it.&quot; I should change the source to improve
this function?

7) path based - everything clear

8) access control matrix - clear

9) forgotten password - clear

10) authentication cookie - clear (and nice :-)

11) how to hijack the session - mechanism is clear, webscarab sessionID
analysis works well, incrementation of one part and timestamp of the
second part of the weak cookie is obvious, but I have to improve the
final technique - I'm little bit lame :-)

12) basic authentication - very easy, but there is a little mistake in
the second field - even I'm using basic:basic or my custom id, required
answer is webgoat:webgoat, which doesn't correspond with actual id (e.g.
YnVyZ2hpOmJ1cmdoaQ== is burghi:burghi, but I can see &quot;* Basic
Authentication header value is incorrect.&quot;. 

There is another error - the second stage wants me to reautenticate as
basic basic. But I'm logged as burghi:burghi or later I changed it to
basic:basic or webgoat:webgoat. But the application still
reports:&quot;You're almost there! You've modified the Authorization header
but you are still logged in as burghi.&quot;. But I'm in this moment
webgoab:webgoat, as is clear from headers &quot;Authorization: Basic
d2ViZ29hdDp3ZWJnb2F0 
Cookie: JSESSIONID=4B40F9585857E8CBFE52996C8521842E&quot;. 

I finished this task at the end, but I don't have a score in &quot;burghi&quot;
account, only for webgoat account. 

13) XSS jumped over (I will play with it later)

14) buffer overflow - I just clicked on it and I saw congratulations
...? Probably the magic is in &quot; This lesson needs a creator.&quot; 

15) command injection - clear

16) parameter injection - same as buffer overflow



to be continued - sorry, it's little bit longer, so I will try to
continue later. I guess that some of my failures are just my lack of
skills, but some of them I hope are really errors. I will try to find
some time to help to fulfill some articles in wikipedia. 

best regards

Kamil Golombek
