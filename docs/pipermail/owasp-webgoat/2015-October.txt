Maybe not what you have intended Jerry, but I ported webgoat.net to microsoft ASP.NET, in case anyone is interested, let me know, I didn't want to push a patch as I like it to be mono based, but it is there fore anyone that might want it.
I am unsure if we can have a version that works on both envirionments
