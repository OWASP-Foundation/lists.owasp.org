Hello!

I have Tomcat 5.5 up and running on Linux, but [guest/guest] doesn't work as
the username and password for WebGoat.  Does anybody have an idea what I
did?

Thanks!
Chris

Hi,
Try to look up file named "tomcat-users.xml" to see if there is a line
containing guest/guest.

Good luck

Bo

Updates: I found that the WAR's name isn't supposed to contain the version
numbers, and that will be included on the wiki shortly.  I fixed that and
restarted, and saw no improvement.

Then I found that the current catalina log was changing when I ran
shutdown.sh to restart, saying that Tomcat wasn't stopping (and thus not
actually restarting).  This too turned out to be a false positive:
http://www.myeclipseide.com/PNphpBB2-printview-t-10622-start-0.html

Now for your suggestion, li bo.  It didn't solve the problem, but I still
truly appreciate it.  Each suggestion that's not a solution gets me closer
to the one that is.

I first set the role of guest/guest to "guest," but that was apparently
invalid and gave me the below error.  Then I changed the role (and its
declaration) to "role1," which was suggested by Google as one originally in
Tomcat, and WebGoat no longer asked for my password; it just went straight
to a 403 "Access to the requested resource has been denied."  When I deleted
the role and user, and restarted Tomcat, I got the old 401 "This request
requires HTTP authentication" when refusing to give a password.  The same
thing happened for my admin account when I tried it, so I think the solution
lies outside of tomcat-users.xml.

Update: I deleted the deployed WAR, stopped the server, installed the ZIP,
and ran webgoat.sh (which is not available in the WAR).  Then I logged in
with guest/guest and it finally ran.  I just updated the wiki accordingly.

Thanks everyone!

Hi,
I am a freelance security consultant here in Pakistan. I have been
involve in this business from young age.
Any ways I can send you my profile If you need it.

I just want to inform you that WEBGOAT is a great project for Web App
PT, however few of the attacks are missing in it.
I would like to develop something for webgoat and add new stages that
help the users to understand some more types of attacks that are in
the industry.

Kindly inform me about the procedure

Thanks

Hi,
As I know there is only one lesson talking about how to make new
lessons in WebGoat. You may have a look of it. Maybe, there should be
more details.

Webgoat uses a Java API called ECS. That's where you should start.
http://jakarta.apache.org/ecs/index.html
Furthermore you should take a look at the source code of the existing modules.
They'll give you a pretty good idea how to structure your work.

WebGoat has several different lesson formats.  The simplest being the single
stage lessons as described in the "How to create a lesson" lesson.  It
really is that simple :)

Once you have a lesson up and running and you are happy with it, let me know
(webgoat at owasp.org) and I'll be happy to work out the rest of the details
with you.

Please feel free to to post questions to the list or send email directly to
me.

Actually, there are two ways of presenting lessons, using ECS and using JSP.

The majority of the lessons are implemented using ECS, but if I recall
correctly, there is a desire to move away from ECS at some point.

There are a bunch of lab exercises which were done using JSP, which you
can also use as examples.

I guess Bruce will chime in here and correct me, since it is his
project, after all :-)

Hi,

I have tried to solve the first stage of the challenge lesson (WebGoat 5.2).
Unfortunately, I have been unsuccessful. I would like to have the solution
of the challenge so that at least I can learn what vulnerabilities are to be
exploited.

Thank you very much.

Message-ID: <9DF4DCB48693534A986B344B0BF89DDB03A1E42D@ligament.Ounce.local>

Here are some basic hints for the Challenge:

Stage 1:
Steal the source:  Using the URL presented by other lessons to view the
source code, issue this same request when the challenge screen is
loaded.  (presentation layer access control bypass, just because the
"show java" button is missing on the challenge doesn't mean the
functionality is protected)

Stage 2:
Steal the credits cards:  use SQL injection, look at all possible
sources of input

Stage 3:
Deface the site:  Command Injection.  The trick here is to "find" the
location of the main webpage.  Through the hints (once you get command
injection working) WebGoat will tell you the name of the file to
overwrite.  It's usually something like webgoat_challenge_guest.jsp.
However, depending on your installation, the file can reside in
different places.  I use command injection with the DOS FIND or FINDSTR
command (with some options to recursive search) to locate the path to
this file.
Then I craft another command to overwrite that file.  Pay attention to
the quoting on the attack string.
