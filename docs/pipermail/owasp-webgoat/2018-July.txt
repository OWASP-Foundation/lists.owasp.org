No it is not a real release, think we started out with tagging as 8.0.0 not
sure anymore, we now use the tags like v8.0.0.M21 etc.

It is stable and almost final at least for 8.0 (we will keep on adding more
lessons in future releases)
Think we will create a release 8.0.0.RELEASE in the near future (one month
max)

Indeed for 8.0.0.RELEASE just some bug fixes/cleanup. For 8.1.0 we will add
new lessons.

Kind regards,
