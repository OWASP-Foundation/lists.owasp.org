Hi All,

I was using WebGoat v5.1 (Injection Flaws: Blind SQL Injection) and
noticed that my old solution, the solution provided in the hints
section of the lesson, as well  the lesson solution ("Show Solution")
documentation is incorrect.  Is WebGoat v5.1 - Blind SQL Injection
lesson broken? Perhaps the user database has been updated?


   Cheers,
      Serg

The default database on Windows has been changed from Access to HSQLDB 
(which was always the default on other platforms). That may have had an 
effect on the lesson. If it did, though, the lesson would always have 
been broken on those other platforms, so it is probably a good thing 
that this has been discovered . . .

Actually, it worked with previous version on XP

Yes, that is because previous versions used Access, rather than HSQLDB. 
5.1 now uses HSQLDB on all platforms, including Windows. It seems to me 
that this is the most likely candidate to be responsible for the breakage.

If this is the case, it suggests to me that this lesson never worked on 
any of the platforms that used HSQLDB as the default DB backend, such as 
Linux/Unix, OS X, etc.

All of the user names and passwords are matched for most logins.  Larry
has password of Larry (or larry), can't remember which.

No worries. I'm not sure what the problem is, so I'm obviously not sure 
what the fix would be. If I get a chance, I'll take a look at it, though 
I'm not familiar with that lesson.

When thinking about access control, just because the presentation layer
doesn't show the functionality doesn't mean the functionality isn't
there.  Is the business layer performing adequate access control?  What
is the mechanism, and how does it work, that allows the other lessons to
show the Java source?

You can send mail to webgoat at owasp.org if you would like the exact
solution, I would prefer not to post the solution to the list.  I'm sure
it's already out there though...

I personally find this to be a very demoralizing exercise for most 
students. The solution to this exercise is something that very few web 
apps will ever provide you with anyway, and thus most students give up 
on the first stage, and never complete the challenge - unless they have 
assistance/hints from their instructor. That doesn't help those students 
that are working with WebGoat on their own, though.

I'm going to try to think of a different first stage for the challenge. 
Any objections?

Actually, the solution to the first stage is a flaw I find many
applications expose.  They remove functionality from the presentation
layer and don't have the corresponding business layer access control
checks.  The showing of the source code is not the point of the flaw,
the point is the missing access control check.  The first stage of the
challenge is supposed to be challenging and is meant to drive home the
point of access control.  Since these same principles are supplied in
the Labs, perhaps we should beef up the help in the labs to make sure
the access control checks in the different layers are understood upon
completion of the RBAC lab.

I would welcome another challenge lesson but this stage of this
challenge is appropriate.

Andrew,

Excellent points.    We can move the stages around.   

1)	SQL injection - with the red herring hidden field
2)	*New* functional access control - changing the button action
value or something like that.  The only issue I see with this is it
either has to be an "easy to guess" action value or exposed somewhere
else in the application.
3)	Deface the site with command injection
4)	Get the source code via the broken functional access control

Does this work for you?

Bruce

Bruce,

I find the relative strengths of the stages of the Challenge to be a  
challenge to my students. Some of the later stages are far easier than  
the first stage. They often take > 15 minutes to discover the  
mechanism, and in most cases do not find it. The recent addition of  
adding the URL arguments made it even harder than before.

Although I agree that we must have a faulty access control mechanism  
in the challenge (it's my favorite!), but it should work up in hardness:

Stage 1: Easy, no more than a couple of minutes
Stage 2: Moderate: no more than five-ten minutes to work through
Stage 3: Moderately hard: no more than ten minutes
Stage 4: Hard - this is where the faulty authz mechanism should be

Currently, Stage 1 requires them to synthesize a new attack based upon  
first principles and to inspect their WebScarab traces carefully.

We haven't shown them anything like Stage 1 before. There's a lot of  
"what might be missing..." scenarios in the other sections. Can we  
either add a new AuthZ lesson to use this same principle, or can we re- 
order the stages so that they don't get frustrated and stop the  
exercise?

thanks
Andrew

All

 

I've had another university request to build WebGoat Lessons.  I'm
soliciting ideas for lessons.  

 

The basic requirements are that the overall effort should take about 100
working hours.

 

Please send any ideas you may have to webgoat at owasp.org  I need to
respond to them very soon, sorry for the short fuse on this.

 

Bruce

Thanks Arshan.  

 

Another Idea along these lines is using a server side forward to a JSP
protected by environmental access control.  Allow the user (attacker) to
control the contents of the forward and thus bypassing the access
control mechanism.

I think some kind of method tampering lesson would be useful. I'm
picturing the security-constraint has a <http-method> section for some
protected JSP only has POST listed (or GET), and using the other will
allow you access.

Hi Bruce,

Do you have the list of 15 ideas I sent to you on 3/20/2007?  If not I can resend when i'm not on my phone.  

In addition, a file download injection lesson would be easy and better than the current response splitting stuff.

Other ideas...
- forward bypasses access control
- brute forceable authentication
- log injection xss
- sql injection to insert xss (bot)
- bypassing filters with encoding
- double/multiple encoding to tunnel attacks
- using fuzzing to find holes
- timing attacks on auth,crypto
- weak captcha 
- weak flash cookies
- flash xss testing with swfintruder
- dns attacks (harder)
- flash crossdomain.xml (now in Java)

--Jeff
