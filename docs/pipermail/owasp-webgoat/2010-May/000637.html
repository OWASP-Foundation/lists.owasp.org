<PRE>Hi all,

 

I am writing to inform we have found the trainer we were looking for. We
thank all the people that have kindly answered our call. We will keep record
of all volunteers and will contact as soon as we have an opportunity.

 

Many thanks, best regards, 

 

Paulo Coimbra,

Subject: Voluntary/Trainer deliver the Software Assurance Maturity Model
module in the forthcoming OWASP Training Course.

 

Hope you all are well. 

 

We are looking for a trainer to deliver the Software

Assurance Maturity Model module in the forthcoming OWASP Training Course to
be held in London, May, 28th.

As you may know, this event is our first attempt to institutionalize an
OWASP training model.  In conceptual terms, we are proposing a Chapters
driven model with local Chapter organization in which the courses are free
for OWASP members, the contents are OWASP projects focused and the costs are
supported by a mix of funding i.e. local chapter budget, external
sponsorship, trainers sponsorship i.e. trip and/or accommodation paid by
themselves and local chapter members' sponsorship i.e. taking trainers in as
guests.  

 

That being said, if you feel comfortable enough to teach SAMM and have the
will and the spare cycles to give us a hand, please drop me a line.

 

Additionally, in terms of financial framework, for budget reasons we will
give preference to a voluntary/candidate currently living in the United
Kingdom and, in accordance with what is above being said, the OWASP London
Chapter will assume the flight cost and will either find an OWASP Member to
host the chosen voluntary or will pay his accommodation.

 

For now that's all. I thank you for reading this long text. Please do not
hesitate and get back to me if you feel I can clarify anything less clear in
our current invitation.

 

I thank you in advance, best regards,

 

Paulo Coimbra,

OWASP Project Manager &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page</A>&gt;
