Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Invalid Session
Message-ID: <CAL1HEEAMvVqQUaOhZ82eKcT7wpphBin3XtAMvN7A=axsbkQO3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Getting an invalid session when building, deploying and logging in on the
build from WebGoat/WebGoat (new repo). Flushed all cookies and restarted
tomcat, same result.  In the process of trying to merge and continue
developing UI changes on a local/forked version of the previous
WebGoat-container (now primary WebGoat repo).

Anyone else experience the same? In the meantime, going to continue working
in my local version of the previous clone of the container and come back to
this a little later.

Cheers,
Jason

Hi Jason,
Did you add some lesson jar files to the plugin_lessons directory? Otherwise if there is no content to load the following error appears:
SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet [mvc-dispatcher] in context with path [/WebGoat] threw exception [Request processing failed; nested exception is java.lang.NullPointerException] with root causejava.lang.NullPointerException        at org.owasp.webgoat.session.WebSession.returnConnection(WebSession.java:247)        at org.owasp.webgoat.HammerHead.doPost(HammerHead.java:205)        at org.owasp.webgoat.HammerHead.doGet(HammerHead.java:106)        at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:621)        at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:728)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:305)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:210)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationDispatcher.invoke(ApplicationDispatcher.java:749)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationDispatcher.processRequest(ApplicationDispatcher.java:487)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationDispatcher.doForward(ApplicationDispatcher.java:412)        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationDispatcher.forward(ApplicationDispatcher.java:339)        at org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceV
The browser shows: Invalid Session.If you build the WebGoat-Lessons project you can place the jars in the plugins_lessons directory, after restarting the server it should work again.
We should probably show an error message like: "Welcome to WebGoat there are no lessons available please add lesson to directory..."

A little more work (and an old jar built from the earlier versions of
the repos and it's 'working' again here locally, but certainly not ready
for pull. I'll start pushing to my fork as appropriate though.

You're right, we should have some placeholder there ... will think about
that as I work on the other stuff.

Cheers,
Jason

Nanne,

Despite getting it to work earlier, still getting this intermittenly
(and more as the day wears on of course). There's some sequence that
clears it, but I've yet to nail it down ... lots of variables and not my
current main focus (but may have to be).

So, it doesn't seem to be related to the presence of the plugin or not.

It was something aside from the plug-in, but was specific to my system (an
ill-permissioned directory in the chain).  I resolved that part, but caused
myself some system issues fat-fingering the fix.  One step forward ...
