Hi Stephanie,

The installer is trying to download an obsolete version of Tomcat.  

I modified the install.props file that controls where the download 
occurs from.  I replaced  the "comp.0.fileset=" properties line with:
comp.0.fileset=http://ftp.epix.net/apache/jakarta/tomcat-4/v4.1.29/bin/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.29.exe

*NOTE* Webgoat has not been tested with this version of Tomcat.



1) Save the attached file into a directory called "installer".  
    The folder MUST be called "installer".  

2) Open the "install_WebGoat-2.0_windows.jar" using WinZip.  
    Drag the installer folder ( which contains install.props ) and 
    drop it on the WinZip window.  This will cause the install.props 
    file to be added into the "install_WebGoat-2.0_windows.jar" 
    file with a path of installer.  

3) Make sure you only have ONE install.props file in the .jar file. 
     If you have more than one install.props file, the file was not added properly.

4) Double click on the "install_WebGoat-2.0_windows.jar" file 
    and everything should work fine.

If doesn't work let me know.  I can build a new installer and send it to
you.  

Bruce.

I'm tryng to install WebGoat 2.0, installer stops when it tries to 
download Tomcat: when asked if a proxy server is in use I answer "Yes", 
but then it gets stuck and nothing happens. Is installer going to work 
with a proxy server or do I need to bypass it?

Thanks

Hey guys, this is my first post to the group.  I have been getting familiar
with WebGoat and am about to play with the challenges, but I wanted to make
sure I'm on the right track before I continue.  Thanks!

TOOLS USED:
PenProxy (HTTP Proxy that allows modification of many fields)
Achilles (Another HTTP Proxy that was suggested)
HTTrack (Tool for spidering websites)
FormScalpel (Form manipulation and more)

WALK-THRU?!?:

HTTP BASICS:  I looked at this one for a couple hours before I decided it is
just a 
tutorial on HTTP.  
EXPLOIT: N/A (I may have missed something here)

FAIL OPEN AUTHENTICATION:  This one took forever....the hints led me to
removing the 
password parameter, and "VIEW SOURCE" gave me the author's name "jeff", so I
tried 
jeff with "jeff" first just to see if it worked, and voila, but more
interesting is 
the fact that if you omit the password parameter completely and supply a
valid 
username (in this case, "jeff") it authenticates anyways.
EXPLOIT:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack?Username=jeff
or
http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack?Username=jeff&Password=jeff

HTML CLUES:  This was pretty much a gimme.  
<snip>
    FIXME admin:adminpw
</snip>
EXPLOIT:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack?Username=admin&Password=adminpw
which also yields:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack?Username=jblow&Password=passwd1
that also allows you to log in.

PARAMETER INJECTION:  This one was pretty funny.  It reminded me of the
directory 
traversal/Unicode (ala NIMDA/CR/CR2) exploits.  The &, &&, |, and || can be
used to 
run additional commands that are available in the shell.
EXPLOIT (examples):
http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat/attack?dir=&ipconfig&netstat
or enter the following in the form:
&ipconfig&netstat&ping 127.0.0.1

UNCHECKED EMAIL:  I'm not sure I get this one.  I see that you can send
malicious 
html emails, but didn't find much else.  I used:
EXPLOIT?:
TO:test at test.xom
MESSAGE:<A href="http://www.playboy.com/">http://www.google.com</A> 

SQL INJECTION:  This is a subject I am still pretty new at, but I took a look
at "SQL 
Injection" by Kevin Spett of SPI LABS, which led me to try inserting an
"always true" 
statement (1=1):
EXPLOIT:
Enter an account number:' or 1=1
or
Enter an account number:' or 0=0
:)

THREAD SAFETY:  I used the hints, and saw that if you open the two browsers
(and click fast enough) one users account gets sent to both userids.  Bad
stuff there.  I wouldn't want to see that in production...heheh

WEAK AUTHENTICATION COOKIE:  This one was neat, because it had a little
crypt-o-gram 
type puzzle (jeff/jeff creates the cookie ggfkggfk whereas dave/dave creates
the 
cookie fwbefwbe, they're reversed and incremented by 1 letter).  This didn't
actually 
buy us anything as far as i can tell, except the 'AuthCookie'.  I logged in
with jeff/jeff and upon logging out, I noticed that the cookie had an
'AuthCookie=ggfkggfk' so I put it in the Cookie field of PenProcy and it
worked:
EXPLOIT:
Using PenProxy, I added 'AuthCookie=ggfkggfk;' to the Cookie field
BUT I FOUND THIS TO BE INTERESTING:  I stopped tomcat (java crash) and
reconnected to webgoat, and look what Tomcat threw out...this was actually
kind of funny...

you put the following in the message field and view it, it runs the code.
EXPLOIT:
Message: <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">alert("Put
Malware Here");</script>
(Then click on message to view)

HIDDEN FIELD TAMPERING:  I think I'm missing something here.  I saw that you
can just pass the price parameter as any number you want, so I just modified
the price parameter and got a television for .01, what a bargain!
EXPLOIT:
http://10.40.32.111:8080/WebGoat/attack?Price=.01

WEAK ACCESS CONTROL (SHOULD BE DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL?): All I could find on
this one was that it allowed directory traversal.  Pretty much trial and
error on this one.  Anyone find this another way?
EXPLOIT:
Filename:../
or
Filename:../../
grants access to TOP SECRET stuff.

CHALLENGES:  I am getting ready to work on these.  But I wanted to make sure
I haven't overlooked any obvious stuff in the above exercises.  Thanks for
your input on this, and have a great day!

Hi Jeremy,
 
You seem to got everything covered so far.
 
In response to a couple of your questions:
 
BUT I FOUND THIS TO BE INTERESTING:  I stopped tomcat (java crash) and
reconnected to webgoat, and look what Tomcat threw out...this was actually
kind of funny... 

<snip> 
Successful connection to null 
http8080-Processor4 DROP TABLE user_data 
http8080-Processor4 CREATE TABLE user_data (userid varchar(5) not null
primary key,first_name varcha 


This is done every time that WebGoat starts up, to make sure that you have a
clean database to work from. Obviously this would not happen in any kind of
production system ;-)

WEAK AUTHENTICATION COOKIE:  This one was neat, because it had a little
crypt-o-gram 
type puzzle (jeff/jeff creates the cookie ggfkggfk whereas dave/dave creates
the 
cookie fwbefwbe, they're reversed and incremented by 1 letter).  This didn't
actually 
buy us anything as far as i can tell, except the 'AuthCookie'.  I logged in
with jeff/jeff and upon logging out, I noticed that the cookie had an
'AuthCookie=ggfkggfk' so I put it in the Cookie field of PenProcy and it
worked:

 

The key to this one is that if you start up webgoat, and supply a cookie of
"ggfkggfk", without ever trying to authenticate, you will be recognised as
Jeff, and fwbefwbe will get you access to Dave's account. The cookie IS
authentication, by itself.

 

Good going!

Rogan

P.S. to the WebGoat folks, perhaps you might want to mention WebScarab as a
tool that folks can use in their investigations of WebGoat?

WEAK ACCESS CONTROL (SHOULD BE DIRECTORY TRAVERSAL?): All I could find on
this one was that it allowed directory traversal.  Pretty much trial and
error on this one.  Anyone find this another way?

EXPLOIT: 
Filename:../ 
or 
Filename:../../ 
grants access to TOP SECRET stuff. 

CHALLENGES:  I am getting ready to work on these.  But I wanted to make sure
I haven't overlooked any obvious stuff in the above exercises.  Thanks for
your input on this, and have a great day!

-Jeremy

I've found that I can only hijack an existing session using this.  I open
two browsers, login with one, then login with a submitted AuthCookie in the
other.  I use Sleuth from sandsprite.com for that.

Look at the format of cookies and compare to the input criteria.  Get
your junior spy-cap on and see if you spot the pattern...
