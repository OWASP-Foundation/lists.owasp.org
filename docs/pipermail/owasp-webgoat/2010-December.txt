Hi WebGoaters!

In case you haven't heard or met me in other OWASP circumstances I'll
quickly introduce myself. I'm co-leader of OWASP Sweden, chaired this
summer's AppSec in Stockholm, co-organizer of the upcoming Summit, and
member of the Global Conferences Committee. Bla, bla, bla ... let's get to
the point.

I was wondering if there is or has been a totally new WebGoat on the roadmap
ahead? I quickly browsed the 2010 mail archive of this list and checked the
online roadmap (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebGoat_Project_Roadmap)
but could not find such a topic.

Lately I've been hacking on a demo project on my spare time and would like
to know if there's a code base to contribute to or if there is interest in
eventually using my code to kick off a new WebGoat. The demo project is a
J2EE app built with JAX-RS (Jersey), Struts 2, Spring DI, Maven, Jquery or
YUI all setup in an IntelliJ Community Edition project running on Jetty
(HTTP and HTTPS). It is not intended as a hackme-only app but rather hackme,
patchme, and try out cool security features such as HSTS, AntiSamy etc.

This should not be read as if I don't like the current WebGoat. I'm just
curious of how your future plans look.

   Kind regard, John

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] WebGoat 5.3 Developer Version
Message-ID: <AANLkTim-+FvuzV_Z63S4UEQEGrjAxSjBuqX55JYZR_sd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Currently I search for the WebGoat 5.3 developer version, but I don't
find it here
http://webgoat.googlecode.com/files/

Any hint?
Or the developer version is no longer available?

John,

   I have done a little work on some of the WebGoat lessons, but I'm
not in on the future plans for WebGoat.  I do run the OWASP Broken Web
Applications project (www.owaspbwa.org), however, and wanted to put my
two cents in.

   I think that WebGoat is what it is and shouldn't be changed a whole
lot going forward.  If you haven't worked with it, WebGoat uses its
own custom framework and then lessons are written within that
framework.  There may be some places where the framework could have
some minor tweaks and I think that there are also some areas where
lessons could be added / improved and I'm all for that.  I think if
you make significant changes to WebGoat's framework, you are going to
break a lot of lessons and I don't think we want to go through trying
to fix them.

   What you are describing sounds like it could be best as a new OWASP
project that would live alongside WebGoat, at least for a while.
Basically, the new project could concentrate initially on types of
issues that WebGoat doesn't cover (and in some cases can't cover
because of its architecture).  Eventually, the new thing could end up
basically replacing WebGoat if it gets to the point where it covers
the entire range of issues, but I wouldn't try to do that from the
outset.

   One thing the new project would need to decide is if it was
intended to be a "training" application (like WebGoat) where it tells
you what types of issues are on each page, keeps score, etc.  The
other alternative is to create a "realistic" application that will
have vulnerabilities, but not lead you to them (like OWASP VicNum).
Each of these applications types have their usefulness and we have
both types of applications in the OWASPBWA VM.

   Regardless of where your project heads, I'd like to include it in
the OWASPBWA project if you are willing to provide it under an open
source license.

Chuck
