Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Reflected XSS and Safari
Message-ID: <5C60361E-0C74-42FC-8DD4-564FD37C34A5@zhaw.ch>

Dear all

This is not an actual WebGoat issue, but as I haven't found a solution while browsing the web and as it also shows up with WebGoat (I'm using 5.2), I'm posting it to the list. I'm using WebGoat for educational purposes at a university where students use all kinds of browsers, which is where we stumbled across the issue.

It's simple: Use the lesson "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)" -> "Reflected XSS Attack" and insert any javascript code in the "three digit access code" field, e.g. <script>alert("XSS");</script>. We all expect an alert box to pop up. At least for me, this is the case with most browsers (FF, IE, Chrome) but it doesn't work with Safari (latest version 5.0.5 (but it didn't work with older versions either), on both Win7 and Mac).

I have no clue why it doesn't work with Safari. And yes, javascript is enabled, of course. The "Phishing with XSS" lessons behaves similar: inserting the simple script produces the alert box in most browsers but not wth Safari. On the other hand, the lesson "Stored XSS Attacks" (when posting again the same script as the message) woks with Safari.

Can you reproduce the issue? Does anyone have an idea, why Safari behaves differently?

Thanks
Marc
