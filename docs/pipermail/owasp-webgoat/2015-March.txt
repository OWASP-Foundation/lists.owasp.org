Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Repo reorganization
Message-ID: <CAJREbOXHSm-=o-8hPR2JbgLvMpqh+TYrRYLHk6frp2Y-muv4eg@mail.gmail.com>

We have started to move our github repositories to support the plugin
version of WebGoat

WebGoat (the original) is now WebGoat-Legacy

The webgoat-container branch has been moved to WebGoat

The WEB-173 branch has been moved to WebGoat-Lessons

This is going to create some amount of havoc with our website and our
automated builds.  Please bear with us as we straighten this out.

In order to make a tasty omelette you need to break a few eggs, ey?

Keep up the great work!

hi.
So I was trying to use webgoat 6. I went on
https://webgoat.github.io/index.html and download the tar.gz
- extracted it
- "compile" it with "mvn clean package" as instructed in the readme
- cd into target and run
- java -jar WebGoat-Container-6.1.0-war-exec.jar
then go to http://localhost:8080/WebGoat
and try to login either as guest or webgoat and got every time
"Invalid Session" message.

In terminal, I see that execptions are thrown: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10571479/

I don't think it's part of the challenge (?) but a bug. Not very
impressive. Not started and alreay bugging

Moreover, on https://webgoat.github.io/index.html, every link in Links
section are broken (gives 404).
It's the same in
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project, almost
all download link are broken. wtf !

I am using ubuntu 14.10

hi again. So I have just seen the previous thread about the reorganisation.

I am just arriving at the wrong moment.

Sorry.

Nightly build link is working again on https://webgoat.github.io/index.html

Go under Builds/Nightly in the left nav bar
Run with java -jar WebGoat-6.0.1-war-exec.jar

Please be patient while we fix the rest of the links


Thanks,
Rick

Quick update to the UI contributors.

As you are likely aware, we are reorganizing some repo's. I am relaying
some plumbing (using Backbone as opposed to angular) against the
webgoat-container (working on downstream/forked version currently) repo.
That is what will become the flagship version of core webgoat. I will
likely have to manually move the code over, which wil We will have a lesson
repo as well for those who want to contribute lesson material.

I've had some family-related things come up that have delayed me (aside
from the day-job), but have gotten some traction again. Otherwise, I hope
to get the base code tied to some issues to round it out before too long
(let's say inthe next 2 weeks). If you're itching for something to do
sooner, let me know and we'll try to loop you in earlier.

Cheers,
Jason
