Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Modifying docker image to allow external connections
Message-ID: <F87379EF-A97A-4FDD-AFFC-6BA0DEF3F7BA@sennovation.com>

I've read that to allow external connections within webgoat, one needs to change the tomcat conf file. I can't seem to locate that when using the docker image (v7.1). How is the docker image configured to block external connections, and how can I change that?

Thanks!

Paul

Hi Paul,

The Docker container is not setup to block any connection. Are you using
Docker native on the machine or do you use VirtualBox/VMWare for running
Docker? In the latter case you might need to port forward it to your Docker
within the VM setup.

Thanks. I had screwed up a setting on my host. This got me to stop thinking it was a webgoat/tomcat configuration and solved the issue in minutes. Thanks!

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] How to complete exercises that involved editing code
Message-ID: <vlsBFEj0hbWXWMdaYpmOB6Ld5rK0AfwCaBFrrQ3jli4qIwKIWFOVs6Y5S2sDEbhxZ7FxfdrzZyWSbGnCaG5rCK0W_Ukvvr6wGCj8PZ6UeiQ=@protonmail.com>

I've been searching for info for a few hours now and can't find specifics about how one should edit the code in certain challenges. I've run into this for a couple exercises, for here's a specific example: I've found DOMXSS.js (/opt/web_goat/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/plugin_extracted/plugin/DOMXSS/js/DOMXSS.js) for the AJAX XSS exercise, and tried editing it, but that didn't change the live web app source code, even after reloading the .jar file. Also, I found the file in the .jar file in , and updated it, but again, it didn't show up in the web app with my changes.

Sorry, I'm sure this should be obvious, but any help or links to more info would be appreciated.
