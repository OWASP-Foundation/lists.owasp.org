All

It's been a long time...  A new release of WebGoat will occur in late
October.  If you have any items that you would like to see in WebGoat, now
would be the time to send me email or file a WebGoat Google Issue.

If you have any new lessons, documentation, or WebGoat fixes please send
them to me as soon as possible

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] WebGoat Message Board
Message-ID: <4AD2E770.4050400@gmx.ch>

Dear WebGoat developers

Again, the issue with the message board (CSRF) where different users 
should see each others messages.

It worked in older releases:

In 5.0-rc1:
1. Download Unix_WebGoat-5.0-RC1_Release.zip from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/owasp/files/WebGoat/ 
<https://mail.zhwin.ch/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://sourceforge.net/projects/owasp/files/WebGoat/> 

2. unzip to /opt/
3. I add two new users in /opt/WebGoat-5.0-RC1/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
<user username="group-01" password="passwd1" roles="webgoat_user"/>
<user username="group-02" password="passwd2" roles="webgoat_user"/>
4. I do the webgoat.sh modification (Java version fix)
5. I start WebGoat (./webgoat.sh start80) without any errors or warnings
6. I login to http://localhost/WebGoat/attack with group-01/passwd1 and 
press start Button
7. I use another browser and login with group-02/passwd2 and press start 
Button
8. I go to "How to Perform Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)" and post a 
message
9. I change into the first browser and go to the same lesson and I can 
see the message of user group-02

After stopping WebGoat I do exactly the same for WebGoat 5.2:

1. Download WebGoat-OWASP_Standard-5.2.zip from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/owasp/files/WebGoat/ 
<https://mail.zhwin.ch/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://sourceforge.net/projects/owasp/files/WebGoat/> 

2. unzip to /opt/
3. I add two new users in /opt/WebGoat-5.2/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
<user username="group-01" password="passwd1" roles="webgoat_user"/>
<user username="group-02" password="passwd2" roles="webgoat_user"/>
4. I do the webgoat.sh modification (Java version fix)
5. I start WebGoat (./webgoat.sh start80) without any errors or warnings
6. I login into http://localhost/WebGoat/attack with group-01/passwd1 
and press start Button
7. I use another browser and login with group-02/passwd2 and press start 
Button
8. I go to "How to Perform Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)" and post a 
message
9. I change into the first browser and go to the same lesson

But then I can't see the messages from group-01. When I click on show 
Java (CSRF.java) there is a comment
on lines 174-177:

174              // edit by Chuck Willis - Added logic to associate 
similar usernames
175              // The idea is that users chuck-1, chuck-2, etc will 
see each other's messages
176              // but not anyone elses. This allows users to try out 
XSS to grab another user's
177              // cookies, but not get confused by other users scripts

I checked the code but I don't have a clue why it doesn't work (at least 
in the CSRF class).
If you can point me into the right direction I could fix it and submit 
the fix.

The tomcat output looks normal except some errors dropping 
databases/tables after login:

Successful connection to database
Error dropping user database
Error dropping user_login table
Error dropping user admin database
Error dropping product database
Error dropping message database
Error: unable to drop employee table
Error: unable to drop roles
Error: unable to drop auth
Error: unable to drop ownership
Error dropping weather database
Error dropping user database
Error dropping tan database
Success: creating tables.

But I don't thinkt that's the issue. If you need the complete tomcat 
output I can send it to you.

cheers

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Two additional CSRF lessons
Message-ID: <1256310520.5056.9.camel@cam.part.net>

I built two additional lessons for CSRF.  One for by-passing a prompt
(showing why prompts don't work).  The second for by-passing CSRF
tokens when XSS exists.

I also slightly modified the existing CSRF lesson so that the lesson
can be extended and used by the two new lessons.

I tried to attach a patch file but the mailing list didn't like it. If
someone wants to add these to WebGoat that would be great.  Let me know
where I can but the patch file for people to review.

Thanks to everyone for building a great learning tool!

We plan on having the 5.3 release the end of next week. lots to do....

I've been doing the ant build until today.  So I checked out a clean
copy of todays svn and it wouldn't build the package target:

[ERROR] BUILD ERROR
[INFO]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Error assembling WAR: Deployment
descriptor: /home/cam/workspace/cam-webgoat/webgoat/webgoat/target/webgoat-5.3-SNAPSHOT/WEB-INF/web.xml does not exist.

Once I copy the web.xml over to the target manually it seems to build
fine.  I didn't think it was worth a bug in the tracker, but worth an
email.

Hi cam,

i already committed the pom.xml but the project so far isn't maven
ready. The one step left is renaming the packages in a maven
conformant way. I haven't done this yet in svn as i didn't want to
break anyones work shortly before the release. So please continue
using ant for the moment :-)

regards

Christine

     Can anyone guide me in providing some information about how to access
the WebGoat over LAN. I have the setup UP and Running and I want it to be

Please help me as much info as possible.

http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/wiki/FAQ

*Q. How do I get configure
**WebGoat<http://code.google.com/p/webgoat/wiki/WebGoat>to run on an
IP other then localhost?
*

*A.* In the webgoat.bat file, in the root directory, the following lines are
executed:

      delete .\tomcat\conf\server.xml
      copy .\tomcat\conf\server_80.xml .\tomcat\conf\server.xml

This will overwrite any changes you may have made to server.xml file that
addressed this issue....

By changing the server_80.xml file (or by removing the above code from
webgoat.bat, after making your changes) you can reflect your changes to the
Tomcat configuration. You will need to change the IP address in the
server_80.xml file to be the IP of the host machine.

The following connectors should be modified

      <!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 -->
      <Connector address="10.20.20.123" port="80"
      ...
      <!-- Define a SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 -->
      <Connector address="10.20.20.123" port="443"
      ....

where the 127.0.0.1 will be replaced by your IP. In this case 10.20.20.123
