I don't manage to download the WebGoat-2.0unix.war file available on the distribution site as they seem to be html files.
 
Am I missing something ?
Is there an other place where I could find the WebGoat-2.0unix.war file ?

The unix installer is at:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/owasp/install_WebGoat-2.0_unix.jar?download

There does appear to be a problem with the war file link.  You can either extract the war file from the above installer or you get the war file from:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/owasp/webgoat/dist/WebGoat-2.0.war

Hello all,

I'm attempting to get WebGoat running on a Win2k/SP3 box.  I have
successfully installed the SDK (remember to use the SDK, not the RE.
That confused me for a day...) and Tomcat 4.1.24 in their default
directories.  I've copied WebGoat-2.0w2k.war to "C:\Program Files\Apache
Group\Tomcat 4.1\webapps\WebGoat.war".

The next step in the process is to edit tomcat/web.xml and uncomment the
invoker servlet mapping.  I'll assume the tomcat/ directory is
"C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Tomcat 4.1", yet I see no web.xml.  There
is one in tomcat/conf, so I looked for the invoker stuff there.  I did
find them and uncommented out a section that looks like this:

    <!-- The mapping for the invoker servlet -->

    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>invoker</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/servlet/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

I then saved the file, and restarted tomcat (just to be sure), yet I get
"The requested resource (/WebGoat/attack) is not available."

Okay, I have reached the bottom of my shallow pool of tomcat knowledge.
What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance and LARTs cheerfully accepted, 

 - chris

That is JRE or "Java Runtime Environment". The 'SDK' stands for Servlet  
Development Kit (if I remember correctly). Basically, it contains the  
JRE and a whole bunch of classes to run server side java, or servlets.  
The JRE is just the binaries for running the java virtual machine.  
Still confused? Check out  
http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/new2java/ 
programming/learn/unravelingjava.html for more info; this should get  
you started on the plethora of java jargon. Check out the side links  
also.

You need to setup WebGoat as a "context", Tomcat terminology for a web  
app. Go here for an explanation on how Tomcat works:  
http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/index.html. There is an  
"example" context in the server.xml file in the Tomcat conf directory  
(I have only installed on the Solaris and Linux platform; you seem to  
suggest it is in C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Tomcat 4.1\conf). Read  
that file VERY carefully.

I actually have not installed webgoat but might get to it this weekend.  
I do administer a number of Tomcat apps and that is how I learned. DIY  
and all that. If you still are stuck, write back. Also, include the  
contents of the 'catalina.out' file in the "logs" directory of the  
Tomcat install. You will see where the starts begin, so try not to  
include the whole file *grin*.

HTH,

Ben Ricker

Hi Chris,

There is a problem with the WebGoat-2.0w2k.war and WebGoat-2.0unix.war links
on the OWASP page.  If you copied these files to the webapps directory,
WebGoat will NOT work.

I recommend downloading the installer ( install_WebGoat-2.0_windows.jar )
and ONLY choosing the webgoat installation option since tomcat and the J2SE
(SDK) are already installed.  The installer is simple and will copy the
correct files into the correct directories.  Just download and double-click
on the jar file. ( if double-clicking doesn't start the installer, you may
want to verify your java installation )  You will have to specify the tomcat
installation top level directory in the installer.

You can also get the war file by opening the installer jar file up with
winzip and copying the war file to the tomcat/webapps directory.

or... you can download the war file from
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/owasp/webgoat/dist/WebGoat-2.
0.war

Hope this helps, we will eventually get these links straightened out!

bruce

Hello all,

Yesterday, I thought that I had done everything in the manaul to install
and run WebGoat.  It seems that I have, but for one thing.  I stumbled
into the Management section for Tomcat and restarted the app.  I then
went to /WebGoat/attack, well, I'll be, it's working.

Something to add to a FAQ or the archives.
