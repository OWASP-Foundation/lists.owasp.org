I cloned the Unstable 6.1 to my Windows desktop Sunday evening, built the source with Maven, got the jar to run, logged in as guest, and got back "Invalid Session" into Chrome.
 
I ran the webgoat-container-6.1.0-war.exec.jar in \target.
 
The exceptions overflowed my command window, the most recent one I can see is:
 
Aug 02, 2015 6:05:00 PM org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationDispatcher invoke
SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet WebGoat threw exception

        at org.owasp.webgoat.HammerHead.doGet(HammerHead.java:107)
 
In webgoat_main.log I see:

Mitchell,

Here's the run down of what I have been doing (including list in case
others have input).  For background, I develop/test with
a stand-alone tomcat on Linux. Also, our build is a bit of a moving
target right now (which we are working to improve). I'm including the
list in case someone there wants to chime in or can benefit. Also cc'ing
Nanne as he can correct me if I mis-step below.

0) cd into the /webgoat-classloader and mvn clean install
1) mvn clean package << in webgoat 'container'* directory
2) mvn install << I think you can optionally just run 'mvn clean
install' and it should satisfy both steps here, but I often end up
running them discreetly
3) You should now be able to cd into the lessons project and
$ mvn clean package
4) You should be able to copy lesson jars into the webapp ...
.e.g.
$cp xpath-injection/target/xpath-injection-1.0.jar
$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/$WEBGOAT_DIR/plugin_lessons/
5) I find that when running tomcat stand-alone as I do, I have to create
the $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/$WEBGOAT_DIR/plugin_extracted directory
manually anytime I fully redeploy the 'container' application.

* The idea of 'container' and 'core' etc. is going to shuffle a little
(part of the effort to improve build process). There should be an email
coming to the list soon about that.

HTH,
Jason

I overlooked the error message:
 
"Caused by: java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: c:\GitHub\WebGoat\target\.extract\
webapps\WebGoat\plugin_extracted\i18n"
 
The problem is that the plugin_extracted folder was not created, so when it tried to create the \i18n sub-folder, or access the properties file in that sub-folder, it failed.  I start each run with target\ empty.
 
I manually created the plugin-extracted\ folder under WebGoat\, but not the i18n\ folder, and now WebGoat continues after login.
 
Where in the process should the plugin_extracted folder be created, and is this only an issue for Windows?

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Significant Git Repository Changes
Message-ID: <DM3PR12MB0746ABC7A44990413DFF27C7D57F0@DM3PR12MB0746.namprd12.prod.outlook.com>

Hello WebGoaters !

I am very pleased to announce that, after collaborative efforts from  community and amazing work from Nanne Baars, a "repository organization" improvement request that was proposed and approved on the last "Core Contributors" conference call has now been officially committed to Github's Unstable Repository / Master Branch [1] .

The changed implemented consisted into moving the "src" directory one-level down, transforming WebGoat into a multi-level maven project.

This was proposed and implemented in order to support the effort of decoupling the Core / Container / Classloader / Lessons modules of WebGoat, which  will allow easier development and improvement of the different modules of WebGoat independently. Additionally, this will enable us to start publishing WebGoat components to the Maven Central repository, once WebGoat 6.1 reaches a stable point.

The new directory structure is as follows:

WebGoat/
                - webgoat-container
                - webgoat-classloader
                - webgoat-release

For code contributors -> **** You must perform a git pull (or rebase) before you continue working on the source code ****

Running Webgoat:
mvn clean install
                mvn -pl webgoat-container tomcat7:run

Nanne was also kind enough to integrate with the Travis CI [2] service which is available on Github. This will ensure that after a check-in, a build is run, so before a pull request is merged, we could know if the build is stable.

Over the next few weeks, we will be improving the Build Process (and deployable artifact creation), the Wiki Documentation and the Jira Ticketing System ( for sprint planning and defect/enhancement requests tracking).

For those who would like to contribute (with coding, documentation or any other task), please feel free to contact us.
For all those who already contributed to the project, THANK YOU.  Major props to nbaars | misfir3 | mayhew64 | jwayman .

OK, the migration is done (see Doug's earlier email ... and Kudos again
to Nanne). I updated and just made one more pull/merge with the Cookies
Table/view re-enabled. Params, integrating this LessonInfo Service, then
some more menu work and some testing and clean-up.

As to issue management, we have been using JIRA (webgoat.atlassian.net,
will need to create you an account there). I have been very bad at it
myself as I've gotten used to just jumping in and handling most stuff
hands-on.  When I look at the decision between coding and working in
JIRA, I head for the code (for better or worse).  I'm asking the core
group what they think of moving issue management to github (and would be
curious of what new folks signing on think in that regard).

The one item that I can use help with currently that I have not put up
as a ticket yet is to:
Create a (we'll call it for now) LessonInfo Service to return basic info
about the lesson. Some would be redundant now, but could enable more
efficient (lazy) loading in the future. However, there is also a real
need for pulling the lesson title with the client-side routing via
Backbone now.

For starters (and this may be all we need) I'd like to create that
service which returns:

{
  lessonTitle:_TITLE_,
  numberHints:_#_,
  hasSource: T||F,
  hasSolution: T||F,
  hasPlan: T||F
}

Look at the HintService as a starting point

You'll want to fork this:
https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat
... and issue pull requests when you have a change. We can go into
minutia  off-list, but I'm posting this reply on-list as I think there's
some benefit to others.

Cheers,
Jason

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Some updates about project direction and
	Communication
Message-ID: <DF97593B-42F9-4534-863A-5B11F698E54B@corp.io>

Hello WebGoaters,

I would like to provide some information regarding decisions made during the last "Core Contributors" conference call on 08/14/15:
    * Agreed to using TravisCI for our development branch automated builds.
    * Agreed to using Github Issues to track bug/defects and feature requests.
    * Agreed to using version-SNAPSHOT for development builds.
    * Agreed to release next version of WebGoat as version 7.0, given the signifant contribution and changes that happend in the current cycle
    * Agreed to start using Maven Central to push WebGoat artifacts.
    * Defined target date for 7.0 release to be just before OWASP AppSec USA conference. As of know, targeted release date is 09/15/15

Now, we would liketo foster the communication between developers, comunity and users.

OWASP has recently started using the " https://slack.com " service for communication and made a tenant available for our use.

Slack provides an "IRC" style of comunication, with history, search and some other goodies, completely free !

You can request a free invite to access the OWASP SLACK tenant at: http://owasp.herokuapp.com/

Once you get your invite, you will be able to join the conversation at https://owasp.slack.com/ . You can also use a Slack Client or your plain old IRC client.

Several channels are available, but we created a #project-webgoat channel. I look forward to talk to you there !

If you have any pending code changes, please try to create a pull request soon, as we are approaching our target release date.

As always, thank you for all the great work and feedback.

Till next week!
?

Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] WebGoat UI issue status
Message-ID: <55D67831.7090200@owasp.org>

A number of folks have offered to help with the WebGoat UI work.  Moving
issue management to github has simplified things a bit.  I have now put
in a number of issues there:

https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/issues ...
some are labeled with 'help wanted' (may label more that way) and 7.0
release.

I also cleaned up some old/deprecated files (still some more cleaning to
do).

Feel free to jump in and grab an issue.

Cheers,
Jason
