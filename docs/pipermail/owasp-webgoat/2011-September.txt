Subject: [Owasp-webgoat] Authentication problem
Message-ID: <CAGspV83r9MX29fgYi5S=HkQmmFJyMcf1B3PmoqM7WDex20w2ng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I want to prepare a presentation of an XML firewall by using the Web
Services of WebGoat project. But when I want to register the Web Service to
the firewall by using the WSDL URL it gives an authentication error since
the WSDL resides after the authentication mechanism.

Since I am a newbie in XML firewalls and Web Services I want to ask you for
help.

One thing, is it possible to remove the login process of WebGoat so I can
reach the WSDL without any authentication?
Another thing, is WSDLs are always public? Isn't there any WSDL files that
are kept after a login process like in WebGoat project?

Thanks in advance.

Don't know the specifics of WebGoat web services. Can't you just pick the
WSDL file offline, directly from the file system?

WSDL files used to be public in the early days of web services. They people
noticed that they became indexed by search engines and a good start for
whoever wanted to hack your service. Thus the recommendation to not publish
your WSDL.

But aren't WSDLs necessary for calling the web services they specify? Well,
it turned out everybody generated their web service clients statically so
you could just as well send them the WSDL file via email or such. That's not
true for *really* public interfaces such as generic cloud services but if
you're integrating to proprietary systems you don't need online WSDL files.

It's been a few years since I did any serious web service programming. Maybe
runtime generated clients are hot now? A Google search for inurl:wsdl gives
a few WSDL file hits.
