All

I was asked yesterday if WebGoat (the original) planned to participate the
OWASP application process for Google Summer of Code.  This program is for
college students and the deadline is quickly approaching.  The applicant
would have an OWASP mentor, which would probably be me.  You can see more
details at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC2012_Ideas.  If you know a
college student(s) that would be interested let me know.

Please be realistic about your time commitments.  Below is a list of ideas
that I would like to see improved

1) Standardization/expand all  lessons on WebGoat financials presentation
and database
2) Expansion of lesson plan framework to incorporate richer content,
perhaps even tie into other OWASP education projects
3) Enhance the "enterprise" features to make the multi-user portion more
visible and more secure
4) Replace the authentication, entitlements, validation, and encoding
methods with ESAPI

Any other ideas are welcome.
