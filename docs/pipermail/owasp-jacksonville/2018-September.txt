All,
As a reminder the next meeting will be on Sep 10th.  Our guest speakers
will be Mic Whitehorn-Gillam and Nathan Sweeney. They will be discussing
the differences in testing an application and an API.  This will be a
recorded meeting so that members who can not make the meeting will be able
to view it later.  The meeting will be at 3412 Kori Rd, Jacksonville, Fl
32257.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

All,

Our last OWASP Jax meeting was a great success.  Next month we will have
the privilege of Dr Johannes Ullrich as our guest presenter.  Until July
2018, Dr Ullrich was a senior instructor for SANS Institute for training
and taught many courses such as DEV522 Defending Web Applications, SEC503
Intrusion Detection in Depth, and SEC546 IPv6 Security Essentials.

I would like to add that the parking was a little difficult and we share
our parking area with another company. Moving forward, if possible I would
suggest we all park in the vacant building lot adjacent to the Secure Ideas
building. This will reduce the parking confusion and hopefully keep Secure
Ideas out of hot water with the property owner. I have included a diagram
of the recommended parking solution.
