Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] March 2017 Meeting - OWASP KC
Message-ID: <CAD6LLGikuySvdd2m-o6+ZqBLRVgnr6nRXexKDWy55OvKOhUYsQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings, OWASPers!

We've got an OWASP meeting coming up!  (Sorry for the late notice!) .

*Title:  Getting Started in Real-World Hacking*

*Overview:   In this workshop, you will be introduced to bug bounties, a
command-line xss scanner, and the ease of finding cross-site scripting bugs
in websites.*

You will need to bring a laptop!  In order to make things go more smoothly,
it's recommended that you get the following prerequisites set up:

   - A laptop with python2, preferably running Kali or a Kali-VM.  (Any OS
   with a unix shell environment will work, though.)
   - Software:
   - Python (2)
   - git
   - pip
   - xsscrapy
   - **May need additional libraries depending on OS: libxml2, libxslt,
   zlib, libffi, openssl (sometimes libssl-dev)

 To Install on a default VM-image of Kali Rolling

   1. Change to a directory you would like the tool saved in. I use /opt/
   $ cd /opt/
   2. Clone the git repo
   $ git clone https://github.com/DanMcInerney/xsscrapy.git
   3. <https://github.com/DanMcInerney/xsscrapy.git>Jump into the repo and,
   using pip, install the other requirements.
   $ cd xsscrapy
   $ pip install ?r requirements.txt

*Bio:*

      Ryan is the Security Assessments Team Lead at Depth Security.
Interests include XSS, Bug Bounties, CTF?s, and extreme things.


Please RSVP at Eventbrite!

Hi, all!  This came across the OWASP Leaders list, I thought some of you
might be interested in it:

Hi Everyone,



I wanted to share with you exciting news of my newly published book: Essential
Node.js Security <https://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity>.



Its audience is Node.js developers, and equipping them with secure code
methodologies, and common best practices in the Node.js ecosystem.



The book features many of OWASP security risks among the top 10
vulnerabilities and is fluent with practical source code examples, as well
as covering quite a few OWASP resources through-out.



I invite you to get a free copy of the book at
http://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity/c/OWASPIL.

I'll appreciate any feedback, and comments you may have.




On a personal note, I'm actively contributing to OWASP NodeGoat project,
and generally active around open source and Node.js security including my
talk on this topic in our previous OWASP AppSec 2016 conference.



So if anyone would like to connect and share more ideas I'll be happy to
meet you :)

Sincerely, Liran Tal
