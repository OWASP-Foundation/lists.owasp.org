Hello Kansas City OWASP members,

I would like to let everyone know that I will be moving to Florida at the end of the month and will no longer be able to function in the role of Chapter President.  I am happy to announce that Mat Caughron has accepted the responsibility of KC Chapter President. Mat has presented at our chapter meetings before and will be a very capable and dynamic leader. I will be transitioning over to Mat in the next few days and he will be reaching out to the group.

It has been a fantastic experience for me and I hope that we all keep in touch. I am sure I will be meeting some of you at either DEFCON or some other conference. If any of you happen to be in the South Florida area please make sure and let me know.  I can be reached at rohini_sulatycki at yahoo.com.

Best regards,

Hi Rohini,

Good luck on your move to Florida.

I would like this process of choosing the next Chapter President to be
more democratic because I want that position. How do you propose to go
about it? If you don't know - I am not sure either - then I can post
the question on the OWASP Leaders mailing list.

I don't have time now to contribute to an OWASP project and think I
could best serve OWASP in this capacity.

I think I can bring a lot to the table from my past professional
infosec & appsec experience in Asia Pacific, my previous & current
work with OWASP, and my current & future experiences as an AppSec
consultant at Fishnet Security.

What do you think? Can we put it to a vote and how do we do it and who
is eligible?

Best regards,
Stephen

Hi Stephen:

The understanding I have from Rohini is that for the remainder of this
term, I will be acting president to ensure a smooth transition.  This
will enable full process for the coming year.

Among the agenda items are to establish a way to grow up a board -
secretary, treasurer, etc. since this has been a 100% volunteer type
situation by a very small group of people and as we grow the OWASP
community here in Kansas City their roles will become increasingly
more important.  Right now these roles are not filled.  In sum, we can
use all of the help we can get, particularly from companies such as
FishNetSecurity who operate in this competitive space.  Would FishNet
like to sponsor the December OWASP Kansas City meeting?

We have some short term needs that seem as important as leadership,
such as filling speaking slots to maintain a purpose for bi-monthly
meetings.  There is no current speaker for November or December, for
example.

However, this shakes out, your contributions, and those of your
colleagues, will be most welcome.

Please give me a call and we can discuss how best to collaborate,

For those not familiar with the group, OWASP is the Open Web Application
Security Project. The local chapter meets every other month at JCCC and
discusses topics related to web application security. The next meeting
will discuss the Microsoft SDLC, something that should be of interest to
all .NET developers. Since there is limited space where the OWASP
meetings are held, please RSVP with  the local OWASP chapter coordinator
Mat Caughron -- caughron at gmail.com <mailto:caughron at gmail.com> -- so
he's given enough heads-up to more to a larger space if necessary.

Forwarding Jeff Williams' keynote from the AppSec D.C. conference to our
local list below.

Locally, we have a really great meeting lined up.  See you December 10 at
JCCC,


   Mat Caughron
   interim president, Kansas City OWASP Chapter
   (816) 866-0628




*OWASP AppSec DC 2009 Conference*
*Jeff Williams, OWASP Board Chair*
*The OWASP Mission*

First I?d like to introduce the OWASP Board (Tom, Dave, Dinis, Seba, and
myself)
The board runs the OWASP Foundation, the 501c3 nonprofit which provides
support for all the activities that happen at OWASP. Like all the people
involved in OWASP, we volunteer our time to make the project a success. I?d
like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for all the hard work you
do to make OWASP a success.

I?d also like to thank Joe for the thoughtful keynote and for focusing on
the entire software supply chain. His focus on malicious intent is right on
and I?ll be talking about that extensively tomorrow.
If you combine all the materials available through his program and what?s
available at OWASP, we?ve got ALL the right stuff out there. But we are
still losing ground.

For years, we have watched as the software market fails to produce secure
applications.
Increasingly, this situation is worsening and there are two key factors.
First, the reliance that we put on our software infrastructure increases
every day. Application software controls our finances, healthcare
information, legal records, and even our military defenses. Secondly,
application software is growing and interconnecting at an unprecedented
rate. The sheer size and
complexity of our software infrastructure are staggering and present novel
security challenges every day.

While we have made some progress in security over the last decade, our
efforts have been almost completely eclipsed by these factors. The software
market and security experts still struggle to eliminate even simple
well-understood problems. Take cross-site scripting (XSS) for example. In
the last decade, XSS has grown from a curiousity to a problem to an
epidemic. Today, XSS has surpassed the buffer overflow as the most prevalent
security vulnerability of all time. It?s the same for SQL injection. And
CSRF will follow the same pattern too.

These problems, while technically simple, have proven extraordinarily
difficult to eradicate. We can no longer afford to tolerate software that
contains this kind of easily discovered and exploited vulnerabilities. Read
about the RBS WorldPay attack from this week ? the level of coordination and
sophistication required to pull off this attack are stunning.

In addition to risks like this, we are already seriously limiting innovation
in the development of applications that can improve the world.

*Why doesn?t the software market produce secure software?
*It?s possible that the risks we focus on are overblown and that the market
is actually working to produce an optimal level of security in our
applications. But the other possibility is that the software market is
broken. Despite what you might hear in economics class, markets are not
perfect. They have failures like monopolies, price- fixing, and speculative
bubbles.

One classic market problem was detailed in a Nobel Prize winning paper by
George Akerlof called ?The Market for Lemons.? Basically he showed that when
sellers have more information than buyers ? like when you?re selling your
used car that barely runs ? buyers will discount the price they?re willing
to pay. That means people with good cars can?t get a fair price and so they
won?t sell. And that means you can only buy lemons in the used car market.

Now think about that for software. Buyers really can?t tell the difference
between secure software and insecure software. So they?re not willing to pay
more for security.
We need radical innovative ideas to fix the software market. We are not
going to ?hack our way secure? ? it?s going to take a culture change.

The automobile industry made the change over at 30 year period after Ralph
Nader exposed the industry....and today we have cars that have safety
features. The food industry made the change but only after the FDA started
the Nutrition Facts program. Even the cigarette industry has been
dramatically changed through campaigns like the ?Truth...? campaign.
The OWASP mission is to make application security visible. Creating
transparency goes directly to the heart of what is wrong with the software
market and has the potential to actually change the game.
*
Why is OWASP the right approach?*
OWASP is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the
security of application software. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP
and all of our materials are available under a free and open software
license.

In many ways, we?re like public radio. This allows us to reach a very broad
audience and it makes it possible for us to avoid difficult commercial
relationships that influence our activities. This freedom from commercial
pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective
information about application security.

I believe this objectivity is absolutely critical. For too long, much of the
appsec information in the market has come from people selling stuff, and our
message has been lost.

*What is OWASP doing?*
Yesterday, OWASP Leaders from around the world got together to discuss our
progress and set our priorities for 2010. Each of our Global Committees
reviewed their accomplishments and we discussed the agenda for the future.
We just established these committees last year and they are already making
huge progress establishing the foundation we need to achieve our mission.

Before I ask Tom to review our 2010 agenda, I?d like to encourage all of you
to figure out something you can do to change the culture in your team,
company, or industry. In this room are some of the greatest minds in
application security. I challenge you to focus your efforts on those things
that will actually change the world and allow us to fulfill the potential of
what we can achieve with software.
