Message-ID: <CAN4hdVUgpioYr8x0_Om-sLDTrud=Pzx6tojDmEzo2ngBiCQm3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings OWASP-KC:

By consensus, we are going to change up the chapter meeting format, just for
this month.

Instead of having a formal vendor-speaker type presentation, we will be
meeting in a less formal setting to encourage conversation and interaction
among KC's appsec experts.
(We have vendors/speakers lined up again for the monthly meetings from
Sept-December at the regular JCCC location.)

Topic for this meeting is *software tools for application security*.   Come
prepared with a question or an opinion or two about your favorite appsec
tool.

Location this month will be on the Missouri side, in Lee's Summit.

Tuesday   August 30, 2011   6:30 PM

Long's Sawmill Restaurant
3365 SW Fascination Drive
Lee's Summit, MO 64081
    http://ralongs.com/

Food prices are reasonable, typically on Tuesday are $3 beers, see web site
for details.



Mat Caughron,  OWASP Kansas City volunteer chapter leader
