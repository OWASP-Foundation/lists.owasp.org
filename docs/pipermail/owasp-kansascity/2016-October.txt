Hey, everyone!  Happy October!  Happy AppSecUSA!

*Due to a scheduling conflict at the conference center, we've had to move
our October meeting to Thursday instead of Tuesday this month.*

(On the plus side, that means I can actually make it to the meeting.)

Our speaker this month will be Ian Hess - he will be speaking about his
experience with bringing a vulnerable code scanning appliance through beta
to release.

*About the speaker: *

*Ian Hess has previously worked in IT roles, a couple anti-spam companies,
and a vulnerability assessment company.   He has recently escaped the
California Bay Area, and is surviving the midwest cultural differences in
Kansas City.   Currently he is a team lead at RiskIQ, working with a team
of customer success analysts.*

As always, RSVPs are requested, but not required!  Hope to see everyone
there!
