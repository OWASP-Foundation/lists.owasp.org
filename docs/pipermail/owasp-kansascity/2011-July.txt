Greetings:

On June 25, in southern Kansas City, Kansas (at community college JCCC) the
OWASP chapter was present and staffed a booth at an annual conference of
area developers known as KCDC.   (  http://kcdc.info/  )

We took the opportunity to discuss SQL injection, cross site scripting, and
database security with conference attendees who had questions on these
topics.  Approximately 12 people were emailed copies of the .NET remediation
resources from the OWASP wiki web site.

OWASP notepads and lanyards, ordered specially for the occasion, were a big
hit and we gave away all that we came with.

Special thanks to Chris Flowers and August Johnson who displayed leadership
in fielding questions and staffing the booth throughout the day.  A quick
note of thanks also to the conference organizers and sponsoring vendors who
made this happen, Lee and Boon.

See attached picture of the OWASP table at the conference.

We hope to have the opportunity to be present next year.  The OWASP mission
is specifically targeted at the software development process, so it was a
particularly useful venue for our chapter to reach the audience for whom
software security is the message.
