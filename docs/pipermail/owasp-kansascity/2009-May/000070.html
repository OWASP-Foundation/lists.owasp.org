<PRE>We have recent come upon a list of suspected Money Mule accounts.  These accounts are used by man-in-the-browser style attacks to siphon money from a user's bank account (by way of bill payment, transfer, wire, etc).

We are wondering what is the proper thing to do with this data.  We use third party vendors for Bill Payment and Wire/ACH processing.  We currently have thrown around these two ideas.

*         Add validation to the Payee form (we maintain the web screens), and verify that a payee does not have suspected Mule data.

*         Contact the 3rd party vendors and request them to check for this data.  Shouldn't they already be performing this type of validation?

We have already checked to make sure that we are not the host of these Mule Accounts.  Should we try to contact the Bank's that appear in the list?

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
