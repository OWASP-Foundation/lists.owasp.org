<PRE>Greetings OWASP Members:

Following our August informal drainks-and-pizza outing at Longview,
this month we resume our regular speaker meeting format,

Meeting Date: September 22, 2011&#160; 6PM

Meeting Location:
Note that this month the location will be at Alexander Open Systems.
Address is: &#160;12851 Foster Street &#160;&#160;2nd floor &#160;Overland Park KS

Our speaker is Rob Kraft.&#160; Rob is an independent project manager,
architect and developer from Lee's Summit, MO.&#160; He was a certified
trainer on SQL Server and Visual Basic and co-authored a few books
about SQL Server and network security.&#160; He has been developing
software 25 years.&#160; He created <A HREF="http://www.SimpleSQL.net/">http://www.SimpleSQL.net/</A> and

Presentation Title: SQL Injection and XSS: How to and How to prevent

SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) are frequently listed as
the two top web site vulnerabilities being exploited by hackers. In
this session you will learn exactly what these exploits are, see how
hackers use tools to automate this hacking, and most importantly,
learn the steps you can take to minimize the risk of falling victim to
these exploits.


As usual, bring your questions for the speaker and about software
security topics, as it is customary to have a lively Q&amp;A following the
talk.

You are encouraged to forward this meeting invite to any interested people.

See you there,


Mat Caughron
Kansas City OWASP chapter volunteer leader
