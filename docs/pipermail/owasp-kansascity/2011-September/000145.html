<PRE> All:

For Kansas City area employers to post job listings to this Kansas City
chapter mailing list, we will follow these guidelines from one of our
international chapters:
   1. job description specifically involves appsec (information assurance /
software security) skills
   2. local Kansas/Missouri area postings
   3. no recruiters at this time, only direct postings from the hiring
company
   4. let's keep mailing list traffic to a minimum, reduce multiple-postings

Ofer Maor from the OWASP Israeli chapter provides the following guidance
which we seek to follow:
**
*My take here, which has been proven as working wonderfully on the OWASP*
*Israel list (with over 700 subscribers) is to allow job listings on the*
*list. We have a very clear policy on what we allow or disallow in that*
*respect, but we definitely think that our community which consists of many*
*appsec specialists, wants to hear about such job openings.*
* *
*Our policy is quite simple. We allow posting of jobs that require appsec*
*skills (i.e. if you're an AppSec vendor looking for a system admin - no.
but*
*if u'r looking for an application pentester, then by all means do).*
*Naturally the job has to be here (i.e. Israel) - you cannot use the list to
*
*post just jobs anywhere around the globe. You can post each job to the list
*
*one time. If you have several open positions - you should merge them into*
*one mail. We don't have a clear policy on the frequency of separate mails,*
*we play it by ear, but we never had yet an abuse problem with it.*
* *
*Also - should you submit a job, it should have full details about the*
*company and position - it's not a place for headhunters and recruiters who*
*hide the employer. We also encourage the submitters to be the relevant*
*professional person, and not turn this into some HR arena.*
* *
*Bottom line - this works for us. We get jobs posted by people from our own*
*community, who are looking for other appsec specialists in their*
*organizations. There is no abuse here, and it provides value for our*
*members.*
