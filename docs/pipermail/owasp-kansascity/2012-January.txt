Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] Kansas City OWASP chapter,
	first meeting of 2012: Thursday January 19
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVWfufq7koK37UqSHkgGA0OyySh70Cpjp3-YmqfehQAVgg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings KC-OWASP chapter:

In 2011 was another busy year for our chapter, we hosted meetings with
web security and software security presenters from F5, local speaker
Rob Kraft, pen testing tool company Core Impact, and Jim Manico from
SaaS security vendor White Hat.

In addition, we were present at the K.C. Developer conference in June
and B-Sides KC in October to speak or make OWASP materials available
and answer questions about software security.

Plus, we got together to brainstorm about information security, share
job and employment leads, and learn from each other.


With security bugs and compromises continuing to make the news
regularly, you don't have to look very far to see that the OWASP
message remains even more relevant now than ever.  We're excited and
eager to maintain our localized dedication to the OWASP mission of
increasing awareness of vulnerabilities and the remediation insights
that are needed to address them in 2012.


The first Kansas City OWASP chapter event of 2012 will be January 19
at 7PM at the Flying Saucer.
  The Flying Saucer in Kansas City is located at: 101 East 13th Street
 Kansas City, MO 64106-2923

This will be a social event (no formal speaker planned) and a chance
to network with tasty food, drinks and discuss chapter leadership for
2012.

Hope to see you there,



Mat Caughron, KC OWASP volunteer chapter leader
