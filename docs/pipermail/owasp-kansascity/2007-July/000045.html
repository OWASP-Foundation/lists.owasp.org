<PRE>Hello,

I've received feedback on desired OWASP meeting topics and speakers from
a few folks, but far short of the 50 or so people currently subscribed
to the chapter mailing list.  I realize that people are busy or may be
indifferent.  I'm volunteering my time to lead the chapter and all I ask
in return is for you guys to spare a few minutes responding to our
current action items:

- What application security topics are you interested in hearing about
at future meetings?
- Are you interested in speaking at a meeting about a web application
security subject or your experiences implementing related processes or
products?
- Can your employer host one of our meetings?  We currently need a space
that can hold 15-25 people.
- Who can you invite to one of our next meetings?  Point them to our
OWASP page (<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City</A>) and have them
join the mailing list for meeting announcements.


I am tentatively planning our next meeting for September 3, a Tuesday.
I know Wednesday meetings were inconvenient for some people so we'll
give Tuesdays a try.  Once I confirm our speakers I will send out a
formal meeting announcement.

Have a great day.

Subject: RE: [Owasp-kansascity] New chapter leader

Hello,

Thanks for the introduction Dave.  We appreciate your past efforts to
keep the chapter active and attract interesting speakers for the
meetings.  Good luck to you and your family in Dallas.

I've met some of you and hope to meet more as the year progresses.  I've
lived in the Kansas City area for 8 years and have focused on
information security for nearly a decade and a half.  While I have been
involved in the chapter leadership of organizations like the ISSA and
AITP, I'm especially excited about the chance to direct our OWASP
chapter.  We are going through a transition period as application
security attracts more notice and support by local businesses.  I
believe OWASP can play a key role in both smoothing and hastening this
transition.

So let me briefly outline my goals for our chapter and what you can do
to help.

My first priority is to focus on having great chapter meetings.  We've
had some good speakers and I assume that is what draws most of you to
our meetings.  We will continue to focus on discussing the topics that
are most important to our members.  As we find more good local and
national speakers I hope to increase the frequency of chapter meetings
to at least every other month.  

I am aiming for the end of August or the beginning of September for our
next meeting.  I will send out a definite date once we have coordinated
a location and speakers.

My second priority is to attract more people to our chapter.  By
attending not only can they improve their own knowledge and skill, but
they can increase their value to their employer.  In addition, new
members bring in new ideas and new experiences that they can share with
the rest of us.  I'm always excited to hear about the cool application
security work done by people in our community.

So, here are our action items.  If you would, please read through this
list and provide me with feedback in a private email or phone call.

- What application security topics are you interested in hearing about
at future meetings?
- Are you interested in speaking at a meeting about a web application
security subject or your experiences implementing related processes or
products?
- Can your employer host one of our meetings?  We currently need a space
that can hold 15-25 people.
- Who can you invite to one of our next meetings?  Point them to our
OWASP page (<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City</A>) and have them
join the mailing list for meeting announcements.

Your assistance and feedback is important to making this chapter a
success and I thank you in advance for taking the time to be a part of
this effort.

Enjoy your summer and I will see you at our next meeting.
