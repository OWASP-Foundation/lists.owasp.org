	OWASP presence at hackathon
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVUsqtXesHKNSyRykdAs8=jxJT+3V5_CK2J=Dh=aFQ1Ocw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings KC Chapter:

1. Behind the scenes we're hard at work lining up a June meeting.  Details
will be announced here as is customary.

If you would like to speak to the chapter or know an interested speaker,
please send them my way and we'll get it set up.

2. This weblog post contains some solid advice in it on the topic of
dealing with a business that doesn?t want you.

3. HackTheMidwest is advertising the following:
Developers & Designers....are you up for the challenge of building a web,
mobile or cloud app in 24 hours?
*Join us on May 25th/26th at the Heartland Club (8200 Hillcrest Road,
Kansas City Missouri) with 200+ of awesome coders/designers & get ready to
dominate! Bring your laptops, phones, and dev tools.   Build your idea solo
or with a team of up to 5 people. Present it to compete with some of the
midwest's best developers for mad props and great prizes! *
*More info & registration: http://www.hackthemidwest.com *

Any guesses on how much software security they plan to pack into the 24
app-creation efforts?   Um, right.
Well, WE CAN HELP WITH THAT!  Anyone interested in representing organizing
an OWASP presence at that event?  Let's do this!
