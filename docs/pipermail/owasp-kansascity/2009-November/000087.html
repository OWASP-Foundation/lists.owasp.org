<PRE>Forwarding Jeff Williams' keynote from the AppSec D.C. conference to our
local list below.

Locally, we have a really great meeting lined up.  See you December 10 at
JCCC,


   Mat Caughron
   interim president, Kansas City OWASP Chapter
   (816) 866-0628




*OWASP AppSec DC 2009 Conference*
*Jeff Williams, OWASP Board Chair*
*The OWASP Mission*

First I&#8217;d like to introduce the OWASP Board (Tom, Dave, Dinis, Seba, and
myself)
The board runs the OWASP Foundation, the 501c3 nonprofit which provides
support for all the activities that happen at OWASP. Like all the people
involved in OWASP, we volunteer our time to make the project a success. I&#8217;d
like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for all the hard work you
do to make OWASP a success.

I&#8217;d also like to thank Joe for the thoughtful keynote and for focusing on
the entire software supply chain. His focus on malicious intent is right on
and I&#8217;ll be talking about that extensively tomorrow.
If you combine all the materials available through his program and what&#8217;s
available at OWASP, we&#8217;ve got ALL the right stuff out there. But we are
still losing ground.

For years, we have watched as the software market fails to produce secure
applications.
Increasingly, this situation is worsening and there are two key factors.
First, the reliance that we put on our software infrastructure increases
every day. Application software controls our finances, healthcare
information, legal records, and even our military defenses. Secondly,
application software is growing and interconnecting at an unprecedented
rate. The sheer size and
complexity of our software infrastructure are staggering and present novel
security challenges every day.

While we have made some progress in security over the last decade, our
efforts have been almost completely eclipsed by these factors. The software
market and security experts still struggle to eliminate even simple
well-understood problems. Take cross-site scripting (XSS) for example. In
the last decade, XSS has grown from a curiousity to a problem to an
epidemic. Today, XSS has surpassed the buffer overflow as the most prevalent
security vulnerability of all time. It&#8217;s the same for SQL injection. And
CSRF will follow the same pattern too.

These problems, while technically simple, have proven extraordinarily
difficult to eradicate. We can no longer afford to tolerate software that
contains this kind of easily discovered and exploited vulnerabilities. Read
about the RBS WorldPay attack from this week &#8211; the level of coordination and
sophistication required to pull off this attack are stunning.

In addition to risks like this, we are already seriously limiting innovation
in the development of applications that can improve the world.

*Why doesn&#8217;t the software market produce secure software?
*It&#8217;s possible that the risks we focus on are overblown and that the market
is actually working to produce an optimal level of security in our
applications. But the other possibility is that the software market is
broken. Despite what you might hear in economics class, markets are not
perfect. They have failures like monopolies, price- fixing, and speculative
bubbles.

One classic market problem was detailed in a Nobel Prize winning paper by
George Akerlof called &#8220;The Market for Lemons.&#8221; Basically he showed that when
sellers have more information than buyers &#8211; like when you&#8217;re selling your
used car that barely runs &#8211; buyers will discount the price they&#8217;re willing
to pay. That means people with good cars can&#8217;t get a fair price and so they
won&#8217;t sell. And that means you can only buy lemons in the used car market.

Now think about that for software. Buyers really can&#8217;t tell the difference
between secure software and insecure software. So they&#8217;re not willing to pay
more for security.
We need radical innovative ideas to fix the software market. We are not
going to &#8220;hack our way secure&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s going to take a culture change.

The automobile industry made the change over at 30 year period after Ralph
Nader exposed the industry....and today we have cars that have safety
features. The food industry made the change but only after the FDA started
the Nutrition Facts program. Even the cigarette industry has been
dramatically changed through campaigns like the &#8220;Truth...&#8221; campaign.
The OWASP mission is to make application security visible. Creating
transparency goes directly to the heart of what is wrong with the software
market and has the potential to actually change the game.
*
Why is OWASP the right approach?*
OWASP is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the
security of application software. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP
and all of our materials are available under a free and open software
license.

In many ways, we&#8217;re like public radio. This allows us to reach a very broad
audience and it makes it possible for us to avoid difficult commercial
relationships that influence our activities. This freedom from commercial
pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective
information about application security.

I believe this objectivity is absolutely critical. For too long, much of the
appsec information in the market has come from people selling stuff, and our
message has been lost.

*What is OWASP doing?*
Yesterday, OWASP Leaders from around the world got together to discuss our
progress and set our priorities for 2010. Each of our Global Committees
reviewed their accomplishments and we discussed the agenda for the future.
We just established these committees last year and they are already making
huge progress establishing the foundation we need to achieve our mission.

Before I ask Tom to review our 2010 agenda, I&#8217;d like to encourage all of you
to figure out something you can do to change the culture in your team,
company, or industry. In this room are some of the greatest minds in
application security. I challenge you to focus your efforts on those things
that will actually change the world and allow us to fulfill the potential of
what we can achieve with software.
