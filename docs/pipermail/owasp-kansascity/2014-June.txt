Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] Wednesday July 9th @ 5:00 - 6:30 pm at Barley's
	Brewhaus

Greetings Kansas City OWASP Chapter:

We've been seeking an opportunity to have a more social-oriented meeting,
as opposed to the instructional or lecture-style meeting formats that are
typical for our chapter.

I'm happy to announce that we've found just this opportunity, as SecKC is
meeting in July, and we can join them.

July 9th @ 5:00 - 6:30 pm
Barley's Brewhaus
16649 Midland Dr, Shawnee, KS 66217

Please note that this is scheduled for a Wednesday, even though our typical
meeting pattern is on Thursdays.

The social meeting will enable us to network with SecKC immediately
afterwards, who are meeting later that evening in the same general area.
 Details on SecKC are available at:  http://seckc.org/

Hope to see you there!
