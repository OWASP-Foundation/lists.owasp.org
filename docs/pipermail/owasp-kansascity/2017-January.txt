Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] OWASP-KC: No January Meeting! February Meeting
	Date TBD
Message-ID: <CAD6LLGi_1sBV3sx58yUozb0sPUGoB-Zfq8i=ATN_KjNzWxoDoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, KC OWASPers!

For various reasons, namely that I have been too busy with other activities
to have time to get something together, and I have a conflict next Tuesday,
there will not be an OWASP-KC meeting this month.

I've put together a survey to help me with planning for the rest of the
year - if you are interested in OWASP-KC and would like to help set our
direction, please spend 5 minutes to fill it out!  We'll see you all in
February!

Thanks, JF
