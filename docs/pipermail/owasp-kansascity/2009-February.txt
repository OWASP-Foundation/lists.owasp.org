Hi all:

Thanks for a great meeting! Also, thanks to Eric Anders for his interesting
presentation.

Mat Caughron from Fortify Software will present on open source code analysis
tools at our next meeting and that should be a good presentation. We will
then have a discussion on ?Laws and Ethics for White Hat/Black Hat hackers?.
This will be a group discussion and given the discussion we had today should
be a fun one. I will start collecting material and case studies for this and
email the group.

The next meeting will be end of April and I will send out the details in a
few weeks. I will also update the OWASP-KC website (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City)

Here are some future presentation topics I gathered from the group:

* Multi-factor Authentication
* Cloud Computing 
* Application Security Scanning
* Web Application Firewalls
* Penetration Testing for non-pen testers.

Feel free to email the group if you have other suggestions.

Best regards,

Rohini Sulatycki

Several people expressed interest in a presentation related to cloud
computing.  What types of topics and security concerns do people want
covered in a potential presentation.

BTW, here is a recent blog post I published about PCI Compliance and
Cloud computing:
