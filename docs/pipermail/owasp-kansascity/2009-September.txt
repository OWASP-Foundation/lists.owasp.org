Hi Rohini,

Thanks a lot for the invitation.

WAFs used to get a bad rap - perhaps they were overhyped and not
properly utilized - but now most IT security specialists see them as a
useful tool for the toolbox.

My project extends the traditional boundaries of a WAF, using Lua
script to program on the back end (instead of rules that use regex's)
and JavaScript injection - into the HTTP response - to program on the
client side. If you come from a software development background, I'll
explain what a WAF is and what it does. If you come from a
sysadmin/network admin background, I will explain how programming
extends traditional WAF capabilities and can include new classes of
vulnerabilities, including business logic flaws. Yes, your read
correctly: a WAF can mitigate business logic vulnerabilities.

If I can put on my Global Membership Committee hat for a moment, I ask
all of you planning to attend to bring a friend or 2; let's show the
rest of the OWASP world that the KC chapter is a chapter to be
reckoned with!

See you there,
Stephen
