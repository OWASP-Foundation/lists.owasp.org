<PRE>Thanks Bruce. We appreciate your leadership and look forward to your
future participation.

I appreciate this opportunity and hope to be able to advance the OWASP
mission of making web application security more visible so that people
and organizations can make informed decisions about application security
risks. These are interesting times for those of us engaged in this
endeavor so if there are topics that you are interested in hearing at a
future meeting or have a topic that you would like to present please
feel free to contact me.
 
I have a possible location and speakers lined up for the next meeting
which will take place in the latter part of August. I will send out a
definite date once the location and speakers are confirmed.  

Thanks and have a great summer!

Best regards,

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] New leader for the KC OWASP chapter

Hello,

As I'd mentioned in an email around a month ago I've been seeking a
replacement as leader of the OWASP KC chapter.  I'm glad to announce
that Rohini Sulatycki from VML has volunteered to take over this role.
She's been a long time OWASP chapter member and presenter, and I'm sure
she'll do a great job continuing to grow the web application security
community.

I have certainly appreciated the opportunity to be a part of the local
OWASP activities and will continue to participate as I can.  Thanks to
all of you who spoke or otherwise contributed during this time to make
my job a lot easier.  Hopefully everyone will continue to present,
suggest topics, host meetings and attend events to keep our chapter
going strong.

Enjoy your summer!
