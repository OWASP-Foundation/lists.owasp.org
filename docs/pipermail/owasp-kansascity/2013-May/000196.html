Topic:
&quot;Adding Risk Analysis and KPI Reporting to Your WebApp/Vuln Scanning&quot;

Discovering your enterprise vulnerabilities has become much easier
with scanning tools. However, many organizations still struggle with
handling the vulnerabilities that have been identified. Which ones
should we fix first, and which ones can we ignore? Who should be
responsible for the remediation task, and how can we hold them
accountable? These questions and others common struggles for
organizations large and not-so-large. In this presentation, we will
look at:
Methods to consolidate and de-duplicate scanning results from leading
security tools,
Automatically correlate results with assets, incidents, controls,
policies, and other compliance/security data,
Conduct risk scoring of each vulnerability and calculate
inherent/residual risk scores for the vulnerability, asset, system,
facility, and other records,
Assign remediation workflow for vulnerabilities and hold owners accountable,
Correlate scanning results with industry feeds such as US-CERT's NVD
and iDefense,
Report on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as workflow
performance, trends per webapp/platform/Business Unit/Facility, and
other categories.

Speaker Bio:
