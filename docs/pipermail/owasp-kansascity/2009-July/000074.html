<PRE>Thanks to Marjorie for a great presentation. It generated a lot of discussion and I am sure we will have future presentations on this topic.

Tom will be doing a presentation on SQL injection Obfuscation Techniques at a future meeting.

I will see some of you at DEFCON and we will have our next meeting in 2 months.

Have a great summer!
