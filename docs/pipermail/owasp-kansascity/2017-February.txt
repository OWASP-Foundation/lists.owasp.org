Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] February 2017 Meeting - Tuesday, February 28th,
	2017

Hello, OWASP-KC!

It's been a very busy beginning of the year, and I have not been able to
focus on OWASP as I would have liked.  However, I want to keep some
momentum rolling with the chapter.  As such, I'm going to schedule the
February meeting as a planning meeting, because I simply don't have the
cycles to keep things going as a one-person show.

If you are interested in helping to set the direction of our OWASP chapter
and are willing to help out with making things happen, mark your calendar
for Tuesday, February 28th, at 6:30pm.  Location is still TBD, but will be
someplace with food and drink, probably in the general vicinity of the
usual meeting place.

If you think you'll be able to make it, please RSVP at Eventbrite so I can
make sure to plan for a location with sufficient space.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
