In today&#8217;s world, we rely on technology and the Internet for a variety of
transactions, communication and information &#8211; at home, in school and at the
workplace. While we are familiar with the myriad of conveniences provided
through Internet use, it is difficult to stay abreast of all the changes
and the potential risks presented by the Internet. We are all &#8220;virtual
neighbors&#8221; in cyberspace, and what we do, or don&#8217;t do, can affect many
others.

The Nebraska Cyber Security Conference will assist in raising our awareness
of cyber security and help in protecting all of us in cyberspace. If we do
our part individually, we can have a tremendous positive impact
collectively on our state&#8217;s cyber security.

This will be valuable time learning from skilled industry experts. The day
will be filled with a variety of breakout sessions that will encompass
different areas of information security and technology.


Presentations
Beyond the System: Creating a Secure Enterprise
Presenter: Albert Decker, First Data Government Solutions
This presentation discusses security from an Enterprise perspective. The
intent is to create an understanding of controls that apply to enterprises
rather than those at a system level. It makes the audience aware of how
security and privacy should be pervasive concerns throughout the
enterprise.
Experience Level: Beginner

Blockchains: A Critical Look
Presenter: Abhishek Parakh, University of Nebraska Omaha
Prerequisite: General knowledge about Blockchain
We will take a critical look at the blockchain technology and question
whether the current enthusiasm about it is justified. Does it have any
valid use cases? What kind of security guarantees does it really provide?
Experience Level: Intermediate

Cybersecurity Escape Room Challenge
Presenter: Cheryl O'Dell, University of Nebraska
IT Security Awareness is a struggle. People want to use computers and
browse the Internet safely; but do not really want to sit through a
discussion or watch videos to be made aware of the latest security threats.
This session will be an interactive and fun way to participate in security
awareness. Do you have what it takes to solve the puzzles and catch the
spy? Come and have some fun with a group of friends, or come make some new
friends while figuring out the clues to solve the case in this
Cybersecurity Escape Room challenge.
Experience Level: Beginner

Cyber Security Threats &amp; Challenges
Presenter: JR Noble, University of Nebraska
Prerequisite: General understanding of information technology and security
Cyber attacks have brought a paradigm shift in how we secure and protect
information. Today, NATO ranks attacks from phishing and malware among its
greatest concerns. These attacks are attractive to hackers, who find them
to be cheap, hard to track, and even harder to attribute. As budgets rise
and fall, awareness of cyber threats and challenges has never been more
critical. Theft of intellectual property, loss of research and attacks on
the reputation of the organization are among the challenges managed by our
team. Join the UNL Cyber Security team for a talk about today&#8217;s cyber
threats and how they are impacting organizations around the world.
Experience Level: Beginner

Deserialization Attacks in Those Fancy New JavaScript Web Apps!
Presenter: Andy Freeborn, ACI Worldwide
Prerequisite: Basic to intermediate pen testing knowledge
Deserialization attacks are a hot topic in security, but often times these
attacks seem like magic. Exploitation of these attacks tend to happen in
complex systems that require knowledge in the setup of all the things. To
help you better understand why and how these attacks work, we&#8217;re using an
intentionally broken system with a quick and easy setup. We&#8217;ll cover
everything to look for in your personal assessments.
Experience Level: Intermediate

Every Day is Hunting Season &#8212; Threat Hunting in All Organizations
Presenter: Ben Boyd, Integration Partners
Prerequisite: Interest in Cybersecurity
Introduce the topic of cyber threat hunting and how organizations of all
sizes can secure themselves by actively hunting for threats.
Experience Level: Beginner

GDPR: 4 Month Update
Presenter: Jacob Tewes, Esq., Kutak Rock LLP
The General Data Privacy Regulation went into effect on May 25. In this
session, we will examine the ways it has (and hasn&#8217;t) been enforced, with
an emphasis on extraterritorial application against U.S. companies.
Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the regulation, the
enforcement priorities we have been able to glean so far, and some
actionable steps they can take to minimize their own risk.
Experience Level: Intermediate

How AI is Fueling the Cyber Security Revolution
Presenter: John Bloomer, Check Point Software
The industrial revolution was powered by coal and steam. They were the
power that enabled innovation and propelled the world down the road that
has brought us to where we are today. The next revolution is on the
horizon, and it&#8217;s an information revolution. Smartphones, smart homes and
smart assistants are proliferating our lives. Artificial intelligence is
becoming in integral contributor to how this technology adds value to the
our lives. The capabilities of the cyber security ecosystem must keep pace
with this evolution. During this session we will cover how artificial
intelligence is being used to fuel the next generation of cyber security
ecosystems. We will see how it can be used to improve accuracy, speed and
efficiency of enforcement technologies while enhancing the information used
to make business and security decisions.
Experience Level: Intermediate

How Cyber Crimes Affect Health Care Systems
Presenter: Tonya Ngotel, University of Nebraska Medical Center -
Preparedness Education, &amp; Allison Dye, Student, University of Nebraska
Medical Center
Attendees will hear real-life examples of cyber crimes affecting health
care facilities across the U.S. and how the simple act of training and
exercises help deter those crimes from happening.
Experience Level: Beginner

How Sophisticated Attacks on Windows Machines Work &amp; How to Detect Them
Presenter: Jose Bravo, IBM
Prerequisite: Basic Windows security
In Part 1: We will be compromising a machine that is fully patched, with
Windows Defender and protected by UAC (Usear Access Control). In Part 2: We
will be compromising a Windows Domain Controller and a workstation in the
domain obtaining a Ticket Golden Ticket good for ten years.
Experience Level: Intermediate

It was a Dark &amp; Stormy Night: Using Security Storytelling to Persuade Purse
Strings
Presenter: Karla Carter, Bellevue University
Prerequisite: A good sense of humor!
Storytelling is a time-honored method to capture attention, simplify
concepts, reinforce retention, and spur engagement. Also, it&#8217;s just plain
more interesting to hear a story than sit through 30 dry slides. Stories
help listeners connect the new to the old. Success in marketing often
relies on either telling familiar stories in new ways or telling new
stories dressed in familiar garb. Getting support and funding for
cybersecurity projects, including cybersecurity awareness training, is a
type of marketing. Therefore, if you can harness the power of stories you
have a better chance at persuading those who hold the purse strings.
Additionally, the process of crafting the stories, a type of scenario
planning, enriches the cybersecurity understanding of groups and
individuals directly involved in practicing cybersecurity. Once the
concepts have been introduced (sorry, slides will be involved, fewer than
30, though ;-) - but no snakes this time, although some toy white cats may
show up) participants will be unleashed into small groups to sketch out
their own persuasive scenarios, followed by general discussion.
Experience Level: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced

Reinventing PC Security
Presenter: Kurt Lysy, HP
Prerequisite: Basic understanding of PC security at a high level and
understanding the current overall security landscape and common security
threats
It&#8217;s no longer a matter of &#8220;if,&#8221; but &#8220;when.&#8221; As the world becomes more
mobile and connected, cyber attacks continue to rapidly grow in frequency
and sophistication, placing your company&#8217;s data and personal information at
risk. Are you protected? While organizations are aware of the growing
threat, most are overly focused on security software and data center
protection while neglecting securing client and end-point devices. HP looks
at client end-point security holistically; a multi-layered approach rooted
in hardware. Security that&#8217;s built-in, not bolted on. HP&#8217;s approach to
security is unparalleled in the PC industry, and this is only the
beginning.
Experience Level: Advanced

Structuring Security for Success
Presenter: Matt Morton, University of Nebraska
Learn how the University of Nebraska restructured security to better align
with the organizational mission without compromising the security of the
faculty, staff and students. Based upon organizational principles from
research at Carnegie Mellon University, NU developed a standards-based
structure to move the security program to a higher level while increasing
efficiency.
Experience Level: Intermediate

The Privacy Awakening: Past, Present, Future, &amp; Why You Should Care
Presenter: Christopher Cashmere, University of Nebraska
The realization that corporations, the government, and even our friends and
families now have more visibility into our private lives than at any time
in the past is causing a privacy awakening. While some of the loss of
privacy is self-inflicted, much of real damage comes from big data,
analytics, and the rate at which things are changing. Technological
advances, along with our willingness to trade our privacy for security or
convenience, has created a seemingly perfect storm where privacy is being
eroded. Using stories, imagery and examples from past and present, this
talk will build on the privacy awakening and focus on how our views on
privacy are shaped by our history, culture, technology, and human nature.
Attendees will come away with an awareness of where have we been, where we
are, where all this may be going, why you should care, and more
importantly, why as a society we should all care about privacy.
Experience Level: Beginner

Who Are the Bad Guys and Why Do They Want to Hack Your Organization?
Presenter: Jeff Geiger, CrowdStrike Services
Jeff Geiger is a native and self-avowed &#8220;permanent Nebraskan.&#8221; Jeff will
describe a diverse set of threat actors, their tactics and their motives.
As a developer and contributor to several open-source and commercial
security projects, he&#8217;ll highlight how you can prepare your organization to
counter both targeted and commodity threats, through understanding the
people on the other side of the keyboard and preparing your network
accordingly.
