Greetings:

As noted in the day's KCStar newspaper, State of Kansas can certainly use
the OWASP body of knowledge and talent to address the application security
findings in their recently released audit:

 Particularly relevant for what the state is facing is OWASP's guidance
around password creation:

Special thanks to Steve Jensen for his engaging and dynamic presentation on
a conjunctive approach to software security.  Slides to be posted as per
usual practice.

Next meeting is January 9th at the McCoy's Foundry in Westport area.

We are seeking speakers for February/March/April and are eager to get dates
and times lined up as well.

Happy Holidays, we'll see you all in the New Year,
