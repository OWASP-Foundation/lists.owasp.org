Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] No Meeting for July
Message-ID: <CAD6LLGgtH9kvnbO92TkCUFOS=QwZBrUF04uichGC1p9_Hk9pXw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all - Apologies for the relatively late notice, but I don't have a
speaker lined up for this month, and I have a ton of stuff going on right
now, so I'm going to cancel this month's meeting.   I suspect attendence
will be low anyway due to other folks having a lot of pre-BlackHat/DefCon
prep going on, so I'll see everyone in August!
