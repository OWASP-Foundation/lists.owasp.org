Hi all:

We had a good meeting yesterday. Tom Stripling from Security PS gave a great
presentation on the OWASP conference and provided a good overview of
Clickjacking.  Copies of the presentations and videos from the OWASP
conference can be viewed at:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference

We then had an animated round table discussion on security  code audits.
Thanks to Aaron Hoyt and Mike Marshall from VML for attending and providing
the development team perspective. We will continue this discussion in the
future. 

Kelly Gernhart from JCCC attended the meeting and has kindly agreed to let
us use the facilities for future meetings. If you have not yet had a chance
to visit the new Regnier Center at JCCC it?s worth a visit.

Our next quarterly meeting will be sometime in February. We have speakers
for the next meeting but if you are interested in speaking at a future event
or have some topics that you would like to see presented please send me an
email.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Rohini Sulatycki
