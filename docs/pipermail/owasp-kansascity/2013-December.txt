*Mobile App Security Assessment*
Presented by Michael Born, Solutionary

*When: *December 5, 12-1pm.  Room will open at 11:45 AM for socializing and
pizza
*Where: *Peter Kiewit Institute, UNO's Pacific Street Campus, 1110 S. 67th
Street, Omaha, NE

*Don't forget *about the warm up video! Michael was *so kind* to provide
OWASP Omaha with a warm up video, which you can view on our YouTube channel
here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRnj816ec-8. Since he will be talking
about how to *use *intercepting proxies for mobile assessments, you might
want to know how to set it up.  This video shows you the basics of setting
up a Kali linux distro with the Burp Suite for mobile testing.


See you tomorrow!

Zac

Greetings KC Chapter Members:

This time of year it is hard to plan too far in advance for events
given the weather.  What we'd like to do is have a "2014 events
planning" discussion over a pint.  How about December 26?

Since our last several meetings have been of the serious-presenter
variety, this month we'll mix things up with a meet-and-greet at a
local pub.  Location is still being determined.  So far, suggested
venues are: Flying Saucer on 13th Street or McCoy's in Westport or the
Peanut in Lee's Summit's old downtown.  Any others to consider?

Some useful news links you may not have seen elsewhere:

Recent crypto-leak research:
 http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/

BayThreat conference video feeds, including one on breaking content
security policy:
 http://bit.ly/18zlMSB

Our Very Own Chapter Twitter Feed, Thanks Justin!:
 https://twitter.com/owaspkc

So, this is happening:
 https://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-objective-c/


We'll be providing more details as to location prior to December 26.

If your company would like to sponsor drinks in exchange for some
visibility, that can be arranged.

Best regards,



Mat
