<PRE>Hello,

Thanks to those of you who attended our September 6th meeting at
Centriq.  I really enjoyed Bob Phelps talk about web application
security practices from a regulatory perspective.  And I had fun talking
about challenge question authentication with those of you brave enough
to disclose your favorite color.

You can find a brief account of the meeting and presentations (including
slides) here:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City_September_2007_Meeting">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City_September_2007_Meeting</A>

I also want to thank Rohini Sulatycki for inviting three new guests from
VML to the meeting.  They were great additions to the group and I hope
more of you find folks to bring to our events.

We still plan to have another Kansas City OWASP chapter meeting in early
November.  I need to hear from volunteers interested in doing any type
of presentation (from 15 - 60 minutes).  Current topics that people have
expressed an interest in include the following:

- Performing code reviews
- Federated identity systems
- Threat modeling

Please let know as soon as possible if you would like to speak on these
topics or others.

----
