Greetings, all!? After a hiatus in June, we're back on for July!? (As always, apologies for the short notice - I was on vacation, and had unexpectedly limited internet access.)? Unfortunately, our usual location is unavailable on the 4th Tuesday this month, so RiskIQ (my employer) has been so kind as to allow us to use their space.? It's ... less convenient than the Kauffman Center location for some people ... but there will be pizza and drinks, so hopefully it will be worth going out of your way for.??
Our speaker will be Mike Wyatt, Security Researcher and Manager of Product Operations at RiskIQ, who will be speaking about Investigating Internet Cybercrime.? ?He will be showing us how some common malicious payloads can be used to detect malicious sites and scams.?
RSVPs are requested, so we know how much pizza to order, but as always, not required!??Share this event on Facebook
                    and Twitter
                    We hope you can make it.Best,OWASP-KC
