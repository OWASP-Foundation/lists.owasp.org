Hi all:
> 
I hope that everyone is having a great year so far! I am pleased to announce
our next quarterly meeting on Thursday, April 30th from 6-8 PM at JCCC in
Room 270 in the Regnier Center. We have a couple of very exciting
presentations so don?t miss this meeting!

Agenda:
 
6:00-6:45: ?Techniques for Application Source Code Review? presented by Mat
Caughron, Fortify Software
 
6:45 ? 7:00: break
 
7:00 ? 8:00: ?Laws and Ethics for White Hat/Black Hat hackers?  Round Table
discussion

As always, please let me know if there are any topics that you are
interested in hearing/presenting in future meetings. Our group relies upon
participation from its members and if you have any interest in presenting at
a future meeting I will be more than happy to help you.

Finally I would like to thank Kelly Gernhart, Assistant Dean of Computing
Sciences & Information Technology at JCCC for allowing us to use the JCCC
