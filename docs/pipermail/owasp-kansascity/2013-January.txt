Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] reminder 6:30PM Wed. Jan. 9 - KC-OWASP meeting -
	with Live Demo's
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVUvG=A4YBJzXGWK6jc1K-dG_R7z5fb8DFm3t1_mYYGVRA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Kansas City OWASP chapter


Tomorrow evening Barry Archer will be doing a couple of quick
demonstrations of three web application attacks (publicly disclosed and
fixed) that he learned about at BlackHat.

   1.  Using XSS (cross site scripting) in an email field to steal a
privileged PHP SessionID that then is used to log in as an admin.

   2.  Blind SQL injection on an application using MySQL on the back end.
 This demonstrates how timing was used to enumerate an MD5 hash from a
vulnerable
application.

   3.  A nifty example of how LFI (Local File Inclusion) in a PHP application
can result in a remote shell.

Barry will talk about how these vulnerabilities get exploited and,
most importantly,
how to spot and prevent similar issues in your applications.

As usual there will be ample opportunities to meet and chat with Kansas
City's finest and friendliest information security folks.

Location is in Westport at McCoy's Foundry (in the meeting room between the
Foundry and the Patio side of the restaurant so we can use the big screen
for presentation purposes.)

Meeting formally begins at 6:30 and the formal reservation is from 6PM to
8PM.  We do not have a corporate sponsor yet for food or drink, if your
company would like this opportunity, please contact the chapter lead (info
below)

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] Call for Presentations: SnowFROC 2013
 cybersecurity conference (Denver, CO)
Message-ID: <CAFSbxesaUfJj7KtkZSEL_OiUcC+D89JhMum+5U_qby+8QHrPbQ@mail.gmail.com>

*=== FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION ===*
(Please redistribute this announcement to colleagues and peers as
appropriate.)

The Colorado OWASP <https://www.owasp.org> chapters are pleased to announce
that the 5th annual Front Range OWASP Conference
(SnowFROC<http://www.snowfroc.com>)
will occur on Thursday, March 28, 2013 in Denver, Colorado, USA.

Effective immediately, the SnowFROC planning committee is accepting
proposals for presentations on topics surrounding cyber security and web
application development and operations.


*Criteria and Submission*
Potential speakers may submit abstracts of proposed presentations to
https://dev.aerstone.com/snowfroc/cfp.

The submission tool will format newly-created abstracts automatically, but
all uploaded materials must adhere to the following requirements:

   - Only Microsoft Word documents, PDFs, rich-text format documents, and
   text files will be accepted.
   - Author names, affiliations, email addresses, and other
   personally-identifiable information must be stripped from uploaded
   documents.
   - Presentations must contain a title at the top of the document.
   - Presentation overviews should not exceed 300 words.

Presenters will be allotted 45-minute time slots. One abstract must be
submitted for each presentation considered. All abstracts must be written
in English.


*Evaluation*
The following criteria will determine abstract rankings:

   - Applicability to the requested topics (see below)
   - Relevance to web application development and operations
   - Relevance to the cybersecurity Industry at large
   - Relevance to the OWASP foundation
   - Strength of presentation (as determined by the review committee)
   - Timeliness of submission

Submitted abstracts will be assessed by selected members of the Colorado
OWASP chapters. All reviews will be blind and reviewers will not have
visibility to author information.


*Dates and Deadlines*
Abstract collection begins immediately and will continue until all speaking
slots are filled. Rolling evaluations will occur with selected papers
announced each Monday beginning on February 11th. Although the rolling
format extends the submission period significantly, potential speakers are
advised to submit as early as possible in order to maximize chances for
selection.

Final presentations of accepted abstracts must be submitted for review by
March 17th. Templates and other presentation formatting constraints will be
made available to selected speakers directly.

All accepted presentations will be delivered during conference proceedings
on March 28th, 2013.

v2.0<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement>
.

*Anyone who cannot or will not abide by these terms will not be permitted
to present at the conference.*

In addition, presenters must agree to allow use of abstract titles, text,
and speaker names and bios for conference promotion. With speaker consent,
presentation materials will be distributed to conference attendees and will
be archived for future reference. With speaker consent, presentations will
be recorded and archived.
