Ed Welsh recently sent this my way, so I'm forwarding it along.  Is anyone using these shared objects
in their development?  Personally I did not even know these files existed, let alone they could be
used to store interesting or potentially sensitive information.

Here is a new spot to check when information gathering a web application: 
 
C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player\#SharedObjects
 
There is an object browser called "SolVe" on SourceForge.  Many applications are using the Flash
shared object model to store Flash "cookies" (up to 100K).  Bank of America is putting the SiteKey
info there when you authorize a PC for their site.
 
Key points:
 
- Clearing browser history, cookies, and cache does not clear Flash objects.
- Many sites are not encrypting the contents.
- At least one framework (dojo) is making this storage automatic for developers via object models.

Well I downloaded the SolVE tool and used it to browse some shared objects (.sol files) on my
computer.  Unfortunately, it errored out on some of them, including my Bank of America file (the tool
probably needs to be updated since it is from 2004).  The BoA file is called PassMark.sol.  From Ed's
email, I believe that is where BoA stores info to know whether or not you've accessed their site from
a particular computer.  Interestingly, Vanguard recently adopted the same SiteKey functionality and I
see a file called PassMark.sol for them too.  
(Hmm, I guess I just admitted I have BoA and Vanguard accounts.  That's okay - I'm protected by
SiteKey!)

in protecting a database.  Hopefully they keep the product pushing to a minimum.

I imagine everyone on this list received the OWASP newsletter.  If not,
you'll find it below.  One of the links points to a write-up of a
possible solution to the Adobe Reader XSS issue we've been hearing about
recently.  OWASP has published a way to prevent the attack by forcing
any requests to PDF files to go through a Java filter.  The details are
here:
 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PDF_Attack_Filter_for_Java_EE
 
Obviously, this only works if you're on a server running a Java
application.  I managed to find some code for .NET as well:
 
http://www.techplay.net/
 
 
But what if you're trying to prevent the attack on a server with only
static content or applications written in something other than Java or
.NET?  There are other ways to reduce your risk.  You can instruct the
browser to download the file instead of opening it in the vulnerable
Adobe plug-in by adding HTTP headers to the response (for PDF documents
only):
 
Content-Type: application/octet
Content-Disposition: Attachment
 
These headers both tell the browser that the file is a download and
should not be opened in the plug-in.  There is still a risk that the
browser will ignore these headers and open the file in the Adobe plug-in
anyway, but this should prevent the attack in all modern and/or
mainstream browsers.  I haven't tested some of the older ones, so let me
know if you do.  This approach isn't foolproof, but it's a quick way to
drastically reduce the risk of the attack.
 
Hope this helps,
Tom

has been very busy on the new version of WebScarab, which is not
complete, but is already in a very usable state (I already prefer it to
the current version). Rogan needs your help in testing this version and
sending in your comments. Quote from OWASP WebScarab NG Project
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_NG_Project> :
WebScarab-NG is a complete rewrite of the old WebScarab application,
with a special focus on making the application more user-friendly. To
this end, WebScarab-NG makes use of the Spring Rich Client Platform to
provide the user interface features. By using the Spring Rich Client
Platform, WebScarab-NG automatically gains things like default buttons,
keyboard shortcuts, support for internationalisation, etc.

Featured Story: Two free Java EE filters for CSRF, Reflected XSS, and
Adobe XSS


OWASP contributors from Aspect Security <http://www.aspectsecurity.com/>
have developed two new Java EE filters to protect against common web
attacks. Just add a few lines to your web.xml file and enjoy the
protection. 

	CSRF and Reflected XSS Filter for Java EE
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF_Guard>  
	This filter adds a random token to forms and URLs that prevent
an attacker from executing both CSRF
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF>  and reflected XSS
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS>  attacks. 

	Adobe XSS Filter for Java EE
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PDF_Attack_Filter_for_Java_EE>  
	This filter protects against the recent XSS attacks on PDF
files. By using a redirect and an encrypted token, this filter ensures
that dangerous attacks are not passed into the Adobe reader plugin. 






Featured Story: "Automated Scanner vs. The OWASP Top Ten"


Apart from some shameless marketing plus and its real intention with
this paper
<http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/
01-09-2007/0004502553&EDATE=> , WhiteHat Security has published a good
paper on the limitations of Web Application Security Scanners
capabilities to detect the [OWASP_Top_Ten_Project OWASP Top 10]
vulnerabilities (which btw, all vendors claim they do). I actually think
that the examples are quite basic, but they are good enough for the
argument presented. 

You can download this paper from [1]
<http://www.whitehatsec.com/home/assets/OWASPTop10ScannersF.pdf>  

Quote: "The OWASP Top Ten is a list of the most critical web application
security flaws - a list also often used as a minimum standard for web
application vulnerability assessment (VA) and compliance. There is an
ongoing industry dialog about the possibility of identifying the OWASP
Top Ten in a purely automated fashion (scanning). People frequently ask
what can and can't be found using either white box or black box
scanners. This is important because a single missed vulnerability, or
more accurately exploited vulnerability, can cause an organization
significant financial harm. Proper expectations must be set when it
comes to the various vulnerability assessment solutions." 

Note: I haven't seen any Web App Scannor vendor responses, so if you
spot it let me know.

Here is an easy read that I came across on the vulnerabilities in SiteKey Security.

http://cr-labs.com/publications/SiteKey-20060718.pdf

......

"If the challenge was correctly answered, the server stores a bypass token so questions won't be asked
again:

Cookie: PMData="PMV2AAhOQWNc(truncated);Expires=Wed, 09-May-2007 20:55:50 GMT;Path=/"
Flash shared object: PassMark="PMV2AAhOQWNc(truncated)"

...

Actual security comes from Flash Player's ban on (1) filesystem access by Internet scripts; and (2)
cross-site scripting. The overall safety of the SiteKey token is a function of Flash Player, operating
system and browser
security, which block access to local files. The token is reasonably safe if these things are working
correctly.

...

Enable the "secure" flag on all cookies and set the "secure" option on persistent objects in Flash 8
and later versions (the "secure" option is new in Flash 8)"

Well I downloaded the SolVE tool and used it to browse some shared objects (.sol files) on my
computer.  Unfortunately, it errored out on some of them, including my Bank of America file (the tool
probably needs to be updated since it is from 2004).  The BoA file is called PassMark.sol.  From Ed's
email, I believe that is where BoA stores info to know whether or not you've accessed their site from
a particular computer.  Interestingly, Vanguard recently adopted the same SiteKey functionality and I
see a file called PassMark.sol for them too.  
(Hmm, I guess I just admitted I have BoA and Vanguard accounts.  That's okay - I'm protected by
SiteKey!)
