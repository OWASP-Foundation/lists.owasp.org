We are fortunate to present two KC-OWASP meetings this month: November 10
and November 17

Please mark on your calendars these two dates for OWASP meetings in
November.  There are no plans for OWASP meetings in December, as scheduling
is always particularly challenging around the holidays.

Location: Hosted by Sirius Computer Solutions
10801 Mastin Boulevard, Suite 900   Overland Park, KS   66210

For those not familiar, Core Impact is a penetration testing toolkit and
framework, often compared to Metasploit.
Recent features of Core Impact called WebVerify now address web security
weaknesses and flaws.  The presentation will cover the new
web functionalities such as session manipulation and attacks against web
infrastructure and the speakers will be
available to answer quetsions about the network and other non-web-focused
features in Core Impact after their talk.

enterprise level web security services in your organization.

These are both phenomenal opportunities to learn about the state of the art
in web security.  See you there!

 XSS Past,

Message-ID: <90e6ba6e8472531b1904b0b364a8@google.com>

You have been invited to the following event.

Title: OWASP KC - Jim Manico - Ghosts of XSS Past, Present and Future
This talk will discuss the past methods used for cross-site scripting (XSS)  
defense that were only partially effective. Learning from these lessons, we  
will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that are effective,  
but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then finish with a  
discussion of future XSS defense mythologies that shift the burden of XSS  
defense from the developer to various frameworks. These include  
auto-escaping template technologies, browser-based defenses such as Content  
Security Policy, and Javascript sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project  
and JSReg.

Jim Manico is the VP Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security and has  
been an active member of OWASP since 2008.
When: Thu Nov 17 6pm ? 8pm Central Time
Where:  Johnson County Community College Regnier Center room 344 Johnson
