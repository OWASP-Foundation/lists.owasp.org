Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] OWASP KC Chapter Meeting - Nov 7 @ 6 PM
Message-ID: <498A13DC993C1D4CAC5675ABC6DDBCFD57E20E@spsdc1.securityps.local>

Hello,

Just a final reminder that tomorrow (Nov 7) is our final KC OWASP
chapter meeting of the year.  I hope that a lot of you can make it.

As our main speaker, Tom Stripling will be discussing The Dangers of
Third-Party Content.  He's actually presenting on this same topic next
week at the national OWASP conference
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_%26_WASC_AppSec_2007_Conference),
so you will all get a free preview before the paying attendees.

Here's the description of his talk:

It is now commonplace for web applications to include content from other
sites, partners, and advertisers.  If this content isn't handled
correctly, applications are left vulnerable to attack.  By examining a
variety of attacks that can be executed through third-party content, we
can better evaluate application risk and design countermeasures.

Session Learning Objectives
* Determine the threat posed by third-party content, given trends in
Internet content and specific risks associated with each form of
third-party content inclusion
* Demonstrate attacks against a live web application that exploit flawed
security assumptions in the inclusion of third-party content
* Analyze the effectiveness of various application security
countermeasures to combat the threat
* Enable developers and penetration testers to better identify and
prevent the risks associated with the use of third-party content in web
applications

Tom Stripling is a senior application security consultant with an
extensive background in web application development, penetration
testing, and risk assessment. In his role at Security PS, he helps
clients uncover application vulnerabilities and secure the software
development process. In his spare time, Tom is an avid researcher of
application security attacks, vulnerabilities, and best practices.


** We also have time for another person to give a brief 15-45 minute
presentation on web application security.  This can be a technical
demonstration, conference review, or open discussion about a web
application security topic.  Please let me know if you'd like to grab
this spot.

Thanks to those of you who showed up at our November KC OWASP chapter
meeting.  We had a great turnout of around a dozen people, many of which
were new faces.  I hope to see you all again at future meetings.

Tom Stripling's presentation did a great job introducing the challenges
of securely integrating third-party content and produced some good
discussions among the group.  Thank you Tom for taking time to speak to
our chapter.  If you would like to review Tom's presentation slides, you

I mentioned that there is a national OWASP group for users of LinkedIn.
Joining this group shows people reviewing your profile that you
recognize the importance of application security and support OWASP
efforts.  You can join the group by following this link:

I am already working on our next KC OWASP chapter meeting for the end of
January.  The plan was to have a speaker discuss application security
code reviews.  However, one of the ideas brought up at our meeting was
to have a panel discussion about a topic.  I've facilitated this type of
group before and they can be a great way of quickly covering different
perspectives on a topic.

While I'm all for this idea I need participants for the panel.  I will
map out the planned areas of discussion ahead of time so you won't be
put on the spot.  All we need is 3 volunteers to make this work.  If you
are willing to share your experiences and opinions about application
security code review I would like for you to send me an email.
