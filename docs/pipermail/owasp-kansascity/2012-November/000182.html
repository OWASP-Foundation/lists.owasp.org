Kansas City Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) chapter
meeting announcement:

When:   Thursday, December 13, 2012 from 6-8pm

Presentation Title: Implementing Security Testing within the SDLC.

Speaker:  Based in Joplin Missouri, Stephen Jensen is presently a
consultant with British Telecom's global services unit, and has been
performing web application security assessments for over 9 years. With
a background as a software developer, it was his experiences within
the software industry that led him to shift his focus more towards the
security aspect of software.  Steve will be covering:

1) Overview of different software development models (traditional
models never had security in as a requirement)
2) What is the purpose of an application assessment?
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Automated assessment
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Manual assessment
3) What is the purpose of a code review?
&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; Automated review
&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; Manual review
4) Benefits of doing conjunctive testing versus doing one or the other.

Steve is a great speaker and this is an important topic for any
company that produces or uses software.

Where:  Room 183 in the Regnier Center at Johnson County Community College
 12345 College Boulevard Overland Park, KS 66210-1299

See you there!
