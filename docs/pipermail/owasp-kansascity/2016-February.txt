Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] February OWASP-KC Meeting
Message-ID: <CAD6LLGgZ8nLbV4tVL0UVbU8kBuqMtdrOCz0SYCqR21OcCtt7rA@mail.gmail.com>

Happy Monday, everyone!

The February 2016 OWASP-KC meeting will be held on February 23rd, 2016, in
the Brookside room at the Kauffman Foundation Conference Center (same place
as last time, different room).

We don't have an outside speaker for this meeting (unless someone steps up
at the last minute), but I'm putting together a fun and interesting
presentation that I think will prove interesting for everyone.

February Meeting of the Open Web Application Security Project - Kansas City
Chapter.

This month's meeting will not have a featured speaker - instead Justin
Ferguson (volunteer chapter leader) will be presenting some real-world
Application Security case studies.   We will go in-depth with several
recently-published Application Security vulnerabilities, to show how
inattention to AppSec can have real-world consequences (or maybe just help
a hacker get a free lunch).  If you're trying to make a case for an AppSec
program in your workplace, this presentation might just give you some
ideas.  If you're an InfoSec guy trying to explain to your developers what
this AppSec thing is all about, bring them along!

Our OWASP Project Spotlight this month will be on the OWASP Zap Proxy,
which is a valuable tool for discovering some of the vulnerabilities we'll
be talking about as well.

We'll also try to devote part of our meeting time to general
discussion/networking.

As always, it's not required that you reserve a ticket (and definitely not
required that you use your real name), but it is appreciated so we can make
sure we have space for everyone.

Reserve your ticket at
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-kc-february-2016-tickets-21442138012!

Hope to see you all there - as always, please email with any questions,
concerns, or opinions!

*PROJECTS: Announcing GSoC 2016, New Releases from OWASP ZSC, ESAPI,
WebGoat 7, and a ZAP User Survey*

*Got an Idea for Google Summer of Code 2016?*

The time of the year has come to propose ideas for GSoC 2016.

We haven't been selected yet, but we need to populate this list of ideas as
part of the organization application process.

We have created a list here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSOC2016_Ideas
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/91418889ff/f385211697/utm_content=&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eowasp%2Eorg%2Findex%2Ephp%2FGSOC2016_Ideas&utm_campaign=February%202016%20Community%20News%20Flash>

We have removed last year's ideas and only left some as "example ideas".
Please add more ideas to this list as you wish. You should put your ideas
down before the application deadline, ie before February 19th. You will be
able to add more idea after the deadline but we would like to present to
Google as many ideas as possible.

*OWASP ZSC*

We are preparing to start developing a powerful obfuscation tool OWASP ZSC
and looking for some volunteers to contribute the tool project.

OWASP ZSC Project
OWASP ZSC is an open source software in python language which lets you
generate customized shellcodes and convert scripts to an obfuscated script.
This software can be run on Windows/Linux/OSX under python.

Usage of shellcodes
Shellcodes are small codes in assembly which could be use as the payload in
software exploiting. Other usages are in malwares, bypassing anti viruses,
obfuscated codes and etc.

Usage of Obfuscate Codes
Can be use for bypassing antiviruses, code protections, same stuff etc?

Why use OWASP ZSC ?
According to other shellcode generators such as metasploit tools and etc,
OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect.
OWASP ZSC encoders are able to generate shellcodes with random encodes that
lets you to get thousands of new dynamic shellcodes with the same job in
just a second, it means you will not get a same code if you use random
encodes with same commands, and that makes OWASP ZSC one of the bests!
otherwise it's going to generate shellcodes for other operation systems in
the next versions. It?s the same story for the code obfuscation.

There are more details about how it works and user guides
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/91418889ff/17d4d5d4ac>
and also how to develop
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/91418889ff/1ffdcbd2f7>.

*WebGoat*

Webgoat v.7 released. Listen to our podcast
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/91418889ff/83f302441d>
as Bruce Mayhew explains the new version. The WebGoat Project started 10
years ago and has had over 1,000,000 downloads. Version 7.0 is being
released this week. Matt Miller caught with Bruce Mayhew, project lead, to
talk about the history of the project, what has been updated in version 7,
and what he foresees as the future of this project. Project Page:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/CategorY:OWASP_WebGoat_Project

*New ESAPI Release*

ESAPI project co-leader, Kevin Wall announced his team has just tagged (and
signed) a new ESAPI release. The tag name is esapi-2.1.0.1. There are 36
GitHub issues that were closed. You can find full details at:
https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/master/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.1.0.1-release-notes.txt
.

Note that there are also some important changes made to the GitHub repo
itself. Specifically, we have chosen to adopt a git workflow based on this
blog: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/91418889ff/dd7765f039>,
where all the new development work will be done on the 'develop' branch and
the 'master' branch will henceforth reflect the latest official ESAPI
release.

To accommodate this,

   - The 'develop' branch has now been made the DEFAULT branch.
   - The 'master' branch has now been made a PROTECTED branch.

Chris Schmidt will be uploading this to Maven sometime later this day,
probably once he's through with his day job. Lastly, a special shout-out to
Matt Seil and Jeremiah Stacey for their help with Git and some nasty JUnit
concurrency issues.


*ZAP User Survey*

Please help us to make @owasp ZAP even better for you by answering the ZAP
User Questionnaire:

*EVENTS: Upcoming AppSec Events*

<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/91418889ff/51bee3e7f2>

The European OWASP Conference is going to be one of the best ever.
Come to hear and share ideas with the experts!
27 June - 1 July 2016

Read the latest news on the next *OWASP AppSecEU* on the conference site:
http://2016.appsec.eu/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/91418889ff/097d656140>

Important keynote speakers will be present at the Marriott Park Hotel in
Rome, Italy. Our special guest will be Charlie Miller, who will present the
keynote talk "Bugs ruin everything". In his speech, Miller will discuss
some popular methods for finding vulnerabilities and why it is so difficult
to spot them.

*Charlie Miller is a senior security engineer at Uber ATC, a hacker, and a
gentleman.* Back when he still had time to research, he was the first with
a public remote exploit for both the iPhone and the G1 Android phone. He is
a four-time winner of the CanSecWest Pwn2Own competition. He has authored
three information security books and holds a PhD from the University of
Notre Dame. He has hacked browsers, phones, cars, and batteries.

The *Open Web Application Security Project* is an open-source project for
application security. OWASP provides advice on the creation of secure
Internet applications and testing guides.

It boasts a strong global community with more than 45,000 participants,
more than 55 corporate members and 20 academic supporters through 249
active local chapters in 6 continents and 97 countries.

More than 800 people are expected at the event, with 3 days of training
followed by the 2-day conference that includes:

   - Five parallel talks with focus on the OWASP core mission (Dev, Ops,
   Hack, CISO and Research);
   - Keynotes from industry leaders;
   - Exhibition spaces that offer innovative solutions for the needs of
   companies.

Do not miss the opportunity to participate this important conference,
mentioned in Tripwire as a TOP 11 SECURITY CONFERENCE IN 2016
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/91418889ff/d971013ace>
.

More details on registration, program and speakers will be sent in a
forthcoming communication.

Hi, all -

Quick question about the mailing list:  I've had a couple of recruiters
email me regarding posting jobs to the mailing list.  I'm willing to
forward them along, as long as they're local (or telecommute) and AppSec
focused jobs, but I want to make sure that's something people -want- to see
on the mailing list.  Opinions?

My opinion is this is not the purpose that the OWASP-KC mailing list is
intended. The OWASP-KC mailing list is intended for communication regarding
the chapter, OWASP, etc business communication and should not be used for
job postings.

However, providing a separated mailing list for job postings provides a
place where this type of communication can be done. Interested individuals
can join the 'job postings' mailing list and authorized/approved recruiters
can post there. Then individuals not interested aren't having to wade
through undesired emails.

Thanks for the feedback, all.  Since I've gotten about a 50/50 response so
far, I'm going to err on the side of caution, and -not- forward these along
to the list.  I think what I will do instead is post them to the LinkedIn
group on the Jobs page - you know we have a LinkedIn group, right?  :-)
 It's at https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8463040/jobs ...  This way we can
keep all of the recruiter spam in one place, and if you're looking, you can
look there, and if you're not looking, you can pretend it's not there.
 (But I still encourage you to join the group!)

Thanks for the feedback, all!  As always, please let me know if you have
any concerns or comments!

Happy Saturday Night, everyone!

Just a friendly reminder that this Tuesday at 6:30pm is the February 2016
OWASP-KC Chapter Meeting!  We'll be meeting at the same location as last
time, the Kauffman Foundation Conference Center, in the Brookside room.

We don't have a guest speaker this month (though I do already have March's
speaker lined up!), but I'm putting together a presentation that I think
will be a lot of fun, and am really looking forward to presenting it.

If you haven't already registered at the Eventbrite, we'd appreciate it if
you did, just so we know how many to expect!

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-kc-february-2016-tickets-21442138012

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

is #10

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration
testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is
designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and
as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to
penetration testing. ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of
tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.

OWASP OWTF is a project focused on penetration testing efficiency and
alignment of security tests to security standards like: The OWASP Testing
Guide (v3 and v4), the OWASP Top 10, PTES and NIST.

#2 of our 2016 Strategic Goals
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/91418889ff/ec52f470ae/utm_content=&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=%232%20of%20our%202016%20Strategic%20Goals&utm_campaign=OWASP%20Foundation%20%7C%20February%202016%20Connector>
is to become more involved in the Developer community. We are pleased to
report tremendous turnout for our recent outreach events, Codemash in
chilly Ohio and AppSec California in sunny Santa Monica.

CodeMash
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/91418889ff/70123d48f3>
is a unique event that seeks to educate developers on current practices,
methodologies, and technology trends in a variety of platforms and
development languages such as Java, .NET, Ruby, Python and PHP.

A breakdown of this tremendous event:

   - 2500 attendees
   - 1000 kids
   - 202 speakers
   - 84 staff
   - 280 sessions

Sessions included 40 hours of security content, with 2 days of training by
Jim Manico and Bill Sempf.

OWASP Foundation participated as a Gold level sponsor. Bill Sempf, the
project leader of the OWASP .NET Project and chapter leader for OWASP
Columbus, served on the Session Committee helping to review over 1000
submissions. We have been proud to partner with Codemash over the past two
years and are seeking similar opportunities worldwide.

AppSec California
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/91418889ff/75715dbf94>
is a one of a kind experience for information security professionals,
developers, and QA and testing professionals, as they gather at the beach
from around the world to learn and share knowledge and experiences about
secure systems and secure development methodologies. The third annual event
taking place last month fulfilled all expectations bridging the local
application security and developer communities for a beautiful weekend on
the California coast.

*OWASP ZSC Project*

OWASP ZSC is an open source software in python language which lets you
generate customized shellcodes and convert scripts to an obfuscated script.
Shellcodes are small codes in assembly which could be use as the payload in
software exploiting. Other usages are in malwares, bypassing anti viruses,
obfuscated codes and etc. Obfuscate codes can be use for bypassing
antiviruses, code protections, same stuff, etc. This software can be run on
Windows/Linux/OSX under python.

Why use OWASP ZSC?
According to other shellcode generators such as metasploit tools and etc,
OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect.
OWASP ZSC encoders are able to generate shellcodes with random encodes that
lets you to get thousands of new dynamic shellcodes with the same job in
just a second, it means you will not get a same code if you use random
encodes with same commands, and that makes OWASP ZSC one of the bests!
otherwise it's going to generate shellcodes for other operation systems in
the next versions. It?s the same story for the code obfuscation.

Notable
Chapter Activity

OWASP New Zealand and the University of Aukland presented its seventh
annual OWASP New Zealand Day
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/91418889ff/f33210ae43/utm_content=&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=OWASP%20New%20Zealand%20Day&utm_campaign=OWASP%20Foundation%20%7C%20February%202016%20Connector>
on February 4. The OWASP New Zealand Day conference is a free, one-day
event dedicated to application security, with an emphasis on secure
architecture and development techniques to help Kiwi developers build more
secure applications. The conference was preceded by a training event on
February 3. Slide decks are posted to the 2016 OWASP New Zealand Day website
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/91418889ff/625712263d/utm_content=&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=the%202016%20OWASP%20New%20Zealand%20Day%20website&utm_campaign=OWASP%20Foundation%20%7C%20February%202016%20Connector>.

Good Morning, OWASPers!

This is the evite to the Interface mini-conference that I mentioned at the
meeting the other day - the conference is free for OWASP members to attend,
just register at the evite page.  (I can't guarantee they won't spam you.)
   I don't know a ton about this event, but it's an opportunity to earn
some CPE credits, if nothing else!  I'll be there passing out OWASP
information, I'd also love to have some extra manpower for that if someone
is willing to help out!

-----------------------

http://www.interfacetour.com/evites/kcm/owasp-kcm.htm


Registration is now open. Feel free to email this to your members. It is
free to attend and each guest can earn up to 6 CPE credits during the day.

I had some good discussion last night with a few peers around new defense contractor regulations for unclassified data protection. From my very brief review, it seems like there are significant implications on app security, data exchange, and timeline. Not sure if that touches anyone else in this group, but thought I would throw out the topic.?

Should probably include some contact info if anyone wants to meet up at RSA.
