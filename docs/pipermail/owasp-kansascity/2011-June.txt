Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] call for volunteers to represent OWASP at KCDC
	June 25
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=wn8WkV1k6kSsR+OFJf0kGgTRKrg@mail.gmail.com>

Call for volunteers:

The Kansas City OWASP chapter so far has three volunteers: myself, Chris
Flowers, Steve Jensen, who will represent the chapter at the upcoming K.C.
Developer Conference.

The Kansas City Developer's Conference (KCDC) is a one-day conference with
hour-long instructional sessions geared toward software developers. The
event definitely has a slant toward Microsoft technologies, but we will
include content about anything that is of interest to software developers,
and their managers. This year's event is being held on Saturday June 25th,
2011 at Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, KS.

   http://kcdc.info/

If you are an OWASP member and would like to volunteer to help staff the
booth on behalf of the chapter, please give me a call.

Thank you,



Mat Caughron
KC OWASP volunteer chapter lead

All,

We hope you'll be able to join us in Minneapolis to celebrate the 10th year
of OWASP at AppSec USA.  

 

YOUR LIFE IS IN THE CLOUD

 

Are you afraid to look at your mobile apps and cloud deployments for fear of
what you'll find? It's been a tough year in security, and mobility and cloud
computing are placing a serious strain on already overburdened software
development and security departments.

  

Get over your fears, and avoid becoming yet another entry in the breach log.
Send your developers and security team to OWASP AppSec USA 2011, Minneapolis
Convention Center this September 20-23!  

 

Training at AppSec

 

Sign up for mobile security, penetration testing, secure coding, and attack
detection and response courses being held September 20-21. Group discounts
are available.
