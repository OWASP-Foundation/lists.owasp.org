Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] December 2010 Kansas City - OWASP Chapter update
Message-ID: <AANLkTikO4-c_AYRncRTA4SADe5KGU6YhBOQ_LJvq9j5k@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings OWASP Midwest :

There has never been a better time to be working in software security.  As
you know from your own careers, the discipline keeps you relevant.

OK.

My wife gave birth to a healthy baby boy a couple weeks ago and that has
made the household a little busier than usual, so unless we have another
volunteer organizer, the next meeting will not be December as originally
hoped, but will take place in Feb.2011.

A quick year-end summary for what happened in 2010 at the Kansas City OWASP
chapter:

   - October 2010 - Dustin Anders from Imperva spoke on
   WebApplictionFirewalls
   - August 2010 - Steve Jensen, BT Global Services spoke on mobile security
   - June 2010 - James Connolly covered the enterprise risk context of
   webappsec
   - April 2010 - two speakers from Veracode presented on backdoors and
   malicious code detection
   - February 2010 -  Steve and Ray from PhoneFactor covered their
   fascinating protocol-level vuln in SSL

In addition, the chapter made progress in attracting a number of first-time
attendees.

Slides from these presentations continue to serve as useful resources and
are available on the KC-OWASP web site at:
 http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City

We still have some OWASP pens and a few T-shirts to give away at upcoming
meetings.

We have ambitious plans for OWASP-Kansas City in 2011.  These include a
joint meeting (if possible, still unconfirmed) with our ISACA chapter.
Vendors we will be inviting to bring their presenters to the chapter
include: F5, HP, Symantec, SecurityPS, Microsoft, Oracle, FishNet, Coverity,
Klokwork, and more, so stay tuned...

Happy Holidays everyone,
