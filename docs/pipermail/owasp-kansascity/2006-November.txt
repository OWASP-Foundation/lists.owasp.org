Hi everyone,

I recently took the OWASP chapter leadership role here in KC from Arian Evans.  At this time I'd like
to announce that we have a time and place for our next chapter meeting!  The agenda has yet to be
determined, but with so many great appsec people in KC, I have no doubt it will be a great meeting.
Please let me know if you would like to present or discuss a particular topic so I can get it on the
agenda.

Here are the details:

When:  Wednesday, December 6, 2006 from 6:30 to 8:30 pm

Where:
American Century Investments 
4520 Main Street, Tower II (South Tower) 
Room 2A

Parking: Surface lot on the south side of Tower II.
Everyone will need to check in with security at the desk.

That's all for now.  I hope you can attend.  BTW, thank you Barry Archer and American Century for
providing the facilities.
