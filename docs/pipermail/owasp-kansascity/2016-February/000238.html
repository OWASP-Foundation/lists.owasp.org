<PRE>Happy Monday, everyone!

The February 2016 OWASP-KC meeting will be held on February 23rd, 2016, in
the Brookside room at the Kauffman Foundation Conference Center (same place
as last time, different room).

We don't have an outside speaker for this meeting (unless someone steps up
at the last minute), but I'm putting together a fun and interesting
presentation that I think will prove interesting for everyone.

February Meeting of the Open Web Application Security Project - Kansas City
Chapter.

This month's meeting will not have a featured speaker - instead Justin
Ferguson (volunteer chapter leader) will be presenting some real-world
Application Security case studies.   We will go in-depth with several
recently-published Application Security vulnerabilities, to show how
inattention to AppSec can have real-world consequences (or maybe just help
a hacker get a free lunch).  If you're trying to make a case for an AppSec
program in your workplace, this presentation might just give you some
ideas.  If you're an InfoSec guy trying to explain to your developers what
this AppSec thing is all about, bring them along!

Our OWASP Project Spotlight this month will be on the OWASP Zap Proxy,
which is a valuable tool for discovering some of the vulnerabilities we'll
be talking about as well.

We'll also try to devote part of our meeting time to general
discussion/networking.

As always, it's not required that you reserve a ticket (and definitely not
required that you use your real name), but it is appreciated so we can make
sure we have space for everyone.

Reserve your ticket at

Hope to see you all there - as always, please email with any questions,
concerns, or opinions!
