Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] call for presenters
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVUtBtUi--N7+juKf5=H2K_oG_-Ckz5O_Gs6BbNQugUBtg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings:

We're now beginning to plan OWASP-KC events for the summer.

This email is a call for meeting speaker-presenters for chapter
meetings in the months ahead.

Previous presenters have hailed from: FishNet, PhoneFactor
pre-Microsoft-acquisition, Veracode, F5, Fortify, Imperva among many
others, although no affiliation is required.   In fact, we'd really
love to hear from any KC area security hackers who'd like present on a
topic of general interest.

So, if you are a hacker looking to showcase your talent, a security
company looking to advise the general public on the goods your company
can provide, or a consultant who's been there and done that, we'd like
to have you on board to help us build our chapter meetings.  Email me
directly or reply to the list for full consideration and a discussion
about best time to schedule.

Cheers,


Mat Caughron
KC-OWASP volunteer chapter leader

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] updated wiki: Kansas City June 2013 Meeting
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVWegVGJB9Z04jSXS99EYuM7ZS_F60uRrJP8fN9hYfsmJQ@mail.gmail.com>

The chapter wiki page has been updated for the June 20 meeting with
the following information:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City_June_2013_Meeting


Topic:
"Adding Risk Analysis and KPI Reporting to Your WebApp/Vuln Scanning"

Discovering your enterprise vulnerabilities has become much easier
with scanning tools. However, many organizations still struggle with
handling the vulnerabilities that have been identified. Which ones
should we fix first, and which ones can we ignore? Who should be
responsible for the remediation task, and how can we hold them
accountable? These questions and others common struggles for
organizations large and not-so-large. In this presentation, we will
look at:
Methods to consolidate and de-duplicate scanning results from leading
security tools,
Automatically correlate results with assets, incidents, controls,
policies, and other compliance/security data,
Conduct risk scoring of each vulnerability and calculate
inherent/residual risk scores for the vulnerability, asset, system,
facility, and other records,
Assign remediation workflow for vulnerabilities and hold owners accountable,
Correlate scanning results with industry feeds such as US-CERT's NVD
and iDefense,
Report on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as workflow
performance, trends per webapp/platform/Business Unit/Facility, and
other categories.

Speaker Bio:
 Larry Slobodzian is a Senior Solution Engineer at LockPath and an
Adjunct Professor of Information Systems at Baker University. With
over 16 years of networking, compliance, and security experience,
