<PRE>Hello,

Since our last chapter meeting in September the KC OWASP chapter has
grown by another dozen people.  Welcome to the new members!  If you
enjoy our chapter, keep spreading the word.

I am pleased to announce that the details for our next OWASP Kansas City
chapter meeting have been finalized.  We will get together on Wednesday,
November 7th starting at 6:00 PM and finishing around 7:30 PM..  Add the
event to your calendar today so you don't miss this opportunity to learn
about web application security and network with your peers.
 
Here is the presentation planned for this meeting:

Speaker: Tom Stripling, CISSP on The Dangers of Third-Party Content

It is now commonplace for web applications to include content from other
sites, partners, and advertisers.  If this content isn't handled
correctly, applications are left vulnerable to attack.  By examining a
variety of attacks that can be executed through third-party content, we
can better evaluate application risk and design countermeasures.

Session Learning Objectives
* Determine the threat posed by third-party content, given trends in
Internet content and specific risks associated with each form of
third-party content inclusion
* Demonstrate attacks against a live web application that exploit flawed
security assumptions in the inclusion of third-party content
* Analyze the effectiveness of various application security
countermeasures to combat the threat
* Enable developers and penetration testers to better identify and
prevent the risks associated with the use of third-party content in web
applications

Tom Stripling is a senior application security consultant with an
extensive background in web application development, penetration
testing, and risk assessment. In his role at Security PS, he helps
clients uncover application vulnerabilities and secure the software
development process. In his spare time, Tom is an avid researcher of
application security attacks, vulnerabilities, and best practices.


** We have time for another person to give a brief 15-45 minute
presentation on web application security.  This can be a technical
demonstration, conference review, or open discussion about a web
application security topic.  Please let me know if you'd like to grab
this spot.
