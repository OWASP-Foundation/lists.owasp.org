Dear OWASP friends,

AppSec US 2010, the premiere OWASP conference in the US, is less than
2 months away. We have published training schedule and conference
agenda (http://appsecUSA.org/agenda <http://appsecusa.org/agenda>). At this
point, I would like to
ask your help to help promote the event -- to your friends, family
members, colleagues, bosses, other IT organizations, etc.

We are designating July 19-25 as AppSec TweetWeek and please promote
the conference on Twitter, and your other favorite social media. Here
are a few things you can do.

* Follow @appsec2010 (http://twitter.com/appsec2010).
* Tag your tweets/updates with #appsec2010
* Retweet @appsec2010
* Tweet about the schedule, keynote, training, classes
* Tweet about what to do in Southern Cal.

If you have a blog, please blog about the conference.

If you would like to volunteer for the conference, please let Neil
Matatall (neil at owasp.org) know.

Thank you very much for your help and we hope to see many of you in
Southern California in September!
