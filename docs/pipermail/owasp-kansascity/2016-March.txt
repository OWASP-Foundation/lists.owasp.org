Open Web Application Security Project
*Kansas City Chapter*
*March 2016 Meeting*


Our speaker this month will be Cory Kennedy:


*Cory Kennedy is one of the Founders of SecKC, a nonprofit focused on
helping Kansas City's information security community. He has spoken on
topics of Threat Intelligence, Android reverse engineering, Penetration
testing and how to manage your malware for many 3 letter organizations. He
is a Lead member of the Cyber Threat Intelligence program at CTL. For more
than 10 years, Cory has applied his computer security passion to everything
from the information security community to reverse engineering and Red and
Blue teams.*

Talk: Open Source Threat Intelligence Management

*What is threat intelligence? Many of us understand what "it" is, but
managing it is an entirely different ballgame. In this talk I will show you
how to truly understand how to convert threat information into threat
intelligence with FOSS. I promise that every other word will be "Cyber" and
you will leave with the tools to build a program from scratch and add
structure to an existing program. We will talk about the importance of
development staff as well as show real world examples of how managing
threat intelligence can bring real value to your organization.*
