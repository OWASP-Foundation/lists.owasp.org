Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] OWASP chapter meeting reminder,
 LockPath to present on dealing with scanning tool results
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVWPZgNsEuo9tjVjX3AAUMT9NUmrpOhVsp+EMvw4BD6-Pw@mail.gmail.com>

Sean White and Justin Ferguson will be leading the meeting today, which
starts at 6:30 PM.


*Meeting Topic:* Adding Risk Analysis and KPI Reporting to Your WebApp/Vuln
Scanning

*
*

*Location: (confirmed)* Johnson County Community College
Regnier Center Room 344.


Discovering your enterprise vulnerabilities has become much easier with
scanning tools. However, many organizations still struggle with handling
the vulnerabilities that have been identified. Which ones should we fix
first, and which ones can we ignore? Who should be responsible for the
remediation task, and how can we hold them accountable? These questions and
others common struggles for organizations large and not-so-large. In this
presentation, we will look at:
Methods to consolidate and de-duplicate scanning results from leading
security tools,
Automatically correlate results with assets, incidents, controls, policies,
and other compliance/security data,
Conduct risk scoring of each vulnerability and calculate inherent/residual
risk scores for the vulnerability, asset, system, facility, and other
records,
Assign remediation workflow for vulnerabilities and hold owners
accountable,
Correlate scanning results with industry feeds such as US-CERT's NVD and
iDefense,
Report on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as workflow performance,
trends per webapp/platform/Business Unit/Facility, and other categories.
