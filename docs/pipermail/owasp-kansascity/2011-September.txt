Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] policy re: job postings in the greater Kansas
	City area
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVUj83evqCNoeW8fqjYwsbs-4d357X4HS-djseifc7Ctbw@mail.gmail.com>

 All:

For Kansas City area employers to post job listings to this Kansas City
chapter mailing list, we will follow these guidelines from one of our
international chapters:
   1. job description specifically involves appsec (information assurance /
software security) skills
   2. local Kansas/Missouri area postings
   3. no recruiters at this time, only direct postings from the hiring
company
   4. let's keep mailing list traffic to a minimum, reduce multiple-postings

Ofer Maor from the OWASP Israeli chapter provides the following guidance
which we seek to follow:
**
*My take here, which has been proven as working wonderfully on the OWASP*
*Israel list (with over 700 subscribers) is to allow job listings on the*
*list. We have a very clear policy on what we allow or disallow in that*
*respect, but we definitely think that our community which consists of many*
*appsec specialists, wants to hear about such job openings.*
* *
*Our policy is quite simple. We allow posting of jobs that require appsec*
*skills (i.e. if you're an AppSec vendor looking for a system admin - no.
but*
*if u'r looking for an application pentester, then by all means do).*
*Naturally the job has to be here (i.e. Israel) - you cannot use the list to
*
*post just jobs anywhere around the globe. You can post each job to the list
*
*one time. If you have several open positions - you should merge them into*
*one mail. We don't have a clear policy on the frequency of separate mails,*
*we play it by ear, but we never had yet an abuse problem with it.*
* *
*Also - should you submit a job, it should have full details about the*
*company and position - it's not a place for headhunters and recruiters who*
*hide the employer. We also encourage the submitters to be the relevant*
*professional person, and not turn this into some HR arena.*
* *
*Bottom line - this works for us. We get jobs posted by people from our own*
*community, who are looking for other appsec specialists in their*
*organizations. There is no abuse here, and it provides value for our*
*members.*

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] Apache denial of service mitigation
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVVzmKVUz26dX79==Ran3ssDM65uuiOR9yGudstDkqLJSw@mail.gmail.com>

As the apache-kill script has been an ongoing topic of conversation for the
past few weeks, here for your convenience is a piece on mitigation:



https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/16131-Mitigating-the-Apache-Range-Header-DoS-Vulnerability.html


Fortunately, there are some Apache configuration settings that can be
adjusted to mitigate this vulnerability:

   - Use mod_headers to completely disallow the use of Range headers.  For
   example, in your httpd.conf file add the lines:

*RequestHeader unset Range *

*RequestHeader unset Request-Range*

Note that this may impact certain clients, particularly if a web server is
used for serving content to e-Readers or providing streaming video. However,
this should be safe for most websites that are not serving this type of
content.

   - Limit the size of the request field to a only few hundred bytes.  For
   example, in your httpd.conf file add the line:

*LimitRequestFieldSize 200*

While this will keep the offending Range header short, it may break other
headers such as a large cookie or security fields header settings.  Also, as
the attack evolves you may have to further limit this or impose other
LimitRequestFields settings.

   - Configure Apache to detect a large number of ranges in the request
   header and then either ignore the header or reject the request. For example,
   add the following lines to your httpd.conf file:

*SetEnvIf Range (,.*?){5,} bad-range=1 RequestHeader unset Range
env=bad-range*

The value 5 is arbitrary and may need to be made larger depending on the
type of content your site serves. For example, the value may need to be
increased to 10 for sites that serve PDFs to eReaders for example, or that
serve other types of large files such as video.

   - Finally, if you are using mod_security you can use the below rule to
   detect and block the attack. Thanks to SpiderLabs
<http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2011/08/mitigation-of-apache-range-header-dos-attack.html>for
   this bit of code.

*SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:Range
?^bytes=(\d+)?\-(\d+)?\,\s?(\d+)?\-(\d+)?\,\s?(\d+)?\-(\d+)?\,\s?(\d+)?\-(\d+)?\,\s?(\d+)?\-(\d+)?\,?
\ ?phase:2,capture,rev:?2.2.1?,t:none,block,msg:?Range: Too many
fields?,logdata:?%{matched_var}?severity:?5?,id:?958231?,tag:?RULE_MATURITY/5?,tag:?RULE_ACCURACY/7?,tag:?
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ModSecurity_CRS_RuleID-%{tx.id}
?,tag:?PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/INVALID_HREQ?,tag:?
http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us/documentation/how-it-works/
?,setvar:?tx.msg=%{rule.msg}?,setvar:tx.id=%{rule.id
},setvar:tx.anomaly_score=+%{tx.notice_anomaly_score},setvar:tx.protocol_violation_score=+%{tx.notice_anomaly_score},setvar:tx.%{
rule.id}-PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/INVALID_HREQ-%{matched_var_name}=%{matched_var}?
*

I believe that most sites could easily implement the first option (denying
Range headers altogether) without any negative impact to site viewers.

Presentation Title: SQL Injection and XSS: How to and How to prevent

SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) are frequently listed as
the two top web site vulnerabilities being exploited by hackers. In
this session you will learn exactly what these exploits are, see how
hackers use tools to automate this hacking, and most importantly,
learn the steps you can take to minimize the risk of falling victim to
