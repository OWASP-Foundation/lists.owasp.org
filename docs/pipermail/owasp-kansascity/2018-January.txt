Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] the role of appsec in Spectre and Meltdown
 response, request for chapter meeting
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVWwfdsCKLsGXEW543U6shaNeP2GsOYiEMKUbb_QYLB6qg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings KC OWASP chapter:

Google's Site Isolation
<https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation> and
presumably similar patches in Apple's Safari later this month will reduce
the likelihood of using the browser as an attack vector.  However, the fact
that browser level patches are being rolled out indicates that at this
time, browser-based languages such as javascript are a potential means of
exploit for these pervasive flaws.

Due to browser involvement, the OWASP community i.e.software security
community, have a distinct role to play in this response, both in terms of
increasing awareness and advisement around mitigations and potential
technical and non-technical responses to the issues raised.

Can we set up a meeting this month or next month wherein we can assemble to
discuss technical briefings and mitigation strategies?  The Kaufman Center
seems like an ideal place to hold such a meeting and it would be good to
make requests of Kansas City's infosec community leaders to attend and
contribute where possible.


CERT has a summary:  http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/584653


*Meltdown:*   https://meltdownattack.com
Every Intel processor which implements out-of-order execution is
potentially affected, which is effectively every processor since 1995
(except Intel Itanium and Intel Atom before 2013)

Linux mitigation is KAISER / KPTI for the kernel.
Vendor patches for OSX and Windows versions are underway or already
delivered.


*Spectre:*    https://spectreattack.com
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753

Mitigations are complex.


What a way to begin 2018!  We have yet another year of solid infosec
challenges ahead of us.

Looking forward to seeing all of you some time soon,

I would be interested.

There was discussion last October about putting together an SecureDLC
exercise with the KC group following by the holiday hiatus.

Had not heard from yet Justin regarding this January.

Hey, all - I truly apologize for being rather incommunicado for a while;
had a lot going on the last couple months of the year and OWASP was just a
thing that had to drop off the radar.  I am definitely trying to get things
back up and running this year, and am simply working through some date
challenges at the moment.  Have been messaging with Mat about dates a
little; will hopefully get something lined up soon.   If anyone is
interested in participating in a Spectre/Meltdown round table at the first
meeting, please let me and Mat know - I think it's an excellent topic.

This is going to happen on January 29th at 6pm at the Kauffman Foundation
Conference Center - the usual meeting date in January won't work for
various reasons, so we're doing it on an off day.  Expect an official
announcement in the near future.

Hey, all - It's alive!  We're having a meeting in January!  It's not on the
usual day, but it's a meeting, and should be a good one!

--------------
Meeting Date - Monday, january 29th, 2018 - 6:00-8:30PM
Kauffman foundation conference center
4801 Rockhill road, Kansas city, mo

DESCRIPTION

The recently released MELTDOWN and SPECTRE vulnerabilities have been yet
another security earthquake in the computing world. We believe that the
software security community has a distinct role to play in regards to these
issues, in terms of increasing awareness and advisement around mitigations
and potential responses, both technical and non-technical.

We will be holding a panel discussion about the MELTDOWN and SPECTRE
vulnerabiltiies. We will be discussing multiple aspects of the
vulnerabilities, the response to them, and the impact of these and future
vulnerabilities to the future of computing.

Panel Members (subject to change):

   -

   Michael Owens - Principal Cyber Security Architect - SAIC
   -

   John-Mark Gurney - Principal Security Architect - New Context Services -
   FreeBSD Developer
   -

   TBA - Optiv Security
   -

   TBA - Fishtech

an interesting event - we've got some great (and opinionated) security
folks to talk about SPECTRE and MELTDOWN!  Looking forward to seeing
everyone there!

Meeting info is here!

KC-OWASP,

I got called out of state for work so can't make it to today's panel.

WSJ news from today that Intel disclosed Spectre and Meltdown to the
Chinese before Americans is very sobering, well, maybe more like
infuriating:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-warned-chinese-companies-of-chip-flaws-before-u-s-government-1517157430

Advanced knowledge of this flaw would enable attackers to effectively
bypass many many cloud and device controls and China has the resources to
do it.
Consider the dep history of Chinese presence at pwn2own in Canada as
evidence of capability.
Intel's in-you-face lack of disclosure aligned with national interests is a
shot heard round the world.  More interested in their global interests than
America first?  Let's see how that plays out.

Proposed format for today's panel discussion:

1. What do we know about how these flaws (similiarities and differences to
other chip-level timing attacks like rowhammer)
2. What mitigations are available from Intel, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and
others.  Do they work?  Which mitigations provide greater strength in
combination (browser+OS+container).
3. Devices affected: ARM?  x86?  see:
https://www.techarp.com/guides/complete-meltdown-spectre-cpu-list/
4. Finally, what is the expected impact to corporate IT, software
developers, and the industry as a whole?  And where do we go from here?

Cheers,


Mat
