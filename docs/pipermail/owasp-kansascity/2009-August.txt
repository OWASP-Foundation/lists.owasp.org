Hi Rohini,

I've just relocated to the Kansas City area (Topeka - my childhood
home) after 10 years in the Asia Pacific region and today I joined the
KC OWASP chapter so I thought I would introduce myself.

I am slightly (in)famous for my 2008 Summer of Code project, Securing
WebGoat using ModSecurity, which has managed to spark discussion on 5
different OWASP Podcasts (the Project News section here has the
details: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Securing_WebGoat_using_ModSecurity_Project)...
I think it's an interesting project and if you need a break during
your presentation on September 17, then I would be glad to discuss it
along with WebGoat.

I am also on the Global Membership Committee and it was a privilege to
attend the OWASP EU Summit in Portugal last November.

I look forward to meeting up with everybody on September 17. If there
is anything I can do to help, let me know.

Best regards,
Stephen
