<PRE>et al,

Since we have gotten several inquiries:

The initial plan was to have a joint launch with ISSA
and/or ISACA to help get exposure. ISACA chose not to
respond at all, and ISSA said they were interested. 

We are still waiting on ISSA to respond about a jointly
hosted meeting. The target date was February, which is
clearly not going to happen now.

If ISSA does not respond, we have had several organizations
offer to host our events including Microsoft, and we will
move forward for a March/April time-frame. Once a hard
date is set there will be several steps taken to get the word
out to the proper development communities, including the
OWASP portal and this list.

I would like to start this in March, but realistically I think
our first meeting won't be until April since I am on the road
from now until almost mid-April.

Thanks,

Arian
