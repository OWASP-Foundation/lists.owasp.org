<PRE>Greetings, all!&#160; After a hiatus in June, we're back on for July!&#160; (As always, apologies for the short notice - I was on vacation, and had unexpectedly limited internet access.)&#160; Unfortunately, our usual location is unavailable on the 4th Tuesday this month, so RiskIQ (my employer) has been so kind as to allow us to use their space.&#160; It's ... less convenient than the Kauffman Center location for some people ... but there will be pizza and drinks, so hopefully it will be worth going out of your way for.&#160;&#160;
Our speaker will be Mike Wyatt, Security Researcher and Manager of Product Operations at RiskIQ, who will be speaking about Investigating Internet Cybercrime.&#160; &#160;He will be showing us how some common malicious payloads can be used to detect malicious sites and scams.&#160;
RSVPs are requested, so we know how much pizza to order, but as always, not required!&#160;&#160;Share this event on Facebook
                    and Twitter
                    We hope you can make it.Best,OWASP-KC
