<PRE>Well, guess what everyone - we've ALREADY outgrown the space at the
Downtown Library, before we even had our first meeting of the year!  (Of
course, it wasn't a very big space.)

However, we now have what I -hope- will be a more permanent location.  The
Kauffman Foundation has given us permission to use space in their
conference center at 4801 Rockhill Road, KCMO - just east of the Plaza,
just south of the Nelson-Atkins Museum.  I think this will be a great,
relatively-central location that will help to make OWASP-KC as accessible
to everyone as possible.

I look forward to seeing everyone on January 26th.   Our speaker and topic
will be:

Arian Evans - VP Product Strategy - RiskIQ &lt;<A HREF="http://www.riskiq.net/">http://www.riskiq.net/</A>&gt;
The Rise of 3rd Party Code

How changes to the traditional SDLC security model enable dynamic attacks
like malvertising.

Come learn how and why attackers leverage Malvertising and why SDLC
security is useless in this aspect of Operational Application Security.

*Arian is a recognized expert in information and application security,
software development, systems architecture and financial services. He is
responsible for ensuring that RiskIQ enables organizations to accurately
visualize their external-facing IT footprint so they can detect and respond
to threats to their brand and customers. Previously Arian ran operations
and product strategy for WhiteHat Security and built the company's
world-renowned Threat Research Center. In addition to managing the global
application security practice for consulting firm FishNet Security, he has
worked on global security projects for the Center for Internet Security,
NIST, the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service.*

so
we have an idea how many people to expect!

Our goal for 2016 is to make OWASP-KC the place for Security-Minded
Developers and Developer-Minded InfoSec Professionals to come together and
see each others' side of the coin.  If you know someone in your workplace
or organization who you think fits those molds, please share this
announcement with them!

</I>&gt;<i> to try to make them convenient to as many people as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first meeting of the year will be January 26th, 2016, and is currently
</I>&gt;<i> scheduled for the downtown Kansas City Public Library, though the location
</I>&gt;<i> may change, depending on attendance.  (This will not be the recurring
</I>&gt;<i> location going forward, but was convenient for this month.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Arian Evans from RiskIQ will be speaking about malware, malvertising, and
</I>&gt;<i> the risk and impact of these problems on web applications.
