Hi!

As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account.
This means that I have full access to your account.

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks.
I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.

If you want to prevent this,
transfer the amount of $735 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1GdSHQ4aE7zUD8HDqVJDEwU9dxn3LfJLMK

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.
I give you 48 hours to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

Best regards!

Hi, all - Apologies for this spam getting through.  The OWASP lists have
been getting bombarded with a bunch of this stuff, and as a result there is
currently an effort to move the OWASP lists to Google Groups.  In the
interim, however, I have switched the list to be a moderated list, to keep
it from happening again.  Given the tiny amount of traffic on the list, I
suspect no one will notice.

Subject: [Owasp-KansasCity] Doctoral Research Study Participants Needed
Message-ID: <012201d4d5cf$513a7880$f3af6980$@owasp.org>

My name is Garrett Goggans, a doctoral student at Colorado Technical
University. I am in the process of doing a study on the strategies needed by
web application developers to adopt the security practices of a secure
software development lifecycle. 

To conduct this study, I need to interview 10 professionals who have
successfully integrated such security practices within a software
development lifecycle. I am currently 4 participants short and need to
finalize these interviews this weekend or the study will be cancelled. 

Understanding the importance of web application security, this
correspondence is to invite you to participate in the study offering up the
much needed guidance to successfully integrate a secure software development
lifecycle by answering the following 10 questions:



1.	What is your experience with adopting the security practices of a
secure software development lifecycle?
2.	What do you believe the advantages of adopting these security
practices to be?
3.	What do you believe the disadvantages of adopting these security
practices to be?
4.	What strategies did you have to change to adopt/integrate the
security practices successfully?
5.	What strategies were you able to keep in place to adopt/integrate
the security practices successfully?
6.	What challenges did you face during the adoption/integration?
7.	What were the non-technological resources needed to successfully do
the adoption/integration?
8.	What were the technological resources needed for a successful
integration/adoption?
9.	What advice would you give other web application developers who are
trying to adopt a secure software development lifecycle?
10.	What other items should be added to our discussion?

 

The discussion of these questions will last roughly an hour. In addition,
each participant must meet the following criteria in order to participate:



1.	Must currently work, or have worked, within an adoption and/or
integration of secure software development lifecycle giving them the ability
to speak intelligently on the topic.
2.	Must have been upper management or, at a minimum, a senior level
professional who had the authority to make integration decisions, or provide
input for decisions made, at the time of the integration.

 

Please note that I can ensure complete confidentiality and anonymity through
the guidelines that must be followed by the study. If you are interested in
participating in this study, please respond back to me to begin the next
steps of the process.

Thank you for your time.

Garrett Goggans
