- The HTTP parser can now set server personalities
- threshold.config support
- The experimental CUDA code now also works on x86_64
- IP address only rules for IPv6 are now supported as well
- Suricata can now write a pid file (pass --pidfile &lt;file&gt;)
- A fuzzer script was added to the code base
- Policy lookup for defrag module

Improvements

- Much better average and worstcase performance in the detection engine
- Memory footprint was reduced
- More validation at signature loading stage
- Libnet 1.1 is now optional
- Negated uricontent and http_cookie matching is now supported
- Lots of fixes of issues found by Valgrind's DRD, CLANG and Parfait.
- Threads are named now in &quot;top&quot; (Linux only atm).
- Unified1 file handling is improved

Bugs fixed

Several segmentation faults, upgrading is highly recommended.

See
<A HREF="https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/issues?fixed_version_id=6&amp;set_filter=1&amp;status_id=c">https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/issues?fixed_version_id=6&amp;set_filter=1&amp;status_id=c</A>

Known issues &amp; missing features

We have made significant progress towards reaching our first full
(non-beta) release of Suricata. &#160;Your feedback is always important to us
and we appreciate your time and effort. &#160;As always, we are doing our
best to make you aware of continuing development and items within the
engine that are not yet complete. &#160;With this in mind, please notice the
list we have included of known items we are working on.

- Using the http_cookie keyword seems to cause a match on all packets.
- Currently we dont' support the dce option for byte_test and byte_jump.
- Stream reassembly is currently only performed for app-layer code.
- Inconsistent time stamps in http log file due to handling &amp; updating
of the http state.
- DCE/RPC over udp is not currently supported.
- dce_stub_data does not respect relative modifiers.
- Engine does not work properly on big endian platforms.
- Time based stats are not calculated correctly.

See <A HREF="https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/issues">https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/issues</A>
for an up to date list and to report new issues.

Victor
