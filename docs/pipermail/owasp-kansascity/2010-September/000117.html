<PRE>:<i>Event Information
</I>The KC Infragard is hosting a two day cyber event pitting systems/security
professionals against each other in a live cyber battle on a simulated
commercial network.  Systems administrators will be responsible for managing
and protecting a &quot;commercial&quot; network from a live cyber attack, something
they may not see on their own networks.  Since the exercise is hosted on a
private managed network that is not connected to the internet, production
data and systems are not at any risk.

Not only will participants get a chance to test their knowledge and
preparedness for securing an operational environment while under a live
attack, they will also get the opportunity to see how other teams handled
similar circumstances.  This provides real world data and a solid
understanding of best practices that can be implemented in their own
organizations.  At the end of the exercise participants will know the
strengths and weaknesses of their people, processes, policies and
technologies.  This valuable exercise provides an outreach and education
opportunity for our community to take home a greater understanding on how
they should be protecting their own networks.

If you are interested in playing, there is still time to sign up, see more
information at <A HREF="http://www.cyber-raid.com.">http://www.cyber-raid.com.</A>
