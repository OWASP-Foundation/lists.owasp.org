Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] recap of the March meeting,
 save the date for next chapter meeting April 24
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVVNT7khkw6vpLm=Hp5Ht4ysNVZV=iN9rf6RC-RV8F02cA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings:

Twenty-five (25) attendees were present this past Thursday to hear Jake
Reynolds and his team explain just how far you can escalate beyond simple
blind sql injection.    Slides from the talk have been posted on the OWASP
wiki at:
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kansas_City_March_2014_Meeting

At long last, the chapter wiki has been updated with archives and upcoming
meeting information.

For this next meeting, we'll have Steve Jensen from Veracode presenting on
April 24.  His topic is: Toolkits for Reversing Mobile Applications.

Location to be announced.  If your company has facilities and would be
interested in hosting our chapter meeting, please drop me a note.

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] web application firewalls, how to choose one,
 and what features they should have
Message-ID: <CAFbr7nOz1b2hy6HA_h+mFeVkdO1V6E-3oGcTTc5Qp2OcVzM+VA@mail.gmail.com>

All:

This list came up in conversation about firewalls following our last OWASP
meeting, so posting it here for general convenience and awareness.

Have a great weekend everybody,


Mat



Web Application Firewall Selection Criteria

   - Protection Against OWASP Top Ten!
   - Very Few False Positives (i.e., should NEVER disallow an authorized
   request)
   - Strength of Default (Out of the Box) Defenses
   - Power and Ease of Learn Mode
   - Types of Vulnerabilities it can prevent.
   - Detects disclosure and unauthorized content in outbound reply
   messages, such as credit-card and Social Security numbers.
   - Both Positive and Negative Security model support.
   - Simplified and Intuitive User Interface.
   - Cluster mode support.
   - High Performance (milliseconds latency).
   - Complete Alerting, Forensics, Reporting capabilities.
   - Web Services\XML support.
   - Brute Force protection.
   - Ability to Active (block and log), Passive (log only) and bypass the
   web trafic.
   - Ability to keep individual users constrained to exactly what they have
   seen in the current session
   - Ability to be configured to prevent ANY specific problem (i.e.,
   Emergency Patches)
   - Form Factor: Software vs. Hardware (Hardware generally preferred)

Breakers
Focusing on matters relevant to penetration testers, researchers, and other
security professionals.
Defenders
Emphasizing operations issues affecting infrastructure security teams,
administrators, support, etc.
Policy and Legal
Addressing privacy, compliance, and legal issues affecting development and
security communities.
The secondary tracks are:

OWASP-specific
Status, recruiting, and awareness for OWASP projects; board panels;
leadership workshops; etc.
Hands-On Skills Lab
Introductory workshops designed to familiarize attendees with critical
tools (e.g., ?nmap 101?).
We invite all practitioners of application security and those who work or
interact with all facets of application security to submit presentations
including, but not limited to the following subject areas:

Secure development: secure coding, static analysis, application threat
modelling, web frameworks security, countermeasures, SDLC, DevOps, etc.
Mobile security: Development and/or testing devices and the mobile web
Cloud security: Offensive and defensive considerations for cloud-based web
applications
Infrastructure security: Database security, VoIP, hardware, identity
management
Penetration testing: Methodologies, tools, exploit development, evasion
techniques, OSINT, etc.
Emerging web technologies and associated security considerations
Incident response: Threat detection, triage, malware analysis, forensics,
rootkit detection
OWASP tools and projects in practice
Policy and legal: Legislation, privacy, regulations and compliance, C-level
considerations, etc.
