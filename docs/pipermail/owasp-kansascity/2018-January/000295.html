Hey, all - I truly apologize for being rather incommunicado for a while; had a lot going on the last couple months of the year and OWASP was just a thing that had to drop off the radar.  I am definitely trying to get things back up and running this year, and am simply working through some date challenges at the moment.  Have been messaging with Mat about dates a little; will hopefully get something lined up soon.   If anyone is interested in participating in a Spectre/Meltdown round table at the first meeting, please let me and Mat know - I think it's an excellent topic.

There was discussion last October about putting together an SecureDLC exercise with the KC group following by the holiday hiatus.

Had not heard from yet Justin regarding this January.

Greetings KC OWASP chapter:

Google's Site Isolation&lt;<A HREF="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation">https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation</A>&gt; and presumably similar patches in Apple's Safari later this month will reduce the likelihood of using the browser as an attack vector.  However, the fact that browser level patches are being rolled out indicates that at this time, browser-based languages such as javascript are a potential means of exploit for these pervasive flaws.

Due to browser involvement, the OWASP community i.e.software security community, have a distinct role to play in this response, both in terms of increasing awareness and advisement around mitigations and potential technical and non-technical responses to the issues raised.

Can we set up a meeting this month or next month wherein we can assemble to discuss technical briefings and mitigation strategies?  The Kaufman Center seems like an ideal place to hold such a meeting and it would be good to make requests of Kansas City's infosec community leaders to attend and contribute where possible.


CERT has a summary:  <A HREF="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/584653">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/584653</A>


Meltdown:   <A HREF="https://meltdownattack.com">https://meltdownattack.com</A>
Every Intel processor which implements out-of-order execution is potentially affected, which is effectively every processor since 1995 (except Intel Itanium and Intel Atom before 2013)

Linux mitigation is KAISER / KPTI for the kernel.
Vendor patches for OSX and Windows versions are underway or already delivered.


Spectre:    <A HREF="https://spectreattack.com">https://spectreattack.com</A>
<A HREF="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753</A>

Mitigations are complex.


What a way to begin 2018!  We have yet another year of solid infosec challenges ahead of us.

Looking forward to seeing all of you some time soon,
