<PRE>Greetings KC OWASP chapter:

Google's Site Isolation
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation">https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation</A>&gt; and
presumably similar patches in Apple's Safari later this month will reduce
the likelihood of using the browser as an attack vector.  However, the fact
that browser level patches are being rolled out indicates that at this
time, browser-based languages such as javascript are a potential means of
exploit for these pervasive flaws.

Due to browser involvement, the OWASP community i.e.software security
community, have a distinct role to play in this response, both in terms of
increasing awareness and advisement around mitigations and potential
technical and non-technical responses to the issues raised.

Can we set up a meeting this month or next month wherein we can assemble to
discuss technical briefings and mitigation strategies?  The Kaufman Center
seems like an ideal place to hold such a meeting and it would be good to
make requests of Kansas City's infosec community leaders to attend and
contribute where possible.


CERT has a summary:  <A HREF="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/584653">http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/584653</A>


*Meltdown:*   <A HREF="https://meltdownattack.com">https://meltdownattack.com</A>
Every Intel processor which implements out-of-order execution is
potentially affected, which is effectively every processor since 1995
(except Intel Itanium and Intel Atom before 2013)

Linux mitigation is KAISER / KPTI for the kernel.
Vendor patches for OSX and Windows versions are underway or already
delivered.


*Spectre:*    <A HREF="https://spectreattack.com">https://spectreattack.com</A>
<A HREF="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753</A>

Mitigations are complex.


What a way to begin 2018!  We have yet another year of solid infosec
challenges ahead of us.

Looking forward to seeing all of you some time soon,
