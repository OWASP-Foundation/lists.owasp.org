<PRE>Greetings Kansas City OWASP chapter:

This month we have extended the invitation to speak to Sergey Shekyan
from Qualys on the topic of Web Denial of Service, Attack and Defense.

Date: Thursday June 21st.  7PM
Location:  Regnier Center Room #344
Johnson County Community College
12345 College Boulevard
Overland Park, Kansas 66210

While developers and administrators are focused on maintaining
scalable and complex interactive systems, another aspect is being
overlooked: making sure systems can detect and handle slow application
layer DoS attacks that consume available resources, and force servers
to reject legitimate clients.
Sometimes considered exotic and rare, slow DoS attacks can easily
knock out an unprepared server, as they use legitimate data and almost
don't differ from real traffic. Slow DoS attacks are exploiting
protocol flaws, and the handling of such attacks should be applied
within the server configuration, rather than setting up perimeter
devices to intercept the traffic. Without such protection, slow DoS
attacks can bypass traditional counter-DDoS systems undetected, and
can harm anything from HTTP servers to streaming servers, cache, proxy
and WebSocket servers.
Sergey will present a tool that can help find bottlenecks and help
developers and administrators to either apply existing tweaks, or
continue researching the problem with more details available, without
being distracted by having to implement their own proof of concept
solutions to test their systems.

The goal of presentation is to:
-       share information about such attack vectors, demonstrate the
attacks over HTTP and WebSocket protocols against HTTP, WebSocket ,
proxy, cache, media streaming servers using new version of
slowhttptest
-       discuss how information produced by the tool could be used to
narrow the problem
-       present mitigation recommendations and techniques.

Sergey Shekyan is a Senior Software Engineer for Qualys, where he is
focused on development of the company&#8217;s on demand web application
scanning service. With more than 10 years of experience in software
design, development, testing and documentation, Sergey has contributed
key product enhancements and software modules to various companies.
Prior to Qualys, he designed and implemented a web-based system for
general aviation pilots. Sergey holds both Masters and BS Degrees in
Computer Engineering from the State Engineering University of Armenia.

Date: Thursday June 21st.  7PM
Location:  Regnier Center Room #344
Johnson County Community College
12345 College Boulevard
Overland Park, Kansas 66210

You are encouraged to forward this meeting invite and there is no cost
to attend.
