I just wanted to take a quick second to say Thank You! to all of you who
have become OWASP members over the past year, and listed the Kansas City
chapter as your home chapter!   We've added several new members in the past
year, which is awesome, and will help our chapter to do even more great
stuff in the next year!

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] Job Opening Details Mentioned at Last Chapter
	Meeting
Message-ID: <CAFSZWavW6iC0Lyubq8Dc3mnnGyABKRrty+CRRG0-9A9A9o-5PQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I seem to remember that someone had mentioned they had .NET openings at the
last month's chapter meeting. Does anyone remember who it was?

I met a gentleman last night that introduced himself as a software engineer
with a .NET skill set and is looking for work. He seemed nice enough while
we talked but I have no knowledge of him other than that.

Asked him to send his resume to me. Figured I could forward it on.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] passing along some OWASP top ten criticisms and
	unsolicited OAuth advice
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVUoDAs4WkYvYrA8RKmwwCOrazgncMh89C_N2RCmTx1raQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings KC OWASP Chapter:

Family obligations preclude my attendance this afternoon.

Given the topic, here is some food for thought on the OWASP top ten:
  https://sakurity.com/blog/2017/04/24/owasp.html

You will note that again A7 is the controversial one.

Aside from trolling OWASP followers, Egor from Sakurity has some solid
advice about OAuth here:
   https://sakurity.com/oauth
Could have been an OWASP cheat sheet, really.

Hope to see you next month!



Mat C.
