Greetings, all!  It's that time again - OWASP-Kansas City - November
edition is upon us!  It's our last meeting of the year, and we've got a
great speaker lined up!

*Anthony Grandle, Software Security Architect at the Federal Reserve* will
be speaking about *Threat Modeling*. Threat modeling is a methodology that
allows a development team to design security controls to mitigate
acknowledged threats before a line of code is written. Yes, it will help
save teams, and their organizations, the time and money associated with
rework due to security design flaws. The real benefit of this approach
though is the stronger defensive posture it produces through ?designing
security in? rather than bolting it on, after the fact. The goal of this
interactive talk is to help development teams better understand how to go
about seeing the application from the attackers? perspective. We?ll discuss
how threat modeling fits into a larger secure development life cycle, why
it?s important, how you can ?sell it? in your organization, and how to get
started.

*Anthony* is the Software Security Architect for the Federal Reserve
Software Security Group. He has 19 years? experience developing and
delivering technology solutions in a wide variety of roles including
software engineer, application architect, technical lead, consultant, agile
coach, technology manager, and software security specialist. Anthony is
CSSLP certified and holds a graduate certificate in Advanced Computer
Security from Stanford University. He is currently pursuing his master?s
degree in Security Engineering from Southern Methodist University.

As always, RSVPs are requested, but not required - hope to see everyone
there!
