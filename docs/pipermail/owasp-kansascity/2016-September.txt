Hi, all - September meeting announcement and RSVP will be coming out
shortly, but in the interim - I need someone to be the emcee, read the
intro slides, and introduce the speaker, because I can't make it on
Tuesday.  Drop me an email if you're willing to help out, please!

Happy Tuesday, all!  Only one week until the next OWASP-KC!

We have a great speaker lined up:

*Looking at the Big Picture: Demonstrating the Interconnectedness of
Software and IT Systems*

*As software developers we often have tunnel vision on our projects. A
security vulnerability is reported. We fix it and release a patch not
giving much thought on the effects to surrounding products and
infrastructure. Those security vulnerabilities can have ramifications for
IT system and your organization as a whole. *

*Jeff will demonstrate hacking into a network by exploiting vulnerable web
applications and IT configurations. The hacking scenario will have
parallels to vulnerabilities found in the real world and will demonstrate
the interconnectedness of software and IT systems. Software developers and
budding security enthusiasts will get a glimpse into how vulnerabilities in
software, like ones found on the OWASP top 10, can effect systems beyond
that single application.*

*Jeff Beard-Shouse* is a Cyber Security Evangelist with the company
Security Professional Services (Security PS).

As always, RSVPs are appreciated, but not required.  Hope to see you there!


Meeting will be at the usual location - the Kauffman Foundation Conference
Center, Troost Room.

Message-ID: <CAD6LLGhXY3q=rHSfM2NE+fQDhK2Gn9pYFe9MzLukt9w89MEvrw@mail.gmail.com>

Just a reminder to everyone that OWASP KC is tonight at 6:30!

We've got a great speaker lined up:

--------------------------
Jeff Beard-Shouse - Cyber Security Evangelist - Security PS

Looking at the Big Picture: Demonstrating the Interconnectedness of
Software and IT Systems

As software developers we often have tunnel vision on our projects. A
security vulnerability is reported. We fix it and release a patch not

Jeff will demonstrate hacking into a network by exploiting vulnerable web

the interconnectedness of software and IT systems. Software developers and
budding security enthusiasts will get a glimpse into how vulnerabilities in

that single application.
-----------------------

I won't be able to make it tonight, unfortunately, but Matt King will be
filling in for me as emcee for the evening!   Hope everyone is able to make
it!
