Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] New leader for the KC OWASP chapter
Message-ID: <498A13DC993C1D4CAC5675ABC6DDBCFD6640FA@spsdc1.securityps.local>

Hello,

As I'd mentioned in an email around a month ago I've been seeking a
replacement as leader of the OWASP KC chapter.  I'm glad to announce
that Rohini Sulatycki from VML has volunteered to take over this role.
She's been a long time OWASP chapter member and presenter, and I'm sure
she'll do a great job continuing to grow the web application security
community.

I have certainly appreciated the opportunity to be a part of the local
OWASP activities and will continue to participate as I can.  Thanks to
all of you who spoke or otherwise contributed during this time to make
my job a lot easier.  Hopefully everyone will continue to present,
suggest topics, host meetings and attend events to keep our chapter
going strong.

Enjoy your summer!
