<PRE>Good evening, KC OWASPers!

A few news and announcements items:

First - April Meeting is coming up in a little less than two weeks!  It
should be a good one - Josh White will be giving a presentation on SSL,
cipher-suites, and related web traffic encryption tech. I'm definitely
looking forward to seeing his presentation.

Second - A change!  For a couple of reasons, I've created a Meetup.com
group for OWASP-KC, and will be using that moving forward instead of
Eventbrite for RSVPs.  Our meetup page is here:

           <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Kansas-City/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Kansas-City/</A>

I'm hoping this will help to grow our group a little through connecting
with some other local groups, as well as making it somewhat easier for me
to post meetings, etc.  I understand some folks may be hesitant to sign up
for meetup.com - there is, as always, absolutely no requirement that you
RSVP to attend the meetings - if you don't want to sign up, just show up!
I will continue to post meetings on Twitter (@owaspkc), LinkedIn (
<A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8463040/">https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8463040/</A>) and to the OWASP-KansasCity
mailing list as well.

Third - BSidesKC is coming up April 20 and 21 - it's shaping up to be a
great conference.  If you haven't already got a ticket, you can use this
link to get a free admission!

<A HREF="https://bsideskc2018.busyconf.com/bookings/new?code=OWASPKC2018">https://bsideskc2018.busyconf.com/bookings/new?code=OWASPKC2018</A>

(Link valid for the first 20 admissions only.)

Fourth - INTERFACE KC will be July 12 - I don't know a ton about this
conference but if nothing else it's lunch and CPEs.  This link will get
free admission for OWASP KC members:

<A HREF="https://f2fevents.com/evite/kcm18-owasp-kansas-city/">https://f2fevents.com/evite/kcm18-owasp-kansas-city/</A>

Fifth, and finally - As always, if anyone has suggestions for a topic
they'd like to see covered in a meeting, or would like to give a talk at a
meeting, let me know!  We're always looking for great content, and I'm
always happy to track someone down to speak on a subject.

Thanks for supporting OWASP KC!

JF
