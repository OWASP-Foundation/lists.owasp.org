Hey, all - As mentioned previously at meetings, I'd love to have a person
or two available at KCDC this Thursday and Friday to evangelize about
OWASP-KC - mostly just handing out some things I'm going to get printed up
and encouraging people to attend our meetings.

I've created a signup sheet here:

http://www.signupgenius.com/go/4090C4FABAC2AABFD0-kcdevelopers

If you are able to swing an hour or two of manning tables either of those
days, please sign up - it'd be great to have some warm bodies there.

Hello, all - Just a friendly reminder that TODAY, June 20th, is the last
day of the OWASP Spring Membership Drive <http://tinyurl.com/6fugn6e>.
Anyone purchasing (or renewing) their membership during the membership
drive is entered for a chance to win a ticket to AppSec EU, a ticket to

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] OWASP-KC - June Meeting / INTERFACE
Message-ID: <CAD6LLGiC6AKt1441v4j-t=vMG_Ki8VOiaN_CpuCbGWSqs3Dytg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all - First off, apologies for the late announcement - things (as
usual) have been a bit crazy.

You are invited to the June meeting of the Kansas City Chapter of the Open
Web Application Security Project!

This month's speaker will be yours truly (Justin Ferguson) - I will be
giving an hour-long overview of the OWASP Top 10.  Many people have
mentioned wanting an entry-level discussion of application security for
developers - this is the meeting!

As usual, the meeting will be from 6:30 to 8:00pm at the Kauffman
Foundation Conference Center, just East of the Plaza.  Please RSVP if
possible
<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-kc-june-2016-tickets-26199132310?ref=etckt>
so we can provide an accurate count to the facility, but don't let a lack
of RSVP discourage you from attending!

If you are a developer, or have developers in your organization who you
believe might benefit from this, please forward the invite along.

Also, wanted to re-send the information about the INTERFACE-Kansas City
event - they are offering free admission for KC User Group members, OWASP
KC included - just sign up at the link below.

Looking forward to seeing everyone next Tuesday, and anyone who's at KCDC
tomorrow and Friday!
