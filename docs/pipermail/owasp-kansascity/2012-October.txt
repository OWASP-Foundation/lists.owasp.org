Hello,

I'm looking for application security career opportunities in the Kansas
City area. I'm interested in building a secure software development process
for a local company.  I may also be interested in consulting opportunities.
 If you are looking for an individual to fit that need, please take a look
at my Linked In Profile: http://www.linkedin.com/in/ncoblentz and email me
directly.

Thank you!

Nick,

I've actually been working on a post on this subject.  My goal is to help
put KC infosec people and companies in touch with eachother.  I went ahead
and added a few things and posted it.  I know it's far from perfect, so
additions, feedback, and/or edits are greatly appreciated!

Good luck with your search.

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] notes following the September OWASP meeting,
 save the date for next meeting Nov.14
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVU+=N=GEbZTuhqCdCVcKTC9Kc6KTVD_waQTj4PnJQ3qjw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings KC OWASP Chapter:

Seemed to be general consensus that the middle room of McCoy's Foundry
in Westport was a convenient spot to get together.
They can provide food and drink plus there is a large monitor for
presentations.  I'll confirm the November 14 meeting for the same
location with the restaurant.

As we discussed, Zap is included in main BackTrack distro

root at bt:~# apt-cache search owasp
owtf - An OWASP+PTES-focused try to unite great tools.
owasp-zap - An easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for
finding vulnerabilities in webapps.

Going to hold off on posting the Java plugin vulnerability slide deck
I put together because there is still a lot going on, and want to let
the dust settle before putting a slide deck on the topic into public
domain.

Best regards,
