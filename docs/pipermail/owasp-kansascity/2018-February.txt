Hi Owasp leaders, following the Working Sessions model used at the last OWASP
Summit 2017 <https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/> in London, Photobox Group
Security, working with OWASP London Chapter, is hosting a number of working
sessions to continue the great work done at the Summit and to
collaborate/share our knowledge in important Application Security topics.
See https://pbx-group-security.com/working-sessions/ for all details.

The first (of many) working sessions will happen on the 6th of
February (register
here
<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-working-session-tickets-42150953637>)
and will focus on the following topics:

   - *GDPR and Consent Tracking*  - As companies prepare for GDPR's May
   deadline, in addition to the questions and topics raised at the GDPR
   sessions in the Summit, one area that has multiple Application Security
   implications is *Consent and Consent Tracking (i.e. how to capture in a
   secure way the exact consents that users have provided).*
   - *Playbooks for incident response* - continuing the great work done at
   the Summit on Playbooks, this session will focus on Incident Response and
   how to improve the quality, speed and effectiveness of incident response
   teams (by using pre-defined playbooks and decision trees to guide actions,
   remediations and root cause analysis)
   - *SAMM* - Maturity Models can be highly effective in mapping the
   current Application Security landscape and in providing roadmaps for the
   future. Come and meet some of the SAMM project authors and lead
   contributors, in this working session which will focus on lessons learned
   from using SAMM in the real work, and in solutions for sharing anonymously
   SAMM data (in order to create industry wide metrics)
   - *GitHub Security *- Continuing the work done at the summit in reaching
   out to GitHub in order to work with them on improved solutions for
   Authentication and Authorisation of 3rd party services/integrations

Please join us on this event and share your ideas with the community :)

*FAQ:*

*What is the format of the Working Sessions?*
The Working Sessions are collaborative events where all attendees are
expected to collaborate and be an active participants in the sessions (it
is ok to just come and listen, but the idea is to share and contribute).

The topics of the Working Sessions are created by the participants and
always focus on real-world problems or areas of research that those
participants are passionate about. What makes the Working Sessions special
is the environment where real-word security professionals come together in
an open, collaborative, friendly and highly productive environment to work
on challenges that they are passionate about and are actively involved in

*How is this different from Conferences*
Conferences are one-to-many events, where Working Sessions are many-to-many
events. There are no 50 minutes presentations and the key objectives of the
working sessions are:

a) provide an understating on the problem at hand
b) define key objectives for what can be achieved in that Working Sessions
c) collaborate
d) create an deliverable and plan for next steps (and next Working Sessions
on this topic)

*When and where are they happening*

6:00 - 8:00pm
Photobox Group, Unit 7, Metal Box Factory,
30 Great Guildford Street, London SE1 0HS

Register here
<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-working-session-tickets-42150953637>

*How long do Working Session last*
2 hours onsite, but the idea is that the conversation and work continues
asynchronously (in Slack and others mediums)

*Is there any cost to attendNo tickets are free*

*Can I participate remotely*
Yes, we will be providing Google Hangouts (or equivalent) link. Join the
#working-sessions slack channel (on OWASP's Slack) for more details and
links on the day

*I can't make it to the session next week, will there be others?*
Yes, Photobox will be hosting a Working Working Session every two weeks (on
Tuesday). See full list here
https://pbx-group-security.com/working-sessions/

*What about topic 'xyz', can we have a Working Session focused on it?*
Absolutely, use the #working-sessions to talk about it (we will have a
dedicated website for working sessions soon)

*Can we host a Working Session on another location or Owasp Chapter?*
Of course, part of the objectives of this series of Working Sessions is to
create an operational and logistics model that can easily be replicated

Hey, all - I'm trying to spend some time on getting speakers for our
meetings for the remainder of the year, and want to put some questions out
there:

Are there specific topics you'd like to see us cover in an OWASP-KC
meeting?

Are there specific speakers you'd like to see?

How does everyone feel about remote via video speakers?

Hey, all - One of our members sent me the following question, and I thought
I'd put it to the list for conversation:

-----
I was just sent a link to this site by my boss. https://securitytxt.org/
I've never heard of this concept. Is this a legitimate process and if so,
how is it regarded in the security world?
-----

Opinions?

I?ve heard about it primarily on podcasts and sec conference talks from
researchers. Their take is that they were more likely to report problems if
that was present and/or bug bounties in place. Reduces their risk for
reporting, if it appears you want to know and have policies in place.

*Latest example of why you should stop using browser extensions*



*Critical Flaw in Grammarly Spell Checker Could Let Attackers Steal Your
Data * <https://thehackernews.com/2018/02/grammar-checking-software.html>(*February
5, 2018*)
Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a vulnerability in
the ?Grammarly? spell-checking extension for Chrome and Firefox. The
vulnerability affects approximately 22 million Grammarly users by exposing
authentication tokens to all websites that a user visits. A threat actor
could exploit this vulnerability could steal said authentication tokens
with a measly four lines of code, according to researchers.
*Recommendation:* Grammarly has since issued a patch for this
vulnerability, and updates are available for Chrome and Firefox browsers.
At the time of this writing, Grammarly states that does not appear that
anyone has been affected by this vulnerability. However, with Ormandy?s
proof-of-concept code for exploitation of this vulnerability publicly
available it is likely threat actors will attempt to use said code for
malicious purposes. Web browsers and extensions should always be kept
up-to-date with the latest security patches because as this story portrays,
exploitation code is often made available on open sources.
*Tags:* Vulnerability, Grammarly, Data theft



*Please tell people to stop allowing DNS traffic to pass thru their
firewall.  You should all be pointed to your internal DNS servers!!!*



*UDPOS ? Exfiltrating Credit Card Data via DNS *
<https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/udpos-exfiltrating-credit-card-data-dns>
(*February 8, 2018*)
A Point-of-Sale (POS) malware, dubbed ?UDPOS,? is being distributed by
threat actors by impersonating a service pack provided by ?LogMeln,?.
According to Forcepoint researchers one sample, of UDPOS, has been observed
in the wild, and there is evidence to suggesting it is being used. Evidence
consists of LogMeln file names and Command and Control (C2) URLs. If the
fake package is downloaded and the file named ?update.exe? is executed, the
content of the file is automatically launched with 7-Zip?s ?RunProgram?
feature. The malware then creates a new service to maintain persistence on
an affected system. UDPOS is designed to steal magnetic stripe data (Track
1 and Track 2) from debit and credit cards by scraping the memory of
running processes.
*Recommendation:* POS networks should carefully be monitored for unusual
activity, thus keeping logs of what typical network activity looks like is
very important. In the case of strange activity, taking POS systems offline
and repopulating them is a safe mediation step in order to avoid possible
loss of reputation, or lawsuit by individuals who had their credit card
information stolen, and possibly used by threat actors.
*Tags:* POS malware, UDPOS, Credit card data theft



*The latest trend in security threats.  All your base is belonged to the
Miners*



*Thousands of Government, Orgs? Websites Found Serving Crypto Mining
Script *
<https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/02/12/websites-found-serving-crypto-mining-script/>
(*February 12, 2018*)
Security researcher Scott Helme discovered that the U.K.?s Information
Commissioner?s Office (ICO) had a crypto miner installed on it. Further
investigation led Helme to discover that the cause of this incident was the
compromise of the ?Browsealoud? service run by U.K. firm Texthelp; the
service uses a JavaScript that ?adds speech, reading, and translation to
websites.? Texthelp?s script server was compromised and threat actors added
an obfuscated script to the Browsealoud one that would limit the processing
power of the crypto miner to assist in staying hidden. Researchers believe
that approximately 4,200 websites were infected as a result of this
incident.
*Recommendation:* Sometimes webmasters discover that one of their sites has
been compromised months after the initial infection. Websites, much like
personal workstations, require constant maintenance and upkeep in order to
adapt to the latest threats. In addition to keeping server software up to
date, it is critical that all external facing assets are monitored and
scanned for vulnerabilities. The ability to easily restore from backup,
incident response planning, and customer communication channels should all
be established before a breach occurs.
