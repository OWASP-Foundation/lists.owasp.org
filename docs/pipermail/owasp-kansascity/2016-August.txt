Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] You're invited to OWASP KC - August 2016 (Aug 30,
	2016)
Message-ID: <20160819121528.416AE2CF19@prod-task-app1.evbops.com>

We've got an exciting talk for everyone this month! &nbsp;We had to push the meeting a week to get scheduling issues worked out, but thankfully there are five Tuesdays in August, so it's all good!
&nbsp;
Our speaker for August will be Luke Crouch, with the Mozilla Foundation. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
Luke says: &nbsp;I write web code at&nbsp;Mozilla. I organize some local tech communities:&nbsp;Tulsa Web Devs' mission is to make Tulsa on of the greatest cities in the world for web developers. Code for Tulsa is our&nbsp;Code for America Brigade.&nbsp;Techlahoma&nbsp;is a state-wide foundation to support grassroots technology communities. I owe all my best experiences to the open-source community and try to give back. I sometimes work on an open-source side project start-up:&nbsp;codesy.io. I sometimes brew my own beer.
&nbsp;
Luke will be speaking about online privacy, user tracking, fraud, and cookies. &nbsp;Mmm, cookies.: &nbsp;There are over 5,000 online trackers that use cookies, fingerprinting, and probabilistic device matching to follow you across the web. Some methods are actively used for fraud, malware, and intrusive user tracking. Some are commonly used for legit purposes. We'll talk about how sites are able to follow users, tracking methods both fair and foul, and how users, developers, companies, and governments can defend against tracking.
&nbsp;
We're excited that Luke is willing to take the time to come join us, and looking forward to his talk. &nbsp;We hope you will join us as well. &nbsp;As usual, registration is not required, but appreciated, so we can plan!
Share this event on Facebook and Twitter We hope you can make it!Cheers,OWASP-KC
