Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] volunteers requested to run a table and
	respresent OWASP at KCDC
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVXc8a9wB46UTzXrwr6CLZKPmApdMa7SDpu2nFc0danOJw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings KC OWASP chapter:

In past years we have been present at the K.C. Developers Conference
to promote web and software security to developers (many of whom had
never even heard of SQL injection for instance).

Conference dates this year are May 15-17 at the Kansas City Convention Center.

The KCDC web site is:  http://www.kcdc.info/

We are planning to have a table again this year and would like
volunteers to staff it.

This involves setting up a table (30 minutes) and then answering
questions for attendees, being a resource for the local community on
appsec topics.  In the past it's been fun and a great day for
networking.

If you are interested involunteering, please email or call and we can
get people scheduled in.

Best regards,
