<PRE>We are fortunate to present two KC-OWASP meetings this month: November 10
and November 17

Please mark on your calendars these two dates for OWASP meetings in
November.  There are no plans for OWASP meetings in December, as scheduling
is always particularly challenging around the holidays.



November 10 5:30PM to 8PM

Speakers: Alex Horan and Adam Castonguay, Core Security / Core Impact

Location: Hosted by Sirius Computer Solutions
10801 Mastin Boulevard, Suite 900   Overland Park, KS   66210
www.siriuscom.com

For those not familiar, Core Impact is a penetration testing toolkit and
framework, often compared to Metasploit.
Recent features of Core Impact called WebVerify now address web security
weaknesses and flaws.  The presentation will cover the new
web functionalities such as session manipulation and attacks against web
infrastructure and the speakers will be
available to answer quetsions about the network and other non-web-focused
features in Core Impact after their talk.

November 17 from 6PM-8PM

Speakers: Ryan Biel and Jim Manico, OWASP board member and WhiteHat security

Location: Johnson County Community College Regnier Center room 344
Johnson County Community College
12345 College Boulevard
Overland Park, Kansas 66210
<A HREF="http://www.jccc.edu/maps/index.html">http://www.jccc.edu/maps/index.html</A>

Jim Manico will be presenting on OWASP and the ESAPI.

There will be opportunities to have questions answered about WhiteHat's
software as a service model for rolling out
enterprise level web security services in your organization.




We are starting to plan now for January-March  2012, so please send your
speaker suggestions to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-kansascity">caughron at gmail.com.</A>

These are both phenomenal opportunities to learn about the state of the art
in web security.  See you there!
