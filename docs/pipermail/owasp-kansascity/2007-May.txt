Hi everyone, sorry for the late notice.  For some reason, messages
sent from my FishNet email address are failing to make it to the list.
 I'm using my GMail account for now.

Well it's been very quiet on our list lately.  Everyone in KC has
probably been busy with projects.  I know I have!  Anyway, I finally
have a date and location for our next OWASP-KC chapter meeting.

When: Wednesday, June 13, 2007, 6:30-8:30 pm.
Where: FishNet Security at 1627 Main Street, KC, MO, 7th floor

The agenda has yet to be decided.  Please let me know if you have a
topic you'd like to present.

Have good Memorial Day weekend!
