Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] July Meeting - Tomorrow - Social Meeting!
Message-ID: <CAD6LLGgBnV536TdNOV9c_KvkGZJbisbM=u8+wFeWffyNZ95fJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all! Due to a conflict at the usual meeting location, and having been
out of town, we're going to have a social meeting for July. We can chat
about some of the interesting stuff I picked up at OSCON last week, ideas
for things for upcoming meetings, and have a beer or some coffee! No formal
agenda, just a chance to hang out and talk AppSec or whatever else floats
your boat.

More info here:

Note the change in location. If you're not familiar with it, Thou Mayest is
a coffee shop near 18th and Oak, which also happens to have beer. Our usual
location is available next month, so we'll be back there in August. If you
get there and can't find us, give me a call or a text at 816-398-8143! I
will plan on being there a little early in the hopes of grabbing a decent
spot.

JF
