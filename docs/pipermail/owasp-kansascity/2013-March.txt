Greetings fellow OWASP Kansas Citians:

A brief reminder that we're one week out from the April meeting, which
takes place at 6:15PM on April 4th.
Location: Johnson County Community College Regnier Center Room 183 and
there is typically plentiful parking in the area.
FishNet will be presenting on Secure SDLC and OpenSAMM

Also in April : on the 16-17th, SecureWorld rolls into town to the
Kansas City Convention Center:

If you are attending and would be interested in handing out or
otherwise making OWASP chapter information available to the
SecureWorld attendees, please drop me a note.

Finally, we have had a presence at the KCDC event in the past.  Next
KC dev.Conference is May 2,3.  http://kcdc.info/
Interested in attending?  Contact me and we'll see about putting a
booth together with OWASP give-aways like we did last time.

interested in helping man the table, please let me and Mat know!
