Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] UMB InfoSec Engineer Position
Message-ID: <CAM_WTqZ+w=wTfrMtRe=Xynx2XER8BrdrWiBf=565UO1pXdE6ew@mail.gmail.com>

UMB is looking for an InfoSec Engineer, and we really need someone in the
AppSec field.  (Despite the wording of the job posting - we have a generic
job description that gets used for job postings.)  If you're an AppSec
person (especially if you speak LDAP, IDM, Java, C#, X.509, Authentication,
etc), and are looking for a spot at a good company, drop me an e-mail;
would love to hear from you.

Posting is here:

(Or it's job req 71448 on the UMB careers site if the link doesn't work.)

PS>  Mat, hopefully this is an acceptable use of the OWASP list.
