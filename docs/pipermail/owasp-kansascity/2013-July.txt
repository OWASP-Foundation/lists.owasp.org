Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] OWASP and (ISC)2 have formed a formal partnership
Message-ID: <CAN4hdVX-pbOzNK7yOZtJ_8gWcm-=U244R4QHh3kOb=GBEntvrA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings:

OWASP and (ISC)2 have formed a formal partnership to help promote each
others events throughout the year.

As part of the agreement they have offered OWASP Members a 20%
discount off their Security Congress 2013 event happening Sept 24-27,
2013 in Chicago. IL.

Anyone interested?  Ping me off-list.

We anticipate kicking off K.C. chapter OWASP meetings after the summer
cools down a bit and BlackHat and DefCon21 have come and gone, so late
August/early Sept is the next targeted chapter meeting.

Best,


Mat
