Hi everyone,

Our next OWASP-KC chapter meeting is scheduled for March 7, 2007 from 6:30 to 8:00 pm.  This time
we're going to meet in Overland Park... Corporate Woods to be exact.  The local Microsoft office has
agreed to host our meeting.  

The address is:  

10801 Mastin Blvd.
Corporate Woods Office Park
Overland Park, KS  66210

I'll be working on an agenda over the next few weeks.  Please let me know if you have a topic of
interest or would like to present (good CPE credits!).  We had a great December meeting where we
discussed a variety of application security issues.  I'm expecting our next meeting to be even better.
Hope to see you in March!
