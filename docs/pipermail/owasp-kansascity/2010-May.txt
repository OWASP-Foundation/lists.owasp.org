Greetings Kansas City OWASP chapter attendees

Attached is our annual report.   I believe this is a useful advocacy
piece to help your management understand what OWASP is about, why
chapter attendance is useful, and to help us gain membership here in
Kansas City.

The industry committee is specifically seeking to grow awareness in
the following sectors:
    ?	Energy ?	Medical ?	Financial ?	Government
These sectors are all very strong in the greater K.C. area and I
encourage you to recruit and advocate to help grow awareness around
the OWASP mission to promote secure software development.

We continue our search for engaging K.C. chapter speakers and meeting
locations - your input is welcome!

Thanks,
