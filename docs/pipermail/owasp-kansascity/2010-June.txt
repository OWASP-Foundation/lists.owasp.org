	raffle announcement
Message-ID: <AANLkTikg-AceqEaiZn8QeAPIudgGL97JVn4_-F6ekfZQ@mail.gmail.com>

OWASP Kansas City members:

This Thursday we have some swanky OWASP branded items given away, so
please bring a business card for the raffle.

As is customary, there is no charge for our chapter meetings, so
please bring a friend.

BalancePoint is located at 2300 Main Street, Suite 910, in the Two
Pershing Square building.
This is right behind (north of) Union Station and directly across the
tracks from the Freight House district.

To park, pull into the circle drive and look for the ramp leading below.
There is plenty of parking underneath.  Balance Point has offered to
validate each ticket.
You?ll take the garage elevators to the lobby, then a second set of
elevators to the 9th floor.

The OWASP meeting is at Suite 910, located in the southeast corner of
the building.


See you Thursday, 6PM.
