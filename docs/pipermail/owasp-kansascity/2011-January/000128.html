<PRE>Greetings, KC OWASP chapter:

The meeting invite had a mistake in it that made the meeting span 4 weeks.

Fixed.  The list should get another invitation with the correct dates and
times.

Thank you Chad for catching this!

David Remington is a Systems Engineer for f5 Networks and member of the
Security Subject Matter Expert Team. He has over 15 years of experience
architecting and implementing network and application security solutions
as a customer, consultant, partner and instructor. Dave specializes in
security implementations, critical incident response and providing

This meeting presentation will include a discussion of web application best
practices
and how F5's technology solutions can give organizations the tools to
address the OWASP Top-10. It will focus on both traditional security
topics as well as new emerging solutions and show how embedding
application fluency and security along with user authentication and access
into the network can provide strategic points of control which empower
organizations to mitigate application vulnerabilities, consolidate user
access and control and secure web services.
