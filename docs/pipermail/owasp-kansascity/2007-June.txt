Greetings!  Well we had a good meeting on Wednesday.  At first it seemed everyone forgot, but people
eventually started rolling in and we had a good turnout, especially considering it was such a nice
evening and June is a time that people have vacations, activities, etc.

I've updated the OWASP.org site with a summary of the meeting and made the presentation materials
available for download.  I'm still waiting on the final version of one document, but it will be out
there soon.

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] Looking for new chapter leader
Message-ID: <6868F396F5637540AE9D274CC90BD88F064C5E1F@FNEX01.fishsec.com>

Dear OWASP-KC members,

Sorry for the multiple emails you may have received yesterday.  Apparently the OWASP lists were
"stuck" until I finally told the right person about the problem.  

As some of you know, last week was my last meeting as the Kansas City OWASP chapter leader.  The
reason is that I'll be relocating to the Dallas, TX area soon.  I'll be joining FishNet's team down
there.  Anyway, KC needs a new chapter leader to set up meetings and keep everything rolling.  Please
let me know if you are interested in being in that role.  There's one person who's contacted me
already, but to be fair I would like to know if there are others.  I've enjoyed getting the KC chapter
active and would like to see it continue and get stronger!

Thanks,
