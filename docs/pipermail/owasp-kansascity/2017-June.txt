Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] NO MEETING FOR JUNE
Message-ID: <CAD6LLGgR2jZhQJMn560r2swTCAfAboTtS8wZtOWRH1g7s4pQQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, all - Apologies for the late notice, but there will be no June
meeting - I've been out of town and am just juggling too many things right
now to have time to pull something together.  Plan on the next meeting
being July 25 at the usual time and location!
