Greetings:

A quick heads-up on the new Top Ten being released on Monday.

We'll take a few minutes during our chapter meeting on Thursday to run
through what is new in the OWASP Top 10 for 2010 at the Kansas City meeting
on April 22.  Opportunities for open discussion as always - bring your best
questions for the group.

There will be an informal (all OWASP chapter attendees are invited)
gathering at Houston's nearby on the Plaza after the official meeting on
Thursday evening where we can continue the discussion over drinks.

Cheers,


Mat Caughron
Kansas City chapter interim president

 OWASP Leaders,



Attached is an internal release of the final OWASP Top 10 for 2010. We are
providing this as a sneak preview for all of you and we are *asking for your
help*. Please do not release this publically until Monday after the press
release goes out (listed below). Feel free to forward to press contacts and
other writers.



As you can see in the press release, we are trying hard to expand our
audience beyond the security community to reach the people that matter the
most, the developers that are producing all the applications we are so
concerned about.



Please help us make sure every developer in the ENTIRE WORLD knows about the
OWASP Top 10 by helping to spread the world. Please blog, tweet, e-mail,
post, speak about, and forward the OWASP Top 10 to everyone who you think
needs to be aware of this, particularly developers. Discuss it at your
chapter meetings, offer to give talks about it at your local university,
etc. and please reuse my OWASP DC Conference presentation on the Top 10,
which I will update soon to reflect the final release.



As you help us spread the word, please emphasize:

?       The new Top 10 is about managing risk, not just avoiding
vulnerabilities

?       OWASP is reaching out to developers, not just the application
security community

?       To manage these risks, organizations need an application risk
management program, not just awareness training, app testing, and
remediation



We need to encourage organizations to get off the penetrate and patch
mentality. As Jeff Williams said in his 2009 OWASP AppSec DC Keynote: ?we?ll
never hack our way secure ? it?s going to take a culture change? for
organizations to properly address application security.



Thank you for your help.



Thanks, Dave



p.s. I wanted to also take a moment to thank all of you for your significant
contributions to OWASP and the application security community. Its all of
you that make OWASP so great.



Dave Wichers

OWASP Board Member, OWASP Conferences Chair, and OWASP Top 10 Project Lead









FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:



*OWASP TOP 10 FOR 2010 RELEASED*

*Will You Help Us Reach Every Web Developer in the World?*

* *

Columbia, MD 4/19/2010 ?



Since 2003, application security researchers and experts from all over the
world at the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) have carefully
monitored the state of web application security and produced an awareness
document that is acknowledged and relied on by organizations worldwide,
including the PCI, DOD, FTC, and countless others.



Today, OWASP has released an updated report capturing the top ten risks
associated with the use of web applications in an enterprise. This colorful
22 page report is packed with examples and details that explain these risks
to software developers, managers, and anyone interested in the future of web
security. Everything at OWASP is free and open to everyone, and you can
download the latest OWASP Top 10 report for free at:

*http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10 *

Dave Wichers, OWASP Board member and COO of Aspect Security, has managed the
project since its inception. ?This year we have revamped the Top 10 to make
it clear that we are talking about risks, not just vulnerabilities. Attempts
to prioritize vulnerabilities without context just don?t make sense. You
can?t make proper business decisions without understanding the threat and
impact to your business.? This new focus on risks is intended to lead
organizations to more mature understanding and management of application
security across their organization.



The time has come to get application security awareness out of the security
community and directly to the people who need to know it most. This year,
our audacious goal is to get the OWASP Top 10 into the hands of *every web
developer in the world* ? but we need your help.  We ask anyone reading
this; would you be willing to do one simple thing to help protect the future
of the Internet?  If you know people who write code for the web, could you
forward them the OWASP Top 10 and ask them kindly?



---------------------------------------------------



*Are you familiar with all of the risks in the OWASP Top 10?*

* *

*Will you make a commitment today to protect your code against the OWASP Top
10?*



---------------------------------------------------



For too long, many organizations have relied exclusively on an occasional
scan or penetration test to gain assurance for their internal and external
web applications. This approach is expensive and doesn't provide much in the
way of coverage. Like other types of security, application security requires
a risk management program that provides visibility across the entire
portfolio and strategic controls to improve security. If your organization
is ready to tackle application security, there are dozens of free books,
tools, projects, forums, mailing lists, and more at OWASP. You can also join
one of over 180 local chapters worldwide or attend our high quality and
inexpensive AppSec conferences.



The OWASP Top 10 for 2010 are:

*A1: Injection*

*A2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) *

*A3: Broken Authentication and Session Management *

*A4: Insecure Direct Object References *

*A5: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) *

*A6: Security Misconfiguration *

*A7: Insecure Cryptographic Storage *

*A8: Failure to Restrict URL Access *

*A9: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection*

*A10: Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards *

* *

The 2010 update is based on more sources of web application vulnerability
information than the previous versions were when determining the new Top 10.
It also presents this information in a more concise, compelling, and
consumable manner, and includes strong references to the many new openly
available resources that can help address each issue, particularly OWASP's
new Enterprise Security API (ESAPI)
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI>and Application
Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS>projects.

Known issues & missing features

We have made significant progress towards reaching our first full

and we appreciate your time and effort. ?As always, we are doing our
best to make you aware of continuing development and items within the
engine that are not yet complete. ?With this in mind, please notice the
list we have included of known items we are working on.

- Using the http_cookie keyword seems to cause a match on all packets.
- Currently we dont' support the dce option for byte_test and byte_jump.
- Stream reassembly is currently only performed for app-layer code.
- Inconsistent time stamps in http log file due to handling & updating
of the http state.
- DCE/RPC over udp is not currently supported.
- dce_stub_data does not respect relative modifiers.
- Engine does not work properly on big endian platforms.
- Time based stats are not calculated correctly.

See https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/projects/suricata/issues
