<PRE>Hello,

I wanted to let everyone know that I've confirmed a speaker and a
meeting date for our next KC OWASP chapter meeting.  Here are the
details:

Date: April 30, 2008 - 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM

Security Access Mark-up Language (SAML) &amp; Single Sign-on Implementation
Presented by Karen Fritsche and Sarah Heinen

To accomplish a Web Single Sign-On application with their brokerage back
office vendor, American Century Investments solution included the use of
SAML.  This presentation will provide an overview of: SAML, its benefits
and several Single Sign-On options; integration, architecture and
configuration options; and the SAML SSO implementation completed by
American Century Investments.

Karen Fritsche is an Application Architect and Sarah Heinen is a
Programmer / Analyst with American Century Investments in Kansas City.
As part of the IT application development team that supports the
company's retail web sites www.americancentury.com and
www.learningquestsavings.com, they focus on the secure on-line financial
transactions of the sites, either through internal services or by
establishing single sign-on connectivity to third party vendor sites.

- We have time for another person to give a brief 15-45 minute
presentation on web application security. This can be a technical
demonstration, conference review, or open discussion about a web
application security topic. Please let me know if you'd like to grab
this spot.


Location:
Centriq Training
8700 State Line Road
Suite 200
Leawood, KS 66206
(913) 322-7000

application security is welcome to attend. Pass on this meeting
announcement to anyone else that would benefit from joining us.  No
registration is required, although RSVPs are appreciated for space
planning purposes.

Hope to see all of you there.
