<PRE>My name is Garrett Goggans, a doctoral student at Colorado Technical
University. I am in the process of doing a study on the strategies needed by
web application developers to adopt the security practices of a secure
software development lifecycle. 

To conduct this study, I need to interview 10 professionals who have
successfully integrated such security practices within a software
development lifecycle. I am currently 4 participants short and need to
finalize these interviews this weekend or the study will be cancelled. 

Understanding the importance of web application security, this
correspondence is to invite you to participate in the study offering up the
much needed guidance to successfully integrate a secure software development
lifecycle by answering the following 10 questions:



1.	What is your experience with adopting the security practices of a
secure software development lifecycle?
2.	What do you believe the advantages of adopting these security
practices to be?
3.	What do you believe the disadvantages of adopting these security
practices to be?
4.	What strategies did you have to change to adopt/integrate the
security practices successfully?
5.	What strategies were you able to keep in place to adopt/integrate
the security practices successfully?
6.	What challenges did you face during the adoption/integration?
7.	What were the non-technological resources needed to successfully do
the adoption/integration?
8.	What were the technological resources needed for a successful
integration/adoption?
9.	What advice would you give other web application developers who are
trying to adopt a secure software development lifecycle?
10.	What other items should be added to our discussion?

 

The discussion of these questions will last roughly an hour. In addition,
each participant must meet the following criteria in order to participate:



1.	Must currently work, or have worked, within an adoption and/or
integration of secure software development lifecycle giving them the ability
to speak intelligently on the topic.
2.	Must have been upper management or, at a minimum, a senior level
professional who had the authority to make integration decisions, or provide
input for decisions made, at the time of the integration.

 

Please note that I can ensure complete confidentiality and anonymity through
the guidelines that must be followed by the study. If you are interested in
participating in this study, please respond back to me to begin the next
steps of the process.

Thank you for your time.

Garrett Goggans
