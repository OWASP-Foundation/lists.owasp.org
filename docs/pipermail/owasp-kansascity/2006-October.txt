Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] Anyone going to OWASP/Appsec Seattle next week?
Message-ID: <6868F396F5637540AE9D274CC90BD88F1A3535@FNEX01.fishsec.com>

I am  forwarding a message Barry sent to the old Sourceforge
mailing address...btw all, update and use @lists.owasp.org
for future list mailing; I am leaving KC permanently a week
from this Friday, and will be turning over the list and local
Chapter to one of my peers in the area...once I find someone
interested in running the Chapter (and if that person is you,
email me asap):

Barry Archer asked:


        Anyone getting to go to the conference next week?  Unfortunately, my current schedule prevents
me from trying to attend this year. 
        
        I was hoping that someone from KC might be going, and that there would be enough interest in
hearing from them to include in a kick-off OWASP chapter meeting... 



                Thanks,
