Hello All,

Jenny Hoff (http://jennyhoff.com/), has started posting interviews she
conducted at AppSec USA.   She kicked it off with an interview with Jeff
Williams on "What is OWASP?".

http://www.youtube.com/user/owasptv

The purpose of the interview series is an outreach program - to capture the
voices of OWASP and continue to make appsec more visible!

Jenny is an international journalist who has been on CNN, Deutsche Welle,
and did political reporting for several years at KXAN in Austin, Texas.

Incidentally, she has been covering appsec for a while now - Here's an
older interview she did with RSnake back in the day:

OWASP Leaders, please help me welcome this outreach initiative and Jenny.
 More interviews from AppSec USA will continue to be posted in the
following days, and hopefully Jenny will continue this initiative.  So if
you want your project or work to be highlighted in this way, feel free to
reach out to Jenny (cc'ed).

Thanks all,

Jerry

Kansas City Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) chapter
meeting announcement:

When:   Thursday, December 13, 2012 from 6-8pm

Presentation Title: Implementing Security Testing within the SDLC.

Speaker:  Based in Joplin Missouri, Stephen Jensen is presently a
consultant with British Telecom's global services unit, and has been
performing web application security assessments for over 9 years. With
a background as a software developer, it was his experiences within
the software industry that led him to shift his focus more towards the
security aspect of software.  Steve will be covering:

1) Overview of different software development models (traditional
models never had security in as a requirement)
2) What is the purpose of an application assessment?
????? Automated assessment
????? Manual assessment
3) What is the purpose of a code review?
?? ?? Automated review
?? ?? Manual review
4) Benefits of doing conjunctive testing versus doing one or the other.

Steve is a great speaker and this is an important topic for any
company that produces or uses software.

Where:  Room 183 in the Regnier Center at Johnson County Community College
 12345 College Boulevard Overland Park, KS 66210-1299

See you there!
