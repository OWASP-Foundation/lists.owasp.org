I may give an extemporaneous and potentially fun talk about the Top Ten.

Hope to see you there,

Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] summary of presentation on July 9 at KCSEC-OWASP
	joint meeting

Greetings Kansas City OWASP chapter:

A special thanks to Bill Swearingen for the invitation for our chapter to
attend the KCSec this month,  Here is a brief summary of the presentation
delivered on Wednesday evening.

*1. Security Weaknesses Happen at the Interfaces*
Example was given of PSIRT-VTS, Cisco's vulnerability tracking system.
 When looking for real-world vulnerabilities, consider wherever the
integrations occur.

*2. Trust is a Balance*
Consider the root certificates in your cell phone.  You might want to pare
the list down or contact your mobile OS vendor and ask for only the
certificates that you see fit to trust.

*3. There Are Always More Tools*
see: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix/Tools
In the face of an unlimited toolset, the focus for appsec and infosec staff
is necessarily more strategic than tactical.

We'll be taking a break for summer and will start planning fall 2014
meetings in late August / early September.  As always, we continue to seek
insightful speakers for the chapter meetings and encourage you to present
and/or make introductions to appsec vendors who have a particularly timely
story to tell.
