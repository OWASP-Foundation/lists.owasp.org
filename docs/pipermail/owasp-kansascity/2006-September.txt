Subject: [Owasp-kansascity] OWASP KC Chapter Meeting
Message-ID: <6868F396F5637540AE9D274CC90BD88F1A343B@FNEX01.fishsec.com>

OWASP KC List members:

I've been waiting for travel to slow down to
host KC OWASP events, but finally realized that
isn't realistic. So we are going to proceed with
or without me to host the meetings, as otherwise
we're not fostering the community resource this
could and should be in Kansas City.

It's time to make an informal list-vote. Please
reply to the list and we'll make a thread of this,
and I'll tally the votes:


+ When do you want to meet?
(weekday lunch|evening|weekend)


+ Where do you want to meet?
(N|S|E|W)


+ What topic do you want to discuss?
(technical|organizational|SDLC|regional issues)


(Please write in your own specific answers for
the above; the parenthetics are suggestions only)

Coordinating a big launch meeting is beyond
my ability ATM, so an informal meet-and-greet
might be the way to go, and discuss how to
move forward, and what common interests are.

If we identify enough common interests through
this thread, in which case we'll go with that
for our meeting.

Thanks,

My preference would be in the South in the Evening during the week sometime.

The topic could be anything.  Or maybe for the first meeting just have a
meet and greet to get to know other security professionals in the area.

Anywhere is ok with me as long as it is in the evening, but I would probably prefer the South Side of KC as well.
 
 I would prefer technical topics (practical experience, Case Studies, etc), but maybe the first meeting should be just a meet and greet.
