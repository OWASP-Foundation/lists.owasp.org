<PRE>*Latest example of why you should stop using browser extensions*



*Critical Flaw in Grammarly Spell Checker Could Let Attackers Steal Your
Data * &lt;<A HREF="https://thehackernews.com/2018/02/grammar-checking-software.html">https://thehackernews.com/2018/02/grammar-checking-software.html</A>&gt;(*February
5, 2018*)
Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a vulnerability in
the &#8220;Grammarly&#8221; spell-checking extension for Chrome and Firefox. The
vulnerability affects approximately 22 million Grammarly users by exposing
authentication tokens to all websites that a user visits. A threat actor
could exploit this vulnerability could steal said authentication tokens
with a measly four lines of code, according to researchers.
*Recommendation:* Grammarly has since issued a patch for this
vulnerability, and updates are available for Chrome and Firefox browsers.
At the time of this writing, Grammarly states that does not appear that
anyone has been affected by this vulnerability. However, with Ormandy&#8217;s
proof-of-concept code for exploitation of this vulnerability publicly
available it is likely threat actors will attempt to use said code for
malicious purposes. Web browsers and extensions should always be kept
up-to-date with the latest security patches because as this story portrays,
exploitation code is often made available on open sources.

firewall.  You should all be pointed to your internal DNS servers!!!*



*UDPOS &#8211; Exfiltrating Credit Card Data via DNS *
&lt;<A HREF="https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/udpos-exfiltrating-credit-card-data-dns">https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/udpos-exfiltrating-credit-card-data-dns</A>&gt;
(*February 8, 2018*)
A Point-of-Sale (POS) malware, dubbed &#8220;UDPOS,&#8221; is being distributed by
threat actors by impersonating a service pack provided by &#8220;LogMeln,&#8221;.
According to Forcepoint researchers one sample, of UDPOS, has been observed
in the wild, and there is evidence to suggesting it is being used. Evidence
consists of LogMeln file names and Command and Control (C2) URLs. If the
fake package is downloaded and the file named &#8220;update.exe&#8221; is executed, the
content of the file is automatically launched with 7-Zip&#8217;s &#8220;RunProgram&#8221;
feature. The malware then creates a new service to maintain persistence on
an affected system. UDPOS is designed to steal magnetic stripe data (Track
1 and Track 2) from debit and credit cards by scraping the memory of
running processes.
*Recommendation:* POS networks should carefully be monitored for unusual
activity, thus keeping logs of what typical network activity looks like is
very important. In the case of strange activity, taking POS systems offline
and repopulating them is a safe mediation step in order to avoid possible
loss of reputation, or lawsuit by individuals who had their credit card
information stolen, and possibly used by threat actors.

*The latest trend in security threats.  All your base is belonged to the
Miners*



*Thousands of Government, Orgs&#8217; Websites Found Serving Crypto Mining
Script *
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/02/12/websites-found-serving-crypto-mining-script/">https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/02/12/websites-found-serving-crypto-mining-script/</A>&gt;
(*February 12, 2018*)
Security researcher Scott Helme discovered that the U.K.&#8217;s Information
Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) had a crypto miner installed on it. Further
investigation led Helme to discover that the cause of this incident was the
compromise of the &#8220;Browsealoud&#8221; service run by U.K. firm Texthelp; the
service uses a JavaScript that &#8220;adds speech, reading, and translation to
websites.&#8221; Texthelp&#8217;s script server was compromised and threat actors added
an obfuscated script to the Browsealoud one that would limit the processing
power of the crypto miner to assist in staying hidden. Researchers believe
that approximately 4,200 websites were infected as a result of this
incident.
*Recommendation:* Sometimes webmasters discover that one of their sites has
been compromised months after the initial infection. Websites, much like
personal workstations, require constant maintenance and upkeep in order to
adapt to the latest threats. In addition to keeping server software up to
date, it is critical that all external facing assets are monitored and
scanned for vulnerabilities. The ability to easily restore from backup,
incident response planning, and customer communication channels should all
be established before a breach occurs.
