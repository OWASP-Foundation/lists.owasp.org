<PRE>Hey, all - A recruiter I've worked with previously reached out to me with
this opening in the KC Area, as she's having a hard time finding
low-/mid-level AppSec folks.  I thought I would share the opening if anyone
here was looking (I promise I'm not going to spam the list with job
postings all the time):

Mid-level Security Analyst that has at least 1-2 years&#8217; experience
preforming web application and network vulnerability assessments (both
manual/automated testing) as well as experience with different security
systems (SIEM, IDS/IPS, Anti-malware). You&#8217;ll be in charge of finding
vulnerabilities, remediating vulnerabilities, as well as documenting the
results.

Information Security Analyst Responsibilities:
&#8226;    Work with security team to perform tests and uncover vulnerabilities.
&#8226;    Security incident response management
&#8226;    Develop company-wide best practices for IT security.
&#8226;    Perform penetration testing (this can be trained!)
&#8226;    Research security enhancements and make recommendations to management.
&#8226;    Stay up-to-date on information technology trends and security
standards.

Information Security Analyst Requirements:
&#8226;    Bachelor's degree IS required
&#8226;    Certifications are preferred but not mandatory
&#8226;    At least 3 years of experience in IT Security as a whole, 1-2 years of
Web App Security
&#8226;    General PowerShell and Python scripting knowledge is a MUST

If you're interested, contact Katie Esklund -

[This does not constitute an endorsement of Katie or the position, just
wanted to share the information.  In the future I will prefix any job
postings on this list with '[JOB]', so feel free to filter those out if you
don't want to see them.  In addition, if you're a recruiter wanting to post
jobs to the list, please send them through me, do not post them directly to
the list.  - JF ]
