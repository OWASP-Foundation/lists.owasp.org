Hi all:

 

My name is Bill Landry and I work with some of the top tech companies in the Chicago area. I have a Director Level job available and its main functions are to build and service scalable security services for applications, spot vulnerability trends, ensure application security, and provide technical expertise and collaborate with other information security teams.

 

If you are interested in this Chicago position or know anyone you think I should be talking with, please shoot me an email. You would have to relocate to the Chicago area, company does pay for relocation.

 

 

 

Thanks

Bill Landry

You are invited to the April meeting of the Kansas City Chapter of the Open
Web Application Security Project!

We are excited to announce that for this month we have *Shogo
Cottrell*, *Security
Strategist at HP Enterprise Security*, to speak about Application Security
and the 2016 HP Cyber Risk Report, which highlighted Application Security
as one of the key areas of focus for Information Security in 2016:

   - *Attackers have shifted their efforts to directly attack
   applications - The perimeter of your network is no longer where you think
   it is. With today?s mobile devices and broad interconnectivity, the actual
   perimeter of your network is likely in your pocket right now. Attackers
   realize this as well and have shifted their focus from servers and
   operating systems directly to applications.*

Shogo has been an active participant in the KC Information Security
community for many years, and we are looking forward to his presentation!
If you have (or are!) a developer needing a high-level view of the
importance of application security, this will likely be a great meeting to
attend.

As usual, the meeting will be from 6:30 to 8:00pm at the Kauffman
Foundation Conference Center, just East of the Plaza.  Please RSVP if
possible so we can provide an accurate count to the facility, but don't let
a lack of RSVP discourage you from attending!
