It's the OWASP-KC meeting for April!  Better late than never, right?  (But
it's always the 4th Tuesday of the month - so it's on your calendar anyway,
right?!)

This is going to be a collaborative meeting, with 3 different topics:

   1.

   We're going to try something new this year, and get a little more
   hands-on - roughly every other meeting (will vary depending on speaker
   availability) will be a project meeting, where we'll start collaborative
   development of a secure software project - and this meeting is going to be
   our kickoff.  We'll try to get some of the initial details hashed out, like
   -what- we're going to develop, what language(s) we're going to use, and
   what the structure is going to look like.  If you're interested in
   participating, this is a great meeting to be at!
   2.

   We'll have a short discussion about our Day of AppSec event in October;
   not a full planning meeting, but getting the larger organization engaged in
   the conversation!
   3.

   If we have time, we'll talk about the OWASP Top Ten 2017 Release
   Candidate that was recently sent out to the OWASP Leaders, and gather
   opinions to provide feedback to the Top Ten committee!  This is a great
   chance to get more engaged in the larger OWASP organization!
   You can read the release candidate here:
   https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/raw/master/2017/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202017%20RC1-English.pdf
   and some commentary here

   among many others.

Hopefully this announcement isn't too late, and those who are interested
can make it!
