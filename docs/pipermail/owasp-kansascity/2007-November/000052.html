<PRE>
Thanks to those of you who showed up at our November KC OWASP chapter
meeting.  We had a great turnout of around a dozen people, many of which
were new faces.  I hope to see you all again at future meetings.

Tom Stripling's presentation did a great job introducing the challenges
of securely integrating third-party content and produced some good
discussions among the group.  Thank you Tom for taking time to speak to
our chapter.  If you would like to review Tom's presentation slides, you
can find them here:

I mentioned that there is a national OWASP group for users of LinkedIn.
Joining this group shows people reviewing your profile that you
recognize the importance of application security and support OWASP
efforts.  You can join the group by following this link:

I am already working on our next KC OWASP chapter meeting for the end of
January.  The plan was to have a speaker discuss application security
code reviews.  However, one of the ideas brought up at our meeting was
to have a panel discussion about a topic.  I've facilitated this type of
group before and they can be a great way of quickly covering different
perspectives on a topic.

While I'm all for this idea I need participants for the panel.  I will
map out the planned areas of discussion ahead of time so you won't be
put on the spot.  All we need is 3 volunteers to make this work.  If you
are willing to share your experiences and opinions about application
security code review I would like for you to send me an email.
