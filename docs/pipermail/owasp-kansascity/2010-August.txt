more towards the security aspect of software. Stephen is an advocate of the
SDLC (Security Development Lifecycle) development process, which attempts to
include security as a primary objective within the requirements phase of the
software development lifecycle, as well as throughout the entire development

Topic: Mobile Device Software Security and Testing Presentation

Introduction:
	- Why we care about these devices?
	- How enterprises are using these devices.
	- Personal data stored on these devices.
	- What we can do depends on the functionality implemented on the device
	- More and more apps are found to be malicious in some way.

	iPhone:
		- What does "jailbreaking" actually do?
		- Installing SSH through Cydia.
		- Using WinSCP to view the underlying filesystem.
		- Files on the file system (sqlite databases, etc.)
		- Proxying WiFi traffic for request/response analysis & manipulation.
		- Proxying 3G traffic through a VPN connection running on a linux VM
(currently researching and setting up).
		- Where are applications located on the device?
		- Extracting the applications off the phone for further analysis.
		- How to get at the application via iTunes if the iPhone is not jailbroken.
		
	
	Android:
		- Rooting the device (not a hands on demonstration as this is
version dependent).
		- Setting up SSH on the device.
		- Using WinScp to view underlying filesystem
		- Proxying 3G traffic through a VPN connection running on a linux VM
(currently researching and setting up).
		- Where are the applications located on the device?

OWASP Leaders,

This is the LAST CALL for AppSec DC Call for Papers that closes
tomorrow 8/31/2010.? You all work really hard for the organization and
it's important that that work be recognized.? The best way to do so is
to present your project at an OWASP conference!? If you are a project
leader and would like to present at AppSec DC this year please go to
https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=appsecdc2010
(account creation for EasyChair Required) and submit a talk about all
the great work your already doing at OWASP.? Additional CFP
information can be found at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_DC_2010#tab=CFP.

This year we are partnering with elements from DHS, NSA, DoD and NIST
to collaborate on content and it's important that OWASP have a strong
showing of our capebilities and products.? I had a conversation with
Joe Jarzombek on Friday and he is espeially looking forward to
introducing all his friends in the federal governemnt to the exciting
work done by OWASP!

You don't need to have a full abstract ready to submit.? If your
interested simply signup and link to your project page in the CFP
abstract.? That's all we'll need to get you on the schedule and into a
great OWASP conference!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or CFP at appsecdc.org.

Thanks,

--
