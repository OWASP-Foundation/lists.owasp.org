*Title: *Reverse proxies & Inconsistency (from ZeroNights 2018)

*Abstract*

/Modern websites are growing more complex with different reverse proxies
and load balancers covering them. They are used for various purposes:
request routing, caching, putting additional headers, restricting
access. In other words, reverse proxies must both parse incoming
requests and modify them in a particular way. However, path parsing may
turn out to be quite a challenge due to mismatches in the parsing of
different web servers. Moreover, request converting may imply a wide
range of different consequences from a information security point of
view. I have analyzed different reverse proxies with different
configurations, the ways they parse requests, apply rules, and perform
caching. In this talk, I will both speak about general processes and the
intricacies of proxy operation and demonstrate the examples of bypassing
restrictions, expanding access to a web application, and new attacks
through the web cache deception and cache poisoning./


Looking forward to seeing you there!

Rod
