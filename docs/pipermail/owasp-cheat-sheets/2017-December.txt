I have added some information about Token Authentication in Ruby on
Rails using devise and devise_token_auth

Hi Jiri,

The article you reference is part of the Cheat Sheet Series project.

For sure it can be enhanced with the missing content.

Do you want to contribute on enhancing it ?

Hi Zaur,

Thanks for the contribution :)

I have one remark about the sentence:
"If you use both ways: cookies and tokens, the paths where cookies are used
for authentication still must be protected from forgery!"

I think we must indicate to developer to prefer token or cookie and for
cookie we need to indicate/remind the importance of the flag:
secure,httponly,samesite and cookie prefixes...

Hi Dominique,

to continue our discussion on rails/devise authentication:

> I think we must indicate to developer to prefer token or cookie

To be honest, there is no strict preference on my side as both
approaches have up- and downsides. Cookies are auto-magical
but allow for CSRF, tokens prevent CSRF but make you need to
have a smart JS front-end managing token authentication.
Usual rails front-end is rather static, it enjoys cookie authentication
mostly.

> and for
> cookie we need to indicate/remind the importance of the flag:
> secure,httponly,samesite and cookie prefixes...

Devise/rails set proper flags on the session cookie themselves.
httponly and path=/ are there by default. Secure is added automatically
once https is used.

I have added a note to start with force_ssl option for environment.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ruby_on_Rails_Cheatsheet#Authentication

Maybe we shall start the cheat sheet with this reminder: "use TLS, this
is how" ?


Now samesite option is an interesting one, but
it has not yet been widely supported:

https://caniuse.com/#search=samesite

Maybe that is why it is not set by default?
I do not think devise supports it even.
Is it something to have a look at next and upgrade devise/rails?

@community: which experience do you have with setting samesite now?
Are there browsers which would react abnormally? (not just ignoring?)

Hi Zaur,

Thanks you for your feedback and your contribution.

About Token vs Cookie:

It can be interesting the add you remark in the CS about which attack
surface imply cookie and token, just to let dev team know these
information in the choice phase.

Thanks for the update on Authentication and TLS, it is important.
Refering to your intro proposal about TLS, we can add in section 2 a sub
section 2.x named "Secure channel" and we can add TLS config info here
(and others specificities about TLS with RoR), what do you think about
this ?

About SameSite flag:

It's true that the support level (only FF and Chrome) is limited so we
can propose to use it but mention that there currently no support on
IE/Edge/Safari so it's to consider as extra and focused hardening.

I have never seen use this flag in site seen in my work...Perhaps due to
the limited supported.

During my POC when IE receive cookie with SameSite flag it ignore the flag.

Hello all.

Sorry for the delay.

I could write a section about HTTPS and tricks with it, like
HSTS, Certificate pinning, cipher suite configuration.

Maybe it also belongs to secure deployment, which I wanted
to be a separate article initially.

Indeed! Great CS!

What I thought of was, how to apply this recommendations when deploying a rails app. E.g. one has to pick a web server, an application server middleware, configure it all, configure the rails app there finally. More hands-on if I may: TLS cheat sheet tells to use 'A' , rails deployment cheat sheet tells, how to do it correctly.



PS,
SRP link to IANA in the TLS CS seems to be broken.

Best Regards,
Zaur.

Hi Zaur,

I think that you can update the tls cs with a main section dedicated to RoR
and indicate how to implement in RoR context the element described in
earlier and global sections.

What do you think?

The problem as I see it Yo is way beyond just attitude. I think you're
missing the point about REST security in a big BIG way which deeply
harms the conversation. I implore you to consider the following words.

REST is all about (1) resources and (2) HTTP conventions. THESE are the
topics I would like us to focus on. There are a LOT of problems to solve
here still. Resources mixed with good access control is very
challenging. HTTP conventions are complex and as they relate to security
such as the fact that REST advocates GET for search which encourages
leakage of sensitive data. THESE are the challenges we should be facing.
We should also discuss HATEOAS which also makes access control quite
complex. In fact, we need to address access control at the resource,
HTTP Verb AND HATEOAS level.

We should also discuss some of the big anti-patterns like burying REST
services deep in your architecture without security - a common pattern
that is very damaging.

Fielding discusses statelessness and REST for performance and caching.
Stateless webservices is a conversation we can have elsewhere. It's
*tangential* to the core issues of REST and security in my opinion.

So I again suggest we all get back to the core of REST - a good resource
to understand the important issues is the /Richardson Rest Maturity
Model/. https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html
Please note statelessness is only briefly discussed here.

On another note, something that I have faced as a board member, is that
when things were not going my way I acted out in very hurtful ways to
myself and the community so I stepped aside. That's why I really left
the board. So if you feel that a certain technical point it not going
you way and you feel like if you do not "win" that argument you want to
leave - that's a sign that you likely should step aside and let other
cooler heads prevail. I say this not in a judgement pointing way, it's a
interpersonal challenge I face myself on a regular basis.

I state[1] all of this with respect.

Aloha, Jim
