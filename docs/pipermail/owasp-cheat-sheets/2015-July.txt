Hello,

If anyone would like to work with me in person to update the cheat sheet 
series in San Franciso this September 22 and 23, I have 1000$ in travel 
money or more that I would be happy to use for someone with expertise 
and interest in helping polish the cheat sheets.

Interested?

	update)
Message-ID: <CA+M5M1dqW5QomUj_1hDrKGA=nLodX3gzdaizorNy-XNN_9qfMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to let you know that I've added a subsection about

   - 3.2 Protocol and Cipher Configuration for Back End and Other
   Connections
   <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet#Protocol_and_Cipher_Configuration_for_Back_End_and_Other_Connections>

in the section '3 Providing Transport Layer Protection for Back End and
Other Connections
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet#Providing_Transport_Layer_Protection_for_Back_End_and_Other_Connections>
'.

I hope you like this addition. Any comments?

Kind regards,
Torsten

Subject: [OWASP-cheat-sheets] Transaction Authorization Cheat Sheet
Message-ID: <CAGJj0CbUd_v7a0NfXgLh4AisCsOdEj2Qm8owbeEMBV1Qz=vzHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I've just published Transaction Authorization Cheat Sheet:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transaction_Authorization_Cheat_Sheet
I hope this will be helpful for banks and developers implementing
transaction authorization using some kind of second factor (OTP via SMS, hw
challenge-response tokens, etc.)

Any feedback will be appreciated.

Regards

I get the point you are making here, good stuff. I want to clean up the 
wording on this a little, but otherwise - thank you for this addition!

Aloha,

Message-ID: <CAEUxY8RLzrcrwsW-g4GRHJZhOACuJnLRkm3vQ3ENQZDaL2tg4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'd like to let you know that I've updated Top Ten Cheat Sheet
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Cheat_Sheet). Now it is
conformant with Top Ten 2013 and it references to Testing Guide V4.
There is still work to do (for example adding content for A9) but now
we can hopefully remove 'old' tag from this cheat sheet. Please
review.

Regards,
Mariusz Ziulek

Thank you for this update. I took the cheat sheet out of "out of date" 
mode because of this work. Thank you!

Aloha,
