Hi,

I'd like to let you know that I've

   - split the 'Server Certificate and Protocol Configuration' in 2
   Sections, the old Link "Server_Certificate_and_Protocol_Configuration
   <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet#Server_Certificate_and_Protocol_Configuration>"
   is still working
   - added the recommendation to use this rules (for Certificates and
   Protocols) also to audit configurations of FIPS 140-2 cryptomodules

I hope this makes the Cheat Sheet easier to read and I think it may be also
useful within compliance restrictions when using a FIPS 140-2
cryptomodule...

Any comments?

Kind regards,

Torsten
