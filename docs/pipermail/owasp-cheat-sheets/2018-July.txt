I can't say YES YES YES to this enough. What do you need from me to help
make it happen? I also BCC'ed in a few other Rails Security experts in
case they wish to review this work...

What I will introduce: one example of using devise right, a mention of zxcvbn gem and improving its usability, an example of using cancancan with a couple of notes, some info about omniauth, infos about creating secure api-only apps, devise token auth for this purpose, xsrf protection in api-only apps, some infos on jwt and client-side sessions.

We continue with rights and deployment management. As an example, I'd build from scratch an nginx with passenger and deploy there. Keeping all the system's components updated while keeping the system up and running is also a challenge to security and availability, a few words on it shall be said. Automated deployment techniques, Capistrano, and monitoring the server shall conclude this guide.
