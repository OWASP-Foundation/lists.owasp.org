Subject: [OWASP-cheat-sheets] Consumer Oriented Cheat Sheet / Top Ten
Message-ID: <816dd058-bcab-2ad6-4048-82343b29df5d@owasp.org>

Hello,

A group of folk are working on a /*Consumer best practice security
guide*/ for the web.  This may migrate into a top ten, cheatsheet or both.

Here is the wiki page being worked on:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Consumer_Best_Practices

I also CC'ed in some of the folks who got this off the ground. (Thank
you Todd, Pax and Anthony)

My goal is for everyone to spend the next few weeks discussing and
researching, meet to establish the initial list after July 5th, and then
move to google docs for final polishing, feedback and editing after we
have the initial rough list established.

Sound good?

Aloha all, Jim

Message-ID: <15590287496.af6f1992485484.8294105723196696202@grayknightsecurity.com>

So to get the discussion rolling... I have put on the page a list of 10 end user vulnerabilities. They are in no particular order and it was all I have come up with so far. I have started to write a little each week on the description, threats, impact and recommendations for each. Not that this is the way we should go, but I started it for the sake of getting started. It is still in the brain-storming stage, I just felt like I needed to do something each week to move it forward. 



I have started mainly by separating the vulnerability and the recommendation. I found that much of what was running through my head was best practices and I needed to work backwards to the vulnerability.



Right now it is written from a security professional's perspective. It will need to be re-written at some point for non-technical users. I guess my baseline is, if I can present it to my dad and have him understand, we are on the right track.  



Any and all suggestions, ideas, contributions, etc. would be awesome.

Todd,

This is fantastic and will help facilitate good conversation.

What level of audience should this be aimed at? I vote "low-tech
consumers" but I'm super flexible.  I'd like to hand this to my mom,
seriously.

A few other notes:

Vulnerabilities to Recommendations are not always one to one.  Since we
are aiming at low-tech audience (maybe?) then explaining "why" to do
certain things does not need to be complex or comprehensive.

Super stoked to see this get rolling!

Aloha, Jim

It should, in my mind, be for "low-tech" audiences. I'm thinking folks, like my dad, and even younger kids.



I think there would generally be several recommendations to a given vulnerability. In fact, a vulnerability could be a group of related vulnerabilities.

I agree with the "low-tech consumers" audience. These categories look fantastic so far. I'll start working on developing language for how I think it should be written to hit that audience. I never received information after requesting an account to edit the Wiki, so I will probably just attach my work to an email.



Jim, can you look into anything for me getting a wiki account? I submitted the request and received confirmation of the submission but nothing since then.



Thanks!

Fair point, I'm with you. I say we just rock out the guide in "our"
(security industry) language, and before final publishing we can convert
it into a more consumer friendly language.

Anyhow, I'm really excited to see this activity. This is a chance for
OWASP to reach "all web users" (ie: billions!) if we get this right.

Aloha, Jim

So what are the top ten security vulnerabilities that low tech consumers face and in what order do you rank them? Be interesting to see everyone's different perspective, do we include physical vulnerabilities for example theft of a mobile device and ways of Defence such as full device encryption and or remote wipe or is the list going to purely based on Web based attacks? As we know Web based attacks are constantly changing and for me ranking and having a top ten will need to be quite generic in terms of vulnerabilities and defence but as the list based at novice audiences I suppose that's the best way to approach this. ?I'm so glad to be part of thisthis, ?I hope everyone is excited about this I am, what a fantasticfantastic idea ??

                  So to get the discussion rolling... I have put on
                    the page a list of 10 end user vulnerabilities. They
                    are in no particular order and it was all I have
                    come up with so far. I have started to write a
                    little each week on the description, threats, impact
                    and recommendations for each. Not that this is the
                    way we should go, but I started it for the sake of
                    getting started. It is still in the brain-storming
                    stage, I just felt like I needed to do something
                    each week to move it forward. 

                  
                  

                  
                  I have started mainly by separating the
                    vulnerability and the recommendation. I found that
                    much of what was running through my head was best
                    practices and I needed to work backwards to the
                    vulnerability.

                  
                  

                  
                  Right now it is written from a security
                    professional's perspective. It will need to be
                    re-written at some point for non-technical users. I
                    guess my baseline is, if I can present it to my dad
                    and have him understand, we are on the right track.?

&gt; So what are the top ten security vulnerabilities that low tech consumers face and in what order do you rank them? 



Excellent question. I have come up with 10, but to say if there are the "top" ten would be arguable. If you have a suggestion on something that should be there, add it. While we are brainstorming, we can expand the list to greater then 10 and then the group can settle on the top 10 after we have discussed it.



&gt; Be interesting to see everyone's different perspective, do we include physical vulnerabilities for example theft of a mobile device and ways of Defence such as full device encryption and or remote wipe or is the list going to purely based on Web based attacks?



My personal opinion is to include non-web based attacks. I think for consumers the line is blurred. But that is my opinion.

As we know Web based attacks are constantly changing and for me ranking and having a top ten will need to be quite generic in terms of vulnerabilities and defence but as the list based at novice audiences I suppose that's the best way to approach this.  I'm so glad to be part of thisthis,  I hope everyone is excited about this I am, what a fantasticfantastic idea ??

&gt; I think there would generally be several recommendations to a given vulnerability. In fact, a vulnerability could be a group of related vulnerabilities. 

Fair point, I'm with you. I say we just rock out the guide in "our" (security industry) language, and before final publishing we can convert it into a more consumer friendly language.

Anyhow, I'm really excited to see this activity. This is a chance for OWASP to reach "all web users" (ie: billions!) if we get this right.

I agree with the "low-tech consumers" audience. These categories look fantastic so far. I'll start working on developing language for how I think it should be written to hit that audience. I never received information after requesting an account to edit the Wiki, so I will probably just attach my work to an email.



Jim, can you look into anything for me getting a wiki account? I submitted the request and received confirmation of the submission but nothing since then.



Thanks!

Todd,

This is fantastic and will help facilitate good conversation.

What level of audience should this be aimed at? I vote "low-tech consumers" but I'm super flexible.  I'd like to hand this to my mom, seriously.

A few other notes:

Vulnerabilities to Recommendations are not always one to one.  Since we are aiming at low-tech audience (maybe?) then explaining "why" to do certain things does not need to be complex or comprehensive.

Super stoked to see this get rolling!



Aloha, Jim

Each week I am attempting to look at one of the vulnerabilities we have listed. Last week I looked at "Weak Password Handling". Could everyone take a look at it and offer suggestions?



Specifically:



1) Is the vulnerability name OK?

2) Language aside, what is missing from the Description?

3) Language aside, what is missing from the Threats?

4) Language aside, what is missing from the Impacts?

5) Language aside, what is missing from the recommendations?



While we are looking at it, is this really the best format for our initial brainstorming?



Thanks



Description:Passwords are the most common way to authenticate to systems, applications, services, etc. Authentication is how a person or system proves their identity. Three methods of authentications are: provide something you know, something you have, or something you are. Passwords fulfill the first condition, something you know. People and systems authenticate by providing something only they should know, therefore proving their identity. Weak password handling vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the handling, storage, and use of passwords. 

Threats:The exposure of passwords through mishandling or improper storage could allow discovery and use by a third party. 

Impact:Weak password handling can result in the unauthorized access and compromise of data or systems. 

Recommendations:

Use Multi-factor Authentication, especially on important accounts 

Use a Password Manager 

Use Strong Passwords 

Avoid using the same password across different accounts 

Do not answer security questions with easily identifiable or enumerable answers 

Do not allow browsers to store passwords 

Do not share your passwords 

Change default passwords

I like it. A good start.

I would beef up the Threats section with language around the storage part. Improper storage can lead to discovery of ALL passwords, which is a major no-no (penalties up to 4% gross revenue under new EU regulation). Should there also be language around proper hashing, salting, and password rotation? Basically flesh out, or link to, good password policy?

I would also include language for password policy.

For recommendations:

  *   Add: Consider using federation instead. Federation moves the authentication to a different system (Facebook, google, active directory) thereby reducing password reuse and password management.
  *   Subtract: "Do not allow browsers to store passwords"
     *   This seems subjective and I'm not sure that the majority of the security community would agree with that statement.

Thanks David. Good suggestions.



This top ten list if for end users, not the web application owner or developer. That may change the perspective. As an application developer, we craft policies or implement controls because we do not aways trust our users to behave securely. This top ten, in my mind, is to educate the end user to protect themselves and not always rely on the security of a given site. 



When we speak of storage in this context, we are speaking more to "Don't write your password down" or "Don't save your password in a document or email"



For password policy, it might be along the lines of "no matter what the site's password policy is, use long, difficult to guess passwords."



And you are correct, we would want to tell them "No matter how convenient it is to let your browser store your password, don't. Ever. Or else." Or something along those lines.

and especially her electronic security.

I agree, I think one of the last edit passes is to change the language
to fit the audience.  This will be a challenge but we can do it. These
conversations are getting deep and I think were ready to move to Google
docs. I'll do this right after the July 4th holiday. Cool?

Hello from AppSecEu, if any of you are here let me know and we can chat
in person.

My take is minimize vulnerability discussion and just focus on the best
practices for the cheat sheet. Remember, non tech consumers. ie: mom.

I think we should publish both a cheat sheet and a comprehensive guide.
For the guide, a deeper discussion is prudent - but it will be a
challenge not to overwhelm my mom. Just my take. :)

I also like simple stuff here. Just call it "Password Handling" to make
it easier to message to non tech folks. My mom has no idea what
"vulnerability" means outside of emotions. :)

Aloha, Jim
