Gunnar,

Thank you for these edit suggestions. I added you as a contributor and 
added your comments in these edits.

If you would like to suggest anything to clean up or expand on this, 
just let me know.

Aloha,
Jim

The SAML protocol is rarely the vector of choice, though its important to have cheatsheets to make sure that this is robust. The various endpoints are more targeted, so how the SAML token is generated and how it is consumed are both important in practice.
