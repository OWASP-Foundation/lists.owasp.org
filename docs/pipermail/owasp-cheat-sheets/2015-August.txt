Subject: [OWASP-cheat-sheets] REST Security Cheat Sheet - Farming?
Message-ID: <CACWUwBzkuDLre5-ae4tXp5171C0hx4QxCSkzFfBUtLfy699e1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

In REST Security Cheat Sheet (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet#Anti-farming), it
defines countermeasures against farming (Anti-Farming). I would like to
understand more about farming in this context, and so far what I've found on
the internet is information related to cluster servers and fake websites.
appreciate in advance whether this threat quoted sources and / or attack on Web
services.

Best regards

Beto C.

Anti-farming is a defensive strategy to stop attackers from scraping 
data off your webservices in high volume.

For example, attackers may scrape pricing data from a e-commerce sire or 
chip prices from a wholesales chip manufacturer.

The bottom line is - if you are listing prices in non-authenticated 
pages or resources, there is nothing you can do to effectively stop data 
farming. You need these resources protected under good authentication to 
even get started in an anti-farming strategy.

Aloha,
Jim
