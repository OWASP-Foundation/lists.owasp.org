<PRE>I am resending since this discussion was blocked by the mailing list.
Jim suggested that this may be because the payload got too long.

TL;DR I agree that, in a broad sense, there may be a session when a
client invokes an access controlled REST service, but the session is
*not* between the client and REST service.

+ REST services hold state of the resources they represent. In that
sense they are stateful. But they do not establish sessions with their
clients. In that sense they are stateless.
+ In order to control access to its resources, REST services may
require a security token to be sent with each request.
+ The security token may have been issued within the scope of a
session between client and STS.
+ A security token may be self-contained or 'reference'. In the latter
case, the relying party, i.c. the REST service, needs to dereference
the token. I would not recommend this because of the additional
round-trip delay, but this architecture does *not* introduce a session
between client and REST service. The session is between, on the one
hand, the client and, on the other, STS and associated services. You
could indeed see a reference token as an ID of that session.
+ OAuth 2.0 does not standardize tokens. It allows both self-contained
and reference tokens. I often use JWTs as OAuth 2.0 access tokens.
