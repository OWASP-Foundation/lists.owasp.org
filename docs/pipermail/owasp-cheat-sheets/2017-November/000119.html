<PRE>Hello Zaur,

Thanks you for your email.

Contributor are welcome.

Please find below the key points that all cheat sheets (called CS) must
provides:

1) Address a single topic (ex: password storage, os command injection,
REST service, csrf, html5 new features security...).

2) Be concise and focused, a cheat sheet must be directly actionable (a
CS is not a guide) and must directly be useful for a developer.

3) Do not re-address topic handled by others cs (in this case target cs
can be enhanced with missing points).

4) When applicable, provide solution proposal implementation through a
full documented POC on a public well know git repository (ex: github is
prefered), the POC can be used as a &quot;playground&quot; for a developer wanting
to play/evaluate your solution proposal.

A CS must have these sections:

1) Introduction:
Describe the topic adressed by the cs and the security issues bring by
the topic.

2) How to address the issues:
Describe how the issues presented in section 1 can be adressed in a
possible technology agnostic approach.

3) Solution proposal implementation:
In this section, using your POC, you describe your solution proposal in
the more teaching possible way.

So, to start:

1) Take a copy of the CS that you want to enhance (mediawiki syntax in
the source tab),

2) Add your enhancement and publish the updated cs on the same github
repo than your POC (it support the mediawiki syntax).

3) Notify us using this mailing list and we will start to review your
contribution.

4) After final validation, we will help you to have right access to the
wiki and update the cs.


Thanks in advance for your understanding.
Regards

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a couple of suggestions to improve cheat sheets towards supporting rails developers better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me first quickly introduce myself, as I am new to this list. My name is Zaur - &#1047;&#1072;&#1091;&#1088; - [za-&#250;&#250;-r], I work as a 'security guy' in a QA group of genua.de. I have some programming experience with the newest rails platform, and basic understanding of web security. Here is my site: <A HREF="https://molotnikov.de">https://molotnikov.de</A> - in case you want to come in touch directly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now to the business. There are two things I'd like to propose: improving/extending the rails cheat sheet, and creating a new cheat sheet 'Secure deployment of a Rails app'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Improving the rails cheat sheet is rather straightforward. Therefore I'd like to *get writing permissions* to the wiki and simply do it. What I will introduce: one example of using devise right, a mention of zxcvbn gem and improving its usability, an example of using cancancan with a couple of notes, some info about omniauth, infos about creating secure api-only apps, devise token auth for this purpose, xsrf protection in api-only apps, some infos on jwt and client-side sessions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second endeavor to create a secure deployment cheat sheet is much harder to get right. That is why I'd like to ask you to do a couple of iterations on the new material with me, before we publish. Below is what I'd like to write about. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are multiple ways to deploy a rails app. Many of them are error prone. Special techniques and server hardening is required to get it right. In this cheat sheet I'd list concerns arising when deploying to a fresh new server. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We start with rules to configure os users. Next, we show, how to hide sensitive data from the unauthorized access. Tuning the app towards web security follows. We continue with rights and deployment management. As an example, I'd build from scratch an nginx with passenger and deploy there. Keeping all the system's components updated while keeping the system up and running is also a challenge to security and availability, a few words on it shall be said. Automated deployment techniques, Capistrano, and monitoring the server shall conclude this guide.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To summarize on the action items to support my initiatives:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) who could grant me the write access to the rails cheat sheet? - I need to request a write access there.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) what is the right way to start a new cheat sheet? - where could I write the first iteration?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think of my proposals?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks a lot for reading it all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Zaur.
</I>&gt;<i>
