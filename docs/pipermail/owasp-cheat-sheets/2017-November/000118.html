<PRE>Hello all,

I have a couple of suggestions to improve cheat sheets towards supporting rails developers better.

Let me first quickly introduce myself, as I am new to this list. My name is Zaur - &#1047;&#1072;&#1091;&#1088; - [za-&#250;&#250;-r], I work as a 'security guy' in a QA group of genua.de. I have some programming experience with the newest rails platform, and basic understanding of web security. Here is my site: <A HREF="https://molotnikov.de">https://molotnikov.de</A> - in case you want to come in touch directly.

Now to the business. There are two things I'd like to propose: improving/extending the rails cheat sheet, and creating a new cheat sheet 'Secure deployment of a Rails app'.

Improving the rails cheat sheet is rather straightforward. Therefore I'd like to *get writing permissions* to the wiki and simply do it. What I will introduce: one example of using devise right, a mention of zxcvbn gem and improving its usability, an example of using cancancan with a couple of notes, some info about omniauth, infos about creating secure api-only apps, devise token auth for this purpose, xsrf protection in api-only apps, some infos on jwt and client-side sessions.

The second endeavor to create a secure deployment cheat sheet is much harder to get right. That is why I'd like to ask you to do a couple of iterations on the new material with me, before we publish. Below is what I'd like to write about. 

There are multiple ways to deploy a rails app. Many of them are error prone. Special techniques and server hardening is required to get it right. In this cheat sheet I'd list concerns arising when deploying to a fresh new server. 

We start with rules to configure os users. Next, we show, how to hide sensitive data from the unauthorized access. Tuning the app towards web security follows. We continue with rights and deployment management. As an example, I'd build from scratch an nginx with passenger and deploy there. Keeping all the system's components updated while keeping the system up and running is also a challenge to security and availability, a few words on it shall be said. Automated deployment techniques, Capistrano, and monitoring the server shall conclude this guide.

To summarize on the action items to support my initiatives:
1) who could grant me the write access to the rails cheat sheet? - I need to request a write access there.
2) what is the right way to start a new cheat sheet? - where could I write the first iteration?


What do you think of my proposals?

Thanks a lot for reading it all.


Best Regards,
Zaur.
