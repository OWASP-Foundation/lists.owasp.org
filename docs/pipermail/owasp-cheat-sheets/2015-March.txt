Subject: [OWASP-cheat-sheets] OWASP Cheat Sheets Question - Password Hashing
Message-ID: <CAABd0sBOB4KAdRKmRxcEaYNrdcU6_HjSn+M4hW0ByR37JM0=ow@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP Mailing List,

Hello. With regards to password hashing algorithms, it looks like there is
inconsistent advice. It is a bit confusing when making recommendations and
creating prototypes for my applications.

Should I recommend using PBKDF2 for the password hashing algorithm?
Are SHA1/SHA-256 references to stale or outdated documentation?


1. There are references to SHA1 and SHA-256 on this web page:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet

*Only use approved public algorithms such as AES, RSA public key
cryptography, and SHA-256 or better for hashing.*

2. However, this document does not mention anything regarding SHA, AES,
RSA, etc...
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet









*Leverage an adaptive one-way functionAdaptive one-way functions compute a
one-way (irreversible) transform. Each function allows configuration of
?work factor?. Underlying mechanisms used to achieve irreversibility and
govern work factors (such as time, space, and parallelism) vary between
functions and remain unimportant to this discussion.Select:PBKDF2 [*4] when
FIPS certification or enterprise support on many platforms is
required;scrypt [*5] where resisting any/all hardware accelerated attacks
is necessary but support isn?t.bcrypt where PBKDF2 or scrypt support is not
available.*


Thanks in advance for your clarification and/or consideration to this
request.

Kenneth Po

Thank you for your input!

PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt ar the goto algorithms for password storage.

The are referring to hashing in general, not specific to password storage.

I updated this. better?

Hi there,
I have a general remark. To my opinion there are currently some
redundancies between the cryptography storage cheat sheet and the password
storage cheat sheet. Wouldn't it be better to separate more these two cheat
sheets. I would move everything which refers to password storage in
particular to the password storage cheat sheet and would put a general
general reference into the cryptography storage cheat sheet (something
like: for recommendations regarding password storage please see....). In
this way you minimize syncing the two cheat sheets when you change
something and simplify the overall maintenance.

Would do you think?

Best regards,
Thomas

Sure, do you have a wiki account care to take a crack at it?
