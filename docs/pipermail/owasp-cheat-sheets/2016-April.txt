Subject: [OWASP-cheat-sheets] 3rd Party JavaScript Management Cheatsheet
Message-ID: <570C6056.80409@owasp.org>

Hello folks,

Jim Weiler from the OWASP Boston chapter just released a cheatsheet on
3rd party JavaScript management. I think this is a solid and very
interesting piece of work. It address a security concern which many
website operators face.

Take a look, your feedback is - as always - appreciated.

Aloha,
Jim Manico
