Subject: [Owasp-cheat-sheets] Authentication Cheat Sheet - Password length
Message-ID: <20120830080902.9B68CE672D@smtp.hushmail.com>

I was just reading 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet 
Password Length

	Longer passwords provide a greater combination of characters and
consequently make it more difficult for an attacker to guess.

	Important applications: Minimum of 6 characters in length.

	Critical applications: Minimum of 8 characters in length. (consider
multi-factor authentication)

	Highly critical applications: Consider multi-factor authentication
Isn't that somewhat outdated? I wouldn't recommend minimum 6 character
passwords to any applications. Looking at available evidence I would
recommend the minimum to be nine characters for new applications and
eight for existing.

Good catch and well said. Do you have a sec to fix this on the wiki?
