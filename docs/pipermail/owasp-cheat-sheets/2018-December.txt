Hello all,

I made a change to ?Double Submit Cookie? technique [1]. I added a variant to it which now mitigates well-known security issues with standard ?Double Submit Cookie? technique. So, people can use this technique without any issues. Please let me know if anyone finds any issues within it.

Whenever I get some free time in next 1-2 months, I am planning to include

a)       Details about popular 6-7 web frameworks and the CSRF mitigations implemented by them

b)      Re-organize the page even more better by switching variant of double submit cookie to primary defense (under stateless section) etc.

Happy holidays everyone ?

Hello all,

In order to move forward and deliver something in the project please update the wiki with content from the refactoring from Konakandla Manideep. If there missing points they will be added in another round it is the role of the wiki based usage.

Thanks in advance for your understanding ?

Hey Folks ?

Good conversation :) Can you guys review the new cheat sheet once? I am sure most of the discussion going on here is already answered in the new re-factored cheat sheet I wrote.

@Pankaj ? Go through the respective sections in the new cheat sheet. If they are not clear / you are not convinced, we can discuss more. Below is the summary of my response to your questions (you will find the same gist going through the cheat sheet as well).

Go through [2] to understand more detailed on how flash based bypass on CSRF custom mitigation defense works. You can see there that the origin headers are passed along with the custom headers and hence current wiki asks to do origin and/or referrer header check as defense-in-depth (it would help even if flash sometime in the future repeats same mistake and forwards custom headers without crossdomain.xml checks. Domain requesting the redirected request might be fooled with custom header bypass but not the origin header check). If both these checks are done, it is indeed a good defense but origin header is not always included etc. (just as Jim mentioned and also as new cheatsheet mentions).  I don?t think deprecating custom header check is a good idea. It is indeed a good solution for stateless services though they have to keep issues like I mentioned before in mind. Your statement of custom header itself doesn?t mitigate CSRF relies on the fact that ?Flash being vulnerable to same bug again in future?. We cannot rely on a future statement and deprecate a technique, instead providing defense in depth measure for it and also cautioning users about past issues might be good idea. Users can take their call. Please read custom headers and origin check sections I re-wrote for more in-details. It talks about the issues and people can select if they want to use it or not.

Also, Login CSRF has nothing to do with custom header mitigation. Login forms are usually handled on <form> tags and custom header mitigation is only applicable on ajax calls because you cannot set custom headers on form tags. It can be applicable if you are doing logins on Ajax/XHR requests in which case my above response from custom header mitigation applies. I also proposed few methods for mitigating login CSRF which aligns with our primary defense on the new cheatsheet (tokens). Please review it as well.

Also, CORS has nothing to do with CSRF. I infact added CORS as a technique that should not be used/even thought for CSRF in the new cheatsheet I wrote. Please check that and also read [1]

[1] https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2017/september/common-csrf-prevention-misconceptions/
[2] https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/flash-307-redirect-game-over/

BTW - Here is the link to the new cheat sheet - https://tinyurl.com/y7k9fded

Again,  I you are not convinced ? please let me know specific item and we can happily discuss further ? Alternatively, you can send us your edits here for review and if it looks good for everyone ? you can edit it in the wiki.

With XSS, even CSRF tokens can be stolen :).
But I'll keep your tip in mind when editing the wiki. I'm planning to do that sometime this month.

I agree JWT's architectures where cookies are not involved are resistant to CSRF but those tokens are at the risk of being stolen over XSS!

The Origin header does not go with all requests and FireFox does not fully support it yet. So careful!

I agree and that's why I would like to propose deprecation of 'custom header approach' as a CSRF defense.
Presently the mechanism that seems to work across applications is validating custom header as well as a forbidden header name (that cannot be set by a software or a program) e.g. Origin. If we want to give it a new name like 'Double Header Validation' or something else, I'm fine with that but custom header alone doesn't seem sufficient to mitigate CSRF issue.

There are some other best practices that should also be considered. I think CORS is now mature enough to have a mention in the CSRF defense Also, applications utilizing JWT token in the header seem immune to CSRF.

Please let me know what you guys think and if allowed, I can go ahead and make some of these edits for your perusal.

Good question, I think it's more a point about to be consistent in terms of CSRF check across the application. Indeed, if you begin to perform different kind of CSRF check depending on the feature of the application (login, business feature, reset password...) it becomes risky and you significantly increase the chance to include location in which you will have a CSRF check weakness...

Yeah. My understanding of the breadth of exploitation of XSS in an application protected with just origin/referrer and other application protected with just token based mitigation earlier was wrong. Dominique earlier email thread cleared that to me (breadth of exploitation is same in both the cases. i.e., if an XSS vulnerability is found in any individual application protected with only one of those techniques, it still can exploit all state changing operations on entire application [though the complexity of exploitation is easy in origin/referrer check than token based mitigation]).

Anyway, I am all clear and also almost done with re-factoring the cheatsheet  [1] ? Should be fully completed by Friday unless something comes up meanwhile. I will then send it to my colleagues for review and then for Legal, PR approvals. Before that, I need help from you guys on below items

b. Added CSRF mitigation myths (CORS, content-type validation etc.)
c. Added a section called ?Not so popular CSRF mitigations? (mentioned details about triple submit cookie)
d. Included limitations / issues associated with double submit cookie, same site cookie, captcha as a CSRF defense etc.
e. Removed lot of obsolete content and added some new content to some of the mitigations
f. Made document look more better by adding RFC?s links wherever possible and lot of other minor changes.

Well tokens can be placed in cookies.

The real answer to avoid CSRF is tokens in JavaScript variable as opposed to cookies. They are not automatically sent and indeed make CSRF impossible - at the expense of tokens being fully stolen via XSS. Pick your poison!

I recommend a COMBO of these defenses. For web apps, sychronizer token + header verification + re-authentication for sensitive features.

For API's double-cookie submit or just use JavaScript variable based tokens + header verification for same-site API's + re-authentication for sensitive features.

Yeah, I understand that any XSS and CSRF game is over but I am stressing out on the highlighted part in [1]. I am trying to highlight and get an affirmation on why my understanding on token based mitigation is better than origin/referrer header check will also apply to ?token based mitigation Vs custom header mitigation (if static tokens are used in custom headers)?.

In case of tokens, we have an option to use different tokens on each page (taking things like URL, timestamp etc. into consideration) and hence XSS vulnerability on one page will only make state changing operations in that page vulnerable to CSRF but not state changing operations on other pages within that domain (because token value is different) but whereas in origin/referrer header check and custom header check, the token value is constant and hence XSS vulnerability in one page will also cause state changing operations in other pages to be vulnerable to CSRF as well. Off course, this can be mitigated in custom header checks by adding tokens to custom headers rather than static constant but this cannot be mitigated in origin/referrer check because those headers cannot be modified. So, yeah a single XSS any CSRF is bypassed but the breadth of the impact is different for each of them.

Regarding code samples ? I currently was able to allocate only some time for this task and I don?t think I will be able to do code samples within this time frame. I am also leaving for a long vacation starting Oct 12 and hence let?s try to get this out first and we can add code samples later on considering my work load after I return from vacation.

Hi,

Thanks for your contribution.

I like very much your plan ?

I ask for some favor in addition :
- can you provide code sample (in one language like java or .net or the one you want but it must be easy to read and understand) or libraires along your proposal for each section?
- can you use the syntaxhighlight tag for code?

I'am agree with Jim, XSS  means game over because your browsing context can be used as proxy so csrf protection will be defeated because request came from the legitimate user.

Thanks you again for all your help ???

Hey Guys,

[1] is what I said for origin/referrer header check in this e-mail thread. I also believe that this applies for custom headers for AJAX endpoints as well. If there is an XSS vulnerability at a single place on a domain (it can add custom header), it can be used to make CSRF on all other state changing operations within that domain done to that AJAX endpoint. Do you agree?

Here is how I am keeping the new re-factored cheatsheet. Does this look good to you guys?


1.       Use token based method as primary defense

a.       Can use synchronizer pattern for stateful applications

b.       Can use hah based/ encryption based token pattern for stateless applications

2.       Defense in depth measures along with drawbacks of each one

a.       Origin/referrer header check

b.       Double submit cookie

c.       Samesite cookie

d.       Custom headers (people still need to use tokens for forms etc. if they have mix of ajax endpoints and general HTML)

3.       Strong CSRF defenses but very less usable : captcha etc.

4.       CSRF Myths / techniques that do not work section

[1] if we solely rely on origin/referrer header check - an XSS vulnerability within a single page on that domain will also give CSRF vulnerability to all other state changing operations under that entire domain.

Ok, I received necessary approvals for working on this. I am hoping to start the work in 2 weeks and then deliver the document to you guys for review by end of September/1st week of October (might be 1-2 weeks delay if approvals from Legal and other teams get delayed). My plan is to work on below things ? Please let me know if I missed anything/you feel something else has to be added to this list.


1.       Change the order of primary and defense in depth measures

2.       Include the pitfalls/caveats for each CSRF mitigation technique (origin/referrer header, samesite, double submit cookie etc.)

3.       Re-structure entire page and remove outdated/ non-relevant stuff

Hello Manideep,

Thanks you for the update.

For info we will migrate the entire project content (unless the homepage) to github so it is possible that you need to also made the update on the github repository.

The migration work will start on January, i will take some rest until January, i really need it.

Thanks you very much for your help on this project :)

Happy holidays too

Hello all,

I made a change to ?Double Submit Cookie? technique [1]. I added a variant to it which now mitigates well-known security issues with standard ?Double Submit Cookie? technique. So, people can use this technique without any issues. Please let me know if anyone finds any issues within it.

Whenever I get some free time in next 1-2 months, I am planning to include

a)       Details about popular 6-7 web frameworks and the CSRF mitigations implemented by them

b)      Re-organize the page even more better by switching variant of double submit cookie to primary defense (under stateless section) etc.

Happy holidays everyone ?

Hello all,

In order to move forward and deliver something in the project please update the wiki with content from the refactoring from Konakandla Manideep. If there missing points they will be added in another round it is the role of the wiki based usage.

Thanks in advance for your understanding ?

Hey Folks ?

Good conversation :) Can you guys review the new cheat sheet once? I am sure most of the discussion going on here is already answered in the new re-factored cheat sheet I wrote.

@Pankaj ? Go through the respective sections in the new cheat sheet. If they are not clear / you are not convinced, we can discuss more. Below is the summary of my response to your questions (you will find the same gist going through the cheat sheet as well).

Go through [2] to understand more detailed on how flash based bypass on CSRF custom mitigation defense works. You can see there that the origin headers are passed along with the custom headers and hence current wiki asks to do origin and/or referrer header check as defense-in-depth (it would help even if flash sometime in the future repeats same mistake and forwards custom headers without crossdomain.xml checks. Domain requesting the redirected request might be fooled with custom header bypass but not the origin header check). If both these checks are done, it is indeed a good defense but origin header is not always included etc. (just as Jim mentioned and also as new cheatsheet mentions).  I don?t think deprecating custom header check is a good idea. It is indeed a good solution for stateless services though they have to keep issues like I mentioned before in mind. Your statement of custom header itself doesn?t mitigate CSRF relies on the fact that ?Flash being vulnerable to same bug again in future?. We cannot rely on a future statement and deprecate a technique, instead providing defense in depth measure for it and also cautioning users about past issues might be good idea. Users can take their call. Please read custom headers and origin check sections I re-wrote for more in-details. It talks about the issues and people can select if they want to use it or not.

Also, Login CSRF has nothing to do with custom header mitigation. Login forms are usually handled on <form> tags and custom header mitigation is only applicable on ajax calls because you cannot set custom headers on form tags. It can be applicable if you are doing logins on Ajax/XHR requests in which case my above response from custom header mitigation applies. I also proposed few methods for mitigating login CSRF which aligns with our primary defense on the new cheatsheet (tokens). Please review it as well.

Also, CORS has nothing to do with CSRF. I infact added CORS as a technique that should not be used/even thought for CSRF in the new cheatsheet I wrote. Please check that and also read [1]

[1] https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2017/september/common-csrf-prevention-misconceptions/
[2] https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/flash-307-redirect-game-over/

BTW - Here is the link to the new cheat sheet - https://tinyurl.com/y7k9fded

Again,  I you are not convinced ? please let me know specific item and we can happily discuss further ? Alternatively, you can send us your edits here for review and if it looks good for everyone ? you can edit it in the wiki.

With XSS, even CSRF tokens can be stolen :).
But I'll keep your tip in mind when editing the wiki. I'm planning to do that sometime this month.

I agree JWT's architectures where cookies are not involved are resistant to CSRF but those tokens are at the risk of being stolen over XSS!

The Origin header does not go with all requests and FireFox does not fully support it yet. So careful!

I agree and that's why I would like to propose deprecation of 'custom header approach' as a CSRF defense.
Presently the mechanism that seems to work across applications is validating custom header as well as a forbidden header name (that cannot be set by a software or a program) e.g. Origin. If we want to give it a new name like 'Double Header Validation' or something else, I'm fine with that but custom header alone doesn't seem sufficient to mitigate CSRF issue.

There are some other best practices that should also be considered. I think CORS is now mature enough to have a mention in the CSRF defense Also, applications utilizing JWT token in the header seem immune to CSRF.

Please let me know what you guys think and if allowed, I can go ahead and make some of these edits for your perusal.

Good question, I think it's more a point about to be consistent in terms of CSRF check across the application. Indeed, if you begin to perform different kind of CSRF check depending on the feature of the application (login, business feature, reset password...) it becomes risky and you significantly increase the chance to include location in which you will have a CSRF check weakness...

Yeah. My understanding of the breadth of exploitation of XSS in an application protected with just origin/referrer and other application protected with just token based mitigation earlier was wrong. Dominique earlier email thread cleared that to me (breadth of exploitation is same in both the cases. i.e., if an XSS vulnerability is found in any individual application protected with only one of those techniques, it still can exploit all state changing operations on entire application [though the complexity of exploitation is easy in origin/referrer check than token based mitigation]).

Anyway, I am all clear and also almost done with re-factoring the cheatsheet  [1] ? Should be fully completed by Friday unless something comes up meanwhile. I will then send it to my colleagues for review and then for Legal, PR approvals. Before that, I need help from you guys on below items

b. Added CSRF mitigation myths (CORS, content-type validation etc.)

d. Included limitations / issues associated with double submit cookie, same site cookie, captcha as a CSRF defense etc.

Well tokens can be placed in cookies.

The real answer to avoid CSRF is tokens in JavaScript variable as opposed to cookies. They are not automatically sent and indeed make CSRF impossible - at the expense of tokens being fully stolen via XSS. Pick your poison!

I recommend a COMBO of these defenses. For web apps, sychronizer token + header verification + re-authentication for sensitive features.

For API's double-cookie submit or just use JavaScript variable based tokens + header verification for same-site API's + re-authentication for sensitive features.

Absolutely!

Yeah, I understand that any XSS and CSRF game is over but I am stressing out on the highlighted part in [1]. I am trying to highlight and get an affirmation on why my understanding on token based mitigation is better than origin/referrer header check will also apply to ?token based mitigation Vs custom header mitigation (if static tokens are used in custom headers)?.

In case of tokens, we have an option to use different tokens on each page (taking things like URL, timestamp etc. into consideration) and hence XSS vulnerability on one page will only make state changing operations in that page vulnerable to CSRF but not state changing operations on other pages within that domain (because token value is different) but whereas in origin/referrer header check and custom header check, the token value is constant and hence XSS vulnerability in one page will also cause state changing operations in other pages to be vulnerable to CSRF as well. Off course, this can be mitigated in custom header checks by adding tokens to custom headers rather than static constant but this cannot be mitigated in origin/referrer check because those headers cannot be modified. So, yeah a single XSS any CSRF is bypassed but the breadth of the impact is different for each of them.

Regarding code samples ? I currently was able to allocate only some time for this task and I don?t think I will be able to do code samples within this time frame. I am also leaving for a long vacation starting Oct 12 and hence let?s try to get this out first and we can add code samples later on considering my work load after I return from vacation.

Hi,

Thanks for your contribution.

I like very much your plan ?

I ask for some favor in addition :
- can you provide code sample (in one language like java or .net or the one you want but it must be easy to read and understand) or libraires along your proposal for each section?
- can you use the syntaxhighlight tag for code?

I'am agree with Jim, XSS  means game over because your browsing context can be used as proxy so csrf protection will be defeated because request came from the legitimate user.

Thanks you again for all your help ???

Any XSS is game over and all CSRF are useless in the face of XSS. I Agree!

Hey Guys,

[1] is what I said for origin/referrer header check in this e-mail thread. I also believe that this applies for custom headers for AJAX endpoints as well. If there is an XSS vulnerability at a single place on a domain (it can add custom header), it can be used to make CSRF on all other state changing operations within that domain done to that AJAX endpoint. Do you agree?

Here is how I am keeping the new re-factored cheatsheet. Does this look good to you guys?


1.       Use token based method as primary defense

a.       Can use synchronizer pattern for stateful applications

b.       Can use hah based/ encryption based token pattern for stateless applications

2.       Defense in depth measures along with drawbacks of each one

a.       Origin/referrer header check

b.       Double submit cookie

c.       Samesite cookie

d.       Custom headers (people still need to use tokens for forms etc. if they have mix of ajax endpoints and general HTML)

3.       Strong CSRF defenses but very less usable : captcha etc.

4.       CSRF Myths / techniques that do not work section

[1] if we solely rely on origin/referrer header check - an XSS vulnerability within a single page on that domain will also give CSRF vulnerability to all other state changing operations under that entire domain.
