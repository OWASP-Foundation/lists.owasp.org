<PRE>No problem. ONe thing I love about being questioned is it causes me to attempt to articulate, which is a skill I need to constantly get better at. :)

Yes, most of these browser password managers are stored as a big text file with minimal protection. That's all I needed - thanks for taking the time to explain.

I'm setting up google docs right now...

With the standard browser function to allow the storing of passwords, it remembers it for anyone who uses the computer. There is not extra authentication required. With a password manager or vault, there is usually a mechanism to authenticate against.



Additionally, the browser password managers I have had experience with store passwords in plain text. Any time you store a password in plain text it is not a great idea. And if they don't store them in plain text, just remembering the password means I could use an interception proxy to steal your password, if I have control of your system.



I understand there is some difficulty in remembering passwords. And in some instances, if you understand the true risk, it is acceptable. However, as long as we have passwords, it is something we will have to deal with. I think the software engineers of the world have an obligation to help users out, I think designers owe it to their users to design better and easier user experiences, but I also think we need to train users to become more aware, which is what this is all about.



That's my $0.02

Why is this? Password managers are really tough for non-tech people to use. Couldn't browser password vaults be a good middle ground?



Or are you concerned that the browser password managers are so terribly insecure in some way?



Aloha, Jim



PS: I largely agree, but am curious as to your reasoning...

So ready to push all of this to Google docs for community editing? I think we're close....

Thanks David. Good suggestions.



This top ten list if for end users, not the web application owner or developer. That may change the perspective. As an application developer, we craft policies or implement controls because we do not aways trust our users to behave securely. This top ten, in my mind, is to educate the end user to protect themselves and not always rely on the security of a given site. 



When we speak of storage in this context, we are speaking more to &quot;Don't write your password down&quot; or &quot;Don't save your password in a document or email&quot;



For password policy, it might be along the lines of &quot;no matter what the site's password policy is, use long, difficult to guess passwords.&quot;



And you are correct, we would want to tell them &quot;No matter how convenient it is to let your browser store your password, don't. Ever. Or else.&quot; Or something along those lines.

I like it. A good start.



I would beef up the Threats section with language around the storage part. Improper storage can lead to discovery of ALL passwords, which is a major no-no (penalties up to 4% gross revenue under new EU regulation). Should there also be language around proper hashing, salting, and password rotation? Basically flesh out, or link to, good password policy?



I would also include language for password policy.



For recommendations:

Add: Consider using federation instead. Federation moves the authentication to a different system (Facebook, google, active directory) thereby reducing password reuse and password management.

Subtract: &quot;Do not allow browsers to store passwords&#8221; 

This seems subjective and I&#8217;m not sure that the majority of the security community would agree with that statement.

Each week I am attempting to look at one of the vulnerabilities we have listed. Last week I looked at &quot;Weak Password Handling&quot;. Could everyone take a look at it and offer suggestions?



Specifically:



1) Is the vulnerability name OK?

2) Language aside, what is missing from the Description?

3) Language aside, what is missing from the Threats?

4) Language aside, what is missing from the Impacts?

5) Language aside, what is missing from the recommendations?



While we are looking at it, is this really the best format for our initial brainstorming?



Thanks



Description:Passwords are the most common way to authenticate to systems, applications, services, etc. Authentication is how a person or system proves their identity. Three methods of authentications are: provide something you know, something you have, or something you are. Passwords fulfill the first condition, something you know. People and systems authenticate by providing something only they should know, therefore proving their identity. Weak password handling vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the handling, storage, and use of passwords. 

Threats:The exposure of passwords through mishandling or improper storage could allow discovery and use by a third party. 

Impact:Weak password handling can result in the unauthorized access and compromise of data or systems. 

Recommendations:

Use Multi-factor Authentication, especially on important accounts 

Use a Password Manager 

Use Strong Passwords 

Avoid using the same password across different accounts 

Do not answer security questions with easily identifiable or enumerable answers 

Do not allow browsers to store passwords 

Do not share your passwords 

Change default passwords
