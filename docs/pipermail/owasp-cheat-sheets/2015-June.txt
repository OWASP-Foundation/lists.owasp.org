Agreed, One of the roadmap items is just that.

projects work from the project summit, because some of topics covered in 
the Authentication Cheat sheet seemed to have been covered in 
discussions that I overheard at the ASVS table at the project summit.

Attached to this email. Also - the link to this is on the ASVS list.

This is a great idea. Can you move your input to the cheat sheet mailing 
list please? Feel free to CC in the task force as well if you want.

 > "Transport Passwords only Over TLS:" should be changed to "Transport 
Passwords only Over TLS or SSH:"?

How about "Transport Passwords only Over TLS or other secure transport?" 
I made this change here.

 > There is also a section on preventing Brute force attacks, should a 
section be added using captcha's and also common techniques used to 
bypass captcha's?

Is this essential information? This is a cheat sheet and I'd like to 
keep it as small as possible. Only the essential stuff! :)

Aloha,
Jim

Message-ID: <557A01E2.5090105@owasp.org>

Thank you to Pawel Krawczyk and Brad Broulik for releasing the first 
version of the OWASP SAML Cheatsheet! Nice work!

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAML_Security_Cheat_Sheet

If you have SAML expertise and would care to review or enhance this 
cheat sheet, please dive in!

Aloha,
Jim

PS: I would also love to get an OAuth and OIDC cheat sheet rolling since 
these are core technologies towards delivering modern delegation and 
federation solutions. If you have solid expertise in one of these areas, 
please drop me a line and lets get these rolling.... :)

James and Gunnar,

Thank you for this astute feedback. I'll give you a shout when we push 
out a few updated related to your suggestions.

Thanks again and more soon.

Aloha,

> Agree with James. Also, suggest adding adding a First Mile Integration and Last Mile integration section. The SAML protocol is rarely the vector of choice, though its important to have cheatsheets to make sure that this is robust. The various endpoints are more targeted, so how the SAML token is generated and how it is consumed are both important in practice.
