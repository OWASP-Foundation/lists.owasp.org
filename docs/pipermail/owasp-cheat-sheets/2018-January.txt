Hi all and Happy New Year!

(Somewhat late, but this is the first time I write here this year).

I just wanted to let you know, that despite the Christmas delay,
I am still working on the RoR cheat sheet improvements.

Today I extended the XSS chapter a bit in the RoR cheat sheet and you
are all welcome to have a look at it.

Some more plans are also there:
1) Continue the TLS story (see below), I haven't yet built my opinion on
this one

2) Continue the token auth story (I have a working prototype now with
devise token auth and angular2 token auth)

3) Issue: the cheat sheet talks a lot about old rails versions,
it makes the cheat sheet large and sometimes irrelevant. Shall we
think of throwing old infos away at some point? (When could we tell
there are not enough Rails 3 and below users for us to keep only
Rails 4 and 5 infos?)

Best regards,
Zaur.

Thank you for your help on the RoR cheasheet!

Rails 4 and 5 infos?)

Yes, is there some way to look at statistics to see how much each type
is used?

Aloha, Jim

Hi all!

During last OWASP Code Sprint I created over 40 secure RoR code examples for OWASP Security Knowledge Framework. We can improve both the cheatsheet and SKF?s examples if you want. I?m open to cooperate ;-)

Cheers,
Wojciech Regu?a

Hi all,

yes, we need indeed some organization for RoR cheat sheet.

Let's try to recognize our common goals first.

Like:
1. Cheat sheet being findable
2. Cheat sheet being concise
3. Cheat sheet being complete
4. Cheat sheet being well suiting the readers groups
...


There is an intuition that cheat sheet shall be concise so that the
visitors can quickly
grab the good solution and go ahead. RoR Cheat Sheet is huge.
But before talking how to cut it, shall we really focus on who
our readers are?

I would start from some kind of statistics, who visits this
RoR Cheat Sheet website generally? Is is popular at all? Are the
visitors new developers? Maybe they are mature programmers?
Same would be to try to learn about their projects. Are they more
heritage and maintenance with RoR or a new development?

What is the difference of this cheat sheet and grabbing a solution
from the StackOverflow (I suppose mature security advise) ?

Maybe we should also think on how to make this list more findable
when people look for solutions and not for security only, e.g. how
do I do authentication in ruby on rails?

OWASP cheat sheet pops up for "Rails authentication secure" on
the 6th place, and on 999th place for "Rails authentication" on google.
Maybe we need a radically different approach of splitting the cheat
sheet in several how-to pages to make it more searchable?

I am looking forward to your opinions about these topics.

Ok, thanks!

I read the 4 points in the content (single topic, concise, do not
repeat, PoC) and think these are recommendation to achieve the goals.

Goals are missing for me still. Shall it be a copy-pasteable solution?
For whom? Shall it be findable better than stack overflow?

(RoR CS also does not follow the recommendations covering over 16 topics
and many rails versions)

You are welcome and thanks you very much for your feedback.

It's true that the 4 points are reco to achieve the goals.

A CS template is provided to help to structure the news CS and try to
"standardize" them (at least for new CS).

Recommendation and template has been proposed recently so many existing CS
don't use these guidelines.

RoR current enhancement task can be the right moment to refactor the
content and the structure.

Splitting of the current RoR CS into several focused RoR topic can be
discussed and then started after a roadmap and work distribution udpdate in
order to keep the project organized.s

hi Tal,

the most important message is: don't send sensitive data in the URL.

Beyond that, should you be sending GET requests with a body? Probably
not. The HTTP spec is very vague whether this is allowed or not. So
even if your server parses the body, (reverse) proxies may not pass it
on, let alone cache it properly.

The example you give does not look like a read operation. POST would
seem more appropriate: create a payment. In this case, a body would be
very much expected and would be the correct place to put the card
number.

hth,

Yo

Adding to that, using GET method in this way violates the HTTP
specification requirement for safety and idempotency in the HTTP meaning
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2 GET should be not used
for any transactional state-changing operations for a number of reasons,
notably because it's automatically executed by browsers (result: CSRF)
and because GET requests may be transparently withheld or repeated by
caches, proxies, browser addons etc.
