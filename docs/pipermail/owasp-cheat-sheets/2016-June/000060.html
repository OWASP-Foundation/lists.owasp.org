<PRE>So to get the discussion rolling... I have put on the page a list of 10 end user vulnerabilities. They are in no particular order and it was all I have come up with so far. I have started to write a little each week on the description, threats, impact and recommendations for each. Not that this is the way we should go, but I started it for the sake of getting started. It is still in the brain-storming stage, I just felt like I needed to do something each week to move it forward. 



I have started mainly by separating the vulnerability and the recommendation. I found that much of what was running through my head was best practices and I needed to work backwards to the vulnerability.



Right now it is written from a security professional's perspective. It will need to be re-written at some point for non-technical users. I guess my baseline is, if I can present it to my dad and have him understand, we are on the right track.  



Any and all suggestions, ideas, contributions, etc. would be awesome.
