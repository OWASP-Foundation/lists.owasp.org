<PRE>I like it. A good start.

I would beef up the Threats section with language around the storage part. Improper storage can lead to discovery of ALL passwords, which is a major no-no (penalties up to 4% gross revenue under new EU regulation). Should there also be language around proper hashing, salting, and password rotation? Basically flesh out, or link to, good password policy?

I would also include language for password policy.

For recommendations:

  *   Add: Consider using federation instead. Federation moves the authentication to a different system (Facebook, google, active directory) thereby reducing password reuse and password management.
  *   Subtract: &quot;Do not allow browsers to store passwords&quot;
     *   This seems subjective and I'm not sure that the majority of the security community would agree with that statement.

Each week I am attempting to look at one of the vulnerabilities we have listed. Last week I looked at &quot;Weak Password Handling&quot;. Could everyone take a look at it and offer suggestions?

Specifically:

1) Is the vulnerability name OK?
2) Language aside, what is missing from the Description?
3) Language aside, what is missing from the Threats?
4) Language aside, what is missing from the Impacts?
5) Language aside, what is missing from the recommendations?

While we are looking at it, is this really the best format for our initial brainstorming?

Thanks


Description:Passwords are the most common way to authenticate to systems, applications, services, etc. Authentication is how a person or system proves their identity. Three methods of authentications are: provide something you know, something you have, or something you are. Passwords fulfill the first condition, something you know. People and systems authenticate by providing something only they should know, therefore proving their identity. Weak password handling vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the handling, storage, and use of passwords.

Threats:The exposure of passwords through mishandling or improper storage could allow discovery and use by a third party.

Impact:Weak password handling can result in the unauthorized access and compromise of data or systems.

Recommendations:

  *   Use Multi-factor Authentication, especially on important accounts
  *   Use a Password Manager
  *   Use Strong Passwords
  *   Avoid using the same password across different accounts
  *   Do not answer security questions with easily identifiable or enumerable answers
  *   Do not allow browsers to store passwords
  *   Do not share your passwords
  *   Change default passwords
