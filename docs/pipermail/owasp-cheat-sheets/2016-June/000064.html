<PRE>So what are the top ten security vulnerabilities that low tech consumers face and in what order do you rank them? Be interesting to see everyone's different perspective, do we include physical vulnerabilities for example theft of a mobile device and ways of Defence such as full device encryption and or remote wipe or is the list going to purely based on Web based attacks? As we know Web based attacks are constantly changing and for me ranking and having a top ten will need to be quite generic in terms of vulnerabilities and defence but as the list based at novice audiences I suppose that's the best way to approach this. &#160;I'm so glad to be part of thisthis, &#160;I hope everyone is excited about this I am, what a fantasticfantastic idea &#128077;&#128077;

    &gt; I think there would generally be several recommendations to
      a given vulnerability. In fact, a vulnerability could be a group
      of related vulnerabilities. 

    
    Fair point, I'm with you. I say we just rock out the guide in
      &quot;our&quot; (security industry) language, and before final publishing we
      can convert it into a more consumer friendly language.
    Anyhow, I'm really excited to see this activity. This is a chance
      for OWASP to reach &quot;all web users&quot; (ie: billions!) if we get this
      right.
    Aloha, Jim

        It should, in my mind, be for &quot;low-tech&quot; audiences. I'm

                I agree with the &quot;low-tech consumers&quot; audience.
                  These categories look fantastic so far. I'll start
                  working on developing language for how I think it
                  should be written to hit that audience. I never
                  received information after requesting an account to
                  edit the Wiki, so I will probably just attach my work
                  to an email.

                
                

                
                Jim, can you look into anything for me getting a
                  wiki account? I submitted the request and received
                  confirmation of the submission but nothing since then.

                
                

                
                Thanks!

                Todd,

                
                This is fantastic and will help facilitate good
                  conversation.

                
                What level of audience should this be aimed at? I
                  vote &quot;low-tech consumers&quot; but I'm super flexible.&#160; I'd
                  like to hand this to my mom, seriously.

                
                A few other notes:

                
                Vulnerabilities to Recommendations are not always one
                  to one.&#160; Since we are aiming at low-tech audience
                  (maybe?) then explaining &quot;why&quot; to do certain things
                  does not need to be complex or comprehensive.

                
                Super stoked to see this get rolling!

                  So to get the discussion rolling... I have put on
                    the page a list of 10 end user vulnerabilities. They
                    are in no particular order and it was all I have
                    come up with so far. I have started to write a
                    little each week on the description, threats, impact
                    and recommendations for each. Not that this is the
                    way we should go, but I started it for the sake of
                    getting started. It is still in the brain-storming
                    stage, I just felt like I needed to do something
                    each week to move it forward. 

                  
                  

                  
                  I have started mainly by separating the
                    vulnerability and the recommendation. I found that
                    much of what was running through my head was best
                    practices and I needed to work backwards to the
                    vulnerability.

                  
                  

                  
                  Right now it is written from a security
                    professional's perspective. It will need to be
                    re-written at some point for non-technical users. I
                    guess my baseline is, if I can present it to my dad
                    and have him understand, we are on the right track.&#160;
                    

                  
                  

                  
                  Any and all suggestions, ideas, contributions,
                    etc. would be awesome.

                        Hello,

                        
                        A group of folk are working on a Consumer
                              best practice security guide for
                          the web.&#160; This may migrate into a top ten,
                          cheatsheet or both. 

                        
                        Here is the wiki page being worked on:

                        
                        <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Consumer_Best_Practices">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Consumer_Best_Practices</A>

                        
                        I also CC'ed in some of the folks who got
                          this off the ground. (Thank you Todd, Pax and
                          Anthony)

                        
                        My goal is for everyone to spend the next few
                          weeks discussing and researching, meet to
                          establish the initial list after July 5th, and
                          then move to google docs for final polishing,
                          feedback and editing after we have the initial
                          rough list established.

                        
                        Sound good?

                        
                        Aloha all, Jim
