<PRE>&gt;<i>  this is excellent for the likes of us, I think it will have to be
</I>'dumbed' down quite considerably for the likes of my missus to
understand as she is in our target audience not being too savvy on IT
and especially her electronic security.

I agree, I think one of the last edit passes is to change the language
to fit the audience.  This will be a challenge but we can do it. These
conversations are getting deep and I think were ready to move to Google
docs. I'll do this right after the July 4th holiday. Cool?

Hello from AppSecEu, if any of you are here let me know and we can chat
in person.

Aloha, Jim

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Todd,
</I>&gt;<i>                this is excellent for the likes of us, I think it will
</I>&gt;<i> have to be 'dumbed' down quite considerably for the likes of my missus
</I>&gt;<i> to understand as she is in our target audience not being too savvy on
</I>&gt;<i> IT and especially her electronic security.  You seem to have hit most
</I>&gt;<i> points regarding password security, would like to mention one other
</I>&gt;<i> point and that's social engineering in terms of where the password is
</I>&gt;<i> stored, for example written on a piece of paper slipped under the
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard or in a desk draw and also how you construct memorable
</I>&gt;<i> passwords and not using anything that can be easily socially
</I>&gt;<i> engineered via facebook, twitter, electoral roll, etc, - kids
</I>&gt;<i> names/birthdays, correct spelling, use of numbers instead of letters
</I>&gt;<i> eg- l3tt3r5 instead of letters, sound good? But yes like this format
</I>&gt;<i> very good well done.  Perhaps 'weak password handling' is a bit of a
</I>&gt;<i> mouth full for the lay person how about something easier when
</I>&gt;<i> publishing? of the like 'password security' 'my passwords' 'safe
</I>&gt;<i> password' 'secure your passwords' 'password safety' ? Not much missing
</I>&gt;<i> from the description and again though would consider dumbing it down
</I>&gt;<i> quite a lot and perhaps give it more impact by making it sound scary
</I>&gt;<i> in terms of how important passwords of being hacked and losing your
</I>&gt;<i> data?? To the threats I would consider again looking at a threat from
</I>&gt;<i> a novices view point for example if you were to ask someone new to IT
</I>&gt;<i> what the biggest threat to password compromise they may not see
</I>&gt;<i> 'improper storage' as a threat but informing them that if their
</I>&gt;<i> house/office were broken into would it be easy to find there
</I>&gt;<i> passwords? where do they store their passwords? do they have them
</I>&gt;<i> written down? this type of thing.  We know that improper storage is is
</I>&gt;<i> an excellent example of a threat to password handling but would you
</I>&gt;<i> Grandmother? Again with the impact great definition for us but is the
</I>&gt;<i> best for little Mrs Miggins down the road? perhaps something like -
</I>&gt;<i> loss of passwords could lead to someone hacking your bank account,
</I>&gt;<i> using your credit cards, that type of thing? Recommendations are great
</I>&gt;<i> but again I think the the language used will have to played with on to
</I>&gt;<i> make my missus understand so when we say Multi factor authentication
</I>&gt;<i> what we really mean is a strong password and for example on your phone
</I>&gt;<i> fingerprint scanner as a second factor. Hope you find my input useful
</I>&gt;<i> and I am I doing the right thing?  Thanks very much again for
</I>&gt;<i> including me, great work!! Keep it up buddy!!!

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Each week I am attempting to look at one of the vulnerabilities we
</I>&gt;<i> have listed. Last week I looked at &quot;Weak Password Handling&quot;. Could
</I>&gt;<i> everyone take a look at it and offer suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is the vulnerability name OK?
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Language aside, what is missing from the Description?
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Language aside, what is missing from the Threats?
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Language aside, what is missing from the Impacts?
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Language aside, what is missing from the recommendations?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> While we are looking at it, is this really the best format for our
</I>&gt;<i> initial brainstorming?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Description:*Passwords are the most common way to authenticate to
</I>&gt;<i> systems, applications, services, etc. Authentication is how a person
</I>&gt;<i> or system proves their identity. Three methods of authentications are:
</I>&gt;<i> provide something you know, something you have, or something you are.
</I>&gt;<i> Passwords fulfill the first condition, something you know. People and
</I>&gt;<i> systems authenticate by providing something only they should know,
</I>&gt;<i> therefore proving their identity. Weak password handling
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the handling, storage, and use of
</I>&gt;<i> passwords.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Threats:*The exposure of passwords through mishandling or improper
</I>&gt;<i> storage could allow discovery and use by a third party.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Impact:*Weak password handling can result in the unauthorized access
</I>&gt;<i> and compromise of data or systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Recommendations:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Use Multi-factor Authentication, especially on important accounts
</I>&gt;<i>   * Use a Password Manager
</I>&gt;<i>   * Use Strong Passwords
</I>&gt;<i>   * Avoid using the same password across different accounts
</I>&gt;<i>   * Do not answer security questions with easily identifiable or
</I>&gt;<i>     enumerable answers
</I>&gt;<i>   * Do not allow browsers to store passwords
</I>&gt;<i>   * Do not share your passwords
</I>&gt;<i>   * Change default passwords
</I>&gt;<i>
