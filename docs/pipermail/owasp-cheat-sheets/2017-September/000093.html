<PRE>Jim,

I have removed the 2 sections you object to (point 2 and 3). Your
criticism is fair. The important points to make here, I think, is that
there should be a separate component responsible for authentication
(an IdP) and passing credentials through the service provider is
unnecessary and undesirable - use an STS instead. I try to make these
points in a new section: Externalising the Security Token Service and
Identity Provider.

I have also added the lack of a mechanism to log the user out as a
drawback of Basic/Digest Authentication. What is this 'session' thing
that you speak of?

&gt;<i> I like where you're going with this Yo. A few comments...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) One of the big issues with HTTP Basic/Digest is that there is no clean
</I>&gt;<i> way to logout the user. You're logged in until the browser closes. There is
</I>&gt;<i> no real session management in play. You're using credentials as session
</I>&gt;<i> identifiers basically - which is a nono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This comment does not seem true to me. Each API endpoint must have access
</I>&gt;<i> to the password database. Effectively, this means that all APIs are part of
</I>&gt;<i> the attack surface. Since a password database is a high-value target, its
</I>&gt;<i> attack surface should be carefully controlled. This becomes almost
</I>&gt;<i> impossible as the number of endpoints grows and the API need to evolve
</I>&gt;<i> quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A webservice could just pass the authentication data to another service that
</I>&gt;<i> does the verification. I have seen this done before using a variety of
</I>&gt;<i> products and architectures. A more accurate comment would be &quot;each API
</I>&gt;<i> endpoint must PROCESS usernames and passwords in some way&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) I also politely disagree with this comment for the same reason as #2.
</I>&gt;<i> Authentication and authorization logic runs on every endpoint. Ideally, this
</I>&gt;<i> would be shared code, subjected to rigorous QA, but this may be difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> realise as distinct API endpoints may have different release cycles. Any
</I>&gt;<i> security patch would impact all endpoints.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> API endpoints could pass these AuthN/Z challenges to another internal
</I>&gt;<i> service (think of the proxy service pattern). I'm not sure how to wordsmith
</I>&gt;<i> this, but does my comment make sense?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aloha, Jim
