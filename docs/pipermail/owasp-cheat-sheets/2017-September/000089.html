<PRE>I like where you're going with this Yo. A few comments...

1) One of the big issues with HTTP Basic/Digest is that there is no
clean way to logout the user. You're logged in until the browser closes.
There is no real session management in play. You're using credentials as
session identifiers basically - which is a nono.

2) This comment does not seem true to me. /*Each API endpoint must have
access to the password database. Effectively, this means that all APIs
are part of the attack surface. Since a password database is a
high-value target, its attack surface should be carefully controlled.
This becomes almost impossible as the number of endpoints grows and the
API need to evolve quickly.*/

A webservice could just pass the authentication data to another service
that does the verification. I have seen this done before using a variety
of products and architectures. A more accurate comment would be &quot;each
API endpoint must /*PROCESS*/ usernames and passwords in some way&quot;.

3) I also politely disagree with this comment for the same reason as
#2./*Authentication and authorization logic runs on every endpoint.
Ideally, this would be shared code, subjected to rigorous QA, but this
may be difficult to realise as distinct API endpoints may have different
release cycles. Any security patch would impact all endpoints.&quot;*/

API endpoints could pass these AuthN/Z challenges to another internal
service (think of the proxy service pattern). I'm not sure how to
wordsmith this, but does my comment make sense?

Aloha, Jim
