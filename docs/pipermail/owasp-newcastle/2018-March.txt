Hello all,

Due to the unprecedented amount of people coming to OWASP next Tuesday 27th
we've had to change room to CCE1 Building, room 402. This is on the 4th
floor of the law building. You can find more information (and a map link)
on
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-march-2018-meetup-tickets-42693611742
.

As a note we currently have 74/75 tickets that have been taken, if you are
not able to sign up for the event but have already got a ticket, please
cancel the ticket to give other people a chance at a ticket and to give us
a better idea of numbers.

Thanks again for attending and I look forward to seeing you all there!

Connor Carr
OWASP Newcastle Co-Founder
