Subject: [Owasp-newcastle] November meeting - TOMORROW
Message-ID: <CAPC7AoEFf9SmLeQ+cPEGOzo3mgNmodsBw__sVDMkfiN9-B9ODQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Just a reminder that our November meeting is tomorrow at our usual venue in
the Ellison Building at Northumbria University. I just found out that the
EventBrite registration page was incorrectly closed, so if you have been
trying to register - sorry! It's open again now at:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-meeting-for-november-tickets-18978007732

Remember - registration is purely optional. You can always just turn up on
the night whether you have registered or not.

Hope to see you there!

Mike

Hello all,

Thank you to everyone who attended the November meeting and special thanks
to our speakers, Ben Lee, Ross Dargan, Michael Haselhurst and Colin Watson.

All the slides are up on the Newcastle Chapter wiki page
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newcastle#Past_Events>.

We are looking at a potential new venue for our next meeting, so the date
may have to change if there is a conflict there. In any case it will be
towards the end of January next year. Details will be shared on the mailing
list as things firm up.

Best regards,

*Mike Goodwin*
