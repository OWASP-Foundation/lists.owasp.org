Subject: [Owasp-newcastle] OWASP Security Shepherd
Message-ID: <CAPC7AoEzB8NRPWG9ULTQcUTmSyhcAQ6+YhJ3+Gh0UWPh6pBswg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Just a quick note to let you know that OWASP Security Shepherd
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd> has graduated
from an OWASP Lab project to a Flagship project. There are only a small
number of Flagship projects and they all meet a demanding set of qualifying
criteria including a good level of activity, proven quality and high level
of adoption within the security community.

OWASP Security Shepherd is an application security training platform that
provides:

   - Teaching Tool for All Application Security
   - Web Application Pen Testing Training
   - Mobile Application Pen Testing Training
   - Safe Playground to Practise AppSec Techniques
   - Real Security Risk Examples

And obviously, because it's OWASP, it is completely free and open source.
If you haven't looked at it before, give it a go!

Also, if anyone would like to have a demo/talk around this project at a
chapter meetup, please let me know and I'll see what I can do.

Subject: [Owasp-newcastle] OWASP maturity models project
Message-ID: <CAPC7AoHK0rF4T7Yp9Z_g6m-KqkvH6z_BZeEwTXib4X7Cw5AB_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Maturity models are a good way of benchmarking your secure development
practises against other people. BSIMM <https://www.bsimm.com/>is a very
popular model and of course, OWASP has its flagship OpenSAMM
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project> project.

If you are assessing yourself against BSIMM or OpenSAMM and need a tool to
track progress against multiple teams, you could give this new project a
test drive:

https://github.com/owasp/Maturity-Models

The team would welcome any feedback you might have!
