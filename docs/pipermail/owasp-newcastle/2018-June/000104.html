<PRE>Hi everyone,

As a reminder we'll be hosting our next event on Tuesday 26th June at
Northumbria University. A few regular attendees have asked questions
regarding the capture the flag event and the format so we have included an
FAQ below. Tickets are available here:
<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-june-2018-capture-the-flag-tickets-43192186994">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-june-2018-capture-the-flag-tickets-43192186994</A>






*What is a CTF?CTF stands for Capture the Flag, the flag in this case being
a file with a randomised string of text, identifying you have captured the
&#8216;flag&#8217;. The aim of this CTF is to capture as many flags as possible,
scoring points for your team.What happens?You will bring your laptop and be
provided with a VPN connection to a vulnerable web application. You will be
given your own teams dedicated instance so no team should be able to
interfere with anyone elses application. We will also provide food and
drink. As well as prizes for the winners.What should I bring?Bring your own
laptop, fully charged, with whatever tools you like. There will be charging
sockets available.But I&#8217;ve never done one before, is it worth me
attending?Yes, this entire event is catered to people who won&#8217;t have
participated in CTF before, you will be more than welcome and will learn a
new skill if you haven&#8217;t been. We will also be on hand to assist anyone who
is particularly struggling with anything. That being said, a great place to
start is the OWASP Top 10
(<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project</A>&gt;) as alot
of these vulnerabilities will be inside the vulnerable application. I don&#8217;t
have a team to joinCome on your own or in teams up to three.I&#8217;m not very
technical, how will I be able to participate? You can team up with
technical people, it may be that you&#8217;ve spotted something that no one else
has. The whole event is catered for a range of skills, not just 1337
hax0rs.*
Thanks,

Andi
