<PRE>Thanks to everyone who's responded across different lists to this call.
I think we can safely say that there are enough people up for it to make
it happen - hurray!

Most of the energy seems to be from the Newcastle area, so I'm going to
suggest that the next stage is for someone in Newcastle to call a
meeting for us to talk face-to-face and make a plan. Past experience
suggests that a midweek meeting somewhere central at about 6PM is good -
does anyone have access to a meeting room they could offer, about a week
from now?

If you're interested in attending, please join up to the ORG-NE mailing
list so we don't have to keep cross-posting, and also note that Alex has
started a useful wiki-page at <A HREF="https://cryptoparty.in/newcastle">https://cryptoparty.in/newcastle</A> where you
can write anything that shouldn't be lost in an email thread.

Looking forward to it!

Mark

&gt;<i> Call-out for help putting on a cryptoparty in Newcastle or Durham
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's some interest in putting on a cryptoparty in May 2016, initially
</I>&gt;<i> being discussed on the Open Rights Group NE list (please subscribe and
</I>&gt;<i> then reply to this message) [1]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of us were involved with one in Durham about 18 months ago [2]. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sending this to our two nearest LUGs as the last one was mostly an
</I>&gt;<i> off-shoot from Durham LUG and wouldn't have happened without their
</I>&gt;<i> support. Also our local makers as I know some of you will be up for it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please let us know if you can help us to organise, decorate, cater,
</I>&gt;<i> promote, do a bit of informal teaching, or just generally increase the
</I>&gt;<i> awesomeness.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Every time I see the snoopers' charter in the news again, I think to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myself, we should put on another cryptoparty.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we have a core of at least four people who want to make it happen,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm sure we can do it. Say sometime in May? I can find a venue in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Durham but am open to someone else finding a venue elsewhere.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone up for it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
