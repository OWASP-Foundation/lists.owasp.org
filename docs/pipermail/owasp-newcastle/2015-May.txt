Hello all,

This is to confirm the May meeting is on 26th May from 6pm to 9pm at the
Ellison Building, room EBA002, Northumbria University.

As always, it is free and there is no need to get a ticket, but it would
help gauge the size of the pizza order if you could register at:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-meeting-for-may-tickets-16936938840

We have one confirmed talk: Robin Fewster on "An introduction to basic
application penetration testing" and another talk TBC.

Hope to see you there!

Mike

Hello all,

In addition to Robin Fewster talking about "An introduction to basic
application penetration testing", we now also have Neil Dixley on "The
Elevation of Privilege Threat Modelling Tool".

"An introduction to threat modelling and using the 'Elevation of Privilege'
card game to facilitate and improve team threat modelling exercises. This
presentation includes a live example of the card game so make sure you
bring your Poker face."

Remember you can just turn up on the night, but it help us gauge likely
