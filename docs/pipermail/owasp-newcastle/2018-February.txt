Hi Everyone,


Firstly thanks for coming out to our first chapter meeting of 2018 last
month, it was a great turnout and one of most popular events for a while.
Trying to keep that momentum we have arranged 2 great talk for our March
event which will be held Tuesday 27th March 6pm at the Northumbria Law
Building.


Details of the two talks and tickets are available on Eventbrite
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-march-2018-meetup-tickets-42693611742


Going forward we?re looking to hold chapter meetings the last Tuesday of
every other month. If anyone has any talk ideas and would like some help
developing their ideas feel free to email me.


Lastly; we?re considering changing the catering and aswell as pizza having
some sandwiches for this event. If anyone has any dietary requirements let
me know, I think we have a few vegetarians so there will be veggie
sandwiches too.


Thanks,


Andi
