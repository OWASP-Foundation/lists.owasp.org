<PRE>Hello all,

I'd like your opinion on an email that came by the OWASP leaders mailing
list - see below. As a chapter, we have funds (not a huge amount, but we
are doing OK). We could use some of them to help this student chapter in
Ukraine, but I wanted to see what the views of our community are, since the
funds are for your benefit really.

If you have a view, one way or the other, let me know by replying either to
the mailing list if you like, or directly to me (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newcastle">mike.goodwin at owasp.org</A>) if
you would rather keep your view private.

Best regards,

Mike


*Hi OWASP Leaders!*

*We received a request for a $200 donation from a chapter or project
allocation to help the Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics
fund the printing of marketing materials and giveaways for their upcoming
events.*




*<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics</A>&gt;Since
student chapters do not qualify for a separate allocation from the
Foundation, we are asking that an OWASP chapter or project volunteer some
funds out of their allocations to help this student chapter. Typically this
would be a local OWASP Chapter, however, KNURE is in Kharkiv, Ukraine and
does not have a local chapter in it's vicinity.*

*If you are interested in helping out, please forward the amount you would
like us to allocate and we can process it toward the KNURE expenses.*


*Hi.*

*I'm leader of OWASP KNURE student chapter. We would like to print some
marketing materials for our chapter to popularize it, but we don't have
enough money to do it. We would like to print: notepads, pens, packets and
stickers. We need around $200-$250 (USD).*

*At the moment student chapters at OWASP are are not eligible for chapter
funding, so we would like to ask the OWASP-leaders for a donation to our
student
chapter:<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics</A>&gt;*

*Thank you for your help and support in advance.*

*--*
*Sincerely yours,*
*Vadym Chakrian.*


*Thanks!*
