Message-ID: <CAPC7AoHUm7TnTAiTWcnri6f5nJt=4Px3M6d8CwTRViS9-mgQHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

The OWASP top 10 proactive controls v2 is released! If you have never come
across it before you should take a look. It is a developer-centric response
to the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities and a very useful resource.

Check it out here:

Best regards,

Many Thanks Mike,
I notice that Regular Expressions are included. Practicing these on a
regular basis nowadays, since they are at the heart of the modsecurity
waf. In fact they turn up everywhere.
Don't know how it is with the meeting venue situation. Thought I'd just
mention that the Discovery Museum is sympathetic to tech based groups.
The Linux folks meet there.

Subject: [Owasp-newcastle] Angular client side template injection
Message-ID: <CAPC7AoHgV2W5vJP0bxoTtf4+zJdj7dH4kj5AGOibLnRvhW2vHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Here is an interesting exploit combines angular template injection and
sandbox escaping. Be wary of curly braces in user input!

Very interesting, thanks Mike. 

Does anyone have a decent scanning tool for  testing AngularJS developments?

A lot of the current tools (including ZAP) can't cope with these newer developments. 

Thanks
Steve
