<PRE>Hi All,

The next (ISC)2 North East England Chapter meeting will be held at Ward Hadaway at the Quayside in Newcastle on Tuesday 9th February

To encourage further networking and collaboration of our chapter members we are going to try something a little different. The event format will use the World Caf&#233; conversational process format, the event hosting as a &quot;Security Caf&#233;&quot;, with our central theme for the evening being &quot;Play your part for a better internet - how we can help as Information Security professionals&quot;. Coffee and biscuits will be included.

The evening event will this time be kindly hosted by Ward Hadaway in their Newcastle Quayside office. To help facilitate the evening we also have a guest world caf&#233; practitioner: Dr Luisa Wakeling is a Stage 1 Director at the School of Dental Sciences at Newcastle University.

Tickets are limited at this event and you are encouraged to register ASAP to avoid missing out. If you register a ticket and are subsequently unable to attend, please login to cancel your ticket so that someone else could take your place.

This meeting is open to non-(ISC)2 members.
