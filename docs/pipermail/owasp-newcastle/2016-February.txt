*PROJECTS: Announcing GSoC 2016, New Releases from OWASP ZSC, ESAPI,
WebGoat 7, and a ZAP User Survey*

*Got an Idea for Google Summer of Code 2016?*

The time of the year has come to propose ideas for GSoC 2016.

We haven't been selected yet, but we need to populate this list of ideas as
part of the organization application process.

We have created a list here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSOC2016_Ideas
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/f385211697/utm_content=mike&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eowasp%2Eorg%2Findex%2Ephp%2FGSOC2016_Ideas&utm_campaign=February%202016%20Community%20News%20Flash>

We have removed last year's ideas and only left some as "example ideas".
Please add more ideas to this list as you wish. You should put your ideas
down before the application deadline, ie before February 19th. You will be
able to add more idea after the deadline but we would like to present to
Google as many ideas as possible.

*OWASP ZSC*

We are preparing to start developing a powerful obfuscation tool OWASP ZSC
and looking for some volunteers to contribute the tool project.

OWASP ZSC Project
OWASP ZSC is an open source software in python language which lets you
generate customized shellcodes and convert scripts to an obfuscated script.
This software can be run on Windows/Linux/OSX under python.

Usage of shellcodes
Shellcodes are small codes in assembly which could be use as the payload in
software exploiting. Other usages are in malwares, bypassing anti viruses,
obfuscated codes and etc.

Usage of Obfuscate Codes
Can be use for bypassing antiviruses, code protections, same stuff etc?

Why use OWASP ZSC ?
According to other shellcode generators such as metasploit tools and etc,
OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect.
OWASP ZSC encoders are able to generate shellcodes with random encodes that
lets you to get thousands of new dynamic shellcodes with the same job in
just a second, it means you will not get a same code if you use random
encodes with same commands, and that makes OWASP ZSC one of the bests!
otherwise it's going to generate shellcodes for other operation systems in
the next versions. It?s the same story for the code obfuscation.

There are more details about how it works and user guides
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/17d4d5d4ac>
and also how to develop
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/1ffdcbd2f7>.


And whole developer and users guide documents are available for download in
gitbooks
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/c70442c62a>

*WebGoat*

Webgoat v.7 released. Listen to our podcast
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/83f302441d>
as Bruce Mayhew explains the new version. The WebGoat Project started 10
years ago and has had over 1,000,000 downloads. Version 7.0 is being
released this week. Matt Miller caught with Bruce Mayhew, project lead, to
talk about the history of the project, what has been updated in version 7,
and what he foresees as the future of this project. Project Page:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/CategorY:OWASP_WebGoat_Project

*New ESAPI Release*

ESAPI project co-leader, Kevin Wall announced his team has just tagged (and
signed) a new ESAPI release. The tag name is esapi-2.1.0.1. There are 36
GitHub issues that were closed. You can find full details at:
https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/master/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.1.0.1-release-notes.txt
.

Note that there are also some important changes made to the GitHub repo
itself. Specifically, we have chosen to adopt a git workflow based on this
blog: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/dd7765f039>,
where all the new development work will be done on the 'develop' branch and
the 'master' branch will henceforth reflect the latest official ESAPI
release.

To accommodate this,

   - The 'develop' branch has now been made the DEFAULT branch.
   - The 'master' branch has now been made a PROTECTED branch.

Chris Schmidt will be uploading this to Maven sometime later this day,
probably once he's through with his day job. Lastly, a special shout-out to
Matt Seil and Jeremiah Stacey for their help with Git and some nasty JUnit
concurrency issues.

*EVENTS: Upcoming AppSec Events*

<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/51bee3e7f2>

The European OWASP Conference is going to be one of the best ever.
Come to hear and share ideas with the experts!
27 June - 1 July 2016

Read the latest news on the next *OWASP AppSecEU* on the conference site:
http://2016.appsec.eu/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/097d656140>

Important keynote speakers will be present at the Marriott Park Hotel in
Rome, Italy. Our special guest will be Charlie Miller, who will present the
keynote talk "Bugs ruin everything". In his speech, Miller will discuss
some popular methods for finding vulnerabilities and why it is so difficult
to spot them.

*Charlie Miller is a senior security engineer at Uber ATC, a hacker, and a
gentleman.* Back when he still had time to research, he was the first with
a public remote exploit for both the iPhone and the G1 Android phone. He is
a four-time winner of the CanSecWest Pwn2Own competition. He has authored
three information security books and holds a PhD from the University of
Notre Dame. He has hacked browsers, phones, cars, and batteries.

The *Open Web Application Security Project* is an open-source project for
application security. OWASP provides advice on the creation of secure
Internet applications and testing guides.

It boasts a strong global community with more than 45,000 participants,
more than 55 corporate members and 20 academic supporters through 249
active local chapters in 6 continents and 97 countries.

More than 800 people are expected at the event, with 3 days of training
followed by the 2-day conference that includes:

   - Five parallel talks with focus on the OWASP core mission (Dev, Ops,
   Hack, CISO and Research);
   - Keynotes from industry leaders;
   - Exhibition spaces that offer innovative solutions for the needs of
   companies.

Do not miss the opportunity to participate this important conference,
mentioned in Tripwire as a TOP 11 SECURITY CONFERENCE IN 2016
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/5a0c755c6d/d971013ace>
.

More details on registration, program and speakers will be sent in a
forthcoming communication.

Hello all,

Just a quick update on some recent improvements to the OWASP resources on
the wiki. There's a lot of good stuff there already, and there is currently
a push to improve and tidy the content. It's certainly worth a look if you
haven't been there before or for a while.

Hope you find it useful...

Mike

Hey Folks,

I just wanted to point out a few cool things that have changed on the wiki
in the past few weeks.

Xiaoran Wang just updated the XXE page in a way that (I think) finally
brings it up to snuff. Defending against XXE has been illusive and many
defensive guides were just wrong. I think this is solid now. Thanks
Xiaoran!
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing

Abashkin Anton just dropped a mass assignment cheat sheet on us. If you
have time to review, please do so!
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Mass_Assignment_Cheat_Sheet

Tasha Carl has been prolific trying to clean up many of the language
specific areas of the wiki. In particular, Tasha has been working on
cleaning up the Java category and it's now a lot more updated and relevant.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Java

Shruti Kulkarni has also been prolific in dropping good content on the
foundation. Shruti has been making cheatsheet updates such as the access
control https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Access_Control_Cheat_Sheet and
other cheatsheets, and just provided a threat model guide that I'm
reviewing before we wikifi it. Thank you Shruti!

There are many others who continue to work on the wiki, please forgive me
for not mentioning your work. Thanks all!

Aloha,
Jim

Hello all,

I'd like your opinion on an email that came by the OWASP leaders mailing
list - see below. As a chapter, we have funds (not a huge amount, but we
are doing OK). We could use some of them to help this student chapter in
Ukraine, but I wanted to see what the views of our community are, since the
funds are for your benefit really.

If you have a view, one way or the other, let me know by replying either to
the mailing list if you like, or directly to me (mike.goodwin at owasp.org) if
you would rather keep your view private.

Best regards,

Mike


*Hi OWASP Leaders!*

*We received a request for a $200 donation from a chapter or project
allocation to help the Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics
fund the printing of marketing materials and giveaways for their upcoming
events.*




*https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics>Since
student chapters do not qualify for a separate allocation from the
Foundation, we are asking that an OWASP chapter or project volunteer some
funds out of their allocations to help this student chapter. Typically this
would be a local OWASP Chapter, however, KNURE is in Kharkiv, Ukraine and
does not have a local chapter in it's vicinity.*

*If you are interested in helping out, please forward the amount you would
like us to allocate and we can process it toward the KNURE expenses.*


*Hi.*

*I'm leader of OWASP KNURE student chapter. We would like to print some
marketing materials for our chapter to popularize it, but we don't have
enough money to do it. We would like to print: notepads, pens, packets and
stickers. We need around $200-$250 (USD).*

*At the moment student chapters at OWASP are are not eligible for chapter
funding, so we would like to ask the OWASP-leaders for a donation to our
student
chapter:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Kharkiv_National_University_of_Radio_Electronics>*

*Thank you for your help and support in advance.*

*Sincerely yours,*
*Vadym Chakrian.*


*Thanks!*

Hello Mike,

The folks in the Kharkiv Region have been through hell and back. So a
helping hand from Newcastle OWASP is a good idea. Hopefully we can also
create some kind of connection with the Student Group in Kharkiv.

As you know, we also need to gain some publicity for our own Group.


John
