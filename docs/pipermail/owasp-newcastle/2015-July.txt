Hello all,

This is to confirm that the next OWASP Newcastle meeting will be on
28/07/2015 from 18:00 to 21:00 at Northumbria University Ellison Building
EBA002.

We have one confirmed speaker so far: *Andrew Waite* will be taking
about *"Honeypots;
>From Research to the Enterprise".* Thank-you Andrew for volunteering!

We are working on a second speaker and will confirm ASAP. If you would like
to volunteer to speak at the next meeting or any future one, please get in
contact with the chapter leaders - you would be very welcome!

As always, attendance is free and you don't need to register in advance,
but it helps us gauge the size of the half-time pizza order if you register
at:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-meeting-for-july-tickets-17634654727

I won't see you there because I will be standing in a queue for the Peter
Pan ride at Disneyworld, but I'm sure it will be interesting!

Best regards,

Mike

Event Details:
------------------------------

This is the third meeting of the OWASP Newcastle chapter.
Our first speaker is Andrew Waite will be taking about "Honeypots; From Research to the Enterprise". I read a lot about honeypots and they are generating some startling data about the nature and types of attacks that are happening in the real world. I'll be interested to see how i could start to apply them in my working environment.
Our second speaker is George Chlapoutakis talking about "Security in a World of Containerisation". Containerisation technologies like Docker are a hot topic in the DevOps world at the moment, and how to secure them is an "interesting" challenge.
If you would like to volunteer to speak at the next meeting or any future one, please get in contact with the chapter leaders - you would be very welcome!
