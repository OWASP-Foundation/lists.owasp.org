Hey everyone thanks for coming to OWASP last Tuesday, the talks and
questions asked were really insightful. I'll have both presentations up on
the website as soon as I can. Don't forget to tell all your friends, and
get them to sign up to this mailing list! I was wondering if you have any
feedback about absolutely anything to do with the event? We're always
looking to improve!

Thanks very much
Connor

Hi Conner,

Thanks for the presentations. I enjoyed the Honey-pot one a lot. The second one, about containers, was a bit beyond me I'm afraid - I don't think it fitted with my experience so far, but still an interesting presentation.

Pizzas were a great added bonus, I did not know they were going to be any ?

Improvements? Maybe a shorter pizza break, that's all. 

Look forward to the next meet. 

Regards
Steve Dodsworth
