"Cognitive bias and it's role in security vulnerabilities"

An introduction to the psychology of cognitive bias and how human nature
and cognitive biases are the key to user based security vulnerabilities.

A look at how our brains trick us into feeling safe while giving our pin
number to strangers on the phone plus a look at how we can use technology
to disrupt cognitive bias and use these human traits to mitigate threats
and strengthen application security.


 Andy Ward

Security Compliance for Developers - Are we Certified... or Certifiable?

Against a background of increasing threats and hacks, with more and more of
our personal lives and business processes conducted online, it's never been
more important to ensure our software is secure and robust. But how do you
prove it? These days, reassuring your customers takes more than an SSL
padlock, and some marketing spiel mentioning 'banking grade encryption'!

After a quick reminder of "what's the worst that can happen...", Andy will
introduce some of the security Compliance and Certification systems that
help you 'walk the walk', and provide confidence that your system has its
security in good hands, before looking at what it means for developers and
engineering teams.

an hour.

Hello everyone,

Yesterday was a really successful day and we had an excellent turn out.
Both speakers were very interesting and I personally learned a lot!

While there we took quite a lot of feedback from yourselves and we are
definitely going to act on the feedback. That being said if you didn't give
feedback last night or you have more to add feel free to reply to this
email.

Attached are the presentations that Neil and Andy gave including speakers
notes.

The next meeting will be 26/05. Closer to the date we will have an
eventbrite set up for the event so we have a good idea of numbers/

The slides from all previous meetings and the abstracts will always be
available on the OWASP Newcastle wiki page found here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newcastle

See you next time and thanks for attending!
