Subject: [Owasp-leaders] All Day DevOps Conference
To: owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org


Hi All,

I?m a volunteer and track leader for the free world-wide virtual conference
event called All Day DevOps, http://www.alldaydevops.com/.  There is a
round 50 sessions or so and around 8000 registered attendees from around
the globe so far.  I?m looking for some assistance to help me organize the
track sessions on the day of the event.  Collect questions from the
audience and present them to the speaker.  Keep speakers on schedule.
Communicate concerns to track leaders if there are any technology
problems.  Track moderators can work from anywhere there is an Internet
connection and it?s quiet.  The event is all day but I?m looking to keep
volunteer moderators commitment to a 4hr time block.  It?s my desire to
keep volunteer moderators experience light and positive.  Moderators don?t
need to be located in USA and there are local friendly times you can help.

If you or someone in your chapter has never spoke at a conference or helped
to organize a conference this could be an interesting opportunity for the
resume.  Send me a note if your interested.

Regards,
Milton Smith

*This is not an OWASP event but it?s a free non-marketing type event with a
full security track.

Subject: [Owasp-leaders] OWASP Core Rule Set v3.0.0 (final) Released
To: owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org


Greetings fellow OWASP members,
It is with great excitement that I am able to share the culmination of a
project the Core Rule Set team has been developing for quite some time -
OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) Version 3.0.0 (stable). For those who are
unaware, the OWASP CRS is a set of generic rules designed to protect users
against threats like the OWASP Top 10
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project>. The rule
set is most often deployed in conjunction with an existing Web Application
Firewall like ModSecurity <https://modsecurity.org/>.
This latest version features many changes that help make CRS a valuable
part of a Defense in Depth strategy for protecting you web application.
Some these include:

   - Improved and More Precise Detection Coverage
   - Reduced False Positives and the Introduction of Paranoia Levels
   - Anomaly Scoring Mode by Default
   - Simplified User Experience
   - New Remote Code Execution Rules
   - Improved Layout, Documentation, and Testing

With this new release we are seeing on the order of 90-95% fewer false
positives in production environments. This is a large step that should make
CRS more accessible to the masses and we hope you all find it useful as
well.

To download a copy or to submit any issue, please visit our Github
<https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs> (https://github.
com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/releases/tag/v3.0.0). If you are
seeking additional information about the release, please check out this
accompanying blog post <http://goo.gl/f4uxlq>. The OWASP CRS team is truly
excited and pleased with this release, there are even rumors this new rule
set is being made into a movie <https://modsecurity.org/crs/poster>

Sincerely Chaim Sanders, on behalf of the Core Rules Set development team.
