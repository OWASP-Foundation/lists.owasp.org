I would assume there are a few registered but not many discussions since
its creation. That can always be changed though! :)

Come to think of it, I will make the Nothumbria University's Ethical
Hacker's aware of it, might encourage more interaction.

Hi Brian,

 

The Newcastle group has been quiet for a while unfortunately.

 

I was speaking with a gent (who I'll keep nameless for the time being) who
was discussing plans for starting a new group in the Middlesbrough/Stockton
region. If I hear anything else in this regard I'll make yourself and the
rest of the group aware.

 

Regards,

Andrew Waite
