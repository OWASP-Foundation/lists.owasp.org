<PRE>(repost of original message sent to the AppSensor project mailing list)

On Wednesday I saw an email from the UK Cybersecurity Challenge
company that runs competitions to raise awareness of cyber learning
opportunities and careers. They have entered the ESET CyberSmart
Awards &quot;to recognise individuals and organisations up and down the UK
that are working on projects to keep people secure online&quot;. I thought
if they can do it, so can we.

I proposed in the submission that educating software developers about
defending their applications is as useful (as training users) to
protect citizens of all sorts (not just children and young people).

Most of the other entries are local initiatives by schools to help
parents and children, but the Cybersecurity Challenge's entry isn't.
It is more of a national thing.  The entries are grouped per region.
As my office is based in Northumberland, I selected North East. I have
explained in a subsequent email that AppSensor is actually more of a
virtual project without any particular physical location and that
volunteer contributors are from around the UK and further afield. The
entries will be assessed in this manner:

   &quot;Twelve regional entrants from around the country will be
shortlisted by a public vote,
    with the overall winner being decided by our prestigious panel of
judges below. There&#8217;s
    a &#163;5,000 grant for the deserving winner, as well as &#163;500 funding
for second and third prizes.&quot;

So far, there are no other entries in the North East. But please do vote!

   Entry: AppSensor
   <A HREF="http://cybersmartawards.org/entries/appsensor/">http://cybersmartawards.org/entries/appsensor/</A>

   Entry rules
   <A HREF="http://cybersmartawards.org/official-competition-rules/">http://cybersmartawards.org/official-competition-rules/</A>

Watch you don't submit that &quot;click to vote&quot; button more than once, as
we don't want to have the entry withdrawn. I can't see anything in the
rules about who/what is allowed to vote.

Even if we don't get any further, it is awareness anyway.

Colin
