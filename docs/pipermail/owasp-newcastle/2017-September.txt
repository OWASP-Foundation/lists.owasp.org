Hello all,

After a very long pause, we are pleased to say we have our next meeting
lined up. As usual you don't need to register, but it helps us get the

.

The  meeting is on *Tuesday 19th September from 18:00 to 21:00 at CCE1
building, City Campus East, Northumbria University.*

We are using our traditional "talk-pizza-talk" format, looking at two OWASP
projects - one flagship and one incubator.

*Talk 1: Gareth Dixon*

*Running a security event using OWASP Security Shepherd*

In this talk I will cover running a security event using OWASP Security
Shepherd <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd>. The
event to be discussed was staged to promote engagement in a security
initiative, understanding of security vulnerabilities and the application
of knowledge to production services and applications. This talk will cover
the project planning stage, through execution to the project retrospective.

*Pizza and networking*

*Talk 2: Mike Goodwin*

*Enter the (Threat ) Dragon:Threat Modeling with OWASP Threat Dragon*

Threat modeling is a great technique for hardening your application
designs, but current tooling is a bit "crashy", limited to Windows or not
free. OWASP Threat Dragon
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Threat_Dragon> is an OWASP incubator
project that aims to fix this and bring threat modeling to the masses. This
talk is a tour round the tool, it's future road map and a look under it's
hood. Mike the the project leader for Threat Dragon, so if you want to
contribute, he would be very pleased to speak to you.
Hope to see you there!
