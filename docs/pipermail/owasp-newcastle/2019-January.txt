Subject: [Owasp-newcastle] We're back - 26th February
Message-ID: <CAH4TEsCq9VORiUrFSGUPfCU6FRPMceswqykfYDw9d9Bh4WpQJQ@mail.gmail.com>

 We're back with our first event of 2019! We'll be hosting 2 great talks in
our usual talk-pizza-talk fashion. The room is CCE01-403 (4th floor) which
is in the Law building of Northumbria University.

This is the same building as the previous meet ups in 2018. The room is on
the 4th floor and it may be named Harvard room or CCE01-403, there should
be signs up inside the building to direct you to the room.


*Talk 1: Matt Wixley (@darkartlab)*The talk will be three smaller talks,
covering:
Remote online social engineering (how attackers use catfishing techniques)
Hacking with light and sound (using infrared, ultrasound, and lasers to
exfiltrate data and disrupt sensors)
Attack linkage (using granular attack behaviours to link different cyber
attacks)


*Talk 2: Kathryn Cardose (@AGeordieLass)*Getting stakeholders on board
So you?ve nailed the tech, you?ve found the controls, you?ve requested
remediation.....how do you get stakeholders of all levels to buy in and
support security?
