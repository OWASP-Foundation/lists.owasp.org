Hi all,

Hope you all had a good new year and Christmas/other appropriate religious
holiday.

Thank you for coming to the OWASP 2017 events and making them great again.
Just to let you know our first event for 2018 has been arranged and tickets
are available on eventbrite here:
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-january-2018-meetup-tickets-42204092577

The meetup is on 30th January 2018, at 6pm. Again this will be held at
Northumbria University Law building, I just want to say a huge thanks to
Neil Dixley and Luke Sadler for stepping forward to talk.

If anyone has any ideas for talks and wants to present we're always look
for new speakers and talks so feel free to speak to me at the January
meetup or email me directly.

Thanks and see you on the 30th!

Andi
