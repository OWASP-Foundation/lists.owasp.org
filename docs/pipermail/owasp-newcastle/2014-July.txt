Hello all, I've been struggling to find any info regarding this as most of
the website seems outdated, is the Newcastle chapter still active? If so
can somebody give me some information regarding the chapter.

Thanks in advance

Connor

Hey Connor,

I don't think it ever took off. Are you at Northumbria Uni doing Ethical
Hacking? If so, they have a fairly active Facebook group and seem to have a
few meetings in Newcastle.
