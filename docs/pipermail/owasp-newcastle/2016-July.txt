Subject: [Owasp-newcastle] OWASP Newcastle August Meeting!
Message-ID: <CAPC7AoHN2epad30vSwKWJ-ReMgFjdeoW5Vd_DbFk6Ds30dwdfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Apologies for the massive gap since our last meeting. I'm pleased to say
though that we have a meeting with two great speakers set up for August
23rd at a new location - Campus North. You can register for free as usual
here:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-august-2016-meeting-tickets-26777246465

Also as usual, registration is not required, but it helps us gauge numbers
for the pizza order.

The notice is a bit short so to help boost numbers, please email/post/tweet
etc. to your network.

Hope to see you there!
