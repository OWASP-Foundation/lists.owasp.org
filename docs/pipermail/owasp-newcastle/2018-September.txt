Hi all,

Hope you all had a great summer whatever you did. The next OWASP Newcastle
meeting is upon us. We're back at what seems to be our permanent home,
Northumbria University law building.

Our next event is on Tuesday 25th September. We're on the 4th floor, the
Harvard room we've been in most recently. This should be sign posted.

In our talk-pizza-talk format.

We have two great talks, thanks to both speakers for coming forward to keep
the momentum going. We really want more people to talk. About anything
cyber security related, maybe you've seen a cool bug, developed a tool, or
just want to share knowledge. Talks can be anything from 20 - 60 minutes,
if you have an idea feel free to email us.

The two talks will be:

Talk 1: Andy Ferguson
"Don't tell your Big Brother" Encryption tips and tricks

and

Talk 2: Gavin Johnson-Lynn
My Path to CSSLP

Tickets are available at:

Also, Jim Hooker from Bede Gaming has created a slack channel for all
people infosec in the North East to share and chat, feel free to join us at:

Lastly, if any winners from the last meetings CTF haven't received their
prizes yet can you email me.

Thanks,

Andy
