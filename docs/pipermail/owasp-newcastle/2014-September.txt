Hello everyone, we have some excellent talks scheduled, I'll be trying to
secure a venue next week and we can start discussing potential dates later.
If you could all fill out this strawpoll to let me know what days of the
week are best for you http://strawpoll.me/2528895. You can choose multiple
days and the end result will also be determined by speaker availability.

A bit of a teaser on what we have ready at the event is attached.
