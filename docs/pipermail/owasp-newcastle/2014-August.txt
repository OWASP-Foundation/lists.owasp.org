Hello all, the mailing list has doubled since this chapter has started back
up which is excellent news, myself and Mike have a lot planned for the
first talk which I can't wait to announce. Until that announcement though,
if you could all mention to your local contacts the OWASP chapter and get
people on the mailing list that'll be fantastic thanks.

If you have any questions feel free to message myself or Mike Goodwin.

Thanks

Connor Carr
OWASP Newcastle Chapter Co-Leader
