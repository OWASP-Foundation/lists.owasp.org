Hello all,

OWASP is now on Slack. You can get an invite at http://owasp.herokuapp.com and
once you are in you can find the Newcastle Chapter channel at
#chapter-newcastleuk. I'm going to try to hook the mailing list up to that
channel so future emails should appear there (once I've done it).

If Twitter is your thing you can follow the chapter there too
 (@OWASP_Newcastle).

Best regards,

Mike

Dear all,

Or you can go straight to the download here:

Subject: [Owasp-newcastle] OWASP Security Shepherd v3 released
Message-ID: <CAPC7AoEQ_Ju3wXFHaA0r8B98kAuj64=HzBTZ5QQqqBOLGowtSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Hot on the heels of ASVS v3, OWASP Security Shepherd v3 has just been
released:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd

Security Shepherd is a training platform for mobile and web application
security. Obviously being OWASP, it is free and open source.

I haven't used it myself yet, but I've heard very good things about it. If
you try it out, it would be great to hear any feedback either via this
mailing list, or our Slack channel. You could even feedback via a talk at
one of our meetings!

Best regards,

Mike

Subject: [Owasp-newcastle] November meeting long talk details
Message-ID: <CAPC7AoFJP8M1K7suJ7OUmNnWwfrK_8KBNgjJjomCmOZ7-RHgWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

The title and abstract for the long talk by Ben Lee and Ross Dargan for our
November meeting is now confirmed:

*The problems with proving identity.*



In this talk Ross  (@rossdargan) and Ben (@bibbleq) will discuss the
conundrum of proving (and more importantly verifying!) identity online.
While both of these tasks might seem simple at first, they really aren't.
This is a problem that people have grappled with since the beginning of
communications (okay so not the online part!) and we still don't have all
the answers.


You can just turn up on the night, or register for free at:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-meeting-for-november-tickets-18978007732

Hope to see you there!

Mike
