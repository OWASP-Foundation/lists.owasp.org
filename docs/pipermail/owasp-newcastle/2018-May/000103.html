<PRE>*Hey,You may have noticed we have decided to postpone our May event. We
assure you this has nothing to do with GDPR! But rather that we&#8217;re looking
to do something exciting.You may have seen our twitter poll
(<A HREF="https://twitter.com/OWASP_Newcastle/status/991716097626923008">https://twitter.com/OWASP_Newcastle/status/991716097626923008</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://twitter.com/OWASP_Newcastle/status/991716097626923008">https://twitter.com/OWASP_Newcastle/status/991716097626923008</A>&gt;), if not
then spoiler we&#8217;re looking to run a capture the flag competition.We will
provide more details nearer to the time, but you can compete in a team or
on your own. There will be food and drink provided and a leaderboard will
be setup to give an air of friendly competition to the evening.
Technologies and exploits will be standard web app type
vulnerabilities.We&#8217;re looking to do this on Tuesday 26th June, and have a
room booked from 6pm til around 10pm, so it&#8217;s likely the CTF will run for
around 3 hours, and then we can award prizes to the top 3 teams, as well as
anyone else we think has done great or particularly foolish things (people
have been known to wipe entire servers by mistake). We&#8217;ll also have the
OWASP leaders giving friendly hints during the challenge. This means that
if you haven&#8217;t tried a CTF before, there&#8217;s no reason not to team up and
give it a go.If you&#8217;re interested in giving it a go, tickets are available
on eventbrite
<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-may-2018-meetup-tickets-43192186994">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-may-2018-meetup-tickets-43192186994</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-may-2018-meetup-tickets-43192186994">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-may-2018-meetup-tickets-43192186994</A>&gt;,
and we&#8217;ll be sending out a reminder email via eventbrite a week before to
gauge the amount of people who will be attending. We had a lot of
registrations for our event in March but turnout wasn&#8217;t quite as many as
we&#8217;d hoped. So if you can&#8217;t attend please return your ticket so someone
else has a chance of grabbing one.*If anyone has any questions, comments,
feedback feel free to drop me an email.

Andi
