Event Details:
------------------------------

This is the third meeting of the OWASP Newcastle chapter.
Our first speaker is Andrew Waite will be taking about &quot;Honeypots; From Research to the Enterprise&quot;. I read a lot about honeypots and they are generating some startling data about the nature and types of attacks that are happening in the real world. I'll be interested to see how i could start to apply them in my working environment.
Our second speaker is George Chlapoutakis talking about &quot;Security in a World of Containerisation&quot;. Containerisation technologies like Docker are a hot topic in the DevOps world at the moment, and how to secure them is an &quot;interesting&quot; challenge.
If you would like to volunteer to speak at the next meeting or any future one, please get in contact with the chapter leaders - you would be very welcome!

OWASP Newcastle Chapter
The OWASP Foundation came online on December 1st 2001 it was established as a not-for-profit charitable organization in the United States on April 21, 2004 to ensure the ongoing availability and support for our work at OWASP. OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas. We can be found at www.owasp.org. The newcastle chapter details can be found at <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newcastle.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newcastle.</A>
