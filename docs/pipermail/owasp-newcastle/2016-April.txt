Hello all,

progressing:

Hello all,

This is something I like to look at from time to time. This time I noticed
that Threat Modeling was in the Adopt category for techniques and also
OWASP ASVS is in the Assess category.

I think ASVS is a great tool and I hope they push it through to Adopt soon
:o)

Thanks for posting Mike,

At the moment I'm currently working on traffic analysis of Exploit Kits.
This is a good reminder that Threat Analysis can be important for better
EK comprehension.Of course the OWASP, Threat Analysis Guide is a
first-class Guide in this area.
