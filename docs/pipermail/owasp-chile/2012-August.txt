*OWASP Project Leaders -*

We would love to have you come to the conference and present on your OWASP
Project and event have special funds available to help cover the travel for
OWASP Project Leaders. If you are interested in presenting, please submit
through our Call for
Papers<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHNFa3NyTV82VFNiVVh5VnllU2tfQnc6MA>
and
send an email requesting funding toAppSecLatam2012 en owasp.org.


*OWASP Chapter Leaders - *

As part of AppSec Latam 2012, a free chapter leaders workshop will be held
the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19th (the day before the conference). Details
on the workshop can be found on the conference website: appseclatam.org under
the "Chapters Workshop" tab.


Sponsorship funds are also available for Latam chapter leaders who want to
attend the workshop and conference. If you need financial assistance to
attend the Chapter Leader Workshops please submit a request to via the
Contact Us Form http://owasp4.owasp.org/contactus.html by September 17,
2012.


   - Priority of sponsorships will be given to those not covered by a
   sponsorship to attend a previous workshop. Additionally, we are looking
   for new or struggling chapter leaders who need assistance kick starting
   their chapter.
   - When you apply for funding, please let us know *why we should sponsor
   you*. While we prefer that chapter leaders use their own chapter's funds
   before requesting a sponsorship, this is not a requirement for application.
   - If your chapter has fund but will not be using them to sponsor
your attendance,
   please include why you will not be using the funds for this purpose
   (i.e. what are the other plans for those funds?).

Learn more and submit your information at: appseclatam.org

Thanks and Best Regards,
Sarah Baso on behalf of the AppSec Latam 2012 Planning Team
