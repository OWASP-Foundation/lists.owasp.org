<PRE>Buna,

interesati de proiectele Owasp. In acest fel, este incurajat schimbul de
idei si cooperarea in afara capitolului local.

securitate din toata lumea.

Subject: [Owasp-leaders] NEW OWASP Community Mailing-list - please join and
forward to your chapter and project members and invite them to join!
To: <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-romania">owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org</A>


 <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Community_List">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Community_List</A>

(Just fyi: this proposal was discussed by the OWASP board a few weeks ago,
and if you like the idea, we like to invite everyone to vote with your feet
and join the mailing-list to hopefully make this a successful new way for
the OWASP community to communicate within our community, allow new
contributors to join and include everyone active in our community to join
discussions about important OWASP community topics. )


 New Mailing-List &quot;OWASP-Community&quot;  *Sign-up here
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community</A>&gt;* Reasoning:

To open global OWASP discussions to the global community, beyond the
leaders-list. Over the last months and years, we noticed that we had a
number of discussions on the &quot;leaders-list&quot; that should in fact have been
open to many more of our members and active contributor as well. Like
proposing new ideas for projects and initiatives or e.g. the discussion
about RSA and the OWASP security statement. Note: The leaders-list will
remain very important and essential for all project and chapter leadership
questions. I just like to enable normal OWASP members and contributors to
exchange ideas and cooperate across chapter boundaries as well. For example
it would be nice if OWASP members could coordinate worldwide across
chapters to start projects and initiatives or spontaneously join together
for a new OWASP initiative. Some of these discussions currently happen
informally somewhere in the hallway of a conference, or are done on the
leaders list and then sometimes communicated into the local chapters - or
not. Which IMHO leaves out the many OWASP members and active contributors,
who might be interested in joining interesting new projects or starting new
initiatives or voicing their opinion about what OWASP should do in global
questions, but who can not participate in the discussion directly because
they are not chapter leaders or project leaders.


  Name: &quot;owasp-community&quot;  Scope:

topics in-scope of this mailing-list are new project and initiative ideas
that are looking for other fellow contributors and volunteers and news that
are relevant and valuable for the global OWASP community. Explicitly out of
scope is everything that can be discussed in a specific project or chapter
or group of chapters, and topics that are already covered by the scope of
any other mailing-list like the governance and project lists. And as this
is a global mailing-list with potentially a lot of subscribers, we ask
members to be very cautious and conservative in posting there and follow
the scope definition very carefully. Furthermore, please refrain from
cross-posting to this mailing-list. And be considerate whether you really
need to reply to the whole list of thousands of people if e.g. you just
want to sign up to a new initiative. A direct reply to the person who sent
the initial message can spare others a lot of email traffic.
 Target group:

all OWASP leaders, active contributors and those who are interested in
joining a project or initiative and don't know yet which one, OWASP
members, and everyone interested in the global OWASP community.
 Sign-up:

The list is free for anyone to subscribe / unsubscribe.

*Please sign-up here
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community</A>&gt;*

At the start, I suggest that the list should be pre-filled with all members
of the leaders-list and all OWASP members (as per the membership list) with
the option to unsubscribe like from any other free mailing-list. Going
forward I propose to add a flag at the membership renewal form (i.e. when
you pay your membership fee) that you want to be on the global
&quot;OWASP-community&quot; mailing-list (with the default setting to be &quot;yes&quot;). And
I would appreciate if we could send an email to all chapter mailing-lists
to inform people there about this new global OWASP community mailing-list
which is open to everyone.


All the best,

Tobias
