Hello,

Are you an objective C programmer? The OWASP iGoat project lead by Ken van
Wyk is looking for help!

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_iGoat_Project

The short-term need for OWASP iGoat basic code maintenance. There are a
couple of deprecated (in iOS 7) methods that are used in OWASP iGoat. We
need a dev to read through those (2 instances) and decide how to replace
them. Next, there are a BUNCH of presentation layer things that changed in
iOS 7. Buttons and such that used to look fine now look horrible. That's
pretty light weight code slinging, but needs to be done.

The project is also looking for a dev lead to help implement a couple new
exercises. Ken has a few exercises story-boarded out and needs someone to
help with that coding. For example, one MUCH needed new exercise is one
that illustrates how to use the Data Protection API properly.

Please drop Ken a line if you or someone you know is interested.

Aloha,
Jim
