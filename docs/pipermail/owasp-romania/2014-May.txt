1) A node.js based (node.js + express + mongodb) target application
vulnerable to OWASP Top 10 risks
2) A tutorial guide that includes description and solution to each security

3) Grunt based build system with tasks to verify coding and formatting
guidelines, build and start server, etc.

*Installation / Accessing Node Goat :*

If you would like to deploy local instance of the OWASP NodeGoat project,
please visit *project's github repository* for source code and instructions.

Here is a heroku app <http://nodegoat.herokuapp.com> with Node Goat

Subject: [Owasp-leaders] Code Pulse 1.0 Released - Real-time code coverage
tool
To: owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org


Hello All,

We've just recently pushed out the first major release for the newly minted
OWASP Code Pulse project. Code Pulse is a tool targeted at pentesters. It
shows real-time code coverage for JVM based applications as they are being
penetration tested. The coverage information is represented visually and I
still personally get a kick out of seeing all the blinking methods as they
get called in real-time behind the scenes.

You can find information on the tool and download links at
http://code-pulse.com

For those of you that might find the tool useful, we're feedback-starved
and would love to hear what you think.

Any help spreading the word on the project would also be much appreciated!

Thanks,
Hassan
