Hi all,

I failed to contact Claudiu-Alesandru Constantnescu on the e-mail listed on
the chapter home page https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Romania

Is there any activity in your chapter?
Can I help you to get it (re)started?

Can somebody forward me the (new) contact details of  Claudiu-Alesandru?

Thank you,

--Seba

Hi Stefan,

if i get no response from Claudiu-Alesandru, I propose you check page
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_Start_an_OWASP_Chapter
and apply for chapter leadership.
The simplest way to do that is:
1) shoot an e-mail to Kate (in cc)
2) organize a kick-off meeting in the coming monts.
For the first meeting it is important to gather enough people and momentum
to sustain the Romania chapter for the coming year(s).

If you need our help, just let us know.

Kind regards,

Seba

Hi Everyone, Seba,

I have lost access to my former e-mail address and consequently to the list. My contact details are in the signature below - the name published is wrong as well (I had written an e-mail at that time but nothing happened).

I see some interest so I suggest to have a meeting before summer starts and everyone goes on vacation. Just as a tentative date, how does May 27th sound (a month from now)?

Hi,

First of all, 3 positive replies from the list, myself and one colleague who confirmed without posting to the list makes 5.
Hopefully I'll get another ~5 interested, and maybe current members will bring another 5. We're looking at 10-20 people.

I'm trying to obtain a location (in Bucharest) that is appropriately sized, either a very quiet bar corner which would allow a projector, or a free room with an organization/company which is not related to security vendors, at least for the first meetings.

Meanwhile, keep the confirmations coming - if people you know would be interested get them subscribed to the list, and forward me the names and contact details so that I can add them to the count. By end of next week I should have a clear picture of how many people are coming.
If anyone wishes to speak at the event let me know the topic in advance. No sales pitch please :)

Regards,
Claudiu

Call for papers it is then! :)

Regardless the name, I have still got zero "applications". We can accommodate pretty much any presentation since we have none yet, but I suggest having no more than 15-20 minutes per presentation, 4 presentations max for the first meeting.

Please have a look over the formalities at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement . I intend to briefly go over the basics of OWASP since this is the first meeting, and start some discussion on what chapter members see as immediate and long term goals.

The presentations do not need to be the latest and greatest; they just have to be of interest to security specialists, so stuff that appeals to you may appeal to the audience.
Some example topics include:
-          Brief presentation on an OWASP project that you used, or that you are enthusiastic about (here I can cover something on webscarab if no one else wants, since I've used it quite a lot);
-          If you plan to contribute on something, or you are just thinking you may at some point, tell us a few words about it maybe you co-opt some other members too!
-          If you just discovered something on a particular security area, do share;
-          You may also show us how to do something hands on;
-          Do you own the truth on <insert conspiracy theory here> (stuxnet anyone? :) )

For further meetings I'll try to get a speaker from OWASP, but we'll have to do on our own for the first one.

Hi,

First of all, 3 positive replies from the list, myself and one colleague who confirmed without posting to the list makes 5.
Hopefully I'll get another ~5 interested, and maybe current members will bring another 5. We're looking at 10-20 people.

I'm trying to obtain a location (in Bucharest) that is appropriately sized, either a very quiet bar corner which would allow a projector, or a free room with an organization/company which is not related to security vendors, at least for the first meetings.

Meanwhile, keep the confirmations coming - if people you know would be interested get them subscribed to the list, and forward me the names and contact details so that I can add them to the count. By end of next week I should have a clear picture of how many people are coming.
If anyone wishes to speak at the event let me know the topic in advance. No sales pitch please :)

Regards,
Claudiu

I have my  presentation from my master graduation (Information Security
Technology @ Military Technical Academy). The topic was Webapplication
security testing and the presentation is about scanner comparison: 2
commercial scanners (acunetix and netsparker), 2 saas scanners (qualys was
and outscan was), and 2 open source scanners (proxystrike and websecurify).
I can send you the presentation to take a look at it and to see if it would
be interesting for the guys.
