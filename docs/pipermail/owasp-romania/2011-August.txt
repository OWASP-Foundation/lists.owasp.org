I haven't received any definitive confirmations yet on speakers, just high
level intentions. Nobody has anything to tell us? :)
On a side note, I believe you can book up to 6x the time of a presentation
as CPE at least for CISA certified which I know most of you are - so instead
of completing online quizzes get yourself in front of an audience!

I will also add to this message an interesting hack I came across today:
