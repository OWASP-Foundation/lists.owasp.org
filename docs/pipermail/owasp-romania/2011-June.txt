Seems more like a networking membership:

Why Become a Supporting Member?

   - As a member of the internet community do you agree with the ethics and
   principals<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project>of
OWASP Foundation?
   - Do you want to underscore your awareness of web application software
   security?
   - Do you want to continue to increase your knowledge and expand your
   skills when attending OWASP conferences at a discount?
   - Do you want to expand your personal network of contacts? OWASP
   Linked'In Group <http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/36874>
   - A 40% of your membership fee directly supports the local chapter of
   your choice.
   - You get a @OWASP.ORG email address submit a
request<https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/owasp.org/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dFN1R2NIMTNROXN3dml4ZEcxXzJQYXc6MQ#gid=0>
   - Have (1) individual vote in elections and on issues that shape the
   direction of the community.

Looks interesting, but I don't know if it's of any use for me right now.
Still, I'm considering applying at a certain time.

It was a great experience and a real pleasure presenting. Actually it was
more like an open discussion, I just provided the topic and data.
It was great meeting you all and I can't wait for the next meeting. We
should meet every two months, I'm sure we can find topics

Best regards,
Cristian

Well the way I see it, it might be hard to give the money out of your own
pocket, if the employer does not pay for you.
But for consultancy companies and freelance security professionals for
example should be worth paying for the reasons you mentioned.
It's up to each one to do their maths really. The networking comes free
anyway. It's the recognition you get as a member, and the vote that come at
a cost.
