Dear colleague,

      OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project, www.owasp.org) would like to hear your opinion!

Link to take the CISO Survey 2013 now 

OWASP is preparing the Global CISO report 2013 and conducting a
      survey among CISOs and information security managers in relation
      to application security with the aim of providing you with new
      insights about the state of application security across various
      industry sectors and about new security trends and aligning our
      efforts to better help solving the problems of the future that you
      face.

The survey shall take only a few minutes of your precious time and
      by completing it you are helping shape the future of OWASP, the
      Internet and software security.
At the conclusion of the survey, the aggregated results will be
      publicly available in the form of a report on the owasp.org
      website, keeping your information completely anonymous.

As you may know OWASP is a volunteer open-source organization
      dedicated to fighting the causes of software insecurity. We are
      also a registered charity & non-profit in the USA and the EU.
      See more at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP

The survey can be found here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey

And to spice things up, during the first 14 days of June (until June-16 23:59 GMT), if you provide your contact details at the end of the survey, you will also be entered into a drawing for one of the following donated prizes: 
	* 1 free OWASP CISO training day pass at the AppSecEU in Hamburg 
	* 1 free OWASP CISO training day pass at the AppSecUS in New York 
	* and 1 free CISO training day or half-day pass at one of the upcoming events in Asia. 

Thank you very much in advance for your time.

Subject: [Owasp-leaders] OWASP Top 10 for 2013 is now Released!!
To: OWASP Leaders <owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>


**

The OWASP Top 10 project has updated and released the final version of the
OWASP Top 10 for 2013 based on the feedback it received during the formal
comment period.

The OWASP Top 10 for 2013 is as follows:

A1 Injection

A2 Broken Authentication and Session Management

A3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

A4 Insecure Direct Object References

A5 Security Misconfiguration

A6 Sensitive Data Exposure

A7 Missing Function Level Access Control

A8 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

A9 Using Known Vulnerable Components

A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

The final release can be downloaded from the main project page at:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10

Or the Google Top 10 Project page at: https://code.google.com/p/owasptop10/

If you simply want to download the document immediately, its available at:

http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf

Thanks to everyone for their contributions to this important OWASP project!

Please spread the word to those organizations you are involved in to raise
awareness of these issues, particularly the new and unfamiliar* A9:** Using
Known Vulnerable Components*. With the rapid increase in the pace of
development and the tempo of issuing new releases, it's getting even more
challenging to avoid introducing these risks in modern applications. This
rapid development tempo is also encouraging the increased use of 3rd party
as well as internally developed components, which have security issues just
like any other software. That's why A9 was introduced, to raise awareness
that developers need to make sure they are not continuing to use components
with known vulnerabilities.

Thanks, Dave

Dave Wichers

I'm very pleased to announce that OWASP Podcast 95 is live! Special
thanks to Thomas Herlea who helped edit and produce this show.

This episode features Dan J. Bernstein, a computer science research
professor from the university of Illinois. He is speaking on
"Cryptography Worst Practices".

Dan is a very sharp and controversial character. I hope you enjoy.
