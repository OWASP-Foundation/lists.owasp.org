Subject: [Owasp-romania] nullcon 8-bit Call for Papers is open
Message-ID: <CABZSstxf0B0d2yYsn0NMD+ETGUbAXThmhpR1W3R-VDz2fpxa8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Hackers and Security Pros,

Welcome to nullcon 8-bit!
nullcon is an annual security conference held in Goa, India. The focus
of the conference is to showcase the next generation of offensive and
defensive security technology. We happily open doors to researchers
and hackers around the world and the universe , working on the next
big thing in security and request everyone to submit their new
research.

What is 8-bit?
As a tradition of choosing themes based on year, nullcon 8th year's
theme is 8-bit.
If you love security, hacking, cutting edge research, Goa, trance,
then the universe will conspire to send you to nullcon :)
No, seriously its a lot of learning and fun! Time to tickle your gray
cells and submit your research.

Submission URL
=============
http://nullcon.net/website/goa-2017/cfp.php

Tips for submitting
================

1) Submit early - Submitting early increases the chance of acceptance
in the first round of review itself. The more you delay the more
competition you have with other papers that are submitted later.

2) Technical description - The more concrete technical details you
provide the better chance you have of getting accepted. Reviewers
usually give low score to submissions that have very small or vague
abstract and may not request for more details. The best way is to
provide a supporting full technical paper that explains all the
vulnerabilities, exploits etc in detail.

3) Declining a paper - Please take rejection as a suggestion for
improvement somewhere in the paper and not as an offense. Declining a
paper does not mean your submission is not good. There are many
parameters we look at when reviewing a paper, technical in-depth is
only one of them. Many times we have to let go of really good talks
because there is already an accepted paper on similar subject or too
many good submissions. We want you to succeed and are only trying to
help you in preparing you for future submissions. So, cheer up and get
ready for the next submission.
4) Review comments - We do not ask our review board for comments.
5) Category - If the submission is (being) presented prior nullcon or
if it is an enhancement of an already presented research, please DO
NOT mark it as new research as it falls under current research.

I have rarely gotten to speak with many of you (yet), but in my

>
> The OWASP Core Rule Set team is proud to announce the first of two
> planned release candidates for the upcoming OWASP ModSecurity Core
> Rule Set v3.0.0.
>
> This new release represents a huge step forward in terms of both
> capabilities and protections including:
>
> - A 95% reduction in false positives for a typical CRS deployment
> using the default configuration.
> - Extended effectiveness and detection capabilities in numerous areas;
> namely Remote Command Execution and PHP injections (Walter Hop).
> - A simple to use, adjustable paranoia level that allows users to
> tailor their ruleset experience.
> - The capability to allow existing sites to try out the Core Rules by
> enabling the rules for only limited percentage of requests (Christian
> Folini).
>
> Please see the CHANGES document for a detailed list of new features
> and improvements.
> (https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/
> v3.0.0-rc1/CHANGES)
>
> Our desire is to see the Core Rules project used as a baseline
> security feature, effectively fighting OWASP TOP 10 weaknesses with
> few side effects. As such we attempt to cut down on false positives as
> much as possible in the default install. This RC1 therefore offers an
> opportunity for individuals to provide feedback and to report any
> other issues they may face. This is no longer aimed at ModSecurity
> experts. This is the Core Rules for the rest of us.

> Please use the CRS GitHub

> releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc1)
> or the Core Rules mailing list to tell us about your experiences,

> Our current timeline is to seek public feedback on RC1 for the next
> month, followed by an RC2 and subsequently a release.

Unit tests are wonderful things, but they are painful to add to a mature
project that doesn?t have enough of them. We would love to have more ZAP
unit tests, and we are therefore launching a Unit Test Bounty program,
where we pay for unit tests for specific areas of the ZAP codebase.

For full details see: http://zaproxy.blogspot.com/

Please spread the word!
