 Call for papers it is then! :)



Regardless the name, I have still got zero ?applications?. We can
accommodate pretty much any presentation since we have none yet, but I
suggest having no more than 15-20 minutes per presentation, 4 presentations
max for the first meeting.



Please have a look over the formalities at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement . I intend to briefly go
over the basics of OWASP since this is the first meeting, and start some
discussion on what chapter members see as immediate and long term goals.



The presentations do not need to be the latest and greatest; they just have
to be of interest to security specialists, so stuff that appeals to you may
appeal to the audience.

Some example topics include:

-          Brief presentation on an OWASP project that you used, or that you
are enthusiastic about (here I can cover something on webscarab if no one
else wants, since I?ve used it quite a lot);

-          If you plan to contribute on something, or you are just thinking
you may at some point, tell us a few words about it maybe you co-opt some
other members too!

-          If you just discovered something on a particular security area,
do share;

-          You may also show us how to do something hands on;

-          Do you own the truth on <insert conspiracy theory here> (stuxnet
anyone? :) )



For further meetings I?ll try to get a speaker from OWASP, but we?ll have to
do on our own for the first one.

Hi,



First of all, 3 positive replies from the list, myself and one colleague who
confirmed without posting to the list makes 5.

Hopefully I?ll get another ~5 interested, and maybe current members will
bring another 5. We?re looking at 10-20 people.



I?m trying to obtain a location (in Bucharest) that is appropriately sized,
either a very quiet bar corner which would allow a projector, or a free room
with an organization/company which is not related to security vendors, at
least for the first meetings.



Meanwhile, keep the confirmations coming ? if people you know would be
interested get them subscribed to the list, and forward me the names and
contact details so that I can add them to the count. By end of next week I
should have a clear picture of how many people are coming.

If anyone wishes to speak at the event let me know the topic in advance. No
sales pitch please :)



Regards,

Claudiu

Hi,

Since no one proposed a different date, it's 99% sure it's going to be 27th.
The only surprise would be logistics-related.

Asa cum a anuntat deja Claus, avem o locatie tentativa foarte cocheta
in centru, dar trebuie sa ajung acolo ca sa confirm.
Vom avea un raspuns tot pana cel tarziu vineri.

Subject: [Owasp-romania] OWASP presentation at RONUA
Message-ID: <BANLkTimED48rNSYnEm1Q_=QMBuTLkRvy7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

First of all you can now choose Romanian on the list when signing up, so
basically feel free to speak in the language of your choice. Note that we
have one non-Romanian speaking member (Seba), so I think it's polite and
helpful to continue in English.

Our member Andrei Ignat has been kind enough to reserve us a timeslot at the
next RONUA (http://ronua.ro/CS/groups/ronua-bucuresti/default.aspx). This is
a programmer's meeting which will take place one day before our meeting
(pure coincidence). I will present the Owasp top 10 security risks, from a
web programmers' perspective, and I hope we will get some people interested
in OWASP! I believe the target audience there is ideal. If you are
interested in taking part in that event as well, please talk to Andrei.

Has anyone actually used ESAPI? I haven't and I would like to hear some
impressions.

Regarding our meeting - Radu has apparently succeeded in getting us a free
meeting room on the 27th of May. I hope we can all make an effort to arrive
earlier - last I've discussed with him it was 17:00.
He'll tell us the final details as soon as this is 100% confirmed.

Regards,
Claudiu

Why is it hard? Is it locked in a safe? :)
Maybe we can rent if nobody can bring one.

Hello!

My name is Dan Demeter and I have been on this list for a while. 
Unfortunately I will not be in Romania for the next meeting but I found 
an interesting wrap-up about the Belgium OWASP meeting which was held 
yesterday :

> http://blog.rootshell.be/2011/05/23/may-2011-owasp-belgium-meeting-wrap-up/

It would be interesting if someone could do the same for the forthcoming 
Romanian meeting also.

Have a nice day,
Dan

Salut,

Am actualizat wiki-ul: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Romania am pus si
programul acolo (sosirea la 5, va rog sa nu intarziati ca sa trecem rapid
prin formalitatile de inregistrare)
Va astept acolo, sa ne cunoastem si sa stabilim primii pasi ai OWASP
Romania! Locatia e incapatoare, puteti veni si cu alte persoane neanuntate
daca mai stiti pe cineva interesat

Claudiu

Message-ID: <BANLkTimz+nWwcwroJZF7m7sQXHb9JvMaWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Thanks to all who participated, and special thanks who all who contributed
(presentations, logistics, or just sharing their opinions)
The location was especially nice and welcoming, and I hope we can get access
to it again. They even posted our event on their website (
http://www.mlr.ro/ro-evenimente-view-conferinte-191.html)
It's nice to see we got some attendance yesterday from other professional
bodies and network groups (ISACA especially, they announced our event to all
members, but also RONUA and PMI). As promised, I will forward an attendance
sheet to ISACA so that they can credit us CPEs. I will be copying everyone I
know is a member of ISACA - if you don't get a mail next week then let me
know, chances are I missed you.

The first part of the event was an open discussion on OWASP goals,
especially local. We agreed to have our meetings quarterly - I'm proposing
September 9th for the next as many may be on vacation in August. We are
going to actively target students, and a few of you promised to open some
paths for us here. Then the discussion evolved into a very interesting
debate about the legality of hacking in Romania and how authorities see the
phenomenon, and this is a topic that is of interest to everybody, so I would
welcome anyone who wants to expand the subject in the next meeting.

The second part of the event was Cristi's presentation on automated web
vulnerability scanners. Many questions were asked and answered, and this was
the point where we agreed this was the liveliest audience to a presentation
most of us has ever seen.

We then continued to discussions on vulnerabilities from OWASP Top10, with
feedback from the audience, both developers in various languages and
security experts. We stopped at number 4 - one hour over schedule when
everyone was thirsty for beer and hungry for the infamous "mici cu cartofi
prajiti si mustar".

I would like to encourage everyone to sign up for paid membership. Included
in the benefits is also an @owasp.org e-mail address you can brag with :)

Regards,
Claudiu

It was an interesting event with a good audience.

I left a bit early due to previous plans, but I am curious on whether any
participants of some of the enthusiasts on this mailing list are planning to
become full members in the following weeks?

regards
radu
