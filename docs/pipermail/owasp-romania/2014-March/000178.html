OWASP Leaders,
I am pleased to announce the newest member of the OWASP Staff, our new
Community Manager,  Genevieve (GK) Southwick.

*About GK:*
GK Southwick has been working in the Event Planning space for over 20
years. Starting with Physical Security in 1990, she eventually moved on to
roles in Operations, Production, Facilities and Technical Direction, with
an emphasis on personnel management. Active as a volunteer in the InfoSec
space, she is Producer and President of the Board at Security BSides Las
Vegas, is second in command of Physical Safety and Security at DerbyCon,
afternoon Stage Manager and volunteer coordinator for DEFCON SkyTalks, and
until moving to Denver in 2013, was head of Safety and Security and
Volunteer coordinator at Security BSides San Francisco. She now volunteers
with BSidesDenver, where she's currrently running Registration. She has
also run Safety and Security for BruCon in Belgium and at BSidesATL, as
well as helping out wherever necessary at SOURCEBoston.

GK is excited to bring her extensive volunteer management experience to
OWASP, as she takes on the role of Community Manager. She's looking forward
to the challenges and opportunities ahead of her while expanding the
volunteer base within the organization, and working closely with the
Chapter Leaders, to help them fulfill the OWASP Mission and assist them
with their operational needs.

GK has a secondary diploma in Homeland Security from Bryman College, San
Jose, where she graduated in 2004 With Honors.


*GK's Community Management Role with OWASP:*

GK will be helping OWASP to continue building a platform to encourage
volunteer participation the OWASP community. She will also be working with
the chapters to support their efforts and help them grow OWASP's presence
around the world   GK has a passion for this community and mission as well
as invaluable experience in organizing and motivating people.  I look
forward to seeing the great things she will bring to the team and community.
