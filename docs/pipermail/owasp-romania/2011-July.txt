Hi,

Just found this brief classification of best known hacking events. Even
though it looks and is deliberately superficial, they do make a point.

Hi again,

Time to plan for the next OWASP RO meeting. Tentative date is September 9th
- let me know till the end of next week if you intend to attend and doesn't
suit you.
All of you who want to present are most welcome - the friendly and curious
gang of local OWASPians will appreciate it. Please let me have in advance:

Enjoy the summer :)

Subject: 1st OWASP-RO chapter meeting
To: owasp-romania at lists.owasp.org


Hi everyone,

Thanks to all who participated, and special thanks who all who contributed
(presentations, logistics, or just sharing their opinions)
The location was especially nice and welcoming, and I hope we can get access
to it again. They even posted our event on their website (
http://www.mlr.ro/ro-evenimente-view-conferinte-191.html)
It's nice to see we got some attendance yesterday from other professional
bodies and network groups (ISACA especially, they announced our event to all
members, but also RONUA and PMI). As promised, I will forward an attendance
sheet to ISACA so that they can credit us CPEs. I will be copying everyone I
know is a member of ISACA - if you don't get a mail next week then let me
know, chances are I missed you.

The first part of the event was an open discussion on OWASP goals,
especially local. We agreed to have our meetings quarterly - I'm proposing
September 9th for the next as many may be on vacation in August. We are
going to actively target students, and a few of you promised to open some
paths for us here. Then the discussion evolved into a very interesting
debate about the legality of hacking in Romania and how authorities see the
phenomenon, and this is a topic that is of interest to everybody, so I would
welcome anyone who wants to expand the subject in the next meeting.

The second part of the event was Cristi's presentation on automated web
vulnerability scanners. Many questions were asked and answered, and this was
the point where we agreed this was the liveliest audience to a presentation
most of us has ever seen.

We then continued to discussions on vulnerabilities from OWASP Top10, with
feedback from the audience, both developers in various languages and
security experts. We stopped at number 4 - one hour over schedule when
everyone was thirsty for beer and hungry for the infamous "mici cu cartofi
prajiti si mustar".

I would like to encourage everyone to sign up for paid membership. Included
in the benefits is also an @owasp.org e-mail address you can brag with :)

Regards,
Claudiu
