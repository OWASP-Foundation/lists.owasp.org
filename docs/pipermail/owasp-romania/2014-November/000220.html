Descrierea job-ului este mai jos:
=================================

*Job profile:*

   - Conduct technical security assessments and information security
   projects which require expertise in one or more of the following areas:
   Penetration Testing / Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessments and IT
   Security Audits;
   - Identify and exploit technical vulnerabilities in clients&#8217; systems,
   assess business risks of the technical vulnerabilities and communicate to
   client personnel;
   - Perform security configuration analysis for various operating systems,
   especially Windows and Linux / UNIX;
   - This is a position in the Penetration Testers Team which requires
   quick learning and working with new technologies, tools and techniques.

Some typical projects that you will work on (depending on your expertise)
are:

   - Web application penetration testing: try to find vulnerabilities in
   web applications (ex. Internet Banking, eCommerce websites, web portals,
   etc) and report them to the clients. Try to exploit these vulnerabilities
   in order to prove their business impact.
   - Internal network penetration testing: simulate a malicious person who
   already has access to the internal network of the customer (ex. visitor,
   consultant, etc). Starting only from a simple network port access you will
   have to gain access to sensitive information from the client's internal
   network, gain Domain Admin access or reach other flags.
   - Mobile application penetration testing: try to find vulnerabilities in
   mobile applications (Android, iOS, Windows phone) and suggest corrective
   measures in order to improve their security.
   - Other types of technical projects that will involve your imagination
   and out-of-the-box thinking will also occur.

It is sometimes required to make demonstrations and presentations to
clients.
We encourage technical research and presenting our results to hacking
conferences - local and international.

*Specific requirements:*

   - Since IT Security is a multidisciplinary field, we are looking for a
   person who has a broader understanding of technical concepts from one or
   more of the following areas: web applications, system administration,
   networking, software development.
   - In order to understand the technical level that we need, here are a
   few terms/concepts that we expect you to be familiar with: OWASP Top 10,
   HTTP protocol, SSL, SQL, JavaScript, buffer overflow, TCP/IP, DNS,
   wireshark, nmap, Linux shell commands, Kali and others.
   - You also must be able to express your findings in very good technical
   and business English (oral and written).

*Other desired requirements:*

   - Bachelor&#8217;s degree in an IT related field;
   - Hands-on experience in at least one of the following: security
   testing, web application development/testing, system administration,
   networking, software development;
   - Work effectively either individually or as a member of a multi-skilled
   team;
   - Professional discipline, accuracy, reliability and excellent analytic
   skills;
   - Strong interpersonal skills, team spirit, resilience, flexibility,
   adaptability and self-motivation.

*Will be considered a plus:*

   - Certifications such as: OSCP, OSCE, CEH, LPT, CCNA, MCSE.
