Hello,

Iata cateva modalitati de a va implica si de a imbunatati calitatea
informatiilor de pe wiki-ul OWASP.

Subiectele sunt:

   - LDAP injection
   - Hibernate


Mai jos sunt doua mesaje trimise de Jim Manico. El coordoneaza aceasta
initiativa. Daca aveti experienta si doriti sa contribuiti il puteti
contacta direct. (jim.manico at owasp.org)

***********************************************************************************
Hello Folks,

Do you have experience and expertise in stopping LDAP injection? I'd love
your help reviewing the current OWASP resources on the topic.

The main 4 pages are:

   - The main LDAP Injection category page:
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/LDAP_injection
   - The "preventing LDAP in Java" page:
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Preventing_LDAP_Injection_in_Java
   - The LDAP Prevention Cheatsheet:
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet
   - A new resource from the security framework evaluation project:
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Framework_Security_Project/Secure_LDAP_API_Standard


Thank you. If you have serious expertise here (or are just a very good tech
editor) please drop me a line.

Aloha,
Jim
***********************************************************************************

Hello there. Is anyone an expert at the Hibernate Object-Relational mapping
API?

OWASP has a few Hibernate resources that are dated which I'd like to merge
into a OWASP Cheatsheet on the topic and keep up to date.

Here they are...

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hibernate
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hibernate-Guidelines
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hibernate/config-example

If interested drop me a line.

PS: I'm working through the many dated Java resources on the OWASP wiki and
am trying to clean house.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Project_WIPRO_1_2015#tab=Pages_List
If
you want to review some of these, let me know.

Hello,

Comunitatea OWASP are o reducere de 15% pentru MOSS Conf 2016, asa ca daca
vreti sa va cumparati bilete imi puteti scrie si va dau un cod de reducere.

Am atasat comunicatul de presa. Descrierile workshop-urilor sunt mai jos:

? *How to create Java Bindings* (Andrei Vasiliu) ? Laboratorul va acoperi
modalitati de generare de cod JNI pentru biblioteci moderne C ++, expunand
astfel bibliotecile native in Java. Veti afla despre Java Virtual Machine
si modul in care permite inserarea codului in timpul rularii.
? *How to turbocharge your software delivery with Docker* (Sorin Peste) ?
Docker va permite sa proiectati ciclul de dezvoltare a aplicatiilor,
testarea si distribuirea si sa il gestionati cu o interfata consistenta de
utilizator. De asemenea, Aplicatiile Docker ruleaza oriunde - pe hardware
sau in Cloud.
? *How to evaluate the security of cloud applications using open source
tools* (Adrian Furtuna) ? Trainerul va informa participantii despre
diferitele arhitecturi cloud, implementarile de aplicatii si va discuta
suprafata de atac pentru aplicatii in cloud cu ajutorul distributiei Kali
Linux.
Multiple exercitii de descoperire a vulnerabilitatilor vor fi realizate pe
un mediu de testare dedicat: o aplicatie de Internet Banking gazduita in
Cloud (dezvoltata special pentru astfel de training-uri).

O seara frumoasa!
Oana

Hello all,

A great deal of work has gone into cleaning up and updating the OWASP Wiki
XXE ( XML External Entities) resources. Here are the two main updated
resources.

   - XXE Prevention Cheatsheet
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet
   - XXE Vulnerability page
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing

Thank you to Dave Wichers for leading the charge on XEE as well as John
Passki and Xiaoran Wang for their work in this area.

Other XXE pages have been either redirected or deleted. If you see any
other pages in this area that needs cleaning up, let me know.

Aloha,
Jim Manico
