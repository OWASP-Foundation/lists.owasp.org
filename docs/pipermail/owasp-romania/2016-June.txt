Hi all,

In our face to face Board meeting we will be discussing potentially
creating new membership classes, including a gamified "pay anything model"
to help convert supporters into paid members.

We are looking at creating a "developing economies" package to enable those
in countries where even $20 USD is too much. We want to know if you live in
these sorts of countries what is a reasonable price for this package.

We are looking at our first price rise since 2009, and some other measures.
As this is your organization, and we are focused on increasing members,
please take the time to complete this very short six question survey.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VNPMKYR

Your answers will inform the Board as to the best path to:

   - Converting supporters into paid members by setting the right price and
   benefits
   - Making it worthwhile to renew
   - Improving OWASP membership experience

Having the funds we need to conduct our mission is critical, but only if
members continue to support OWASP. Have your say by July 1, 2016!

The good news if you take the survey, you get to see the answers too. It's
entirely anonymous, so please send the survey to members, as many folks who
are interested in OWASP, but are supporters and not yet members, and if
you're a chapter leader, please ask your chapters to respond as well.

thanks,
Andrew
