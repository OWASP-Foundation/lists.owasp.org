<PRE>Hi everyone,

First of all you can now choose Romanian on the list when signing up, so
basically feel free to speak in the language of your choice. Note that we
have one non-Romanian speaking member (Seba), so I think it's polite and
helpful to continue in English.

Our member Andrei Ignat has been kind enough to reserve us a timeslot at the
next RONUA (<A HREF="http://ronua.ro/CS/groups/ronua-bucuresti/default.aspx">http://ronua.ro/CS/groups/ronua-bucuresti/default.aspx</A>). This is
a programmer's meeting which will take place one day before our meeting
(pure coincidence). I will present the Owasp top 10 security risks, from a
web programmers' perspective, and I hope we will get some people interested
in OWASP! I believe the target audience there is ideal. If you are
interested in taking part in that event as well, please talk to Andrei.

Has anyone actually used ESAPI? I haven't and I would like to hear some
impressions.

Regarding our meeting - Radu has apparently succeeded in getting us a free
meeting room on the 27th of May. I hope we can all make an effort to arrive
earlier - last I've discussed with him it was 17:00.
He'll tell us the final details as soon as this is 100% confirmed.

Regards,
Claudiu
