Subject: [Owasp-leaders] OWASP CISO Survey 2013 - need your help - please forward to your chapters and contacts in the industry!
 


Dear colleague,


as a respected information security executive in the industry,
      OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project, www.owasp.org) would like to hear your opinion!

Link to take the CISO Survey 2013 now 

OWASP is preparing the Global CISO report 2013 and conducting a
      survey among CISOs and information security managers in relation
      to application security with the aim of providing you with new
      insights about the state of application security across various
      industry sectors and about new security trends and aligning our
      efforts to better help solving the problems of the future that you
      face.

The survey shall take only a few minutes of your precious time and
      by completing it you are helping shape the future of OWASP, the
      Internet and software security.
At the conclusion of the survey, the aggregated results will be
      publicly available in the form of a report on the owasp.org
      website, keeping your information completely anonymous.

As you may know OWASP is a volunteer open-source organization
      dedicated to fighting the causes of software insecurity. We are
      also a registered charity &amp; non-profit in the USA and the EU.
      See more at <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP</A>

The survey can be found here: <A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISO2013Survey</A>

And to spice things up, during the first 14 days of June (until June-16 23:59 GMT), if you provide your contact details at the end of the survey, you will also be entered into a drawing for one of the following donated prizes: 
	* 1 free OWASP CISO training day pass at the AppSecEU in Hamburg 
	* 1 free OWASP CISO training day pass at the AppSecUS in New York 
	* and 1 free CISO training day or half-day pass at one of the upcoming events in Asia. 

Thank you very much in advance for your time. 

Best regards,


OWASP CISO Survey Project team
