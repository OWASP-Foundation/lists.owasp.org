Hi,

We are very proud to announce a new version of SAMM!

This beta release of SAMM version 2.0 is the result of hard work including
workshops, and input from practitioners and the OWASP community during
summits in Europe and the US.

OWASP SAMM is an open source software assurance model and we consider the
contributions from the community vital. Be a part of the summer release of
version 2.0 by sending your feedback on the structure and content of the
proposed maturity model.

The feedback period ends on 24-Feb-2019. Please, read our notes on how to
provide feedback <https://owaspsamm.org/v2.0b/feedback/>.

Start your review! <https://owaspsamm.org/v2.0b/introduction/>

Thank you, Kind regards, The SAMM project team
