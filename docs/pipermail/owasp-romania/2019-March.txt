Subject: [Owasp-romania] OWASP is retiring Mailman - please join the new
	Google Group
Message-ID: <CAP_KG4jysmO=KffPNG+fLLo+yH=KXgAuoGOaCLNM5ugEzknbvw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

OWASP migrates to Google Groups. This is the link to our group that will
replace this mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/romania-chapter

I hope you are willing to keep in touch with our chapter and still be a
member of the new group. The existing members won't be imported
automatically.
You can join using this "one-click" link:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/romania-chapter/join

More information on how you can join the group is at
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA
(You don't have to have a Google account to join, send and receive email
from a Google Group.)

Here you can find more info about this project:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL

Thank you!
