*OWASP Community, Many thanks again to Sarah for her time and dedication to
OWASP.  Sarah and the entire operations team has made tremendous strides
for OWASP over the years. We&#8217;re sad to see Sarah go, but at the same time
we feel very happy for her and the exciting events in her future. While
OWASP is made up of many great individuals, we are more than just a
collection of individuals. Focused on the mission, we donate countless
hours in our volunteer efforts just to make the world a better place. For
us at OWASP we pursue this through advancing and bringing awareness to
application security. As we&#8217;ve seen over the past week there are many
changes at OWASP. This is a natural evolution of an organization and also
an opportunity for new leaders to step forward. What&#8217;s next? With every
transition we have the opportunity to pause and ask, &#8220;what should we do to
move forward?&#8221; Sometimes this is to continue along the same path as before.
Other times it is to shift into a new direction. There are several changes
happening here at OWASP and we should evaluate what move is best for our
growing community. This could be a straight backfill or this could be
something new. As a community, let&#8217;s have that discussion. A few specific
items: Open There are many different paths forward for OWASP. As a
community let&#8217;s determine where we want to go. The discussion and process
will be open to all. Though we may have different ideas ultimately the
community as a whole will reach a path forward and we can all rally around
the next steps. Focus on Community We must continue to look at how we
advance OWASP to empower community. OWASP is a unique organization and we
need to build structures that are cognizant of our volunteers and their
contributions, and also work in the distributed world wide organization
that we are. This is more than just talk too. We need to address the hard
questions so we can build a well functioning system that is exciting and
welcoming for our community. Two areas are already under discussion and I
encourage you all to get involved, committees 2.0
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2014-May/011794.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2014-May/011794.html</A>&gt; and
the upcoming board elections
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2014_Board_Elections">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2014_Board_Elections</A>&gt;. The business side
of OWASP The business side of OWASP is no small task. We have legal
entities in US and Europe, income from events around the world, tax and
legal obligations and more. In the interim we will be hiring a third party
firm that specializes in the business operations of non-profits. This will
enable OWASP to focus on what we do best, application security. In
addition, the third party will also ensure the business side of the house
is in order. This is a short term engagement that will be re-evaluated as
part of our larger discussion. OWASP Operations Team The operations team
works tirelessly to advance OWASP. We are truly grateful for their efforts.
The business group mentioned above will augment our operations team. Every
member of the operations team plays a critical role and we need them to be
able to focus on their areas of expertise. Although things will be changing
in some areas of OWASP as we all evaluate the best structure, it is still
crucial to provide a single point of contact for the operations team. In
the interim the operations team will report directly to the chairman of the
board, Michael Coates. Continuing the conversation This is only the
beginning of the conversation. Here are several ways to continue sharing
ideas. 1. Open Town Hall A google hangout is scheduled for next week at
Monday, June 16, 7am Pacific (hangout link
&lt;<A HREF="https://plus.google.com/events/c3ol7ofkbu52l6f58rbpkhh6r4c">https://plus.google.com/events/c3ol7ofkbu52l6f58rbpkhh6r4c</A>&gt; &amp; world time
conversions
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converted.html?iso=20140616T07&amp;p1=224&amp;p2=179&amp;p3=136&amp;p4=102">http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converted.html?iso=20140616T07&amp;p1=224&amp;p2=179&amp;p3=136&amp;p4=102</A>&gt;).
The call will be recorded and streamed live. You can join the call in real
time or submit your questions ahead of time via google moderator
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=2136a2&amp;t=2136a2.40">https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=2136a2&amp;t=2136a2.40</A>&gt;. 2. Google
Moderator Have an idea to share? Want to dive into a different proposal?
Use the google moderator
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=2136a2&amp;t=2136a2.40">https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=2136a2&amp;t=2136a2.40</A>&gt; to have a free
form conversation with just enough structure in the tool so good ideas can
rise up. 3. Mailing lists The age old mailing lists (the OWASP leaders list
&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-leaders">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-leaders</A>&gt; and the OWASP
community list &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-community</A>&gt;)
 are still there and will of course be used. But, sometimes good ideas get
lost here in long threads. So please consider capturing important items
within google moderator too. 4. Run for the board Board elections
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2014_Board_Elections">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2014_Board_Elections</A>&gt; are seeking
candidates. Submit your candidacy here. <A HREF="http://www.tfaforms.com/329974">http://www.tfaforms.com/329974</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.tfaforms.com/329974">http://www.tfaforms.com/329974</A>&gt;. Change can sometimes feel a bit
uncomfortable, but at the same time it can be a great opportunity. Let&#8217;s
embrace this opportunity to develop the future of OWASP together. We are
wishing our Sarah all the best for the future and looking forward to all of
your feedback, ideas, and energy that made OWASP the great organization it
is today and which will lead OWASP into the future. - The OWASP Board
