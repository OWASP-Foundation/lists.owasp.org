Hello,

Urmatoarea intalnire OWASP va avea loc joi, 1 februarie, ora 19.00 in
sediul Endava (B-dul Timisoara, nr. 4A, AFI Park 4, etaj 4)

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bucharest#tab=Upcoming_events
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Bucharest/events/246846435/

19:00 - 19:15 *Introduction and OWASP news*
19:15 - 20:00 *Handling of Security Requirements in Software Development
Lifecycle* - Daniel Kefer <https://de.linkedin.com/in/kefer/de> - Head of
Application Security, 1&1 Mail & Media Development & Techhnology GmbH

The bigger the company you're working in, the more technologies and
methodologies used by development teams you are going to face. At the same
time, you want to address security risks in an appropriate, reliable and
traceable way for all of them.
After a short introduction of a unified process for handling security
requirements in a large company, the main part of the talk is going to
focus on a tool called SecurityRAT which we developed in order to support
and accelerate this process.
The goal of the tool is first to provide a list of relevant security
requirements according to properties of the developed software (e.g. type
of software, criticality), and afterwards to handle these in a mostly
automated way - integration with an issue tracker being used as a core
feature.
Work in progress (currently targeting mainly integration to other systems,
automated testing of requirements and reporting) as well as future plans
will form the last part of the talk.

20:00 - 20:45 Presentation: *Less Known Web Application Vulnerabilities -
part 2 *- Ionut Popescu <https://ro.linkedin.com/in/nytro> - Senior
Application Security Engineer, 1&1 Internet Development Romania

Many application programs (including their testing strategies) rely on
rather simple standards, sometimes even as simple as OWASP Top Ten. This
often leads to a false sense of security ? developers tend to believe that
if they have worked their way through ready-made checklists and took proper
care of the well-known topics like authentication, authorization or using
parameterized queries, there should be no big surprises ahead.
Nevertheless, the real world of application security is way more
complicated than this. New attack vectors are being found on a regular
basis and security standards and vulnerability libraries tend to get
obsolete pretty fast. It?s nearly impossible to keep on track regarding all
vulnerabilities which an application can be vulnerable to.
The goal of this talk is to raise awareness about this topic. Several less
known security vulnerabilities will be explained, shown in practice and
mitigation strategies will be proposed.

Va asteptam!
