*************************************************************************************
Hello!

We are thrilled to announce the first annual *BSides Bucharest* *Conference*
 *made by **security enthusiasts for security enthusiasts.*

*BSides Bucharest* is part of the *Security BSides* phenomenon, a worldwide
community-driven framework for building events for and by information
security community members.

The idea of creating a *BSides Bucharest Conference* was born in early 2018.
 The team already organized 2 meet-up events with a huge success in the
community and now they are ready to launch the first annual conference.

The goal of the *BSides Bucharest Conference* is to *??organize a
sales-pitch free Information Security community where professionals,
experts, researchers, and InfoSec enthusiasts come together to discuss*??.
It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from
participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are
happening.

This year?s edition of *BSides Bucharest Conference* is a 1 full day
*Security *Conference with 1 *Capture the Flag* play-day contest, both
taking place on 23rd of November 2018 at *Romanian-American University
