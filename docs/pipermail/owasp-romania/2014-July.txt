Thanks  to Jonathan for getting the videos from AppSec Europe posted so
quickly. I can tell from the stats that the viewership is going to be
pretty good. As a little plug, the "Wait Wait!  Don't pwn me!"
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIS9fXZXJ44&feature=youtu.be&t=5h47m12s>
session was very popular, pulling a full how and a stellar panel.

You can see all off the videos  from the conference the OWASP  Channel
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG_KHsxepT9o6trkqDELhr3_>.

In  addition, I was able to get six really good interviews for the OWASP
 24/7 Podcast Channel and will start publishing those tomorrow.

Best regards,
Mark
