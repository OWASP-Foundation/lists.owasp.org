Hi, I have been doing a couple Maturity Model deployments (using both BSIMM
and OwaspSAMM) and I created the tool https://github.com/owasp/
Maturity-Models to help out

The app is already fully operational and I'm presenting it tonight at the
OWASP London Chapter meeting.

I would be great if you could give it a test drive and add some more data
to it (make it anonymous)

You can access the QA server http://138.68.145.52 with the OwaspSAMM
project located at http://138.68.145.52/view/project/samm

Please use the 'new team' link to create a new team

... which you can them populate using the 'table' or 'edit' views

 once you're done, you can check out the graph of what you have created in
'radar' view

... and the overall picture in the 'SAMM + Observed' view

Let me know what you think of it, and please use https://github.com/owasp/
Maturity-Models/issues if you find any issues or have any ideas on how to
improve it

Thanks

Dinis Cruz
