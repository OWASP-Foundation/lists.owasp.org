<PRE>Hi Prashant,
               Thank you for providing the space. Before setting up the date as 29th let us take few confirmations from the group as they are available or not as there was a huge gap between last meet and this one.

Let us see the number of confirmations and plan for the date.

Guys please block your calendars on 29th of this month for OWASP Hyderabad chapter meet and confirm. Based on your confirmations we will plan for the meeting.

Please confirm by 24th i.e., Monday may 2010 so that we can confirm for the meeting.

Regards,
Raj

Subject: Re: [Owasp-hyderabad] Hi all,

Ok, I can host the meet at our office in The V - Ascendas IT Park (The one just before the Inorbit Mall) on the 29th of this month.

Since Marc is going to be the presenting, I will leave it up to him to choose the time when we will be meeting.

The seating is available for 20 people.

However i need to know ahead of time, the list of people that are coming, so I can leave this list with Ascendas security and have them let you inside the campus.

Is there a Wiki where people coming can RSVP ? Should i create a group on meetup.com ?

Thanks for the reply Marc. You are going to make a presentation on &quot;vulnerability scanners&quot; ?

We do have a conference room that seats 16 ppl, so 20 can probably squeeze in.

If we pick Sat, 29th there is enough time to create a presentation.  So if there are others on this list that want to make a presentation, please reply.

I want the meet to be as useful as possible.  So more presentations the better!

It will also make it easy for me to make a case for using the meeting room in my office.

I have an idea that can go on the agenda of the meet apart from Marc's presentation.
We can go over the OWASP Top 10&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project</A>&gt;, and discuss some real word stories on how some of you solved them.

We need ~20-30 chairs and a projector. Snacks and tea are nice but not

required.



Right now, we just need someone who will say 'come to my office on this day

from that time to the other time'



By the way, can we pick Saturday 29th?
