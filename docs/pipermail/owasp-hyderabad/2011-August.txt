Hi Team,

           This is an invite to call speakers for the next OWASP hyderabad
session.

           Who ever wants to extend their valuable support and deliver the
session can send their brief and short profile with the topic they want to
deliver.
           We can have two to three sessions,One should be technical and the
other should be process oriented or managerial.

           We have good number of people who are ready to deliver sessions,
but to give an oppurtunity to all we are inviting in an open way.

Feel free to reach me anytime for any queries.

Regards,
Raj

Dear All,

          This is to request all who want to coordinate and sponsor for
space and refreshments.

Both can be one sponsor or two can share the things.

The sponsor can get benefited through helping OWASP chapter meet and help in
spreading awareness in the security world.and be privileged in the market in
the security circle, which will be appraised by the customers who are
security conscious. This even helps the individuals (employees) of the
organization to be up to date in the Web application security trends and
domain.

Please contact me on my mobile or you can directly send a mail to the group.

Regards,
Raj

Hi All,

      Here are the session details for the OWASP Hyderabad chapter meet for
August 2011.

I am happy to anounce that from this session onwards *only
professionals*can register and participate. As we will have a seperate
session with good
speakers for *students*.This change is to accomodate as many people as
possible. As we have grown big and to host session for more than 50 people
in a single session is not possible. so this will be a good oppurtunity for
students.*So please be noted that No students are invited for this session.
** *

*Time :*

Saturday, August 20, 2011 at 11:00 AM

*Location :*

Cognizant Technology Solutions, Gachibowli, DLF building 4th Floor,Hyderabad,
Andhra Pradesh 500081
 Event Details

All OWASP chapter meetings are free and open to anyone interested in
application security. The chapter organises meeting once in a month. We
encourage members to give presentations on any OWASP related topic and to
share their knowledge with the rest of the OWASP Hyderabad chapter.

*Agenda:*

Oracle Padding Attack by B. Satish

Open SAM part II by Sripati MS

*About our Speakers*

*B Satish
*

B Satish works as penetration tester in ADP, He has Huge experience and
knowledge over 5 years of experience in Penetration testing and Web
Application Security. His interests include Web Application Penetration
testing.

*Sreepati M S *

Sripati (http://www.sripati.info/) has little study, moderate & varied
experience (dev-2 yrs., security-4+ yrs.), and lots of aspirations (as far
as security goes, at least). He started his career in web-application
development, then took a detour towards quality compliance for some time (~6
months) and later moved to security compliance. Still learning the ropes, he
believes there is so much to learn and so little time! Interested in web-app
security (as if ISMS implementation is not enough), so that says something
about his guts! He thinks OWASP is a very good platform for web-app people,
and that since he joined OWASP, he has learnt a lot from people around him

why most trusted site(zone-h) banned in india(most ISP's)? because E2Labs? because Zaki Qureshey? 

source: http://www.zone-h.org/news/id/4740

As some of you prob?a?bly know, Zone-?H has been banned from some indian ISPs fol?low?ing the E2-?labs scan?dals and a?law?suit from E2labs and Zaki Qureshey in an indian court, who claimed our doc?u?ments and arti?cles were defam?a?tory (great joke!). 
Zone-?H was unable to defend itself as we didn?t receive any 
noti?fi?ca?tion from the court. What is even fun?nier (scarier?), is 
that blog?gernews?.net has also been banned? for writ?ing about 
the?case!
Check out their articles:
http://?www?.blog?gernews?.net/?1?24029
http://?www?.blog?gernews?.net/?1?24890
http://?www?.blog?gernews?.net/?1?26528
http://?www?.blog?gernews?.net/?1?26831
As you can see from the doc?u?ment they received, the block?ing is directly linked to the same court?order:
http://?www?.blog?gernews?.net/?i?n?d?e?p?t?h?/?i?n?d?i?a?/?i?n?d?i?a?3.jpg
http://?www?.blog?gernews?.net/?i?n?d?e?p?t?h?/?i?n?d?i?a?/?i?n?d?i?a?4.jpg
http://?www?.blog?gernews?.net/?i?n?d?e?p?t?h?/?i?n?d?i?a?/?i?n?d?i?a?5.jpg
http://?www?.blog?gernews?.net/?i?n?d?e?p?t?h?/?i?n?d?i?a?/?i?n?d?i?a?6.jpg

There is a?great arti?cle on the Wall Street Jour?nal about these 
deci?sions from Indian courts that directly attack free speech:
http://?online?.wsj?.com/?a?r?t?i?c?l?e?/?S?B?1?0?0?0?1?4?2?4?0?5?2?7?4?8?7?0?4?3?9?6?9?0?4?5?7?6?2?2?6?4?6?0?1?6?7?5?5?3?1?7?4?.html

Any?way this news is for those indian vis?i?tors that can?not con?nect to Zone-?H. You should know that the block is on the DNS of each ISP, this is why some vis?i?tors can visit Zone-?H and some cannot.
There are some workarounds, but first be sure that all Zone-?H domains are banned by your ISP: www?.zone?-?h?.org www?.zone?-?h?.net www?.zone?-?h?.com
The first workaround is to use a?dif?fer?ent DNS ser?vice, such as the Google DNS:
8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4

Sec?ond workaround: Use Tor, which also prox?ies DNS requests.

Another workaround is to use another Zone-?H domain, we will try to make var?i?ous DNS entries point?ing to Zone-?H. Just lookup the Zone-?H IP and point a?domain to it! An exam?ple of an unof?fi?cial domain: www?.zoneh?.co?.cc.

Other unof?fi?cial domains:
http://?www?.zone?-?h?.org?.org
http://?www?.zoneh?.us?.to
http://?zh?.ignorelist?.com
http://?zoneh?.i2w?.net

If you cre?ate other unof?fi?cial domains, you can send them to?us!

The overarching questions that any research on systems and processes must

the areas of security process improvement and operational resilience
management and engineering. The CERT Resilience Management Model is the
foundation for a process improvement approach to security, business
continuity, and aspects of IT operations management. It establishes an
organization's resilience management process: a collection of essential
capabilities that the organization performs to ensure that its important
assets stay productive in supporting business processes and services. The
model provides guidance for measuring the current competency of essential
capabilities, setting improvement targets, and establishing plans and
actions to close any identified gaps. This session is a curtain raiser to
introduce this model to HYDSPIN community.
