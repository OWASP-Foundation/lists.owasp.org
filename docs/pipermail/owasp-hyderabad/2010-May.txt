I don't see a problem why someone else can't hold the meeting. OWASP  
is all about knowledge sharing and imparting.
If the current organizer is simply busy with stuff, others who can  
provide the resources should step forward and organize the meet.

Hello All,

I am a new member of OWASP Hyd group. I work for Pramati technologies.

I would like to know what are the resources required and what would be 
on the agenda if we do meet up ?

I can see if i can convince my office to host the meet.

We need ~20-30 chairs and a projector. Snacks and tea are nice but not
required.

Right now, we just need someone who will say 'come to my office on this day
from that time to the other time'

By the way, can we pick Saturday 29th?

I really appreciate this initiative,
               At last after two months of long gap people started planning for a owasp meet.
Great guys, Let us have this owasp as a team initiative rather than a person nor a dependency.

Marcandre,
       Thank you

Prashant,
       Try your possibilities and update as soon as possible or we can have a meet at cycops or at any different location.

Regards,
Raj

Thanks for the reply Marc. You are going to make a presentation on 
"vulnerability scanners" ?

We do have a conference room that seats 16 ppl, so 20 can probably 
squeeze in.

If we pick Sat, 29th there is enough time to create a presentation.  So 
if there are others on this list that want to make a presentation, 
please reply.

I want the meet to be as useful as possible.  So more presentations the 
better!

It will also make it easy for me to make a case for using the meeting 
room in my office.

I have an idea that can go on the agenda of the meet apart from Marc's 
presentation.

    We can go over the OWASP Top 10
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project>, and
    discuss some real word stories on how some of you solved them.

Ok, I can host the meet at our office in The V - Ascendas IT Park (The 
one just before the Inorbit Mall) on the 29th of this month.

Since Marc is going to be the presenting, I will leave it up to him to 
choose the time when we will be meeting.

The seating is available for 20 people.

However i need to know ahead of time, the list of people that are 
coming, so I can leave this list with Ascendas security and have them 
let you inside the campus.

Is there a Wiki where people coming can RSVP ? Should i create a group 
on meetup.com ?

Hi Prashant,
               Thank you for providing the space. Before setting up the date as 29th let us take few confirmations from the group as they are available or not as there was a huge gap between last meet and this one.

Let us see the number of confirmations and plan for the date.

Guys please block your calendars on 29th of this month for OWASP Hyderabad chapter meet and confirm. Based on your confirmations we will plan for the meeting.

Please confirm by 24th i.e., Monday may 2010 so that we can confirm for the meeting.

Regards,
Raj

The seating is available for 20 people.

However i need to know ahead of time, the list of people that are coming, so I can leave this list with Ascendas security and have them let you inside the campus.

Is there a Wiki where people coming can RSVP ? Should i create a group on meetup.com ?

We do have a conference room that seats 16 ppl, so 20 can probably squeeze in.

If we pick Sat, 29th there is enough time to create a presentation.  So if there are others on this list that want to make a presentation, please reply.

I want the meet to be as useful as possible.  So more presentations the better!

It will also make it easy for me to make a case for using the meeting room in my office.

I have an idea that can go on the agenda of the meet apart from Marc's presentation.
We can go over the OWASP Top 10<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project>, and discuss some real word stories on how some of you solved them.

Right now, we just need someone who will say 'come to my office on this day

from that time to the other time'



By the way, can we pick Saturday 29th?

Hey Folks ,

Good to hear that there is going to be another meet.
I am travelling and will be back only on 2nd June so will not be able to
make it to the meet.
Anyday after 2nd June is fine to me.

Good luck !

Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] Request for postponement of meeting
Message-ID: <AANLkTinHUFnRUQzjBc2LM4Wws0GM5KkIGSkikSNUjsFM@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP Members (and Marc Andre in particular)

My name is M.S.Sripati and i am a member of OWASP hyderabad chapter. I have
a request to make. By any chance, can we postpone the meeting post-2nd June
2010 ? I got married on 16th of May 2010 and am currently out of station. I
will be back on 1st of June. I want to attend OWASP meeting, hence this
request.
However, i would understand if this request is not granted.

Thank you all and regards
M.S.Sripati

Here is the list of ppl that have RSVPed so far :

29th May :

1. Prashant
2. Marc
3. Raj Shalem Gaddala
4. Kishore Kumar

June 5 :
1. Prashant
2. Marc
3. Sanjeev Singh
4. Deepak Bhattad

So Raj, and Kishore, will you attend the meet if its re-scheduled to 5th ?

Can the owner to the Hyderabad Chapter please create a wiki page, so ppl 
can RSVP

If more ppl can respond to which of the Saturdays be favorable to them, 
it would be great!

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hyderabad#tab=Chapter_Meetings

It will be easier to track how many of the members are coming.

Hi Prashant,
               That's great work you are doing. There are few issues with owner and other wiki kind of issues in our chapter. You will come to know all these things in the coming meeting.

So guys there are only a few confirmations and lot of regrets. We will plan this for 5th of June 2010. The meeting place and agenda will be sent through the meeting announcement.

Please block your calendars for 5th of June 2010.

Dear OWASP Members (and Marc Andre in particular)

My name is M.S.Sripati and i am a member of OWASP hyderabad chapter. I have a request to make. By any chance, can we postpone the meeting post-2nd June 2010 ? I got married on 16th of May 2010 and am currently out of station. I will be back on 1st of June. I want to attend OWASP meeting, hence this request.
However, i would understand if this request is not granted.

Thank you all and regards

Hi Hrish,
          Thank you for your confirmation. But as lot of people are not able to attend the session on 29th may 2010 we have no other option left rather than postponing. Please be present on 5th of June 2010.

Regards,
Raj

Please give your attendance for 5th June 2010. Friends this is postponed for your convenience as this meeting is not a planned one, so let us make this happen once again on the date.

Hello All:

I was taking a look at what other OWASP chapters are doing when they 
meetup, trying to see if we can add any more content other than Marc's 
presentation.

Here is a topic which will be good cover in the meetup.

OWASP has published a Java web-app called "Web Goat 
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project>".

Here is the explanation, i copied from the website :

*WebGoat* is a deliberately insecure J2EE web application maintained by 
OWASP <http://www.owasp.org> designed to teach web application security 
lessons.

If any of the members that have RSVPed can spend some time to get this 
application deployed on their laptop and setup it up to demonstrate some 
of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilties --  that would be really awesome.

-Prashant
