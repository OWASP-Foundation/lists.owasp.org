Hi Guys,

Good to see some bubbles up.

I am actively working in application security space (have actively
participated in building Security in Development Lifecycle for more than a
year) for around 3 years now and have spent all 9 years of my career in
Information Security.

I would be happy to give time and kick start this group with a new life if
that is OK with everyone. I have always felt that a ground work is helpful
before organizing the meetings for the effective utilization of everybody&#8217;s
time and it is very important to understand the expectations of the
participants. I would request all the people that are still interested In
this group to send the following information to myself and the
administrator of OWASP Hyderabad (this is just to avoid the spam to
everybody&#8217;s mailbox).

      1)      Name and Designation
      2)      Company currently working for
      3)      Areas of strength relevant to OWASP
      4)      Learning opportunities as perceived by yourself
      5)      How do you think you can contribute back to the community if
      provided an opportunity?

I would circulate the information with everybody on the group and based on
the Learning opportunities as perceived by everybody I would love the
opportunity to draft a plan for our chapter for the coming 3 &#8211; 6 months and
make some progress. I would be happy to volunteer for the first session if
there are no other takers.

To not let this spirit die out it is must to have the feedback from
everybody by the EOD on Friday. I know that all of us are very busy
professionals but I think these kind of chapters really provide us
opportunity to participate in discussions and keep our self upgraded hence
I will appreciate if you all could spend 10 minutes and really think what
you expect from this group and How would you like to contribute.

Gaurav Gupta

Subject: Re: [Owasp-hyderabad] Hi!

Guys,

My 2 pence....

Good to see some dialogue on this forum after my registration confirmation
mail.
I have been a part of this community for a while now and have not seen
anything happen ever since I joined. It is possible that most are
traveling, or they are not based out of Hyderabad any more despite their
registration to this mailing list, or way too busy with their office
chores. Instead of waiting for some one to take an initiative and we
throwing our hat in. We can give it a start by at least attempting to meet
on a weekend and gather as many people as we can alongside and discuss in
person, what we can/should do.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and Regards,
Gouri Shankar
