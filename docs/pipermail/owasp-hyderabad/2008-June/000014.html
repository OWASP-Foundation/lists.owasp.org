Some of them I know meet at Coffee Day, Barista or similar outlets.
Personally I feel uneasy since there is always lot of noise around&#8230;probably
should be fine for the first meeting.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-hyderabad] Hi!

Guys,

July 18th is fine by me as on date.

We can possibly get a quick consensus of sorts on the date, at least those
of us who have spoken thus far.

Post finalizing the date, we should try and quickly freeze on a venue.
Given the Security Controls in Offices these days, Office space might not
be a viable option for meetings of this kind. We should consider other
options. Any idea on how are these meetings are conducted by other Indian
OWASP chapters.

Thanks and Regards,
Gouri Shankar

Dear All,





Thanks a lot Yogi and Venkat for your warm response.





I read the chapter rules a little late and it seems getting or distributing
the details of the members to the group is not allowed. I want to apologize
for the inconvenience and without breaking it further I would like
remaining


people not to share their details till we all meet in person.





I noticed these excerpts at the chapter rules link:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules</A> 





Privacy


The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should be protected.
Chapters should not disclose names, email addresses, or other identifying
information about members. Only aggregate statistics can be referenced.





Meeting Announcements


Local meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and announced 2
weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update the OWASP
Community page with meeting dates and times (this will be updated on the
main page shortly thereafter).





By going with the rules we should plan to meet after 9th July (i.e 2 weeks
from today). I will be out for an official tour so with certainty I can
vouch for a meeting on 18th July.





What do you all think about 18th?

Gaurav Gupta
