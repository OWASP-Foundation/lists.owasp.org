*Agenda and Topic:*


Session 1: *All about Java Deserialization Vulnerability*


Java Deserialization of untrusted data has been a security buzzword for the
past couple of years with almost every application using native Java
serialization framework being vulnerable to Java deserialization attacks.
Since it's inception, there have been many scattered attempts to come up
with a solution to best address this flaw. In this talk we will focus on
Java deserialization vulnerability and mitigation framework provided by
Oracle in its latest JDK.

than 13+ years of experience in Application Development and Security.
