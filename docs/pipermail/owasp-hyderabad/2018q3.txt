Save your shipping cost on door to door airfreight from anywhere in China to worldwide !

Below are our Door to door airfreight for cargo over100 kilos from our Shenzhen(China) warehouse to worldwide warehouse.

Shenzhen China to part of AsiaUS$1.99/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to U.A.EUS$3.98/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to Oceania:  US$4.26/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to United State: US$4.40/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to Mexico:US$4.69/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to Middle East:US$4.71/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to Western Europe: US$4.71/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to South America:US$7.06/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to AfricaUS$7.06/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)
Shenzhen China to Part of Eastern Europe: US$7.06/KG+ Fuel charge+DOC(US$25/BL)


For same shipments originated from other major cities in China, simply add on $0.38 per kilo on top of above rates. The minimum charge for inland pickup is $25 per shipment.

Here is an example how to calculate your door to door airfreight :

Cargo location: Shanghai, China
Destination: USA
Shipment weight: 100 kilos chargeable weight*
Freight charge:  $ 5.00/kg x 100 kilos = $500
Pickup from Shanghai to Shenzhen warehouse: $0.38/kg x 100 kilos = $38

Total charge: $500 + $38 = $538

if you are not sure how to calucate freight charges on a particlar shipment, simply email us your shipment information (weight, dimension of each carton ), we will be glad to send you the quote.


we look forward to hear from you.
