Hello All,

I am delighted to share the recent OWASP updates with all the members
here. After the OWASP EU Summit held early this month in Portugal,
OWASP has recently formed global committees
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Committee_Pages].

Puneet Mehta is now part of global chapter committee
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Chapter_Committee] and I
become the part of global conference committee
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Conferences_Committee]. This
is really going to help us in bringing further application security
awareness into Indian industry and invite the best application
security experts under a common platform.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv
OWASP Delhi Board
