Hey !


NForceIT, Cyberabad Security Council, Cyberabad Police Commissionerate &
HYSEA* presents*

CyberCrimes Devthon

My name is Naik, and I am the curator of the Cybercrimes Devthon
<http://devthon.org/edition/cybercrimes-devthon-busting-child-pornography-and-stopping-online-exploitation-iP6K2>
at the Cyberabad Police Commissionerate,Gachibowli, Hyderabad from Dec
13th-21st. Devthon is a co-creation event that brings together minds from
multiple disciplines to solve challenges and prototype new experiences by
blending the principles of design thinking, co-creation and rapid
prototyping into the process of making.

This edition of Devthon, we invite the best and brightest of the hackers,
designers, developers, engineers to team up with law enforcement agencies
and the government, and drive innovative technologies that can bust child
pornography and online exploitation by identifying predatory behaviour,
stopping online exploitation and staying a step ahead of the suspects.

You will team up with other bright minds and police officers to identify
challenges, develop tools and build solutions to enforce, audit and
investigate child pornography offenders. We will also have facilitators,
police officers and citizens who will be there throughout to be part of
bringing out innovative prototypes.

Additionally, the event will also present an opportunity for breakthrough
prototypes to be piloted by the Cyberabad Police Commissionerate.

There are no limitations on the technology use. For more details, please go
