Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] Light a candle for 26/11 and Show you remember
Message-ID: <8B8D04954D5D48A8B58A2D9933B1A3AD.MAI@home>

Hi  owasp-hyderabad at lists.owasp.org ,
 
I just light a candle for 26/11.
It is time to show that we have neither forgiven nor forgotten 26/11.
It is time to remember those who paid with their lives for the fanaticism of
a few, to salute those who gave up their lives trying to shield others, and
to honor those who survived the ordeal of terror.
It is time to light a candle, to show that as we move on, we cherish their
memories, we value their sacrifice and we hail their courage.
 
Please Light a Candle Now at: http://www.indiajaiho.com/LightACandle.htm
 
Warm Regards,
balaji reddy

Hi Prajwal,

            Please don't combine Null and OWASP.
They are all together different streams.If possible make a seperate session
and let us have some speakers for OWASP with Web Application Sessions.

OWASP rules doesn't permit to do so.We have to follow the ethics of OWASP

Regards,
Raj

Hi shalem raj,

I stand by you that OWASP and null are different streams but looking at the
irregularity of the meets and to have regular meets we decided to have a
combined meet.
It has been planned to have 1 session from null and another from Web
Applications by the OWASP group. Earlier months we have followed the same
pattern  However since there are no speakers from the OWASP group this
month, we are proceeding with the security sessions.
And also urge the OWASP Hyderabad members to have a strong participation so
that we can have a line of balance among these both sessions
Earlier months we have followed the same pattern

And we are not the first to have such meets in Hyderabad groups at banglore
and other cities also have combined null and owasp meets.

Further issues or suggestions you are always welcome to mail me
Regards

Hi prajwal and kishore,
        I don't think so. If you are capable of giving any presentation on web application security why don't you come forward and present that. Atleast suggest some topics for the people who can present it . We(cycops) have the place and resources for it. Why are you mingling other things with owasp. we can do nothing if we underestimate ourselves.

Hello Raj,

I agree with Prajwal. Let do it this way, to encourage more participation.

Hi Ray and others,

        Please find the link and go through all the aspects

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Chapter

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Leader_Handbook

in which we have rules for the Chapter to follow and chapter Leader
Handbook.

We are working with OWASP leaders regarding Chapter Leader.
OWASP is not a place where we can chit chat and speak about other security
issues which are of least concern.

Even if meet is happening.Where are the MOM of the meet and attendance.

We have not just left the meet like that. I am waiting for people who can
take some leadership in handling the team and team meetings.

I am everytime there to correspond.

Everything should happen as per the OWASP

*1Joining a Chapter*

2 Starting a Chapter<https://mail.google.com/mail/html/compose/static_files/blank_quirks.html#Starting_a_Chapter>

3 Move those Presenters!<https://mail.google.com/mail/html/compose/static_files/blank_quirks.html#Move_those_Presenters.21>

Materials<https://mail.google.com/mail/html/compose/static_files/blank_quirks.html#Chapter_Support_Materials>
