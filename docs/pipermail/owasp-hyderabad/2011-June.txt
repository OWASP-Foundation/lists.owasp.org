Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] from kate hartmann
Message-ID: <BANLkTimE8dfqNnVs8cObz4pefVkH+Hd9kQ@mail.gmail.com>

hey all,

this is the reply that i got from kate,


I have received three comments independently from each of you regarding the
leadership of the Hyderabad chapter.  I am very pleased to know that the
chapter is indeed active.



I have been in contact with the listed chapter leader, Sarath Kummamuru, and
he has indicated that he does not have the time required to run the chapter.



That being said, please move forward with choosing  a new chapter leader.
Once this is done, I will update the wiki page and the mailing list for you.



Please update the wiki page with any current or recently past chapter
meetings.



Thank you for your support and efforts.



Kate Hartmann

Hi all,

         Thanks everyone for your efforts, we really appreciate it. Let 
us proceed *as discussed* in the last  OWASP-Hyderabad meet. Raj, please 
update the wiki and mailing list.


Reply from kate (to the mail sent by Phani )

I had responded to three similar inquiries earlier today.  The chapter 
needs to select a new chapter leader and then I can update the mailing 
list information.  I have confirmed that the chapter leader listed is no 
longer able to run the chapter.

this is the reply that i got from kate,

 

I have received three comments independently from each of you regarding the
leadership of the Hyderabad chapter.  I am very pleased to know that the
chapter is indeed active.

 

I have been in contact with the listed chapter leader, Sarath Kummamuru, and
he has indicated that he does not have the time required to run the chapter.

 

That being said, please move forward with choosing  a new chapter leader.
Once this is done, I will update the wiki page and the mailing list for you.

 

Please update the wiki page with any current or recently past chapter
meetings.

 

Thank you for your support and efforts.

Hello Manik,

Webinspect is much better than Appscan since appscan shows up a lot of
false positives and the best web vulnerablity canner would be Acunetix WVS
+ Acusensor. Please the comparision file attached.

Dear All,
          As most of us are not available on saturday. Let us meet on sunday 11 am. I think that will be fine for all of us.

And let us start from the basics of Web Application Security. Corporate policies, Procedures and standards with respect to Web Application Security following OWASP Framework. I will be running you thorugh these.

Last but not least ---

This time let us discuss about the Chapter updates and "APPSec Hyderabad" (About having OWASP Global summit in Hyderabad)

Regards,
Raj

Hi Prashant,
              Thank you for the mail. The session is going to happen in the
month of July on 23rd.
You mistook the mail which was sent (The mail is an outdated mail which made
this confusion).

We will intimate you accordingly.

Regards,
Raj
