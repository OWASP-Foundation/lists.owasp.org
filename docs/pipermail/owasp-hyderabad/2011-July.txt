Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] Project Jugaad released
Message-ID: <CANn_Hrypf+Z6R4f8ria0+WXCK8ma4ibNz7AK81Z=ut+qiy-Jug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've released the first version of Jugaad library. 'libjugaad' enables a
binary to inject code (as a thread) within the context of another process on
Linux. It exposes a simple API which is somewhat similar to
CreateRemoteThread() on Windows and is very easy to use.



int create_remote_thread(pid_t pid,
                                     size_t stack_size,
                                     unsigned char * tpayload,
                                     size_t tpsize,
                                     int thread_flags,
                                     int mmap_prot,
                                     int mmap_flags,
                                     void * bkpaddr);

For the knowledge hungry and for people who missed my talk at nullcon 2011,
the detail paper is uploaded on http://null.co.in/2011/07/03/project-jugaad/.
If time permits I'll also post a video on the usage and internals of the
library on SecurityTube.

Why create the library?
Because there is no such (until now :p) functionality provided by the *nix
platform for remote thread injection.

Why this email?
A request to test / use the API. Appreciate feedback from people on what
distribution it fails or if there are any bugs - as I am yet to deliver it
at defcon 2011. Your contribution (a valid bug report) would definitely be
mentioned as contributor in my presentation.

Source code?
Details: http://null.co.in/2011/07/03/project-jugaad-2/
git repo: git://github.com/aseemjakhar/jugaad.git

Cheers,

Hello,

OWASP has recently announced a new membership model.  Now you might be able
to pay a discounted membership while enjoying the full benefits of a OWASP
member.  For example, the regular  annual membership fee is $50, but people
from some developing countries pay only $20.  To find out how to take
advantage of this discount, just send an email to your chapter leader or
reply to this email.

Benefits of OWASP members include professional association, voting rights
for OWASP elections, as well as discounted attendance at OWASP conferences.
For example, if you are a member, then there is no charge to attend AppSec
Asia 2011 in Beijing, China from November 8 to
11<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Global_AppSec_Asia_2011>
.

OWASP is a worldwide not-for-profit organization.  For the last ten years,
it provides free, open and unbiased application security materials to the
public.  Your donation supports your local chapter and other operational
costs.  To become a proud member today, please go to *
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Please_Join_Us* and then click on
the Donate Now button in the* Individual Supporters* table.

On behalf of Kate, It?s great pleasure to introduce *Shalem Raj* as OWASP
Hyderabad Chapter Lead.



Raj joins us around 2008, has unswerving in contributing to OWASP-Hyd
Charter constructively. Raj holds Bachelor?s in engineering and currently
playing a specialist role with Cognizant.  He is passionate in infosec and
his ISMS experience will benefit OWASP and the Committee significantly.

I believe your facilitation makes this chapter grow big in the globe with
his guidance.

Please join with me in wishing Raj to this role, and All the Best Raj.

On behalf of Kate, It?s great pleasure to introduce *Shalem Raj* as OWASP
Hyderabad Chapter Lead.



Raj joins us around 2008, has unswerving in contributing to OWASP-Hyd
Charter constructively. Raj holds Bachelor?s in engineering and currently
playing a specialist role with Cognizant. ?He is passionate in infosec and
his ISMS experience will benefit OWASP and the Committee significantly.

I believe your facilitation makes this chapter grow big in the globe with
his guidance.

Please join with me in wishing Raj to this role, and All the Best Raj.

Hi Friends,
           We are meeting this month on 23rd. Please block your calendars
accordingly. You can reach me/Core team as published on OWASP HYDERABAD WIKI
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hyderabad) or the organizer of this session
Srinivas makkena (makkena.srinu at gmail.?com) for any further details.

*When and Where*

*3i-infotech Ltd
*6th floor, orion tower, building no:9
Mind space( Raheja it park), cyderabad
Madhapur, Andhra Pradesh 500081
India
Saturday, July 23, 2011 at 12:00 AM (GMT+0530)
*Hosted by:*

OWASP Hyderabad <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hyderabad> is the Hyderabad
chapter of OWASP <http://www.owasp.org/>, the Open Web Application Security
Project, a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the
security of application software.

Our mission is to create awareness among individuals and organizations about
application security risks, penetration testing and secure coding.

All OWASP chapter meetings are free and open to anyone interested in
application security. The chapter organises meeting once in a month. We
encourage members to give presentations on any OWASP related topic and to
share their knowledge with the rest of the OWASP Hyderabad chapter.

*Agenda:*

Burp Suite by Omair

Open SAM by Sripati

*About our Speakers*

*Sreepati M S *

Sripati (http://www.sripati.info/) has little study, moderate & varied
experience (dev-2 yrs., security-4+ yrs.), and lots of aspirations (as far
as security goes, at least). He started his career in web-application
development, then took a detour towards quality compliance for some time (~6
months) and later moved to security compliance. Still learning the ropes, he
believes there is so much to learn and so little time! Interested in web-app
security (as if ISMS implementation is not enough), so that says something
about his guts! He thinks OWASP is a very good platform for web-app people,
and that since he joined OWASP, he has learnt a lot from people around him

 *Omair Mohammed*

Omair works as penetration tester in NII consulting, has over 5 years of
experience in Penetration testing. His interests include Network Penetration
testing, Exploit generation and Reverse engineering.

Raj

Hi Team,
?
After a protracted linger, Mickey mouse won the Game in APAC. Below is a 
astonishing occasion to become a honoured member of OWASP. Believe me the 
membership has lot of benefits to the individual such as getting discounted pass 
to the conferences where you can join hands with the world leading Security 
daemons to change the world bringing security hunger. I have personally got this 
experience after been to OWASP Summit 2011. Also a certain amount of this fund 
is used to the local charter to conduct security conferences, advisory and other 
activities that really promote OWASP. This amount has been proposed by me along 
with other APAC charter leads in the board keeping in mind of all of us to join 
as members of OWASP.
?
I hope you can very much utilise this opportunity and encourage your 
peers/colleagues to become a prestigious?member of OWASP and gets benefited. 
Please reach me for the Promotional Code to utilize this opportunity. 

?
Appreciate your passion in this regard. 
?
Regards,
Gandhi Aryavalli

Hi Friends,
          Thank you for the overwhelming response.We are really sorry to
stop the registrations as the logistics are only planned for 30+ and we got
response more than what we expected. and it got doubled (~60+).

We will plan accordingly for the next sessions and will try to host as many
entries as possible.

Thank you one and all. And sorry for the other people who wish to attend.

Regards,
Raj

Believe me the membership has lot of benefits to the individual such as getting discounted pass to the conferences where you can join hands with the world leading Security daemons to change the world bringing security hunger. I have personally got this experience after been to OWASP Summit 2011. Also a certain amount of this fund is used to the local charter to conduct security conferences, advisory and other activities that really promote OWASP. This amount has been proposed by me along with other APAC charter leads in the board keeping in mind of all of us to join as members of OWASP.
