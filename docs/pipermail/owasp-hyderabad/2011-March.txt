Hi All

This is to let all know of the happenings @ last meeting of OWASP. Some 
crucial take-aways were :-

1. For some time, OWASP meetings will happen every alternate week (i.e., 
1st and 3rd week) of a month. So monthly meetings from now on!
2. Every meeting will have some sessions (web app sec., of course!).
3. Sessions for next meeting are:-

     Clickjacking    -    Bhaskar
     OWASP Guide Overview    -    Sripati

Let's make it happen!

Regards
Sripati

Dear All,
          As most of us are not available on saturday. Let us meet on sunday
11 am. I think that will be fine for all of us.

And let us start from the basics of Web Application Security. Corporate
policies, Procedures and standards with respect to Web Application Security
following OWASP Framework. I will be running you thorugh these.

Last but not least ---

This time let us discuss about the Chapter updates and "APPSec Hyderabad"
(About having OWASP Global summit in Hyderabad)

Regards,
Raj
