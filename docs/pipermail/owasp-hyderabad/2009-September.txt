Good to be frank. I will most certainly be observing this list and
forwarding any/all invites to chapter meetings you have in Hyderabad.
Sad to learn that Accenture and TCS aren't participating. Hopefully this
will change.

HI All,

         Please intimate to your friends so that they also can attend
the meeting. As this is going to be a long weekend I feel 19/09/09 will
be better option for people who want to travel.

And it is upto the majority vote

 

Regards,

Raj

the meeting. As this is going to be a long weekend I feel 19/09/09 will
be better option for people who want to travel.

And it is upto the majority vote

 

Regards,

Raj
