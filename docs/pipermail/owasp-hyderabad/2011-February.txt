Please suggest a possible date. I request you all to come forward with

Hi,

I am sorry for replying to this thread a bit late.? However, here is what I am 
thinking about.? At this moment, I think either Raj or Gopal will take the 
volunteer to encourage OWASP- Hyderabad CharterGopal, pl confirm.

I'll reach Raj/Gopal on their numbers, or they can personally shoot a email to
