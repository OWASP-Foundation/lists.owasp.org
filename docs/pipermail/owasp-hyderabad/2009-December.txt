Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] With you a Very Happy and Prosperous New Year!
Message-ID: <4b3b303e.9613f30a.7fc0.1b19@mx.google.com>

Dear OWASP Members,

 

On behalf of OWASP India, I wish you very happy and prosperous new year
ahead. Let us catch-up in the new year with new vulnerabilities, exploits
and remedies. 

 

For those, who missed the Securitybyte & OWASP AppSec Asia Conference 2009,
slides are available at:
http://securitybyte.org/index.php/conference/conference-slides.html

 

2009 virtually ends today with party mood in the air! Have fun and good time
with family and friends.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv Soi
