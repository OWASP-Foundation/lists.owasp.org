The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) is pleased to announce the
long awaited release of the WASC
Threat Classification v2.0. The Threat Classification is an effort to
classify the weaknesses, and attacks
that can lead to the compromise of a website, its data, or its users. This
document's primarily purpose is
to serve as a reference guide for common attacks and weaknesses.

Main goals
- Refine document scope, terminology, and purpose
- Update existing sections when applicable
- Add missing attacks and weaknesses
- Creation of a firm, scalable base foundation allowing for the
introduction of data views allowing for various
  forms of data representation
- Addition of attack and weakness reference identifiers (WASC-<xx>)
- Publication of two data views

Hi Folks,

There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months.
Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days that helps
malware hop from one machine to another with its payload which most of the
times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites like Twitter and
Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to carry targeted attacks.
Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010 Threat prediction:
http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_predict_1209_v2.pdf


Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability and
detailed report has been published here:
http://torridnetworks.com/index.php/case-studies/50-information-security/139-malware-analysis-report-for-a-targeted-attack-via-word-document-carried-out-against-few-sensitive-email-accounts-belonging-to-elite-customer-of-torrid.html


Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all their
employees while using social networking portals which I think makes lot of
sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there something similar
happening at your organization as well?

Four and a half years later, virtualization is almost a mainstream technology. Surely it seemed that security would be a top issue in architecture, design and technology choice. 

As with any new technology there are new security issues to contend with. Entire network infrastructures now exist inside the virtualization layer, connecting servers.   

Sometimes we don't really see what our eyes are viewing. That's true with your computer screen, and it's true in nature as well.   

Businesses small and large are increasingly turning to virtualization technology to save costs and increase redundancies in case of disaster. 

Let us explore security challenges around virtualization by knowing the facts behind virtualization: 

?Virtualization may bypass secure configuration Standards 

?Security network scans may never detect insecure virtual servers 

?Information security must dig deeper to document virtualized IT environments for compliance requirements 

?Information security relied upon the slow rate of physical server deployment to ?stay secure? 

?What could be high risks due to virtualized environments

Dear OWASP's,

               Great to see so many confirmation but as always being a
Human being wishing and hoping lot more confirmation from all the
members of OWASP.

After all it's our meet. Come people as always let us make it a grand
success.

 

People who are coming please come with your friend that will lead us a
double dhamaka kind of thing:-)

Those who are not members of OWASP can also attend and subscribe later.

 

Regards,

Raj
