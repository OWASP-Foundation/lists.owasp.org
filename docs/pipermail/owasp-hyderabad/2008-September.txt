Hello Ravi,

Good questions!

I have recently joined Goldman Sachs and relocated to Bangalore in the
first week of September.

Though it was brief but I really liked talking to all of you and I
sincerely hope it does not die of it's own and someone take the
initiative to keep it alive.

Please let me know if I can be of any help.

Thanks,
Gaurav Gupta

Hi All,

Good luck Gaurav.

I think OWASP meetings should be person independent. Well that said we
should have enough to continue with the meetings. I have not been able
to make it after the first meeting. Those of us who are still
listening on this mail address and in hyderabad and interested should
try and meet up. Please speak up on the subject, we can give it a
fresh lease of life yet again. We can schedule a meeting and fix up
the venue as soon as we have enough voices voting for the same.

Request response from all interested parties, even though you are
temporarily out of Hyderabad.

Thanks and Regards,
Gouri Shankar

Hello All,
Firstly, wish you all the very best Gaurav. It was nice to have met you.

I am currently not in town and will be back in the second week of October.
However, I agree with Gouri Shankar that we should continue to meet. Once we
do that and we will come up with ideas on how to move ahead in subsequent
meetings. I did enjoy the one session I attended and hope we can have many
more.

Thanks and Regards,
Satish
