Dear All,

Hope you all are doing great! Its been almost a month from our last
OWASP meet and its been pretty hectic so far because of year end and
holiday season, hence delay in uploading the presentation. At last I
could find some time to upload slides of my OWASP meet presentation (
more details  http://owasphydoct2012.eventbrite.com/ ) on "A bird'd
eye view of securing Web Applications". You can find the presentation
at http://bit.ly/securewebowasp .

If you have any comments/suggestions regarding the presentation or
talk, please feel free to DM me on twitter at @imran_naseem.


Happy Holidays !


Regards
Imran
