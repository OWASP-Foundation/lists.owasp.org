most of the people are off the site and are available next week)

Please give your inputs. We don't have space constraint. But if it is a non

Hi All,

      Here are the session details for the OWASP Hyderabad chapter
meet for September 2011.

I am happy to anounce that from this session onwards *only
professionals*can register and participate. As we will have a seperate
session with good
speakers for *students*.This change is to accomodate as many people as
possible. As we have grown big and to host session for more than 50 people
in a single session is not possible. so this will be a good oppurtunity for
students.*So please be noted that No students are invited for this session.
** *

*Time :*

Saturday, September 24, 2011 at 11:00 AM

*Location :*

Cognizant Technology Solutions
4th Floor, 2nd Phase. DLF building, Opposite to IIIT
Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh 500081
India
Saturday, September 24, 2011 at 11:00 AM (GMT+0530)
Event Details

All OWASP chapter meetings are free and open to anyone interested in
application security. The chapter organises meeting once in a month. We
encourage members to give presentations on any OWASP related topic and to
share their knowledge with the rest of the OWASP Hyderabad chapter.

*Agenda:*

 Open SAMM part II by Sripati MS

TBD

*About our Speakers*

*Sreepati M S *

Sripati (http://www.sripati.info/) has little study, moderate & varied
experience (dev-2 yrs., security-4+ yrs.), and lots of aspirations (as far
as security goes, at least). He started his career in web-application
development, then took a detour towards quality compliance for some time (~6
months) and later moved to security compliance. Still learning the ropes, he
believes there is so much to learn and so little time! Interested in web-app
security (as if ISMS implementation is not enough), so that says something
about his guts! He thinks OWASP is a very good platform for web-app people,
and that since he joined OWASP, he has learnt a lot from people around him

Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] Request for Old Presentations (to be put on OWASP
	Hyderabad Wiki)
Message-ID: <CAGAfLY0DedXyorghBh6qReWuJQ7FKQ6EWXVSHpGUnJ68sPTEpA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Chapter Members

As part of our chapter building program and efforts, we have thought it
prudent that all presentations are to be uploaded on the local chapter wiki
(after due diligence by Core Team Members), to serve the following
purposes:-

1. Giving a bird's eye view of happenings @ the local chapter;
2. Giving the community back by putting the presentations online;
3. Visibility to the presenters who take the pain of preparing and giving
presentations to the community, thereby sharing the knowledge.

We request all the members who have talked @ our chapter meetings, to mail
their presentations to the following email ID (
owasp-core-team-hyd at googlegroups.com), along-with a short introduction of
the author. We will, after some small checks, upload the same onto the OWASP
Hyderabad Wiki.

Regards
M S Sripati
