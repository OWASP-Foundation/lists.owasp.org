<PRE>Hi All,

      Here are the session details for the OWASP Hyderabad chapter
meet for September 2011.

I am happy to anounce that from this session onwards *only
professionals*can register and participate. As we will have a seperate
session with good
speakers for *students*.This change is to accomodate as many people as
possible. As we have grown big and to host session for more than 50 people
in a single session is not possible. so this will be a good oppurtunity for
students.*So please be noted that No students are invited for this session.
** *

*Time :*

Saturday, September 24, 2011 at 11:00 AM

*Location :*

Cognizant Technology Solutions
4th Floor, 2nd Phase. DLF building, Opposite to IIIT
Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh 500081
India
Saturday, September 24, 2011 at 11:00 AM (GMT+0530)
Event Details

All OWASP chapter meetings are free and open to anyone interested in
application security. The chapter organises meeting once in a month. We
encourage members to give presentations on any OWASP related topic and to
share their knowledge with the rest of the OWASP Hyderabad chapter.

*Agenda:*

 Open SAMM part II by Sripati MS

TBD

*About our Speakers*

*Sreepati M S *

Sripati (<A HREF="http://www.sripati.info/">http://www.sripati.info/</A>) has little study, moderate &amp; varied
experience (dev-2 yrs., security-4+ yrs.), and lots of aspirations (as far
as security goes, at least). He started his career in web-application
development, then took a detour towards quality compliance for some time (~6
months) and later moved to security compliance. Still learning the ropes, he
believes there is so much to learn and so little time! Interested in web-app
security (as if ISMS implementation is not enough), so that says something
about his guts! He thinks OWASP is a very good platform for web-app people,
and that since he joined OWASP, he has learnt a lot from people around him
