Folks,

 

As you might already be aware, OWASP Delhi Chapter is organizing a grand
Application Security event in New Delhi. Please visit our local page @
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Delhi for further information on this. I just
thought to share this info with all the OWASP India Chapters so that we
don't miss out anyone for this event.

 

Please freeze your calendars and we look forward to see you all during the
event. As usual, special discounts and privilege will be available to OWASP
members :-)

 

 

Many Thanks,

 

Dhruv Soi

Founder & Director - OWASP - Delhi

Guys,

My 2 pence....

Good to see some dialogue on this forum after my registration confirmation
mail.
I have been a part of this community for a while now and have not seen
anything happen ever since I joined. It is possible that most are traveling,
or they are not based out of Hyderabad any more despite their registration
to this mailing list, or way too busy with their office chores. Instead of
waiting for some one to take an initiative and we throwing our hat in. We
can give it a start by at least attempting to meet on a weekend and gather
as many people as we can alongside and discuss in person, what we can/should
do.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and Regards,
Gouri Shankar

Hi Guys,

 

Good to see some bubbles up.

 

I am actively working in application security space (have actively
participated in building Security in Development Lifecycle for more than
a year) for around 3 years now and have spent all 9 years of my career
in Information Security.

 

I would be happy to give time and kick start this group with a new life
if that is OK with everyone. I have always felt that a ground work is
helpful before organizing the meetings for the effective utilization of
everybody's time and it is very important to understand the expectations
of the participants. I would request all the people that are still
interested In this group to send the following information to myself and
the administrator of OWASP Hyderabad (this is just to avoid the spam to
everybody's mailbox).

 

1)      Name and Designation

2)      Company currently working for

3)      Areas of strength relevant to OWASP

4)      Learning opportunities as perceived by yourself

5)      How do you think you can contribute back to the community if
provided an opportunity?

 

I would circulate the information with everybody on the group and based
on the Learning opportunities as perceived by everybody I would love the
opportunity to draft a plan for our chapter for the coming 3 - 6 months
and make some progress. I would be happy to volunteer for the first
session if there are no other takers.

 

To not let this spirit die out it is must to have the feedback from
everybody by the EOD on Friday. I know that all of us are very busy
professionals but I think these kind of chapters really provide us
opportunity to participate in discussions and keep our self upgraded
hence I will appreciate if you all could spend 10 minutes and really
think what you expect from this group and How would you like to
contribute.

 

Regards, 
Gaurav Gupta

Hi Guys,

Good to see some bubbles up.

I am actively working in application security space (have actively
participated in building Security in Development Lifecycle for more than a
year) for around 3 years now and have spent all 9 years of my career in
Information Security.

I would be happy to give time and kick start this group with a new life if
that is OK with everyone. I have always felt that a ground work is helpful
before organizing the meetings for the effective utilization of everybody?s
time and it is very important to understand the expectations of the
participants. I would request all the people that are still interested In
this group to send the following information to myself and the
administrator of OWASP Hyderabad (this is just to avoid the spam to
everybody?s mailbox).

      1)      Name and Designation
      2)      Company currently working for
      3)      Areas of strength relevant to OWASP
      4)      Learning opportunities as perceived by yourself
      5)      How do you think you can contribute back to the community if
      provided an opportunity?

I would circulate the information with everybody on the group and based on
the Learning opportunities as perceived by everybody I would love the
opportunity to draft a plan for our chapter for the coming 3 ? 6 months and
make some progress. I would be happy to volunteer for the first session if
there are no other takers.

To not let this spirit die out it is must to have the feedback from
everybody by the EOD on Friday. I know that all of us are very busy
professionals but I think these kind of chapters really provide us
opportunity to participate in discussions and keep our self upgraded hence
I will appreciate if you all could spend 10 minutes and really think what
you expect from this group and How would you like to contribute.

Gaurav Gupta

Guys,

My 2 pence....

Good to see some dialogue on this forum after my registration confirmation
mail.
I have been a part of this community for a while now and have not seen
anything happen ever since I joined. It is possible that most are
traveling, or they are not based out of Hyderabad any more despite their
registration to this mailing list, or way too busy with their office
chores. Instead of waiting for some one to take an initiative and we
throwing our hat in. We can give it a start by at least attempting to meet
on a weekend and gather as many people as we can alongside and discuss in
person, what we can/should do.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and Regards,
Gouri Shankar

Sorry to have missed out excellent thoughts from Gouri Shankar to meet
in person. I think we can plan to meet for an hour on this Saturday
itself and by that time we will have thoughts from everybody.

 

I stay in Kondapur and not really sure which would be the nearest and
cost effective place for everybody to meet up. If the company of any one
of us allows these kind of meetings then I guess that would be the best
way forward.

 

Suggestion are welcome and any volunteers for meeting place would be
highly appreciated.

Dear All,

 

Thanks a lot Yogi and Venkat for your warm response.

 

I read the chapter rules a little late and it seems getting or distributing the details of the members to the group is not allowed. I want to apologize for the inconvenience and without breaking it further I would like remaining 

people not to share their details till we all meet in person.

 

I noticed these excerpts at the chapter rules link: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules 

 

Privacy 

The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should be protected. Chapters should not disclose names, email addresses, or other identifying information about members. Only aggregate statistics can be referenced.

 

Meeting Announcements 

Local meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and announced 2 weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update the OWASP Community <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Community>  page with meeting dates and times (this will be updated on the main page shortly thereafter). 

 

By going with the rules we should plan to meet after 9th July (i.e 2 weeks from today). I will be out for an official tour so with certainty I can vouch for a meeting on 18th July.

 

What do you all think about 18th?

Gaurav Gupta

Guys,

July 18th is fine by me as on date.

We can possibly get a quick consensus of sorts on the date, at least those
of us who have spoken thus far.

Post finalizing the date, we should try and quickly freeze on a venue. Given
the Security Controls in Offices these days, Office space might not be a
viable option for meetings of this kind. We should consider other options.
Any idea on how are these meetings are conducted by other Indian OWASP
chapters.

Thanks and Regards,
Gouri Shankar

Some of them I know meet at Coffee Day, Barista or similar outlets.
Personally I feel uneasy since there is always lot of noise
around...probably should be fine for the first meeting.

Dear All,

 

Thanks a lot Yogi and Venkat for your warm response.

 

I read the chapter rules a little late and it seems getting or
distributing the details of the members to the group is not allowed. I
want to apologize for the inconvenience and without breaking it further
I would like remaining 

people not to share their details till we all meet in person.

 

I noticed these excerpts at the chapter rules link:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules 

 

Privacy 

The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should be
protected. Chapters should not disclose names, email addresses, or other
identifying information about members. Only aggregate statistics can be
referenced.

 

Meeting Announcements 

Local meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and announced 2
weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update the OWASP
Community <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Community>  page with
meeting dates and times (this will be updated on the main page shortly
thereafter). 

 

By going with the rules we should plan to meet after 9th July (i.e 2
weeks from today). I will be out for an official tour so with certainty
I can vouch for a meeting on 18th July.

 

What do you all think about 18th?

  Guys,

  July 18th is fine by me as on date.

  We can possibly get a quick consensus of sorts on the date, at least
  those of us who have spoken thus far.

  Post finalizing the date, we should try and quickly freeze on a venue.
  Given the Security Controls in Offices these days, Office space might not
  be a viable option for meetings of this kind. We should consider other
  options. Any idea on how are these meetings are conducted by other Indian

   Dear All,





   Thanks a lot Yogi and Venkat for your warm response.





   I read the chapter rules a little late and it seems getting or
   distributing the details of the members to the group is not allowed. I
   want to apologize for the inconvenience and without breaking it further
   I would like remaining


   people not to share their details till we all meet in person.





   I noticed these excerpts at the chapter rules link:
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules





   Privacy


   The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should be
   protected. Chapters should not disclose names, email addresses, or other
   identifying information about members. Only aggregate statistics can be
   referenced.





   Meeting Announcements


   Local meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and announced 2
   weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update the OWASP
   Community page with meeting dates and times (this will be updated on the
   main page shortly thereafter).





   By going with the rules we should plan to meet after 9th July (i.e 2
   weeks from today). I will be out for an official tour so with certainty
   I can vouch for a meeting on 18th July.





   What do you all think about 18th?

Soda is shaking in the cold bottles like us...we should help it come

I am good with 28th June at Barista Madhapur. At least those who can
come can make it to start it.

My sincere thanks to every body who had responded to the initial email
earlier today.

   Dear All,





   Thanks a lot Yogi and Venkat for your warm response.





   I read the chapter rules a little late and it seems getting or
   distributing the details of the members to the group is not allowed.
I
   want to apologize for the inconvenience and without breaking it
further
   I would like remaining


   people not to share their details till we all meet in person.





   I noticed these excerpts at the chapter rules link:
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules





   Privacy


   The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should be
   protected. Chapters should not disclose names, email addresses, or
other
   identifying information about members. Only aggregate statistics can
be
   referenced.





   Meeting Announcements


   Local meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and announced
2
   weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update the
OWASP
   Community page with meeting dates and times (this will be updated on
the
   main page shortly thereafter).





   By going with the rules we should plan to meet after 9th July (i.e 2
   weeks from today). I will be out for an official tour so with
certainty
   I can vouch for a meeting on 18th July.





   What do you all think about 18th?

My sincere thanks to every body who had responded to the initial email

Hello All,

Its really wonderful so see so much action in the group all of a sudden.
I
had registered quite recently to OWASP. I am a freelance developer and
have
delved into Web Application Security quite recently. I am also a
Provisional Auditor in ISO 27001 ISMS.

  Guys,

  July 18th is fine by me as on date.

  We can possibly get a quick consensus of sorts on the date, at least
  those of us who have spoken thus far.

  Post finalizing the date, we should try and quickly freeze on a venue.
  Given the Security Controls in Offices these days, Office space might
not
  be a viable option for meetings of this kind. We should consider other
  options. Any idea on how are these meetings are conducted by other
Indian
  OWASP chapters.

  Thanks and Regards,

   Dear All,





   Thanks a lot Yogi and Venkat for your warm response.





   I read the chapter rules a little late and it seems getting or
   distributing the details of the members to the group is not allowed.
I
   want to apologize for the inconvenience and without breaking it
further
   I would like remaining


   people not to share their details till we all meet in person.





   I noticed these excerpts at the chapter rules link:
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules





   Privacy


   The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should be
   protected. Chapters should not disclose names, email addresses, or
other
   identifying information about members. Only aggregate statistics can
be
   referenced.





   Meeting Announcements


   Local meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and announced
2
   weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update the
OWASP
   Community page with meeting dates and times (this will be updated on
the
   main page shortly thereafter).





   By going with the rules we should plan to meet after 9th July (i.e 2
   weeks from today). I will be out for an official tour so with
certainty
   I can vouch for a meeting on 18th July.





   What do you all think about 18th?

Soda is shaking in the cold bottles like us...we should help it come
out.....

I am good with 28th June at Barista Madhapur. At least those who can
come can make it to start it.

My sincere thanks to every body who had responded to the initial email
earlier today.

Hello All,

Its really wonderful so see so much action in the group all of a sudden.
I
had registered quite recently to OWASP. I am a freelance developer and
have
delved into Web Application Security quite recently. I am also a
Provisional Auditor in ISO 27001 ISMS.

Regards,
Satish

  Guys,

  July 18th is fine by me as on date.

  We can possibly get a quick consensus of sorts on the date, at least
  those of us who have spoken thus far.

  Post finalizing the date, we should try and quickly freeze on a venue.
  Given the Security Controls in Offices these days, Office space might
not
  be a viable option for meetings of this kind. We should consider other
  options. Any idea on how are these meetings are conducted by other
Indian
  OWASP chapters.

  Thanks and Regards,

   Dear All,





   Thanks a lot Yogi and Venkat for your warm response.





   I read the chapter rules a little late and it seems getting or
   distributing the details of the members to the group is not allowed.
I
   want to apologize for the inconvenience and without breaking it
further
   I would like remaining


   people not to share their details till we all meet in person.





   I noticed these excerpts at the chapter rules link:
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules





   Privacy


   The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should be
   protected. Chapters should not disclose names, email addresses, or
other
   identifying information about members. Only aggregate statistics can
be
   referenced.





   Meeting Announcements


   Local meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and announced
2
   weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update the
OWASP
   Community page with meeting dates and times (this will be updated on
the
   main page shortly thereafter).





   By going with the rules we should plan to meet after 9th July (i.e 2
   weeks from today). I will be out for an official tour so with
certainty
   I can vouch for a meeting on 18th July.





   What do you all think about 18th?

	Its really wonderful so see so much action in the group all of a

	I
	had registered quite recently to OWASP. I am a freelance
developer and
	have
	delved into Web Application Security quite recently. I am also a
	Provisional Auditor in ISO 27001 ISMS.

	  Guys,
	 
	  July 18th is fine by me as on date.
	 
	  We can possibly get a quick consensus of sorts on the date, at
least
	  those of us who have spoken thus far.
	 
	  Post finalizing the date, we should try and quickly freeze on

	  Given the Security Controls in Offices these days, Office

	   I read the chapter rules a little late and it seems getting
or
	   distributing the details of the members to the group is not
allowed.
	I
	   want to apologize for the inconvenience and without breaking
it
	further
	   I would like remaining
	 
	 
	   people not to share their details till we all meet in person.
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	   I noticed these excerpts at the chapter rules link:
	   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	   Privacy
	 
	 
	   The privacy of chapter members and meeting attendees should
be
	   protected. Chapters should not disclose names, email
addresses, or
	other
	   identifying information about members. Only aggregate
statistics can
	be
	   referenced.
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	   Meeting Announcements
	 
	 
	   Local meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly, and
announced
	2
	   weeks before their actual date. Local Chapters should update
the
	OWASP
	   Community page with meeting dates and times (this will be
updated on
	the
	   main page shortly thereafter).
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	   By going with the rules we should plan to meet after 9th July
(i.e 2
	   weeks from today). I will be out for an official tour so with
	certainty
	   I can vouch for a meeting on 18th July.
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	   What do you all think about 18th?

Gaurav,

 

I think participation from ACE team is wonderful and can provide the jet
fuel to make remarkable progress and create actionable items for the
group members. It will be a unique opportunity to share the real time
experiences of using Microsoft Security Best Practices and learn from
you guys to use them more effectively.

 

Especially threat modeling is something where there is a possibility to
create big difference and possibly help other OWASP chapters in the
longer run.

 

Meeting Details:

Time: 11:30 AM

Venue: Barista, Madhapur (Hyderabad)

 

Expected Participation (Add-on to the list provided by Gouri Shankar)

 

1. Gaurav Gupta, Dell

2. G. Yogeeswar, Polaris

3. Gouri Shankar Chivukula, TCS

4. Nataraj, Symantec

5. Praveen Illuru, Deloitte

6. Dhrani Raghuram

7. P Satish Kumar, Freelance developer and Auditor in ISO 27001 ISMS

8. Venkat Sanapala, Pari Networks

9. Microsoft ACE Team Member(s), Microsoft

 

 

Best Regards,
Gaurav Gupta

Hi Folks,

I am much delighted this morning after I see so many responses from you all.
Many Thanks to Gupta as prime mover:)

Right now I am  in Mumbai and working for Reliance Industries Ltd. I am into
Application security for last one and half year.
I would like to certainly meet you all, since it is a very short notice I am
unable to plan it out to come to Hyderabad this time. I am sure I would
certainly make it for the next meeting.

Thanks Once Again. Lets maintain the same spirit to share and enrich our
knowledge.

Best Regards,

Krishnam Raju M
