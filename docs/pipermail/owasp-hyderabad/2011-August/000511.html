<PRE>Dear Friends,

Today (ie., 25th August 2011), there is a seminar on CERT &#8211; RMM (Resiliency
Management Model) tomorrow between 18:30 Hrs to 20:30 Hrs at

This seminar is organized by HydSPIN, as part of their routine monthly
initiative. Since this model covers the business resiliency requirements and
covers most of the BCP standards exist today, I thought, this might be an
interesting session for some of our DSCI members.  For further details,
please see the below mail, from HYDSPIN.



Interested participants shall send in their nominations to
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-hyderabad">pradeep.ramjee at gmail.com</A> (coordinator of HydSPIN) directly with a CC to me,
due to shortage of time. Please nominate your team members, also if they are
interested to learn something since this model is evolving, as of now.

Regards,
Y Parthasarathy

*Overview of session*

The overarching questions that any research on systems and processes must
address are &quot;Have my processes made me more resilient?&quot; and &quot;How resilient
are we?&quot;. CERT, the home of well-known CERT coordination Center, is located
at SEI CMU involved in such researches. Since 2001, CERT has been working in
the areas of security process improvement and operational resilience
management and engineering. The CERT Resilience Management Model is the
foundation for a process improvement approach to security, business
continuity, and aspects of IT operations management. It establishes an
organization's resilience management process: a collection of essential
capabilities that the organization performs to ensure that its important
assets stay productive in supporting business processes and services. The
model provides guidance for measuring the current competency of essential
capabilities, setting improvement targets, and establishing plans and
actions to close any identified gaps. This session is a curtain raiser to
introduce this model to HYDSPIN community.
