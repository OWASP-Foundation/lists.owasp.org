<PRE>Hi All,

      Here are the session details for the OWASP Hyderabad chapter meet for
August 2011.

I am happy to anounce that from this session onwards *only
professionals*can register and participate. As we will have a seperate
session with good
speakers for *students*.This change is to accomodate as many people as
possible. As we have grown big and to host session for more than 50 people
in a single session is not possible. so this will be a good oppurtunity for
students.*So please be noted that No students are invited for this session.
** *

*Time :*

Saturday, August 20, 2011 at 11:00 AM

*Location :*

Cognizant Technology Solutions, Gachibowli, DLF building 4th Floor,Hyderabad,
Andhra Pradesh 500081
 Event Details

All OWASP chapter meetings are free and open to anyone interested in
application security. The chapter organises meeting once in a month. We
encourage members to give presentations on any OWASP related topic and to
share their knowledge with the rest of the OWASP Hyderabad chapter.

*Agenda:*

Oracle Padding Attack by B. Satish

Open SAM part II by Sripati MS

*About our Speakers*

*B Satish
*

B Satish works as penetration tester in ADP, He has Huge experience and
knowledge over 5 years of experience in Penetration testing and Web
Application Security. His interests include Web Application Penetration
testing.

*Sreepati M S *

Sripati (<A HREF="http://www.sripati.info/">http://www.sripati.info/</A>) has little study, moderate &amp; varied
experience (dev-2 yrs., security-4+ yrs.), and lots of aspirations (as far
as security goes, at least). He started his career in web-application
development, then took a detour towards quality compliance for some time (~6
months) and later moved to security compliance. Still learning the ropes, he
believes there is so much to learn and so little time! Interested in web-app
security (as if ISMS implementation is not enough), so that says something
about his guts! He thinks OWASP is a very good platform for web-app people,
and that since he joined OWASP, he has learnt a lot from people around him
