hi to all chapter members,hi raj,
                                            i think raj what you told is
correct as this weekend we gonna be having a long weekend its better we
postpone the meet  to next week 18th or 19th and that would make sure that
most of the chapter members can make out time from their schedules.It'll be
okay for me to attend any weekends,so count me in.

thanking you,

rajesh gopal
