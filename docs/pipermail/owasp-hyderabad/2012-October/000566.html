*Agenda:*

**

*A bird'd eye view of securing Web Applications* by Imran Mohammed

*SSDLC BSIMM* by M S Sripathi



*About the speaker(s)*



*Mohammed Imran*

Mohammed Imran works as Researcher at TCS, Innovation Labs. He also leads
the Null Hyderabad chapter and is the Board member of OWASP Hyderabad
Chapter. Imran is a CEH and his interests include application security
assessment, penetration testing and secure code review. When not at work he
practices horse riding and marksmanship.



*Sreepati M S *

Sripati (<A HREF="http://www.sripati.info/">http://www.sripati.info/</A>) has little study, moderate &amp; varied
experience (dev-2 yrs., security-4+ yrs.), and lots of aspirations (as far
as security goes, at least). He started his career in web-application
development, then took a detour towards quality compliance for some time
(~6 months) and later moved to security compliance. Still learning the
ropes, he believes there is so much to learn and so little time! Interested
in web-app security (as if ISMS implementation is not enough), so that says
something about his guts! He thinks OWASP is a very good platform for
web-app people, and that since he joined OWASP, he has learnt a lot from
people around him
