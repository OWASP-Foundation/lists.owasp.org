*Agenda and Topic:*


*Does your Pentesting cover all the basis of IT Security ?*

This talk focuses on how to align the security validation of a web
application with the three basic elements of security
namely,Confidentiality,Integrity, and Availability (CIA). The test
effectiveness can be achieved by analyzing the requirements of each element
and identifying the potential breaches that can compromise each element.
The efficiency should be built by relating these breaches with the known
OWASP Top 10 and other vulnerabilities and, leveraging that knowledge to
identify the testing approach - static and dynamic throughout the SDLC.
