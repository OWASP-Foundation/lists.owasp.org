<PRE>Dear All,

 

We kicked off OWASP - Hyderabad chapter with a new lease of life on last Saturday. Mentioned below are the Minutes of the Meeting. We are badly in need of a meeting place where it could be possible to have discussions in good professional environment and also a facility of a projector. It is a sincere request to everybody to enquire in your respective organizations and figure out a possibility of conducting meetings there. The proposed plan is to conduct the meetings twice in a month. With a small calculation if we have 6 people who can convince their organizations it will be once in a quarter in an individuals office.

 

Please share your thoughts with us. In the first meeting we had 5 participants and we sincerely hope to see more participation in the next meeting.
