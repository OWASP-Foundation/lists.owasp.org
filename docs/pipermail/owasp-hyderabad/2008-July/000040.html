Dear All,
&#160;
Thanks a lot to Raj to find out a decent place to meet on this Saturday. We may need to postpone the meeting by 30 minutes to accommodate for power cuts. We need to confirm the meeting to Raj so that he could proceed to arrange for the projector.
&#160;
I am taking the privilege to assume that we all will travel to this location and meet up. If anyone has a problem in traveling to this location, please contact me. We are expecting a good turn out for this meeting.
&#160;
I will provide you the complete address very soon. See you all there at the scheduled time &#8211; 12 Noon &#8211; 1 PM.

&#160;
Dear All,
&#160;
We kicked off OWASP &#8211; Hyderabad chapter with a new lease of life on last Saturday. Mentioned below are the Minutes of the Meeting. We are badly in need of a meeting place where it could be possible to have discussions in good professional environment and also a facility of a projector. It is a sincere request to everybody to enquire in your respective organizations and figure out a possibility of conducting meetings there. The proposed plan is to conduct the meetings twice in a month. With a small calculation if we have 6 people who can convince their organizations it will be once in a quarter in an individuals office.
&#160;
Please share your thoughts with us. In the first meeting we had 5 participants and we sincerely hope to see more participation in the next meeting.
