<PRE>Hello Raj,

 

If we do not have any good place to meet up by 19th July we will meet up
at Barista Madhapur. It is just below the ICICI Bank Madhapur Branch
which is next to Jayabheri Silicon County and opposite to VLCC. Hope
this helps.

Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] Minutes of First OWASP Hyderabad Chapter
Meeting

 

Dear All,

 

We kicked off OWASP - Hyderabad chapter with a new lease of life on last
Saturday. Mentioned below are the Minutes of the Meeting. We are badly
in need of a meeting place where it could be possible to have
discussions in good professional environment and also a facility of a
projector. It is a sincere request to everybody to enquire in your
respective organizations and figure out a possibility of conducting
meetings there. The proposed plan is to conduct the meetings twice in a
month. With a small calculation if we have 6 people who can convince
their organizations it will be once in a quarter in an individuals
office.

 

Please share your thoughts with us. In the first meeting we had 5
participants and we sincerely hope to see more participation in the next
meeting.
