Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] Minutes of First OWASP Hyderabad Chapter
Meeting

 

Dear All,

 

We kicked off OWASP - Hyderabad chapter with a new lease of life on last
Saturday. Mentioned below are the Minutes of the Meeting. We are badly
in need of a meeting place where it could be possible to have
discussions in good professional environment and also a facility of a
projector. It is a sincere request to everybody to enquire in your
respective organizations and figure out a possibility of conducting
meetings there. The proposed plan is to conduct the meetings twice in a
month. With a small calculation if we have 6 people who can convince
their organizations it will be once in a quarter in an individuals
office.

 

Please share your thoughts with us. In the first meeting we had 5
participants and we sincerely hope to see more participation in the next
meeting.
