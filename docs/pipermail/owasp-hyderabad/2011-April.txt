Hi Prajwal,

            There is no problem from my end.But the same thing happened last
time.
For your sake we postponed the session and no one turned out :-(

I hope once in a month this will not bother i think. But still we can modify
the date. Let me know the confirmations, based on which we can decide.

For now the meet will be on saturday.. based on your confirmations we will
conclude by tomorrow evening.

I think that will be good.

Regards,
Raj

Subject: [Owasp-hyderabad] Nice OWASP MEET
Message-ID: <BANLkTinegA=cZFwARY5sY8JgrziZZd3tQw@mail.gmail.com>

Namastey / Salaam / Sasriyakal /  Hi to all........

It was my first  OWASP meet and  for some of them also who attended  and for
the rest i was a 2nd meet after a  gap of  6 months.

It was nice meet and a good start.

Nice  to see  different people  from different organization's  comming
together and  sharing  their knowledge under one umbrella called OWASP
and  i am happy to be a part of it.

OWASP is really doing great job by bringing all of us together to share &
gain knowledge & experience.

I am thankful to OWASP Hyd for accpeting me as a part of it

:)

I am eagerly waiting for next session.

B-)

Hope it will be soon.

Have a good day.
