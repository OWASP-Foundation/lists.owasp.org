Subject: 	Opportunity to Syndicate the OWASP Austin Meeting

To: 	owasp-leaders <owasp-leaders at owasp.org>



OWASP Leaders,

I've heard through the grapevine that there are a number of chapters out 
there who for one reason or another have had issues coordinating an 
in-person chapter meeting. Last November I spoke with David Nester, 
President of the OWASP Houston Chapter, who had previously told me about 
their issue due to the size of Houston and the lack of a reasonable 
central location to hold meetings.  Fortunately, we have not had that 
issue with our OWASP Austin Chapter, but it got me thinking that perhaps 
we held a solution to this problem.  The OWASP Foundation now has a 
partnership with GoToMeeting which enables us to host webinar-style 
content to anyone with an Internet connection.  Last month we 
experimented with syndicating our OWASP Austin meeting via GoToMeeting 
and promoted it beforehand to members on the OWASP Houston mailing 
list.  The result was what I would consider a huge success with 20 
people signing on to catch the meeting.  Sure, there were a few hitches 
that we will learn from going forward, but all in all people seemed to 
be satisfied with the quality of both the audio and visual which we were 
also able to record and save for upload to OWASP's website later.

The reason why I mention this here on the Leaders list is because as the 
recently appointed Chair for the Global Chapter Committee, I have made 
it my personal goal to figure out ways to get some of our inactive 
chapters active once again and I think that it is this sort of thing 
that can help the struggling chapters grow without having to worry about 
speakers, meeting locations, etc.  So, with that, I'd like to put two 
things out there:

1) If you are a leader in a chapter that hasn't been holding regular 
meetings, I'd like to offer up a syndication of our OWASP Austin Chapter 
meetings to you.  We meet on the last Tuesday of every month from 11:30 
AM to 1:00 PM CST.  The GoToMeeting for February 28, 2012 is already set 
up.  You just need to promote it to your mailing list.  Here are the 
details:

    1.  Please join my meeting.
    https://www3.gotomeeting.com/join/807594710

    2.  Use your microphone and speakers (VoIP) - a headset is
    recommended.  Or, call in using your telephone.

    Dial +1 (773) 897-3015
    Access Code: 807-594-710
    Audio PIN: Shown after joining the meeting

    Meeting ID: 807-594-710

2) If you are a leader in a chapter that does hold regular meetings and 
are interested in syndicating them out for the general public, let me 
know and I can provide you with some instruction on how to do so.  It 
would be really cool to have the ability to "tune in" to a bunch of 
different chapter meetings at different times, on different days, and on 
different topics throughout the month.  Not to mention that we need some 
time variety for our international friends.

Sorry for the long e-mail, but I think that these kinds of initiatives 
are key for OWASP to continue expanding it's reach into some of the 
areas that we barely have a toehold on today.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
Chair, Global Chapter Committee
OWASP Austin Leader

Dear OWASP Chapter Leader or Board Member, 

You are receiving this email because you are listed on the OWASP wiki as the leader (or part of the leadership) of an OWASP Chapter. To ensure that all Chapter Leaders are aware of their responsibilities as well as the resources available to help them with their chapter, we are requesting that all OWASP Chapter Leaders read and agree to the revised Chapter Handbook (completed in December 2011).  The Handbook is available on the OWASP Wiki: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Leader_Handbook

Additionally, as a point of information, the funds available for each chapter (updated through the end of 2011) are available on the Donation Scorecard here:  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Donation_Scoreboard.  All funds are listed in USD and if your chapter is not listed, then your chapter account balance is zero.

Please submit your Chapter Handbook acknowledgement through this Google Form:  https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dF92bVI0bXRIUU85SHVwdUdlSHIyQmc6MQ no later than the end of February 2012. A response is requested from each member of a chapter's leadership team  and if we do not receive your response by then, we will assume you are "opting out" of chapter leadership going forward.  If no responses are received for a chapter, we will consider that chapter inactive.  Any funds will be donated to the foundation to support the Chapter Committee on a global scale.

Regards,

Sarah Baso on behalf of the
OWASP Global Chapter Committee

Dear OWASP Chapter Leader,

This is the 4th email (original below) that has been sent to you requesting acknowledgement of the revised chapter handbook and confirmation that you are still interested in continuing as chapter leader.  We have not received any response from your chapter and if none is received by the end of February (in one week), we will move forward with tagging your chapter as inactive.  This will also result in the funds allocated to your chapter being reallocated to help other chapters.

I suspect quite a few people receiving this email are new chapter leaders who don't think it is necessary to respond because they just started their chapter... We need ALL chapter leaders who are currently active to respond.

Thanks for your time in completing the google form: https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dF92bVI0bXRIUU85SHVwdUdlSHIyQmc6MQ
