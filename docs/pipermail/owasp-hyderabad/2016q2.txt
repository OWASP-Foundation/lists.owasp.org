Dear All,

            The attendees list is communicated to the session hosting team.
Request you to be on time to the session by 10 as there will be entrance
procedures and will take time.  Please maintain the time as this session is
organised and guests will be punctual and we should not make them wait.

A sincere request from our side. If someone wants to attend and still not
sent confirmation please send me immediately. As this is a SEZ location
security procedures are bit tough. Need your cooperation and kindly be
punctual.

Regards,
Raj
