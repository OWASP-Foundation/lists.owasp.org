Christian, that is superb! I tried dinking around in excel to make an
auto-scoring sheet like this before, but my excel-fu was too weak to figure
it out. Well done!
I think we might be able to leverage this to make some auto-magic scorecards
(or even roadmap graphs) too.

If I recall correctly, Colin, Nick, and maybe a few others were testing out
a few ideas for making the graphs. Guys, any news from those tests?

Hi Pravir,

That was the next step I was taking (i.e. turn this into the graph as
shown within the report) - but then my Sunday afternoon ran out. But I
really dig the project and if there's any other way I can help please
don't hesitate to let me know.

Cheers,

Christian

Pravir,

There is an attempt at an auto score card in the Interview Template, but
its not very good...  I actually had better luck doing it in Google
spreadsheets.
