When I interviewed Gary McGraw for the Cigital Podcast, I asked him a
question that I knew the answer to but felt was important. The question
essentially was: Do you know of any organization that has adopted BSIMM
where the CIO did not come from a developer/technical background? His
answer was no. If we look at the new world, we will see that there are
now more CIOs who haven't written a single line of code or even project
managed an IT project than that have. So, much of the "success" of the
build-it-in crowd, is neither portable across organizations nor likely
to be "quantified" since it was done using intuition. 

 

The ROI on the test it out side has a few advantages:

1.       Build it in, doesn't really have as many tools since it
requires more in the way of individual competency. For example, you can
have a tool like Rational ReqPro to capture misuse/abuse cases but this
is more about capture of all requirements vs. something infosec specific

2.       Where tools do exist, such as Microsoft Threat Modeling, they
lack "auditable" characteristics and tend to be useful only in driving
other conversations. Since MS doesn't license it (in terms of dollars)
there isn't even an ability to tell how frequent it is being used so
that analysts firms such as Gartner/Forrester could report on it

3.       All tools/vendors show positive ROI. If any of it were true, I
could run the entire IT department for a Fortune 100 enterprise by
myself for $1 a year while relaxing on the bench living the four-hour
workweek J Maybe the challenge here is to help people understand the
"financial" truth about web application security. 

 

Maybe we could help mature the build-security-in mindset by better
helping to connect dots? For example, is there merit in connecting a
Threat Modeling to say the OWASP Risk Rating method?

i agree 100%; "test it out" is both a business and a nonsense for all...
but management.

Sure it is highly repeatable; and further, i'm pretty sure that there is
more business to do with "build in" than with "test out"; but, for
convincing stakeholders or top management, testing output is much more
handleable.

i saw many IT projects chose keeping applications at risk, while
conducting assessments for leveraging budget the next year, by showing
off inherent risk to managers, risk and business owners.

Learning curve seems mandatory, and we need base figures, and that's
what i really miss actually..

Likewise, ROI calculators have been given last week by IBM or HP for
their "test out" products, but do we have kind of ROI for "built in"
tools/methodologies?

For instance, very few companies implement security from design phase;
likewise, solution providers miss it too: Microsoft's Threat Modeling
tool seems alone in these earlier phases?

basically, i find SAMM powerful for planning or proving.

It seems to me that the main purpose today is to prove; Appsec therefore
seems, from my point of view, much more often driven by "verification",
than by "construction" activities..?

We as a profession believe it is cheaper to "build it in" rather than
test it out, however reality is much different. The "test it out" crowd
has penetration testing which you can put in the hands of anyone and
perform point-and-shoot. Likewise, the after it is built "audit" crowd
loves their checklist. Maturity in the build-it-in requires actual
competencies and is a lot less repeatable...

Dear James,

Thank you.

The 80/20 rule you told will certainly fulfill the needs.

About partners, actually most of them shall not proceed to SAMM's
activities to deliver on time/on budget.

First time we talked about penalties for security flaws, we gave in the
SLA assurance level required on ASVS basis, or compliance required with
the Top10. And this seems to make sense for everyone.

Taking the issue by compliance seems to be more effective, as long as
software security still appear counterproductive.

But I will come back later to share some feedback about SAMM.

Thank you again.

I think we?re thinking along the same lines here with a number of OWASP projects, but with a slightly different twist.

 

To me, build-it-in vs. test-it-out is a false dichotomy since you need both.  I think the important distinction is between the positive and negative approaches to application security.  Mostly today organizations are following the negative approach. The focus here, across the lifecycle, is on attacks, abuse cases, vulnerability, impact, and risks. Essentially these organizations are managing insecurity.

 

By contrast, the positive approach focuses on security requirements, establishing controls, verification, completeness, and assurance.  This is where we are heading with ASVS, Developer?s Guide, the Prevention Cheat Sheet series, and ESAPI.  This view allows us to manage secure and assurance.

 

See the difference?  There are so many things that can go wrong that the negative approach doesn?t provide much assurance.  The positive approach is simpler to manage because the number of security controls is smaller.  In particular, the verification effort changes from ?hacking ourselves secure? to verifying that the proper controls are in place, work correctly, and are used properly.

 

I?m not a zealot about this ? there?s a lot of value in the negative approach to security.  But I think the market is very lopsided today, with virtually all the effort being put towards measuring insecurity and reacting.

BSIMM2 doesn't explore the background of the CIO or other types (i.e.
VP Risk, CSO, etc) reporting manager and there is not what to
objectively benchmark "background".  That stated, BSIMM2 does cover
were the reporting line of the SSG on within the Executive Leadership
i.e. on p6

The CIO role is evolving to that of a CFO and this to manage the
residual risk of the failures to deliver technical project.  Hence
their scope is much greater then the SSG and hence their selection of
their maturity model is different i.e. COBIT, CMMI, etc

> Maybe we could help mature the build-security-in mindset by better helping to connect dots? For example, is there merit in connecting a Threat Modeling to say the OWASP Risk Rating method?

The failure in trying to adopt specific activities is due to culture
lacking maturity.

... and the application of these controls adjust the inherent risk to
produce the residual risk.

That stated, to implement these controls requires a highly matured
development culture.  Otherwise the project manager will accept the
residual risk by signing an exception wavier to meet the deadline in
order to receive their bonus and by the time the vulnerability are
disclosed the project manager has moved on and is therefore

The root cause of this observation in immature development culture and
can be correlated by reviewing the:
1. Real world data of the conclusions drawn by BSIMM (i.e. from p49)
2. The activities conducted at Level 1 of both OpenSAMM and BSIMM

Subsequently, an immature development culture will resist a controls
based approach i.e. ASVS, ESAPI which is the similar to the resistance
to both ISO 27001 and PCI i.e. controls based.

Hence, the approach with the most chance of success is to measure the
maturity and then determine what controls will be accepted today or
introduced at a later period by the development culture

Jeff,

As I am finalising my slides for
http://www.opensamm.org/2010/09/opensamm-in-sydney-australia-6th-october/
for review tomorrow, the following is relevant to my prior e-mail as
quoted from BSIMM v1.5 p52 or p55 (PDF Page Numbering):

?The largest deltas appear in the Training and Security Testing practices.

There are three practices where the European companies show evidence
of more activity: Compliance and Policy, Penetration Testing, and
Software Environment.

When it comes to Strategy and Metrics, the averages are exactly the same.

In general, this reflects a European situation that is more process
and compliance driven (including privacy compliance) and more driven
to measurement.

However, the Europeans tend to carry out fewer assurance activities
(for example, reviewing source code to look for bugs) and instead
focus more energy getting a handle on the problem and meeting
compliance criteria through penetration testing.?

Well, that is the traditional way to view the problem.  And it leads exactly to the situation most companies are in -- continuous vulnerability chasing.

There's a difference between compliance and providing actual security mechanisms. ESAPI is succeeding because it makes application security easier - training, rqmts, architecture, implementation, verification, and remediation.  I see no resistance to ESAPI in organization - even immature ones - in fact quite the opposite.

That stated, to implement these controls requires a highly matured development culture.  Otherwise the project manager will accept the residual risk by signing an exception wavier to meet the deadline in order to receive their bonus and by the time the vulnerability are disclosed the project manager has moved on and is therefore unaccountable.

ASVS recommends a specific TOV based on the measurement of inherent risk.

Furthermore,  http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project
2010 Release was promoted as "... managing risk, not just avoiding
vulnerabilities" and "To manage these risks, organizations need an
application risk management program ..."

The contention is the reference to "risk management" above and that
"risk management" is practiced in companies regardless of their level
of maturity.

To quote http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project
again "?we?ll never hack our way secure ? it?s going to take a culture
change? for organizations to properly address application security"
i.e. "culture change" is the same as increasing the maturity.

I know of someone in Australia whose implementations of ISO 27001 are
based on leveraging the COBIT Maturity Model and CMMI to create a ITIL
governance framework based on SLA.

Outside of Aspect Security i.e.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API#tab=Here.27s_what_I_did_with_ESAPI
- are their any reference implementations of production software being
shipped leveraging ESAPI that you could provide?

I believe that the use of replacement API which provide some form of
security should be considered an activity of both OpenSAMM and BSIMM
but they might already be address by an existing activity - thoughts?

1. Catching up on my backlog of reading. Currently reading the ISACA IT Risk Framework and looking at the metrics section where they have broken down metrics into activity and process metrics. Should we have a similar classification scheme?

2. Could someone be really good at software assurance but otherwise have poor showing on ISACA risk? If so, should we provide additional guidance on where good infosec deviates from traditional control thinking? For example, if we decide to put federated identity into a system, yet the audit control framework says look for change password evidence every sixty days...

3. Is there an opportunity for us to get SAMM visually represented into GRC frameworks such as Archer? 

4. Some guidance on how an organization may express risk appetite may be in order. For example, are there types of applications that need a different profile than others (e.g. internet facing, PCI, financial, etc) and that goodness can be had by being less mature vs. being wholesale applied and penalized because the Chinese Lunch ordering system is subject to CSRF

5. Should we have some measure of the maturity of escalation when things decline? Which things are developer-scoped vs. which things are CIO-scoped?

6. Should we somehow be able to merge SAMM with a RACI matrix to understand organizational alignment?

IIRC, you were going to (or already have done) an AISA talk about the correlation between SAMM and BSIMM... Am I remembering that correctly? If so, can you share the preso or any related materials? 

I was working on an activity-to-activity mapping between the two models a while back, so that might be complimentary. I'll see if I can get the time to get it cleaned up and shareable in the next couple weeks.

I was working on an activity-to-activity mapping between the two models a while back, so that might be complimentary. I'll see if I can get the time to get it cleaned up and shareable in the next couple weeks.

Pravir, and others,

I did a similar comparison some weeks ago (activity level). I'd be happy to join this discussion. I can definitely share the result (excel file), but better in small group as it is currently not (meant to be) publication quality material :-)

Best,
Bart.

James

Dinis Cruz spoke with people from ENISA and the Cloud Security
Alliance at OWASP AppSec Iberia 2009, and subsequentlyt OWASP were
asked to contribute to the development of a "Common Assurance Maturity
Model (CAMM)".  This is an ongoing effort:

   http://www.common-assurance.com/

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:ENISA_Cloud_Computing_Common_Assurance_Metrics

We were asked to provide objectives and controls for the "development
and acquisition" sub-domain linked to other standards such as
ISO27001:2007, PCIDSS 1.2, COBIT 4.1 and SANS Top 25.  We actually
based our input primarily around SAMM, and also looked at BSIMM and
SAFEcode for any gaps.  The structure, wording and actual focus is
subject to change and is being decided by others (reviewers and
steering committee), but we have made a start at integrating SAMM.

I presented the statistics published from BSIMM i.e.
http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/bsimm as an introduction to application
security maturity models i.e. what activities the USA and European
cultures have implemented.

Yes definitely - based on my current schedule I am intending to
publish some further research throughout October and November and then
correlation this into a publishable draft to allow for a comment
period from December until early second quarter 2011 prior to
releasing the final version - let me know your thoughts on this
proposed scheduling?

Yes - lets work on this collectively.

Your excel spreadsheet could be used to QA the conclusions that I will
be publishing throughout October and November without needing to
release your spreadsheet.

Please let me know your thoughts?

Pravir,

I found a (non) typographic error introduced when displayed in Preview
(OSX) on p39 i.e. PC1.B of?SAMM-1.0-en_US.pdf as per the attached PNG.

If it is cut and paste from the PDF then it is displayed without this
typographic error i.e. "... practices.[SPACE]Also ..."

Please let me know if an issues register is available and I will lodge
other typographic errors like this if I find anymore?

Subject: [SAMM] CLASP vs SAMM
Message-ID: <fb99f8665640.4ccd5589@shaw.ca>

I was interested to see a chapter covering CLASP in Mark Merkow and Laksh Raghanvan's new book "Secure and Resilient Software Development". This raised some questions about the state of support for CLASP and its roadmap. I was under the impression that CLASP was going to be replaced over time by SAMM: as Pravir called SAMM "CLASP on steroids" at one point. I thought that CLASP was going to be orphaned as a result.

Now I understand that SAMM is at its core a maturity model not a secure SDLC so this was confusing to me at the time and still is confusing. I've been following both mailing lists for some time now (there has been essentially nothing on CLASP in a long time so it hasn't been distracting).CLASP doesn't seem to be actively maintained and isn't keeping up with the other mainline initiatives at OWASP. SAMM has much more momentum behind it, and is a more active project. But I don't see how the two projects will converge.

To be honest I was surprised that a brand new book would reference CLASP. As a software developer looking for a secure SDLC for a reference, it makes a lot more sense to work with Microsoft's SDL than CLASP given that SDL is more current and complete and has a lot more resources and momentum. Is CLASP still alive? And how are CLASP and SAMM supposed to fit together?

Mike,

Another thought - you might be able to integrate DISA ASD STIG within
"Policy and Compliance" i.e. p39 - p41

The original idea was to try to build all of these into SAMM itself.

What I really like about Mike's ?suggestion is that we could organize such a companion doc as a specialized set of levels across the 12 practices. If there is overlap with existing levels and activities, it's easy to make those references into the "core" SAMM material from the companion guide. If there's anything really unique in the external standard (goodness as James puts it), we can work it back into the next release of the SAMM framework.

This workflow is kindof key in my opinion since it would allow multiple people to collaborate easily. For instance, we've had a bunch of volunteers offer to map SAMM to PCI, but no one ever crossed the finish line since they were all working independently (and no one ever sent me their partial work to hand to the next person that wants to tackle that task).
