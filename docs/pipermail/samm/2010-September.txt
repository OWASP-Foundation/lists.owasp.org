Subject: [SAMM] Suggestion for enhancement to extend OpenSAMM for use by US
 DoD app developers
Message-ID: <21D3693DA55EF14BB72DCC18FB65B291024BBD2639@ASHBMBX04.resource.ds.bah.com>

Hi,

I would like to suggest the following enhancement to extend OpenSAMM to adapt it for use by US DoD custom app developers who have very specific application security compliance requirements:

Just as there are e.g. SM1, SM2, SM3 which are generic in nature for each business function, I would like to suggest the addition of e.g. SM1, SM2, SM3, SM-DoD; PC1, PC2, PC3, PC-DoD; EG1, EG2, EG3, EG-DoD; and so on, spanning OpenSAMM, where the additional component is specific to DISA 's Application Security and Development STIG requirements.

The "Results" list then contains mapped functionality/docs/activities; the "Add'l Success Metrics" list then contains corresponding CAT severity of mapped functionality/docs/activities; costs and personnel stay the same, perhaps ideally replaced with Gov't-speak versions of terminology/roles. Perhaps add an additional "Prescribed Solutions" under "Personnel" before "Related Levels", that would do things like say use NIST validated this, NSA allowed that, use DoD PKI, etc.

The idea would be that one could then use OpenSAMM as supporting material to help guide a dev team through make preparations to comply with DISA 's Application Security and Development STIG.

Best,

Mike B.

Mike,

I briefly reviewed the DISA ?s Application Security and Development
STIG  and it would appear to be more applicable to ASVS (i.e.
controls) rather then OpenSAMM (i.e. maturity).  In your opinion, is
there something missing from OpenSAMM that is included in DISA?s
Application Security and Development STIG from a maturity perspective?

OpenSAMM is intended audience is any organisation regardless of their
size and/or market vertical, i.e. not just but including the US DoD.
I have started to "bridge" various webappsec governance frameworks
into the ISMS (i.e. ISO 2700x) for the NSW State Government which I
believe is what you are proposing for the US DoD?

Hi Christian. The ASD STIG spans code, documentation, and lifecycle activities. Am suggesting a tailored extension to the OpenSAMM framework to assist dev teams attempting to make preparations to meet ASD STIG requirements by serving as a tailored handbook. Am perhaps incidentially providing an example of how OpenSAMM could be tailored for a given organization. The use case is a dev team is building something and it is subject to the ASD STIG among other STIGs, so they need to make deliberate preparations to comply, and such preparations can be explained in (closer to) plain english and for example teams can be organized according to OpenSAMM's taxonomy of business functions and activities, since the ASD STIG is otherwise an unsorted crazy quilt of different types of requirements, and dev teams subject to STIG requirements otherwise generally approach compliance as a panicked and unstructured exercise. I'm aware of all the various references. Such an extension certainly could/should be tied back to other OWASP solutions and also COTS and GOTS tools.

Michael,

Would conformance to DISA ?s Application Security and Development STIG
require a reduction of the scope of OpenSAMM?

If so, then the preferred outcome would be to consider OpenSAMM rather
then have their maturity increased so that they conform to a limited
number of controls specified in DISA ?s Application Security and
Development STIG.

Perhaps you could provide an example(s) of where OpenSAMM does not
provide guidance to a specific section(s) of the DISA ?s Application
Security and Development STIG?

I am somewhat intrigued by the notion of documentation maturity. Some days I wake up and believe the thought that code is documentation. On other days, I ask myself if we as IT professionals consistently blow deadlines and budgets as a profession and on top of that deliver low-fidelity documentation that this is outright criminal. While documentation will not help in finding SQL injection, it "may" be useful in identifying business logic flaws...

More thoughts on documentation maturity:

1. We need to acknowledge that low quality or missing documentation is the major cause of errors in software. We should noodle the implications of documentation handed to developers by business analysts before software is written and documentation that is turned over to operations folks by developers. The former could lead to business logic flaws while the later could lead to mis-configuration. At the process level, can a team skip producing documentation because they are jammed and still be considered mature according to SAMM?

2. I do believe that in order to have a consistent security posture, you need to document software consistently throughout the lifecycle. Templates for how BA's capture requirements with a taxonomy of business requirements traceable to technical requirements traceable to system requirements is a good thing.

3. What happens when code gets out of sync from documentation? Could users introduce other unintended system behaviors especially in the more popular paradigm of meta-data driven applications that change the security model?

4. Should documentation be version-controlled at the same level as code or is it OK to throw it up on SharePoint?

5. In our throw it over the wall outsourcing culture. What would happen if James McGovern of The Hartford decided to introduce a backdoor as a specification into an application he wasn't authorized to work on. I can tell you that it would seamlessly flow thru the process and even get tested for whether it actually worked :-)

There is goodness in so far as getting people to think about "things owed" as evidence of having done something. That's besides the point, though.

To maybe put it another way, I'd love to see extra buttons to the right of the existing three besides an extra DoD one, perhaps PCI, other. Am talking about tailored versions for specific verticals that otherwise explain and lay out things the way OpenSAMM already does.

I have an immediate need for a DoD "button" and thus am offering a measure of support to support the creation a first worked example of such tailoring.

Best,

Mike B.

Is there goodness in the DoD recommendations that are useful to us that aren't working in the federal government? If so, why miss out on an opportunity to make relevant to all parties...

I actually wasn't thinking such deep thoughts, or proposing anything super-fancy. I just am proposing some extra buttons to click on on the web version that are DoD specific in terms of their guidance, just copy existing SAMM pages over, and mark them up accordingly.

More thoughts on documentation maturity:

1. We need to acknowledge that low quality or missing documentation is the major cause of errors in software. We should noodle the implications of documentation handed to developers by business analysts before software is written and documentation that is turned over to operations folks by developers. The former could lead to business logic flaws while the later could lead to mis-configuration. At the process level, can a team skip producing documentation because they are jammed and still be considered mature according to SAMM?

2. I do believe that in order to have a consistent security posture, you need to document software consistently throughout the lifecycle. Templates for how BA's capture requirements with a taxonomy of business requirements traceable to technical requirements traceable to system requirements is a good thing.

3. What happens when code gets out of sync from documentation? Could users introduce other unintended system behaviors especially in the more popular paradigm of meta-data driven applications that change the security model?

4. Should documentation be version-controlled at the same level as code or is it OK to throw it up on SharePoint?

5. In our throw it over the wall outsourcing culture. What would happen if James McGovern of The Hartford decided to introduce a backdoor as a specification into an application he wasn't authorized to work on. I can tell you that it would seamlessly flow thru the process and even get tested for whether it actually worked :-)

Hey Christian.

If you can share any of that "bridge" work you've done with ISO, SAMM, and other webappsec standards, I would love to see it... And let me know if you'd like to spearhead a mapping exercise for one of those into SAMM to build up a companion guide!

Now this is very interesting food for thought, James. Though, it's probably a separate conversation from what Mike is after.

My first question when it comes to documentation maturity is: Does this belong in a framework promoting software security assurance, or is this something covered by other maturity models that are focused on improving sw dev itself. From your points below, I can certainly see some justification for either answer. The tricky part about something like SAMM, tho, is that ideally, *all* the practices in SAMM would just be part of normal dev lifecycle models. But the world's not ideal, so we write down "security stuff" separately from "normal stuff" but the line is fuzzy. 

We tried not to cross the fuzzy line with SAMM 1.0 so that we didn't get into conflicts with any existing dev process models, thus keeping the audience as broad as it could be (i.e. anyone building software). I fear treading into doc maturity too far may overstep this project's "security" flavor, but I'm definitely for tying in activities or language that prevent doc-related vulnerabilities or compromised specs. Just not sure how we'd reasonably tell people to prevent those things :)

Just my $0.02.

Hey Mike.

I just caught up on this thread, and I'm totally in agreement on the value of such DoD extensions (and, for that matter, extensions to any other appsec standard that exists). The original idea was to try to build all of these into SAMM itself. But, after identifying a short list of candidates, it became pretty obvious to me that doing so would make the doc pretty unwieldy. 

So, the latest thought to solve this was to try to pull the mapping and extra details related to a given standard into a "companion guide" of sorts. Think "SAMM Companion for DISA ASD STIG". What I really like about Mike's  suggestion is that we could organize such a companion doc as a specialized set of levels across the 12 practices. If there is overlap with existing levels and activities, it's easy to make those references into the "core" SAMM material from the companion guide. If there's anything really unique in the external standard (goodness as James puts it), we can work it back into the next release of the SAMM framework.

Another good thing about Mike's suggestion is that we could use the OWASP wiki to build out the specialized levels, then once we're happy with the set of 12, we can spin it into a doc (with a little front matter) and publish to the world. This workflow is kindof key in my opinion since it would allow multiple people to collaborate easily. For instance, we've had a bunch of volunteers offer to map SAMM to PCI, but no one ever crossed the finish line since they were all working independently (and no one ever sent me their partial work to hand to the next person that wants to tackle that task).

I'm no DISA ASD STIG expert so I'm not sure where to start, but if you want to spearhead it Mike, I'd be glad to help out in any way I can (and try to dig up other volunteers to help out).

And also, if anyone wants to take the lead for any of these other standards (or add a new one to the list), please don't be shy!

 - PCI-DSS
 - ISO 270xx
 - COBIT
 - Various gov't standards

Pravir,

I have CCed John Frisken - you might have met each other during
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AU_Conference_2009

John is the SME on this approach to ISO 27001 ISMS Certification and I
am sure that he would be able to assist.

Several thoughts:

1. There are lots of "security stuff" that should be documented. For example, the existence of misuse/abuse cases, information protection controls on what it takes to release an application into production. On the later, if I use The Hartford as my reference. We had lots of "policies" that internal audit would use to gauge our applications but they would be silly things like "are you using 128-bit SSL" or "password policy". In later years, we did manage to get created a separate "application security policy" that was blessed by Deloitte. While of course I wasn't happy with it and wanted to rewrite it from scratch, at least it speaks to a measurable level of maturity via documentation. While the federal government doesn't throw development work to folks in other time zones, we have to acknowledge that the rest of the world has to rely on documentation in order to get this right.

2. I do believe that we collectively need to reference practices in other maturity models that are complimentary/supportive of ours. Sadly, none of the other SDLC models speak to what exact documentation needs to exist so gaps will exist.

3. Personally, I have mixed feelings about including DoD guidance primarily because they are a demographic who went out and created their own standards. If all the folks in the insurance vertical decided to waste time creating their own standards then would we add a tab for that? A sign of maturity isn't in creating more stuff but sometimes requires all parties to use the same stuff. Would I make a different recommendation for fixing XSS in a DoD app than say a Wall Street app? I am more of a fan of the other slices such as mobile as they benefit all people. Vibing off your "as broad as it could be (i.e. anyone building software)" comment.

Now this is very interesting food for thought, James. Though, it's probably a separate conversation from what Mike is after.

My first question when it comes to documentation maturity is: Does this belong in a framework promoting software security assurance, or is this something covered by other maturity models that are focused on improving sw dev itself. From your points below, I can certainly see some justification for either answer. The tricky part about something like SAMM, tho, is that ideally, *all* the practices in SAMM would just be part of normal dev lifecycle models. But the world's not ideal, so we write down "security stuff" separately from "normal stuff" but the line is fuzzy. 

We tried not to cross the fuzzy line with SAMM 1.0 so that we didn't get into conflicts with any existing dev process models, thus keeping the audience as broad as it could be (i.e. anyone building software). I fear treading into doc maturity too far may overstep this project's "security" flavor, but I'm definitely for tying in activities or language that prevent doc-related vulnerabilities or compromised specs. Just not sure how we'd reasonably tell people to prevent those things :)

Just my $0.02.

We should noodle the implications of documentation handed to developers by business analysts before software is written and documentation that is turned over to operations folks by developers. The former could lead to business logic flaws while the later could lead to mis-configuration. At the process level, can a team skip producing documentation because they are jammed and still be considered mature according to SAMM?

Hi,

I'm trying to apply SAMM in 2 large company (energy, insurance), things
become much complex than expected; below some issues I'm now facing.

   1. "discontinuous" level: for example, the company is reaching level 2 on
   Policy & compliance, but nothing at level 1... how to represent maturity
   level?

   2. "variable" levels : the company no more develops, nor hosts its
   software; outsourcing and 3rd parties are the rule. But the company still
   owns and manages the risk, IT risk, both technical and business.. how can we
   estimate level with so many stakeholders?

For point 1, discontinuous level, I thought about 2 solutions

   - Introducing "minus" levels: 1- 2- 3-
   1+ 2+ 3+ describe "up-achievement" of the levels, while 1- 2- 3- describe
   "down-achievement"
   - Using "vector" of 3 level-points : 0 1 0 <=> level 1 ko, level 2 ok,
   level 3 ok
   (in this case 1+ 2+ 3+ are not necessary); further we can imagine a % for
   each point, leading us to represent the maturity level in a radar diagram.

Obviously, this complexifies the representation, but it seems to be more
realistic.

Experience feedback would be appreciated.

Thank you,
 MAB

Hi,

 

I'm trying to apply SAMM in 2 large company (energy, insurance), things
become much complex than expected; below some issues I'm now facing.

1.	"discontinuous" level: for example, the company is reaching
level 2 on Policy & compliance, but nothing at level 1... how to
represent maturity level? This is normal in most large organizations. If
you are using SAMM at the "enterprise" level, I think the question is
more about 80% does and not the outliers. Otherwise, you could take SAMM
and produce on a division by division basis.
2.	"variable" levels : the company no more develops, nor hosts its
software; outsourcing and 3rd parties are the rule. But the company
still owns and manages the risk, IT risk, both technical and business..
how can we estimate level with so many stakeholders? A company does not
have to develop software in order to align. What they may need to do is
to ensure that their partners are doing it on their behalf. If you were
to look at their outsourcing agreement in the software development
space, is any form of security lifecycle mandated in contract? Have the
outsourcing firms trained their staff in secure coding practices, etc?

For point 1, discontinuous level, I thought about 2 solutions

*	Introducing "minus" levels: 1- 2- 3-
	1+ 2+ 3+ describe "up-achievement" of the levels, while 1- 2- 3-

Message-ID: <AANLkTineVTzY2niHnq=3mDGLbOCpRAw8=Y4HC5Mi64DG@mail.gmail.com>

Pravir,

To follow on from the recent blog comment to
http://www.opensamm.org/2009/03/whats-up-with-the-other-model/

>From my reading of the Domains and Practices (excluding Activities) of
the Software Security Framework specified by BSIMM1/2 I have concluded
that the following correlation may (i.e. this could be incorrect)
exist with OpenSAMM v1.0 (excluding Objectives):

Within the ?Governance? Domain of BSIMM:
- The ?Compliance and Policy? Practice of BSIMM is listed in reverse
within OpenSAMM i.e. ?Policy and Compliance? Security Practice and;
- The ?Training? Practice of BSIMM is listed as the ?Education and
Guidance? Security Practice of OpenSAMM.

The "Intelligence" Domain of BSIMM is the "Construction" Business
Function of OpenSAMM:
- The ?Attack Models? Practice within BSIMM is ?Threat Assessment?
Security Practice of OpenSAMM and;
- ?Security Features and Design? Practice within BSIMM is ?Security
Requirements? Security Practice of OpenSAMM and;
- ?Standards and Requirements? Practice within BSIMM  is ?Secure
Architecture? Security Practice of OpenSAMM.

The ?SSDL Touchpoints? Domain of BSIMM is the ?Verification? Business
Function of OpenSAMM:
- The ?Architecture Analysis? Practice of BSIMM is ?Design Review?
Security Practice of OpenSAMM.

Within the "Deployment" Domain of BSIMM:
- The ?Penetration Testing? Practice of BSIMM is ?Vulnerability
Management? Security Practice of OpenSAMM and;
- The ?Software Environment? Practice of BSIMM is ?Environment
Hardening? Security Practice of OpenSAMM and;
- The ?Configuration Management and Vulnerability Management? Practice
of BSIMM is addressed in part by ?Operational Enablement? Security
Practice of OpenSAMM


While I intent to present the possible correlation with Activities of
BSIMM to the Objectives of OpenSAMM shortly I believe that correlation
at the (BSIMM) Domain/ (OpenSAMM) Business Function and (BSIMM)
Practice/(OpenSAMM) Security Practice first will align and correct any
possible errors above.

Furthermore, I am intending to remain impartial to both OpenSAMM and
BSIMM hence the use of my @cmlh.id.au e-mail address rather then my
@owasp.org e-mail address.

I welcome any constructive feedback from the community.

Dear James,
Thank you.
The 80/20 rule you told will certainly fulfill the needs.
About partners, actually most of them shall not proceed to SAMM's activities
to deliver on time/on budget.
First time we talked about penalties for security flaws, we gave in the SLA
assurance level required on ASVS basis, or compliance required with the
Top10. And this seems to make sense for everyone.
Taking the issue by compliance seems to be more effective, as long as
software security still appear counterproductive.
But I will come back later to share some feedback about SAMM.
Thank you again.
MAB

We as a profession believe it is cheaper to "build it in" rather than
test it out, however reality is much different. The "test it out" crowd
has penetration testing which you can put in the hands of anyone and
perform point-and-shoot. Likewise, the after it is built "audit" crowd
loves their checklist. Maturity in the build-it-in requires actual
competencies and is a lot less repeatable...

Dear James,

Thank you.

The 80/20 rule you told will certainly fulfill the needs.

About partners, actually most of them shall not proceed to SAMM's
activities to deliver on time/on budget.

First time we talked about penalties for security flaws, we gave in the
SLA assurance level required on ASVS basis, or compliance required with
the Top10. And this seems to make sense for everyone.

Taking the issue by compliance seems to be more effective, as long as
software security still appear counterproductive.

But I will come back later to share some feedback about SAMM.

Thank you again.

MAB

i agree 100%; "test it out" is both a business and a nonsense for all... but
management.
Sure it is highly repeatable; and further, i'm pretty sure that there is
more business to do with "build in" than with "test out"; but, for
convincing stakeholders or top management, testing output is much more
handleable.
i saw many IT projects chose keeping applications at risk, while conducting
assessments for leveraging budget the next year, by showing off inherent
risk to managers, risk and business owners.
Learning curve seems mandatory, and we need base figures, and that's what i
really miss actually..
Likewise, ROI calculators have been given last week by IBM or HP for their
"test out" products, but do we have kind of ROI for "built in"
tools/methodologies?
For instance, very few companies implement security from design phase;
likewise, solution providers miss it too: Microsoft's Threat Modeling tool
seems alone in these earlier phases?
basically, i find SAMM powerful for planning or proving.
It seems to me that the main purpose today is to prove;
Appsec therefore seems, from my point of view, much more often driven by
"verification", than by "construction" activities..?
