Subject: [SAMM] Translation: Portuguese
Message-ID: <BAY150-W65524BBBA1116ABD5F019BB4C20@phx.gbl>


Hello,
 First I would like to say that I appreciate all the work/dedication to build this great methodology. I would like to help it by translating it to portuguese. Is someone already working on that ?
 It's my understanding that I can start doing it by working on the .xml file...is this correct ?
 
Thank you in advance,
Renato Lima

Hello Renato,

Some friends and I are already translating it to Portuguese. It's almost
done, I think. I finished the first 1/3 of it. I'm just waiting for them to
finish their part of the XML file. If you still would like to help you can
do a review of my translation, just for spell check and accuracy. How about
that? Let me know what you think.

Regards,

This sounds great to me. Let me know when you have the XML translated and I can generate the graphical PDF version.

Thanks!

Ok Pravir, will do! I'm planning to finish the translation by the end of
the year. I'll let you know.

Thanks!
