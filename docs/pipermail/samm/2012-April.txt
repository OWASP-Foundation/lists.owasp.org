Hey Joe.

As Colin & Christian mentioned, BSIMM is a periodically updates survey that captures what companies say they're doing about software security. My general rule of thumb was to use OpenSAMM for organizations that were fairly immature and/or jut getting started with software security. For organizations that were more sophisticated (say maybe a year or two in to a software security program), BSIMM provided some rough data to measure the organization against. 

For a while I was really tempted to try to produce similar types of BSIMM stats against SAMM, but I stopped since I consider it harmful after seeing a few pathological organizations that are striving to hit BSIMM averages (because of know-nothing execs blindly chasing metrics) as opposed to practicing good risk management and making intelligent trade-off decisions that are relevant to the specifics of their organization. SAMM clearly sides with the latter group... You know your org, you make the calls.

I'll just leave this thought here though -

I use SAMM often to bench-mark an org; and what would really be useful to
me is if we could turn it into a tool; that people could use to self-audit
and for the 'stats' to update in real time. In this way the document would
be living; but also it could contain historical measurements as well;
allowing one to see their progress or impact over-time; and also measure
trajectory toward their goals. I imagine a kind of web-app for this - but
do not know what it would look like. Is anybody else interested in such a
tool?

Privar,

I don't consider this a fair comment about BSIMM since their statement
related to how the data is collected, correlated and presented in
their "Introduction -> Method" section i.e. p2 of BSIMM3 (i.e. p7 of
61 pages of their PDF).  BSIMM is also closely aligned with OpenSAMM
since it was based on your beta release.

Furthermore, I will draw your attention to
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2011-July/000291.html and
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2011-July/000294.html in
relation to OpenSAMM efforts to replicate BSIMM.

While an executive can have an ulterior motive due to an immature
culture i.e. https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2009-July/001785.html
in a highly mature organisation their KPI is still measured on how
they performed against their peers.

That stated, the part time resource metrics in OpenSAMM can form the
basis for what would be transitioned to the Software Security Group
(SSG) as full time resources.

Maybe Dennis meant a tool to track, log and report on all the activities, including documents, metrics and audit data, which are then used to create the final scores and roadmaps. And maintain this evidence over time?

It might also be possible to do some practices on a per team / per application basis and then aggregate the results.

I use SAMM often to bench-mark an org; and what would really be useful to me is if we could turn it into a tool; that people could use to self-audit and for the 'stats' to update in real time. In this way the document would be living; but also it could contain historical measurements as well; allowing one to see their progress or impact over-time; and also measure trajectory toward their goals. I imagine a kind of web-app for this - but do not know what it would look like. Is anybody else interested in such a tool?

As luck would have it ? we have created a web app called ThreadFix that does just this. And it is available free under a Mozilla license. Currently in open beta.

Check out:
https://code.google.com/p/threadfix/

The app lets you divide your organization into teams and (among other things) evaluate those teams for SAMM maturity based on the excellent interview spreadsheets put together by Nick Coblentz:
http://nickcoblentz.blogspot.com/2009/06/samm-inteview-template-version-10.html

One thing I will say is that this capability in the app has probably received less testing than some of the other, potentially sexier functionality. However if folks are interested in an OpenSAMM app I can probably get some more engineering resources on it. Folks can submit bugs/feature requests here:
https://code.google.com/p/threadfix/issues/list

I?ll see if we can get a wiki page up with a tutorial on the OpenSAMM functionality in the next day or so and post that up to the list for folks who want to try it out. Love to hear any feedback!

Thanks,

Dan

Colin,

The web app could be simplified with a wiki with a link to artifacts
common to all teams and their associated applications.

That stated, the requirements specification should be based on a
checklist of these artifacts which OpenSAMM and BSIMM do not currently
list in a single reference.

The ROI of the web app would be justifiable once the checklist is available.

Yeah Colin is spot on here, but then he had the context of having had the
benefit of speaking directly with me about the idea as I discussed my
frustration with the current process I had utilizing it in my current
context.

Now THIS would be awesome. If such a tool could anonymize and accumulate data at project-level granularity with associated project meta-data (perhaps risk-ratings or other architectural characteristics), we'd have a *really* useful dataset.

This would address the main reason I think the BSIMM (or if we did them for SAMM) style of stats at the organizational level *can* be harmful. Let me explain. It is an utterly meaningless statement for any organization with a medium to large development staff to say 'We do X.' Take pentesting. <org name> does pen-testing? Really? What projects? 100% of them? 0.01% of them? Now what about frequency... Continuously daily? Every year? Every decade? All I'm saying is that the difference between great and miserable assurance programs all live in that grey area. Further, while I haven't looked at the latest BSIMM, the earlier versions all stated they used the 'high water mark' for scoring a practice. So if you find zero level 1 activities, zero level 2, and a single level 3, then the org gets a 3 score for the whole practice. This further whitewashes over any meaning from the underlying data, but that's a BSIMM problem and not a general problem with measurement at the org level, so I digress.

But project-level granularity of data solves this abstraction problem. Of course for some practices you may want to still measure at the org level instead of project (e.g. policy), but any practice could vary at the project level. I've recommended to almost every organization that they 'slice' their apps/projects on some factor(s). My favorite was 'risk buckets', for instance high/med/low. If a project is in the high category, they have a particular SAMM vector they're expected to meet. For medium, we lower the expected levels. And for low, sometimes we just leave it unspecified or very lightweight (a few level 1's). Instead of slicing on risk buckets, sometimes we've used line-of-business boundaries. Sometimes both. Sometimes other factors (inhouse/outsourced, lots of others potentially). 

So don't get me wrong, I'm all for data collection and stats, I'm just weighing in my opinion on the 'right' way to do the measurement. It would be kick-ass if we could say something like: "compared to apps tagged 'internet-facing' and 'financial-services' and 'high-risk', YOUR app score is in the 80th percentile". And if those could be continuously updated from aggregated and anonymized stats? THAT would be killer.

But this is the whole point of the tool - to collect data, to do what 
follows all requires we have that data? I imagine something where the 
questions are all tied back to a set o practices, which are all tied 
back to a set of activities that produce artefacts. So in a ideal world 
you can have a 'real-time' SAMM assessment, and your score-card becomes 
a dynamic consolidation of the artefacts. This makes it possible to say 
take GIT snapshots of that activity (perhaps daily?) and have a whole 
new host of data that we currently don't have. SAMM is wicked cool, lets 
take it to the next level of cool!

This is roughly what I imagine, assume you had an ISO 27000 audit and 
instead of that being a giant hair-pulling process that takes a year to 
complete it was a matter of sitting down to a web application and asking 
for a report of compliance with evidence and it dynamically generated it 
from a database? (I know, I know - stay with me though...)

Scale that down to SAMM and you have a good idea about what I am 
thinking.

Take for example Under Governance we have Education:
What do we do to educate? How often? Lets say we every quarter we run a 
security awareness campaign that campaign is one of the education 
practices; and lets just further say that this quarter we educated our 
developers on the OWASP top 10.

<tangent>
Now, this is important - we should point back to our own OWASP projects 
as much as possible as suggested practices where possible.
</tangent>

Now the evidence could be that we quizzed all the developers on that 
material and their quizzes, or perhaps their signatures of attendance 
become the evidence of attendance. This evidence now 'moves' the needle 
of maturity in our SAMM rating for Education.

SAMM constitutes a kind of a policy, which needs supporting practices, 
all of which require actives, all of which generate evidence. And right 
now I am not able to capture any of that incredibly rich data?

Imagine further that this is (see turnkey linux) a VM, or an ISO, or XEN 
or EC2 deployable tool; and literally anybody is up and running SAMM!

That would be wicked - ISMS in a box?

This low level of granularity might not be of interest to an executive
i.e. the intended audience.

It could be of value to others (e.g. middle management) provided the
issue with the frequency metric could be overcome e.g. fuzzing is
conducted as part of continuous integration and if it fails then what
is the effect on the measurement of future builds (e.g. the next build
of continuous integration) if the initial crash is still outstanding?
The answer would be subjective.

BSIMM reflects that some companies are conducting specific advanced
activities without consideration of the activities at a lower maturity
level and this is explored within their "Ranking BSIMM3 Activities".
Furthermore, BSIMM does not reference
http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/solutions/dev/index.cfm and this inferred
within http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1562220

Therefore, this issue, in the context of CMMI, is directly related to
OpenSAMM (which BSIMM is based on the beta release) since it does not
reflect real world implementation.

This will result in every application development manager accepting
the lower residual risk to ensure that their application ships without
any security controls so that they get their bonus i.e. this is
similar to the executive ulterior motive explored in the prior
message.

You might want to read ISO 27003 as the ISMS has greater consideration
of maturity rather than trying to achieve ~60 security controls all at
once which is why it failed since it was considered a printing money
exercise for SAI Global, BSI, etc due to these initial bad
experiences.

I have written a process partially based 27034 for Aon EMEA and I
believe it's useful template for a mature, auditable process. Security
requirements are mostly based on ASVS. Currently I'm working on a
model that would allow more rational allocation of resources for
security testing, outlined here:

Ok, you've sold me on the value and this sounds like the right way to go. Also sounds like we're mostly in agreement on the general idea, so that's a plus. What do we need to do to get this rolling?

Dan, I haven't looked at ThreadFix In a while, but would the kind of features Dennis discusses below be of interest? I'll try to get a test instance stood up somewhere (unless there's a public demo) and can make accounts and whatnot for those interested in giving it a test.

I imagine something where the questions are all tied back to a set o practices, which are all tied back to a set of activities that produce artefacts. So in a ideal world you can have a 'real-time' SAMM assessment, and your score-card becomes a dynamic consolidation of the artefacts. This makes it possible to say take GIT snapshots of that activity (perhaps daily?) and have a whole new host of data that we currently don't have. SAMM is wicked cool, lets take it to the next level of cool!

It is an utterly meaningless statement for any organization with a medium to large development staff to say 'We do X.' Take pentesting. <org name> does pen-testing? Really?

It would be kick-ass if we could say something like: "compared to apps tagged 'internet-facing' and 'financial-services' and 'high-risk', YOUR app score is in the 80th percentile". And if those could be continuously updated from aggregated and anonymized stats? THAT would be killer.

I'm not sure I followed that entirely, but you're muddling the issues of what's the right granularity of *collection* of data vs *presentation* of data. Most of my comments concern the former as this is, in my opinion, far more fundamentally important since if you have garbage data, no degree of presentation magic makes it useful.

I am in agreement completely on the presentation of (specific) data which
we should define as its "view" as each audience is not presented with the
entire dataset e.g. "Executive view", "Application Development Manager
view", "Developer view", "Application Security view", etc

For processes that are purely technical, such as the fuzzing example I used
below, we need to specify how they can be measured objectivity and
not subjectivity (at least not without a disclaimer of the subjective
measurement and how that may skew the objective measure).

Let me know when you arrive in Australia this week since you are presenting
on Friday 13 April and we can discuss?  We could also close some of

I went through the model very quickly and I'm wondering why you chose 50% for the vulnerability likelihood? In coin-flip prediction calcs this would make sense, but in your model it's not used as such (if I'm understanding it correctly). It seems like a pretty fundamental constant that directly derives cost tolerances and such, meaning that if you changed it to ~100% (a far more likely figure based on my experience with security testing), wouldn't all of the cost projections pretty much default to the max value of potential loss? Like I said, I may have misunderstood, but just some thoughts? Interesting ideas overall.

Actually this is a great presentation - and I would love to discuss it
more; I tried to download your models - but they don't work on linux or mac.

I always assume 100% compromise. This is because *zero* day exploits are
for sale, and attackers have them. You can not defend against the future
nor uncertainty. Thus the question isn't "if you get hacked", its "when you
get hacked" can you detect it and how do you manage it.

Pravir, Dennis,

 

That?s a good point. 50% is initial value, assuming zero knowledge about an application and reflecting ?full? uncertainty about its vulnerability status. The whole point is that you then apply the whole battery of tests against the application to see what is its real vulnerability status.

 

Also note that I?ve defined vulnerability as something that directly leads to a compromise, or more precisely one of three outcomes leading to loss (data breach, opportunistic hack, client attacks). With this assumption I wasn?t really able to confirm many industry reports that claimed that 70% applications on Internet are vulnerable. 

 

Of course, if you run a scanner against virtually any website you?ll get a number of ?medium? and ?high? rated ?issues?, but if I was asking myself ?can I hack this application right away? in most cases the answer was be ?no?.

Sorry for the delayed response. Those features are certainly interesting,
although we might need to branch the code and get them into a 1.1 release
as we're trying to lock things down for our actual 1.0.

The most recent version (currently beta10) can be found online here:
http://code.google.com/p/threadfix/downloads/list


Also we do already have a couple of OpenSAMM issues in the issue tracker
here:

SAMMers

The cheat sheet series seems to be moving along at a rapid pace:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cheat_Sheets

There's a discussion over on the GPC list about creating some printed
copies (as a tabbed book) for handouts fairly soon, so I wondered if
we should be producing a "Secure SDLC cheat sheet"?  I think that
could be relatively simple to put together, as we could use the 12
security practice headings, and perhaps list the text we have in the
various assessment worksheets in each for "level 1"?

Okay, thanks for the thumbs up.  I have now created a stub page at:

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_SDLC_Cheat_Sheet

and typed in some text from the assessment worksheet. I'll add the
other references shortly.  Could others now add/expand the text?

Yes, we ought to talk about development methodology somewhere on the page.
