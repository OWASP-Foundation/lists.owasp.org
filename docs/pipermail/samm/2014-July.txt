All,

Please find below the request from Johanna.

I would appreciate you take 1 minute of your time and vote "Software
Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)" back as flagship project!

OpenSAMM is one of the most mature OWASP document projects and we have an
active community around it.

Here is the link:

Thank you very much,

Kind regards,

Seba

Subject: [SAMM] OWASP SAMM training material,
	next steps and 1 minute of your time!
Message-ID: <CAAihoGv6LCKigg80L7-c7rJfcigkjJYkTk3Owh4UKFo6=Kp-hg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

A couple of weeks ago Bart De Win and myself delivered a well-received
OWASP SAMM 1-Day training at AppSec Europe 2014 in Cambridge:
Slide deck download:
https://www.owasp.org/images/d/df/OpenSAMM_Training_vFINAL.pptx
Training description download:
https://www.owasp.org/images/7/7c/Training_-_Bootstrap_and_improve_your_SDLC_with_OpenSAMM.docx

We had 6 attendees with very good feedback on the training.
We encourage you to reuse the material and hope you contribute back any
improvements you might have.

Furthermore Bart and I have donated our cut of the training profit (1500
EUR) to the OWASP SAMM project. These funds are most welcome to improve
SAMM to version 1.1 and organize a dedicated SAMM summit (planned for Q1
2015, detailed timing and venue to be announced).

Lastly, if you like or use SAMM: please vote it back to Flagship status by
filling in the following form:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&formkey=dHBMYjdpZzVXaFJjTWgwVzdOdTJCbEE6MA
(Vote for Flagship - OWASP Document Projects)

This will take you less than 1 minute!

Thank you very much,

Kind regards

Seba
co-leader OWASP SAMM project
