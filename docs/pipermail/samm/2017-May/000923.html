Hi Summit Participant. As you can see by the Summit Schedule
&lt;<A HREF="http://owaspsummit.org/schedule/summit-schedule.html">http://owaspsummit.org/schedule/summit-schedule.html</A>&gt;, one of the nice
problems that Participants will have is going to be: *how to select which
Working Sessions to attend*.

The Summit will create a highly focused and energized environment where
each Participant is donating it most valuable assets: *Time and Knowledge*

The Working Sessions organizers have the privilege of the Participant&#8217;s
time, which is a massive gift. Their responsibility is to create the most
effective and productive environments for them.

In practice this means that we need to be very disciplined on what will
happen in the Working Sessions, where we need to ensure that each one will
create something tangible and actionable.

Working Sessions are competing for Participant&#8217;s talent and time (in a
darwinian way). Working Session organizers need to create detailed action
plans and to-dos lists, that are easy pick up and start contributing
(recommendation is to use GitHub Issues and Projects)

In the next couple weeks we need *each Working Session to explicitly define
what is its &#8216;Definition of Done&#8217;* (which will affect the location and
duration of that Working Session in the main Summit&#8217;s schedule).

Here are some examples of what these outcomes/deliverables could look like:

   - Artifacts (Diagrams)
   - Documents or Books
   - Playbooks
   - Roadmaps (for next meeting)
   - Wiki pages (namely on owasp.org)
   - Code
   - Statement or Position (signed by the Working Sessions Participants)
   - Security Review (or a particular application or api)
   - Lessons Learned

All materials must be ready by end of the day (or Working Session), so that
we can release them to the world in a consumable format (there will be some
logistical support provided to Working Sessions organizers). For reference
all materials need to be released under an CC BY 4.0
&lt;<A HREF="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</A>&gt; or Apache 2.0
&lt;<A HREF="https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html</A>&gt; licenses.

If you are an Working Session organizer, please *start mapping what is the
&#8216;Definition of Done&#8217; for your Working Session* (if you are not an
organizer, but have ideas of what should happen at a particular Working
Session, then become an organizer, and make your ideas real).

We will be adding a *&#8216;Definition of Done&#8217;* to all Working Sessions. *A**ny
Working Session that doesn&#8217;t have one, will NOT be added to the main
schedule* and benefit from being part of the Summit Participant&#8217;s
individual daily schedule.

It will be better to have a smaller number of Working Sessions highly
focused on a common objective (for 1,3,6,9 hours) than to have large number
of Working Sessions made of only *&#8216;great conversations and debates&#8217;* (which
btw will still happen due to the Summit&#8217;s 18h per day collaboration
environment)

Given the time restrictions of the talent pool available (couple days in
June), the best way to achieve solid results at the Summit, is to work on
the Working Sessions topics *before the Summit*. This means *NOW*!

Please don&#8217;t wait for the Summit to start thinking/sharing/working on the
Working Sessions you want to be involved in.

Start collaborating now with the Participants already registered, and leave
the hard questions or work for the Summit.

We have a great opportunity to really make the difference in our industry
and (more importantly) to make the world a bit safer.

This is your time to create something special

Thanks again for giving Owasp and the Security community your most valuable
asset: Time and Knowledge
