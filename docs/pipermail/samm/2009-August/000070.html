<PRE>Hey Everyone.
Over the course of the last several months, I've worked with a number of
organizations to help them set up software security initiatives based on
SAMM, and it's been working pretty well. For some upcoming conferences (I'm
thinking end of 2009, early 2010), I wanted to put together a conference
talk about &quot;SAMM in Action&quot; and discuss some real-world use-cases and
experiences on what worked and what didn't work.

I'll definitely credit any people/organizations that don't want to remain
anonymous and I'm open to co-presenting. Also, ideas on good conferences to
target are also welcome.

Thanks!

p.

PS: in case you didn't see, Neil MacDonald from Gartner had a short blog
post about us... I posted about it on the OpenSAMM site.
