Dear all,

due to the recent release of SAMM v1.5 (which still has to be announced -
working on that), we did not have time to properly prepare today's meeting.
Therefor, the meeting will be rescheduled somewhere in the coming weeks.

Stay tuned for the new date to be announced !

Best,
Bart.

hi,

With the release of OWASP SAMM v1.5 I wanted to update you on the project
leadership.

Both Pravir and Kuai decided to step down as project co-leaders. We thank
them for their contributions and involvement in the earlier versions!

Brian Glas has joined as SAMM project co-leader, based on his continuous
contributions and activities for the SAMM project (and v1.5 specifically).
Welcome Brain!

The 3 project co-leaders are now: Bart De Win, Brian Glas and myself.

PS: I have not been very active on the SAMM project, as I currently spend
my ?OWASP cycles? on co-organizing the upcoming owaspsummit.org (which
includes SAMM workshops, stay tuned for a separate email).


Kind regards,

Seba

Brian spoke to both the OWASP DC and OWASP NoVA chapters this week about
the new (and future) versions of SAMM, and everyone was pretty impressed.
My current client is excited to do another assessment with 1.5, just a few
months after doing so with a previous version.

Thank you, Pravir and Kuai, for your efforts, and we are looking forward to
the work of Seba, Bart, and Brian.

Thank you,
Bryan Batty

hi,

FYI, this aligns very well with our plans to rework SAMM2.0 towards a
secure "DevOps" maturity model.

kind regards

Hello Board members

After talking a couple of times with the OWASP summit organizers, and
seeing the huge interest in companies to implement and improve their DevOps
Security,  I mentioned why not rebrand the summit as

*OWASP DevOps Security Summit: *
*OWASP projects meets DevOpsSec*

The major reason is that for many people OWASP projects are an unknown
thing, For most of the projects, with exception of a few like  ZAP , many
people do not know how to apply these projects or use them in their SDLC or
even better, creating DevOps Security pipeline.

Rebranding it in this way will allow the summit to create more interest and
awareness, as people attending the summit but also for Project leaders to
be able to share their project within these process and show hands on
implementation.

This branding is neutral as this is not a DevOpsCon, but how to apply OWASP
projects in a DevOps process to create continuos delivery.

*Please, could you let us know your opinion on this, as we then can rebrand
the summit and market it in a way that is also appealing to folks looking
on how to put DevOps in practice?*

The concept consist in having tracks and Villas that actually match the
DevOps security process/pipelines where projects leaders attending are set
together like the following:

DevSecOps Pipeline:



*PLAN: *

OWASP TOP TEN/MOBILE

OWASP SAMM

OWASP ASVS

OWASP Js Juice

OWASP Web Goat



*CODE:*

Code Review

ASVS

SAMM...

OWASP O2

OWASP Proactive Controls



*TEST:*

OWASP Mobile testing guide

OWASP testing Guide

OWASP ZAP



*BUILD:*

OWASP Secure Application Design project

OWASP SKF


Thank you for your time and consideration


Regards
