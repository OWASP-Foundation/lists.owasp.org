Hi Team!

Anyone interested in kickstarting some live into this project again? I know Pravir has mentioned having plans on making updates to OpenSAMM. However, I wanted to send a 'ping' out there perhaps, setup a conf call with those interested in contributing and injecting some life into this project which I consider one of the most important projects in our industry and the OWASP community.  I have had separate conversations with members of the OWASP and the software security community, some with great ideas and I think it is time to take some action. I would certainly be happy to take the lead, help coordinate relevant initiatives. Thoughts?

Hi Team!

Anyone interested in kickstarting some live into this project again? I
know Pravir has mentioned having plans on making updates to OpenSAMM.
However, I wanted to send a 'ping' out there perhaps, setup a conf call
with those interested in contributing and injecting some life into this
project which I consider one of the most important projects in our
industry and the OWASP community.  I have had separate conversations
with members of the OWASP and the software security community, some with
great ideas and I think it is time to take some action. I would
certainly be happy to take the lead, help coordinate relevant
initiatives. Thoughts?

Reporting in to me too thread.

I've found OpenSAMM to be my go to SDL maturity model refreshingly free of
product and dogma attachment. I'm happy to do what I can to assist the
project.

Will there be a location for us to gather out thoughts and efforts
collaboratively, or is this more of a grab stuff and circle back to the
mailing list style thing?

It would definitely be interesting to see some further development going
on. I do not know in how far we can contribute though but I will try my
best.

I too have interest, and I often use SAMM in my professional life.
However, I have limited bandwidth to contribute at this time.

Same with Dennis here. I'd like to be kept in the loop and contribute as
much as I can (it won't be a lot though).

Classification: UNCLASSIFIED
Caveats: NONE

All,

	I'm working to convince my organization to implement SAMM or BSIMM4,
but to do so within our current implementation of CMMI.  Does anyone have
insight on whether doing so within the CMMI framework will work or not work?

	We have about 50 separate software development projects at any given
time in my organization, all doing their own software assurance thing, but
subject to strict testing prior to release.  We know we need to plan in the
security from the start. 

	Also, are there consultants who have experience guiding
organizations in implementing SAMM?

James,

As far as I am aware there is no mapping document published for
http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/solutions/dev/ aside from the fact that
both OpenSAMM and BSIMM were loosely based on CMMI.

I have published some guidance on implementing both BSIMM and OpenSAMM
in parallel which is available from
http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/bsammbo

I would also recommend that you also consider both "Putting BSIMM4 to
Use" and "Ranking BSIMM4 Activities" as a comparison to your market
vertical.

Would any of you be able to:

1. Help finish the draft S-SDLC cheat sheet
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_SDLC_Cheat_Sheet

2. Write and publish "Implementing SAMM" case studies

3. Blog about SAMM

I created a stub for 1 and try to do 3 now and again.

I would be happy to help out with the Secure SDLC cheat sheet.  I should
have quite a bit of time next month to dedicate to it.

That would be great. I think it should be kept relatively short, but
reflect what SAMM says. Maybe we need to think more about early
adopters and those using Agile processes to tease them into the
concept.

See this (read all the comments):
https://securosis.com/blog/bsimm-and-joe-the-programmer

If you *must* map to BSIMM then use this:
http://www.opensamm.org/2011/03/bsimm-activities-mapped-to-samm/

But always remember what my mother said;
"Just because everybody is jumping off a cliff doesn't make it a good idea"

BSIMM is based on OpenSAMM (Beta) and as expected the implementation
of any high level maturity process requires a large number of
developers and are not applicable to a one (wo)man shops.

Of note is that BSIMM found that several process that are at the upper
maturity levels (of OpenSAMM) were implemented but not the processes
at the lower levels.

Gary expands on this anomaly of OpenSAMM within

This is not an independent comparison as both Pravir and Brian are
both employees of Fortify and Brian is also one of three main authors
of BSIMM.

http://cmlh.id.au/tagged/opensamm is considered independent has
published for review and comment to Sammy, Gary and Brian (from BSIMM)
and on this (samm at lists.owasp.org) mailing list.

On that note, I would be also interested in considering the work from
Bart De Win which I refer to in the comments to
http://www.opensamm.org/2011/03/bsimm-activities-mapped-to-samm/

With all due respect Christian,

Gary has said: "I hold this truth to be self evident - security is an
emergent property of the entire system, just like
quality."<https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:4lYjcfmzcYIJ:www.cigital.com/presentations/bsimm10_McGraw.pdf+&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESibvC0Rx1ThseSaJ6diAP8J2u2lACHi2yYdzpe7RKmhlfxpKZL2Bhy0qH2UqA6KujDSM8iVYjVB-6oOBxjUeIRfFFL5LxWVOa2uKV_ONgVcfOTe94xvCJSHqxO5unk2Xlajt1WE&sig=AHIEtbQsIFe5AQm6GyHuXw6pQk0AIerYXw>

I hate to controdict; however, the primary assumption is that security
exists!
Security does not exist! Security is no more an emergent property than a
pot of gold at the end of a rainbow!

Humans for example are fantasticly complex systems with a number of systems
dedicated to their security. However, numerous pathogens still compromise
the system - for example viri like aids; to name a single example.
Survivability aka homeostasis in a hostile envoirnment is the **very best**
we can aim for.

Security is a unicorn, it is completely imaginary.

You should know this more than anybody Christian, since nobody can keep you
out of anything if you put your mind to it. Why? Because their is only one
way to be secure and that is control of the entire chain of trust; which is
impossible, and there are gazillions of was to be insecure. Second, even if
somebody did manage to be secure at some moment in time, the laws of
entropy would decay the trust/securue and it would returen to insecurity.

Again, I maintain *security* is as imaginary as
Equestria<http://www.equestriadaily.com/>.

Dennis,

I am not sure where you are coming from but
http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/are the best approach to implement a level
of security within an immature
organisation.

The "all or nothing" approach of PCI DSS, etc doesn't work as it will
ultimately be rejected politically due to the lack of maturity within an
organisation which is the primary reason behind ISO/IEC 27003:2010
being a CMMI implementation of an ISMS.
