Subject: [SAMM] updated SAMM project page
Message-ID: <CAAihoGvVQzUWx6NPZyrkAg1WVfwBakSMsoourfB_1RbZY621uw@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

Happy New Year!

I took a stab at updating the SAMM project page into the latest OWASP
project template.

Have a look at the result here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project

It will replace the current page
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model
which is actually a wiki category page.

any feedback or suggestion to add tabs and/or content are most welcome!

Kind regards

Seba

Seba,
The release candidate is looking great!
I looked through the documents and found that everything that I noticed had
already been noted in the spreadsheet.
I'll take a look at the two notes about the toolbox spreadsheet and fix if
needed.
Unfortunately I won't be able to make the call on Thursday, am at BlueHat
all week.

Thanks,
Brian

hi,

short update on the call we just had:
We had some great participation and covered 121 (!) remarks on the RC1
document set.

Thanks to all the reviewers who did a marvelous job.
We will now implement according to the discussed course of action for each
comment.
This will result in a Release Candidate 2 version, where we plan a
short-cycle review on new paragraphs and QA the implementation.

The meeting minutes are available online here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hCQRst1sUaXMmstTDJUzx-EPWtbkw7m4sE0GqbIBwJM/edit
