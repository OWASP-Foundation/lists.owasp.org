Subject: [SAMM] SAMM workshop next week in Hamburg
Message-ID: <CAAihoGv90BB9WJdA=3f6W3_d7vwbXNFJ8f7fU0y11dC8fh9XYg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

During the AppSec conferences, the SAMM project team organises workshops
for you to influence the direction SAMM evolves.
This is also an excellent opportunity to exchange experiences with your
peers.

Next week Wednesday we organise our first OpenSAMM workshop at AppSec.eu in
Hamburg.

The agenda:

   1. Introduction / getting to know each other - 10 mins.
   2. Project status and goals - 10 mins.
   3. OpenSAMM inventory of tools and templates - 20 mins
   4. Case studies / sharing experiences - 40 mins.
   5. What do we need (thinking about improvements, can be anything ranging
   from translations over tools to model improvements) - 40 mins
   6. What do we need first (prioritization) - 30 mins.
   7. Call for involvement (responsibilities), identity teams for specific
   topics - 15 mins
   8. Rough planning for the future - 15 mins

Location: Alster room in the Scandic
Hotel<http://www.scandichotels.com/hamburg#.UgsqsRZSfxl>
Time: Wednesday August 21, 2013 1:00pm - 4:00pm
ICS file attached.

If you plan to come, can you add your name to the online meeting doc
here<https://docs.google.com/document/d/12mB7FkmhcI04YDZle_VD90n1xcENgNhAGqZkCAb6EkM/edit>
?

If you would like to cover other topics, don't hesitate to contact Bart De
Win or myself!

If possible, we will start a gotomeeting call to allow for remote
participation: let us know if you would like to participate remotely?

PS: Similar workshops will be organised in New York (USA) and Lima (Peru)
in the coming months.

See you in Hamburg next week!

Kind regards,

Seba

Hi OWASP Leaders,

The current email is to let you know that I have been invited to
represent OWASP at an ISO/IEC 27034 (Information technology ? Security
techniques ? Application security) meeting by Luc Poulin the main
project editor. It is held this week at Microsoft office in Montreal.

Basically I'm here to contribute to the discussion with practical
application security knowledge and OWASP projects. I'm, of course, just
really speaking "about OWASP" and not "for OWASP".

We are also planning to propose some new OWASP projects, and especially
one that will create Application Security Controls (ASCs) as described
in the standard from OWASP Top 10 entries and other projects.

The ASCs in 27034 are actually made in an XML format and are not only
documentation but a normalized representation of an application security
control, so the mapping is rather different that was done with OpenSAMM
on http://www.opensamm.org/2012/04/mapping-samm-to-isoiec-27034/.

You can find more details about the standard at :
http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27034.html

If anyone is interested on the subject, feel free to reply to this
email. We haven't even started the process to create the new projects
but will welcome any help.

Thanks,

Dear all,

Please find below our OpenSAMM HOST grant application.
Details about HOST are available on
http://investments.opencybersecurity.org/

Regardless of the HOST grant approval, this application provides the
foundation of what we want to achieve with SAMM in the coming years:
<snip>
*

The project consists of a number of complementary activities that will
improve the OpenSAMM model and its global adoption. We explain these
activities in more detail below.

A first set of activities relates to the building of the OpenSAMM community.
For this matter, the project will ensure the creation and distribution of
quarterly OpenSAMM newsletters, as well as the organization of OpenSAMM
workshops at the main OWASP AppSec conferences (USA, Europe, Asia, and
Latin America). At the end of the project, a dedicated OpenSAMM summit will
be organized to wrap up the project and disseminate the project results.

A second set of activities relates to the gathering of empirical data. Two
different approaches will be taken for this milestone. First, we will
create two questionnaires to gather specific data. These questionnaires
will be sent within the OWASP community and beyond, and limited incentives
for completing will be provided. Secondly, we intend to have a project
support resource (student, or a professional in sabbatical mode) do a
number of case studies of organizations to gather such data in a more
proactive manner.

A third set of activities relates to improving the model. Two new versions
of the model will be defined (version 1.1 and version 2.0) in which
specific improvements will be implemented. Furthermore, we will further
work on translating the model into four new languages to facilitate the
adoption in non-native English speaking countries.

>From an education perspective, we will create training material to allow
people to do self-study and/or give presentations on the OpenSAMM model.

To support data gathering and training, an online web application will be
created to enable people to do specific analysis of their situation and to
get advice on where improvements could be implemented with respect to
software assurance in the organization. Such a tool is, to our knowledge,
the first in its kind, and it has the potential of supporting a large
community.

Finally, a last activity relates to standardization of software assurance.
Here, the goal is to work together with standardization bodies such as ISO,
NIST, and potentially others to consider creating a common standard for
software assurance. Likewise, we will consider linking OpenSAMM to
important other standards such as COBIT, ITIL, and so forth.*

*More details in the document and on *
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vz7BLFdt1h5AhmW-Zc2B_KlqhzsSkSAaEASML5U4VQs/edit

Your feedback, and even more your support during the next months and years,
will be used to "mature" SAMM and make a serious dent in insecure software.

I would like to thank the project team and especially Samantha for putting
together a fantastic HOST application!

Kind regards,

Seba

Congratulations.  It is important to engage, but I was wondering how
the issue of "open and free" has been considered. This has held me
back previously from involvement with some third parties "on behalf of
OWASP". For example:

- Will you upload any supporting information to the wiki, or point to
where they are available?
- Will the meeting(s) be available publicly to listen to, or will
there be a recording available for OWASP afterwards?
- Will the standard be free to OWASP (members)?

ISO 27034 Part 1 doesn't mention OWASP at all, at any point or in any reference.

Colin

Hi Colin,

I think your questioning is really pertinent and I'm forwarding this to
owasp-leaders for general information.

See below for my replies.

Please note that it was not really an involvement with OWASP to
contribute directly with an ISO standard.

27034 is somewhat special and defines a "communication protocol" that
uses XML with a Schema in order to propose a structured way to describe
Application Security Controls (ASCs).

The main editor of the standard and me will propose and lead an OWASP
Project that will produce XML with OWASP's content and references. It
will be a way for organizations using 27034 to implement OWASP knowledge
into their security controls.

I do think that this standard is trying to push an "open" way of
exchanging information with the ASCs and of course all OWASP related
stuff will be freely available using that way (XML files).

A wiki project page will be made as soon as I have the time to pass
trough the process of an OWASP project creation (it is my first time). I
expect it to be by the end of August.

Not that I know of. And if I might add, the whole 20+ hours of
discussions where not interesting in my opinion for people not
participating on site. Also, I understood that it was not a real
official ISO meeting so official decisions can comes out of it.

That said, we will document in the wiki page everything that is needed
to understand the project's XML usage and why we are doing this.

Just to be clear again, I was not here to officially represent OWASP but
rather to see if making an OWASP project was a good idea, to learn about
the standard and to bring my knowledge (of OWASP and Application
Security) to the table.

> - Will the standard be free to OWASP (members)?

No. But since the OWASP project will actually produce ASCs, these will
be available for free for any organization that wishes to implement the
ISO standard. I think that the standard, if it's well adopted, will
probably lead to an ecosystem of ASCs and OWASP's ASCs will be a free
option.

That's one of the reason I mentioned that my approach is not really like
SAMM, because I'm really just looking at security control from an 27034
point of view, so the standard itself is not mandatory to even
participate in the project : you just have to understand the XML structure.

I don't think part 1 will ever mention OWASP and will not mention any
other "ASCs providers" since this is not a direct participation in the
standard itself.

The bottom line is that there will be an OWASP project that will deliver
in an open way and for free ASCs in XML format that organizations will
be able to use with 27034. Theses files will not be part of the standard
but will use the schema provided by it.

Seba,

I am concerned that there is not enough to differentiate from
http://www.bsimm.com/ and that OpenSAMM has lost considerable ground
and is now attempting to duplicate BSIMM success.

BSIMM has significant press already i.e. http://www.bsimm.com/press/.
I am not aware of any recent press for OpenSAMM i.e. I can't locate a
single recent example within http://www.opensamm.org/news/

BSIMM has hosted conferences in the past which have positive writeups
by their end users e.g.
http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2012/11/bsimm-community-conference-2012.html,
http://franklinheath.co.uk/2013/04/10/visualising-a-software-security-initiative/

Again, it appears that OpenSAMM are duplicating BSIMM i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2012-April/000350.html

Politically students won't be received well in this role based on
their lack of experience.  Hence why BSIMM surveys are undertaken by
respected appsec authorities i.e. Gary McGraw, Brian Chess, etc

OWASP already provide this i.e.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internationalization#I_want_to_translate_OWASP_Materials_to_.5BPut_your_language_here.5D.2C_Where_should_I_start.3F

As I understand the translators have not been funded, is this not the
case?  If so this may be considered a misleading statement?

As I understand http://www.opensamm.org/download/ (which is of good
quality) was developed without funding?

As OpenSAMM is considered the quality benchmark within OWASP what will
this funding provide above and beyond this benchmark? If OWASP can't
justify this then it appears we are seeking funds via deception (which
is not be the case).

How does the above differ from
http://www.opensamm.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/20120803-samm-scorecard-chart-generation.zip
?

Also, management (who are the intended audiences of maturity models)
prefer a single page "Executive Brief" and a complex web application
might just confuse them with all the browser warnings :)

COBIT, ITIL (the "security" section of ITILv3 is ISO 2700x), etc are
"control" based frameworks and hence their implementation is less
likely to succeed when compared to maturity models such as OpenSAMM
(since control based frameworks have an all or nothing approach which
the organisation might not be mature enough to sustain)

We should have listed "Capability Maturity Model for Software
Development" published by "Carnegie Mellon University" since
integration with other maturity "standards" is easier.

Thank you for your reply.  What raised my concern was the statement

   "have been invited to represent OWASP at an ISO/IEC 27034 ...
meeting by ... the main project editor."

But I think you have clarified this isn't OWASP (as a group)
contributing to that commercial standard, but individuals wishing to
learn more, and possibly on the back of that build information and
resources that would help appsec professionals work with that standard
and others?

On the "not mentioning OWASP", it seemed very odd that in Part 1, so
much space was given over to just one vendor's methodology. But OWASP
itself ought to have a wiki page describing the various standards,
SDLC process models and maturity models, that compares and contrasts
these, and states the pros and cons. All in an unbiased manner.

Good luck with your own project. If you need some help with setting up
wiki pages for the project, I will try to help. I have done a couple
of project pages recently (Codes of Conduct, Cornucopia), but found
inspiration in copying ideas/code from other pages like ZAP.

Don't bother. I'm going to commit the rest once I test that it's complete and rebase to avoid massive git repo clones. Fork at your own risk and recognize that this is merely a binary holding tank, not a real 'source' repo per se (as in the traditional git notion of diff-able text files).

Thank you for your efforts with the new standard.

I do not believe OWASP (as an organisation) can ever contribute
resources and other effort to work that is against the principle of
"free & open". At least that is my understanding.

Presumably this is not as an official OWASP liaison but in his own
professional, or employment, capacity? We all wear multiple "hats".

All,

I strongly agree with Yvan. OWASP NEED to contribute to iso 27034 . Its
part of our mission even the standard is closed.

I will explain you asap(when this is clear for me) how i will contribute(i
have 3 solutions and try the best for this)
