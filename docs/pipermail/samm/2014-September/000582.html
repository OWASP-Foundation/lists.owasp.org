<PRE>I am not attending the conference, but can join the phone calls as needed.

Subject: [SAMM] OpenSAMM Workshop

 

Hi Team!

 

Yan Kravchenko an OpenSAMM participant, asked the project Team if we were going to host an OpenSAMM workshop. Seba and Bart will not attend.  So, I decided to jump in and try to set something up for this upcoming OWASP Summit  

 

We have scheduled a workshop for the 18th and 19th. Please see the schedule for the details - [<A HREF="http://2014.appsecusa.org/2014/about/schedule/">http://2014.appsecusa.org/2014/about/schedule/</A>] 

 

Our goal is to complete the mapping of PCI requirements and SAMM activities. Yan and I started working on this effort earlier this year. We have completed a high level mapping of PCI version 3. Now we are trying to add the details.  

 

In addition, we would like to continue Pravir's suggestion from Hamburg's OpenSAMM workshop, where Pravir suggested to the project team to build cross functional flow charts (play-books), in an effort to provide guidance on how to implement the model. 

 

We would like to use this time to get work done.  Please join us if you are planning to attend the conference.

 

Regards,




Kuai Hinojosa
