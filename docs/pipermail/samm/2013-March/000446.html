<PRE>I will add my 2 cents worth from a personal experience.  I used OpenSAMMto do Software Assurance Program Assessment for a large government agency.   The agency subsequently went on to address the gaps I identified in the program and I had to come up with the processes to incorporate into their SDLC.   The problem is that every government agency and commercial entity alike may differ in how they implement their SDLC as related to security maturity and what they actually do. The agency in question is no exception.   

The processes have to be tailored to each entities specific lifecycle implementation.  Yes, there are some big milestones that everyone has (which may be where we want to focus for OpenSAMM processes), however, its the little rocks that cause the problems during implementation of new processes.  

The solution for me has been to tie the software security program intimately to their compliance program (e.g. FISMA security control compliance) for it to have any teeth.  Government agencies have funding for compliance, but to get it for software assurance it is more difficult because of the cost impacts implementing new processes may have.  I suspect that commercial companys may have the same problems as compliance works its way into that arena (e.g. FedRAMP etc..)

The net is that the guidance is a &quot;tool&quot; for entities to assess their maturity level,  the &quot;how to&quot; on the process side should be tailored to lifecycle activities not specific technologies or implementations. 

I hope the above make sense to everyone.

Subject: Re: [SAMM] Split document - wiki

At the risk of repeating my previous mail to the list on this subject,
my view is that some of this content is required for relevance.
Presently, I don't see much that does make OpenSAMM relevant.  It would
be nice for that to change so that when one advocates the use of a
generalist and non-vendor attached maturity model, there is something to
work with besides whatever controls or process people spin up in a local
brainstorming session; a generally non-repeatable, non-standard, and
likely difficult to demonstrate proper governance should it be needed.

People want to split specific QA/maturity methods away from generalized
concept model in a wiki?  Fine.

People want to combine them?  Sure.

Just please make it relevant to people attempting to stand up a client
program or improve an existing one.  The other option is continued
irrelevance and defacto endorsement of a lock-in vendor workflow which
may or may not benefit anyone except the vendor who has used it to sell
their compliance product.

Remember how we became a compliance industry instead of a security industry.

Cheers,
