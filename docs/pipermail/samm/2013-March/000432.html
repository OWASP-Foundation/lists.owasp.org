<PRE>All,

during recent discussions in which directions OpenSAMM could evolve,
we had a discussion whether it would be useful to complement the
current model by a wiki (or similar tool) in which we can put much
more accompanying information about the model. For instance, all
information concerning how to implement a particular activity, which
tools to use, links to other OWASP projects and so forth would nicely
fit there. If we were to include them into the current model, it would
really bloat it and risk of making it unworkable in my opinion. I've
been doing this for an OpenSAMM implementation at a client recently
and this worked very well (we use this for instance for application
security standards, where we have the formal standard and then an
accompanying wiki with much more explanation and practical guidance
about the standard).

Regarding the overall structure of this wiki, there's different
options. One first and logical option would be to use the structure of
the model. Another option could be to split into the type of knowledge
that we're putting there (methods, tools, etc). A third one could be
to use a typical OpenSAMM implementation strategy (if that uberhaupt
exists)... In fact, there's different perspectives onto the
information that will be put on there, and we might have to find a way
to represent these different perspectives. On the other hand, let's
not overcomplicate things from the start :-)

Any strong opinions on whether (or not) and how to do this ?

Best,
Bart.
