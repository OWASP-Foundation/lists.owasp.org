<PRE>I agree splitting off the model off from  &quot;guidance&quot; to &quot;how to (can be
a tool)&quot; will be an important next step. 
 
Regards.

	All, 
	This is an important question: please chime in on this thread. 
	I personally believe we should indeed split the model off from
the guidance and howto supporting material, but looking forward to your
opinion!

		All,
		
		during recent discussions in which directions OpenSAMM
could evolve,
		we had a discussion whether it would be useful to
complement the
		current model by a wiki (or similar tool) in which we
can put much
		more accompanying information about the model. For
instance, all
		information concerning how to implement a particular
activity, which
		tools to use, links to other OWASP projects and so forth
would nicely
		fit there. If we were to include them into the current
model, it would
		really bloat it and risk of making it unworkable in my
opinion. I've
		been doing this for an OpenSAMM implementation at a
client recently
		and this worked very well (we use this for instance for
application
		security standards, where we have the formal standard
and then an
		accompanying wiki with much more explanation and
practical guidance
		about the standard).
		


This is a good point. I have taken a similar approach and it has worked
for me as well. Are you suggesting we spin a project to build a tool? 



		Regarding the overall structure of this wiki, there's
different
		options. One first and logical option would be to use
the structure of
		the model. Another option could be to split into the
type of knowledge
		that we're putting there (methods, tools, etc). A third
one could be
		to use a typical OpenSAMM implementation strategy (if
that uberhaupt
		exists)... In fact, there's different perspectives onto
the
		information that will be put on there, and we might have
to find a way
		to represent these different perspectives. On the other
hand, let's
		not overcomplicate things from the start :-)
		


My vote is for not overcomplicating, perhaps use the structure of the
model. The structure is simple and easy to describe a main strength IMO.



		Any strong opinions on whether (or not) and how to do
this ?
		
		Best,
		Bart.
