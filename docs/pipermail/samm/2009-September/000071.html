<PRE>I'd love to get you (and anyone else interested in helping) more involved. Specifically on your points:

1) Would the need for a security library fit under Secure Architecture? I definitely had that in mind when putting that part together... At level 1 you use recommended libraries, and then up at level 3, you customize and mandate them. How else were you thinking we'd emphasize this?

2) I definitely want to do this. That's why I syndicated all the content on the owasp.org site so that people could link things in as much as possible (and then in the next release, we could write it in directly based on the assembled content from the wiki).

3) I'm not sure what you mean by 'key security areas' so I'm not sure how to respond to this one. I've got a diagram that maps the Security Practices to phases in a generic SDLC and I'm thinking that might be good content to include in the next version, is that what you mean?

Thanks!

Pravir,

I'd like to augment SAMM in a few ways:

1) Discuss the need for a security library (this is stage 1 IMO for a  
mature secure software process)
2) Link-in other OWASP projects where appropriate (code review guide,  
ESAPI, etc)
3) Refer to key security areas and where in the SDLC they are most  
likely addressed

Are you down? I don't want to mess with your painting - SAMM is  
awesome! But I would like to jump in...

Respectfully,
Jim
