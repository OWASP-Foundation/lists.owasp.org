Subject: [SAMM]  Translation to german
Message-ID: <f0087eef-ff73-4f56-a021-3c14f3b0aa08@googlegroups.com>

Hi there

Actually I work on my Bachelorthesis which contains the mapping to ISO 
27002 and the german "BSI Grundschutzkatalog". My Thesis will be in german. 
So I looked for a german translation of openSAMM, but didn't found.

My question is, if there is anybody who will help me to translate openSAMM 
to german? Or is anybody yet on this translation, so I'll offer my help. 
I'm from Switzerland.

smike
