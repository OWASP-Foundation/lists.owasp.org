<PRE>Several thoughts:

1. Even OWASP believes it is OK to not always fix. As long as they are taking a risk-based approach (e.g. OWASP Risk Rating Method) and they are prioritizing for future releases then I think it is OK

2. I think fixing prior to production is noble but not always practical. We all know that testing occurs so late in the lifecycle where the answer isn't to just test earlier. The challenge here is in measuring the release management approach whereby there is sufficient time between the developer writing the last line of code to the time it is released. In most shops, this window is minimized and until you address this challenge, you can't do as quickly. Even the Agile crowd, wants releases to occur where this window is minimized, the key though is that they also believe in more frequent releases.

3. Since you mentioned the word &quot;outsourcer&quot;, maybe a measure of maturity is in understanding what measures of code acceptance your client had in place from a contract perspective. If an outsourcer isn't held to writing secure code in the first place then having a fixing phase won't matter. Is remediation done on a time and materials basis where budget pressures cause it to be moved to later?

4. I think this also calls out another challenge. If you look at any project management guidance whether PMI, Kanban, etc, there is no ability to define a fixing phase since it can't be proactively estimated. Remember in waterfall shops, they estimate everything before they even write a single line of code :-(

Subject: [SAMM] SAMM model - Fixing phase

Hi,
just to inform the Community that I did a presentation of SAMM at the
last OWASP Day for the e-Government in Italy.
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Italy_OWASP_Day_E-Gov_10">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Italy_OWASP_Day_E-Gov_10</A>

Thanks to the community and a special thank to Colin for the great support!

Maybe we can add it on the SAMM site?

Then, I did a &quot;SAMM assessment&quot; for a Company here in Italy and I'd like
to discuss a new item that maybe we can add to the list of the Security
Practices or maybe improve the VulnMng practice.

I see many Companies that do Security Testing but not fixing at all, or
some basic fix, but they have a security response team to manage
vulnerabilities after an attack. IMO the fixing phase before that the
app is deployed is really important to evaluate the maturity of the
sw-dev-proc.
We analize that in the Vulnerability Management practice, but in the
model we did not focus on how the Company create a fixing phase after a
Code Review or Penetration Test. Reporting this is interesting to
evaluate the efficient of an outsourcer: the time they spent to fix a
bug and how they fix it is interesting for the SAMM model.

What do you think about that?

Thanks,
Mat
