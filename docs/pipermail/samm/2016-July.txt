Subject: [SAMM] updated OWASP SAMM toolbox to v1.1.1
Message-ID: <CAAihoGt8aZSb_ESifjcky+bG-Qp9OKpd=Q0kwr91=m7CuA1+Lw@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

I uploaded v1.1.1 of the latest OWASP SAMM toolbox:
1. Replaced error in the toolbox "Roadmap Chart" tab due to local
decimal settings: replaced 0.5 by 1/2 in the formulas (was raised as
Issue 2 - now closed).
2. Updated ?Design Analysis? to ?Design Review? in Roadmap chart.
3. Cleaned up the interview tab: all answers are empty now

Updated to Github and the wiki.

The latest version is available here:
https://www.owasp.org/images/e/e3/OpenSAMM_Assessment_Toolbox_v1-1-1-Final.xlsx

kind regards

Seba

Message-ID: <9c7ba1cad209486180654c0d7a40080d@NLAMS10411.nl.deloitte.com>

Hello everyone,

Is there a tool or editable template available somewhere which allows practitioners to create roadmaps based on the SAMM model, similar to those roadmaps which are in the section "Building Assurance Models"?

Kind regards,
PJ

hi,

Yes, there is.
You can use the SAMM Toolbox for this.
It is available for dowload here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project (Updated SAMM Tool Box
link  on the right)

This spreadsheet allows you to perform assessments.
It also allows you to create a roadmap with the "Roadmap Chart" sheet.

kind regards

Seba

hi,

We see that OWASP SAMM is getting more traction in use and
people/organisations knowing about it.

But it is one of the underused and less known flagship projects within

Do you have ideas or advice on how we can better promote SAMM?
Just respond to the mailing list or to me directly, I will compile the
results in our next monthly call on Wednesday 13-Jul

Message-ID: <CAAihoGuh1UTmHKMBrwMB3ed=yOtjpNeRtzhmxviYUu2-wPPhTw@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

One of the summit outcomes was the following list of improvements to
incorporate in v1.2 of SAMM:

Focus is on updated scoring:

   1. Recover source and move it to an asciidoctor based document for
   better reproduction capabilities
   2. Clarification of maturity levels (syntactic changes to keep the text
   consistent)
   3. Not change activities but try to impose the current scoring system on
   existing activities, i.e. move from binary yes/no to the multi-tiered
   questions/answers of the current proposal.
   4. Show improvements with every activity introduced
   5. Adapt documents/toolbox for the new scoring method
   6. Update questions for 4-tiers
   7. Review and where necessary clarify current questions
   8. Consider v1.1 remarks/comments that were not withheld for the
   previous release

Targeted completion date: end of september in time for Appsec USA (October
11, 2016)

Are you ok with this list?
Any strong feelings to include/drop requirements you want to share?

Your input will be taken into account for the next monthly call on 13-July

Thanks

Seba

Hi Seba,

How do you know that it is the less known? I mean, how do you measure how much a project is used/known?

Message-ID: <CAAihoGuBya1cPvSwNnvjRtLpNoVWJtgZcQDb1QcV+Oj5fQfcXg@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

As of this month we will be discussing all the security practices of the
core model.
Objective is to update the core model towards SAMMv2.

We will start with the Strategy&Metrics practice.

I have created a placeholder for improvements here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dWa8z-qVYGiOQBto5eOL03I4LqAVmK9r-2lnJiDm-vw/edit?usp=sharing

I contains the notes of our discussions during the NY summit.

Please review these notes and have a good look at the current SM V1.1
practice
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Strategy_&_Metrics_-_1
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Strategy_&_Metrics_-_2
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Strategy_&_Metrics_-_3

Feel free to add your ideas for improving this practice in the placeholder
document linked above?

We will discuss this in our next monthly call on 13-Jul to create a first
draft, which we will then share for review with the list.

Thank you!

Kind regards,

Seba

Hi
Was it envisioned to push it to an international standardization body (i.e.
IETF, ISO/IEC or OASIS)?
Potentialy a certification process could help gaining traction for adoption.

hi,

Hard to tell, it is more a "gut feeling".

objectively, the number of pageviews of
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project is 28,016 times.
but we have moved to this new project page only recently (page was created
in November 2014).
the previous category page which now redirects to the SAMM project page
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model&redirect=no
was viewed 200,844 times.

To compare this with e.g. ASVS: that page has been viewed 1,089,695 times.

I have requested to Matt to have the number of downloads of the SAMM
documents, I currently do not have these numbers.

searching for OWASP SAMM results in
about 7.150 results  on Google
searching for OpenSAMM results in
about 53.200 results

to compare this with e.g. BSIMM, that has
about 20.000 results (0,44 seconds)

we started a list of SAMM users here
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OpenSAMM_Adopters
but that never got real traction
(by the way: if you use it: add yourself or let me add it for you)

any other metrics that I forgot?

regards

Seba

Subject: [SAMM] how to get better at promoting SAMM?

hi,

We see that OWASP SAMM is getting more traction in use and people/organisations knowing about it.

But it is one of the underused and less known flagship projects within  OWASP.

Do you have ideas or advice on how we can better promote SAMM?
Just respond to the mailing list or to me directly, I will compile the results in our next monthly call on Wednesday 13-Jul

thanks!

Seba

I don't think this was the vision intended by Pravir when he created the model many years ago. Check his original videos and talks from the Minnesota and other conferences that date almost 8 yrs ago.  In the videos, Pravir describes how the model was created and the reasons for it.

Perhaps SAMM needs to be marketed like every other product on the internet.
Create an interactive marketing program for SAMM.?
CO-BRANDING - Add SAMM on other products/services that get communicated?
EMAIL - targeted Email campaigns, consistent messaging, engaging content
WEBCASTS - How to webcast series. How to do assessments successfully using SAMM...., Assessments Role playing, how to use samm?WEBSITE REFRESH...? ? add testimonials, Corporate sponsors, Thought Leadership, success metrics, how to implement it, where to go for help...

etc.

?
Thanks, ?Frank

 Subject: [SAMM] how to get better at promoting SAMM?
   
hi,
We see that OWASP SAMM is getting more traction in use and people/organisations knowing about it.
But it is one of the underused and less known flagship projects within ?OWASP.
Do you have ideas or advice on how we can better promote SAMM?Just respond to the mailing list or to me directly, I will compile the results in our next monthly call on Wednesday 13-Jul
thanks!
Seba
