All,
I'm familiar with some of the work that has gone into BSIMM.  I was merely
asking if there are ways (other than mapping OpenSAMM to BSIMM) to compare
maturity across organizations just using OpenSAMM results.  Why can we have
a similar community where we share maturity against peers in the industry
while controlling commercial sensitivity of the data?

Thanks,
Khash

Does the OpenSAMM BSIMM mapping only occurs at the activity level? Wouldn't
it also be helpful to bring it up one step higher and map it at the 12
security function level? So we compare our OpenSAMM maturity with industry
BSIMM at the scorecard level.  Any thoughts?

Also, I joined this discussion late. Is this going to be a spreadsheet
similar to what we currently have, or an actual calculator to do the
conversion automatically from one maturity level to the other?

Lastly, we're looking into cloning the web-based self-assessment provided
by folks at Asterisk. Any recommendation or lessons learned?

Khash,

Again, BSIMM is forked from OpenSAMM so I can't see the advantage in
OpenSAMM replicating this since it appears that we would be
"attempting to catch up" to the significant lead of BSIMM without
adding any tangible value to OpenSAMM.

Is www.linkedin.com/in/kiani you by chance?

Dear all,

It is already 2 weeks ago, but here are the meeting notes of our very
productive OpenSAMM workshop in New York on Thursday November 21, 2013
1:00pm - 5:00pm

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwoDVsWyhoWksBiLIRh8UOh-
QCs8H7QMqrSUsS13WzU/edit

The actions points will be moved to the online SAMM work package list:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AocY8G2SHaWKdHhKZXdnek1hcFFRTWhzN1NRQWd0d1E&usp=sharing#gid=0

A big thank you to all the participants!
I am looking forward to include the valuable feedback and material that was
shown during the workshop session in the upcoming versions of SAMM.

Kind regards

Seba

Hi,

I have updated the BSIMM mapping with the observed activity data and mapped
it back to SAMM activities with some Excel VBA scripting.

The updated Excel spreadsheet is available here:
https://www.owasp.org/images/f/f9/OpenSAMM-BSIMM-V-Mapping-data.xlsx

The resulting overview is available in a presentation here:
https://www.owasp.org/images/6/66/OpenSAMM_-_BSIMM-V_mapping.pptx

Some interesting results I would like to share are:

The *most observed SAMM activities *per security practice are:

   - SM Build and maintain assurance program roadmap
   - PC Establish project audit practice
   - EG Build and maintain technical guidelines
   - TA Develop attacker profile from software architecture
   - SR Evaluate security and compliance guidance for requirements
   - SA Explicitly apply security principles to design
   - DR Analyze design against known security requirements
   - CR Perform point-review of high-risk code
   - ST Conduct penetration testing on software releases
   - VM Create informal security response team(s)
   - EH Monitor baseline environment configuration status
   - OE Maintain formal operational security guides

No real surprises here, although the low number of observed developer
awareness training seems odd.

SAMM activities that are not observed are:

   - SM 3.A Conduct periodic industry-wide cost comparisons
   - TA 2.B Adopt a weighting system for measurement of threats
   - TA 3.B Elaborate threat models with compensating controls
   - SR 2.A Build an access control matrix for resources and capabilities
   - SR 2.B Specify security requirements based on known risks
   - SR 3.B Expand audit program for security requirements
   - DR 3.B Establish release gates for design review
   - CR 2.B Integrate code analysis into development process
   - VM 2.B Adopt a security issue disclosure process
   - EH 1.A Maintain operational environment specification
   - EH 1.B Identify and install critical security upgrades and patches
   - EH 3.B Expand audit program for environment configuration
   - OE 1.A Capture critical security information for deployment
   - OE 1.B Document procedures for typical application alerts
   - OE 2.A Create per-release change management procedures
   - OE 3.A Expand audit program for operational information

At first sight this seem to be a lot of SAMM activities which are not
observed as part of the 67 leading software security initiatives?
Some of these seem surprising to me: e.g. not integrating code analysis
into development process? or no identification and installation of critical
security upgrades and patches?

We should probably review the current mappings to see if these activities
are not buried in one of the BSIMM activities and update the mapping?
If we end up with a list of SAMM activities that are really not observed,
we should probably consider removing them in SAMM v2.0?

As always: your feedback and review is greatly appreciated!

Kind regards,

Seba

Thanks to BSIMM and Luis for the data and the updated mapping!
