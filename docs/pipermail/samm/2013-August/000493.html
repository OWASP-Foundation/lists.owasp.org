<PRE>Seba,

I am concerned that there is not enough to differentiate from
<A HREF="http://www.bsimm.com/">http://www.bsimm.com/</A> and that OpenSAMM has lost considerable ground
and is now attempting to duplicate BSIMM success.

&gt;<i> A first set of activities relates to the building of the OpenSAMM community.
</I>&gt;<i> For this matter, the project will ensure the creation and distribution of

</I>&gt;<i> workshops at the main OWASP AppSec conferences (USA, Europe, Asia, and Latin
</I>&gt;<i> America). At the end of the project, a dedicated OpenSAMM summit will be
</I>&gt;<i> organized to wrap up the project and disseminate the project results.
</I>
BSIMM has significant press already i.e. <A HREF="http://www.bsimm.com/press/.">http://www.bsimm.com/press/.</A>
I am not aware of any recent press for OpenSAMM i.e. I can't locate a
single recent example within <A HREF="http://www.opensamm.org/news/">http://www.opensamm.org/news/</A>

BSIMM has hosted conferences in the past which have positive writeups
by their end users e.g.
<A HREF="http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2012/11/bsimm-community-conference-2012.html,">http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2012/11/bsimm-community-conference-2012.html,</A>

&gt;<i> A second set of activities relates to the gathering of empirical data. Two

</I>&gt;<i> resource (student, or a professional in sabbatical mode) do a number of case
</I>&gt;<i> studies of organizations to gather such data in a more proactive manner.
</I>
Again, it appears that OpenSAMM are duplicating BSIMM i.e.
<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2012-April/000350.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2012-April/000350.html</A>

Politically students won't be received well in this role based on
their lack of experience.  Hence why BSIMM surveys are undertaken by
respected appsec authorities i.e. Gary McGraw, Brian Chess, etc

</I>
OWASP already provide this i.e.
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internationalization#I_want_to_translate_OWASP_Materials_to_.5BPut_your_language_here.5D.2C_Where_should_I_start.3F">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internationalization#I_want_to_translate_OWASP_Materials_to_.5BPut_your_language_here.5D.2C_Where_should_I_start.3F</A>

As I understand the translators have not been funded, is this not the
case?  If so this may be considered a misleading statement?

</I>
As I understand <A HREF="http://www.opensamm.org/download/">http://www.opensamm.org/download/</A> (which is of good
quality) was developed without funding?

As OpenSAMM is considered the quality benchmark within OWASP what will
this funding provide above and beyond this benchmark? If OWASP can't
justify this then it appears we are seeking funds via deception (which
is not be the case).

How does the above differ from
<A HREF="http://www.opensamm.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/20120803-samm-scorecard-chart-generation.zip">http://www.opensamm.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/20120803-samm-scorecard-chart-generation.zip</A>
?

Also, management (who are the intended audiences of maturity models)
prefer a single page &quot;Executive Brief&quot; and a complex web application
might just confuse them with all the browser warnings :)

</I>
COBIT, ITIL (the &quot;security&quot; section of ITILv3 is ISO 2700x), etc are
&quot;control&quot; based frameworks and hence their implementation is less
likely to succeed when compared to maturity models such as OpenSAMM
(since control based frameworks have an all or nothing approach which
the organisation might not be mature enough to sustain)

We should have listed &quot;Capability Maturity Model for Software
Development&quot; published by &quot;Carnegie Mellon University&quot; since
integration with other maturity &quot;standards&quot; is easier.
