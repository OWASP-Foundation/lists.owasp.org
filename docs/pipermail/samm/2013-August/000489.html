<PRE>Dear all,

Please find below our OpenSAMM HOST grant application.
Details about HOST are available on
<A HREF="http://investments.opencybersecurity.org/">http://investments.opencybersecurity.org/</A>

Regardless of the HOST grant approval, this application provides the
foundation of what we want to achieve with SAMM in the coming years:
&lt;snip&gt;
*

The project consists of a number of complementary activities that will
improve the OpenSAMM model and its global adoption. We explain these
activities in more detail below.

A first set of activities relates to the building of the OpenSAMM community.
For this matter, the project will ensure the creation and distribution of
quarterly OpenSAMM newsletters, as well as the organization of OpenSAMM
workshops at the main OWASP AppSec conferences (USA, Europe, Asia, and
Latin America). At the end of the project, a dedicated OpenSAMM summit will
be organized to wrap up the project and disseminate the project results.

A second set of activities relates to the gathering of empirical data. Two
different approaches will be taken for this milestone. First, we will
create two questionnaires to gather specific data. These questionnaires
will be sent within the OWASP community and beyond, and limited incentives
for completing will be provided. Secondly, we intend to have a project
support resource (student, or a professional in sabbatical mode) do a
number of case studies of organizations to gather such data in a more
proactive manner.

A third set of activities relates to improving the model. Two new versions
of the model will be defined (version 1.1 and version 2.0) in which
specific improvements will be implemented. Furthermore, we will further
work on translating the model into four new languages to facilitate the
adoption in non-native English speaking countries.

&gt;<i>From an education perspective, we will create training material to allow
</I>people to do self-study and/or give presentations on the OpenSAMM model.

To support data gathering and training, an online web application will be
created to enable people to do specific analysis of their situation and to
get advice on where improvements could be implemented with respect to
software assurance in the organization. Such a tool is, to our knowledge,
the first in its kind, and it has the potential of supporting a large
community.

Finally, a last activity relates to standardization of software assurance.
Here, the goal is to work together with standardization bodies such as ISO,
NIST, and potentially others to consider creating a common standard for
software assurance. Likewise, we will consider linking OpenSAMM to
important other standards such as COBIT, ITIL, and so forth.*
*&lt;/snip&gt;*
*

Your feedback, and even more your support during the next months and years,
will be used to &quot;mature&quot; SAMM and make a serious dent in insecure software.

I would like to thank the project team and especially Samantha for putting
together a fantastic HOST application!

Kind regards,

Seba

Dear HOST Program Managers,

I am writing today on behalf of OWASP and the Project Leaders and
Contributors of the OWASP OpenSAMM Project. I would like to submit their
application for investment which is attached to this message. Please feel
free to reach out to me with any questions you may have about anything
within the proposal.

We hope to hear from you soon regarding our application.

Thank you,

Samantha Groves
