Subject: [SAMM] How to use SAMM in a software dev project for school

Dear SAMM,

I am doing a Masters program that involve using SAMM in the Software Development Life Cycle. I am not sure how to start. Do you have any practical examples or Case studies that I could
use as an example to help me apply it to my software development project for
school.

Best Regards,
Andrew

Andrew,

Read http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/solutions/dev/index.cfm for
background on CMMI (you might be seeking an SDL instead).

You'll will want to implement the "lightweight" section first i.e.
http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/bsammbo/19

Also, there is the "skeleton" within BSIMM i.e.
http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/bsammbo/13

You might also want to compare yourself to the educational vertical
and the North American and European cultures by consulting BSIMM also
i.e. http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/bsammbo/21.
