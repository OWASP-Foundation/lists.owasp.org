If a large enterprise wanted to annoint an individual to rollout SAMM,
what would the job description look like? What are some of the
characteristics this individual would need in order to be successful?
Could they be successful in being a process weenie alone or is something
else required? Do they need to know how to program? Do they need to know
about project/program management?

Hi
My exp of samm would dictate;

Regarding a process weeine this actually helps, experience in interviewing
(audit interviews) and getting to an accurate answer us very
important. Someone with SDLC security and
with 27001 exposure would be great at the job.
SDLC experience (From secure dev to change control to awareness and training
rollout etc) is important and also knowledge of the industry being audited;
this helps with developing a roadmap and what to focus on.

The individual doesn't necessarily need to be a developer, but he or she
does need to understand developers and the how they interact within a
team.  When designing and implementing an SDLC process, the activities,
gates, and other components must fit in well with the development team's
current style.

knowledge. Looking for insight into how it would feel. Would it feel
like an Enterprise PMO or more like an Agile Coach, ScrumMaster?

Not quite sure of how to flush it out, but let me share more on my
thoughts for asking.  
 
1. I need to complete an HR approved job description such that in my day
job, we get the opportunity for someone to have as their fulltime job
the championing of SAMM internally. We want to do this via "influence"
over "command and control". We will of course have executive support
(they will sign off on funding) but will only be periodic mouthpieces.
 
2. As an observer, I think all of the analysis / comparisons on maturity
models in this space have outlined more of the process. What is sorely
lacking is the "profile" of the individuals and what characteristic
about them made their adoption of SAMM successful. So, I want to capture
more of the people aspects and will make a great supporting document to
SAMM.
 
3. If we capture the above, it could also serve as input into something
I think would absolutely rock. I know that folks will jump all over me
for mentioning certification, but if you look at Scrum, the notion of a
Certified ScrumMaster has caused lots of mouthpieces to emerge. I do
want to expend effort in creating something similiar to help evangelize
SAMM.

....Sure any change to SDLC is more a cultural effort rather than a
technical one.
The idea of secure development needs to be embraced by the organisation and
a belief needs to be developed so there is understanding "why I am doing
this"
Any good individuals with ISO, Consultancy, Advisor roles need to be able to
convey requirements and gaps in an influencing way and a "the benefits to
you are...." so you get developer buy-in.

So key (on a human level) is to get the right personality who is not a
"Policeman-auditor" but rather an influencer/advisor explaining the positive
reasons (both to an organisation and individual) for SAMM, applying a road
map and secure app dev. People involved in CMM may also fit this profile
also if they were any good at it.

On the other hand some organisations use "carrots" and "sticks" throughout
the SDLC process. reward if you have the lowest fault density /non compliant
issues  for your last code review. Slap on the head if you are the worst. I
found in dev organisations that the "Secure development team of the year"
award worked well, gave recognition and demonstrated how serious the org is.

I'm not sure if there should be a "certified SAMM auditor", this could
cheapen the brand, SAMM is small enough so all-of-a-sudden everyone will be
certified etc etc

another 10 cent (out of change).

You may want to bring ASVS into the discussion as well. I've spoken with
several ISACA chapters about appsec and it generally resonates well.

Pravir,

I'm in on this work group. ?I've already done a preliminary mapping of
SAMM's maturity levels to ISM3 levels. I can send it out the group early
next week.

Vicente's offer to help would be most welcome.

Dear all

I have created an initial spreadsheet as per Pravir's suggestion,
including the separate activities - attached.

Perhaps we can divide up the ISM3 v2.3 (the current version) processes
amongst those of us with time to look at this? ?Processes ordered/case
as per v2.3 document contents:

GP-1 Knowledge management
GP-2 ISM System and Business Audit
GP-3 ISM Design and Evolution
SSP-1 Report to stakeholders
SSP-3 Strategic vision
SSP-4 Define Division of Duties roles
SSP-6 Allocate resources for information security
TSP-1 Report to strategic management
TSP-2 Manage allocated resources
TSP-3 Define Security Targets and Security Objectives
TSP-6 Security Architecture
TSP-4 Service Level Management
TSP-13 Insurance Management
TSP-7 Background Checks
TSP-8 Personnel Security
TSP-9 Security Personnel Training
TSP-10 Disciplinary Process
TSP-11 Security Awareness
TSP-14 Information Operations
OSP-1 Report to tactical management
OSP-2 Security Procurement
OSP-3 Inventory Management
OSP-4 Information Systems Environmental Change Control
OSP-5 Environment Patching
OSP-6 Environment Clearing
OSP-7 Environment Hardening
OSP-8 Software Development Lifecycle Control
OSP-9 Security Measures Change Control
OSP-16 Segmentation and Filtering Management
OSP-17 Malware Protection Management
OSP-11 Access control
OSP-12 User Registration
OSP-14 Physical Environment Protection Management
OSP-26 Enhanced Reliability and Availability Management
OSP-10 Backup Management
OSP-15 Operations Continuity Management
OSP-27 Archiving Management
OSP-19 Internal Technical Audit
OSP-20 Incident Emulation
OSP-21 Information Quality and Compliance Probing
OSP-22 Alerts Monitoring
OSP-28 External Events Detection and Analysis
OSP-23 Internal Events Detection and Analysis
OSP-24 Handling of incidents and near incidents
OSP-25 Forensics

We should also decide on the approach. ?Are we trying to find all ISM3
processes that might include something relevant to each SAMM objective
or activity, or something else? ?A process like "OSP-8 Software
Development Lifecycle Control" might be mapped to every SAMM activity
perhaps, and "OSP-24 Handling of incidents and near incidents" might
only be mapped to VM1, VM2 and VM3 activities?

Do we need to consider the Maturity Levels (Basic, SME, eCommerce, etc)?

While going through ISM3, would it be worth mapping to ASVS at the same time?

Colin

Dear all

I have created an initial spreadsheet as per Pravir's suggestion,
including the separate activities - attached.

Perhaps we can divide up the ISM3 v2.3 (the current version) processes
amongst those of us with time to look at this?  Processes ordered/case
as per v2.3 document contents:

GP-1 Knowledge management
GP-2 ISM System and Business Audit
GP-3 ISM Design and Evolution
SSP-1 Report to stakeholders
SSP-3 Strategic vision
SSP-4 Define Division of Duties roles
SSP-6 Allocate resources for information security
TSP-1 Report to strategic management
TSP-2 Manage allocated resources
TSP-3 Define Security Targets and Security Objectives
TSP-6 Security Architecture
TSP-4 Service Level Management
TSP-13 Insurance Management
TSP-7 Background Checks
TSP-8 Personnel Security
TSP-9 Security Personnel Training
TSP-10 Disciplinary Process
TSP-11 Security Awareness
TSP-14 Information Operations
OSP-1 Report to tactical management
OSP-2 Security Procurement
OSP-3 Inventory Management
OSP-4 Information Systems Environmental Change Control
OSP-5 Environment Patching
OSP-6 Environment Clearing
OSP-7 Environment Hardening
OSP-8 Software Development Lifecycle Control
OSP-9 Security Measures Change Control
OSP-16 Segmentation and Filtering Management
OSP-17 Malware Protection Management
OSP-11 Access control
OSP-12 User Registration
OSP-14 Physical Environment Protection Management
OSP-26 Enhanced Reliability and Availability Management
OSP-10 Backup Management
OSP-15 Operations Continuity Management
OSP-27 Archiving Management
OSP-19 Internal Technical Audit
OSP-20 Incident Emulation
OSP-21 Information Quality and Compliance Probing
OSP-22 Alerts Monitoring
OSP-28 External Events Detection and Analysis
OSP-23 Internal Events Detection and Analysis
OSP-24 Handling of incidents and near incidents
OSP-25 Forensics

We should also decide on the approach.  Are we trying to find all ISM3
processes that might include something relevant to each SAMM objective
or activity, or something else?  A process like "OSP-8 Software
Development Lifecycle Control" might be mapped to every SAMM activity
perhaps, and "OSP-24 Handling of incidents and near incidents" might
only be mapped to VM1, VM2 and VM3 activities?

Do we need to consider the Maturity Levels (Basic, SME, eCommerce, etc)?

While going through ISM3, would it be worth mapping to ASVS at the same time?

Dear All,

Regarding this mapping, I am under the impression SAMM is mainly about
Software Development. This means there is a strong match between SAMM
and the ISM3 process "OSP-8 Software Development Lifecycle Control"

I attach a preliminary mapping, which can be improved by identifying
what are the deliverables produced completely of in part by each
activity, among the following

OSP-081-Software Development Security Controls
OSP-082-Information Security Requirements
OSP-083-Information Security Requirements Test Report
OSP-194-Source Code Review Procedure
OSP-195-Source Code Review Report
Information Security Targets
Alerts, Fixes and Threats Report
Source Code Review Report
Information Security Requirements Test Report
Metrics Report

Is there any deliverable I am missing?

Regards

Vicente

That's very helpful.  There might be some more operation aspects, but
I'll work through it now.
