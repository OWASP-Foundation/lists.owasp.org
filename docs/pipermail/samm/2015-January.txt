Seba,

FYI, I am trying to figure out (get permission?) to sponsor Yan's travel
with Chapter funds.  I sent an email to Alison this morning.
Do you know what approvals I might need (I am the chapter leader for MSP) ?
BTW, Yan is an MSP Chapter member and I am trying to participate more with
the SAMM project.

Regards,

Alex
