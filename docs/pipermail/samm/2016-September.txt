Hi,

See the question below.
I unfortunately am not available to do this, but maybe somebody else from
the team is available/willing to do this?

If so: please contact Albert directly?

Hello Seba,



Software AG and Fraunhofer SIT are organizing CAST workshop on software
development security on 10 November in Darmstadt, Germany. This is a
regular event that happens every year and we invite speakers from various
companies and research institutes to talk about subjects related to
software development security. The program of the last year could be seen
on the CAST website: https://www.cast-forum.de/workshops/infos/209 The
event is in English and German.



This year, a new SAMM was published. We think it would be great if someone
could join us for this event to talk about SAMM and explain how the new one
evolves and differs from the previous version. Do you think there is
someone who could come to Darmstadt and speak on behalf of SAMM/OWASP?

Following up on the announcement a couple of months ago, the HP tool was
uploaded to Github this summer.

Here you can find the tool, together with installation instructions:
https://github.com/OWASP/SAMM-TOOL

Try it out and let us know what you like or what can be improved?

A big thanks to the team at HP for creating this & donating it to the

Thanks!

Subject: [SAMM] Extra call to work on SAMMv2 - Strategy and Metrics (28-Sep)
Message-ID: <CAAihoGu=c_c-LmDpdvwREFtM+JO3tR9ixz7kzx9PE12xnB9+zg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


The monthly calls are really used to track & discuss the V1.2 progress.


In the mean time we will schedule extra SAMMv2 calls, every 4th Wednesday
of the month.

We will start with discussing all the security practices of the core model.

Objective is to update the core model towards SAMMv2.

First call is next Wednesday!

I have created a work document for improvements on the first practice
(Strategy & Metrics):

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dWa8z-qVYGiOQBto5eOL03I4LqAVmK9r-2lnJiDm-vw/edit?usp=sharing
It contains the notes of our discussions during the NY summit.

I have expanded this with:

   - Guidance on how to review & improve the practice
   - Some general principles to keep in mind:
   - Improvement placeholders


Here is your homework :-)

1) first READ the current practice
2) REVIEW the summit notes
3) THINK :-) and review how you apply this practice in your
team/organisation
4) if you have improvement suggestions: ADD them to the working document
(use the template)
5) if you can make it: JOIN our call next Wednesday (28-Sep at 21h30 CEST /
3:30pm EST.)

After the call, we will share our notes for review and work towards an
improved practice for the next SAMMv2 call (and at the same time start
working on the next practice ...)

This is your change to influence and improve our core SAMM model!

Thank you,

Kind regards,

Seba

For people that participated: please *complete/correct* the notes?

If you are interested, but do not understand some of the notes or you have
a strong opinion: *let us know* on the mailing list or as comment in the

By the next SAMMv2 call (26-Oct) we will have a draft outline of the new
S&M practice to be discussed
I will also prepare the next practice (Policy & Compliance) placeholder for
discussion.

Thank you
