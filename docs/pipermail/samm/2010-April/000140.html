<PRE>This question has popped up a few times. You're correct in thinking that
should be scored a 0+, in general. But in this situation, I think the
presence of the &quot;operational security guide with each product release&quot;
(level 2 activity) would subsume the level 1 activities, right? Meaning, if
you're actually delivering security guides, then you also are delivering the
security notes and details of alerts and error conditions. Or am I missing
something?
