<PRE>No I believe you're correct, and that's the response I've given. It's not
very likely that you would be delivering items further up the assessment
without having delivering earlier activities.

I think in a real world situation you wouldn't often run into this
conditions, but it's hard to say as I'm only starting to go through this at
my organisation at the moment.

Thank you for your comments Pravir.

Regards,

Christian

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A friend of mine who was having a play with the SAMM Excel assessment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scorecard asked me a pretty question and I thought maybe I should bounce it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off you guys to confirm the scoring logic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> His use case was what if within the Deployment -&gt; Operational Enablement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you had the following responses:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you deliver security notes with the majority of software releases? No
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are security-related alerts and error conditions documented for most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects? No
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are most projects utilizing a change management process that's well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understood? Yes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do project teams deliver an operational security guide with each product
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release? Yes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My understanding of the levels would be that this would score a &quot;0+&quot;. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guess his concerns were what if you did everything except for a single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> activity in the 0-1 range, you would still only score a &quot;0+&quot;. I believe the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likelihood of this occurring to be low, given that most of the activities
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have dependencies on previous activities, but I just wanted to ask the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question and see what you thought?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
