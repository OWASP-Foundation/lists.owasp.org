<PRE>Hi All,

A friend of mine who was having a play with the SAMM Excel assessment
scorecard asked me a pretty question and I thought maybe I should bounce it
off you guys to confirm the scoring logic.

His use case was what if within the Deployment -&gt; Operational Enablement you
had the following responses:
--
Do you deliver security notes with the majority of software releases? No
Are security-related alerts and error conditions documented for most
projects? No
--
Are most projects utilizing a change management process that's well
understood? Yes
Do project teams deliver an operational security guide with each product
release? Yes
--
....

My understanding of the levels would be that this would score a &quot;0+&quot;. I
guess his concerns were what if you did everything except for a single
activity in the 0-1 range, you would still only score a &quot;0+&quot;. I believe the
likelihood of this occurring to be low, given that most of the activities
have dependencies on previous activities, but I just wanted to ask the
question and see what you thought?

Regards,

Christian
