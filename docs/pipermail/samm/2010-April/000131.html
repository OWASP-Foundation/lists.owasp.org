<PRE>Lots of interesting points to consider, James. The main one that I've run
into is when an organization does a lot of outsourced development. SAMM was
built with focus on in-house dev, so this case presents a bit of a hiccup
for application of the model.

For the in-house stuff, SAMM basically works out of the box. For the
outsourced stuff, I've recommended that clients focus on the Verification
practices and activities, to which I also added a few others cherry-picked
from the other business functions.

I'm curious as to what other folks see as the &quot;right way&quot; for firms to
handle and control outsourced dev? A close corollary is COTS... the mic is
open on that one too :)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there an ideal ratio between functional and negative testing?

</I>&gt;<i> If there is maturity, how can we measure the scalability of the process?
