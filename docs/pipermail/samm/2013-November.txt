Message-ID: <CAAihoGvs9jawN71KBWBTsOnWYwJw6x-kobVF53HK+wob12rYjg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Next week we organise our second OpenSAMM workshop as part of the Project
Summit in New York.

Details and agenda are available on: http://tinyurl.com/samm-ny (Google doc)

Timing: Thursday November 21, 2013 1:00pm - 5:00pm (NY local time)
Location: Sky Lounge (16th Floor) (NY Marriott Marquis)

During the AppSec conferences, the SAMM project team organises workshops
for you to influence the direction SAMM evolves. This is an excellent
opportunity to exchange experiences with your peers. Understanding of SAMM
is a prerequisite for participation in this OWASP summit session.

Agenda:
* Introduction / getting to know each other
* Project status and goals
* OpenSAMM inventory of tools and templates
* Case studies / sharing experiences
* What do we need (thinking about improvements, can be anything ranging
from translations over tools to model improvements)
* What do we need next (prioritization)
* Call for involvement (responsibilities), identity owners / teams for
specific topics
* Next steps
* Source/build control

The focus will be on face-to-face interaction on site, we will try to
involve remote participants when practical with a gotomeeting session.

If you plan to attend: add your name in the agenda:

See you in New York next week!

Kind regards,

Seba Deleersnyder
co-lead OWASP SAMM

Hello!
My name is Brian King and I'm new around here. I work for a financial
services company, but am looking to contribute to OpenSAMM on my own time,
at least to begin.

I volunteered to create the QuickStart guide.

I won't be in New York next week, but I would like to get the guide out to
the group before you all meet up there.

I have a first draft complete - is there a good place where I can share it
with the group to get some feedback?

I noticed in the Work Packages spreadsheet, some folks are using Github, so
I'm following along that way.

https://github.com/mrbbking/opensamm-quickstart

The draft is plain text for two reasons:
1 - to stay focused on the content
2 - to make it easy to incorporate into other packages

I think the purpose of a QuickStart is to help the reader understand the
fundamental parameters of the topic.
A QuickStart should help a person decide whether to continue, and if so,
where to go next.

In this draft, I tried to stay focused on a quick overview, and point to
the other existing resources to fill in the details.

I welcome any comments or suggestions.

Hello everyone,

I took the liberty of updating the existing mapping to BSIMM up to what was
at that point the most current BSIMM release. A week or two ago they
released BSIMM-V. This means that the updates to that model could be again
mapped to SAMM. I'll look into it later in the month. For the time being,
I'm attaching the mapping SAMM 1.0 - BSIMM 4.0

have a nice weekend everyone.

Best regards,

Luis

Thanks for the feedback, and the new home for editing. I'll delete the
Github version, so we don't have two copies.

I replied to all of the comments, and made some changes based on that
feedback - there were some good ideas in there!

The comments I saw were all anonymous - if you made a comment and you're
happy with the resolution, please mark it as "resolved" so we can keep
focused on current discussions.

Hello everyone,

a few weeks ago Seba pointed me to a "Bachelor's Thesis" from Fabian
Streitel written at the University of Technology of Munich. The thesis was
written in German, what kept the applicability of its contents limited to
those people who can read the language. Some of the comments made their way
to the "issues" list kept at google code. The corresponding tickets are
5,6,7,8,9 and a couple more.

I read the document and summarized it as concisely as I could in English,
so that it's applicability can increment. Many valid points are made, and
they should certainly be discussed as part of the intent to overhaul the
maturity model.

The document is attached to this email.

Greetings,

Luis

the subject of academic research and debate! Congratulations to

Hi everyone,

I just finished updating the mapping between openSAMM and the latest BSIMM
version (5). There were few changes from the previous mapping I posted to
the list a couple of weeks ago. Four activities changed level and one extra
activity was added: CMVM3.4 Operate a bug bounty program

Attached is the excel file with the updated mapping

What is the main difference(s) to the "lightweight" implementation of OpenSAMM?

Hello SAMM community,

It was good meeting Seba and others at AppSec USA.  I wasn't able to attend
the workshop, but hopefully next time.

I would like to get everyone's thoughts on comparing results with the
industry and our peers. Similar to the BSIMM community which meets and
compares maturity levels and strategy.

Does SAMM currently have such community in place to provide a measuring
stick to determine where we stand relative to others?

If so, who are the players and how do we get involved?

Thank you!
Khash

You could add yourself to https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OpenSAMM_Adopters

The sample of each contributing European and North American
corporation undertaken by BSIMM is not published due to commercial
sensitivities.  However BSIMM does published various baselines of
their sample for comparative purposes.

Recently the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis
Center (FS-ISAC) published a recommendation to share the deliverables
of  vBSIMM, i.e. BSIMM for Vendors, and this document is mirrored at
http://docs.ismgcorp.com/files/external/WP_FSISAC_Third_Party_Software_Security_Working_Group.pdf
(FS-ISAC had indicated that it would be published on their web page
hosted at https://www.fsisac.com/ in late November sometime).

The quickstart guide isn't meant to describe a different kind of
implementation - its purpose is to give a reader some guideposts to build
on.

I imagine a person coming to SAMM not knowing where to begin. The
Quickstart guide is meant to help them get a quick understanding of what
SAMM offers. Once they know have this basic understanding, they would go on
to the more in-depth materials.

Not just you.

I'm on Mac OS X, here.
I Safari, it's fine.
In Preview (after downloading it), it's fine.
But in Chrome, there are quite a few sections where there's garbage.
If I copy-paste it as text, it comes out fine, but it doesn't render
correctly in the viewer.

Brian,

Yes, mine was a recent download too.

In the past (with previous downloads) Preview (OSX) has rendered the
PDF correctly.

Can anyone provide the hash using "openssl dgst" of their PDF?

Brian,

I would recommend that you insert the following at line #48 of
https://github.com/mrbbking/opensamm-quickstart/blob/master/OpenSamm-quickstart.txt:

   1. http://bsimm.com/i/BSIMM-V-activities-observed.png
   2. http://bsimm.com/i/BSIMM-V-Spider-Earth67.png
   3. http://bsimm.com/i/BSIMM-V-spider-Top10.png
   4. http://bsimm.com/i/BSIMM-V-spider-ISV-vs-FINSV.png

Also you may want to mention
http://cmmiinstitute.com/cmmi-solutions/cmmi-for-development/ for the
background on Software Development specific maturity models.

You will need to clarify further how
https://github.com/mrbbking/opensamm-quickstart/blob/master/OpenSamm-quickstart.txt
differs to the Lightweight approach of OpenSAMM since it appears (to
me) to be its sole recommendation.  Please correct me if I am wrong?

That stated, I believe a better approach for a quickstart guide would
be how to integrate OpenSAMM with popular governance frameworks such
as PCI-DSS, ISMS (ISO 27001), etc?

Please let me know your thoughts?

You can score against SAMM and then use the mapping from SAMM to BSIMM
to compare to others.

That is very helpful. Was that based on Pravir previous version?

If someone could review it, maybe we should update the SAMM website with this?

Thanks for your comments, Christian!

I agree with Seba's response for the most part. The Quickstart guide is
really an exercise in cutting things out - what's the least amount of
detail we can cover, but still give a person a clear understanding of what
SAMM is all about?

Even so, I think I'm missing part of your comment, which could make the
Quickstart guide better if I understood better:

You mentioned "the Lightweight approach of OpenSAMM" again.
Do you mean that SAMM is "lightweight" in comparison to other standards, or
that there is a defined way to implement SAMM in a "lightweight" manner?

If there is a defined "lightweight approach" *for* SAMM, then I'm not
familiar with it. Could you give a link or two to get me started?

If we're comparing to other standards, then I think there may be a place
for it in the Quickstart. For people who work with those other standards,
it would be helpful here to say just a few words about how they relate. I'm
imagining a single paragraph that covers the most significant "other
standards", without distracting people who don't already know those other
standards.

I could use some help with that. Is there anyone on the list who can touch
on the differences & similarities with the other relevant standards in just
a few words?  I'll try to fit it in and we can all see what it looks like
then.

The "lightweight" approach of OpenSAMM is outlined on p21 (out of 96
pages based on the PDF page numbering) of v1.0 of OpenSAMM.

I have extracted a screenshot of "lightweight" approach of OpenSAMM on
p21 within http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/BSAMMBO/13 too.

The two most recent governance standards that I have implemented since
August 2013 are:
- PCI DSS v2.0, v3.0 was just released this month (November 2013) and;
- http://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/ism/

Let me know if these are of interest?

I would also consider
http://cmmiinstitute.com/cmmi-getting-started/cmmi-compatibility/cmmi-and-iso/mapping-iso-standards-to-cmmi-dev-v1-2/
but I haven't read this yet.

Colin is correct and the relationship is that BSIMM was forked from
OpenSAMM Beta, which was released in August 2008.

Also, BSIMM has a table for "Twelve Core Activities Everybody Does" on
p59 with their fifth release which might also be helpful in any
comparison activity.

I would recommend that this be reviewed once the next release of
OpenSAMM is published in at least draft format so that any differences
within BSIMM (including Release 5) that have been incorporated since
their fork OpenSAMM Beta can be considered for integration prior to
the final version of the next release of OpenSAMM.

Hi everyone,

answering Colin's question: yes, the comparison starts from the xls file
available at the openSAMM website. The original author, afaik, is Pravir. I
did BSIMM 4.0 first and then BSIMM-V, which had only a few changes. It'd be
great if someone looked over it.

Greetings,

Luis
