I noticed SAMM's business functions were included in a slide deck
about CWRAF. Have done a brief blog post to highlight this:

Further the the work done in 2010 with Brenda Larcom for roadmap
charts, I have created a preliminary equivalent for a single point in
time scorecard i.e. not a comparative scorecard as included in the
SAMM document.

If anyone has time, could they have a look at the XML format, schema
and transformation? You will also need the base US English XML file
(version 0.3) for SAMM v1.0, available in a Zip archive on the SAMM
download page (SAMM-1.0-XML-0.3-en_US.xml). The attached JPG is a web
browser screenshot of the SVG image. Other files to follow.

If it seems okay, I'll do a blog post for the SAMM website.

Regards

Colin

We are currently looking to use SAMM as the basis for an assessment of the 
software security program at one of our large retail clients.  Our client 
has asked us if anyone has done any kind of benchmarking of SAMM maturity 
across various companies and industries.  If so, could you direct us to 
this?  If not, have any of the software security vendors produced anything 
that you are aware of that can be cited? 

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

The BSIMM survey has real data, and this is cross-referenced to SAMM:

http://www.opensamm.org/2011/03/bsimm-activities-mapped-to-samm/

It is not direct data, but may suffice?  If you do any analysis, it
would be good to share it here.

Joe,

Both the "Putting BSIMM3 to Use" and "BSIMM as a Longitudinal Study"
sections of BSIMM3 would be of relevance to "real world" benchmarking and
can be downloaded from http://bsimm.com/download/
