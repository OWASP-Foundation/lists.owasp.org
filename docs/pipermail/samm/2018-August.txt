Subject: [SAMM] SAMM Latin American Spanish (es-419) translation
Message-ID: <CA+J_2XBZWJDir3g+bL3B7FiXY_MtxQzU=A=_oiRLjHsxsR8-vg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My team is pushing SAMM into our organization at M?xico. It would help us
in the adoption process if SAMM was available in Spanish. We looked in the
Languages section of the project but didn't find it, neither at Github.

I will translate the 1.5 Core Model document to Spanish and would be happy
to commit it to the project or join any ongoing translation effort but the
Crowdin (http://crowdin.net/project/owasp-samm) is broken and could not
find the project.

regards

Alexis

Almost no one uses SAMM except few sponsors. It is dead.
Not sure why you bother.

Wrong! It?s being widely used. Alexis said his company is using it :)

@Alexis : Samm 2 is coming-soon. Wait a little to translate the fresh new release.

hi Al,

SAMM is certainly not dead.
We have an active community, great core team and lots of users.
It is one of the stronger tracks of the last security summits
I personally know lots of organisations that are using it

The core team is currently working hard on the next release (v2).
You can see a sneak preview here: https://owaspsamm.org/

kind regards

Seba

hi Alexis,

Thanks for your offer to translate!
The best is to work on GitHub , the latest v1.5 is available in MarkDown
here https://github.com/OWASP/samm/tree/master/v1.5/MarkDown

If you need Crowdin, let me know. I will then look to revive the account if
necessary.

Kind regards

Seba

Hi,

Thanks everybody for your help. I'll get in contact with Latin American
chapters to work on the translation.

Seba, I will look into GitHub.

Hope to talk you back soon with good news.

I'm using it. Although we are not a "major company" - we do appreciate all
the work that's been put into the framework.

Hi Carlos,

I have created the project in crowdin and uploaded version 1.5 in markdown
here:
https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-samm/settings#files

Is this good to start?

Thank you for your help!

Kind regards

Seba
