I'd second what Ian is stating in regards to keep it small and simple. I'd
maybe start at the BU or department level, its much more manageable and
working with those smaller teams should make getting a consensus on things
easier than when dealing with larger groups. From there you can branch out
to the larger organization.

Subject: [SAMM] REMINDER - for review - OWASP SAMMv1.5 (by 7-Dec-2016)
Message-ID: <CAAihoGuVCfBK1Ay1NWNw5Te=htvJAZUZLufPanPnU3uA-owrpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Do not forget the request for feedback on SAMMv1.5 -
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2016-November/000858.html
So far we have received 5 remarks, I am sure more remarks/questions can be
made. So do not be shy :-)

The team (and especially Brian) has put a lot of energy and time in
creating the next release of OWASP SAMM v1.5.

The main change is the update to the scoring system, i.e. move from binary
yes/no to the multi-tiered questions/answers of the current proposal.
The benefits:
1) shows direct improvements with every activity introduced.
2) facilitates a more accurate measurement of the activities.

The changes are listed here:
https://github.com/OWASP/samm/blob/master/v1.2/Documentation/SAMM1.2-Requirements.txt

What was intended for SAMM v1.2 was changed to v1.5 to more accurately
represent a
transition version between v1.0 and v2.0.  The scoring changes in v1.5 are
a significant
change from v1.0-1.1 and we felt they would be better suited to start now
than in v2.0.

Please use the following sheet to add your review comments/questions:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TblUSU-VbTGUgcLBIYeVHkba0HZF7EEgCQaRQnhHr1I/edit?usp=sharing

Timing: finish your review by 7-Dec-2016, this allows Brian & the team to
go through the comments by the next SAMM call on 14-Dec-2016.

Thank you,

Kind regards,

Seba

Hi,

I did not have any initial feedback when reviewing the 1.5 Toolbox a few weeks ago, but after walking through an example conversion from 1.1 to 1.5 with an internal project team, I found unexpected behavior with the Roadmap tab. I?ve added a comment to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TblUSU-VbTGUgcLBIYeVHkba0HZF7EEgCQaRQnhHr1I/edit?usp=sharing<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__docs.google.com_spreadsheets_d_1TblUSU-2DVbTGUgcLBIYeVHkba0HZF7EEgCQaRQnhHr1I_edit-3Fusp-3Dsharing&d=DgMFaQ&c=gJN2jf8AyP5Q6Np0yWY19w&r=4fF6RYTPPA7lSzHx10HK9nmMDXYgNcOCjtyx46vKPso&m=e70cJ0VsafFUc4ibj9UvjtQdBgPWWxGhzss8vCawF6Q&s=G2Y_WREL82PG7XW8m1_khvr50X0M3VVZgPuMbMMhClI&e=>

My apologies for not getting this feedback in before 12/7/16.

Thanks,

kevin
