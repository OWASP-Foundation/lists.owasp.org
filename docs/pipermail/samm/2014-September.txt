Hi Team!

Yan Kravchenko an OpenSAMM participant, asked the project Team if we were
going to host an OpenSAMM workshop. Seba and Bart will not attend.  So, I
decided to jump in and try to set something up for this upcoming OWASP
Summit

We have scheduled a workshop for the 18th and 19th. Please see the schedule
for the details - [http://2014.appsecusa.org/2014/about/schedule/]

Our goal is to complete the mapping of PCI requirements and SAMM
activities. Yan and I started working on this effort earlier this year. We
have completed a high level mapping of PCI version 3. Now we are trying to
add the details.

In addition, we would like to continue Pravir's suggestion from Hamburg's
OpenSAMM workshop, where Pravir suggested to the project team to build
cross functional flow charts (play-books), in an effort to provide guidance
on how to implement the model.

We would like to use this time to get work done.  Please join us if you are
planning to attend the conference.

Regards,

Kuai Hinojosa
