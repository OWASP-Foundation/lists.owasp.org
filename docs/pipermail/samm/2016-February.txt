Subject: [SAMM] Block your agendas - SAMM Summit on April 20-21 in New York!
 - Looking for Venue?
Message-ID: <CAAihoGvicFLNZ0t-U1m15vSRd5ZeAdksCY4d13XMaKq67yJwjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We will be organizing our yearly SAMM Summit in the Big Apple this year.

   - Dates: 20-21 April 2016
   - Location: New York, US
   - Venue: to be decided
   - Agenda: hands-on sprint on SAMM 2.0 + next steps

*First*: block your agendas!

*Secondly*: We are still looking for a venue to host/hire for the SAMM
Summit on April 20-21 in New York.

The location should preferably have 1 room of up to 40 people which can be
split in 2 or where we have an extra break-out room available.
It would be great if there is an organisation that can host this?
We do have budget to rent room(s) and cover catering in a hotel /
convention centre if necessary.

If you know of a suitable venue or your organisation can host/sponsor this,
please contact me!

Thank you!

Kind regards,

Seba

Subject: [SAMM] Flight booked for SAMM Summit in NY (20-21 April)?
Message-ID: <CAAihoGtzw-DwsLxfC83C5zxRcZYR4-qdywUsT0G=+yL+YY4a7Q@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

I just booked my flight for NY and am looking forward to see you to discuss
& work on SAMM V2 !

Now is the best time to book your flight (about 7 weeks before the flight -
http://www.skyscanner.net/bttb/best-time-to-book-uk )

We started up our 2nd Summit page here;
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Summit_2016

We are homing in on a venue in Manhattan. As soon as this is confirmed I
will update the information and add some recommended hotels nearby.

We will also have a registration link up in the coming days.

Stay tuned ...

Kind regards,

Seba
