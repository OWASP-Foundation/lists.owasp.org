<PRE>Dear samm-ers,

This is not the first time I ask myself this question, now I am facing this
situation, and wanted to share some thoughts.
By appsec out of development, I mean any running software which is not
developed; for some companies, the buy/make profile is 100% (no dev, all
acquired), some 50% but never 0% (all dev, all in-house).

Imho application security, following a samm perspective, means software
security; and as such SAMM is even more right.
However that means lots of activities are not applicable.

Now beside opensamm, from an asvs perspective, application security means
security testing (from requirements to bugs/vulnerabilities).

&gt;<i>From an esapi perspective, application security means secure development.
</I>
Application security can also mean application risk following threat
modelling / iso / cvss... etc.

The bottom line is the application's core security is in development; this
is probably why dev guide consumes and produces most of resources,
hopefully.

So I wonder how application security can exist out of development, i.e. out
of its core?

Further, we are in fact all affected, only difference is scale: even for
software companies, what about third-party software' appsec?

I will be glad to read from you soon.

Abdsamad
