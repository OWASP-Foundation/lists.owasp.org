Dennis,

 

I am not sure where you are coming from but <A HREF="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/</A>
are the best approach to implement a level of security within an
immature organisation.

 

The &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach of PCI DSS, etc doesn't work as it will
ultimately be rejected politically due to the lack of maturity within an
organisation which is the primary reason behind ISO/IEC 27003:2010 being
a CMMI implementation of an ISMS.

With all due respect Christian,

Gary has said: &quot;I hold this truth to be self evident - security is an
emergent property of the entire system, just like quality.&quot;

I hate to controdict; however, the primary assumption is that security
exists! 
Security does not exist! Security is no more an emergent property than a
pot of gold at the end of a rainbow!

Humans for example are fantasticly complex systems with a number of
systems dedicated to their security. However, numerous pathogens still
compromise the system - for example viri like aids; to name a single
example. 
Survivability aka homeostasis in a hostile envoirnment is the **very
best** we can aim for.  

Security is a unicorn, it is completely imaginary.

You should know this more than anybody Christian, since nobody can keep
you out of anything if you put your mind to it. Why? Because their is
only one way to be secure and that is control of the entire chain of
trust; which is impossible, and there are gazillions of was to be
insecure. Second, even if somebody did manage to be secure at some
moment in time, the laws of entropy would decay the trust/securue and it
would returen to insecurity.

Again, I maintain security is as imaginary as Equestria
