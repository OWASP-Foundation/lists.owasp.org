I'm definitely inclined to agree with a 1.1 version number instead of a 
2.0 since the main changes that we identified for the next version all 
consisted of minor updates or additions of newer material that was more 
descriptive. Most of those changes were listed out at the OWASP Summit 
at the beginning of the year and I've got them in my notes. Knowing that 
doesn't help anyone that wants to volunteer some effort, I set up an 
Issue Tracker on Google Code for the OpenSAMM project to make it easy 
for people to add requests or file "bugs". It's here:

http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/

Please feel free to go through any individual lists of changes that you 
have an add them, I'll do the same this week while I'm on the road and 
we can have a near complete list of to-do's for 1.1 by next week I think.

Pravir,

One thing to note FYI, in the translated versions, we've been trying to keep the abbreviated two-letter names the same as the English version and just translating the long names.

Cool. I'll add my list to the issue tracking site 
(http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/) this week, but please feel free to 
go ahead and post up any contribs/changes that you guys came across as 
you were applying it in your organizations.

So, to answer your questions:

1) All the changes will be tracked through the Google code issue tracker 
(http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/). I have a decent size list of 
changes that I still need to post up there and will do so this week. 
Others are greatly encouraged to add anything they think is relevant to 
the issue tracker (we'll go through and triage, de-duplicate, etc., so 
feel free to fire away).

2) Yes, I think I'll be the point-person on coordinating the next 
release, but I'll gladly accept anyone's help with the writing, changes, 
or any other part of the production process.

3) Yeah, I'll fix the website since the SEP as a concept is still OK, 
it's just that we're going to track it all in the Google code site as 
opposed to the more free-form wordpress page madness. Like I said, by 
end of week, I'll put up everything I know about  (and post about it 
here and/or on the opensamm.org site)

4) Issue tracker will be the main mechanism for feedback and changes 
going forward. I still like the SEP concept to ensure we have good 
justification for structural changes to the model, but all this can be 
more easily captured in the issue tracker.
