Hi seba,
glad you answered my questions!
I forked the project (https://github.com/BavariaBlue/samm) and will later invite other participants to join me changing the markdown file on GitHub.
We will work on v1.5 for now. Later, when our project matures && v2.0 is in beta/master, we will switch to v2.0.
One thing left: How do you create the final PDF from the markdown file, including the fancy (CSS) styles? Is there something like a script that automates the process?
It would be nice to join the slack channel. Could you send me an invite to johannesrottenkolber at icloud.com ?

Thanks a lot,
