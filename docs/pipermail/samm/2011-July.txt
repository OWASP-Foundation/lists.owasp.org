Hello!

I'm doing research on OpenSAMM for my bachelor's thesis and I'd like to
know if the case study of "VirtualWare" at the end of the document is
an anonymized experience report or if it is entirely fictional.

Thank you very much,
Fabian Streitel

According the presentation on OpenSAMM delivered by Justin Derry at
the AISA Sydney (Australia) Branch Meeting on 6 October 2010, he
prepared this case study and alleged that "VirtualWare" might be
"VMWare".

You might also want to consider http://bsimm.com/ which is study of
~30 real world case studies which I have summarised at

It's not based on VMWare, but interestingly, Justin Derry was the original author of the case study in SAMM :) 

When we wrote it, we were basically drawing from our individual experiences from a few different organizations where we had led the build-out of software security programs. Then, we "reverse engineered" the case study from that by putting our experience from those programs in terms of the model's levels, activities, etc.

Does that help?

Thank you both for your quick reply.

That was exactly the information I needed.

Greetings,

Would the above would be applicable to four examples after p27 within
"Building Assurance Programs"?

Yeah, same idea there, but we separated our notes into silos for those 4 
example org types and them built the roadmaps from the applicable 
companies. The case-study was ISV only.
