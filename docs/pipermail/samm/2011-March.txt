Hey Pawel.

I'm only just now getting a chance to take a look at the finished 
product, but this is very cool. And we can definitely add a little more 
structure to those front parts if it makes it easier. I just lumped them 
together at the time since I wasn't really thinking about translating 
the format (I was mostly thinking about foreign language translations).

We should create a post about it on the SAMM site... Colin, if you (or 
anyone else with posting privs) sees this and has some time, can you do 
a little post with a pointer to Pawel's work?

Thanks!
