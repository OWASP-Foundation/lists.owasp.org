Hello all,

I'm real excited about openSAMM.  I'm preparing to give a presentation 
on CLASP and would like to introduce openSAMM.  After some google-ing 
for some presentations on CLASP I found Mr. Pravir's slides from his 
presentation at OWASP NYC.  I wondering if there is a newer version of 
those slides with version 1.0 updates.  If so can I use them?

And for Mr Pravir, thank you for putting your work out in the open for 
all to use and share!  That was quite a gift.

- Cam Morris

Hey Everyone.
Sorry I've been so quiet lately, things have just been darn busy since the
1.0 was released (my inbox runneth over). Lots of interesting things afoot,
though:

 * There's now a lightweight enhancement proposal process (based *very*
loosely on the way Python manages changes to the language). Read the details
about it here: http://www.opensamm.org/2009/04/the-samm-enhancement-process/

 * As an example of an enhancement proposal, I put up a quick one about what
I'm working on now:
http://www.opensamm.org/2009/04/sep-001-extract-content-into-editable-format/

 * I've got a bunch of emails from individuals about SAMM enhancements (some
of which were sent to this list a few weeks ago). I'll be culling those from
the rest and contacting those individuals (I'll CC this list) to see if we
can get SEPs put together and work kicked off.

 * In case you missed it at the end of March, I also put up a brief note
about the major changes between the Beta release and the 1.0 release:
http://www.opensamm.org/2009/03/model-changes-between-the-beta-and-10/

I'm also doing a tutorial on SAMM at the ROOTS conference in Bergen, Norway
this week, so I'll have some updated slides and training around SAMM
available on the site by next week. Stay tuned for more.

As always, comments/questions/flames invited.

Subject: [SAMM] Mapping SAMM to other maturity models
Message-ID: <6cc3b40d0904261102s58d03c7bp565d0f7dcb15cf1e@mail.gmail.com>

I saw the previous thread between Dave Rook and Colin Watson on mapping SAMM
to other maturity models. I'm definitely interested in getting this added to
SAMM since I feel it'll add huge benefits in terms of easing adoption. I saw
several names thrown out there like ISM3, COBIT, NIST SP800-53 Rev3, ISO
27001, and even ASVS. From other emails I've received from individuals,
people have also requested mappings to things like PCI and several other US
Gov't standards. Someone has also suggested mappings to BSIMM.
What do we think here? My thought was that mapping SAMM to *anything* makes
it more useful to people that are already using that particular something.
In other words, if you want to build the mapping, we'll take it!

I envision these mappings being self-contained "companion" docs. Like "SAMM
1.0 - ISM3 Companion". I'll leave it to the first person that writes a SEP
and volunteers to build one to put together a straw-man for structure of a
companion doc. I'll, of course, volunteer to help that happen, but I don't
have the cycles to be the primary driver. Also, I'll take care of making the
look/feel consistent and doing the graphical layout.

Dave, Colin, everyone: What would you like to sign up for? Based on
volunteers, we might be able to get multiple people helping for each one.

Thanks!

Hey Cam.
Thanks for your note on the SAMM list asking about presentations and sorry I
haven't responded until now. Later this week, I'll be posting a new
presentation on SAMM 1.0 (I'm doing a conference talk this week and I'm
preparing slides for that).

Thanks!

I am actually slated to do a presentation on Open SAMM on 5/20 for my
local owasp chapter in Tampa,  I will share the presentation after I
have given it.

Perfect. I know Matt Bartoldus has also done a SAMM presentation (slides
here: http://www.owasp.org/images/d/df/OpenSAMM.pdf).
If anyone else has presentations they'd like to share, send them and I'll
post them on the OpenSAMM site.

Is anyone else interested in mapping CLASP resources to OpenSAMM and
potentially creating new resources for OpenSAMM?

I've been thinking about this one for a while, and I think there's actually
even more existing material that we can map to SAMM levels beyond those in
CLASP (the OWASP Testing Guide, Developer Guide, Code Review Guide, ASVS,
the MS SDL resources on MSDN, open source tools, etc.). Can we get
volunteers to carry the banner for one or more of these?
To do this cleanly, we probably need to create a web site that characterizes
the OpenSAMM Security Practices and associated Maturity Levels with the
ability to map individual resources to each Level (or even each Activity
under each Level to get more granular). I'm thinking this is the job of a
wiki. Maybe we can make OWASP wiki pages for each Level/Activity and allow
contributors to map the existing resources that way? Thoughts?

One of the next steps with SAMM must surely be to 'wikify and owasp
assimilate it' :-)

Yeah, I'll always be producing the polished PDF for mass distribution, but
mirroring the content on the wiki isn't a bad plan... It fits in nicely with
the plan to map in other resources.

Fortunately, OpenSAMM is organized well, and should be quick to convert to a
wiki.  Do you want to include all of the content within the pdf on the wiki
or would you rather have each objective as a page with associated resources
underneath?  I personally think that each objective should get its own page,
having the content from the pdf underneath, and resources last.

If you go through and create placeholder pages for the objectives, organized
how you see fit, then I will start adding resources for each.
