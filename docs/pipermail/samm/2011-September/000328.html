Mature organisations have UAT.

OpenSAMM is intended for all types of developers and not a specific subset.

&gt;<i> But as you said, SAMM is for in-house as well as COTS.
</I>
Therefore the &quot;activities&quot; of OpenSAMM have to be applicable to both
COTS and in-house to avoid excluding one over the other.

The problem is that you are expecting a COTS developer to test against
the nuance(s) of each customers' web server build.

80% is misleading then based on the intent of the metric that you are proposing.

As a customer you don't trust the vendor, rather an independent third party.
