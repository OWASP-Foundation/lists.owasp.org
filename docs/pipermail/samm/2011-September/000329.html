And yet it includes activities that do not fit every organization, which
is a good thing! You can't expect OpenSAMM to be the minimal common
ground between all software organizations. That would not make for a
good model, or for very secure software for that matter.
You have to include activities that only fit a subset of the
organizations as well in order to respect their differences.
Deployment may not be an issue for some
developing companies, yet OpenSAMM covers it. Compliance may not be an
issue for some other companies, yet OpenSAMM covers it. Penetration
testing may not be an issue for some companies; doesn't mean OpenSAMM
shouldn't cover it.

Same argument as above.

Alright, point taken. Maybe we should reword these lines then:

    This should preferably be done in a test environment that mimics the produc-
    tion situation as closely as possible. If there is no such environment,
    test the system in production, but ensure its safety and integrity.

And instead have something along those lines:

    This should preferrably be done in a test environment that mimics
    the production situation as closely as is possible and reasonable.
    As a rule of thumb, aim for roughly 80% compliance with the
    production environment.

How about that?

If a penetration test finds
vulnerabilities, those should probably be fixed. Whether an independant
third party found them or not is not of importance. If your customers
demand that, so be it. We don't have to prescribe anything in that
matter, though, and if you look at my wording in
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/issues/detail?id=8,">http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/issues/detail?id=8,</A> I didn't (first
sentence).

Fabian
