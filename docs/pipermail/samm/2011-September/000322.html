ASVS has produced a number of diagrams in relation to the SDL and
&quot;penetration testing&quot;,
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_bootstrap_your_SDLC_with_verification_activities">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_bootstrap_your_SDLC_with_verification_activities</A>
was the first one that I had at hand since it is directly referenced
on <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS</A>

This would require the developer to have access to their customers
live environment which might not possible with COTS - in this case

(as an example) would apply as &quot;penetration testing&quot; prior to
shipping.

OpenSAMM is related to the maturity of the developer only, not the consumer.

Furthermore, the consumer might not be able to reverse the binaries
due to license restrictions neither would they be provided (read-only)
access to the vendor's SCM to repeat the (security) unit tests, etc.

</I>
BSIMM is based on the first (public release) beta of OpenSAMM and
hence they were not constructed completely in parallel once their
respective final releases were published.
