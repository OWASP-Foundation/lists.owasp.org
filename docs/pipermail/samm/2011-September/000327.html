<PRE>Christian,

&gt;<i> I have never seen a UAT/development build reflect the production
</I>&gt;<i> build, unless the UAT is transition to production and then it is
</I>&gt;<i> rebuild (in production) somewhere in the future.
</I>
I didn't talk about UAT.

&gt;<i> All organisations do not have spare hardware to support this or
</I>&gt;<i> technical people to design the specific build (i.e. in addition to the
</I>&gt;<i> post installation) from the SOE.  Furthermore, this extends to
</I>&gt;<i> virtualised implementations.
</I>
But some do. Doesn't mean we should exclude it for that reason.

&gt;<i> This is not possible for a COTS developer as each SOE (per customer)
</I>&gt;<i> is different.
</I>
But as you said, SAMM is for in-house as well as COTS.

&gt;<i> It is only feasible if the in-house developer tests on the SOE and
</I>&gt;<i> associated the post-installation procedure for the (generic) web
</I>&gt;<i> server.
</I>
Indeed, I don't see a problem there.

&gt;<i> This has a substantial cost associated with it and it has to be
</I>&gt;<i> rebuild after each test.
</I>
As I said, as close as is reasonable. That doesn't imply 100% compliance
with the production environment, but 80% compliance can be achieved
rather easily. Most stuff is needed to get the application running in
the first place anyways.

&gt;<i> The production environment is always different to the development environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The intended outcome is flawed if you don't test the production environment.
</I>
My point exactly.

&gt;<i> As far as the consumer is concerned if they have hired external
</I>&gt;<i> auditors who found some vulnerabilities in the application then they
</I>&gt;<i> have undertaken their duty of care.
</I>
As I said, I don't want consumers to do the penetration testing, it's
the developing side that has to do it.

I think we may have gotten a little side-tracked with our discussion and
it seems a bit one-sided that only the two of us argue about it. Aren't
there any other people who have an opinion?

I'd really like some feedback on my proposed changes to ST1B:
