This is the intent of the case studies and BSIMM, which I hear on the
grapevine their next release is RSN.

That stated, the consumer wants a baseline in which to measure the
maturity of vendor x against vendor y

</I>
How are you intending to measure 80% conformance?

To reach an agreement would have to be reached on what the excluded
20% of <A HREF="http://cisecurity.org/">http://cisecurity.org/</A> is a political argument that should be
avoided if the intent is raising maturity.

You didn't consider that vulnerabilities are easier (i.e. less cost)
to fix prior to release.
