<PRE>Thanks for the clarification, Pravir.

My argument is that there are no activities in SAMM that prescribe or
allow exporative testing of an application. Coming mainly from web
applications, I can say that not all vulnerabilities can be checked for
by specifying a security or penetration test-case in advance. It is
always hard to fully specify what should happen and impossible to
specify everything that shouldn't happen.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but SAMM's penetration tests do not
allow for an explorative approach. Each test-case is predefined:
&quot;Using the set of security test cases identified for each project,
penetration testing should be conducted to evaluate the system's
performance against each case&quot;
So judging by that, the penetration tests are the security tests
specified in ST1A and were specified before the test, there is no
additional testing based on exploration of the application.

This is what I see as the difference between pen testing and security
testing: Pen testing being explorative, security testing being
&quot;prescriptive&quot; (for lack of a better word), with all the test cases
known before the test.

&gt;<i> Fabien, just some specific thoughts on what you stated: I disagree
</I>&gt;<i> that production environments are &quot;crucial&quot; to pen testing as you
</I>&gt;<i> state (based on my clarification on the term &quot;pen testing&quot; above). I
</I>
Indeed with your definition of the term, they are not. Yet it is in my
opinion preferrable to perform an explorative test on an application
that has been deployed in a situation that at least mimicks the
production environment as closely as possible, since it is an effective
tool to catch errors that only surface in the deployed application. It's
hard to test for deployment issues with a security test.

&gt;<i> also disagree that SAMM's definition does &quot;not offer room for
</I>&gt;<i> explorative searching for vulnerabilities&quot;... what in SAMM led you
</I>&gt;<i> to believe that? It seems like we may need to clarify the
</I>&gt;<i> descriptions if folks pick up this sentiment in general since it's
</I>&gt;<i> certainly not the intention.
</I>
I hope I made clear above why I think that explorative pen testing is
not allowed within ST1B.

Regards,
Fabian

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;In reply to Christian:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;The subtle difference with &quot;penetration testing&quot; in OpenSAMM is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;it is undertaken before release the vendor's environment i.e. maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;dev or UAT and is similar to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;and they are a repeatable e.g. measuring the entropy of session
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;cookies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Are you sure you posted the right link? It seems to me this document is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;specific to design review. Although parts of it could also conceivably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be applied to penetration tests.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;What you are referring to as &quot;penetration testing&quot; is once the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;software has shipped and installed within the end user's environment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This is only partly true. Being as close as possible to a production
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;environment is crucial for penetration testing, yet a test environment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;is of course preferrable to a live environment, since damage to live
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;data can always occur.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I see OpenSAMMs &quot;penetration testing&quot; as a form of security testing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;since a) it doesn't cover the problems that arise once a software is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;deployed in its live environment and b) they do not offer room for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;explorative searching for vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Seeing that BSIMM places a strong emphasis on both and that it is common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;practice to conduct such tests (at least in my experience), I find it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;strange that OpenSAMM does not mention the concept at all.
