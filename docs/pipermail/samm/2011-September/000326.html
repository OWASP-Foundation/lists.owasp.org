I have never seen a UAT/development build reflect the production
build, unless the UAT is transition to production and then it is
rebuild (in production) somewhere in the future.

All organisations do not have spare hardware to support this or
technical people to design the specific build (i.e. in addition to the
post installation) from the SOE.  Furthermore, this extends to
virtualised implementations.

This is not possible for a COTS developer as each SOE (per customer)
is different.

It is only feasible if the in-house developer tests on the SOE and
associated the post-installation procedure for the (generic) web
server.

This has a substantial cost associated with it and it has to be
rebuild after each test.

The production environment is always different to the development environment.

The intended outcome is flawed if you don't test the production environment.

ASVS (which I am not endorsing) excludes tests below the application
i.e. Operating System and network.

As far as the consumer is concerned if they have hired external
auditors who found some vulnerabilities in the application then they
have undertaken their duty of care.
