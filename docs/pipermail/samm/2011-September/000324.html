<PRE>Pravir,

I have tried so here:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/issues/detail?id=18">http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/issues/detail?id=18</A>
Any comments are greatly appreciated.

Christian,

&gt;<i> This would require the developer to have access to their customers
</I>&gt;<i> live environment which might not possible with COTS - in this case
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Microsoft-Takes-LSD-to-Test-Vista-Security/">http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Microsoft-Takes-LSD-to-Test-Vista-Security/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (as an example) would apply as &quot;penetration testing&quot; prior to
</I>&gt;<i> shipping.
</I>
Indeed that is not always possible, but the reverse is also true. SAMM
is not only useful for software vendors but also for big companies that
produce and host their own software in-house. And if that is not the
case, you can still try and simulate the environment as closely as
possible.
I see no problem with the kind of penetration testing as shown in the
link you provided.

&gt;<i> OpenSAMM is related to the maturity of the developer only, not the consumer.
</I>
I'm sorry if this was unclear, but my intention is not to have consumers
of software perform penetration tests. It's for the developing company
(which might in some cases also be the consumer) to simulate a consumer
environment as closely as possible and conduct a test there.

&gt;<i> BSIMM is based on the first (public release) beta of OpenSAMM and
</I>&gt;<i> hence they were not constructed completely in parallel once their
</I>&gt;<i> respective final releases were published.
</I>
Indeed, and I would not have you think I imply that SAMM should be 100%
equal to BSIMM. Yet it strikes me as odd that BSIMM can spend a whole
practice on the topic while SAMM only mentions it in passing.

Regards,
Fabian
