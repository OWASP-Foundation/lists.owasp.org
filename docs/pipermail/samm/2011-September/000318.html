<PRE>Just to chime in on this thread, I think there's a ton of overloaded 
terms here. The main one, &quot;penetration testing&quot;, can mean a wide variety 
of things. In my career, I've seen it used (at least) for security 
testing of software releases, certifications of production deployments, 
and even &quot;red-team&quot; style activities with specific attacker goals. In 
SAMM, we're talking about the first of those, and SAMM describes it as 
follows (per ST1B): &quot;Penetration testing cases should include both 
application-specific tests to check soundness of business logic as well 
as common vulnerability tests to check the design and implementation.&quot; 
Now, in ST1B, we also allow for various roles to be the &quot;owners&quot; of the 
pen testing activities, but we do say that security auditors should 
closely monitor it if they aren't the ones conducting the testing 
themselves. We might be able to make that more clear in the activity 
descriptions if folks feel that isn't clear as it is.

As for the comparisons to the BSIMM testing activities, I have yet to 
see a strong argument for a difference between &quot;pen testing&quot; and 
&quot;security testing&quot; that doesn't simply boil down to who's doing the 
testing or when the testing is performed. In SAMM, we do not split up 
practices or activities based on these factors. SAMM aims to capture 
*what* should be performed and leaves room for organizations to specify 
(within some reasonable bounds) the who and then when. So, describe to 
me what the difference is in terms of goals, or stated differently, what 
SAMM says organizations should be doing.

Fabien, just some specific thoughts on what you stated: I disagree that 
production environments are &quot;crucial&quot; to pen testing as you state (based 
on my clarification on the term &quot;pen testing&quot; above). I also disagree 
that SAMM's definition does &quot;not offer room for explorative searching 
for vulnerabilities&quot;... what in SAMM led you to believe that? It seems 
like we may need to clarify the descriptions if folks pick up this 
sentiment in general since it's certainly not the intention.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What you are referring to as &quot;penetration testing&quot; is once the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> software has shipped and installed within the end user's environment.
</I>&gt;<i> This is only partly true. Being as close as possible to a production
</I>&gt;<i> environment is crucial for penetration testing, yet a test environment
</I>&gt;<i> is of course preferrable to a live environment, since damage to live
</I>&gt;<i> data can always occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see OpenSAMMs &quot;penetration testing&quot; as a form of security testing,
</I>&gt;<i> since a) it doesn't cover the problems that arise once a software is
</I>&gt;<i> deployed in its live environment and b) they do not offer room for
</I>&gt;<i> explorative searching for vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seeing that BSIMM places a strong emphasis on both and that it is common
</I>&gt;<i> practice to conduct such tests (at least in my experience), I find it
</I>&gt;<i> strange that OpenSAMM does not mention the concept at all.
