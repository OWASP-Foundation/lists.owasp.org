<PRE>Hello,

In reply to Christian:

&gt;<i> &gt; The subtle difference with &quot;penetration testing&quot; in OpenSAMM is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is undertaken before release the vendor's environment i.e. maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dev or UAT and is similar to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_bootstrap_your_SDLC_with_verification_activities">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_bootstrap_your_SDLC_with_verification_activities</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and they are a repeatable e.g. measuring the entropy of session
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cookies.
</I>
Are you sure you posted the right link? It seems to me this document is
specific to design review. Although parts of it could also conceivably
be applied to penetration tests.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What you are referring to as &quot;penetration testing&quot; is once the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software has shipped and installed within the end user's environment.
</I>
This is only partly true. Being as close as possible to a production
environment is crucial for penetration testing, yet a test environment
is of course preferrable to a live environment, since damage to live
data can always occur.

I see OpenSAMMs &quot;penetration testing&quot; as a form of security testing,
since a) it doesn't cover the problems that arise once a software is
deployed in its live environment and b) they do not offer room for
explorative searching for vulnerabilities.

Seeing that BSIMM places a strong emphasis on both and that it is common
practice to conduct such tests (at least in my experience), I find it
strange that OpenSAMM does not mention the concept at all.

I do not agree because of three reasons:

1. OpenSAMM does indeed have activities that are not directly
related to the development process, especially in the Deployment
business function, e.g. &quot;Identify and deploy relevant operations
protection tools&quot;.

2. I don't think excluding operations and deployment is not desirable for a model
that adresses security, since they form the basis of a secure
application. This may be less true for some kinds of applications but is
especially true for example for web applications.

3. Penetration testing may itself not be part of the development process
in practice (though one could argue that it should be), but its results
are fed back into it, so it has some relevance for it.

Fabian Streitel
