The intent of OpenSAMM is to be applicable to both COTS and in-house.

Even an in-house development environment does not reflect their
production implementation and neither would this be accepted as an
internal recharge i.e. to reflect the production environment by
rebuilding the development implementation.

The main concern is that you expecting the developers to replicate
DNS, e-mail, etc (which is outside their expertise) or that the
application be rejected if the developer is compromised with a client
side exploit i.e. not a direct fault of the application?

This is open to exploitation if a vendor has to hire an external
auditor and they have an agreement to pay a referral fee in the case
of COTS.

A consumer would prefer

(even though it's ulterior motive is marketing).

BSIMM reflects the implementation of the top ~32 companies globally
for Software Assurance.  In my opinion BSIMM is not as low level as I
would prefer i.e fuzzing, SAST, DAST, etc but this may be due to
Cigital and Fortify being accused of an ulterior motive in selling
services.

The differences between BSIMM and OpenSAMM for this specific Security
Practice have been documented by Privar and Brian Chess within
