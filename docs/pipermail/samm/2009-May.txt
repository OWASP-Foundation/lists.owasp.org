Ok, I spent some time over the weekend getting the bulk of the SAMM content
posted and organized on the OWASP wiki. Check it out here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM#tab=Browse_Online

Wyatt: I added a little heading for "Additional Information" to the bottom
of each objective's page, so you should be able to put references to
anything else underneath that section. Give it a shot and let me know if you
need anything more from me.

Thanks.

You did an excellent job.  I added a coding review checklist to
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Code_Review_-_1.  I think we are going
to need many new resources.  I will work on creating new documents, starting
at level 1.

I recently completed a
lightweight organizational assessment, using SAMM?s assessment worksheets.
Completing the assessment was straightforward. I didn?t have problems
understanding what was being asked or why; although there were a few questions
for some Level 3 practices that were targeted to enterprise-level concerns
(costing, central control, some of the auditing requirements, metrics) that I
did not go into much, working from a small company perspective. Ok, I did have to look up "Likert" to verify what the metric ">3.0 Likert on usefulness of code review activities..." was measuring in CR1.
The assessment guided
me in a structured way through a review of our application security assurance
program, what we are doing well, where we need to invest more. Going through
the assessment was also a good way to improve my understanding of the SAMM
model, the practice areas and maturity ladder.

The findings
from the assessment were generally in line with what we had already identified
through our ad hoc internal analysis and our existing roadmap, at least in the
areas of Construction and Verification practices.

I like that
SAMM considers more than Construction and Verification, that it also addresses
Governance (including training) in a simple and practical way (at least for
level 1 and 2), as well as Deployment practices (vulnerability management,
environment hardening, operational enablement), so I was able to take into
account at least some of the requirements of operations without having to put
on a different hat (ITIL, Visible Ops, SANS, and so on.). This should help
teams work on the boundaries where software assurance ends and secure
infrastructure management and operations begins, rather than throwing the
problem over the fence to operations / your customer to take care of.

I also like
that Vulnerability Management is considered an important part of the software
assurance model. It makes sense to me that a consistent mechanism should be put
into place for handling security risks, vulnerabilities and incidents, including
incident management and root cause analysis, within the software development /
project team structure; aligning this with what is done for secure deployment
and operations of the system, and within the larger context of business risk management.

Using the
assessment as a planning tool was also simple: building the assessment score
card from the worksheets; identifying gaps and areas for development, and then
referring to the roadmaps for examples, ideas where to prioritize effort. The sample
roadmaps provided good coverage, at least for my purposes (building software
for financial services customers). There are some good guidelines on handling outsourced
scenarios in the roadmaps. It would be helpful if there were also guidelines on
how to apply SAMM to agile development, for teams that follow lighter-weight
methods and practices, maybe as part of the ISV roadmap. The case study example
was also helpful.

The next
challenge is hunting down resources from all of the good stuff available from OWASP
to support improvement activities. I am happy to see that work has started to
make this easier. I can see that there will
be some interesting challenges in this. For example, Threat Assessment: SAMM TA1
recommends attack trees as a less formal alternative to STRIDE, Trike, etc.,
and provides a brief description of attack trees. Now I can google ?attack
trees? and find some helpful information out there in the wide world. But there is not much available in
OWASP itself on attack trees, except for a note from some poor guy unsuccessfully
searching for information on attack trees in CLASP at one time, and a thread in
2007 where Dinis Cruz said that Microsoft gave up on using attack trees in
threat modelling because of complexity and difficulty reading them. Whoa pardner,
this isn?t what I was hoping to find :-( 

One of the
keys to me, as a software development guy, not a security expert, is that I need clear and actionable guidance where possible. I have a lot of work to do. I really don?t want to get in the middle of the semantic war around Microsoft?s definition of Threat
Modelling vs what other security experts define as Threat Modelling. And then
there?s Attack Models and Architectural Risk Analysis (which don?t show up in
SAMM, as far as I can see ? indexing SAMM would help! - but of course are key
to BSIMM). Mapping resources from OWASP to SAMM practices in a consistent way will make a hard job,
building secure software, much easier :-)/Jim Bird

Message-ID: <290773.37223.qm@web34508.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Hi all,

During the last OWASP chapter meeting in London, Dinis tossed out the idea of using SAMM to evaluate OWASP as an organization.  I'd like to pursue this with the OWASP board, and look to pilot SAMM with a couple OWASP projects over the next few months.  In reality, I guess it will be a combination of assessing OWASP from the top down, and using a couple projects to provide some sort of meaningful score cards.
 
After some light conversation with Pravir, he suggested raising the topic on this list and I'm currently looking for a couple other interested parties to help with the idea.
 
I believe OWASP would present some interesting challenges that any large organization might face (distributed development teams, varying levels of maturity across projects, non-standard approach to using tools, etc).  I think the goal should be to develop an additional documented case study and feed back any learning lessons into the SAMM project.  Additionally, if the pilot is successful, we can help OWASP begin measuring their own maturity and developing a software security roadmap to ensure all projects are achieving a high standard of care.
 
I am happy to lead the effort, but I'd like to find at least 1 or 2 others to actively contribute.
 
Anyone interested?
 
Thanks,
Nathan

Hi Nathan,

I'd be interested in helping with that. I have a CISA exam in June so 
I'm free any time after mid-June.

Hey Jim.
This is a great post with feedback that we can use to further refine our
direction. Unless you have an objection, I'd like to write up post for the
OpenSAMM site highlighting your posts.

For some specifics, the comment on a guide for agile development teams is a
good one. I think we can use an article on applying SAMM to agile models.
It's a topic I've discussed pretty intensely at conferences with folks like
Bart De Win and Johan Peeters, and the conclusions have been generally
positive (there's nothing about SAMM that prevents its use on agile teams).
That being said we can always use clarifying articles that help make it more
concrete. Any takers? (Bart... I'm looking at you ;)

Also, for attack trees. This was the topic of hot debate after the Beta
release of SAMM, so the 1.0 is more inclusive of other methods. My take on
this is that even though attack trees can be a bit unwieldy in graphical
form, breaking them down into outlines certainly works (I've done it before
and still use them on assessment engagements). The part I like about them is
that they compose very well and are setup for reuse (once you've built the
attack tree for a type of attack, you can always attach that whole branch
elsewhere). But I'm sure others have thoughts on this too, and I'd love to
hear them.

One on the reasons (in my understanding) that MS moved away from them is
that they were forging their Threat Modeling process which has a much larger
definition in their terminology (something like what I refer to as risk
analysis). In SAMM, the Threat Assessment practice is focused on
understanding the attackers (threat agents in some nomenclatures) and their
capabilities in relation to the business risks.

Hey Guys.
I like the idea. What's next for moving it forward? We can always setup a
quick call for the team... So far I have:
 * Nathan Green
 * David Rook

Anyone else interested in getting onboard before we start planning?

All good questions. I think most of that is up for discussion still (I have some ideas, but nothing written in stone yet).

Let's make this the agenda for the planning call. If that sounds ok to you, join us for that and we'll take it from there.

Pravir & Nathan,

I may be interested as well.  I'd like to get a better idea of how this
effort will proceed, what the milestones are, and deadlines before I commit.

I'm in for the call - unless schedule conflicts - I would
like to contribute, haven't defined how, but I'm doing lots

I'm interested. It might make sense to look at a smaller part of OWASP first rather than trying to tackle the whole distributed organization. I'll volunteer the ESAPI project (and all the language-specific subprojects) as a guinea pig, so long as we get a chance to address the findings before we publish anything.

Hi Pravir, 

Please feel free to use the information from my post on the OpenSAMM site - my only restriction is that my company name cannot be referenced.
?
Mapping OWASP resources to SAMM will definitely be useful to the community. OWASP provides excellent tools and frameworks and information, but it can sometimes be a challenge to navigate the resources, and it varies in quality and completeness. Let's stay with threat modeling as an example. The best resource I have found at the OWASP site on threat modeling is

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling

I found the information here well written and easy to follow, although there seemed to be a small amount missing: "To apply STRIDE to the data flow diagram items the following table can be used: TABLE [unfortunately, there isn't one]"?
There are other references to Threat Modeling, for example "Threat Risk Modeling" which are not as comprehensive or complete, it's not clear to me why they are also included on the site - why not consolidate the information on Threat Modeling in one place and make sure it is as comprehensive and accurate as possible?

Regardless, mapping resources from OWASP to the SAMM framework will help the community both with understanding and applying SAMM as well as understanding and applying the broader value of? OWASP's resources. 
/Jim

I'm interested. It might make sense to look at a smaller part of OWASP first rather than trying to tackle the whole distributed organization. I'll volunteer the ESAPI project (and all the language-specific subprojects) as a guinea pig, so long as we get a chance to address the findings before we publish anything.

Subject: [SAMM] OpenSAMM tool
Message-ID: <046A80FB-8592-4287-9B77-704691930067@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

Now that the model is quite stable and people are starting using it  
for real, we definitely need to put together a tool to support  
assessements, roadmap creation and other SAMM related activities.

Ideally, this tool could aim initially "just" supporting enterprises  
in understanding the model, doing self-assessment, establishing a  
roadmap, creating nice reports and charts.

After this first stage, I'd like to give to the tool the ability to  
assist enterprises in actually implementing the security practices.
An already existing tool that goes in that direction is the Microsoft  
Threat Modeling Tool but it's closed sourced, not extensible and  
definitely not built around SAMM!

I'd like to brainstorm a bit with the SAMM community and of course  
find contributors to help ;)
Anyone here interested?

Cheers,
Claudio

For road mapping, I was thinking of something extremely simple.  Two forms
that work together to generate a road map.  The first step would be to take
the self assessment.  The next step in the process would show you the next
maturity levels that are available after the assessment.  For example, if
your organization is level 1 for Code Review, then on step 2 it would show
the option for level 2 for Code Review.  On step 2 you could check which
categories and levels you plan to accomplish in the next iteration.  The
result would be a formatted page for the next iteration with the items you
plan to accomplish.

I'd start with some simple spreadsheets for the reporting of assessment and
to create roadmaps with graphics
