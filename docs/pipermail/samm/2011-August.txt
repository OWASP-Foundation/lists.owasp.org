Hello Pravir

You mentioned there were some items that needed to be completed to
release the next version of SAMM.  What help do you need?

I was wondering if SAMM 1.1" might be better than "SAMM 2.0" for these reasons:

- it shows that this isn't a huge change
- it indicates that 1.0 was "near prefect" the first time
- we avoid the version number arms race
- means we don't have to worry about getting to silly numbers like v25
in the near future

but would be interested to hear other people's views on this list.

Colin

Colin,

This would be depend on how to differentiate with http://bsimm.com/ i.e. BSIMM2

Another consideration would be if any *new* "Business Functions" or
"Security Practices" that are added in the next release are backwards
compatible with v1.0.

Hello list,

I've been following the discussion about SAMM 1.1 vs. SAMM 2.0 and I was
wondering:

1.  is there a list of changes for that new version and if so, where
    could I view them?
2.  who is responsible for managing the change process? I guess Mr.
    Chandra?
3.  since there is only one SEP on the website, are the changes stored
    somewhere else?
4.  are the SEPs actually being used or has that concept been abandoned?

Best wishes,
Fabian Streitel

I have also created a secure development cycle at Rackspace over the last
couple of months heavily based on OpenSAMM and I would definitely like to
see the proposed changes and see if I can help out.

Hi all,

Here in att a french translation effort begun some time ago, and below its
progress (v0.2) :

<SAMM>
<business-functions/> 100% (4/4)
 <security-practices/> 50% (6/12)
<section id="front-matter"/> 0%
 <section id="executive summary" /> 0%
<section-split id="understanding-the-model" /> 0%
 <section id="business-functions" /> 0%
<section-split id="applying-the-model" /> 0%
 <section id="using-maturity" /> 0%
<section id="conducting assessments" /> 0%
 <section id="creating-scorecards" /> 0%
<section id="building-programs" /> 0%
 <section id="roadmap-*" /> 0%
<section-split id="security-practices" /> 0%
 <section-split id="case-studies" /> 0%
<misc-text /> 0%
 <level-data /> 100%
</SAMM>

For element <security-practices/>, following child element is sometimes not
translated : level/activities/activity/content.

Elements are deliberately fully detailed for questioning the translation
effort:
 - to focus <=> which sections need major efforts?
 - to share <=> which sections to whom?

If you find it relevant, we can make it a shared spreadsheet ? (section |
progress % | importance | who)

Translation comments are welcome in the XML file; please refer to NOTES
section for some guideline.

Hope this helps!

I have started the lodge the differences with BSIMM to
http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/issues/list for the ?Education and
Guidance? Security Practice of OpenSAMM based on
http://cmlh.id.au/post/1501070970/bsammbo-gov-training

Can you let me know if there is enough or too little information so I
can add the others listed within http://cmlh.id.au/tagged/bsammbo?

Also, what is the date when this process will close and the next
release is prepared?

In relation to thread on incorporating the supply chain into OpenSAMM

I would like to draw your attention to
http://blogs.oracle.com/maryanndavidson/entry/those_who_can_t_do,

1. Common Criteria vs SAST
2. The disclosure of IP to

3. External Audit vs Internal Audit

I will add this to http://code.google.com/p/opensamm/issues/list for

lot of (sometimes confusing) information to take in - I recommend
multiple readings :)

Wow,I didn't read all of Mary Ann's post, but from the parts I read, 
seems like a decent rant. Go ahead and add something about Supply Chain 
to the issue tracker since it definitely has come up before and we 
didn't explicitly decide on how SAMM should address that space. My 
general feeling is that endorsing some kind of test isn't the right 
approach. Rather, I like what Colin proposed a while back which was to 
pick an assurance level (i.e. a vector of scores across the 12 SAMM 
practices) and ask your vendors to comply and produce some evidence of that.
