Subject: [SAMM] Roadmap graphs
Message-ID: <20e23d920906050114p150812dav96afbbd532a7388@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I have recently started using OpenSAMM for an assessment in work. I have
searched the archive and noticed the following post, which seems like a
great idea to me:

https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2009-May/000033.html

Has anything further progessed with this?

I am now at the stage where I am preparing graphs of my findings. Excel does
a reasonable job of creating the scorecard graphs, but I am struggling to
figure out how to do nice roadmap graphs like those in the SAMM manual. Can
roadmap graphs be done in Excel too? If so, how? If not, I'd appreciate any
recommendations!

Thanks,

Aidan

I was going to give this a go in Excel and Visio, but haven't found
the time yet.

Yeah, I was playing about with both Excel and Visio myself too.

Excel does area charts, but they're not quite the right thing for roadmaps
(unless I'm missing how to tweak them).

They could be hacked together in Visio (Photoshop, etc!) but they wouldn't
be very reuseable.

I like the way when you do the scorecards in Excel, you can simply change
the values of the maturity levels and the graphs will automatically update.
If we could do that with roadmaps, it would be nice...

I could try to develop something next week.

Is it possible to see your Excel scorecard version file as a startingb
point?  Maybe we could try to produce some template resources for the
OWASP/SAMM site?

Hey Colin,

Sure, no problem. I've attached the very rough Excel sheet that I was
playing with. It could do with a bit of pimping, but the bones of the
scorecard is there.

For the roadmap tab, I was thinking multiple values would be necessary for
the different phases but I couldn't quite figure out how to get a nice
automatically generated graph to look similar to the ones in the SAMM
manual. I might have more time next week to play around with it further...

Does anyone know how the ones in the manual were created? I presume they
weren't all individually created manually and that there must be some tool
to do it?

Message-ID: <4A2C25B6.8000802@gmail.com>

There are several of us who may use SAMM to evaluate projects produced
by OWASP organization in the near future.  As part of that effort, I
created a SAMM Interview Template.  This template uses the original SAMM
self-assessment questions as a base, but expands on these items to
include detailed assertions providing further validation of software
security activities or processes.

Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

The template can be found on the following page:

Thanks!

Hey Aiden.

The roadmap graphs in the SAMM doc were actually created with Adobe
Illustrator. It has some built-in graphing ability which I use to make
the 12 individual area charts, but the rest of the charts (namely the
gray overlays for each phase) is handled through layers. I'll be the
first to admit that it isn't exactly the easiest to work with, but it
does produce nice looking charts.

Does anyone know of drawing tools that could replace this? I haven't
found one in all my searches (and I needed a good excuse to learn
Illustrator when I was laying out the SAMM doc). Excel *might* be able
to do this, but I'm no Excel wizard, so I'm not sure.

p.

Cheers Pravir,

For the sake of my current engagement, I'll hack something together in a
graphics editing tool because I need to get the images quickly :-)

However, I hope to look into further ways of automating the generation of
these graphs. It really shouldn't be too difficult to write a server-side
script to generate HTML roadmaps - it's just a case of finding the time!

Also, as a result of the current engagement, my colleagues and I will have
some feedback to provide you with and we'll be in touch in the coming weeks
once we wrap up and pull our thoughts together. We've found SAMM very useful
and hope to provide some further suggestions based on our experience with
it.

Talk to you in the coming weeks...

Aidan

I've had some success in Excel - screen capture attached.  It does
update dynamically, but is a bit sensitive to modification due to the
use of some background images.

I'll work it up a bit more tomorrow,

Anyone writing code may want to look at GraphViz  
(http://www.graphviz.org/).  It does a great job generating a graph  
either from the command line or from another programming language.  At  
least it did when I used it a few years ago.  :)

I've uploaded my draft XLS spreadsheet:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:Samm-roadmap-chart-template.xls

I couldn't do the same in OpenOffice Calc unfortunately.  Since you
prompted me to getting round to this, and I'm hoping you'll provide
some feedback, I've tentatively added you as a contributor on the
list.  Let me know if you want this removed, or more information
added.

I have also included a cover sheet wuith similar content as Nick put
on his Interview template:

http://nickcoblentz.blogspot.com/2009/06/samm-inteview-template-version-10.html

and some notes.

Title
Mapping SAMM 1.0 to NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3

-------------------

Description
Develop a companion document that maps SAMM 1.0 security practices,
objectives and activities to NIST
SP 800-53 Rev 3 (Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations).  The latter is in final draft and is due
for finalisation on 1 July 2009.  Will need to review how other
organisations have mapped standards (e.g. ISACA/COBIT) to determine
how to express partial relationships.

Hi Colin,

Looks good! I've been in a rush all week because I'm away on business but I
hope to take a proper look at this when I get home - I ended up hacking one
together with the drawing tools in Word in the end so it's nice to have a
more reusable alternative for the next assessment.

Will forward on more detailed feedback about the spreadsheet and my
experiences with SAMM in general when I get home next week.

Cheers,

Aidan

Hi Folks,

I thougt it might help some people get started with SAMM in some
organizations if they had an MS Project file with all the SAMM tasks,
rolled up to the various sections, so I made one. I added a calculated
column that shows a maturity score for each individual task and each
summary task based on the maturity level of a task and the %complete of
that task.  Sometimes it's easier to get efforts started, especially in
large organizations, if you present the effort in formats that project
management people are used to. The .mpp project file and notes are in
the OWASP file upload archive at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Special:ImageList; SAMMProject.zip.  Let
me know if you have any questions, comments, suggestions etc.

In-Reply-To: <C66EA1B4.6CC4%stacy@safecode.org>

All,

I wanted to let you know that the Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in
Code (SAFECode) will be accepting comments on its paper, "Fundamental
Practices for Secure Software Development: A Guide to the Most Effective
Secure Development Practices in Use Today," through the end of July.

As background, SAFECode originally released this paper in October 2008.  It
outlines a core set of secure development practices that can be applied
across diverse development environments to improve software security and is
based on an analysis of the individual software assurance efforts of
SAFECode members.
 
The brief paper describes each identified security practice across the
software development lifecycle ? Requirements, Design, Programming, Testing,
Code Handling and Documentation ? and offers implementation advice based on
the experiences of SAFECode members.

SAFECode will be releasing an updated version of the paper in late 2009, and
in an effort to make the paper?s recommendations as useful and relevant as
possible, we are offering experts outside of our membership an opportunity
to provide input into the paper?s next version. If you would like to review
the paper and/or submit comments, please visit:
http://www.safecode.org/feedback.php

We will be accepting comments until July 31, 2009.

Thanks,
Stacy Simpson
