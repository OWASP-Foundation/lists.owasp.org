EG3 and PC3 are considered "Related Levels" i.e. p45 EG3 is related to
"Policy & Compliance - 2 & 3" and p41 PC3 is related to "Education &
Guidance - 3"

I believe the reason as they are listed as different "Security
Practices" is that conformance to a regulatory authority (e.g. PCI
DSS, SOX, etc) is not required by every organization.

Subject: [SAMM] SAMM model - Fixing phase
Message-ID: <4D347E10.5010908@mindedsecurity.com>

Hi,
just to inform the Community that I did a presentation of SAMM at the
last OWASP Day for the e-Government in Italy.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Italy_OWASP_Day_E-Gov_10
http://www.owasp.org/images/f/fa/02_Meucci_OWASP_Day_PA_2010.pdf

Thanks to the community and a special thank to Colin for the great support!

Maybe we can add it on the SAMM site?

Then, I did a "SAMM assessment" for a Company here in Italy and I'd like
to discuss a new item that maybe we can add to the list of the Security
Practices or maybe improve the VulnMng practice.

I see many Companies that do Security Testing but not fixing at all, or
some basic fix, but they have a security response team to manage
vulnerabilities after an attack. IMO the fixing phase before that the
app is deployed is really important to evaluate the maturity of the
sw-dev-proc.
We analize that in the Vulnerability Management practice, but in the
model we did not focus on how the Company create a fixing phase after a
Code Review or Penetration Test. Reporting this is interesting to
evaluate the efficient of an outsourcer: the time they spent to fix a
bug and how they fix it is interesting for the SAMM model.

What do you think about that?

Thanks,
Mat

Several thoughts:

1. Even OWASP believes it is OK to not always fix. As long as they are taking a risk-based approach (e.g. OWASP Risk Rating Method) and they are prioritizing for future releases then I think it is OK

2. I think fixing prior to production is noble but not always practical. We all know that testing occurs so late in the lifecycle where the answer isn't to just test earlier. The challenge here is in measuring the release management approach whereby there is sufficient time between the developer writing the last line of code to the time it is released. In most shops, this window is minimized and until you address this challenge, you can't do as quickly. Even the Agile crowd, wants releases to occur where this window is minimized, the key though is that they also believe in more frequent releases.

3. Since you mentioned the word "outsourcer", maybe a measure of maturity is in understanding what measures of code acceptance your client had in place from a contract perspective. If an outsourcer isn't held to writing secure code in the first place then having a fixing phase won't matter. Is remediation done on a time and materials basis where budget pressures cause it to be moved to later?

4. I think this also calls out another challenge. If you look at any project management guidance whether PMI, Kanban, etc, there is no ability to define a fixing phase since it can't be proactively estimated. Remember in waterfall shops, they estimate everything before they even write a single line of code :-(

I think this is critical new phase. Would love to see it added...

This is also addressed by BSIMM2 i.e. PT1.2 "Feed results to defect
management and mitigation system"

The intented "executive" audience for a maturity model would not want
to be drawn into the low level detail i.e. politics of "security" bugs
vs other bugs e.g.
http://www.qasec.com/2011/01/tips-for-tracking-security-related-defects-in-your-bugtracker.html
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/706950

Measuring the timeline is more subjective due to politics e.g.
http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2011/01/announcing-crossfuzz-potential-0-day-in.html

Subject: [SAMM] SAMM in ebook formats
Message-ID: <20110126164600.A622032A761@smtp.hushmail.com>

Hi all,

As we discussed back in December, I've started to work on 
converting SAMM into document formats that would be readable on 
ebook reader devices. I've written a Python script to convert SAMM 
XML file into a set of source files (HTML, OPF, NCX) that can be 
converted into any ebook format.

The actual conversion is currently left to the user - i.e. myself 
as Kindle user I'm running mobigen.exe to convert the source files 
into MOBI file. It should be similiar in case of EPUB and other 
formats.

These files are now available here:

http://ipsec.pl/node/967

Please test & comment. 

One comment I have on the SAMM XML file is that it would help a lot 
if front-matter section was structured - i.e. authors, license, url 
etc were all listed in separate XML branches. Currently they're 
dumped in one big content section which makes extraction of this 
data a bit of guess game.

Future work would probably be mostly manual - embedding some of the 
pictures from PDF into the ebook version and improving readability 
of some sections.
