<PRE>Hi Christian. The ASD STIG spans code, documentation, and lifecycle activities. Am suggesting a tailored extension to the OpenSAMM framework to assist dev teams attempting to make preparations to meet ASD STIG requirements by serving as a tailored handbook. Am perhaps incidentially providing an example of how OpenSAMM could be tailored for a given organization. The use case is a dev team is building something and it is subject to the ASD STIG among other STIGs, so they need to make deliberate preparations to comply, and such preparations can be explained in (closer to) plain english and for example teams can be organized according to OpenSAMM's taxonomy of business functions and activities, since the ASD STIG is otherwise an unsorted crazy quilt of different types of requirements, and dev teams subject to STIG requirements otherwise generally approach compliance as a panicked and unstructured exercise. I'm aware of all the various references. Such an extension certainly could/should be tied back to other OWASP solutions and also COTS and GOTS tools.

Mike,

I briefly reviewed the DISA &#8216;s Application Security and Development
STIG  and it would appear to be more applicable to ASVS (i.e.
controls) rather then OpenSAMM (i.e. maturity).  In your opinion, is
there something missing from OpenSAMM that is included in DISA&#8216;s
Application Security and Development STIG from a maturity perspective?

OpenSAMM is intended audience is any organisation regardless of their
size and/or market vertical, i.e. not just but including the US DoD.
I have started to &quot;bridge&quot; various webappsec governance frameworks
into the ISMS (i.e. ISO 2700x) for the NSW State Government which I
believe is what you are proposing for the US DoD?

Do you have a URL for the presentation for
