<PRE>Hi,

I would like to suggest the following enhancement to extend OpenSAMM to adapt it for use by US DoD custom app developers who have very specific application security compliance requirements:

Just as there are e.g. SM1, SM2, SM3 which are generic in nature for each business function, I would like to suggest the addition of e.g. SM1, SM2, SM3, SM-DoD; PC1, PC2, PC3, PC-DoD; EG1, EG2, EG3, EG-DoD; and so on, spanning OpenSAMM, where the additional component is specific to DISA 's Application Security and Development STIG requirements.

The &quot;Results&quot; list then contains mapped functionality/docs/activities; the &quot;Add'l Success Metrics&quot; list then contains corresponding CAT severity of mapped functionality/docs/activities; costs and personnel stay the same, perhaps ideally replaced with Gov't-speak versions of terminology/roles. Perhaps add an additional &quot;Prescribed Solutions&quot; under &quot;Personnel&quot; before &quot;Related Levels&quot;, that would do things like say use NIST validated this, NSA allowed that, use DoD PKI, etc.

The idea would be that one could then use OpenSAMM as supporting material to help guide a dev team through make preparations to comply with DISA 's Application Security and Development STIG.

Best,

Mike B.
