<PRE>Now this is very interesting food for thought, James. Though, it's probably a separate conversation from what Mike is after.

My first question when it comes to documentation maturity is: Does this belong in a framework promoting software security assurance, or is this something covered by other maturity models that are focused on improving sw dev itself. From your points below, I can certainly see some justification for either answer. The tricky part about something like SAMM, tho, is that ideally, *all* the practices in SAMM would just be part of normal dev lifecycle models. But the world's not ideal, so we write down &quot;security stuff&quot; separately from &quot;normal stuff&quot; but the line is fuzzy. 

We tried not to cross the fuzzy line with SAMM 1.0 so that we didn't get into conflicts with any existing dev process models, thus keeping the audience as broad as it could be (i.e. anyone building software). I fear treading into doc maturity too far may overstep this project's &quot;security&quot; flavor, but I'm definitely for tying in activities or language that prevent doc-related vulnerabilities or compromised specs. Just not sure how we'd reasonably tell people to prevent those things :)

Just my $0.02.

&gt;<i> More thoughts on documentation maturity:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We need to acknowledge that low quality or missing documentation is the major cause of errors in software. We should noodle the implications of documentation handed to developers by business analysts before software is written and documentation that is turned over to operations folks by developers. The former could lead to business logic flaws while the later could lead to mis-configuration. At the process level, can a team skip producing documentation because they are jammed and still be considered mature according to SAMM?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I do believe that in order to have a consistent security posture, you need to document software consistently throughout the lifecycle. Templates for how BA's capture requirements with a taxonomy of business requirements traceable to technical requirements traceable to system requirements is a good thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. What happens when code gets out of sync from documentation? Could users introduce other unintended system behaviors especially in the more popular paradigm of meta-data driven applications that change the security model?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Should documentation be version-controlled at the same level as code or is it OK to throw it up on SharePoint?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. In our throw it over the wall outsourcing culture. What would happen if James McGovern of The Hartford decided to introduce a backdoor as a specification into an application he wasn't authorized to work on. I can tell you that it would seamlessly flow thru the process and even get tested for whether it actually worked :-)
