<PRE>Mike,

I briefly reviewed the DISA &#8216;s Application Security and Development
STIG  and it would appear to be more applicable to ASVS (i.e.
controls) rather then OpenSAMM (i.e. maturity).  In your opinion, is
there something missing from OpenSAMM that is included in DISA&#8216;s
Application Security and Development STIG from a maturity perspective?

OpenSAMM is intended audience is any organisation regardless of their
size and/or market vertical, i.e. not just but including the US DoD.
I have started to &quot;bridge&quot; various webappsec governance frameworks
into the ISMS (i.e. ISO 2700x) for the NSW State Government which I
believe is what you are proposing for the US DoD?

Do you have a URL for the presentation for
