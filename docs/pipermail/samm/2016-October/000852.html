<PRE>Hi Mike,

thanks for your answer (I saw it in the digest).

&gt;<i> Interesting question. As far as I know: NOT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the strengths imho of OWASP and this great SAMM project is that
</I>it is open for all.  So open to:
&gt;<i> - use and  improve without borders.
</I>
&gt;<i> I think that companies that have implemented SAMM (with or without help)
</I>&gt;<i> should receive some kind of recognition. But not the ISO-way, but far
</I>&gt;<i> more open and inline with OWASP philosophy. Maybe something like an open
</I>&gt;<i> badge certification is something considering for the next-release. With
</I>&gt;<i> this I mean:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) something companies can show that they have implemented SAMM (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> logo on site , see e.g. how the CII program has handled this:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/&lt;https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/">https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/&lt;https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/</A>&gt; ) This gives credit to the
</I>&gt;<i> company and their customers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Some open transparent defined process proves that companies showing
</I>&gt;<i> the badge really earn the badge (or SAMM approved logo -). This can also
</I>&gt;<i> give SAMM and companies using it a boost.
</I>
I like this proposal, I agree the ISO way is not the best for SAMM, but it would certainly be good to have both of the above.  It's a nice way of being able to prove one has undertaken the steps to implement SAMM.

To ask a different question - has anyone used SAMM as a basis for gaining another accreditation/certification?

The reason behind this is to give some badge/proof to customers that we create cyber secure solutions, and have followed a well defined model in doing so.

Subject: OWAP SAMM Accreditation/Certification

Hi all,

I'm working with my company to implement SAMM as I seek to build a Cyber Security capability at my local office.

One thing that I am interested in is if there is Accreditation/Certification available for offices/organisations who implement OWASP SAMM security practices?

We've been successful in achieving ISO:9001 and ISO:27001 however we view OWASP SAMM as an important next step for us.

Thanks,
