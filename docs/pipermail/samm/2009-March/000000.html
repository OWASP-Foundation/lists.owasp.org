<PRE>Hi everyone,

I'd like to say that I was very impressed by the work produced here 
guys, nice job Pravir (I'm pretty sure we talked at the OWASP EU Summit 
in November actually about your black Macbook!).

I posted a comment on the website about mapping the SAMM maturity levels 
to those of common frameworks such as COBIT. The IT part of my business 
uses COBIT whilst security uses ISM3 from an operational security 
standpoint and now SAMM for app sec. The useful thing about the ISM3 is 
the maturity levels are already mapped to COBIT making it easy for me to 
use it for security and still deliver a COBIT score to IT. I would like 
to do the same for SAMM, in fact I will have to do it internally anyway 
if I want to use it so I wondered if this is something that you feel 
would be useful to add to the SAMM project?

Dave
