<PRE>Traditionally, articles have approached this subject more from the
perspective of the reader wanting to do something about security within
their own context. For an industry rag, I think the question changes
slightly to how can I measure the security of others. Consider the
scenario of an independent insurance agent who has a fidicuary duty to
protect their customer's data. If they wanted to get a competitive quote
for insurance on behalf of their customer (say Pravir) what should they
ask The Hartford, Traveler's, Geico, AIG, etc about their application
security in terms of maturity?

That's a good question, really. First thought is to immediately jump to
a conversation about risks and unknowns vs. knowns, etc. BUT, I think
based on experience, most are generally WAY more basic than that when it
comes to appsec (at least when they're getting a program off the ground
all the way up until we'd anecdotally say a company &quot;has an appsec
program&quot;). In those stages the questions are more like (roughly in
order, tho some oscillation):
 * Is this really a (potential) problem? Usually an easily evinced
point.
 * Am I doing anything about it right now?
 * Is what I'm doing good enough or should I be trying to change things?
 * How do we measure any of this madness since I need to manage it?

Dunno if that helps, just my $0.02 while in between flights. Glad to
help further if you want to collaborate on the article.
