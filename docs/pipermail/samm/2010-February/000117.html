<PRE>I like your take. Maybe the SAMM team could provide formal commentary to
NIST in this regard. I suspect that in not providing feedback, it will
be published and those who read it at a later date will get confused as
to the value proposition of each aka more disturbances in the force...

James,

 

I'm not familiar (yet) with the details of SP800-37.

 

However, to add another NIST SP document to this discussion, SP 800-64
(R2 of October 2008) is definitely also worth looking at in the secure
development lifecycle context. Imho, from a bird's eye view, the main
differences between SP 800-64 and SAMM/BSIMM are:

-          The NIST model is a process model, while SAMM and BSIMM are
maturity models. This is a fundamentally different. In that sense, it is
more related to the SDL/CLASP/TouchPoint type of models.

-          In the same line of reasoning, the NIST model is
waterfall-based, while SAMM and BSIMM are actually process agnostic
(they can be applied to waterfall, agile and other types of processes)

-          NIST SP 800-64 focuses much more on deployment, operations
and disposal than any of the other models that I've seen so far.

 

I'd be also interested in hearing any other opinions about this one.

 

Best regards,

Bart.

NIST has created a draft document entitled: Guide for applying risk
management framework to federal information systems: a security
lifecycle approach. Curious to know if anyone has identified gaps,
differences in opinion, etc between NIST and how either SAMM or BSIMM
would define the same?
