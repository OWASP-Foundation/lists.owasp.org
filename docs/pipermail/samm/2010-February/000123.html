<PRE>That's a good question, really. First thought is to immediately jump
to a conversation about risks and unknowns vs. knowns, etc. BUT, I
think based on experience, most are generally WAY more basic than that
when it comes to appsec (at least when they're getting a program off
the ground all the way up until we'd anecdotally say a company &quot;has an
appsec program&quot;). In those stages the questions are more like (roughly
in order, tho some oscillation):
 * Is this really a (potential) problem? Usually an easily evinced point.
 * Am I doing anything about it right now?
 * Is what I'm doing good enough or should I be trying to change things?
 * How do we measure any of this madness since I need to manage it?

Dunno if that helps, just my $0.02 while in between flights. Glad to
help further if you want to collaborate on the article.
