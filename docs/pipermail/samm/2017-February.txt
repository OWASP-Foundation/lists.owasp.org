I've worked through basically all the change requests in the spreadsheet.
The documents and toolbox have been uploaded to GitHub.
I have created an "Example" toolbox that is filled out and a blank one for
someone to start from scratch.

Please review and let me know if you find anything.  (thanks Daniel!)
I'll be looking at the press release and other stuff as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Brian

Hi,

I had a look at the three documents at 
https://github.com/OWASP/samm/tree/master/v1.5 and added some comments 
to 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TblUSU-VbTGUgcLBIYeVHkba0HZF7EEgCQaRQnhHr1I/edit#gid=0 
(R54-R76). Not sure I'll be able to make it to the call next Wednesday - 
Brian, if you have any questions to my comments, feel free to ping me 
directly anytime.

I've noticed that my pull request (https://github.com/OWASP/samm/pull/3) 
with the Migration Guide written by Bruce and myself has not been merged 
yet. As people wanted to use it as a base for some other deliverables, 
it might be sensible to merge it (I don't have the rights).

Cheers,
Daniel

Hey Dinis,

currently the deck is on Github (where all SAMM documents are at the
moment).
https://github.com/OWASP/samm/tree/master/v1.5

Once the release is final, we will also put everything for download on the
project site (OWASP wiki).

Best,
Bart.

Subject: [SAMM] SAMM v1.5 Release Candidate for Review
Message-ID: <CAMPYwGWdmNCXTCtn4VLRJA90P+kPuaRhLJ+wsLfdU8yV2LNLJA@mail.gmail.com>

All,
We are nearing the end of the road for the release of SAMM v1.5.
After many meetings and reviews, we present the final release candidate.
There are three documents and two spreadsheets.

The release candidate is available on github:
https://github.com/OWASP/samm/tree/master/v1.5/Release%20Candidate

Please check it out and provide feedback in the spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TblUSU-VbTGUgcLBIYeVHkba0HZF7EEgCQaRQnhHr1I/edit#gid=0

This review cycle ends on Feb 20, 2017, and the release of SAMM v1.5
scheduled for Feb 28, 2017.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed, reviewed, tested, offered
suggestions, and just listened.

Thanks,
Brian Glas
