Subject: [SAMM] Split document - wiki
Message-ID: <CAGvXZhsgUaprD=BfV9XF4gzi0M15D5rkiN9Vp4ak4=jzgjDu=w@mail.gmail.com>

All,

during recent discussions in which directions OpenSAMM could evolve,
we had a discussion whether it would be useful to complement the
current model by a wiki (or similar tool) in which we can put much
more accompanying information about the model. For instance, all
information concerning how to implement a particular activity, which
tools to use, links to other OWASP projects and so forth would nicely
fit there. If we were to include them into the current model, it would
really bloat it and risk of making it unworkable in my opinion. I've
been doing this for an OpenSAMM implementation at a client recently
and this worked very well (we use this for instance for application
security standards, where we have the formal standard and then an
accompanying wiki with much more explanation and practical guidance
about the standard).

Regarding the overall structure of this wiki, there's different
options. One first and logical option would be to use the structure of
the model. Another option could be to split into the type of knowledge
that we're putting there (methods, tools, etc). A third one could be
to use a typical OpenSAMM implementation strategy (if that uberhaupt
exists)... In fact, there's different perspectives onto the
information that will be put on there, and we might have to find a way
to represent these different perspectives. On the other hand, let's
not overcomplicate things from the start :-)

Any strong opinions on whether (or not) and how to do this ?

Best,
Bart.

Sorry I didn't get Back on the call, but I drove into a rural area
without a mobile phone signal.

Regarding "recreating the document", I emailed Pravir about the source
document file, but haven't had a reply yet.

Hi SAMM ers,
One issue we provided input into when we did the first version of SAMM was how the questions were phrased. 
This sounds boring but really affects how people respond. Open ended questions and answers are very hard to score :)
Just a thought.

All,
This is an important question: please chime in on this thread.
I personally believe we should indeed split the model off from the guidance
and howto supporting material, but looking forward to your opinion!

SAMM is a "standard" by which to measure maturity.
If it is changed on a regular basis that won't work as the standard keeps changing.
So I'd out how to on wiki but SAMM process needs to be static.

There, I've chimed in
:)

List,

My Opinion is to keep OpenSAMM  standard as best as we can. It's
important to not change all the things as OpenSAMM is currently used
as a Governance document and generate enterprise process (did you know
how it's hard to change a enterprise process ? ).

After that, I think it could be very interessing for community and
final CISO/CSO to have some "real" implementation strategy and
generate perhaps small and dedicated document who rely on OpenSAMM
standards


My 2 cents (euros, dollars, whatever)

This is a good point. I have taken a similar approach and it has worked for me as well. Are you suggesting we spin a project to build a tool?

My vote is for not overcomplicating, perhaps use the structure of the model. The structure is simple and easy to describe a main strength IMO.

I agree splitting off the model off from  "guidance" to "how to (can be
a tool)" will be an important next step.

I also support the idea, but I also like the idea of creating a [turnkey 
linux](http://www.turnkeylinux.org) distribution than one can download 
and deploy to their local environment to start running a CISO program. 
It could and should contain a complete copy of the wiki (and the wiki 
should point to other OWASP supporting resources when more information 
is required. It should allow automated emailing stakeholders the url 
with the questionnaire at set intervals to measure maturity, it should 
keep a history of every answer so you can monitor improvements or worse 
regressions - it should have a dashboard so you can see at a glance the 
current maturity levels.

We have a great Model; **we should make it as easy to use as possible**.

It should be a 'no-brainer' compared to the competition.
OWASP SAMM should be download, and deploy!

This is my 2??

At the risk of repeating my previous mail to the list on this subject,
my view is that some of this content is required for relevance. 
Presently, I don't see much that does make OpenSAMM relevant.  It would
be nice for that to change so that when one advocates the use of a
generalist and non-vendor attached maturity model, there is something to
work with besides whatever controls or process people spin up in a local
brainstorming session; a generally non-repeatable, non-standard, and
likely difficult to demonstrate proper governance should it be needed.

People want to split specific QA/maturity methods away from generalized
concept model in a wiki?  Fine. 

People want to combine them?  Sure. 

Just please make it relevant to people attempting to stand up a client
program or improve an existing one.  The other option is continued
irrelevance and defacto endorsement of a lock-in vendor workflow which
may or may not benefit anyone except the vendor who has used it to sell
their compliance product.

Remember how we became a compliance industry instead of a security industry.

Cheers,

I will add my 2 cents worth from a personal experience.  I used OpenSAMMto do Software Assurance Program Assessment for a large government agency.   The agency subsequently went on to address the gaps I identified in the program and I had to come up with the processes to incorporate into their SDLC.   The problem is that every government agency and commercial entity alike may differ in how they implement their SDLC as related to security maturity and what they actually do. The agency in question is no exception.   

The processes have to be tailored to each entities specific lifecycle implementation.  Yes, there are some big milestones that everyone has (which may be where we want to focus for OpenSAMM processes), however, its the little rocks that cause the problems during implementation of new processes.  

The solution for me has been to tie the software security program intimately to their compliance program (e.g. FISMA security control compliance) for it to have any teeth.  Government agencies have funding for compliance, but to get it for software assurance it is more difficult because of the cost impacts implementing new processes may have.  I suspect that commercial companys may have the same problems as compliance works its way into that arena (e.g. FedRAMP etc..)

The net is that the guidance is a "tool" for entities to assess their maturity level,  the "how to" on the process side should be tailored to lifecycle activities not specific technologies or implementations. 

I hope the above make sense to everyone.

Subject: Re: [SAMM] Split document - wiki

At the risk of repeating my previous mail to the list on this subject,
my view is that some of this content is required for relevance.
Presently, I don't see much that does make OpenSAMM relevant.  It would
be nice for that to change so that when one advocates the use of a
generalist and non-vendor attached maturity model, there is something to
work with besides whatever controls or process people spin up in a local
brainstorming session; a generally non-repeatable, non-standard, and
likely difficult to demonstrate proper governance should it be needed.

People want to split specific QA/maturity methods away from generalized
concept model in a wiki?  Fine.

People want to combine them?  Sure.

Just please make it relevant to people attempting to stand up a client
program or improve an existing one.  The other option is continued
irrelevance and defacto endorsement of a lock-in vendor workflow which
may or may not benefit anyone except the vendor who has used it to sell
their compliance product.

Remember how we became a compliance industry instead of a security industry.

Cheers,

Hi all,

Currently our chapter is interested to translate OpenSAMM v1.0 to
Indonesian. But I read[1] that there will be OpenSAMM project reboot.
While OpenSAMM v2, where I could get the source of OpenSAMM v1.0 doc?
