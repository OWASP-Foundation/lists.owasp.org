<PRE>Hi Pravir, 

Please feel free to use the information from my post on the OpenSAMM site - my only restriction is that my company name cannot be referenced.
&#160;
Mapping OWASP resources to SAMM will definitely be useful to the community. OWASP provides excellent tools and frameworks and information, but it can sometimes be a challenge to navigate the resources, and it varies in quality and completeness. Let's stay with threat modeling as an example. The best resource I have found at the OWASP site on threat modeling is

<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling</A>

I found the information here well written and easy to follow, although there seemed to be a small amount missing: &quot;To apply STRIDE to the data flow diagram items the following table can be used: TABLE [unfortunately, there isn't one]&quot;?
There are other references to Threat Modeling, for example &quot;Threat Risk Modeling&quot; which are not as comprehensive or complete, it's not clear to me why they are also included on the site - why not consolidate the information on Threat Modeling in one place and make sure it is as comprehensive and accurate as possible?

Regardless, mapping resources from OWASP to the SAMM framework will help the community both with understanding and applying SAMM as well as understanding and applying the broader value of&#160; OWASP's resources. 
/Jim

&gt;<i> Hey Jim.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a great post with feedback that we can use to further 
</I>&gt;<i> refine our
</I>&gt;<i> direction. Unless you have an objection, I'd like to write up 
</I>&gt;<i> post for the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSAMM site highlighting your posts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For some specifics, the comment on a guide for agile development 
</I>&gt;<i> teams is a
</I>&gt;<i> good one. I think we can use an article on applying SAMM to 
</I>&gt;<i> agile models.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a topic I've discussed pretty intensely at conferences with 
</I>&gt;<i> folks like
</I>&gt;<i> Bart De Win and Johan Peeters, and the conclusions have been generally
</I>&gt;<i> positive (there's nothing about SAMM that prevents its use on 
</I>&gt;<i> agile teams).
</I>&gt;<i> That being said we can always use clarifying articles that help 
</I>&gt;<i> make it more
</I>&gt;<i> concrete. Any takers? (Bart... I'm looking at you ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, for attack trees. This was the topic of hot debate after 
</I>&gt;<i> the Beta
</I>&gt;<i> release of SAMM, so the 1.0 is more inclusive of other methods. 
</I>&gt;<i> My take on
</I>&gt;<i> this is that even though attack trees can be a bit unwieldy in 
</I>&gt;<i> graphicalform, breaking them down into outlines certainly works 
</I>&gt;<i> (I've done it before
</I>&gt;<i> and still use them on assessment engagements). The part I like 
</I>&gt;<i> about them is
</I>&gt;<i> that they compose very well and are setup for reuse (once you've 
</I>&gt;<i> built the
</I>&gt;<i> attack tree for a type of attack, you can always attach that 
</I>&gt;<i> whole branch
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere). But I'm sure others have thoughts on this too, and 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd love to
</I>&gt;<i> hear them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One on the reasons (in my understanding) that MS moved away from 
</I>&gt;<i> them is
</I>&gt;<i> that they were forging their Threat Modeling process which has a 
</I>&gt;<i> much larger
</I>&gt;<i> definition in their terminology (something like what I refer to 
</I>&gt;<i> as risk
</I>&gt;<i> analysis). In SAMM, the Threat Assessment practice is focused on
</I>&gt;<i> understanding the attackers (threat agents in some 
</I>&gt;<i> nomenclatures) and their
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities in relation to the business risks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> p.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I recently completed a lightweight organizational assessment, 
</I>&gt;<i> using SAMM&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assessment worksheets. Completing the assessment was 
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; didn&#8217;t have problems understanding what was being asked or 
</I>&gt;<i> why; although
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there were a few questions for some Level 3 practices that 
</I>&gt;<i> were targeted to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enterprise-level concerns (costing, central control, some of 
</I>&gt;<i> the auditing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirements, metrics) that I did not go into much, working 
</I>&gt;<i> from a small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; company perspective. Ok, I did have to look up &quot;Likert&quot; to 
</I>&gt;<i> verify what the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; metric &quot;&gt;3.0 Likert on usefulness of code review 
</I>&gt;<i> activities...&quot; was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; measuring in CR1.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The assessment guided me in a structured way through a review 
</I>&gt;<i> of our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application security assurance program, what we are doing 
</I>&gt;<i> well, where we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to invest more. Going through the assessment was also a 
</I>&gt;<i> good way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; improve my understanding of the SAMM model, the practice areas 
</I>&gt;<i> and maturity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ladder.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The findings from the assessment were generally in line with 
</I>&gt;<i> what we had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already identified through our ad hoc internal analysis and 
</I>&gt;<i> our existing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; roadmap, at least in the areas of Construction and 
</I>&gt;<i> Verification practices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like that SAMM considers more than Construction and 
</I>&gt;<i> Verification, that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also addresses Governance (including training) in a simple and 
</I>&gt;<i> practical way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (at least for level 1 and 2), as well as Deployment practices 
</I>&gt;<i> (vulnerability&gt; management, environment hardening, operational 
</I>&gt;<i> enablement), so I was able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take into account at least some of the requirements of 
</I>&gt;<i> operations without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having to put on a different hat (ITIL, Visible Ops, SANS, and 
</I>&gt;<i> so on.). This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should help teams work on the boundaries where software 
</I>&gt;<i> assurance ends and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; secure infrastructure management and operations begins, rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than throwing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the problem over the fence to operations / your customer to 
</I>&gt;<i> take care of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also like that Vulnerability Management is considered an 
</I>&gt;<i> important part
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the software assurance model. It makes sense to me that a 
</I>&gt;<i> consistent&gt; mechanism should be put into place for handling 
</I>&gt;<i> security risks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vulnerabilities and incidents, including incident management 
</I>&gt;<i> and root cause
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; analysis, within the software development / project team 
</I>&gt;<i> structure; aligning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this with what is done for secure deployment and operations of 
</I>&gt;<i> the system,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and within the larger context of business risk management.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Using the assessment as a planning tool was also simple: 
</I>&gt;<i> building the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assessment score card from the worksheets; identifying gaps 
</I>&gt;<i> and areas for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development, and then referring to the roadmaps for examples, 
</I>&gt;<i> ideas where to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prioritize effort. The sample roadmaps provided good coverage, 
</I>&gt;<i> at least for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my purposes (building software for financial services 
</I>&gt;<i> customers). There are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some good guidelines on handling outsourced scenarios in the 
</I>&gt;<i> roadmaps. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be helpful if there were also guidelines on how to apply 
</I>&gt;<i> SAMM to agile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development, for teams that follow lighter-weight methods and 
</I>&gt;<i> practices,&gt; maybe as part of the ISV roadmap. The case study 
</I>&gt;<i> example was also helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The next challenge is hunting down resources from all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> good stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available from OWASP to support improvement activities. I am 
</I>&gt;<i> happy to see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that work has started to make this easier. I can see that 
</I>&gt;<i> there will be some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interesting challenges in this. For example, Threat 
</I>&gt;<i> Assessment: SAMM TA1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommends attack trees as a less formal alternative to 
</I>&gt;<i> STRIDE, Trike, etc.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and provides a brief description of attack trees. Now I can 
</I>&gt;<i> google &#8220;attack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trees&#8221; and find some helpful information out there in the wide 
</I>&gt;<i> world. But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is not much available in OWASP itself on attack trees, 
</I>&gt;<i> except for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; note from some poor guy unsuccessfully searching for 
</I>&gt;<i> information on attack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trees in CLASP at one time, and a thread in 2007 where Dinis 
</I>&gt;<i> Cruz said that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microsoft gave up on using attack trees in threat modelling 
</I>&gt;<i> because of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complexity and difficulty reading them. Whoa pardner, this 
</I>&gt;<i> isn&#8217;t what I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hoping to find :-(
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of the keys to me, as a software development guy, not a security
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expert, is that I need clear and actionable guidance where 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot of work to do. I really don&#8217;t want to get in the middle 
</I>&gt;<i> of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantic war around Microsoft&#8217;s definition of Threat Modelling 
</I>&gt;<i> vs what other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security experts define as Threat Modelling. And then there&#8217;s 
</I>&gt;<i> Attack Models
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and Architectural Risk Analysis (which don&#8217;t show up in SAMM, 
</I>&gt;<i> as far as I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can see &#8211; indexing SAMM would help! - but of course are key to 
</I>&gt;<i> BSIMM).&gt; Mapping resources from OWASP to SAMM practices in a 
</I>&gt;<i> consistent way will make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a hard job, building secure software, much easier :-)
