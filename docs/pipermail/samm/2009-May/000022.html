Hi all,

During the last OWASP chapter meeting in London, Dinis tossed out the idea of using SAMM to evaluate OWASP as an organization.  I'd like to pursue this with the OWASP board, and look to pilot SAMM with a couple OWASP projects over the next few months.  In reality, I guess it will be a combination of assessing OWASP from the top down, and using a couple projects to provide some sort of meaningful score cards.
 
After some light conversation with Pravir, he suggested raising the topic on this list and I'm currently looking for a couple other interested parties to help with the idea.
 
I believe OWASP would present some interesting challenges that any large organization might face (distributed development teams, varying levels of maturity across projects, non-standard approach to using tools, etc).  I think the goal should be to develop an additional documented case study and feed back any learning lessons into the SAMM project.  Additionally, if the pilot is successful, we can help OWASP begin measuring their own maturity and developing a software security roadmap to ensure all projects are achieving a high standard of care.
 
I am happy to lead the effort, but I'd like to find at least 1 or 2 others to actively contribute.
 
Anyone interested?
 
Thanks,
Nathan
