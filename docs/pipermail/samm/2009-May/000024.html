<PRE>Hey Jim.
This is a great post with feedback that we can use to further refine our
direction. Unless you have an objection, I'd like to write up post for the
OpenSAMM site highlighting your posts.

For some specifics, the comment on a guide for agile development teams is a
good one. I think we can use an article on applying SAMM to agile models.
It's a topic I've discussed pretty intensely at conferences with folks like
Bart De Win and Johan Peeters, and the conclusions have been generally
positive (there's nothing about SAMM that prevents its use on agile teams).
That being said we can always use clarifying articles that help make it more
concrete. Any takers? (Bart... I'm looking at you ;)

Also, for attack trees. This was the topic of hot debate after the Beta
release of SAMM, so the 1.0 is more inclusive of other methods. My take on
this is that even though attack trees can be a bit unwieldy in graphical
form, breaking them down into outlines certainly works (I've done it before
and still use them on assessment engagements). The part I like about them is
that they compose very well and are setup for reuse (once you've built the
attack tree for a type of attack, you can always attach that whole branch
elsewhere). But I'm sure others have thoughts on this too, and I'd love to
hear them.

One on the reasons (in my understanding) that MS moved away from them is
that they were forging their Threat Modeling process which has a much larger
definition in their terminology (something like what I refer to as risk
analysis). In SAMM, the Threat Assessment practice is focused on
understanding the attackers (threat agents in some nomenclatures) and their
capabilities in relation to the business risks.

&gt;<i> I recently completed a lightweight organizational assessment, using SAMM&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> assessment worksheets. Completing the assessment was straightforward. I
</I>&gt;<i> didn&#8217;t have problems understanding what was being asked or why; although
</I>&gt;<i> there were a few questions for some Level 3 practices that were targeted to
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise-level concerns (costing, central control, some of the auditing
</I>&gt;<i> requirements, metrics) that I did not go into much, working from a small
</I>&gt;<i> company perspective. Ok, I did have to look up &quot;Likert&quot; to verify what the
</I>&gt;<i> metric &quot;&gt;3.0 Likert on usefulness of code review activities...&quot; was
</I>&gt;<i> measuring in CR1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The assessment guided me in a structured way through a review of our
</I>&gt;<i> application security assurance program, what we are doing well, where we
</I>&gt;<i> need to invest more. Going through the assessment was also a good way to
</I>&gt;<i> improve my understanding of the SAMM model, the practice areas and maturity
</I>&gt;<i> ladder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The findings from the assessment were generally in line with what we had
</I>&gt;<i> already identified through our ad hoc internal analysis and our existing
</I>&gt;<i> roadmap, at least in the areas of Construction and Verification practices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like that SAMM considers more than Construction and Verification, that it
</I>&gt;<i> also addresses Governance (including training) in a simple and practical way
</I>&gt;<i> (at least for level 1 and 2), as well as Deployment practices (vulnerability
</I>&gt;<i> management, environment hardening, operational enablement), so I was able to
</I>&gt;<i> take into account at least some of the requirements of operations without
</I>&gt;<i> having to put on a different hat (ITIL, Visible Ops, SANS, and so on.). This
</I>&gt;<i> should help teams work on the boundaries where software assurance ends and
</I>&gt;<i> secure infrastructure management and operations begins, rather than throwing
</I>&gt;<i> the problem over the fence to operations / your customer to take care of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also like that Vulnerability Management is considered an important part
</I>&gt;<i> of the software assurance model. It makes sense to me that a consistent
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism should be put into place for handling security risks,
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities and incidents, including incident management and root cause
</I>&gt;<i> analysis, within the software development / project team structure; aligning
</I>&gt;<i> this with what is done for secure deployment and operations of the system,
</I>&gt;<i> and within the larger context of business risk management.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using the assessment as a planning tool was also simple: building the
</I>&gt;<i> assessment score card from the worksheets; identifying gaps and areas for
</I>&gt;<i> development, and then referring to the roadmaps for examples, ideas where to
</I>&gt;<i> prioritize effort. The sample roadmaps provided good coverage, at least for
</I>&gt;<i> my purposes (building software for financial services customers). There are
</I>&gt;<i> some good guidelines on handling outsourced scenarios in the roadmaps. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be helpful if there were also guidelines on how to apply SAMM to agile
</I>&gt;<i> development, for teams that follow lighter-weight methods and practices,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe as part of the ISV roadmap. The case study example was also helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next challenge is hunting down resources from all of the good stuff
</I>&gt;<i> available from OWASP to support improvement activities. I am happy to see
</I>&gt;<i> that work has started to make this easier. I can see that there will be some
</I>&gt;<i> interesting challenges in this. For example, Threat Assessment: SAMM TA1
</I>&gt;<i> recommends attack trees as a less formal alternative to STRIDE, Trike, etc.,
</I>&gt;<i> and provides a brief description of attack trees. Now I can google &#8220;attack
</I>&gt;<i> trees&#8221; and find some helpful information out there in the wide world. But
</I>&gt;<i> there is not much available in OWASP itself on attack trees, except for a
</I>&gt;<i> note from some poor guy unsuccessfully searching for information on attack
</I>&gt;<i> trees in CLASP at one time, and a thread in 2007 where Dinis Cruz said that
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft gave up on using attack trees in threat modelling because of
</I>&gt;<i> complexity and difficulty reading them. Whoa pardner, this isn&#8217;t what I was
</I>&gt;<i> hoping to find :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the keys to me, as a software development guy, not a security
</I>&gt;<i> expert, is that I need clear and actionable guidance where possible. I have
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of work to do. I really don&#8217;t want to get in the middle of the
</I>&gt;<i> semantic war around Microsoft&#8217;s definition of Threat Modelling vs what other
</I>&gt;<i> security experts define as Threat Modelling. And then there&#8217;s Attack Models
</I>&gt;<i> and Architectural Risk Analysis (which don&#8217;t show up in SAMM, as far as I
</I>&gt;<i> can see &#8211; indexing SAMM would help! - but of course are key to BSIMM).
</I>&gt;<i> Mapping resources from OWASP to SAMM practices in a consistent way will make
</I>&gt;<i> a hard job, building secure software, much easier :-)
