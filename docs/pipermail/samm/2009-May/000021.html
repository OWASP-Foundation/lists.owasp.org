I recently completed a
lightweight organizational assessment, using SAMM&#8217;s assessment worksheets.
Completing the assessment was straightforward. I didn&#8217;t have problems
understanding what was being asked or why; although there were a few questions
for some Level 3 practices that were targeted to enterprise-level concerns
(costing, central control, some of the auditing requirements, metrics) that I
did not go into much, working from a small company perspective. Ok, I did have to look up &quot;Likert&quot; to verify what the metric &quot;&gt;3.0 Likert on usefulness of code review activities...&quot; was measuring in CR1.
The assessment guided
me in a structured way through a review of our application security assurance
program, what we are doing well, where we need to invest more. Going through
the assessment was also a good way to improve my understanding of the SAMM
model, the practice areas and maturity ladder.

The findings
from the assessment were generally in line with what we had already identified
through our ad hoc internal analysis and our existing roadmap, at least in the
areas of Construction and Verification practices.

I like that
SAMM considers more than Construction and Verification, that it also addresses
Governance (including training) in a simple and practical way (at least for
level 1 and 2), as well as Deployment practices (vulnerability management,
environment hardening, operational enablement), so I was able to take into
account at least some of the requirements of operations without having to put
on a different hat (ITIL, Visible Ops, SANS, and so on.). This should help
teams work on the boundaries where software assurance ends and secure
infrastructure management and operations begins, rather than throwing the
problem over the fence to operations / your customer to take care of.

I also like
that Vulnerability Management is considered an important part of the software
assurance model. It makes sense to me that a consistent mechanism should be put
into place for handling security risks, vulnerabilities and incidents, including
incident management and root cause analysis, within the software development /
project team structure; aligning this with what is done for secure deployment
and operations of the system, and within the larger context of business risk management.

Using the
assessment as a planning tool was also simple: building the assessment score
card from the worksheets; identifying gaps and areas for development, and then
referring to the roadmaps for examples, ideas where to prioritize effort. The sample
roadmaps provided good coverage, at least for my purposes (building software
for financial services customers). There are some good guidelines on handling outsourced
scenarios in the roadmaps. It would be helpful if there were also guidelines on
how to apply SAMM to agile development, for teams that follow lighter-weight
methods and practices, maybe as part of the ISV roadmap. The case study example
was also helpful.

The next
challenge is hunting down resources from all of the good stuff available from OWASP
to support improvement activities. I am happy to see that work has started to
make this easier. I can see that there will
be some interesting challenges in this. For example, Threat Assessment: SAMM TA1
recommends attack trees as a less formal alternative to STRIDE, Trike, etc.,
and provides a brief description of attack trees. Now I can google &#8220;attack
trees&#8221; and find some helpful information out there in the wide world. But there is not much available in
OWASP itself on attack trees, except for a note from some poor guy unsuccessfully
searching for information on attack trees in CLASP at one time, and a thread in
2007 where Dinis Cruz said that Microsoft gave up on using attack trees in
threat modelling because of complexity and difficulty reading them. Whoa pardner,
this isn&#8217;t what I was hoping to find :-( 

One of the
keys to me, as a software development guy, not a security expert, is that I need clear and actionable guidance where possible. I have a lot of work to do. I really don&#8217;t want to get in the middle of the semantic war around Microsoft&#8217;s definition of Threat
Modelling vs what other security experts define as Threat Modelling. And then
there&#8217;s Attack Models and Architectural Risk Analysis (which don&#8217;t show up in
SAMM, as far as I can see &#8211; indexing SAMM would help! - but of course are key
to BSIMM). Mapping resources from OWASP to SAMM practices in a consistent way will make a hard job,
building secure software, much easier :-)/Jim Bird
