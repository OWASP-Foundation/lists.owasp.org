I've been working on creating the Roadmap Charts dynamically after Eoin
asked if it could be done "server side".  The Excel was a bit of a bodge
anyway.  Well I came up with another idea - SVG.  Given a data XML file and
an XSLT file, we can build charts pretty close to those in the SAMM
document.  The data file looks like:

<sammchart>
 <title>Figure 1: Example Organisation</title>
 <bgcolor>#ffffff</bgcolor>
 <phases>
   <phase>
<name>Phase 1</name>
<description>January to May 2010</description>
   </phase>
   etc
<roadmaps>
 <roadmap abbr="SM" ordering="1" label1="Strategy &amp;" label2="Metrics"
functionstyle="sammgovernance">
   <point>1</point>
   <point>1</point>
   <point>2</point>
   <point>2</point>
   <point>3</point>
</roadmap>
     etc

Three files attached (screen grabbed as PNGs):


   - roadmap created to match the example on p27
   - two early attempts that didn't quite work (but may reflect real
   software development)


Does anyone have XPath/XSLT experience who could check/improve upon my code
before I upload the files/instructions to the list?

Subject: [SAMM] SAMM Audit Framework
Message-ID: <fd72f3ed1003301200g6f5e7e9bmaf93f35278045952@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, we've put together an audit framework based on the efforts of
a couple of others on this mailing and SAMM as well as our own
experience. We wanted to frame it in the language of controls auditing
so that we can start to push it to the people who have the power to
require it (i.e.controls auditor). We liked and built off the efforts
of Nick Coblentz's SAMM Assessment Interview Template
(http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rYpVqQR3026Zu4DNg8LBIwg&gid=0)
and Christian Frichot's SAMM-Assessment Worksheet -  both available
int the archives of this mailing list.

Ours is slightly more targeted to an external auditor and is based on
our experience of assessing SDLCs in the real world.

You can find a short write-up and link to the actual framework here:

I'd love to hear any feedback you have

Thanks,

McGovern's sporadic brain dump of thoughts in making SAMM better (?)


I am of the school of thought that says we need to serve both external
and internal auditors equally. External auditors will look at the
maturity of the organization at large where an internal auditor may look
at the divisions, departments, particular teams, etc.

Is there a difference in auditing a software development effort for a
large enterprise when development is internal vs. when it is 100%
outsourced in an offshore model? What aspects of maturity are transitive
between business partners and what aspects are separate?

Does the SecurityCompass work call out the need to better specify how
auditors as a role play within SAMM?

There are a few things hinted at within PCI that we should also
consider. Should we figure out how to ask: Is the software development
methodology well understood by the engineers building the software? This
is more than general enthusiasm but trends into correlation techniques
amongst interviewees/samples.

How do we account for clarity when roles are defined by team members?
Think specializing generalist.

Should maturity have some notion of the real-world impact to failing a
phased gate review?

Can we address buildability of software? Is a developer required to do
say static analysis before checking in?

Should test plans be reviewed outside of QA (and not the repeat-after-me
business buy-in)

Is there an ideal ratio between functional and negative testing?

If there is maturity, how can we measure the scalability of the process?
