1. If we believe that the someone in the process that provides Software
Security Assurance, do we also believe this individual should be separate
from the development team? PCI seems to think so. Do you know that I tell my
son's to review all of my code before they get to go to Chuck e. Cheeses?
Care to guess how quickly my code gets reviewed? NOTE: The nine year old has
already found uses for WebScarab in changing parms for the games he plays.

RKF :  To your first question, the answer is yes, but the spectrum can be
from informal to very formal depending on where you are in the maturity
model and what your business is.  There are many models for defining each
level, but it usually ends up that the highest level is national security.
Most businesses are several levels below that.

RKF:  As far as the rest of the text, not sure what point you are trying to
make.  But I think the point that should be made is kids are smart and
absorb things like sponges so we should make sure they understand the issue
of security:  not that horrible things can happen (which you and I know can)
but undesirable things may happen so you should protect yourself.

2. We shouldn't assume that the developers even understand business context.
Think about the throw it over the wall model better known as outsourcing.
They are given &quot;instructions&quot; such as put widget X on page Y without any
additional context or participation from above (us US-based enterprisey
types)

RKF:  I think this is an issue set apart from security.  Most organizations
I have worked with, the developers do understand the business context.  To
your point, if it is outsourced to a commodity shop, then yes, business
context is the first order of business before you can begin to address
security.

The word that bothers me in this discussion is the word &quot;auditor.&quot;

An auditor can never effectively look at code and determine if it is secure
or not.

An auditor can only look at controls and see if they are effective or not
based upon sampling.

My belief is there needs to be someone in the process that provides Software
Security Assurance (SSA).

They are the control.  And that control needs to be matured into the
organization.

It starts with code review and working with the developers, dynamic code
review and working with the developer, on and on.

Eventually the developer themselves will have infused with them the
knowledge that will help them write more secure code with no productivity
loss.

An auditor can't secure code because they won't understand the business
application.

Understanding the business application will require working with the
developers where both the SSA and learn from each other.

James,

I agree with your points below. Again, my point is only that it
doesn't have to be combative/mutually exclusive when you can find
overlap and opportunity.

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Code review not always the same as peer review. When looking at
</I>approaches such as XP where a team may be doing pair programming, there is
no discrete &quot;event&quot; for an auditor to measure. Likewise, difficult for
auditor to understand whether everyone is held to same standard
(consistency)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Let's keep terminology clean when it comes to Agile and think about the
</I>notion of User Stories as a superset or control around enumerated
requirements. User Stories can also have a security slant. User Stories are
created by users/business customers while artifacts such as threat models
tend to be created by IT types. If you look at how most shops operate, the
user story is actually more important since it may actually cause the
creation of requirements around it which in turn get tested by QA. Threat
models while valuable rarely have the same effect or traceability
characteristics.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Static analysis can only identify issues that are &quot;findable&quot; at coding
</I>time. Creating an artifact that late in the lifecycle is actually a
suboptimal idea. Higher maturity is created if we can address security in an
agile way at whatever feels like an architecture/design review. While this
can't be automated, it can be done against a set of prescribed principles
such as defense in depth, least privilege, etc.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Many of the static analysis tools such as Ounce Labs, Fortify, etc can
</I>produce pretty dashboards articulating counts of highs, mediums, lows but
doesn't provide the next step that would be truly valuable to an auditor
which would be to align the findings with something like the OWASP Risk
Rating method. I remember lots of painful conversations where there were
1000s of highs that resulted in low risk in one application where in
another, there were 6 mediums and 1 low where it was possible to get your
hands on a credit card and some PII data. ?Since Pravir works for Fortify, I
will let him noodle this statement to see if he believes there is a better
way :-)
