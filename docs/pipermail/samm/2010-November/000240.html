<PRE>Being from an &quot;enterprise&quot; background, I am of the belief that CLASP has
accomplished its mission. While we collectively can make minor
improvements and come out with an updated version, the reality is that
SAMM will add orders of magnitude additional value to enterprises than
CLASP could ever hope for. With that being said, there is some merit in
asking on the CLASP mailing list, what are the things you would tweak to
make CLASP better?

Subject: [SAMM] CLASP vs SAMM

 

I was interested to see a chapter covering CLASP in Mark Merkow and
Laksh Raghanvan's new book &quot;Secure and Resilient Software Development&quot;.
This raised some questions about the state of support for CLASP and its
roadmap. I was under the impression that CLASP was going to be replaced
over time by SAMM: as Pravir called SAMM &quot;CLASP on steroids&quot; at one
point. I thought that CLASP was going to be orphaned as a result.

Now I understand that SAMM is at its core a maturity model not a secure
SDLC so this was confusing to me at the time and still is confusing.
I've been following both mailing lists for some time now (there has been
essentially nothing on CLASP in a long time so it hasn't been
distracting).CLASP doesn't seem to be actively maintained and isn't
keeping up with the other mainline initiatives at OWASP. SAMM has much
more momentum behind it, and is a more active project. But I don't see
how the two projects will converge.

To be honest I was surprised that a brand new book would reference
CLASP. As a software developer looking for a secure SDLC for a
reference, it makes a lot more sense to work with Microsoft's SDL than
CLASP given that SDL is more current and complete and has a lot more
resources and momentum. Is CLASP still alive? And how are CLASP and SAMM
supposed to fit together?
