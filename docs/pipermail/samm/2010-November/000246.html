<PRE>1. I think we should do something with Jon's comments and not just let them linger in the email archive. Is there merit in capturing the below thoughts and making it a SAMM appendix?

2. With the advent of &quot;business architecture&quot; I think we should figure out a way to also give credit to shops that capture &quot;threats&quot; in a business sense. For example, in the Hartford, former CEO articulated that he wouldn't want to see a listing of high net-worth annuitants leak. When strategies equally articulate both the optimistic and pessimistic perspectives, it is likely to be more mature. Ran across way to many &quot;strategies&quot; that were happy path and didn't provide a sense as to what they even needed to protect.

3. My thought regarding sprints (and maturity) is that if the team thinks of security as strictly authentication and authorization then it is a fail. Sometimes teams will articulate authentication as a feature such that they may have a requirement such as: I want a user to be able to use their Active Directory credentials to access an application, but won't think about other aspects such as what happens if someone is using their active directory credentials outside the network from a kiosk in Cuba at midnight. I think too many &quot;auditors&quot; will mark security is good by thinking of security as a &quot;feature&quot;. Authentication tends to be visible where other forms of security (or insecurity) may not be.

4. I know of more than a few shops that have embraced &quot;authentication as a service&quot; and have deployed web access management products such as Siteminder. Likewise, if you look hard enough, you will also find that many of these same shops have deployed web access management products insecurely. The challenge is that if you deploy a web access management product on the &quot;web server&quot;, your application may be reading a &quot;cookie&quot; which can afford the opportunity for tampering. We have to figure out whether the usage of security products results in more or less maturity. NOTE: The point-and-shoot web vulnerability scanners don't find this type of vulnerability that otherwise is easily discovered by humans.

5. Having a sprint with the goal of &quot;squash all XSS bugs&quot; is a non-starter in the world of Scrum, since the sprint is constrained by time and not outcome. Likewise, the ability to &quot;demo&quot; it tends to be a challenge for development teams even with those who are security literate. Maybe a measure of how many security concerns that are placed on the backlog is the next best option? NOTE: In waterfall shops, we may refer to this as &quot;Day Two&quot; activities and we know how often day two actually comes.

Subject: [SAMM] Agile Software Development

James,

Your reply poses two questions. First, &quot;Are security-oriented sprints
advisable?&quot; This question conjures the classic set of security
objections:

* You can't bolt security on later
* Security is an emergent property, it must be foremost in one's mind
during every release
* and so forth.

I don't disagree with those old saws. I've seen very productive
security (and other non-functional) sprints though. In particular,
I've seen security sprints provide the following benefits for
well-trained teams:

* Integrating with a security service, provided by shared services (such as URL-
  based authentication)
* Upgrading from a stub-implementation to a proper security control (such as
  encrypted channels or stores)
* Adding business logic rules for previous end-to-end proof-of-concepts (such
  as support for invaliding log-ins after an ID is deleted in SSO)

These feature-related sprint goals fit easily. I've also experienced
teams using sprints for exploration/prototyping, with goals such as:

* Identify all entities containing PII
* Conduct exploratory (security) testing to determine with XXX is exploitable
* Identify all components affected by YYY authorization check

On the other hand, I've not seen a single sprint &quot;squash all XSS bugs&quot;
or &quot;implement access control, application-wide&quot; or similar.

Note the slippery slope between 'integrating with a security service'
and 'implementing access control, application-wide'. James, I don't
expect that someone of your experience would make this mistake (in
fact, quite the contrary) but I did find that a key success factor was
the team's ability to break larger tasks up into sprint-sized chunks
in order to keep to standard sprint sizes. The last group of sprint
goals was designed to do exactly that. Each served as part of a larger
multi-sprint initiative. One team in particular was particularly good
at this kind of multi-sprint planning as they were used to dealing
with this in the realm of performance/scalability: they had gone from
Sql-lite to a fancy Oracle back-end. This was not their first
rodeo.What was neat, for me, was that they needed very little
&quot;Security SME&quot; to decompose their security tasks into sprint-sized
chunks once the misuse was documented... or the impact of the shared
service was understood... or... :D

</I>&gt;<i> James,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that many maturity models can penalize agile methods. When it
</I>&gt;<i> comes to security this need-not be true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've helped a few organizations adopt security activities within an
</I>&gt;<i> agile framework. Several activities were easy to introduce as
</I>&gt;<i> evolutionary or incremental steps for existing activities--rather than
</I>&gt;<i> revolutionary change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Simple improvements included :(*1):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Misuse/abuse case documentation (AM2.1)
</I>&gt;<i> * Create security features guidance (SFD 1.1)
</I>&gt;<i> * Identification of reuse opportunities (SFD 2.3) (*2)
</I>&gt;<i> * Use of Findbugs/etc (CR3.1)
</I>&gt;<i> * Peer (code) review
</I>&gt;<i> * Create security tests (AM3.2)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I arrived to find some of these activities in place, introduced some
</I>&gt;<i> others, and others emerged from conversations with agile
</I>&gt;<i> teams--without much arm-twisting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other activities occurred as well, I've just provided a partial list
</I>&gt;<i> here. While I specifically avoided listing infrastructural activities
</I>&gt;<i> (like policy, etc.) notice that at least one agile team I worked with
</I>&gt;<i> did set out and create some security features guidance internal to
</I>&gt;<i> their dev team: a 'shadow' of their organization's security policy.
</I>&gt;<i> They had someone sharp on their team interpret policy/stds. and cast
</I>&gt;<i> it in usable terms for the tiger-team doing development to keep handy.
</I>&gt;<i> This was clever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's particularly interesting here is that activities related to
</I>&gt;<i> design, another purportedly de-prioritized element of agile process,
</I>&gt;<i> remains well represented. &#160;Perhaps this is my bias ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -jOHN
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (*1) - Coded &#160;with BSIMM identifiers despite fear that it will
</I>&gt;<i> generate cries of sacrilege b/c organizations got credit for doing
</I>&gt;<i> these activities when they were surveyed. This is proof beyond my
</I>&gt;<i> email that not only did someone following Agile do security activities
</I>&gt;<i> but that to maturity model folk--it mattered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (*2) - One case was OWASP ESAPI, one was an internal (LoB) toolkit,
</I>&gt;<i> another was internal (provided by shared services)
