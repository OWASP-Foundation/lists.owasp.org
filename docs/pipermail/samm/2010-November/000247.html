<PRE>

The problem from a software development perspective is that
maturity models and process frameworks are part of what Agile teams are
reacting against: &#8220;process for process sake&#8221;, high-ceremony,
documentation-heavy, more time needed upfront, more time needed downstream. A
good Agile or Lean software team is going to want to resist anything that doesn&#8217;t
directly contribute to delivering working code to a customer quickly. This is
taken to extremes with the latest fad of Continuous Deployment where developers run through their code through some automated tests and deploy straight to
production so that they can get immediate feedback. Suicide from a security (and
reliability) point of view of course, but it shows how extreme some teams are
taking these ideas.

I don&#8217;t know too many Agile teams, even more responsible
ones who don&#8217;t buy into Continuous Deployment, who are going to understand the
point of a maturity model, or try to use one, even one as relatively simple as
SAMM. And BSIMM is even more heavyweight, reasonably so since it is targeted to
enterprises &#8211; but at over 100 measurement areas it is too much for an Agile
team to think about or try to work with. Take SAMM, which I am more familiar
with. There is a lot of emphasis on governance, and strategy and policies and
metrics and audits. This is not what an Agile organization is about. 

Even requirements and architecture are a hard sell &#8211; as you
pointed out James, assessing is about looking at documents, these models
emphasize documents, and an Agile team is going to create only what
documentation is needed to get the job done. What matters to them is working
closely with the customer and delivering code that meets the customer's needs. With an Agile team, you need other ways than looking at
documentation to find evidence that the work is being done. So rather than
asking whether something is documented or formally reviewed, it might be better
to be able to ask the team questions that probe and verify their understanding of
problems. For example in SAMM it asks under Design Review &#8220;Do project teams
document the attack perimeter of software designs?&#8221; Now, what is this question
really asking? It&#8217;s not about whether something got written down &#8211; writing it
down doesn&#8217;t mean it gets dealt with. It&#8217;s asking whether the team understands
the attack surface of what they are building and where the risk areas are and
how they are going to handle them. So changing questions like this, questions that
are clearly documentation check-marks, to get to the point behind the document might
help. 

Adapting the maturity models to Agile is tough in other
cases because of the speed at which Agile teams move, the speed at which code
is delivered. Look at something simple like pen testing. In SAMM it asks if pen
testing is done prior to release. Well, if you are releasing every couple of
weeks (or every day or even x times a day for some teams), what does this mean?

It might make sense to come up with a compromise, in the
same way that Microsoft has tried to adapt the SDL to come up with SDL-Agile. To
identify the core practices that Agile teams should focus on, and recognize
that there needs to be / should be some foundational practices and some practices
that should be wrapped into sprints. In my experience managing small software
teams, it makes sense to start with coding &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the code. So for
example:

-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Education: people who write software like to get
training, as long as it is good training. So training on software security
awareness and defensive programming is an easy sell. The team needs to
understand software security first. Everybody. Including, and especially as Adrian
Lane pointed out at OWASP AppSec this year, the Product Manager/Product Owner.

-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Code reviews and static analysis: a responsible
Agile team cares about the quality of the code. So making sure that security
checks are included in code reviews / pair programming makes sense (after
people have been trained so that they know what to look for). And any
responsible team is going to be following Continuous Integration. Adding static
analysis to CI is relatively straightforward if you do it from the start.
Harder of course if you already have a lot of code in place. But the tools will
help.

This is only a start of course: SDL-Agile is a good model to
reference, although a lot of teams, even teams that try hard, will fall short
in key areas like threat modeling because of the costs. 

But I&#8217;m afraid that at some point a maturity model doesn&#8217;t fit.
Helping Agile organizations to get to level 1, to basic good practices and
responsible awareness should be the goal. From there they should continue to
improve themselves through the inspect-and-adapt cycle, with help from security
experts as required. Asking Agile organizations to assess themselves against
some model and move further up some ladder is essentially meaningless. It&#8217;s
against how they work and the way that they think. It&#8217;s going back 20 years to
SEI CMM and CMMI maturity ladders that these people have already explicitly rejected.
They&#8217;ve already found a different way that works better for them. It&#8217;s up to
the security community to accept that and find ways to support it.

&gt;<i> Many maturity models penalize Agile approaches to software development
