<PRE>The word that bothers me in this discussion is the word &quot;auditor.&quot;

An auditor can never effectively look at code and determine if it is secure
or not.

An auditor can only look at controls and see if they are effective or not
based upon sampling.

My belief is there needs to be someone in the process that provides Software
Security Assurance (SSA).

They are the control.  And that control needs to be matured into the
organization.

It starts with code review and working with the developers, dynamic code
review and working with the developer, on and on.

Eventually the developer themselves will have infused with them the
knowledge that will help them write more secure code with no productivity
loss.

An auditor can't secure code because they won't understand the business
application.

Understanding the business application will require working with the
developers where both the SSA and learn from each other.

James,

I agree with your points below. Again, my point is only that it
doesn't have to be combative/mutually exclusive when you can find
overlap and opportunity.

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Code review not always the same as peer review. When looking at
</I>approaches such as XP where a team may be doing pair programming, there is
no discrete &quot;event&quot; for an auditor to measure. Likewise, difficult for
auditor to understand whether everyone is held to same standard
(consistency)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Let's keep terminology clean when it comes to Agile and think about the
</I>notion of User Stories as a superset or control around enumerated
requirements. User Stories can also have a security slant. User Stories are
created by users/business customers while artifacts such as threat models
tend to be created by IT types. If you look at how most shops operate, the
user story is actually more important since it may actually cause the
creation of requirements around it which in turn get tested by QA. Threat
models while valuable rarely have the same effect or traceability
characteristics.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Static analysis can only identify issues that are &quot;findable&quot; at coding
</I>time. Creating an artifact that late in the lifecycle is actually a
suboptimal idea. Higher maturity is created if we can address security in an
agile way at whatever feels like an architecture/design review. While this
can't be automated, it can be done against a set of prescribed principles
such as defense in depth, least privilege, etc.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Many of the static analysis tools such as Ounce Labs, Fortify, etc can
</I>produce pretty dashboards articulating counts of highs, mediums, lows but
doesn't provide the next step that would be truly valuable to an auditor
which would be to align the findings with something like the OWASP Risk
Rating method. I remember lots of painful conversations where there were
1000s of highs that resulted in low risk in one application where in
another, there were 6 mediums and 1 low where it was possible to get your
hands on a credit card and some PII data. ?Since Pravir works for Fortify, I
will let him noodle this statement to see if he believes there is a better
way :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jim,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like James' email, it's hard to disagree with your points. Agile's
</I>&gt;<i> rows against process/governance are as predictable as in the reverse,
</I>&gt;<i> for good reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The net is this: Agile teams can be opposed towards docs/process but
</I>&gt;<i> rarely do they have the skills, irreplaceability, and executive
</I>&gt;<i> support to completely inoculate themselves against all
</I>&gt;<i> audit/governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's why, with the experiences I shared, I tried to keep things in
</I>&gt;<i> the perspective of &quot;Agile teams got credit for [activity XXX], which
</I>&gt;<i> they were already doing&quot;. In cases where they weren't already
</I>&gt;<i> conducting the activity (or were doing so without a specific eye
</I>&gt;<i> towards security), it was painless to add.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The object, in my opinion, should be to make small changes to behavior
</I>&gt;<i> that dramatically affect security outcomes, without having to change
</I>&gt;<i> development culture. Where Agile folk are doing good stuff, the push
</I>&gt;<i> should be to 'translate' this stuff into credit within the applied
</I>&gt;<i> maturity model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that rather than requirements, I mentioned misuse cases (very
</I>&gt;<i> akin to user stories the teams already did).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than architecture, security toolkit reuse occurred and threats
</I>&gt;<i> were identified (did I mention threats in my last email? That might
</I>&gt;<i> have been an omission)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've found neat use of static analysis to provide assurance cases too.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than documenting requirements compliant with a policy teams
</I>&gt;<i> have implemented custom rules that produce assurance that a security
</I>&gt;<i> toolkit was applied thoroughly across an application (in their Hudson
</I>&gt;<i> build). When auditors come around and said, &quot;Hey, our policies say you
</I>&gt;<i> need requirements against XSS&quot; the team was able to respond,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We don't do that. But! we did identify a need to protect against that
</I>&gt;<i> and our nightly builds' results show our commitment to that hygiene.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Auditors needed to be trained to recognize that behavior as OK. This
</I>&gt;<i> seems to gel with your experience as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second net is this: organizations in which Agile and
</I>&gt;<i> process/audit/MM's coexist need to recognize that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Securing agile dev won't require special activities outside their MM's
</I>canon
&gt;<i> * Adjusting inputs/outputs/activities for agile teams may be more natural
</I>&gt;<i> ?* Code review --&gt; Peer review
</I>&gt;<i> * Giving teams credit for practiced MM-compliant activities will be
</I>&gt;<i> easier than mandating a single specific activity from each waterfall
</I>&gt;<i> process phase
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remember, SAMM doesn't prescribe particular activity. It presents a
</I>&gt;<i> menu from which organizations can chose a set providing desired
</I>&gt;<i> minimum coverage. ?Likewise, BSIMM observed a variety of activities,
</I>&gt;<i> each of which may or may not be suited to a particular org/culture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jim, wasn't there are push to do a SAMM-lite at some point? Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> that could be co-opted to be SAMM-agile.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From: JIM BIRD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem from a software development perspective is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maturity models and process frameworks are part of what Agile teams are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reacting against: ?process for process sake?, high-ceremony,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation-heavy, more time needed upfront, more time needed
</I>downstream. A
&gt;&gt;<i> good Agile or Lean software team is going to want to resist anything that
</I>doesn?t
&gt;&gt;<i> directly contribute to delivering working code to a customer quickly.
</I>This is
&gt;&gt;<i> taken to extremes with the latest fad of Continuous Deployment where
</I>developers run through their code through some automated tests and deploy
straight to
&gt;&gt;<i> production so that they can get immediate feedback. Suicide from a
</I>security (and
&gt;&gt;<i> reliability) point of view of course, but it shows how extreme some teams
</I>are
&gt;&gt;<i> taking these ideas.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don?t know too many Agile teams, even more responsible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones who don?t buy into Continuous Deployment, who are going to
</I>understand the
&gt;&gt;<i> point of a maturity model, or try to use one, even one as relatively
</I>simple as
&gt;&gt;<i> SAMM. And BSIMM is even more heavyweight, reasonably so since it is
</I>targeted to
&gt;&gt;<i> enterprises ? but at over 100 measurement areas it is too much for an
</I>Agile
&gt;&gt;<i> team to think about or try to work with. Take SAMM, which I am more
</I>familiar
&gt;&gt;<i> with. There is a lot of emphasis on governance, and strategy and policies
</I>and
&gt;&gt;<i> metrics and audits. This is not what an Agile organization is about.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even requirements and architecture are a hard sell ? as you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointed out James, assessing is about looking at documents, these models
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emphasize documents, and an Agile team is going to create only what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation is needed to get the job done. What matters to them is
</I>working
&gt;&gt;<i> closely with the customer and delivering code that meets the customer's
</I>needs. With an Agile team, you need other ways than looking at
&gt;&gt;<i> documentation to find evidence that the work is being done. So rather
</I>than
&gt;&gt;<i> asking whether something is documented or formally reviewed, it might be
</I>better
&gt;&gt;<i> to be able to ask the team questions that probe and verify their
</I>understanding of
&gt;&gt;<i> problems. For example in SAMM it asks under Design Review ?Do project
</I>teams
&gt;&gt;<i> document the attack perimeter of software designs?? Now, what is this
</I>question
&gt;&gt;<i> really asking? It?s not about whether something got written down ?
</I>writing it
&gt;&gt;<i> down doesn?t mean it gets dealt with. It?s asking whether the team
</I>understands
&gt;&gt;<i> the attack surface of what they are building and where the risk areas are
</I>and
&gt;&gt;<i> how they are going to handle them. So changing questions like this,
</I>questions that
&gt;&gt;<i> are clearly documentation check-marks, to get to the point behind the
</I>document might
&gt;&gt;<i> help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Adapting the maturity models to Agile is tough in other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cases because of the speed at which Agile teams move, the speed at which
</I>code
&gt;&gt;<i> is delivered. Look at something simple like pen testing. In SAMM it asks
</I>if pen
&gt;&gt;<i> testing is done prior to release. Well, if you are releasing every couple
</I>of
&gt;&gt;<i> weeks (or every day or even x times a day for some teams), what does this
</I>mean?
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It might make sense to come up with a compromise, in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same way that Microsoft has tried to adapt the SDL to come up with
</I>SDL-Agile. To
&gt;&gt;<i> identify the core practices that Agile teams should focus on, and
</I>recognize
&gt;&gt;<i> that there needs to be / should be some foundational practices and some
</I>practices
&gt;&gt;<i> that should be wrapped into sprints. In my experience managing small
</I>software
&gt;&gt;<i> teams, it makes sense to start with coding ? it?s all about the code. So
</I>for
&gt;&gt;<i> example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -?????????
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Education: people who write software like to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> training, as long as it is good training. So training on software
</I>security
&gt;&gt;<i> awareness and defensive programming is an easy sell. The team needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand software security first. Everybody. Including, and especially
</I>as Adrian
&gt;&gt;<i> Lane pointed out at OWASP AppSec this year, the Product Manager/Product
</I>Owner.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -?????????
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Code reviews and static analysis: a responsible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agile team cares about the quality of the code. So making sure that
</I>security
&gt;&gt;<i> checks are included in code reviews / pair programming makes sense (after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people have been trained so that they know what to look for). And any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responsible team is going to be following Continuous Integration. Adding
</I>static
&gt;&gt;<i> analysis to CI is relatively straightforward if you do it from the start.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Harder of course if you already have a lot of code in place. But the
</I>tools will
&gt;&gt;<i> help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is only a start of course: SDL-Agile is a good model to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reference, although a lot of teams, even teams that try hard, will fall
</I>short
&gt;&gt;<i> in key areas like threat modeling because of the costs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I?m afraid that at some point a maturity model doesn?t fit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Helping Agile organizations to get to level 1, to basic good practices
</I>and
&gt;&gt;<i> responsible awareness should be the goal. From there they should continue
</I>to
&gt;&gt;<i> improve themselves through the inspect-and-adapt cycle, with help from
</I>security
&gt;&gt;<i> experts as required. Asking Agile organizations to assess themselves
</I>against
&gt;&gt;<i> some model and move further up some ladder is essentially meaningless.
</I>It?s
&gt;&gt;<i> against how they work and the way that they think. It?s going back 20
</I>years to
&gt;&gt;<i> SEI CMM and CMMI maturity ladders that these people have already
</I>explicitly rejected.
&gt;&gt;<i> They?ve already found a different way that works better for them. It?s up
</I>to
&gt;&gt;<i> the security community to accept that and find ways to support it.
