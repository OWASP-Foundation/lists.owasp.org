<PRE>I like the notion of Agile Protection Poker as a substitute/replacement
for other artifacts and feel that it would be good of us to figure out
how to incorporate. Other recommendations include:

 

-          Misuse Stories

-          Helping auditors to understand that their notion of a risk
register may align with the agile concept of technical debt. Maybe
auditors can somehow slightly morph the notion of burndown to fit their
needs

-          Helping developers get credit for building test harnesses.
Even though defects remain, if you are attacked, having this in place is
actually a positive.

 

I wouldn't be a fan of having a SAMM-lite since the challenge described
is less about the ability for Agile teams to step up and more about the
ability for auditors to understand Agile approaches in this context.
Lighter audit criteria with all the levels of maturity could be both
good and bad.

Subject: Re: [SAMM] Agile Software Development

 

John,

Cool. I like your approach. As a manager of a software development
organization that needs to be both secure and agile, I appreciate this
kind of fair minded thinking and pragmatism. A couple of points:

1. We need more ways to help software teams build more secure software
without having to use the compliance/audit/governance stick. There are
lots of teams who are building software that needs to be more secure but
aren't subject to the kind of governance or audit requirements. Those
teams aren't going to understand a maturity model or use one, but they
still need to be helped somehow.

2. For those teams who are under the thumb of governance and audit, the
assessor's perspective will be critical here. For example, I thought
your example of using static analysis for XSS compliance was cool, and
it makes sense from an Agile perspective: if I can capture requirements
in automated tests (or something equivalent), this is a good thing.
James' comments show that not everybody will agree - and that's fair
too. If we try to build too much room in the assessment model, then as a
software developer I believe I have been responsible and I'm happily
going doing what I think is good work. And then an assessor comes by and
slams me. That would be sad. 

So maybe a SAMM lite / SAMM Agile is needed. What about BSIMM - will
there be a BSIMM-lite?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Code review not always the same as peer review. When 
</I>&gt;<i> looking at approaches such as XP where a team may be doing pair 
</I>&gt;<i> programming, there is no discrete &quot;event&quot; for an auditor to 
</I>&gt;<i> measure. Likewise, difficult for auditor to understand whether 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone is held to same standard (consistency)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Let's keep terminology clean when it comes to Agile and 
</I>&gt;<i> think about the notion of User Stories as a superset or control 
</I>&gt;<i> around enumerated requirements. User Stories can also have a 
</I>&gt;<i> security slant. User Stories are created by users/business 
</I>&gt;<i> customers while artifacts such as threat models tend to be 
</I>&gt;<i> created by IT types. If you look at how most shops operate, the 
</I>&gt;<i> user story is actually more important since it may actually 
</I>&gt;<i> cause the creation of requirements around it which in turn get 
</I>&gt;<i> tested by QA. Threat models while valuable rarely have the same 
</I>&gt;<i> effect or traceability characteristics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Static analysis can only identify issues that are 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;findable&quot; at coding time. Creating an artifact that late in the 
</I>&gt;<i> lifecycle is actually a suboptimal idea. Higher maturity is 
</I>&gt;<i> created if we can address security in an agile way at whatever 
</I>&gt;<i> feels like an architecture/design review. While this can't be 
</I>&gt;<i> automated, it can be done against a set of prescribed principles 
</I>&gt;<i> such as defense in depth, least privilege, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Many of the static analysis tools such as Ounce Labs, 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortify, etc can produce pretty dashboards articulating counts 
</I>&gt;<i> of highs, mediums, lows but doesn't provide the next step that 
</I>&gt;<i> would be truly valuable to an auditor which would be to align 
</I>&gt;<i> the findings with something like the OWASP Risk Rating method. I 
</I>&gt;<i> remember lots of painful conversations where there were 1000s of 
</I>&gt;<i> highs that resulted in low risk in one application where in 
</I>&gt;<i> another, there were 6 mediums and 1 low where it was possible to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: Re: [SAMM] Agile Software Development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jim,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Like James' email, it's hard to disagree with your points. Agile's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rows against process/governance are as predictable as in the 
</I>&gt;<i> reverse,&gt; for good reason.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The net is this: Agile teams can be opposed towards 
</I>&gt;<i> docs/process but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rarely do they have the skills, irreplaceability, and executive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support to completely inoculate themselves against all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; audit/governance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's why, with the experiences I shared, I tried to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> things in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the perspective of &quot;Agile teams got credit for [activity XXX], which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they were already doing&quot;. In cases where they weren't already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conducting the activity (or were doing so without a specific eye
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; towards security), it was painless to add.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The object, in my opinion, should be to make small changes to 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior&gt; that dramatically affect security outcomes, without 
</I>&gt;<i> having to change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development culture. Where Agile folk are doing good stuff, 
</I>&gt;<i> the push
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be to 'translate' this stuff into credit within the applied
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maturity model.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that rather than requirements, I mentioned misuse cases (very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; akin to user stories the teams already did).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rather than architecture, security toolkit reuse occurred and 
</I>&gt;<i> threats&gt; were identified (did I mention threats in my last 
</I>&gt;<i> email? That might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have been an omission)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've found neat use of static analysis to provide assurance 
</I>&gt;<i> cases too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rather than documenting requirements compliant with a policy teams
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have implemented custom rules that produce assurance that a security
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; toolkit was applied thoroughly across an application (in their 
</I>&gt;<i> Hudson&gt; build). When auditors come around and said, &quot;Hey, our 
</I>&gt;<i> policies say you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need requirements against XSS&quot; the team was able to respond,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;We don't do that. But! we did identify a need to protect 
</I>&gt;<i> against that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and our nightly builds' results show our commitment to that 
</I>&gt;<i> hygiene.&quot;&gt; Auditors needed to be trained to recognize that 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior as OK. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to gel with your experience as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The second net is this: organizations in which Agile and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process/audit/MM's coexist need to recognize that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Securing agile dev won't require special activities outside 
</I>&gt;<i> their MM's canon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Adjusting inputs/outputs/activities for agile teams may be 
</I>&gt;<i> more natural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * Code review --&gt; Peer review
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Giving teams credit for practiced MM-compliant activities 
</I>&gt;<i> will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier than mandating a single specific activity from each waterfall
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process phase
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Remember, SAMM doesn't prescribe particular activity. It 
</I>&gt;<i> presents a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; menu from which organizations can chose a set providing desired
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; minimum coverage.  Likewise, BSIMM observed a variety of activities,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each of which may or may not be suited to a particular org/culture.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jim, wasn't there are push to do a SAMM-lite at some point? Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that could be co-opted to be SAMM-agile.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; From: JIM BIRD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The problem from a software development perspective is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; maturity models and process frameworks are part of what Agile 
</I>&gt;<i> teams are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reacting against: ?process for process sake?, high-ceremony,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; documentation-heavy, more time needed upfront, more time 
</I>&gt;<i> needed downstream. A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; good Agile or Lean software team is going to want to resist 
</I>&gt;<i> anything that doesn?t
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; directly contribute to delivering working code to a customer 
</I>&gt;<i> quickly. This is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; taken to extremes with the latest fad of Continuous 
</I>&gt;<i> Deployment where developers run through their code through some 
</I>&gt;<i> automated tests and deploy straight to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; production so that they can get immediate feedback. Suicide 
</I>&gt;<i> from a security (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reliability) point of view of course, but it shows how 
</I>&gt;<i> extreme some teams are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; taking these ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don?t know too many Agile teams, even more responsible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ones who don?t buy into Continuous Deployment, who are going 
</I>&gt;<i> to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; point of a maturity model, or try to use one, even one as 
</I>&gt;<i> relatively simple as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; SAMM. And BSIMM is even more heavyweight, reasonably so since 
</I>&gt;<i> it is targeted to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; enterprises ? but at over 100 measurement areas it is too 
</I>&gt;<i> much for an Agile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; team to think about or try to work with. Take SAMM, which I 
</I>&gt;<i> am more familiar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with. There is a lot of emphasis on governance, and strategy 
</I>&gt;<i> and policies and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; metrics and audits. This is not what an Agile organization is 
</I>&gt;<i> about.&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Even requirements and architecture are a hard sell ? as you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; pointed out James, assessing is about looking at documents, 
</I>&gt;<i> these models
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; emphasize documents, and an Agile team is going to create 
</I>&gt;<i> only what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; documentation is needed to get the job done. What matters to 
</I>&gt;<i> them is working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; closely with the customer and delivering code that meets the 
</I>&gt;<i> customer's needs. With an Agile team, you need other ways than 
</I>&gt;<i> looking at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; documentation to find evidence that the work is being done. 
</I>&gt;<i> So rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; asking whether something is documented or formally reviewed, 
</I>&gt;<i> it might be better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to be able to ask the team questions that probe and verify 
</I>&gt;<i> their understanding of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; problems. For example in SAMM it asks under Design Review ?Do 
</I>&gt;<i> project teams
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; document the attack perimeter of software designs?? Now, what 
</I>&gt;<i> is this question
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; really asking? It?s not about whether something got written 
</I>&gt;<i> down ? writing it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; down doesn?t mean it gets dealt with. It?s asking whether the 
</I>&gt;<i> team understands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the attack surface of what they are building and where the 
</I>&gt;<i> risk areas are and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; how they are going to handle them. So changing questions like 
</I>&gt;<i> this, questions that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; are clearly documentation check-marks, to get to the point 
</I>&gt;<i> behind the document might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Adapting the maturity models to Agile is tough in other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; cases because of the speed at which Agile teams move, the 
</I>&gt;<i> speed at which code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is delivered. Look at something simple like pen testing. In 
</I>&gt;<i> SAMM it asks if pen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; testing is done prior to release. Well, if you are releasing 
</I>&gt;<i> every couple of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; weeks (or every day or even x times a day for some teams), 
</I>&gt;<i> what does this mean?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It might make sense to come up with a compromise, in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; same way that Microsoft has tried to adapt the SDL to come up 
</I>&gt;<i> with SDL-Agile. To
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; identify the core practices that Agile teams should focus on, 
</I>&gt;<i> and recognize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that there needs to be / should be some foundational 
</I>&gt;<i> practices and some practices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that should be wrapped into sprints. In my experience 
</I>&gt;<i> managing small software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; teams, it makes sense to start with coding ? it?s all about 
</I>&gt;<i> the code. So for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; -?????????
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Education: people who write software like to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; training, as long as it is good training. So training on 
</I>&gt;<i> software security
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; awareness and defensive programming is an easy sell. The team 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; understand software security first. Everybody. Including, and 
</I>&gt;<i> especially as Adrian
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Lane pointed out at OWASP AppSec this year, the Product 
</I>&gt;<i> Manager/Product Owner.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; -?????????
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Code reviews and static analysis: a responsible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Agile team cares about the quality of the code. So making 
</I>&gt;<i> sure that security
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; checks are included in code reviews / pair programming makes 
</I>&gt;<i> sense (after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; people have been trained so that they know what to look for). 
</I>&gt;<i> And any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; responsible team is going to be following Continuous 
</I>&gt;<i> Integration. Adding static
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; analysis to CI is relatively straightforward if you do it 
</I>&gt;<i> from the start.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Harder of course if you already have a lot of code in place. 
</I>&gt;<i> But the tools will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This is only a start of course: SDL-Agile is a good model to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reference, although a lot of teams, even teams that try hard, 
</I>&gt;<i> will fall short
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in key areas like threat modeling because of the costs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But I?m afraid that at some point a maturity model doesn?t fit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Helping Agile organizations to get to level 1, to basic good 
</I>&gt;<i> practices and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; responsible awareness should be the goal. From there they 
</I>&gt;<i> should continue to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; improve themselves through the inspect-and-adapt cycle, with 
</I>&gt;<i> help from security
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; experts as required. Asking Agile organizations to assess 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some model and move further up some ladder is essentially 
</I>&gt;<i> meaningless. It?s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; against how they work and the way that they think. It?s going 
</I>&gt;<i> back 20 years to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; SEI CMM and CMMI maturity ladders that these people have 
</I>&gt;<i> already explicitly rejected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; They?ve already found a different way that works better for 
</I>&gt;<i> them. It?s up to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the security community to accept that and find ways to 
</I>&gt;<i> support it.
