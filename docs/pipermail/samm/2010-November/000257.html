<PRE>I think the point I was intending to make was to say that an auditor can
observe the event, but still has no ability to understand quality/depth
of review and am asking whether the reviewer should be held to some
standard before the auditor can check the box?

My example of outsourcing can too be applied to Agile environments.
Business context is usually gained during Agile Project Management
approaches such as Scrum, Kanban, Crystal, etc. However, you can do
Agile Software Development without Agile Project Management. For
example, I can do Extreme Programming where we build test cases first
without using any Project Management Lifecycle. Generally speaking,
auditors tend to understand more on how to audit Project Management
oriented processes and not how to audit software development oriented
practices. SDLC is too overloaded a term and may need a little bit of
decomposition in order to help SAMM align with other models.

Now for a more general question, should we figure out a way to refine
the phrase &quot;static analysis&quot;? In the context most OWASP members would
interpret can differ from static analysis as used for quality assurance
purposes. Sometimes security and quality are the same, sometimes they
are different. Providing some form of lens to see the Venn diagram
between these two may be useful?

-----------------
1. If we believe that the someone in the process that provides Software
Security Assurance, do we also believe this individual should be
separate
from the development team? PCI seems to think so. Do you know that I
tell my
son's to review all of my code before they get to go to Chuck e.
Cheeses?
Care to guess how quickly my code gets reviewed? NOTE: The nine year old
has
already found uses for WebScarab in changing parms for the games he
plays.

RKF :  To your first question, the answer is yes, but the spectrum can
be
from informal to very formal depending on where you are in the maturity
model and what your business is.  There are many models for defining
each
level, but it usually ends up that the highest level is national
security.
Most businesses are several levels below that.

RKF:  As far as the rest of the text, not sure what point you are trying
to
make.  But I think the point that should be made is kids are smart and
absorb things like sponges so we should make sure they understand the
issue
of security:  not that horrible things can happen (which you and I know
can)
but undesirable things may happen so you should protect yourself.

2. We shouldn't assume that the developers even understand business
context.
Think about the throw it over the wall model better known as
outsourcing.
They are given &quot;instructions&quot; such as put widget X on page Y without any
additional context or participation from above (us US-based enterprisey
types)

RKF:  I think this is an issue set apart from security.  Most
organizations
I have worked with, the developers do understand the business context.
To
your point, if it is outsourced to a commodity shop, then yes, business
context is the first order of business before you can begin to address
security.
