<PRE>Hi,

 

The point of Rugged is to make appsec into something that developers
*want* to know and practice.  In my experience, organizations that have
achieved this mindset have dramatically more successful programs.
Programs that primarily focus on making developers feel bad are doomed
to failure.

 

I respectfully suggest that changing the culture and the mindset of an
organization is a critical component of an appsec maturity model. There
are certainly activities and processes that can be put in place to help
achieve this.  If that's something you'd like to work on in SAMM, I'm
ready to help.

 

--Jeff

Rugged is devoid of content, there is nothing in it to apply to the SAMM
framework.

&gt;<i> Questions/Thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * We have all heard of the Rugged Software Manifesto as being
</I>&gt;<i> championed by Jeff Williams. Does being Rugged bring out any new
</I>&gt;<i> categories that should be included in SAMM?
</I>&gt;<i> * SAMM now has various flavors of assessment worksheets that an
</I>&gt;<i> auditor can use. In sharing this with our local ISACA chapter, I did
</I>&gt;<i> note that many auditors do not come from a software development
</I>&gt;<i> background. Many auditors in fact tend to be CPA's by trade. So, with
</I>&gt;<i> this thought in mind should there be a separate category for audit
</I>&gt;<i> maturity?
</I>&gt;<i> * We need to have some guidance outlining scope of audit as placed
</I>&gt;<i> against an organizational structure. For example, it is possible 
</I>&gt;<i> for a
</I>&gt;<i> department within a company to be CMMI certified vs the entire 
</I>&gt;<i> company. 
</I>&gt;<i> * OWASP is somewhat sensitive to the usage of its logo, but I
</I>&gt;<i> would think that if some enterprise wanted to publish its 
</I>&gt;<i> maturity level
</I>&gt;<i> publicly, we should provide guidance within this context
