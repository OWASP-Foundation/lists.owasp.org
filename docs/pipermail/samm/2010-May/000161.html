<PRE>I fully agree with Jim. If you can't proactively get security right,
then you are heavily reliant on after-the-fact forensics in which log
review is vital. Gunnar Peterson actually has a course on this very
subject (inspired by his most favorite enterprise). With web services
and other distributed approaches, an appication isn't just comprised of
one log and therefore we need to figure out things around correlation,
ACLs, tamper evidence, etc to be mentioned somewhere.

SAMM has the potential to be a huge hit in the audit community, so maybe
we start talking about what forensic capabilities are needed
operationally?

Subject: [SAMM] Operational Security?

I'm a little perplexed with SAMM's take on operation (appsec based)
security.

For example, I see &quot;code signing&quot; as a measurement under &quot;Operational
Enablement&quot; but do not see &quot;Centralized Application Security Event
Logging&quot; or &quot;Solid Incident Response Capabilities&quot; or other aspects of
operation security that I would expect to see under the &quot;Operational
Enablement&quot; section. Am I missing something here?

Thanks - I really think SAMM is a powerful body of work and I'd like to
help be a part of the next release.
