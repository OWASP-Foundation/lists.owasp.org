<PRE>I think Jim is saying that Rugged needs to build out its content in
order to be truly valuable. Right now, it is somewhat lightweight and
would be hard to cross-reference to SAMM. I agree with Jeff that
maturity needs to account for deliberate steps that are required in
order to change a culture. Maybe we have a 13th section labeled
&quot;Software Assurance Leadership&quot; where we can enumerate the rugged
aspects?
 
Some of the things that I think should be explored are:
 

*	
	Does the organization have a budget that is driven more by
compliance to various regs (aka auditor-driven) or do they have one that
starts with risks (aka security-driven) disclaimer: somewhat abstract
*	
	Does the notion of security rest on a single IT sponsor or are
there multiple &quot;keepers of the flame&quot;
*	
	How future-focused is security? Is it is only supported by
funding or is it verbally and frequently championed by executives
*	
	Does the culture provide monetary rewards for individuals who
aspire to be rugged or is it solely driven by who brings in the donuts
(aka perception management)
*	
	Do they view training as an employee benefit? (bad)
*	
	Are courses that enable developers to write better working
software (regardless of security) labeled as optional; where employees
are not expected to attend.
*	
	Do organizations have conference and external training budgets?
Are organizations actually expecting to spend it?
*	
	Executives take the personal development of their employees
seriously above and beyond what the HR hype says?
*	
	Does the organization encourage their people to share their
knowledge outside of the organization? (Teaching others helps one
understand the subject area better)
*	
	Remediating insecure code does not provide additional business
capabilities. How do they align with business drivers while also
guaranteeing sound security posture? Is this one-sided?
*	
	Is there a common language for describing security risk to the
business? What is the track record of the business community in wanting
to understand?
*	
	Can the organization sustain their security velocity
indefinetely?
*	
	If a developer knows about security defects within an
application. Are they encouraged to expose to business and have a direct
conversation, to exercise their right to remain silent, record it in the
bug tracking system with all the other bugs that we never get to, etc

Sorry for the misc ramblings...

Hi,

 

The point of Rugged is to make appsec into something that developers
*want* to know and practice.  In my experience, organizations that have
achieved this mindset have dramatically more successful programs.
Programs that primarily focus on making developers feel bad are doomed
to failure.

 

I respectfully suggest that changing the culture and the mindset of an
organization is a critical component of an appsec maturity model. There
are certainly activities and processes that can be put in place to help
achieve this.  If that's something you'd like to work on in SAMM, I'm
ready to help.

 

--Jeff

Rugged is devoid of content, there is nothing in it to apply to the SAMM
framework.

&gt;<i> Questions/Thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * We have all heard of the Rugged Software Manifesto as being
</I>&gt;<i> championed by Jeff Williams. Does being Rugged bring out any new
</I>&gt;<i> categories that should be included in SAMM?
</I>&gt;<i> * SAMM now has various flavors of assessment worksheets that an
</I>&gt;<i> auditor can use. In sharing this with our local ISACA chapter, I did
</I>&gt;<i> note that many auditors do not come from a software development
</I>&gt;<i> background. Many auditors in fact tend to be CPA's by trade. So, with
</I>&gt;<i> this thought in mind should there be a separate category for audit
</I>&gt;<i> maturity?
</I>&gt;<i> * We need to have some guidance outlining scope of audit as placed
</I>&gt;<i> against an organizational structure. For example, it is possible 
</I>&gt;<i> for a
</I>&gt;<i> department within a company to be CMMI certified vs the entire 
</I>&gt;<i> company. 
</I>&gt;<i> * OWASP is somewhat sensitive to the usage of its logo, but I
</I>&gt;<i> would think that if some enterprise wanted to publish its 
</I>&gt;<i> maturity level
</I>&gt;<i> publicly, we should provide guidance within this context
