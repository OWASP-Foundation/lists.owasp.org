<PRE>Questions/Thoughts:

*	We have all heard of the Rugged Software Manifesto as being
championed by Jeff Williams. Does being Rugged bring out any new
categories that should be included in SAMM?
*	SAMM now has various flavors of assessment worksheets that an
auditor can use. In sharing this with our local ISACA chapter, I did
note that many auditors do not come from a software development
background. Many auditors in fact tend to be CPA's by trade. So, with
this thought in mind should there be a separate category for audit
maturity?
*	We need to have some guidance outlining scope of audit as placed
against an organizational structure. For example, it is possible for a
department within a company to be CMMI certified vs the entire company. 
*	OWASP is somewhat sensitive to the usage of its logo, but I
would think that if some enterprise wanted to publish its maturity level
publicly, we should provide guidance within this context
