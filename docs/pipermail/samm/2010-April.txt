Hi all,

We just released a Japanese translation of SAMM 1.0 which you can
download from: 

 http://www.jpcert.or.jp/research/2010/SAMM_20100407.pdf

I suppose Pravir is preparing OWASP official translations for multiple languages
and ours will be incorporated into one of them. Meanwhile, Japanese readers
can get the document from there.

Thanks Pravir and OWASP for making such a good document under CC.

Nice work, Rohit! I definitely like the auditor "flavor" to the language you
used and I think it resonates well with the few folks I've showed it to.

As I was reading through it, I couldn't help but think that we should add a
something to help an auditor map it back to a SAMM scorecard. Have you
thought about that at all?

It's certainly not a requirement for any audit framework, but since an
organization can strive to achieve a level less than 3, they should be able
to easily tailor the audit framework to check for only the controls that are
appropriate. That being said, sometimes the SAMM activities don't directly
correspond to the traditional notion of a "control" so that might be tricky.
Just curious about your thoughts.

Thanks!

Lots of interesting points to consider, James. The main one that I've run
into is when an organization does a lot of outsourced development. SAMM was
built with focus on in-house dev, so this case presents a bit of a hiccup
for application of the model.

For the in-house stuff, SAMM basically works out of the box. For the
outsourced stuff, I've recommended that clients focus on the Verification
practices and activities, to which I also added a few others cherry-picked
from the other business functions.

I'm curious as to what other folks see as the "right way" for firms to
handle and control outsourced dev? A close corollary is COTS... the mic is
open on that one too :)

Wow, these look remarkably close to the ones from the doc! And, with XML for
the input to boot.... awesome! How's it progressing these days?

That's a good question - I haven't really mapped the controls back to
SAMM, and that has to do with the points you raised in your second
paragraph.

Some of the controls, specifically around aligning security activities
to business, are more about strategic alignment and cost control than
necessarily reducing the total quantity of vulnerabilities. External
auditors are really interested in risk reduction.

I'm not so sure that means that an external auditor only cares about
verification / deployment activities. I know that if an outsourced
vendor includes secure requirements/design/architecture then there
will be fewer inherent vulnerabilities in the application itself and
less time spent on remediation. Good governance & education will also
likely mean fewer vulnerabilities which decreases the risk of
vulnerabilities slipping through the verification steps.

My take is that it should be the auditor's discretion to take the
results of the audit and provide an overall "health" rating. When we
used this audit framework, we did provide the overall SAMM maturity
ratings for what we assessed. People are probably more concerned with
how they compare to other organizations in their industry.

Cool, I think we're on the same page. I definitely agree on the point of
auditor's discretion for overall rating of "health". And from the clients
I've worked with, almost all are mainly interested in how they compare to
their competitors in their vertical. In fact, I'm working on getting a few
SAMM scorecard vectors based on collected data right now, so hopefully we'll
have something interesting to share in the next month or so.

If you're going to outsource to a 3rd party for anything important (based on
information classification and risk) you're likely to go through a due
diligence process of some sorts. If that outsourcing agreement is in the
form of software development I wouldn't see it as too difficult to include
the SAMM questions. Due diligence often starts as a simple questionnaire,
it's up to the business to make the determination on how much of what the
3rd party says actually needs to be verified. For example, "Does your
organization understand and document the types of attackers it faces?", you
could follow that up with asking to review one of these documents, or the
procedures that document this process.

I mean I also agree the model fits more snuggly with inhouse development,
but it's not completely lost on 3rd parties.

Christian, that due diligence process is exactly the need we intend to
serve with the questionnaire we're discussing. I'd be happy to hear if
other people are successful using it in that context

Yes they are meant to fake your DTP work!  BL is reviewing my XSL and

Subject: [SAMM] Likelihood of achieving a Level 0+ even though activities in
	higher brackets are achieved
Message-ID: <t2g42a22871004192012u1f238f1ahbf97fd938de3772b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

A friend of mine who was having a play with the SAMM Excel assessment
scorecard asked me a pretty question and I thought maybe I should bounce it
off you guys to confirm the scoring logic.

His use case was what if within the Deployment -> Operational Enablement you
had the following responses:
--
Do you deliver security notes with the majority of software releases? No
Are security-related alerts and error conditions documented for most
projects? No
--
Are most projects utilizing a change management process that's well
understood? Yes
Do project teams deliver an operational security guide with each product
release? Yes
--
....

My understanding of the levels would be that this would score a "0+". I
guess his concerns were what if you did everything except for a single
activity in the 0-1 range, you would still only score a "0+". I believe the
likelihood of this occurring to be low, given that most of the activities
have dependencies on previous activities, but I just wanted to ask the
question and see what you thought?

Regards,

Christian

This question has popped up a few times. You're correct in thinking that
should be scored a 0+, in general. But in this situation, I think the
presence of the "operational security guide with each product release"
(level 2 activity) would subsume the level 1 activities, right? Meaning, if
you're actually delivering security guides, then you also are delivering the
security notes and details of alerts and error conditions. Or am I missing
something?

No I believe you're correct, and that's the response I've given. It's not
very likely that you would be delivering items further up the assessment
without having delivering earlier activities.

I think in a real world situation you wouldn't often run into this
conditions, but it's hard to say as I'm only starting to go through this at
my organisation at the moment.

Thank you for your comments Pravir.

Regards,

Christian

No problem. These are always good points to discuss when they come up.
Just 2 days ago, I had a client with the same situation, but with the
Code Review practice. It's always good to flag these kinds of things
since there might be some nuance of the activity that we can massage
in later releases.

Hey Everyone.

I have been talking about it for a while, but I finally sat down and
wrestled through the process of generating an XML file with all the SAMM
content. Well, almost all the content... I left out the case study at the
end.

Lots of people have been asking for it since it really streamlines
translation work as well as making big opportunities for incorporating the
model into automation tools.

If you have interested and a few minutes to kill, take a look and proofread
the xml layout to make sure I didn't make any errors in tagging the content
(though the content itself is identical to the PDF, so no need to proof-read
that part unless you want to).

If it all looks good in a few days, I'll post it up on the site. I also want
to add a "resources" section to the site, but more on that under separate
cover.

Hey Everyone.

Over the last year or so, a few folks have sent resources and templates
based on the model to this list (and to me directly). I want to identify all
those gems and wrangle up to the website since trolling this lists archives
is a pain. Just to be sure I haven't missed anything, I pasted my list
below. If there's anything I'm missing, please do speak up!

 * Nick Coblentz - SAMM Assessment Interview Template (xls/googledoc)
 * Christian Frichot - SAMM Assessment Spreadsheet (xls)
 * Colin Watson - Roadmap Chart Template (xls)
 * Jim Weiler - MS Project Plan Template (mpp)

Thanks.

Looks good Pravir.

I have to admit I haven't trolled the list enough to see either Colin or
Jim's work so I'm looking forward to having a look soon :)

Regards,

Christian

Pravir

I think the newer (not quite ready) SVG roadmap charts would be better
than the XLS one.

Ahh, got it. How's that progressing by the way? What's left to do?
Anything folks on the list have cycles to help with?
