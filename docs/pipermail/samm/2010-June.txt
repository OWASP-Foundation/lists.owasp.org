SAMM list

OWASP was asked to work with the European Network and Information
Security Agency (ENISA) on the development of its common assurance
metrics project.  They will be a maturity model or some type of
assessment framework for third party providers of services (e.g. cloud
computing).  We were initially asked to extract relevant security
controls from six existing standards (see below) for their
"development sub-domain".  However, we have also tried to aggregate
all the "controls" from SAMM, BSIMM and SAFECode's guidance to better
reflect software development best practices.  The current draft list
is at:

  http://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Camm-controls-itservices-development-20100604o.xls

We expect some of these controls may be merged, split, made more
generic or removed.  There is also a high degree of overlap with other
"domains" in the proposed framework - especially governance,
operations, incident management and business continuity - and there
will be further discussion of these in due course.

The OWASP effort is being discussed via the OWASP Cloud 10 list:

The list of relevant controls for the IT Services - Development
sub-domain has been posted at:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Camm-controls-itservices-development-20100604o.xls

This draws on security controls listed in:

- Clouds Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix
- ENISA Information Assurance Framework
- COBIT v4.1
- ISO/IEC 27001
- ITIL (Best Practice for Application Management)
- PCIDSS v1.2

and an aggregated list from:

- SAMM v1
- BSIMM v2
- SAFECode

I saw a link to a survey about secure software development by the
Oxford Internet Institute:

   http://limesurvey.oii.ox.ac.uk/index.php?sid=86911%3C=en

It mentions Microsoft SDL on the first page (of many). I have emailed
Prof. Mingqiu Song to ask whether SAMM has been considered in the
research.

Hi there,
As a non.native English speaker, I have a very basic question: is it
grammaticaly correct to say 'software secure development'?

I think it's meant to be "secure software development", but one of the
Ss could be "system(s)" rather than "software".  There are a few other
grammatical issues through the survey.

Your data XML file is a requirement for our SVG roadmaps.  Would it
maybe be possible to announce SAMM-1.0-XML-0.3-en_US.xml via the blog
and add it is a download on owasp.org and/or opensamm.org?
