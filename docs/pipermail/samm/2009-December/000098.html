<PRE>So, I think this answers what they need to know in terms of a body of
knowledge. Looking for insight into how it would feel. Would it feel
like an Enterprise PMO or more like an Agile Coach, ScrumMaster?

Hi 
My exp of samm would dictate;
 
Regarding a process weeine this actually helps, experience in
interviewing (audit interviews) and getting to an accurate answer us
very important. Someone with SDLC security and
with 27001 exposure would be great at the job.
SDLC experience (From secure dev to change control to awareness and
training rollout etc) is important and also knowledge of the industry
being audited; this helps with developing a roadmap and what to focus
on.

	If a large enterprise wanted to annoint an individual to rollout
SAMM, what would the job description look like? What are some of the
characteristics this individual would need in order to be successful?
Could they be successful in being a process weenie alone or is something
else required? Do they need to know how to program? Do they need to know
about project/program management?
