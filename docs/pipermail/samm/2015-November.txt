Hi Guys,

I'm done porting the quick start guide to the SSDLC Cheat sheet.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_SDLC_Cheat_Sheet


There is two comments I have on the Quick Start guide:

1. Step 2 - Resources refers to the "The OpenSAMM Toolbox" with a wrong
link: http://LINK (we need to change it on the doc as well as the wiki
page).
2. Step 6 - Has a spelling mistake: trainings - should be training (English
is my second language so let me know if this is actually correct or not).


If there are any comments or suggestions let me know.

Regards,

Mike Bester

Subject: [SAMM] Assessment worksheet

Guys and Gals,

I am looking at OpenSAMM as a basis for a security assurance framework and was going through the assessment worksheet.? Is the intention that the questions be answered only with respect to security or with respect to software development in general?

Let me show by some examples,

This one is clear to me

???? "Is there a software security assurance program already in place?"
???? 
???? My answer to this one is a clear, "No"

This one seems ambigous,

???? "Does the organization use a set of policies and standards to control software development?"

???? For security the answer would be, "No" (I assume this is the right one), 
???? but for software development in general the answer would be, "Yes"

Sorry for the newb question, but don't want to waste time by starting off on the wrong footing.

I think the intention of that question would be in the context of security regarding the policy and in regards to conforming to standards as it relates to software dev. In the latter it is important for functionality as well as security for things like forensics so it isn't so Wild West.

Just my opinion

Yes, the question "Does the organization use a set of policies and
standards to control software development?" is just that.

It's looking for the level of maturity the development org has, if you have
policies and standards for software dev (essentially a SDLC) then answer
"Yes".
Basically if you don't have this, you are going to have a hard time
building secure software (embedding security into development lifecycle).

Thanks,
Brian

hi,

A topic to be discussed during the opensamm call this evening.

Our OpenSAMM project currently has $10,484.1 budget available.
What will we use this on?
I can think of:
1) seeding funds for organizing a SAMM Summit next year
2) printing hard copies of SAMM v1.1 for chapters / conferences
3) fund an OpenSAMM roadshow in Europe and/or the US?
4) editor/artwork costs for SAMM v2
5) website redesign

Other ideas/suggestions are welcome!

kind regards

Seba






I started working through the budget and have a few ideas that could help
other chapters.

1. Can we get the Transaction Report and Budget Balance report in a
spreadsheet format?
That way I can easily total up last year's average income from membership
per month, add a modifier and use this for 2016 estimations. I can do the
same with chapter supporters.

2. It's unclear which cells the author should edit and which are formulas
that should be untouched. Perhaps shade all cells that should be edited a
particular color.

3. Rows 9 and 10 seem like they should have formulas, but don't. Perhaps
that's an error?

Otherwise makes a lot of sense. I think the above items will help a lot for
chapters as they fill this out.

hi Michael,

this looks great!
Once we publish the samm v1.1 you can link the specific pointers in the
cheat sheet.
(this includes the missing LINK as you mentioned).

On the typo - you are right, training sounds better (although trainings can
formally be used for training in plural, but it is weird).

regards

Seba

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bni3mWHM3wNcX8HpRVIcg5nRoe6Jos8k6Qqlr297PUY/edit

next call will be in 1 or 2 weeks depending on the availability of the core
model v1.1 for public review.

other major topic is the next SAMM Summit, we discussed having this in New
York end of April 2016 and will try to fix a venue / date in the coming
weeks

regards

Seba

hi,

latest status - the core model v1.1 is at the designer for the last
modifications. We hope to share this with you in the coming days.

for the rest no updates, so no reason for a call today.

kind regards

Seba
