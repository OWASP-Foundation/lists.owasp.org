I had a look through the XML.... I'm sure this is going to be very
helpful.  Two small queries

1.  The Security Practices e.g. <security-practice number="1" id="SM">
don't seem to reference which Business Function they relate to.

2.  In the Executive Summary and Understanding the Model - Business
Functions there are references to charts and diagrams e.g. "see
diagram below", "listed below" and "listed opposite".  Should these be
removed or could links be added to images elsewhere?

Regards

For #1, I agree... I forgot to link that up. I'll add a "parent- 
function" attr with a link to the related biz function.

For #2, it's a little tricky. I can't really replace the content that  
says things like "see diagram below" since there's not an easy way to  
do that with the workflow I'm using for the layout, etc. But, I can  
tag the related graphics so that they appear as entities in the XML  
("image" nodes or something like that).  They would have (as a  
"source" attr) a relative link to the image file in a subdir.  
Ultimately, this would mean the XML version would be a zip containing  
the XML file of core content along with a subdir of all the exported  
images. Would that address the need?

Hi Pravir,

Is there a section that defines the maturity levels?   I couldn't find one in the XML.  If not, would you be willing to add one?  I was hoping the data part would look something like this, but feel free to rearrange & rename the attributes & elements to suit.  Basically, I'm looking for a place that translates OpenSAMM's human-friendly values like 0+ to graph-friendly values like 0.5.

<levels>
    <level id="0">0</level>
    <level id="0+">0.5</level>
    <level id="1">1</level>
    <level id="1+">1.5</level>
    <level id="2">2</level>
    <level id="2+">2.5</level>
    <level id="3">3</level>
    <level id="3+">3.5</level> 
</levels>

Apart from sounding like a lot of work, I'm sure that would address
this.  On reflection, if we just treat it as "the text", there would
be no need to do any more, and that might be easier to maintain in the
future.

Could you confirm if this new attribute will contain the function's
NUMBER or its ID? (With Brenda's help we are going to use some
information from your XML file in the roadmap SVG conversions.)

<business-function number="4" id="deployment">

Ok, I made the following updates:
 * @colin: Added references to "security-practice" nodes
("business-function" attr referring to the "id" of the "business-function"
node)
 * @brenda: Added "level-data" node with "level-value" children to map the
level's in prose (the "id" attr) to the levels in graphs (the "value" attr)

For the images one, I decided not to do it because frankly, as Colin
suggested, it is a lot of work to set it up for now and it'll make life a
lot harder as we add more languages (I'm laying out a Spanish translation
now and it would definitely cause a long-term headache).

Let me know how this one works out for you and the graphing project. Thanks!

You're right - it has almost turned into a mini project!  Brenda is
pulling the practice names from your SAMM XML file.. so it should work
with (some) other languages.  We also almost have an XSD schema for
the XML data files.  Part 2 seems to be SVG for scorecard charts :-)

Hope you all are well. 

 

We are looking for a trainer to deliver the Software

be held in London, May, 28th.

As you may know, this event is our first attempt to institutionalize an
OWASP training model.  In conceptual terms, we are proposing a Chapters
driven model with local Chapter organization in which the courses are free
for OWASP members, the contents are OWASP projects focused and the costs are
supported by a mix of funding i.e. local chapter budget, external
sponsorship, trainers sponsorship i.e. trip and/or accommodation paid by
themselves and local chapter members' sponsorship i.e. taking trainers in as
guests.  

 

That being said, if you feel comfortable enough to teach SAMM and have the
will and the spare cycles to give us a hand, please drop me a line.

 

Additionally, in terms of financial framework, for budget reasons we will
give preference to a voluntary/candidate currently living in the United
Kingdom and, in accordance with what is above being said, the OWASP London
Chapter will assume the flight cost and will either find an OWASP Member to
host the chosen voluntary or will pay his accommodation.

 

For now that's all. I thank you for reading this long text. Please do not
hesitate and get back to me if you feel I can clarify anything less clear in
our current invitation.

 

I thank you in advance, best regards,

Subject: [SAMM] Operational Security?
Message-ID: <4BF46757.4010407@owasp.org>

I'm a little perplexed with SAMM's take on operation (appsec based) 
security.

For example, I see "code signing" as a measurement under "Operational 
Enablement" but do not see "Centralized Application Security Event 
Logging" or "Solid Incident Response Capabilities" or other aspects of 
operation security that I would expect to see under the "Operational 
Enablement" section. Am I missing something here?

Thanks - I really think SAMM is a powerful body of work and I'd like to 
help be a part of the next release.

Jim

A good question, and it might be useful to add these somewhere (the
wiki?) as a list of topics to be considered, so we don't lose the
information?

I'm working with Vinay and Shankar as on:

    ENISA Common Assurance Maturity Model (name changed from wiki page URL)
    http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:ENISA_Cloud_Computing_Common_Assurance_Metrics

ENISA/CAM have asked the OWASP contributors to work on the "software
development" sub-domain to identify security controls.  Specifically
they are interested what's in CSA docs, ENISA IAF, ISO 27001, ITIL,
COBIT and PCIDSS, but we're tryinmg to use SAMM with SafeCODE and
BSIMM to get greater coverage.  These other "standards" do address
some operational issues more widely.  But I wonder if anyone has done
any work identifying the overlap between SAMM and these, especially
BSIMM(2)?

I fully agree with Jim. If you can't proactively get security right,
then you are heavily reliant on after-the-fact forensics in which log
review is vital. Gunnar Peterson actually has a course on this very
subject (inspired by his most favorite enterprise). With web services
and other distributed approaches, an appication isn't just comprised of
one log and therefore we need to figure out things around correlation,
ACLs, tamper evidence, etc to be mentioned somewhere.

SAMM has the potential to be a huge hit in the audit community, so maybe
we start talking about what forensic capabilities are needed
operationally?

When I applied SAMM to my organization, I did find the Operational Enablement practice area hard to follow but I was new to the model and finding my way at the time. I understood Operational Enablement to address documentation and procedures specific to the application and how it is configured and how it needs to be run and maintained. 

As you point out, why is "code signing" a level 3 Operational Enablement
 activity - shouldn't "code signing" be considered under Environment 
Hardening rather than Operational Enablement? 

Your question about event logging is also good. There is a requirement to "Document procedures for typical application alerts" as a level 1 OE activity, but there should be more within Operational Enablement to ensure proper log management and archival, correlation and reviews, forensics and so on. 

The tie-ins between Operational Enablement, Environment Hardening and Vulnerability Management need to be reviewed and clarified. I think the "Solid Incident Response Capabilities" which you are looking for in Operational Enablement is addressed under the Vulnerability Management practice, not Operational Enablement, for example.

Questions/Thoughts:

categories that should be included in SAMM?
*	SAMM now has various flavors of assessment worksheets that an
auditor can use. In sharing this with our local ISACA chapter, I did
note that many auditors do not come from a software development
background. Many auditors in fact tend to be CPA's by trade. So, with
this thought in mind should there be a separate category for audit
maturity?
*	We need to have some guidance outlining scope of audit as placed
against an organizational structure. For example, it is possible for a
department within a company to be CMMI certified vs the entire company. 
*	OWASP is somewhat sensitive to the usage of its logo, but I
would think that if some enterprise wanted to publish its maturity level
publicly, we should provide guidance within this context

Hi,

 

The point of Rugged is to make appsec into something that developers
*want* to know and practice.  In my experience, organizations that have
achieved this mindset have dramatically more successful programs.
Programs that primarily focus on making developers feel bad are doomed
to failure.

 

I respectfully suggest that changing the culture and the mindset of an
organization is a critical component of an appsec maturity model. There
are certainly activities and processes that can be put in place to help
achieve this.  If that's something you'd like to work on in SAMM, I'm
ready to help.

I think Jim is saying that Rugged needs to build out its content in
order to be truly valuable. Right now, it is somewhat lightweight and
would be hard to cross-reference to SAMM. I agree with Jeff that
maturity needs to account for deliberate steps that are required in
order to change a culture. Maybe we have a 13th section labeled
"Software Assurance Leadership" where we can enumerate the rugged
aspects?
 
Some of the things that I think should be explored are:
 

*	
	Does the organization have a budget that is driven more by
compliance to various regs (aka auditor-driven) or do they have one that
starts with risks (aka security-driven) disclaimer: somewhat abstract
*	
	Does the notion of security rest on a single IT sponsor or are
there multiple "keepers of the flame"
*	
	How future-focused is security? Is it is only supported by
funding or is it verbally and frequently championed by executives
*	
	Does the culture provide monetary rewards for individuals who
aspire to be rugged or is it solely driven by who brings in the donuts
(aka perception management)
*	
	Do they view training as an employee benefit? (bad)
*	
	Are courses that enable developers to write better working
software (regardless of security) labeled as optional; where employees
are not expected to attend.
*	
	Do organizations have conference and external training budgets?
Are organizations actually expecting to spend it?
*	
	Executives take the personal development of their employees
seriously above and beyond what the HR hype says?
*	
	Does the organization encourage their people to share their
knowledge outside of the organization? (Teaching others helps one
understand the subject area better)
*	
	Remediating insecure code does not provide additional business
capabilities. How do they align with business drivers while also
guaranteeing sound security posture? Is this one-sided?
*	
	Is there a common language for describing security risk to the
business? What is the track record of the business community in wanting
to understand?
*	
	Can the organization sustain their security velocity
indefinetely?
*	
	If a developer knows about security defects within an
application. Are they encouraged to expose to business and have a direct
conversation, to exercise their right to remain silent, record it in the
bug tracking system with all the other bugs that we never get to, etc

Sorry for the misc ramblings...
