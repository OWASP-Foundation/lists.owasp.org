Kevin,
Do you have an example you can share?
Right now in the Roadmap tab, the four phases are not defaulting to the
interview value, so if the Interview answer is higher than the current
answers in the future phases it can show a decline in scoring.

The intention with the Roadmap tab is to project the answer for security
practices in future phases.
This is the first iteration and it is largely a manual process at the
moment.
Answers for each of the phases will need to be set based on projects and
initiatives underway, sometimes the answers will stay the same and some
times they should change (for better or worse).

If you look at the phases for the security practices in question, do the
answers in future phases show in red?
If so they just need to be adjusted to align with the answered question if
they aren't truly degrading.

I considered reseting all the phase answers to match the interview answer
any time it changes, but I didn't want to mess up projections that people
didn't intend to change.  I didn't want to get into complicated logic in
Excel so I didn't implement changing defaults, that's something that will
likely be done in a webapp in the future.

Please let me know if that answers your question or not.

Thanks,
Brian

To: OWASP Leaders <owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>


Dear all,

### OWASP Summit 2017 Announcement

*OWASP Summit 2017 - join us!*

It's now official, the next OWASP Summit will happen in *London/England
between 12 and 16 of June 2017* (date chosen using a Doodle
<http://doodle.com/poll/e8d4p955rc8guuru> with 73 participants).

The event will be hosted at CenterParcs Woburn
<http://events.centerparcs.co.uk/woburn-forest-overview/index.html>, we
have already booked the first block of 10 villas and meeting rooms.

This will be a working Summit  based on the model used at the 2008
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2008> and 2011
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011> Summits in Portugal,
basically daily 18 hours of sessions on Application Security.

To be clear, we decided to rename it to just *OWASP Summit 2017*, and give
it a focus on the collaboration between: OWASP Projects, Developers,
Application Security and DevOps.

*Working Sessions*

Summits are about its participants and Working sessions, they are a meeting
of minds passionate about Application Security.

There are no presentations, and all sessions are about *getting something
done*.

The Summit organisation team's objective is to set-up an hyper productive
and collaboration environment, it is up to the attendees (i.e. you) to
figure out what is the best use of your time and what to focus on.

As you can see at the Workshops page
<https://owasp.github.io/owasp-summit-2017/workshops.html>, there are
already a number of Working Sessions and Tracks being worked on (OwaspSAMM,
ZAP, WebGoat, Top 10, Mobile Security, AWS Security, Threat Modeling) but
we need a lot more.

This content is managed using GitHub
<https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/tree/master/Workshops>, please
help to improve the existing Working Session and create the pages with the
missing ones.

Here is how you should  think about the Summit: *"If you could get the best
minds of XYZ in the same room for a number of hours/days, what should they
work on?"*  (see more details below on the 'Why OWASP needs Summits'
section below)

If you can't make it to the venue of those dates, please also be involved
in the setup and content of these working sessions, since there will be
multiple ways to participate remotely and collaborate.

*Tickets*

There are two types of tickets for this Summit both covering participation
in the summit for the full 5 days.

- *5 days x 24h participant* (venue, lunch, dinner, accommodation): ?1,200
GBP (about $1,500 USD)
- *5 days x 8h participant *(venue, lunch) - ?400 GBP (about $500 USD)

As with the previous Summits the accommodation is based on villas (called
lodges at Woburn); these are a key part of making the event an 'OWASP
Summit'.

The layout of the CenterParcs Woburn villas/lodges is actually better than
the previous summits, and we are expecting a lot of high productive and
energetic sessions to occur :)

The tickets will soon be available for purchase, and if your OWASP Chapter
or Project has funds that it would like to use, please do that as soon as
possible.

Ideally your company will be able to support your participation in this
event. If that is not possible (or if you are an independent contractor)
then please let the Summit Team know about it, since there will be some
funds available to help out (especially if you are OWASP Leader with a
successful track record on an OWASP Project, Chapter or Conference)

There will also be a number of sponsorship opportunities available for
Companies and OWASP Chapters/Projects (at the moment we have: DevSecCon,
the OwaspSAMM project and the OWASP London chapter).

If you are planning to participate at the Summit, please add your name to
the Participants list
<https://owasp.github.io/owasp-summit-2017/participants.html> (even if at
the moment you don't know how your travel/accommodation/ticket costs will
be covered).

*Why OWASP needs Summits*

We need OWASP Summits because we need as a community and industry, a place
where we can come together and work on ideas and solutions.

We need places where we can have independent, non-vendor focused
discussions on the hard problems that we have.

OWASP is one of the few organisations in the world that is able to create
such environments for Application Security.

The problem we have with conferences is that they are very uni-directional.
They are people presenting their research, which is great, but there is
little collaboration with the participants. There is also a general concern
in our community about the lack of innovation in the hundreds of Security
conferences that exist every year worldwide. Usually, the best exchange of
ideas and collaboration happens at the conference's lobby. Some
participants even go these events not for the talks, but for the people
they will meet there. The problem is that those conversations are very ad
hoc, they aren't planned, there is no work done before, there is no
preparation for those conversations.

The summit allows you to be prepared for those exchanges. You know that you
are going to meet a critical mass of people that are interested, passionate
and knowledgeable about a specific topic, technology or tool (relevant to
you and your industry).

More importantly all participants are there to work. Everybody is focused
on creating important deliverables and solutions for Application Security
(like we did on previous Summits
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Outcomes#Appendix:_Working_Session_Details_and_Documentation>
).

What are those deliverables? It depends on the participants, it depends on
the people, it depends on who is going to go there, and how much effort
they put into it.

*All that we can do is to set the stage, it is up to the participants to
actually create magic and to create something quite amazing.*

*Please help, by booking your place asap*

Registrations will open soon. It will really help with the logistics and
management of the Summit if we have a good idea of the participants, what
type of ticket they need (with accommodation or not) and if they are able
to get their current company to cover the participation cost.

Let us know how we can help, and thanks for the help!

Dinis, Seba, Francois

Message-ID: <CAMPYwGXvk_zP+CUTbFXbh7t5xogcCXoP_bwk9W5YXQnkY_EeaA@mail.gmail.com>

All,
I'm nearing completion of the changes based on feedback in the spreadsheet.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TblUSU-VbTGUgcLBIYeVHkba0HZF7EEgCQaRQnhHr1I/edit#gid=0

Thank you for all the good feedback, it's taken a lot of time to work
through, but will result in a better end result for everyone.

Where are we on some of the other action items for v1.5?

- Transition Guide
- Presentation
- Wiki
- Something else I can't remember, just like I can't remember where the
meeting notes are...

I noticed that the Wiki still has v1.0 references in the online model that
we need to address along with v1.5 changes. I requested an account on the
OWASP Wiki, but never heard back so I am following up with that.

Thanks,
Brian

Hi,

Where is this 'Woburn Forest' location? Is this in or nearby London UK?

I checked: https://owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Events/upcoming_events

and it states London.

Thanks in advanced,

Best Regards, Met vriendelijke groet,

Mike,
I think it is located here:

Bedfordshire, 50 min away from London by rail (according to the
description).

Hi Brian,

I believe you?ve answered my question. I?m not sure why, but I thought the phase projections were automatically updating based on the interview value in Column E. Now I see that the cell color is dynamic based on interview answer and phase answer, but the actual value is not.

As you mentioned, I will manually adjust them to build out the roadmap.

Thanks for clarifying!

kevin

Hi Brian,

great work! Feel free to ping me when you feel it's reasonable to look 
over sth.

As for the Transition Guide - I provided Bruce with some skeleton 
proposal a few weeks ago and from what I understood he wanted to have a 
deeper look at it in the course of this week.

Cheers,
Daniel

would be good to make reference to the OWASP Maturity Models project
https://github.com/owasp/Maturity-Models which you can see in action at
http://138.68.145.52/view/project/samm

I'm doing a presentation at OWASP London next week on SAMM and this project
(will share the slides created) which should help to understand better how
it works and what it does. Some of the views it creates are quite
interesting

Hi Tal,

this looks a good help.  I do have a couple of points;

1) The questions are predominantely targetted at an organisation for a single product/application/service.  However, it's more difficult to apply to an organisation which creates products/applications/services across for many different clients, with different security needs.

2) Definitions of Low/Moderate/High are very helpful.  It gives something to base a judgement on.

3) In the context of SAMM, how should one interpret the results in their subsequent planning / implementation of SAMM?

Thanks,

Hi all,

one of the first steps in taking my organisation on it's SAMM journey is the activity "Estimate the Business Risk Profile" (Strategy and Metrics Level 1, Activity A).

I've been considering how I should do this and I want to obtain or develop a set of interview questions focused around the types of solutions and services my organisation builds, the perceived security risks, and impact to the business of those risks.

However I wondered how others have approached this - in particular if there are any resources I could adopt or customize for this activity?
