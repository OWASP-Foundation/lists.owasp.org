It is down for me also. I have contacted key OWASP people about it.
But there is little else that I can do. :(

Did you require the current SAMM documents or anything I maybe able to 
help you with?

Hi,
I also wanted to take a look at it, but it's down and also seems to be unreviewed since 4 years ago<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model_Project_-_Assessment_Frame>.
It would be really good if project health would be made more obvious on the owasp website.

Dear Christian and Erwin,

I could have sworn I had a local copy on my hard drive but I can not 
locate it. So, I have asked others who also work closely with the 
project, to see if they have local copies. I do hope I can help you both 
in the very near future.

As for the project health, It is actually active and I know that 
recently there has been work done. But I have forwarded the project 
health ideas to OWASP project management; it is something we should be 
doing better at.


Thank you,

Dennis

Hi,

I have uploaded the SAMM pdf file to the wiki and changed the download link
on the SAMM project page to:
https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c0/SAMM-1.0.pdf

We will look at providing a stable home for the OWASP documentation and
source files together with Pravir.


regards

Seba

Sorry about that everyone, I was away for a few days and didn't have access to my SSH keys to get into the server to fix it. We're working to get it shifted over into the OWASP hosted infrastructure just to make sure we don't get into this kind of situation again.
