<PRE>I saw the previous thread between Dave Rook and Colin Watson on mapping SAMM
to other maturity models. I'm definitely interested in getting this added to
SAMM since I feel it'll add huge benefits in terms of easing adoption. I saw
several names thrown out there like ISM3, COBIT, NIST SP800-53 Rev3, ISO
27001, and even ASVS. From other emails I've received from individuals,
people have also requested mappings to things like PCI and several other US
Gov't standards. Someone has also suggested mappings to BSIMM.
What do we think here? My thought was that mapping SAMM to *anything* makes
it more useful to people that are already using that particular something.
In other words, if you want to build the mapping, we'll take it!

I envision these mappings being self-contained &quot;companion&quot; docs. Like &quot;SAMM
1.0 - ISM3 Companion&quot;. I'll leave it to the first person that writes a SEP
and volunteers to build one to put together a straw-man for structure of a
companion doc. I'll, of course, volunteer to help that happen, but I don't
have the cycles to be the primary driver. Also, I'll take care of making the
look/feel consistent and doing the graphical layout.

Dave, Colin, everyone: What would you like to sign up for? Based on
volunteers, we might be able to get multiple people helping for each one.

Thanks!
