James,

I'm not familiar (yet) with the details of SP800-37.

However, to add another NIST SP document to this discussion, SP 800-64 (R2 of October 2008) is definitely also worth looking at in the secure development lifecycle context. Imho, from a bird's eye view, the main differences between SP 800-64 and SAMM/BSIMM are:

-          The NIST model is a process model, while SAMM and BSIMM are maturity models. This is a fundamentally different. In that sense, it is more related to the SDL/CLASP/TouchPoint type of models.

-          In the same line of reasoning, the NIST model is waterfall-based, while SAMM and BSIMM are actually process agnostic (they can be applied to waterfall, agile and other types of processes)

-          NIST SP 800-64 focuses much more on deployment, operations and disposal than any of the other models that I've seen so far.

I'd be also interested in hearing any other opinions about this one.


Best regards,
Bart.

I like your take. Maybe the SAMM team could provide formal commentary to
NIST in this regard. I suspect that in not providing feedback, it will
be published and those who read it at a later date will get confused as
to the value proposition of each aka more disturbances in the force...

hi kevin (and sc-l),

Sorry for the delay responding to this.  I was skiing yesterday with my

morning (leaving behind 6 inches of new snow in VA).  Anyway, better
late than never.

I'll interleave responses below.

Absolutely.  I think as an SSG lead in a particular company environment
you must have a prescriptive approach but that the approach you develop
will be better if informed by data from a descriptive model like BSIMM.
(For the record, I see SAMM as a prescriptive model that tells you often
in great detail what your initiative should be doing without knowing one
whit about how your organization ticks.)   If you read the article
carefully, there are two paragraphs that together should make this
clear.

Here's the first:
"Prescriptive models purport to tell you what you should do.
Promulgators of such models say things more like, "the model is chocked
full of value judgements [sic] about what organizations SHOULD be
doing."   That's just dandy, as long as any prescriptive model only
became prescriptive over time based on sufficient observation and
testing."

And here's the second:
"Also worthy of mention in this section is the "one size fits all"
problem that many prescriptive models suffer from.  The fact is, nobody
knows your organizational culture like you do. A descriptive comparison
allows you to gather descriptive data and adapt good ideas from others
while taking your culture into account."

BSIMM is meant to be a tool for the people running and SSG (and for that
matter, strategizing about a company's software security initiative).
The article is really about the differences between BSIMM and SAMM than
anything else.  It's not really about the difference between BSIMM and
ESAPI.  BSIMM and things like ESAPI fit together.

>Both are useful and ideally should go together like hand and glove.

Exactly right.

>I suspect that this apparent dichotomy in our perception of the 
>usefulness of the prescriptive vs. descriptive approaches is explained 
>in part by the different audiences with whom we associate.

Agreed.  See above.   BSIMM is a tool for executives to help build,
measure, and maintain a software security initiative.

>If our SSG were to hand them something like BSIMM, they would come away

>telling their management that we didn't help them at all.

Please do NOT even think about handing the BSIMM to developers as a
solution!  The BSIMM is a yardstick for an initiative, and it's meant
for a guy like you.  The notion is to measure your own initiative and
most importantly of all compare your initiative to your peers.

>This brings me to my fourth, and likely most controversial point. 
>Despite the interesting historical story about Feynman, I question

I think this is a valid criticism.  The only thing that makes BSIMM more
scientific than other methodologies like the Touchoints, SDL, CLASP, or
SAMM, is that the BSIMM uses real data and real measurement.  However
the measurement technique is certainly not foolproof.  (Incidentally, I
state that view pretty clearly in the article...computer science, and
other fields with "science" in their name are usually not.)

>While I am certainly not privy to the exact method used to arrive at

This criticism holds some water, but you are shooting from the hip and
it is pretty clear that you have not read the BSIMM itself.   That, and
the first article we wrote about the BSIMM explain our methods pretty
clearly. Please read those two things and lets continue this line of
questioning.

This is pretty clearly explained in the BSIMM itself.

Given the reaction to actual results from the 30 companies who have
participated so far in the study, I'll respectfully call you out as
incorrect on that one.  Turns out that most people who run large SSGs
and initiatives are hungry for comparison with peers (and indeed want to
meet and learn from the peers).  Experience in the field is bearing out
the utility of the BSIMM, and the fact that the data we are gathering is
supporting the model in important ways is no small potatoes either.

>After observing this field for 30+ years (ouch!), I have concluded that

Some of us do.  Others don't.  But I think a sea change is underway even
in our little subfield of software security

I concur.

Thanks for your carefully considered posting Kevin.  Hope this response
is satisfying.

Message-ID: <BFD50E79FBE23A4FB6BE93572A6FE28702D18B2E@AD1HFDEXC312.ad1.prod>

Is it possible for us to create an accompanying primer such that we
provide clarity on the following?

SAMM is not about code review, Top X lists, etc

SAMM is a strategic tool. It provides no guidance on what to address
first, but tactically speaking, we should provide some guidance to help
folks figure it out?

ISACA and the auditor crowd would like to explore notions of
"compensating controls" so can we add a section that includes secondary
suggestions?

Some guidance on how to deploy SAMM depending on what type of
organization you are? For example, us Financial Services heavily
regulated types have a different take than say a regional grocery store
chain.

Metrics, to some we feel to qual, and won't satisfy the quant types.
Maybe a survey or two is in order?

Also, when looking at SP 800-64, be sure to look at Figure 3-2 where one of the Outputs is Development and Coding Standards and section 3.1.3.5 Secure Code Practices and Repositories.
Is it as extensive as BSIMM or SAMM?  Surely not, but this is a major step forward toward getting Software Security included in a recognized standard.
Per 800-37, a note from section 3.3, "Organizations use best practices when implementing the security controls within the information system including system and software engineering methodologies, security engineering principles, and secure coding techniques."  The Risk Management Framework included here, as well as 800-53 and -39 is the way the government is moving and it is good to see that software security is being included, yet still needs to be highlighted and emphasized by professionals such as those in this group.

I like your take. Maybe the SAMM team could provide formal commentary to
NIST in this regard. I suspect that in not providing feedback, it will
be published and those who read it at a later date will get confused as
to the value proposition of each aka more disturbances in the force...

James,



I'm not familiar (yet) with the details of SP800-37.



However, to add another NIST SP document to this discussion, SP 800-64
(R2 of October 2008) is definitely also worth looking at in the secure
development lifecycle context. Imho, from a bird's eye view, the main
differences between SP 800-64 and SAMM/BSIMM are:

-          The NIST model is a process model, while SAMM and BSIMM are
maturity models. This is a fundamentally different. In that sense, it is
more related to the SDL/CLASP/TouchPoint type of models.

-          In the same line of reasoning, the NIST model is
waterfall-based, while SAMM and BSIMM are actually process agnostic
(they can be applied to waterfall, agile and other types of processes)

-          NIST SP 800-64 focuses much more on deployment, operations
and disposal than any of the other models that I've seen so far.



I'd be also interested in hearing any other opinions about this one.



Best regards,

Bart.

hi kevin (and sc-l),

Sorry for the delay responding to this.  I was skiing yesterday with my

I'll interleave responses below.

Absolutely.  I think as an SSG lead in a particular company environment
you must have a prescriptive approach but that the approach you develop
will be better if informed by data from a descriptive model like BSIMM.
(For the record, I see SAMM as a prescriptive model that tells you often
in great detail what your initiative should be doing without knowing one
whit about how your organization ticks.)   If you read the article
carefully, there are two paragraphs that together should make this
clear.

Here's the first:
"Prescriptive models purport to tell you what you should do.
Promulgators of such models say things more like, "the model is chocked
full of value judgements [sic] about what organizations SHOULD be
doing."   That's just dandy, as long as any prescriptive model only
became prescriptive over time based on sufficient observation and
testing."

And here's the second:
"Also worthy of mention in this section is the "one size fits all"
problem that many prescriptive models suffer from.  The fact is, nobody
knows your organizational culture like you do. A descriptive comparison
allows you to gather descriptive data and adapt good ideas from others
while taking your culture into account."

BSIMM is meant to be a tool for the people running and SSG (and for that
matter, strategizing about a company's software security initiative).
The article is really about the differences between BSIMM and SAMM than
anything else.  It's not really about the difference between BSIMM and
ESAPI.  BSIMM and things like ESAPI fit together.

>Both are useful and ideally should go together like hand and glove.

Exactly right.

>I suspect that this apparent dichotomy in our perception of the 
>usefulness of the prescriptive vs. descriptive approaches is explained 
>in part by the different audiences with whom we associate.

Agreed.  See above.   BSIMM is a tool for executives to help build,
measure, and maintain a software security initiative.

>If our SSG were to hand them something like BSIMM, they would come away

>telling their management that we didn't help them at all.

Please do NOT even think about handing the BSIMM to developers as a
solution!  The BSIMM is a yardstick for an initiative, and it's meant
for a guy like you.  The notion is to measure your own initiative and
most importantly of all compare your initiative to your peers.

Bart,

The only exception I'd take to your comment on SP 800-64 is that while the linear/waterfall method is used to describe the phase concepts, it is not intended for just waterfall.  Please see the last paragraph of the introduction to Chapter Two where it notes the concepts can be applied to any SDLC model and note Appendix E.  Also, the wheel diagram of phases at the beginning of Chapter Three has an inner arrow that shows the continuous cycle, though disposal wouldn't really be part of the continuous cycle, yet needs to recognized as a legitimate phase at some point.

SP 800-64 fits well with 800-53 and -37 and -60.

NIST has created a draft document entitled: Guide for applying risk
management framework to federal information systems: a security
lifecycle approach. Curious to know if anyone has identified gaps,
differences in opinion, etc between NIST and how either SAMM or BSIMM
would define the same?

James,

I'm not familiar (yet) with the details of SP800-37.

However, to add another NIST SP document to this discussion, SP 800-64 (R2 of October 2008) is definitely also worth looking at in the secure development lifecycle context. Imho, from a bird's eye view, the main differences between SP 800-64 and SAMM/BSIMM are:

-          The NIST model is a process model, while SAMM and BSIMM are maturity models. This is a fundamentally different. In that sense, it is more related to the SDL/CLASP/TouchPoint type of models.

-          In the same line of reasoning, the NIST model is waterfall-based, while SAMM and BSIMM are actually process agnostic (they can be applied to waterfall, agile and other types of processes)

-          NIST SP 800-64 focuses much more on deployment, operations and disposal than any of the other models that I've seen so far.

I'd be also interested in hearing any other opinions about this one.


Best regards,
Bart.

I am toying with the notion of writing an article for the insurance
vertical entitled: The Ten Things You Need to Know about Application
Security where the audience is not IT-savvy users, but one of insurance
agents who handle a variety of security concerns ranging from
personally-identitifable information to credit cards as part of the
business process.

If you ever watched game shows such as Jeopardy, you would be familiar
with the fact that the answer is known and the user has to provide the
question. So, what do folks here think that a business user should be
asking when it comes to measuring security maturity?

That's a good question, really. First thought is to immediately jump
to a conversation about risks and unknowns vs. knowns, etc. BUT, I
think based on experience, most are generally WAY more basic than that
when it comes to appsec (at least when they're getting a program off
the ground all the way up until we'd anecdotally say a company "has an
appsec program"). In those stages the questions are more like (roughly
in order, tho some oscillation):
 * Is this really a (potential) problem? Usually an easily evinced point.
 * Am I doing anything about it right now?
 * Is what I'm doing good enough or should I be trying to change things?
 * How do we measure any of this madness since I need to manage it?

Dunno if that helps, just my $0.02 while in between flights. Glad to
help further if you want to collaborate on the article.

Traditionally, articles have approached this subject more from the
perspective of the reader wanting to do something about security within
their own context. For an industry rag, I think the question changes
slightly to how can I measure the security of others. Consider the
scenario of an independent insurance agent who has a fidicuary duty to
protect their customer's data. If they wanted to get a competitive quote
for insurance on behalf of their customer (say Pravir) what should they
ask The Hartford, Traveler's, Geico, AIG, etc about their application
security in terms of maturity?
