Dear all,

It has been (too) quiet on this list.
Nothing better than a deadline to push things forward!

I propose to organize a SAMM Summit on Friday 27 and Saturday 28 2015 of
March in Dublin.
Friday would be a SAMM User day with training and sharing SAMM use cases
Saturday would be a workgroup(s) day on pushing SAMM content forward

why Dublin:
1) they have good (and cheap) flight connections in Europe and from the US.
2) Guinness really tastes better when served in Ireland :-)

call to action:
Quick poll (reply to me or to the list), will you come to the SAMM Summit
in Dublin on 27-28 March 2015
Yes (Friday)
Yes (Saturday)
Yes (both days)
No
Maybe
Can you put it on another date?
Can you put it on another location?

I will compile the responses / feedback by next week (18-Oct)

kind regards,

Seba

Dublin is a good location idea. But I'd prefer a different weekend,
since that;s my 50 birthday weekend. Any other weekend in 2015!

Is there any information on how SAMM is trending... what is the traction
level on this at this point? Has there been any
feedback/suggestion/request for improvements etc.? 

I hear about in informal discussions, but is there a way to enable
information sharing... at least on high level (a survey?).

Please note that I am aware of current 7 participants, but I believe the
number is much higher...and enabling information sharing can help push
the initiative...

Dear all,

The results of the Poll are:

Yes (Friday) maybe (1)
Yes (Saturday) 1
Yes (both days) 12
No
Maybe 3
Can you put it on another date? 1
Can you put it on another location? 1 (NYC)


Meaning: we have a GO to organise our first SAMM Summit on 27-28 Mar 2015
in Dublin

Colin: we will make sure to have birthday cake! I hope you can make it.

I will start arrangements / logistics with Eoin and put up details on the
wiki in the next weeks.

For now: make sure to have your agendas blocked.

Looking forward to see/work with you in Dublin!

kind regards,

Seba

Cool, let me know budget. Can we get some from mothership for this worthy cause?? 
I shall look for accommodation and venue for the 27th & 28th once I have confirmed numbers - 12 or shall there be more?

Based on the Donation Scoreboard
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&key=0Atu4kyR3ljftdEdQWTczbUxoMUFnWmlTODZ2ZFZvaXc&hl=en_US&gid=3>,
it looks like the OpenSAMM project has over $5600 in funds available and
this seems like a great use of those funds to advance the project.  If you
think you'll need more than that, I'd like to see a more detailed budget
and plan of action before we commit the Foundation to fund part of this.
That said, I'm a big fan of OpenSAMM and look forward to seeing what the
group is going to accomplish with this.

I can probably make it on both the days in Dublin. Can you please put my
name on this list? It will be a great opportunity for me to meet the board
members as well.

Thanks
