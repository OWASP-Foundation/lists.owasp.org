Dear all,

We had great participation for the SAMM workshop we had in Hamburg. It was
a very useful and productive session. A lot of action points were defined.

For your information: meeting notes & actions points we discussed:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/12mB7FkmhcI04YDZle_VD90n1xcENgNhAGqZkCAb6EkM/edit

As you can see there are a number of action items where we can definitely
need your help with!
If you can spare some cycles, do not hesitate to contact me: I will make
sure to get you up and running!

We will have a similar workshop in New York
Time: Thursday November 21, 2013 1:00pm - 5:00pm
Location: Foundstone offices (near the conference venue)
If you plan to participate, add your name to the agenda:

We might also organise a SAMM workshop in Lima (Peru) for AppSec LATAM: is
there anybody interested to participate?

Thanks

Kind regards

Seba

Hey guys,
I was wondering if you might have already an executive type of presentation with SAMM assessment findings against the a company.
So I did run the assessment against current infrastructure, now I want to make a pres that shows the business case with weaknesses, samm proposed roadmap?  I want to show this to the exec and get resources and start a project on improving SDLC based on this.
If somebody did something similar I would be happy to reuse.
Thanks

Hi Cristian,

I am not aware of an executive presentation of SAMM, but you are free to
(re)use the slide deck I used at the Geneva chapter meeting last June:
