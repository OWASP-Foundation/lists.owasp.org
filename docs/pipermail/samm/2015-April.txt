Message-ID: <CAAihoGvrWF_-C4mXqg54rRi=NtyBxcUBm98vyCX91EESur6LJw@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

Last week we had our first OpenSAMM Summit in Dublin on 27-28 March.

Full agenda for the User and Project Day are available here:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Summit_2015

We had about 30 people gathering on the User day, with presentations (now
available online (linked in the agenda page), a short OpenSAMM training
(slides also available) and 2 great round tables to discuss OpenSAMM
experiences.

On Friday evening most attendees came together in the centre of Dublin for
the social event in the Cocktail / Winter Garden at Fade Street Social.
Great food and lots of Guinness!

The Project day on Saturday was packed with constructive discussions and
decisions on the content and release of v1.1 of OpenSAMM and the evolution
of the tooling & guidance to support is. More details on the OpenSAMM
Benchmark initiative - which was announce during the User day ? were
presented and debated together with a timeline for the release of the first
data set (expect this by September 2015).

The User day meeting notes ? together with the list of actions ? are
available here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pC4har75olF1WPZaqRfXFG9T3SS_qoEUvHkEynE0iTI
<%22>

The final release of OpenSAMM v1.1 will be done in the coming weeks. The
core model will be split of the full document. Some nomenclature changes
were decided to better cover the underlying OpenSAMM security activities.
The how-to, templates, toolbox and quick-start guide will be released
separately and will have their own versioning. The existing mappings from
other frameworks will also be updated and now includes a mapping on PCI DSS
v3.

Overall feedback scores from the survey on the summit were great. Overall
score was 93.3 % ! Detailed scores and lessons learned have been captured
here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tHdZFjsNwqhD1iYXBQyrgtBLLI_sTRn_kx8HSyKqNEY
<%22>

I want to thank all participants, my project co-leaders and the supporting
sponsors for making this summit a big success!

I will finish with the following quote: *"The SAMM summit provided an
opportunity to breathe new life into a framework that I use to facilitate
my day-to-day work and support my customers."* Bruce C Jenkins, Fortify
Security Lead, Hewlett-Packard Company

Stay tuned for the release of OpenSAMM v1.1 and hope to see you at one of
our next OpenSAMM summits!

Kind regards,

Seba

OpenSAMM project team

Message-ID: <CAGvXZhtV7qVu8O4_YfikiVsObfyrQ45ZvjMyYoVLdbOvw-veYg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

as discussed during the Summit, I've been working on the quickstart guide.
I've started from a version created by David Fern, processed as much as
possible all feedback that I've seen, and introduced some other elements
that I think should be in there.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwCkNOH6vzXtMnRIazlRT1NVZ3M/view?usp=sharing

I'd be interested in hearing your feedback. What do you think should be
part of the quickstart guide ? On the one hand, it must be concise (after
all, it is a quick start guide), on the other hand, it should be
sufficiently self-contained. All ideas are welcome !

Best,
Bart.

Hi Seba,

Sorry, I missed the call today but the invitation said 20h30 UTC which was just 10 min ago ? and I joined the call at that time. Bruce told me that the call started one hour ago. It would be nice if you could clarify that. Is there a way to catch up on what was discussed today?

Thanks,
Carsten

I must have made a mistake converting CET to UTC (probably due to daylight
saving change)
Terribly sorry
The minutes (still in draft) are available on
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R2feB6u1tqMBx516GpTwfFssnnduOxeBwEsUrPoCvwI/edit
most important are the action points of the summit that were followed up
here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pC4har75olF1WPZaqRfXFG9T3SS_qoEUvHkEynE0iTI/edit
I will also schedule weekly calls as of next week - usual timing (will make
sure to communicate the correct time)
apologies for the confusion!

kind regards

Seba

Hi Stephen,

That's all still being pulled together from the contributors - we want
to make sure that the first drop has a good quantity of data right
from the start.

As most of the contributing folks are all at RSA next week I wouldn't
expect it then, but we'll announce to the list as soon as this is
available.

Best regards

Justin

I wonder if some of you would be able to share Software Assurance
Processes Templates, such as documents or flow diagrams...?
(Process flow diagrams for Verification, Security Testing and Code

That will be much appreciated.

Jerome,

there is no such thing as a standard process template within OpenSAMM. It
often depends on the level of granularity that you need, and what your (or
the target) company is already using in development.

If you have a clean sheet to start from, you might want to look into (from
higher level to more detailed): BPMN, Data flow diagrams, UML collaboration
diagrams, or similar. Google, Visio or other modeling tools will be able to
support you in finding a way to create them.

HTH,
Bart.

Thanks Bart for the quick reply, appreciated.
I wonder if there is one resource where I could find guidance/best
practices, if not templates, for, even high level, process diagrams
for Verification and Deployment.
I was looking in OWASP CLASP, for reuse, but nothing there.
Well I guess, I will go for dirty hands ;)

Thanks again
Cheers

I unfortunately cannot make the call, either, due to another obligation. Best case is that I dial in and lurk.
