Subject: [SAMM] Mapping SAMM to other maturity models
Message-ID: <49D1D178.4020706@realexpayments.com>

Hi everyone,

I'd like to say that I was very impressed by the work produced here 
guys, nice job Pravir (I'm pretty sure we talked at the OWASP EU Summit 
in November actually about your black Macbook!).

I posted a comment on the website about mapping the SAMM maturity levels 
to those of common frameworks such as COBIT. The IT part of my business 
uses COBIT whilst security uses ISM3 from an operational security 
standpoint and now SAMM for app sec. The useful thing about the ISM3 is 
the maturity levels are already mapped to COBIT making it easy for me to 
use it for security and still deliver a COBIT score to IT. I would like 
to do the same for SAMM, in fact I will have to do it internally anyway 
if I want to use it so I wondered if this is something that you feel 
would be useful to add to the SAMM project?

Dave

Hi David - that's a good idea.

Recently I had to read through the draft NIST SP800-53 Rev3 as part of
the Global Industry Committee's work, so we might be able to map SAMM
to some of the controls in there too.  I'd be happy to give it a try
if it would be useful?

Maybe we could do the same for ISO 27001?

Regards

Colin Watson

Hi Colin,

I think that by mapping it to the most popular standards we can decrease 
the workload associated with implementing SAMM. I think the ISO 27001 is 
another good one to map it to.

I'm happy enough to go ahead and start with mapping it to COBIT.

David

Yes, good point.  Shall we see what Pravir thinks, in case something
has been started already?

Mapping to ASVS is another...

Hi Colin,

That sounds good to me, I look forward to seeing what Pravir thinks on this.
