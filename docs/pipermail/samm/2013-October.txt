Dear all,

As a result of the Hamburg workshop a list of actions was created.
I have turned these in a list of work packages where you can contribute
according to your available cycles.

The list is online at:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AocY8G2SHaWKdHhKZXdnek1hcFFRTWhzN1NRQWd0d1E&usp=sharing#gid=0

You can also find this link on the wiki via:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model#tab=Project

The first sheet "Work Packages" contains the current list of activities.
The second sheet "Guidance" provides some guidelines on the Work Package
follow-up.

A separate list of potential SAMM changes, improvements and fixes is still
to be created (WP.7).
Once we decide on the implementation of proposed SAMM changes, these will
be transferred to the Work Package list.

As you will see, there are quite some Work Packages that need some love and
an owner, ranging from 4 hours to 5 days of estimated work.

If you want to take ownership of one of these items, do NOT hesitate to do
so and in parallel contact me if you need any help to get you started.
Completed work packages will result in you being recognised as a
contributor to the next SAMM version 1.1.

Do not hesitate to contact me - or any of the other co-project leaders -
with your questions and/or remarks!

Thank you,

Kind regards,

Seba

Hi Seba,

I am a QSA and a PCIP certified assessor, and could certainly help with the PCI mappings (WP24)  Also, we should consider mapping to both 2.0 and 3.0 versions of the PCI DSS.

Also, I can help with creating a CheatSheet, but to do that I would like a little more guidance on what goals the document is intended accomplish.

Please, let me know the best way to get started.

Best Regards,

Yan Kravchenko

P.S. I am also planning on attending the workshop in NY.

Another person has offered to help on the cheat sheet by direct email to me
and Pravir. I have asked if they are willing to share their details more
widely to this group.

I will be in NY too.

Message-ID: <CA+SZ5US4hD4CaHTDeM0bV8j_wThs9peNYqTTfy=hk8ydM8tj5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Just wanted to share with you a quick tool that I've put together to
provide a quick way for people to self-assess against OpenSAMM.

Keen to know your thoughts, and how best I can incorporate it back into the
OpenSAMM project.

Originally posted at
http://labs.asteriskinfosec.com.au/samm-self-assessment-tool/

==== Say 'Hi' to the SAMM Self Assessment Tool ====

Asterisk are happy to be releasing their first public beta of the SAMM Self
Assessment Tool, or SSA. One of our favourite OWASP projects is the
OpenSAMM project, and for those who haven't seen OpenSAMM before, it is a
framework to help organisations to evaluate their current software security
practices, and build measurable targets and plans for improving these
practices.

Part of OpenSAMM includes conducting assessments (you can't manage what you
can't measure right?). The OpenSAMM methodology categorises these
assessments as either Lightweight or Detailed. SSA aims to provide a very
simple way to perform this Lightweight assessment, and compare your current
status with some pre-canned target states. And literally, that's it.

We've used this tool on a number of engagements to quickly gauge where an
organisation is, and it's certainly helped with figuring out the 'current
state' of an organisations software security maturity.

There's currently two different ways you can use SSA:
 1. You can visit https://ssa.asteriskinfosec.com.au/ and complete the
checklist directly. You don't even have to save your assessment anywhere if
you don't want. On the other hand, if you want to store your results,
there's a few ways to do that, such as in your cookies or online in a
database. For online storage you need to Sign Up, either with a username
and password (please don't re-use your passwords folks), or you can sign in
with a Google account too.
 2. Clone a copy of the Rails app and spin it up somewhere locally. We
recognised quite early on that some organisations may feel uncomfortable
with tracking this sort of information on the Internet, so, if you have the
capability, sure, feel free to clone the repository locally and do what you
wish. https://github.com/AsteriskLabs/ssa

SSA is being released under an MIT license, and our intent is to give it
back to the OWASP community for further enhancements. We have a high level
list of proposed features available on the GitHub page, but currently
they're being developed on a 'When Christian Has Time and is Sober'
timescale.

====

Cheers all!

Hi Christian,

That is just *awesome*. I will definitely add this to our upcoming SAMM
tools/resources wiki section.

We would love to integrate this tool in the OpenSAMM project and host it on
the OWASP infrastructure.
Can you help us with that?

thank you!

Kind regards

Hey Seba,

Certainly very interested!

Keen to see this become either a project or sub-project of OpenSAMM.

And very keen to see further system and OWASP integration (i.e, provide
links, tips to OWASP materials, or provide easier ways to get deeper access
to SAMM material etc).

Regards,

Christian

Hi,

Regularly I get asked: "who actually uses OpenSAMM"?

>From my personal experience I know quite a lot of organisations that do,
but it would be great if we could point interested people to our list of
OpenSAMM adopters:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OpenSAMM_Adopters

Currently the page lists 6 organisations that testify their usage of SAMM.

I am sure there are more, much more!
The latest stats from the opensamm.org web site show more than 150 unique
visitors per day.
That is more than 50,000 unique visitors per year, not counting the OWASP
SAMM wiki page.

Therefor I ask YOUR help.

If your organisation uses SAMM, or you know of an organisation that uses
SAMM:
ask them to come forward and be listed on the OpenSAMM adopter page?

All we need is:
1) Organization Name
2) Contact
3) Role
4) Organization Type
5) Region
6) Testimonial (optional, but would be great)

If they agree, you can add them to the wiki page yourself.
If you do not have a wiki account, you can also forward the information to
me: I will post it for you.

If each of us adds one or more SAMM users, we will grow this list to
hundreds of public references!

Thank you,

Kind regards ,

Seba
