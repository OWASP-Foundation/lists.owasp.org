Subject: [SAMM] linking resources to SAMM Practices - how to ?
Message-ID: <CAAihoGtHXXmDqD6AfwYGQXd0QB1UBAd6_rY9no2jKwme9UGPrg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear,

I am setting up categories to link OWASP pages / resources to SAMM
Practices.

The setup is to create a category for each maturity level in each practice
and use this throughout the OWASP wiki to link the pages/resources directly.

First try out is here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SAMM-CR-1

I have also created a category hierarchy to link them all together:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SAMM-Resources

if you think this is useful - feel free to add categories (following the
same structure) and start adding OWASP resources?

any feedback  - ranging from "this might work" to "bad idea" or "how about
doing it like this: ..." - are welcome :-)

regards

Seba

Seba

Does this assume that SAMM will always have the same categories in v2, 3 etc?

Subject: [SAMM] Sprint to cover user story "What (OWASP) resources are
 available for SAMM practices"?
Message-ID: <CAAihoGtJ80f4ni_14eb6DVAfF=n_b1CTJUavjnsLJ+EtDXS0uQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

We have one week for the first SAMM Summit in Dublin:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Summit_2015

One user story to complete before the project day is:

"What (OWASP) resources are available for SAMM practices"
additional conditions:

   - I need to find these on the wiki
   - Ideally I can browse through the different resources that are available
   - From the resources I can go back to the related SAMM practice
   - these link OWASP and non OWASP resources


I have created the Wiki categories to link the OWASP resources to the
related SAMM practices here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SAMM-Resources

and started populating :

   - SAMM-CR-1? (2 C, 1 P, 1 F)
   - SAMM-CR-2? (4 P)
   - SAMM-EG-1? (3 C, 5 P, 1 F)
   - SAMM-SM-1? (1 C, 2 P)
   - SAMM-TA-1? (1 C, 3 P)

C - linked categories
P - linked pages
F - linked media

*My question to you is:*
Please take some time to link projects / pages / media to the SAMM
practices that are still Empty.

We will review them next Saturday during the Summit to include them in the
V1.1 release of SAMM.

thanks for your help!

PS: there are still some seats for the summit - registration is here

Message-ID: <CAAihoGtfrF4rwxjQWjvwx5xgOg8fjxZCEYD-=GARzTPAPQ_rNQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

We have published the draft agenda online:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Summit_2015#tab=Project_Day

Topics that will be covered during the day are:

   - Analysis templates / tooling
   - SAMM model improvements
   - What to put in next release / roadmap
   - Finalizing / publishing OpenSAMM v1.1
   - Project 71 follow-up (benchmark repository)
   - opensamm.org website - next steps

We will end each session with defined outputs including action plans,
responsible and timing.

For each of the sessions we will have one topic leader and one note taker
to capture the proceedings, decisions and next steps (with owners & timing)

If you have input for additional topics or ideas to be covered during the
summit: please let us know?

Looking forward to see you all in Dublin next week!

Sorry I could not make the SAMM event in dublin yesterday and today. I hope the venue I picked for both the event and social gathering was appropriate and worked out.
I'm afraid I could not control the weather. 
Have fun.

Hey Eoin,
this was a shame!

We had a lot of fun and great discussions on next SAMM releases!

Thank you Seba, Bart and all,
Mat
