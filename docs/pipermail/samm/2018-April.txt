Subject: [SAMM] For public feedback - OWASP SAMMv2 alpha release
Message-ID: <CAAihoGvBH9Vpcr2THtc1Z084FezCxxgEJsWLGzTFpnXf7S0HSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


After a year of work by the SAMMv2 team, we now release the alpha version
of our new SAMMv2 framework.

Our objective is to update the SAMM framework taking into account the
following improvements:

1) clean out inconsistencies from the previous release;

2) a more logical flow of maturity levels of the security activities as
part of the SAMM practices;

3) take into account agile software development and DevOps practices;

4) decrease the number of "audit or quality gate" activities in the
previous framework.

A core team - with the help of many volunteers - has worked on the new
framework since the last OWASP summit in June 2017.

During that summit, we lay the foundations of version 2.0.

We then added more details to the draft version with a SAMM summit in
Reykjavik and extra online conference calls throughout 2017 and the last
months.

The major changes are:

1) The addition of a new business function "Implementation", covering 3
security practices: Secure Build, Secure Deployment and Defect Management.

2) The introduction of 2 "Activity Streams" per security practice (this
replaces the A and B activities which did not have a logical relation in
the previous release). Each activity stream consists of 3 security
activities (increasing in maturity level).

The current draft framework is created in a spreadsheet as this provides a
better overview.

The final framework will be released in yaml format, with an updated
toolbox and document.

We now release the draft version for feedback, available here:

OneDrive: https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ag3u_YTLhehYgaNki2Voe0t-6UaGbw

GitHub:
https://github.com/OWASP/samm/blob/master/v2.0/alpha/SAMM-Model-v2.00%20alpha%20release.xlsx

We invite you to read the new framework and welcome all your feedback
(questions, remarks, update suggestions or typos)!

You can share your feedback:

   -

   in our SAMM mailing list: https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/samm
   -

   in our SAMM Slack channel: https://owasp.slack.com/messages/C0VF1EJGH
   -

   (preferred) through a feedback form:
   https://goo.gl/forms/c5fYJIgzxV7DRmdE2
   -

   during our next SAMM project call on 11-April-2018


We will take into account all the feedback received by 19-April-2018.


Thank you!


Kind regards,


the SAMM team

Dear All,

Great work!! Of course as 'fan' of the current version of SAMM I like to 
contribute to make this v2 also usable.

The GoogleForm for sending input does not work for me.

So I downloaded the xls from the github repository and added some remarks.

The xls with my remarks is added as issue on the samm github issue list 
uploaded (https://github.com/OWASP/samm/issues).

Remarks made in xls, see below:

Cel: C4
Imho this should be limited to either measure value of:
- data
- IS-systems(applications /software) or
- determine business IT risks
It is now not clear and far too wide.
Cel: D5
Develop a business case (instead of build ?)
Building a business case is a proces on its own.
Cel: C6
Not Clear how 'undersanding' can be made objective. A SAMM assessment 
should not deliver discussions, imho it should be a measurements of 
risks for this point towards clear objective criteria.
Cel: D6
Suggestion: Develop a security strategy plan (instead of 'strategic plan')
Cel: C7
Most of the time a default approved business risk profile is not 
present. It is also in many companies common practice to make a clear 
seperation between IT risks and business risks. IT risks are part of 
business risk, but business risks are far more wider. So
maybe rephrase this to: Align or update the IT risks to the business 
risks profile if present.
(seeing G1, SAMM is for IT risks) to
Cel: C8
For G1 most of the time a decent classification schema for IT risks is 
not present. So if the aim of SAMMv2 is to create more consultancy work, 
excelllent job, else consider this improvement:
Classify determined IT risks using the business classification schema if 
present. If a standard classification schema is not present consider 
creating one based on an open industry standard classification schema 
for the business under consideration.
Cel: E10
Suggestion: Keep it tailored to security complliance. Business 
compliance is an other world. Even so with privacy compliance.
Cel: C12
Most compliance rules have nothing to do with IT security. So why a 
'single' panel-of-glass??
Q:'What is meant with the term 'patchwork' in this context?
Suggestion: Concentrate IT standards and policies is often already hard 
enough.
Cel: C13
Suggestion:Tailor it down to security relevant compliance drivers.
Cel: D17
Suggestion: Not only to application devs, but to all who are in the 
devops or developement proces active. IT and not IT people.
Cel: E17
Centralize should not be the goal. Imho with large enterprises it is 
better to steer on security knowlegde available within all business 
units and coordinate this. Central coordination is different than having 
all knowlegde centralized.
Cel: C18
Suggestion: Security education.
So ommit the word 'technical'
Cel: C19
'build-security-in ..' : No clue what is meant here.
Suggestion: Develop a security by design mindset
Cel: D30
Using use-cases within a agile devops teams can work just well. 
Collecting and tracing requirements is a bit 'old-skool'. Key is to have 
security use-cases when developing a product.
Cel: C33
This will be opionion based. So suggestion: Ask for certifications or 
training or security audit reports.
Cel: D38
Standardization can be a huge thread for security. Why standardize?
Suggestion: Evaluate and determine if and where standardization on IT 
building blocks (software, framworks, OS etc) lowers security risks.
Cel: E38
Biased opinion. What is 'standard?'
Suggestion: Use technologies that meet security standards and 
certifications. E.g. for OSS there is the badge-program present 
(bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org)(
Cel: C49
So devops is not possible? Maybe change this to:
Make use of different roles, account and implement multiple-eye 
principles where needed for (manual) deployment.
Cel: B51
Opmerking: (Bart) should we say something about configuration file 
integrity ?

 > Imho: Not too much, this can be done on multiple ways, but if you 
prefer to add something: Use an approved and method that is recommend by 
standard bodies (e.g. NIST)

(Yan) by requiring treating configuration files as code and using 
versioning, we are starting to focus on integrit. It's also addressed in 
the Deployment process. I played with the langugae, and it always comes 
of a little redundant.
