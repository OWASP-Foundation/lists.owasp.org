Subject: [SAMM] Minneapolis SAMM summit outcomes
Message-ID: <CAAihoGv4uZmBL0yVdwhbmmqQqiX2S65fPdQSfuFzCE2LvUJqLA@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

It has been a couple of weeks ago, and we have caught up again with our
work after the SAMM Summit we did on 13-14 October.

8 project volunteers flew into Minneapolis and worked hard in a 2-day
sprint on the next version of SAMM. Here are some of our main outcomes:

   1. We reviewed and updated the SAMMv2 Beta activities for all the 5
   business functions. The latest version is available here:
   http://owaspsamm.org/
   2. We started mapping SAMMv1.5 activities to SAMMv2.0 activities.
   3. We discussed possible improvements in the maturity assessment
   methodology with focus on the outcomes and benefits of the activities,
   rather than performing the activities.
   4. We created the data model to cover all the data elements,
   relationships and characteristics necessary to describe the core data model.
   5. We started an outline of the SAMMv2 marketing and promotion plan.

You can read through the details and see more of the outcomes here:
https://github.com/OWASP/samm/blob/master/v2.0/summit-201810-Minneapolis/Summit-outcomes.md

Special thanks to Yan Kravchenko who welcomed us with a home baked
super-pie and gallons of coffee!

If you have any questions or suggestions on SAMM, please let us know!
Happy to discuss further on our OWASP SAMM Slack channel here:
https://owasp.slack.com/messages/C0VF1EJGH
(If you are not on the OWASP Slack workspace, let me know I will send you
the invite link).

Kind regards

Seba

PS - we will start a sponsor push in the coming months, let me know if you
want to support our project?

Message-ID: <CAAihoGsH-EoAMLAg2eGxD54tDY9BfiSYNQdtphJJjvs_3=qbUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In the coming months we plan to release the beta and release candidate
versions of OWASP SAMMv2.

As team we have contributed and edited parts of the text, of which the
latest version is available here: http://owaspsamm.org/

We are looking to hire a technical editor to help us with these releases.
Main tasks would be to get a consistent vocabulary, tone and structure
throughout the text.

We are looking for a native English speaking candidate who has a keen eye
for detail, ideally a graduate or postgraduate. (S)he has exceptional
accuracy, attention to detail, excellent research, proofreading and IT
skills (Word, MarkDown and GitHub) as well as written and verbal
communication skills.

Let me know if your organisation has a resource available, or if can you
recommend someone to help us?

Thank you,

Seba

Everyone is of course free to volunteer and review our materials when we
