Subject: [SAMM] OWASP SAMM - project reboot and change of leadership
Message-ID: <CAAihoGsB_ts-xWzjgTjKVbphZrrvzgPLGAdhtAbaaVf=JdKfhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

During the last month I have exchanged emails/calls with Pravir, Samantha
and lots of other people who have supported SAMM in the past.

SAMM (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model)
is an important OWASP project and needs an active project team to push it
to the next level and maintain it in the future.


I will take over the OWASP SAMM project leadership for 2013 with as main
objectives:

1) build a list of (reference) organisations that use SAMM

2) create a SAMM user group to exchange experience and organise user group
workshops/summits at the major OWASP conferences

3) build SAMM v1.1 or v2.0, based on gathered input on the SAMM mainling
list, project participants and the SAMM user group meetings,

This would include linking in other OWASP projects (see
https://www.owasp.org/images/8/8f/Setting_up_a_Secure_Development_Life_Cycle_with_OWASP_-_Seba_Deleersnyder.pptx)
and integrating the material that has been published on
www.opensamm.orgsince the first version of SAMM.


Together with Pravir and Samantha we agreed on a project leadership
transfer.

Pravir will stay on as co-lead. Other co-leaders will be Kuai Hinojosa and
Bart De Win.

Colin Watson also indicated to want to participate in the project.


I will set up a doodle for a kick-off gotomeeting call in the coming weeks.

Looking at the interest shown last November:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2012-November/thread.html I hope to
have your active participation as project co-lead, contributor or reviewer
in the coming year!


Kind regards,

Seba

Great to see.  I thought that I responded a couple of times, but I don't
see it in the archives.  Perhaps I didn't spam the list with my 'me too'
reply ;)

As someone who has endeavored to and advocated the use of OpenSAMM in a
variety of consulting engagements to establish or improve infosec/appsec
programs, I would humbly suggest that efforts be focused in some small
part to curating and encouraging tools (or showing how tools could be
used) as quality gates in the OpenSAMM model.

Advocacy is great and all, but our whole industry has a severe problem
with creating useful open process that could be dropped in at various
stages to encourage people to do their jobs better.  Usually, I find, no
one has a vested interest to do so, but rather, they tie it up in a
proprietary offering of product and/or service.

In my experience, this isn't the way to see good process made; it needs
to be driven internally and not with paywalled compliance standards,
certifications, WAF appliances, periodic appscans, point-in-time code
audits or any of the like.

Cheers,

Seba,

The statistics of contributions to this mailing list i.e. Google

  Colin - 175
  Seba - 28 note "me too" e-mails
  Bart - 19

The statistics of contributions to opensamm.org "site:opensamm.org
[Insert Name]"

  Colin - 28, also note http://www.opensamm.org/author/cwatson/
  Bart - 7
  Seba - 1

Also, I would welcome "Kuai Hinojosa" to provide list his
contributions which are not in the public domain as I am aware that
Bart has made a number of contributions to OpenSAMM in the background
too.

It is quite clear from the above that Colin should be considered the
preferred candidate and I would therefore like the disclosure of how
this decision was reached considering the conflict of interest with
you duties as an OWASP Board Member?

Hi Christian,

This decision was reached  by simply asking the people involved and through
consensus.
There is no conflict of interest with me being a board member and a project
leader.

Furthermore I count on positive contributions to this project and mailing
list, otherwise I will activate moderation.

regards

Seba

Great news. I am pleased to offer my time to support you, Kuai, Bart,
and all the other contributors with revitalising SAMM.

Hi,
great news Seba!

I gave my support for SAMM v1.0 and I used the framework to give some real assessments. I'd like to contribute again to improve the model. 

As I said to Pravir, I think the key point of the Sw Assurance is 
the fixing process. That's vital for every organization.
As we know that bugs are expected, the most important information 
is how the Company implements the fixes (fix responsability, time of exposure, recheck process). That's should be great to add next version.
What do you think?

Thanks,
Mat

Great stuff Seba, let's take this OWASP project to the next level.

The areas I would like to see some more action is in the data collection,
massaging and visualisation.

I remember that there is an Spreedsheet and XSL about OpenSamm, has it
evolved into a Tool (or Website)

Seba -



I want to offer to support you guys as a contributor or reviewer in the comming year.  I recently used the model for an  evaluation on a government agency contract and found it very useful.



Let me know how I can get involved to support the initiative.

Subject: [SAMM] OWASP SAMM - project reboot and change of leadership


Hi,

During the last month I have exchanged emails/calls with Pravir, Samantha and lots of other people who have supported SAMM in the past.

SAMM (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model) is an important OWASP project and needs an active project team to push it to the next level and maintain it in the future.


I will take over the OWASP SAMM project leadership for 2013 with as main objectives:

1) build a list of (reference) organisations that use SAMM

2) create a SAMM user group to exchange experience and organise user group workshops/summits at the major OWASP conferences

3) build SAMM v1.1 or v2.0, based on gathered input on the SAMM mainling list, project participants and the SAMM user group meetings,

This would include linking in other OWASP projects (see https://www.owasp.org/images/8/8f/Setting_up_a_Secure_Development_Life_Cycle_with_OWASP_-_Seba_Deleersnyder.pptx) and integrating the material that has been published on www.opensamm.org<http://www.opensamm.org> since the first version of SAMM.


Together with Pravir and Samantha we agreed on a project leadership transfer.

Pravir will stay on as co-lead. Other co-leaders will be Kuai Hinojosa and Bart De Win.

Colin Watson also indicated to want to participate in the project.


I will set up a doodle for a kick-off gotomeeting call in the coming weeks.

Looking at the interest shown last November: http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2012-November/thread.html I hope to have your active participation as project co-lead, contributor or reviewer in the coming year!


Kind regards,

Seba
