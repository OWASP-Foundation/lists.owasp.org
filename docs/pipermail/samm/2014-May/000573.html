<PRE>All,

We are excited to announce that our OpenSAMM training has been selected as
part of the OWASP training next month in Cambridge: &quot;Bootstrap and improve
your SDLC with OpenSAMM&quot;.

You can find a detailed description of the training below.

The one-day OpenSAMM training is on Wednesday 25-June.
The registration link and schedule are available online:
<A HREF="https://2014.appsec.eu/conference-schedule/">https://2014.appsec.eu/conference-schedule/</A>

If you have any questions on the training, do not hesitate to contact Bart
or myself.

See you in Cambridge next month,

Kind regards,

Seba

Training: Bootstrap and improve your SDLC with OpenSAMM

Building security into the software development and management practices of
a company can be a daunting task.
There are many elements to the equation: company structure, different
stakeholders, technology stacks, tools and processes, and so forth.
Implementing software assurance can have a significant impact on the
organisation. Yet, trying to achieve this without a good framework is most
likely leading to just marginal and unsustainable improvements.
OWASP OpenSAMM gives you a structural and measurable framework to do just
that.
It enables you to formulate and implement a strategy for software security
that is tailored to the risk profile of your organisation.

The goal of this one-day training, which is conceived as a mix of training
and workshop, is for the participants to get a more in-depth view on and
practical feeling of the OpenSAMM model.
The training is setup in three different parts.

In a first part, an overview is presented of the OpenSAMM model and
similarities and differences with other similar models are explained.
The different domains (governance, construction, verification, deployment),
their activities and relations are explained.
Furthermore, different constituent elements (e.g., metrics) are discussed
and the overall usage scenarios of the model are explained.

Next, approx. half a day will be spent on doing an actual OpenSAMM
evaluation of your own organisation (or one that you have worked for).
We will go through an evaluation of all the OpenSAMM domains and discuss
the results in group. This will give all participants a good indication of
the organisation's maturity wrt. software assurance.
In the same effort, we will define a target model for your organisation and
identify the most important challenges in getting there.

The final part of the training will be dedicated to specific questions or
challenges that you are facing wrt. secure development in your
organisation. In this group discussion, experience  between the different
participants will be shared to address these questions.

In case you haven't started a secure software initiative in your
organisation yet, this training should provide you with the necessary
foundations and ideas to do so. Be prepared for a highly effective and
applicable treatment of this large domain ! And in case you would be
concerned about confidentiality issues, we adhere to the Chatham House
Rule.

Requirements:
This training requires a good amount of interactivity and common-sense.
No specific technical requirements are set forth.
