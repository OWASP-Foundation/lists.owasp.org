<PRE>I use SAMM often to bench-mark an org; and what would really be useful to me is if we could turn it into a tool; that people could use to self-audit and for the 'stats' to update in real time. In this way the document would be living; but also it could contain historical measurements as well; allowing one to see their progress or impact over-time; and also measure trajectory toward their goals. I imagine a kind of web-app for this - but do not know what it would look like. Is anybody else interested in such a tool?

As luck would have it &#8211; we have created a web app called ThreadFix that does just this. And it is available free under a Mozilla license. Currently in open beta.

Check out:
<A HREF="https://code.google.com/p/threadfix/">https://code.google.com/p/threadfix/</A>

The app lets you divide your organization into teams and (among other things) evaluate those teams for SAMM maturity based on the excellent interview spreadsheets put together by Nick Coblentz:

One thing I will say is that this capability in the app has probably received less testing than some of the other, potentially sexier functionality. However if folks are interested in an OpenSAMM app I can probably get some more engineering resources on it. Folks can submit bugs/feature requests here:
<A HREF="https://code.google.com/p/threadfix/issues/list">https://code.google.com/p/threadfix/issues/list</A>

I&#8217;ll see if we can get a wiki page up with a tutorial on the OpenSAMM functionality in the next day or so and post that up to the list for folks who want to try it out. Love to hear any feedback!

Thanks,

Dan
