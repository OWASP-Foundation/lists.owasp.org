<PRE>Hey Joe.

As Colin &amp; Christian mentioned, BSIMM is a periodically updates survey that captures what companies say they're doing about software security. My general rule of thumb was to use OpenSAMM for organizations that were fairly immature and/or jut getting started with software security. For organizations that were more sophisticated (say maybe a year or two in to a software security program), BSIMM provided some rough data to measure the organization against. 

For a while I was really tempted to try to produce similar types of BSIMM stats against SAMM, but I stopped since I consider it harmful after seeing a few pathological organizations that are striving to hit BSIMM averages (because of know-nothing execs blindly chasing metrics) as opposed to practicing good risk management and making intelligent trade-off decisions that are relevant to the specifics of their organization. SAMM clearly sides with the latter group... You know your org, you make the calls.

&gt;<i> We are currently looking to use SAMM as the basis for an assessment of the software security program at one of our large retail clients.  Our client has asked us if anyone has done any kind of benchmarking of SAMM maturity across various companies and industries.  If so, could you direct us to this?  If not, have any of the software security vendors produced anything that you are aware of that can be cited?
