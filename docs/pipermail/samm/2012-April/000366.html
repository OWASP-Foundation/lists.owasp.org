<PRE>I'm not sure I followed that entirely, but you're muddling the issues of what's the right granularity of *collection* of data vs *presentation* of data. Most of my comments concern the former as this is, in my opinion, far more fundamentally important since if you have garbage data, no degree of presentation magic makes it useful.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Further, while I haven't looked at the latest BSIMM, the earlier versions all stated

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data, but that's a BSIMM problem and not a general problem with measurement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the org level, so I digress.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BSIMM reflects that some companies are conducting specific advanced
</I>&gt;<i> activities without consideration of the activities at a lower maturity
</I>&gt;<i> level and this is explored within their &quot;Ranking BSIMM3 Activities&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, BSIMM does not reference
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/solutions/dev/index.cfm">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/solutions/dev/index.cfm</A> and this inferred

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, this issue, in the context of CMMI, is directly related to
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSAMM (which BSIMM is based on the beta release) since it does not
