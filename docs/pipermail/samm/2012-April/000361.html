</I>
This low level of granularity might not be of interest to an executive
i.e. the intended audience.

It could be of value to others (e.g. middle management) provided the
issue with the frequency metric could be overcome e.g. fuzzing is
conducted as part of continuous integration and if it fails then what
is the effect on the measurement of future builds (e.g. the next build
of continuous integration) if the initial crash is still outstanding?
The answer would be subjective.

</I>
BSIMM reflects that some companies are conducting specific advanced
activities without consideration of the activities at a lower maturity
level and this is explored within their &quot;Ranking BSIMM3 Activities&quot;.
Furthermore, BSIMM does not reference
<A HREF="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/solutions/dev/index.cfm">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/solutions/dev/index.cfm</A> and this inferred
within <A HREF="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1562220">http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1562220</A>

Therefore, this issue, in the context of CMMI, is directly related to
OpenSAMM (which BSIMM is based on the beta release) since it does not
reflect real world implementation.

</I>&gt;<i> lightweight (a few level 1's). Instead of slicing on risk buckets, sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> we've used line-of-business boundaries. Sometimes both. Sometimes other
</I>&gt;<i> factors (inhouse/outsourced, lots of others potentially).
</I>
This will result in every application development manager accepting
the lower residual risk to ensure that their application ships without
any security controls so that they get their bonus i.e. this is
similar to the executive ulterior motive explored in the prior
message.
