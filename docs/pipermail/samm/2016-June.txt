Subject: [SAMM] Proposed change to toolbox 1.1: in-sheet forward planning
	projections
Message-ID: <CAL3++dcN9b3KD+9LVYXcodofcrviEBv_497UGS9VcAxykK4KTg@mail.gmail.com>

Proposing an addition to the excellent Toolbox spreadsheet.

The intent of the proposed change is to allow the spreadsheet to be
used as a tool for forward planning.

Change: Add additional rows from J17-N17

Like: Target  | Q + 1  |  Q + 2  |  Q + 3  |  Q + 4 (perhaps up to Q
+8) where these boxes represent the current quarter plus 1,2,3
forward.

After completing the current state audit, the user determines the
ultimate target state for each category, filling the appropriate box.

For example, J18 would contain the target state for "Is there a
software security assurance program in place?"

The Guidance boxes can be filled in to note where work should begin
and where it will be completed up to the target completion level.  If
some target levels are + levels like 2+, you could record which of the
additional guidances will be followed and when, as well.

I've utilized the spreadsheet this way several times, it was much
better than figuring it out externally to the document. We could pull
the numbers over into the roadmap chart, too, which is fancier than
I've gotten with it. .

Adam,
I like the sound of this enhancement to the spreadsheet, I'm in the middle
of looking at possible changes for v1.2 and may consider adding this.
If you have a sanitized example you can share, would you send it to me at
brian.glas at gmail.com?

Thanks,
Brian

Brian,

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mJ4XuDGKbT5brwqWzk31xS8NjniYQmo7R_flW1waNn4/edit?usp=sharing

I have it working in Google sheets. You should be able to copy the
file to your own gdrive and edit the copy. I'd definitely be happy if
other people could find ways to make this better.

My main edit is on the Interview tab. The data could be hooked up to
the Roadmap table but I haven't done that yet, if anyone else wants to
take a whack please do.

I also left a comment in the sheet proposing to number the business
functions/practices/guidance items. It's common in audit checklists
and makes the document content easier to refer to from external
documents.

Best regards
Adam Muntner

Adam,
Thanks for the example, I'll look through it and see if we can integrate it
with some of the changes for v1.2.
I think we should be able to wire it into the roadmap as well.

Appreciate the contribution!

Thanks,
Brian
