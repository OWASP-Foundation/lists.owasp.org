<PRE>When I interviewed Gary McGraw for the Cigital Podcast, I asked him a
question that I knew the answer to but felt was important. The question
essentially was: Do you know of any organization that has adopted BSIMM
where the CIO did not come from a developer/technical background? His
answer was no. If we look at the new world, we will see that there are
now more CIOs who haven't written a single line of code or even project
managed an IT project than that have. So, much of the &quot;success&quot; of the
build-it-in crowd, is neither portable across organizations nor likely
to be &quot;quantified&quot; since it was done using intuition. 

 

The ROI on the test it out side has a few advantages:

1.       Build it in, doesn't really have as many tools since it
requires more in the way of individual competency. For example, you can
have a tool like Rational ReqPro to capture misuse/abuse cases but this
is more about capture of all requirements vs. something infosec specific

2.       Where tools do exist, such as Microsoft Threat Modeling, they
lack &quot;auditable&quot; characteristics and tend to be useful only in driving
other conversations. Since MS doesn't license it (in terms of dollars)
there isn't even an ability to tell how frequent it is being used so
that analysts firms such as Gartner/Forrester could report on it

3.       All tools/vendors show positive ROI. If any of it were true, I
could run the entire IT department for a Fortune 100 enterprise by
myself for $1 a year while relaxing on the bench living the four-hour
workweek J Maybe the challenge here is to help people understand the
&quot;financial&quot; truth about web application security. 

 

Maybe we could help mature the build-security-in mindset by better
helping to connect dots? For example, is there merit in connecting a
Threat Modeling to say the OWASP Risk Rating method?

i agree 100%; &quot;test it out&quot; is both a business and a nonsense for all...
but management.

Sure it is highly repeatable; and further, i'm pretty sure that there is
more business to do with &quot;build in&quot; than with &quot;test out&quot;; but, for
convincing stakeholders or top management, testing output is much more
handleable.

i saw many IT projects chose keeping applications at risk, while
conducting assessments for leveraging budget the next year, by showing
off inherent risk to managers, risk and business owners.

Learning curve seems mandatory, and we need base figures, and that's
what i really miss actually..

Likewise, ROI calculators have been given last week by IBM or HP for
their &quot;test out&quot; products, but do we have kind of ROI for &quot;built in&quot;
tools/methodologies?

For instance, very few companies implement security from design phase;
likewise, solution providers miss it too: Microsoft's Threat Modeling
tool seems alone in these earlier phases?

basically, i find SAMM powerful for planning or proving.

It seems to me that the main purpose today is to prove; Appsec therefore
seems, from my point of view, much more often driven by &quot;verification&quot;,
than by &quot;construction&quot; activities..?

We as a profession believe it is cheaper to &quot;build it in&quot; rather than
test it out, however reality is much different. The &quot;test it out&quot; crowd
has penetration testing which you can put in the hands of anyone and
perform point-and-shoot. Likewise, the after it is built &quot;audit&quot; crowd
loves their checklist. Maturity in the build-it-in requires actual
competencies and is a lot less repeatable...

Dear James,

Thank you.

The 80/20 rule you told will certainly fulfill the needs.

About partners, actually most of them shall not proceed to SAMM's
activities to deliver on time/on budget.

First time we talked about penalties for security flaws, we gave in the
SLA assurance level required on ASVS basis, or compliance required with
the Top10. And this seems to make sense for everyone.

Taking the issue by compliance seems to be more effective, as long as
software security still appear counterproductive.

But I will come back later to share some feedback about SAMM.

Thank you again.

MAB
