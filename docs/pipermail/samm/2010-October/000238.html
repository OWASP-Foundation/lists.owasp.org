<PRE>I was interested to see a chapter covering CLASP in Mark Merkow and Laksh Raghanvan's new book &quot;Secure and Resilient Software Development&quot;. This raised some questions about the state of support for CLASP and its roadmap. I was under the impression that CLASP was going to be replaced over time by SAMM: as Pravir called SAMM &quot;CLASP on steroids&quot; at one point. I thought that CLASP was going to be orphaned as a result.

Now I understand that SAMM is at its core a maturity model not a secure SDLC so this was confusing to me at the time and still is confusing. I've been following both mailing lists for some time now (there has been essentially nothing on CLASP in a long time so it hasn't been distracting).CLASP doesn't seem to be actively maintained and isn't keeping up with the other mainline initiatives at OWASP. SAMM has much more momentum behind it, and is a more active project. But I don't see how the two projects will converge.

To be honest I was surprised that a brand new book would reference CLASP. As a software developer looking for a secure SDLC for a reference, it makes a lot more sense to work with Microsoft's SDL than CLASP given that SDL is more current and complete and has a lot more resources and momentum. Is CLASP still alive? And how are CLASP and SAMM supposed to fit together?
