Well, that is the traditional way to view the problem.  And it leads exactly to the situation most companies are in -- continuous vulnerability chasing. 

&gt;<i> Subsequently, an immature development culture will resist a controls
</I>&gt;<i> based approach i.e. ASVS, ESAPI which is the similar to the resistance
</I>&gt;<i> to both ISO 27001 and PCI i.e. controls based.
</I>
There's a difference between compliance and providing actual security mechanisms. ESAPI is succeeding because it makes application security easier - training, rqmts, architecture, implementation, verification, and remediation.  I see no resistance to ESAPI in organization - even immature ones - in fact quite the opposite.

&gt;<i> To me, build-it-in vs. test-it-out is a false dichotomy since you need both.&#160; I think the important distinction is between the positive and negative approaches to application security.&#160; Mostly today organizations are following the negative approach. The focus here, across the lifecycle, is on attacks, abuse cases, vulnerability, impact, and risks. Essentially these organizations are managing insecurity.

The processes above are measuring the inherent risk.

&gt;<i> By contrast, the positive approach focuses on security requirements, establishing controls, verification, completeness, and assurance.&#160; This is where we are heading with ASVS, Developer's Guide, the Prevention Cheat Sheet series, and ESAPI. &#160;This view allows us to manage secure and assurance.

... and the application of these controls adjust the inherent risk to produce the residual risk.

That stated, to implement these controls requires a highly matured development culture.  Otherwise the project manager will accept the residual risk by signing an exception wavier to meet the deadline in order to receive their bonus and by the time the vulnerability are disclosed the project manager has moved on and is therefore unaccountable.

Considering the recent discussion on the lack of acceptance of ASVS at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-application-security-verification-standard/2010-September/thread.html">https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-application-security-verification-standard/2010-September/thread.html</A>
(I have no knowledge of the uptake of ESAPI but Dinis Cruz told me it was very low at HITB Amsterdam 2010 but please clarify if this
incorrect) supports the view above.

&gt;<i> See the difference? &#160;There are so many things that can go wrong that the negative approach doesn't provide much assurance.&#160; The positive approach is simpler to manage because the number of security controls is smaller. &#160;In particular, the verification effort changes from &quot;hacking ourselves secure&quot; to verifying that the proper controls are in place, work correctly, and are used properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not a zealot about this - there's a lot of value in the negative approach to security.&#160; But I think the market is very lopsided today, with virtually all the effort being put towards measuring insecurity and reacting.
</I>
The root cause of this observation in immature development culture and can be correlated by reviewing the:
1. Real world data of the conclusions drawn by BSIMM (i.e. from p49) 2. The activities conducted at Level 1 of both OpenSAMM and BSIMM

Subsequently, an immature development culture will resist a controls based approach i.e. ASVS, ESAPI which is the similar to the resistance to both ISO 27001 and PCI i.e. controls based.

Hence, the approach with the most chance of success is to measure the maturity and then determine what controls will be accepted today or introduced at a later period by the development culture
