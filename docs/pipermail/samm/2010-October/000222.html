&gt;<i> When I interviewed Gary McGraw for the Cigital Podcast, I asked him a question that I knew the answer to but felt was important. The question essentially was: Do you know of any organization that has adopted BSIMM where the CIO did not come from a developer/technical background? His answer was no. If we look at the new world, we will see that there are now more CIOs who haven&#8217;t written a single line of code or even project managed an IT project than that have. So, much of the &#8220;success&#8221; of the build-it-in crowd, is neither portable across organizations nor likely to be &#8220;quantified&#8221; since it was done using intuition.

BSIMM2 doesn't explore the background of the CIO or other types (i.e.
VP Risk, CSO, etc) reporting manager and there is not what to
objectively benchmark &quot;background&quot;.  That stated, BSIMM2 does cover
were the reporting line of the SSG on within the Executive Leadership
i.e. on p6

The CIO role is evolving to that of a CFO and this to manage the
residual risk of the failures to deliver technical project.  Hence
their scope is much greater then the SSG and hence their selection of
their maturity model is different i.e. COBIT, CMMI, etc

&gt;<i> Maybe we could help mature the build-security-in mindset by better helping to connect dots? For example, is there merit in connecting a Threat Modeling to say the OWASP Risk Rating method?
</I>
The failure in trying to adopt specific activities is due to culture
lacking maturity.
