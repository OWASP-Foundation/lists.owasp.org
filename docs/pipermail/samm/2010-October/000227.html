<PRE>1. Catching up on my backlog of reading. Currently reading the ISACA IT Risk Framework and looking at the metrics section where they have broken down metrics into activity and process metrics. Should we have a similar classification scheme?

2. Could someone be really good at software assurance but otherwise have poor showing on ISACA risk? If so, should we provide additional guidance on where good infosec deviates from traditional control thinking? For example, if we decide to put federated identity into a system, yet the audit control framework says look for change password evidence every sixty days...

3. Is there an opportunity for us to get SAMM visually represented into GRC frameworks such as Archer? 

4. Some guidance on how an organization may express risk appetite may be in order. For example, are there types of applications that need a different profile than others (e.g. internet facing, PCI, financial, etc) and that goodness can be had by being less mature vs. being wholesale applied and penalized because the Chinese Lunch ordering system is subject to CSRF

5. Should we have some measure of the maturity of escalation when things decline? Which things are developer-scoped vs. which things are CIO-scoped?

6. Should we somehow be able to merge SAMM with a RACI matrix to understand organizational alignment?
