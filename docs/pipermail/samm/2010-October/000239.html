<PRE>Mike,

Another thought - you might be able to integrate DISA ASD STIG within
&quot;Policy and Compliance&quot; i.e. p39 - p41

&gt;<i> Hey Mike.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just caught up on this thread, and I'm totally in agreement on the value of such DoD extensions (and, for that matter, extensions to any other appsec standard that exists). The original idea was to try to build all of these into SAMM itself. But, after identifying a short list of candidates, it became pretty obvious to me that doing so would make the doc pretty unwieldy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, the latest thought to solve this was to try to pull the mapping and extra details related to a given standard into a &quot;companion guide&quot; of sorts. Think &quot;SAMM Companion for DISA ASD STIG&quot;. What I really like about Mike's &#160;suggestion is that we could organize such a companion doc as a specialized set of levels across the 12 practices. If there is overlap with existing levels and activities, it's easy to make those references into the &quot;core&quot; SAMM material from the companion guide. If there's anything really unique in the external standard (goodness as James puts it), we can work it back into the next release of the SAMM framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another good thing about Mike's suggestion is that we could use the OWASP wiki to build out the specialized levels, then once we're happy with the set of 12, we can spin it into a doc (with a little front matter) and publish to the world. This workflow is kindof key in my opinion since it would allow multiple people to collaborate easily. For instance, we've had a bunch of volunteers offer to map SAMM to PCI, but no one ever crossed the finish line since they were all working independently (and no one ever sent me their partial work to hand to the next person that wants to tackle that task).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm no DISA ASD STIG expert so I'm not sure where to start, but if you want to spearhead it Mike, I'd be glad to help out in any way I can (and try to dig up other volunteers to help out).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also, if anyone wants to take the lead for any of these other standards (or add a new one to the list), please don't be shy!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- PCI-DSS
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- ISO 270xx
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- COBIT
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Various gov't standards
