Thanks, I just grabbed the SAMM-1.0-XML-0.3-en_US.xml which is the latest
version right?

Couple question on this file:

- is there an XSD (Schema) for it?
- is there an XSTL to transform it into other formats (or even the final
book layout)
- is there an editor to edit this data
- Colin, I remember you showing me a graph created from SAMM data. How did
you created it? Was is using data stored in this XML file?
- On the topic of greating graphs from this XML file, where in the XML
element/attributes does the specific data of particular SAMM review goes
into? (I.e. the place to store the multipe phases data and create graphs
like these:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Roadmap_-_Online_Service_Provider)

Thanks

Yes.

No, I don't think so for any of these - Pravir created the file
"somehow"... perhaps an export from Illustrator?

It uses some of the textual data from this file, plus a separate XML
format for data (and XSD and XSLT) to create SVG files.  I haven't
published those yet, as we were hoping to add them to the SAMM blog
first.

The data won't be in this (Pravir's) XML file - that is the content of
the standard, including all the examples.

XML data for a particular organisation will be in a separate file...
and Brenda & I made up an example format.

can you share what you have done so far? (namely the xml, xstl and sample
graph created?)

Since you ask... yes :-)

Sorry, I've been super latent on getting the XML up to the project page for download... I'll get it up there by this weekend, then Colin can blog about the cool stuff he and Brenda developed.

That'll be great.  I was just drafting an email to the list/Dinis...
but will hold off (and go for a beer instead).
