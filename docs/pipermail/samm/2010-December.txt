In reviewing the Assessment Interview Template, I observed that the last
assertion under EG3 related to security activities/gates is not categorized
correctly. It duplicates the first PC3 assertion.

I recommended removing it.

Subject: [SAMM] SAMM in ebook formats
Message-ID: <20101216121625.7767FFEC6@smtp.hushmail.com>

I was thinking about making a publicy available version of the SAMM 
1.0 document that would be readable on ebook readers like Kindle. 
This requires an OPF file with metadata etc which is trivial and 
properly formatted content - from what I've seen plain HTML works 
best.

I started (just to see how it would work) by converting PDF to TXT 
and then reformatting the content in HTML with diagrams as PNG 
images. My questions to the group would be:

1) maybe anyone did that previously? (I found a paperback version 
of SAMM on Amazon, but no ebook)
2) if not, what are your thoughts about myself doing that - and 
maybe there's someone willing to help?
3) can you think of any better source data to start with? (most 
conversions from ODF or PDF I've tried produces content that looks 
ugly on ebook readers though)

The OPF source would be eventually publicly available, so that 
everyone can convert it to whatever format they use (EPUB, MOBI).

Pawel, I not only think this is an absolutely brilliant idea for SAMM but believe that the OWASP Developers Guide, Code Review Guide and Testing Guide should be converted to an OPF file so as to become Kindle enabled as well...

Pawe?

Would the XML file be an easier starting point?  It's on the SAMM
downloads page.

Colin, 

I've looked at the XML and a simple Python script can convert it 
into both content and metadata for any ebook format. XML version is 
great, as updated version would just require re-run of the script 
to produce new book version.

OWASP guides, as mentioned by James, would require more manual work 
but their browsable versions are quite well structured HTML, which 
is easy to reformat into ebook.

Give me some a couple of weeks and I'll come back with some drafts.

Oh that's good. At some time the file may be updated as you say, or
someone might do a translation of v1.0 - is XSLT another possibility?

Not sure if XSL can  convert one XML into content XHTML and 
metadata XML (OPF). If yes, then it would probably do the job as 
well.
