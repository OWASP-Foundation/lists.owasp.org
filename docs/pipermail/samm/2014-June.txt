Dear all,

We will participate in the OWASP Summit leading up to the training /
conference in Cambridge in a couple of weeks:
https://2014.appsec.eu/the-owasp-project-summit/

The OpenSAMM workshop is scheduled on Monday 23-June 16h-18h.
The meeting agenda is available here:

If you plan to attend, please add yourself to the agenda or let us know
directly?

Also: don't forget we have an OpenSAMM training planned for Tuesday 24-June.
The setup will be interactive, so we need a minimum number of attendees to
proceed with this training. If you plan to attend, do not hesitate to
reserve your seat online here:
https://2014.appsec.eu/registering-for-the-conference/

Looking forward to meet you in Cambridge!

Kind regards,

Seba
