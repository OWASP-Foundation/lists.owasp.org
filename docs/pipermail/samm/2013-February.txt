Hoi Seba,

Had er graag erbij willen zijn, maar aanstaande donderdag kan ik helaas
niet.
Zelf heb ik weinig tijd om hieraan mee te werken, maar zal het in de gaten
houden :D

Succes,

Hi,

I was trying to get connected but  there is nobody online. Wasn?t it 18:00 CET?

 

In any case...I wanted to share this info with you:

 

The Network of Excellence on Engineering Secure Future Internet Software Services and Systems (NESSoS) is an on-going EU project aiming  at constituting and integrating a long lasting research community on engineering secure software-based services and systems.
This project (see http://www.nessos-project.eu/ <http://www.nessos-project.eu/> ) is now entering in its third year and we are looking for new members of industrial advisory board (IAB).

 

Description of NESSOS IAB:   

The members of the Advisory Board will receive periodically (approx once every 3 months) an e-mail with an update of the status of the project, relevant events, etc.

The members of the Advisory Board are welcome, although not obliged, to comment on issues such as the research roadmap, strategy or potential direction of the project.

The members of the Advisory Board will be invited to NESSOS Annual Forum events and their travel and hotel costs will be reimbursed by the project coordinator. 

The members of the Advisory board act with the knowledge and experience of the positions they occupy in their companies/institutions, but their comments and opinions will only be interpreted as their personal ones (and not reflecting their current companies/institutions).

 

If you are interested to join IAB please contact Aljosa Pasic : Aljosa.pasic at atos.net

	Hi,

	During the last month I have exchanged emails/calls with Pravir, Samantha and lots of other people who have supported SAMM in the past.

	SAMM (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model) is an important OWASP project and needs an active project team to push it to the next level and maintain it in the future.

	 

	I will take over the OWASP SAMM project leadership for 2013 with as main objectives:

	1) build a list of (reference) organisations that use SAMM

	2) create a SAMM user group to exchange experience and organise user group workshops/summits at the major OWASP conferences

	3) build SAMM v1.1 or v2.0, based on gathered input on the SAMM mainling list, project participants and the SAMM user group meetings, 

	This would include linking in other OWASP projects (see https://www.owasp.org/images/8/8f/Setting_up_a_Secure_Development_Life_Cycle_with_OWASP_-_Seba_Deleersnyder.pptx) and integrating the material that has been published on www.opensamm.org since the first version of SAMM.

	 

	Together with Pravir and Samantha we agreed on a project leadership transfer.

	Pravir will stay on as co-lead. Other co-leaders will be Kuai Hinojosa and Bart De Win.

	Colin Watson also indicated to want to participate in the project.

	 

	I will set up a doodle for a kick-off gotomeeting call in the coming weeks.

	Looking at the interest shown last November: http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2012-November/thread.html I hope to have your active participation as project co-lead, contributor or reviewer in the coming year!

	 

	Kind regards,

	Seba

Message-ID: <CAAihoGujk8FWj2pyLc3hN5tzHWwupxhdedLCwkZhFGPxkiH0hw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

To structure requirements for the next SAMM version, I have started a
template:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1moVO8xS6TInq1xBzvZh73LcVV0ObFZbMA_c-oI8JRpQ/edit

This first document means to identify questions/topics to collect data
around potential SAMM improvements. This will serve to
1) build questionnaires for the SAMM user groups
2) have categories to group SAMM improvements in

You can send me your input or directly or add it to the online document.
I will leave this section open until 8-Mar, after which i will setup a call
to discuss & complete this part.

If you already have particular SAMM improvement suggestions: feel free to
1) suggest them on the mailing list for discussion
2) send them to me
3) or add them to the 2nd part of the document

thanks for your input!

kind regards

Seba
