I'd love to get you (and anyone else interested in helping) more involved. Specifically on your points:

1) Would the need for a security library fit under Secure Architecture? I definitely had that in mind when putting that part together... At level 1 you use recommended libraries, and then up at level 3, you customize and mandate them. How else were you thinking we'd emphasize this?

2) I definitely want to do this. That's why I syndicated all the content on the owasp.org site so that people could link things in as much as possible (and then in the next release, we could write it in directly based on the assembled content from the wiki).

3) I'm not sure what you mean by 'key security areas' so I'm not sure how to respond to this one. I've got a diagram that maps the Security Practices to phases in a generic SDLC and I'm thinking that might be good content to include in the next version, is that what you mean?

Thanks!

p.

Pravir,

I'd like to augment SAMM in a few ways:

1) Discuss the need for a security library (this is stage 1 IMO for a  
mature secure software process)
2) Link-in other OWASP projects where appropriate (code review guide,  
ESAPI, etc)
3) Refer to key security areas and where in the SDLC they are most  
likely addressed

Are you down? I don't want to mess with your painting - SAMM is  
awesome! But I would like to jump in...

Respectfully,
Jim

Cool, Pravir.

I see what all of the content is under the OWASP Wiki - very nice! I'll make 
a few changes and point you to what I've  changed to make sure we are all 
still on the same page.

Thanks for making all of SAMM part of the OWASP Wiki, nice work.

Aloha,
Jim

Along those same lines, you may want to consider including this
interview template within SAMM or the Wiki too:

For the most part, it simple adds bullet points to clarify each
self-assessment worksheet question already in the SAMM document.

This is excellent work, Nick. I'll add this in somewhere when I start 
messin' with SAMM, soon. I'll keep Pravir in the loop, too.

Cheers,
Jim

Yeah, I really like the info that Nick put together. What do you guys think is the best way to incorporate it?

So far, beside the Interview Checklist, we also have a MS Project file for planning out SAMM activities, so we could make an extra section on the website for 'Tools' or 'Resources'. On the other hand, we could take something like the checklist and build it into the next release of SAMM somehow. Or we could do something in between since there's a lot of value in having a spreadsheet for actually doing the interviews and I wouldn't want to lose that.

Perhaps for this phase just stick it in a "tools" section for now as a  
great start.
