hi sc-l,

Today we released BSIMM4, the fourth edition of the BSIMM model built
directly from data observed in 51 firms.  If you ever wonder what
software assurance looks like in commercial practice (and how to
measure it), the BSIMM sheds plenty of light on current practice.

BSIMM4 provides insight into fifty-one of the most successful software
security initiatives in the world and describes how these initiatives
evolve, change, and improve over time. The multi-year study is based
on in-depth measurement of leading enterprises including Adobe, Aon,
Bank of America, Box, Capital One, The Depository Trust & Clearing
Corporation (DTCC), EMC, F-Secure, Fannie Mae, Fidelity, Google,
Intel, Intuit, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Mashery, McKesson, Microsoft,
Nokia, Nokia Siemens Networks, QUALCOMM, Rackspace, Salesforce, Sallie
Mae, SAP, Scripps Networks, Sony Mobile, Standard Life, SWIFT,
Symantec, Telecom Italia, Thomson Reuters, Vanguard, Visa, VMware,
Wells Fargo, and Zynga.

Some numerical highlights of BSIMM4:
? BSIMM4 includes 51 firms from 12 industry verticals
? BSIMM4 has grown 20% since BSIMM3 and is ten times bigger than the
original 2009 edition
? The BSIMM4 data set has 95 distinct measurements (some firms
measured multiple times, some firms with multiple divisions measured
separately and rolled into one firm score)
? BSIMM4 continues to show that leading firms on average employ two
full time software security specialists for every 100 developers
? BSIMM4 describes the work of 974 software security professionals
working with a development-based satellite of 2039 people to secure
the software developed by 218,286 developers

Of particular interest to readers of sc-l, for the first time in the
BSIMM project, new activities were observed in addition to the
original 109, resulting in the addition of two new activities to the
model going forward. The activities are: Simulate software crisis and
Automate malicious code detection.

As always, your feedback is welcome.

I have split this thread off due to its relevance to OpenSAMM and BSIMM.

OpenSAMM and BSIMM are both related to http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/
and I have CCed the OpenSAMM OWASP Mailing List and BCC Gary McGraw,
Brian Chess and Sammy Migues (the authors of BSIMM) for their
respective comment.

I would prefer to make not make a recommendation for either BSIMM and
OpenSAMM as I would consider that to be a conflict of interest but
have published an objective view of their slight differences within
http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/bsammbo which has been reviewed by both
BSIMM and OpenSAMM.

Both OpenSAMM and BSIMM have not direct relationship to the SDL, aside
from attempting to measure its maturity and
http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/learn/assess.aspx might be more
relevant to your proposal.

However, I believe that OpenSAMM, BSIMM and/or the SDL Development
Model would made as a recommendation within the report based on the
OWASP Testing Guide.
