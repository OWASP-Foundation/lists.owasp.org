Subject: [SAMM] Internal Application Security Portals Part 1
Message-ID: <4A4D148A.80504@gmail.com>

Software assurance maturity models like SAMM and BSIMM recommend
implementing a portal within organizations to promote secure software
development.  I wrote a blog post about what types of information should
be included in such a portal.  This first of several posts covers
providing basic resources and guidance.  Process and project related
information will be covered in future posts.

I welcome any feedback, here is a link to the post:

Hi there,

i discovered the SAMM-framework some weeks ago,
and since i have to deal a lot with software-development,
from small-scale to large-scale, im always interested in
security-stuff, and the SAMM-Stuff is really
great; nice work!

I just wondered if it is planned or already in
production to translate the paperwork into
other languages


with regards,

If a translation in French is welcomed, I can help.

Hi all,

A few weeks back I had some discussions on the mailing list with
Pravir and Colin, among others. I've been very busy in work since then
but (a little later than I hoped!) I've now attached a Word document
with some comments and suggested feedback. It outlines the experience
that my colleagues (Eoin Keary & Rahim Jina) and I have had with SAMM
on a number of recent engagements.

I hope the feedback helps and feel free to come back to me for
clarification if needs be!

Thanks,

Aidan

Aidan,

To address your feedback for item 1, take a look at the following
spreadsheet created to support the SAMM worksheet questions:

Nice work Nick.that is very useful.

I hope we can integrate our (Aidan/ Rahim /Me) comments into SAMM 1.1
it would be useful for the list to kick around the comments to see if they
fit.

Awesome feedback! Most of it is super actionable, so unless there's an
objection, I'll throw together a SEP for it and just roll it into the
assessment worksheets for the next version.

For translations, my hope was to get InDesign to spit out a nice XML file
with all the content (separated from the design/layout). But, that's proved
to be difficult since I made some poor design decisions in constructing the
document and
now I've got to go back and change a lot of the layout to make it work.
The good news is that I'm committed to getting it done, I just need to find
the time to do it. In the mean time, is it too much of a pain to start the
translation work from the PDF? I'm thinking we can just dump translated text
into a separate Word file and I'll merge it all together once I get the
workflow down.

I also have a Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese version of
the SAMM Beta so that'll save lots of time for anyone interested in
picking up that translation task.

Any volunteers for different languages?

Yes, we had a router crash at the hosting provider so the site is offline for now. I'm told it should be back online by this evening with some luck. I'll post a message here when it's live again.

Sorry for the inconvenience!

Hey Everyone.
The busted router has been vanquished and everyone should be able to get to
http://OpenSAMM.org now.
