<PRE>McGovern's sporadic brain dump of thoughts in making SAMM better (?)


I am of the school of thought that says we need to serve both external
and internal auditors equally. External auditors will look at the
maturity of the organization at large where an internal auditor may look
at the divisions, departments, particular teams, etc.

Is there a difference in auditing a software development effort for a
large enterprise when development is internal vs. when it is 100%
outsourced in an offshore model? What aspects of maturity are transitive
between business partners and what aspects are separate?

Does the SecurityCompass work call out the need to better specify how
auditors as a role play within SAMM?

There are a few things hinted at within PCI that we should also
consider. Should we figure out how to ask: Is the software development
methodology well understood by the engineers building the software? This
is more than general enthusiasm but trends into correlation techniques
amongst interviewees/samples.

How do we account for clarity when roles are defined by team members?
Think specializing generalist.

Should maturity have some notion of the real-world impact to failing a
phased gate review?

Can we address buildability of software? Is a developer required to do
say static analysis before checking in?

Should test plans be reviewed outside of QA (and not the repeat-after-me
business buy-in)

Is there an ideal ratio between functional and negative testing?

If there is maturity, how can we measure the scalability of the process?
