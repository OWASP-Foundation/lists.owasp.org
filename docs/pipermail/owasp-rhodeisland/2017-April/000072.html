Hey everyone!

Sorry for the super long layoff, I have been slacking in scheduling our
meetings, but we're back on! We will have our next meeting on Wednesday,
April 12th at 6:30 pm at Upserve, 10 Dorrance St. in Providence.

As for the OWASP meeting:

Using Instrumentation and Sensors to drive Optimization in your Application
Security Program

In our physical world, we have instrumentation all around us. Clocks tell
us time, kitchen ovens tell us temperature, cars tell us speed, fuel level
and even has onboard health diagnostics. At our homes, we have security
alerts when someone trespasses our property or opens a door. However, in
the world of software, we have very little visibility into what is going on
inside the software. Our presenters will describe how instrumentation can
be used to enable your software applications to both detect vulnerabilities
and block attacks. Furthermore, they will demonstrate the insights offered
by using instrumentation and why this approach can offer unique insights to
your security program.

Bio: Jon Seidman has been a software developer for more than a decade. He
has special interest in web related technologies and application security.
He has a Master&#8217;s degree in computer science, and is a CISSP. He currently
works for Contrast Security, where he evangelizes their technology.

Hope to see you there!
