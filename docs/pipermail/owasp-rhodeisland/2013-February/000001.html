<PRE>Monday, March 4, 6 pm, we'll do another round of Hands on Hacking! We'll go
over topics like SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS), what they
are, what can be done with them and of course, ways to prevent these in
your applications.

First and foremost, this is intended to be educational for developers.
We're not training the &quot;black hats&quot;. We want developers to be aware of what
can happen and use OWASP's own suggested techniques for more secure code.
Please bring your laptop that has the ability to connect wirelessly in
order to participate in the hands-on portion. (or you might get kinda bored)

Additionally, I believe the best way to learn things is in three steps:
Learn It, Do It, Teach It. I'm going to be doing the presenting using this
and this is me on the third step. Please bring your expectations
accordingly. I'm no world-renowned rock-star expert on this stuff. I'm
willing to share what I know and would like to make this interactive and
collaborative with you. If you know something that others don't, please
share it.

This meeting is this coming Monday night, 6 pm at Swipely's headquarters.
Use 566 South Main Street, Providence as the address to find it in Google
maps. It's between Al Forno and the Shell gas station in the brick building
with the billboard on its roof. Swipely is generously providing
refreshments as well.

We don't currently have a presenter for next month, so if you have
something you'd like to talk about, please let me know.

If you don't want to receive these notifications in the future, you can
either email me and I'll remove you or your can remove yourself here:
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-rhodeisland">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-rhodeisland</A> (or forward that
link to others who *want* to be notified)

As always, OWASP RI meetings are open to anyone and free for everyone.
Please bring friends and colleagues, the more the merrier!

Any questions, comments, thoughts or even just ramblings, please send those
on over, and we'll see you Monday night!

Thank you.

Patrick
