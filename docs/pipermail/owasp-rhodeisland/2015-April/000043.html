<PRE>Hi All,

I just wanted to let you all know that our next meeting will be on Monday,
May 11 at 6:30 pm at the headquarters of Congressman James Langevin in
Warwick. The address is 300 Centerville Rd, #200 in Warwick. This is a one
time thing, we will be back at Swipely in Providence for future meetings.

Congressman Langevin is the Chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity
Committee and he will be our guest speaker this month to tell us about the
state of US Cybersecurity. With so many issues in the news, I don't think
we'll have any shortage of conversation!

I have closed the RSVPs as I was told the room has never held more than 30
people and that's where the RSVPs currently are. If you cannot attend,
please change your RSVP so someone else on the waitlist may attend.

We are still finalizing future meetings, as I had interested from one
presenter for June, and I think we are also due for another hackathon going
forward. My thought there is that I may create a VM with Samurai WTF and
Mutillidae/NOWASP on it, go over a couple techniques and then have people
hack away at their own VM instance on their own laptops.

If anyone else would like to present or has ideas for presentations, please
let me know.

Thank you and we'll see you on May 11th!

Patrick
