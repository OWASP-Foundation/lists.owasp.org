Hi all!

Our next OWASP RI meeting is in one week! We will have Velu Jeganathan
talking about the Las Vegas conferences from this summer. We may also have
a short talk on web proxy tools, like Burp Suite and Zed Attack Proxy.

The meeting is Tuesday, Sept 15 at 6:30 pm at 10 Dorrance Street in
Providence, Swipely's headquarters. Swipely generously provides pizza and
beverages for our meetings as well.

We will also have an exciting meeting next month, based off a request. We
will have a talk on penetration testing with Larry Pesce. This meeting will
be on Tuesday, October 6. Larry has years of experience at doing all types
of security testing and he teaches the SANS class "Wireless Ethical
Hacking, Penetration Testing and Defenses".

Lastly, the Boston Application Security Conference is seeing presenters. If
you've ever wanted to present, this is a great conference to get started
with. The link to submit your presentation is

examples from his own experiences. You can also hear Larry weekly on the
Paul's Security Weekly podcast, for which Larry is a co-creator and
co-host.
