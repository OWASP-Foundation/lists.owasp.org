Our next OWASP RI meeting will be next week, August 13, 6:30 pm at Swipely,
10 Dorrance Street in Providence. Please RSVP if you plan to come so we can
get your name on the list at the security desk. Either an email response
here or use the Meetup.com site:
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/events/197519842/

Topic is "How Hackers View Your Web Site". As developers, we look at a web
site usually just one way, how it should work and what it should do.
However hackers look at it differently, they try to figure out what else it
can do. They poke and prod at every possible vector looking for a single
way in to compromise a site. In this talk, we'll look at many of the
possibilities and different ways that attackers try to hack your site.

We thank Swipely for hosting and providing refreshments.

Also, AppSecUSA, OWASP's annual national conference is coming up in Denver
and is September 16-19. You can get more info at www.appsecusa.org.

We'll keep the announcement short this month and please just RSVP to this
email or the Meetup site if you plan to attend. See you next week!
