Abstract and Why This Topic is Important: Doxxing is the Internet-based
practice of researching and broadcasting personally identifiable
information about an individual. It is also a scourge on our internet lives
that can quickly boil over into the physical realm. Often wielded as a
weapon of hate or manipulation and a tactic for intimidation doxxing easily
leads to real-world threats of violence, financial harm, sexual assault,
career damage, or even murder. Examples of these impacts can be seen
surrounding the recent events of 'GamerGate' through the targeting of Anita
Sarkeesian, Felicia Day, Tara Long, and Brianna Wu. Doxxing also often
leads to another tragic outcome; that of targets for hate being
misidentified leading to unaffiliated individuals becoming the subjects of
attack. Occurrences of this can be found in such online sagas as Anonymous
vs. Scientology, the Amanda Todd case, and the incorrect fingering of Sunil
Tripathi as the Boston Bomber. Given the real world impacts of being doxxed
what can we do to protect ourselves, our friends, and our loved ones? In
this talk I will highlight common methods employed by doxxers as well as
methods to safeguard the information they seek. I will move from the easy
wins and low-hanging fruit, with an eye for practicality, to the more
complex and long-term defenses employed by professionals. While this is a
pertinent topic for everyone I believe it is especially important for those
who's livelihoods involve spending copious amounts of time interacting with
the internet. Our Doxxing attack surfaces are larger than those for others.

Bio: Benjamin Brown currently works on systems safety, adversarial
resilience, and threat intelligence at Akamai Technologies. He has
experience in the non-profit, academic, and corporate worlds as well as
degrees in both Anthropology and International Studies. Research interests
include novel and side-channel attack vectors, radio systems, the
psychology and anthropology of information security, metacognitive
techniques, threat actor profiling, intelligence analysis, and thinking
about security as an ecology of complex systems.
