A few months ago, I asked the group what topics they'd like to hear more
about, and one person shouted out "Armitage!", so here we go, we got a talk
on Metasploit and Armitage. This will be a talk from the ground up, what
they're for, how to use them, and so on. Bring your questions, bring your
ideas and Rob Kornmeyer will be with us to tell us all about it.

October 15th, 6:30 pm, 10 Dorrance Street, 9th Floor

As always, Swipely will be generously hosting and providing the
refreshments.

Please RSVP by either replying to this email or join our Meetup.com group
