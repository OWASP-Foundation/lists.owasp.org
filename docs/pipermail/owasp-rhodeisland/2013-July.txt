Hi all!

Hope you're having a great summer.

We are keeping a lookout for a presenter for August, but we will have a
meeting in September, and likely the rest of the fall months. We will have
a meeting on Monday, September 23, 5:45 pm at Swipely (39 Pike Street,
Providence)

The details on the presenter and the topic will be coming very soon, but I
wanted to get the word out for people to mark their calendars.

Happy secure web apps!

Patrick Laverty
OWASP Rhode Island
