Our final meeting of 2015 will be on November 3, 6:30 pm at Swipely, 10
Dorrance St. in Providence. We will have Kellen Kleinfelter talk to us
about Account Checkers and Rewards Program Abuses. He will tell us about
how attackers get access to our accounts and what they do with them. He
will show us some of the typical defenses and better practices against this
type of attack. Please RSVP for this meeting by either replying to this
email or on our meetup page:
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/events/225558323/

We will also have a brief talk by Amber Lee about the three types of XSS.

As always, this meeting is sponsored by Swipely, who generously provide the
location, the food and drinks.

There will be no meeting in December, enjoy the end of the year and we will
have another meeting in January with lots of great stuff in 2016!

Thank you!
