<PRE>Hey everyone, we're back! And we've got a great lineup for you the next few
months.  Our next meeting is Monday, September 23 at 6 pm. Our location is
Swipely at 39 Pike Street in Providence. If you know where Al Forno is, off
Wickenden St, Swipely is in the building in the median between Al Forno and
the gas station.

Our speaker this month is Brown University researcher Ben Lerner. Here is
his talk title, outline and bio:

JavaScript Verification: From Browsers to Pages

Modern web browsers implement a &quot;private browsing&quot; mode that is intended to
leave behind no traces of a user's browsing activity on their computer.
This feature is in direct tension with support for *extensions*, which let
users add third-party functionality into their browser.  I will discuss the
scope of this problem, present our approach to verifying extensions'
compliance with private browsing mode, and sketch our findings on several
real, third-party extensions.  I will then briefly describe the toolkit
underlying our approach, and end with a sketch of a newer project, adapting
this approach to the very different-seeming problem of statically catching
errors when using the jQuery library.

Bio:  Benjamin Lerner is a post-doctoral researcher in the PLT group at
Brown University, and soon to be a lecturer at Northeastern University.
His research examines the challenges of analyzing client-side web
programming, from the behavior of web pages down through the semantics of
the browser.  He received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of
Washington in 2011, building a platform to analyze conflicts between
browser extensions, and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from
Yale University.

=================

In upcoming months, we also have Ben Jackson and Allison Nixon on tap to
come on back and present.

Additionally, if you're a little north of Providence, you may also want to
check out the OWASP Boston meetings, held up in Cambridge, MA, usually on
the first Wednesday night of the month. I'll send out a notice when I hear
the October meeting being scheduled.

Meeting space and refreshments for our meeting are provided by Swipely.

I don't know if the listserv will allow attachments through, but if you see
an .ics file, that is from me for this meeting.

Thanks and see you on the 23rd!

Patrick
