Hey everyone, we have our June meeting coming up. It will be June 11 at
6:30 pm at Swipely, 10 Dorrance Street, 9th floor. Please RSVP to me to
expedite getting past the security desk. Also, we added yet another means
of communication. We're now on Meetup.com!
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

All OWASP meetings are free and open to anyone. Spread the word!

We also have a July meeting scheduled, which you can see below, but if you
want to present in August, we'd love to have you! So here are the details
for June!

June 11, 6:30 pm
Title: Running a non-attributable honeypot system via fly by night VPS
providers

Description: Ben "@innismir" Jackson will talk about cheap VPS providers
and how they make great homes for honeypots in which you can monitor the
ankle biters that poke at your network day in and day out.

Speaker Bio: Ben spends his time enjoying being a husband, dad, and messing
around with anything that has a button on it. He was the author for
"Asterisk Hacking" from Syngress, has spoken at various conferences, and
has appeared on various media outlets discussing security and privacy. Ben
strongly dislikes Thursdays and writing about himself in the third person.

So please RSVP to me and thank you to Swipely for hosting, as pizza and
drinks are provided!

On July 16, we'll have Milandon Foley talking about Point of Sale (POS)
breaches!

Thank you and see you on June 11th!
