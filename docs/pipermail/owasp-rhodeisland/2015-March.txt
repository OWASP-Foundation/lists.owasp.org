Subject: [Owasp-rhodeisland] OWASP RI: Hacking Ruby Gems, March 18
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEDyY=DrUR7hEnWxWZ9zL=+ryF8oZ4s_7NZomA1=wo_XMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Our next OWASP RI meeting will be on Wednesday, March 18 at 6:30 pm at
Swipely, 10 Dorrance St Providence. Please RSVP either by responding to
this email or on our meetup page at the link below.

http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/events/215041872/

This meeting will feature Larry Cashdollar from Akamai Technologies,
talking about his process and findings in Ruby Gem security.

Larry (@_larry0) Cashdollar is a world-renowned vulnerability researcher,
particularly in the world of Ruby Gems. Larry has disclosed more than 75
vulnerabilities (CVEs) in a variety of open source code. In this talk, he
will show us how he finds the vulnerabilities as well as examples of some
of his recent work. He has been a Unix administrator, was a penetration
tester way back in the late 90's, and he enjoys writing and breaking code.

In other upcoming meetings, we will have Stuart Gorton talking about OSINT
and building a threat intelligence program on April 15. On May 11, we will
be going down to Warwick for that month's meeting only as we will hear
about the state of US Cybersecurity from US Congressman James Langevin. In
June, we will hear about single-sign on mechanisms, with a focus on
Shibboleth from the project chair of Shibboleth, Steven Carmody.

We have a great schedule coming up and don't forget that BSides Boston is
on May 9. Tickets are available for that and the speaker lineup will also
be announced this week! You can see more information on that at
http://www.securitybsides.com/Boston

And to do some cross (and self!) promotion, I will be speaking at OWASP
Boston on Wednesday April 1. The topic is on Impostor Syndrome and how we
deal with it in the infosec field. That meeting will be April 1, 6:30 pm at
Akamai Technologies in Cambridge, MA, 150 Broadway (formerly 8 Cambridge
Center).

That's all for now and we'll see you at Swipely next Wednesday night!
