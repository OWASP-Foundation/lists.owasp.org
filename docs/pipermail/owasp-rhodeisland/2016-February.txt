Hi everybody,

Sorry we've been quiet for a couple months but we've been busy lining up
some great talks for the next few months. We have three currently scheduled
that I think you will get excited about:

Feb 25, How to Talk Security in the Boardroom
Mar 24, Online Security for Kids by a Kid
Apr 7, State of US Cybersecurity with Congressman Jim Langevin

All meetings will be held at Swipely, 10 Dorrance St, Providence. Thank you
Swipely!

So you can see we have a great lineup coming.

First, this month, we have John Strand from Black Hill Information Security
to tell us how to talk to your management about security. When talking with
colleagues, we usually have an understanding of what's important and why
and may not need to explain it as much. But when talking to C-level
management, it might require a different tack, a different way of
explaining things. John will tell us ways that he accomplishes this. John
is located in South Dakota, so this presentation will be live streamed.
Meeting will start at 6:30 pm.

Next, on March 24, we will start a half hour early, at 6 pm, because this
one is for the kids! Please bring your kids to this meeting as we will talk
about how to best protect kids online, things to think about and good
online behavior for kids. Even better, the presentation will be by a kid,
10 year old McKenna. It should be a fun session with great information, and
will start at 6, so we don't keep the kids out too late on a school night.

Finally, on April 7, we will have US Congressman Jim Langevin back to talk
to us again about the state of US cybersecurity. He will tell us what
Congress is doing, what bills are being discussed, what he's working on
with regard to computer and network security, as well as take questions
from the audience. We had a similar meeting with the Congressman last year
and it went extremely well. This meeting will start at 6:30 pm.

All meetings, including the one with Congressman Langevin will be held at
Swipely's headquarters, 10 Dorrance Street in Providence. Swipely also
generously provides pizza and refreshments at each session for us.

That's what we have for now, with even more coming as the spring
approaches. Please RSVP either by responding to this email or at
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

Thank you and see you on February 25th!

OWASP RI Chapter Leader
