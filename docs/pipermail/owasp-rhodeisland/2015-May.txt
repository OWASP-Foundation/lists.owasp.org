Hi all,

Just a reminder that our meeting with Congressman Langevin is tonight, and
it is at his headquarters in Warwick. The seating is limited, so we do
require an RSVP through the Meetup site. If you did RSVP and you cannot
make it, please change your response to "No", as we do have a waitlist.

Details are below, and we'll see you tonight!
