Subject: [Owasp-rhodeisland] OWASP RI - Feb 18 - Digital Forensics
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEBTXWbWAyep-wApMRt3h3-WNtjqAcdVW=9TBCF69dphig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Our next OWASP Rhode Island meeting will be on Wednesday, February 18, 6:30
pm at 10 Dorrance Street, home of Swipely. Our meetings are always free and
open to everyone.

Our topic will be on Digital Forensics and our speaker will be Jacob
Fonseca. Prof. Fay-Wolfe will be unavailable so he generously found Jacob
to come and present for us. About Jacob:
Jacob Fonseca is a digital forensic investigator and security
researcher at the Digital Forensics and Cyber Security Center. He is
an experienced network administrator and is responsible for creating
and maintaining the DFCSC forensic lab and network systems. Mr.
Fonseca specializes in applied computer science for research and
education. He routinely works with state agencies toward improving the
security posture of critical infrastructure in Rhode Island. He earned
his Masters in Computer Science from the University of Rhode Island
and holds several certifications in the areas of investigation and
computer security.

As for upcoming meetings, on March 18, we will have Larry Cashdollar of
Akamai Techologies come and show how he finds Ruby gem vulnerabilities. On
April 15, we will have Stuart Gorton telling us about how to build a threat
intelligence program using OSINT. And finally, in May, it is looking like
we might have a new speaker to announce. I'm finalizing that now but I
think many will be excited to hear from this speaker as well. So many great
things happening.

Lastly, Security BSides in Boston is seeking speakers for their May 9
conference. If you're interested, you can find the information at

Please RSVP for next Wednesday's meeting at either our Meetup.com site (
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/)
or by replying to this email.

Thank you and see you on the 18th!
