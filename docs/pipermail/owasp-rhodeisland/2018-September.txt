Hi All,



Our friends from DevSecCon have kindly offered our community a 20% discount
on their conferences in Boston (10-11 Sep) and in London (18-19 Oct).

They have great keynotes (Chris Wysopal & Adam Shostack in Boston), expert
speakers, industry insights and hands-on workshops - all around making
continuously secure development a reality.



You can check out their conferences here devseccon.com

Hope to see you there.
