	Software Design
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEDS8jZxSW27Pz6GN2hffXdF8pteBSbL4bAa-2q3_=7Tzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all!

I just wanted to let you know that we have our next meeting coming up on
Thursday June 9th at 6:30 pm. This will be at our usual location, Upserve,
10 Dorrance St. in Providence. If you plan to come to this meeting, please
RSVP at
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/events/230208608/
We don't currently have a meeting scheduled for July, so if you have
suggestions or ideas, please send them to me.

Our next meeting is Threat Modeling for Secure Software Design  by Robert
Hurlbut, and here is the description:
Threat modeling is a way of thinking about what could go wrong and how to
prevent it. Instinctively, we all think this way in regards to our own
personal security and safety. When it comes to building software, some
software shops either skip the important step of threat modeling in secure
software design or, they have tried threat modeling before but haven't
quite figured out how to connect the threat models to real world software
development and its priorities. In this session, you will learn practical
strategies in using threat modeling in secure software design and how to
apply risk management in dealing with the threats.

Speaker bio: Robert Hurlbut is an independent software security consultant,
architect, developer, and trainer through Robert Hurlbut Consulting
Services. Robert is a Microsoft MVP for Developer Security and holds the
(ISC)2 CSSLP certification. Robert has over 20+ years of industry
experience in secure coding, software architecture, and software
development and has served at times as a project manager, chief architect,
and director of software development for several clients. Robert blogs at
https://roberthurlbut.com/blog and shares links and other information on
Twitter at @RobertHurlbut

See you all on June 9th!
