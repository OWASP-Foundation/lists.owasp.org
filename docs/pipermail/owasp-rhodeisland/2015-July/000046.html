&gt;<i> Hope you all are enjoying your summer. Our next OWASP RI meeting will be
</I>&gt;<i> on Wednesday, July 29, 6:30 pm at Swipely, 10 Dorrance St, Providence. Our
</I>&gt;<i> speaker will be Ben Brown from Akamai Technologies, presenting &quot;Defending
</I>&gt;<i> Against Doxxing&quot;. Information below, and please RSVP by either replying to
</I>&gt;<i> this email or on our Meetup site. Pizza and drinks are supplied courtesy of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract and Why This Topic is Important: Doxxing is the Internet-based
</I>&gt;<i> practice of researching and broadcasting personally identifiable
</I>&gt;<i> information about an individual. It is also a scourge on our internet lives
</I>&gt;<i> that can quickly boil over into the physical realm. Often wielded as a
</I>&gt;<i> weapon of hate or manipulation and a tactic for intimidation doxxing easily
</I>&gt;<i> leads to real-world threats of violence, financial harm, sexual assault,
</I>&gt;<i> career damage, or even murder. Examples of these impacts can be seen
</I>&gt;<i> surrounding the recent events of 'GamerGate' through the targeting of Anita
</I>&gt;<i> Sarkeesian, Felicia Day, Tara Long, and Brianna Wu. Doxxing also often
</I>&gt;<i> leads to another tragic outcome; that of targets for hate being
</I>&gt;<i> misidentified leading to unaffiliated individuals becoming the subjects of
</I>&gt;<i> attack. Occurrences of this can be found in such online sagas as Anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> vs. Scientology, the Amanda Todd case, and the incorrect fingering of Sunil
</I>&gt;<i> Tripathi as the Boston Bomber. Given the real world impacts of being doxxed
</I>&gt;<i> what can we do to protect ourselves, our friends, and our loved ones? In
</I>&gt;<i> this talk I will highlight common methods employed by doxxers as well as
</I>&gt;<i> methods to safeguard the information they seek. I will move from the easy
</I>&gt;<i> wins and low-hanging fruit, with an eye for practicality, to the more
</I>&gt;<i> complex and long-term defenses employed by professionals. While this is a
</I>&gt;<i> pertinent topic for everyone I believe it is especially important for those
</I>&gt;<i> who's livelihoods involve spending copious amounts of time interacting with
</I>&gt;<i> the internet. Our Doxxing attack surfaces are larger than those for others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bio: Benjamin Brown currently works on systems safety, adversarial
</I>&gt;<i> resilience, and threat intelligence at Akamai Technologies. He has
</I>&gt;<i> experience in the non-profit, academic, and corporate worlds as well as
</I>&gt;<i> degrees in both Anthropology and International Studies. Research interests
</I>&gt;<i> include novel and side-channel attack vectors, radio systems, the
</I>&gt;<i> psychology and anthropology of information security, metacognitive
</I>&gt;<i> techniques, threat actor profiling, intelligence analysis, and thinking
</I>&gt;<i> about security as an ecology of complex systems.
