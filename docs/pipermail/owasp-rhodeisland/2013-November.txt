Subject: [Owasp-rhodeisland] Upcoming OWASP RI Meeting - Hands On! 11/25,
	6 pm
Message-ID: <CAHpuCECP4SWORJsFaiBmf6Pcb5VLmnahAiTCqR-hLZ_jsBG98Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all-

Our next OWASP RI meeting will be on November 25 at 6 pm at Swipely, 39
Peck Street in Providence.

We will have Allison Nixon, fresh off her talk at Black Hat in Las Vegas to
show how to bypass DDoS-protected web sites. If you would like to
participate, please bring the following setup:

Laptop with a WiFi connection, Kali Linux installed with Perl, Wireshark
and ability to run as root. Please also have an email address where you are
able to view the mail headers. Lastly, it would be helpful if you do have
access to your own web server, though this one is not a requirement to
participate.

We're looking forward to seeing you on November 25th and we thank Allison
and Swipely for hosting us and providing refreshments.

Lastly, AppSec USA is next week in New York City. Hopefully I'll see some
of you there!

Just one last reminder that the next OWASP RI meeting will be this coming
Monday night at Swipely in Providence. In the last email, I gave the
incorrect street address. The correct address is 39 Pike Street. The
presentation will begin at 6 pm.

We will have Allison Nixon, fresh off her talk at Black Hat in Las Vegas to
show how to bypass DDoS-protected web sites. If you would like to
participate, please bring the following setup:

Laptop with a WiFi connection, Kali Linux installed with Perl, Wireshark
and ability to run as root. Please also have an email address where you are
able to view the mail headers. Lastly, it would be helpful if you do have
access to your own web server, though this one is not a requirement to
participate.

We're looking forward to seeing you on November 25th and we thank Allison
and Swipely for hosting us and providing refreshments.

Please come on by Monday night, we hope to see you there!
