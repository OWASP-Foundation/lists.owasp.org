Hi all!

On April 15, OWASP RI will have Stuart Gorton in to talk about building a
threat intelligence program using open source intelligence (OSINT). You can
RSVP for this meeting either by responding to this email or at our
meetup.com page here:
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

This meeting will be at 6:30 pm at Swipely, 10 Dorrance Street in
Providence. Pizza and drinks supplied by Swipely as well!

In May, we will be going on a road trip, to Congressman Jim Langevin's
office in Warwick, so he can tell us about the State of US Cybersecurity.
That will be on Monday, May 11.

We had a speaker for June but had to reschedule, so we have an opening
there. If you have a topic you'd like to present, or know someone who
would, come on out!

In other news, tickets are available now for BSides Boston:
www.securitybsides.com/Boston which is on May 9.

And if you're in the Boston area today, I'll be speaking on the topic of
Impostor Syndrome at OWASP Boston tonight at 6:30 pm, 150 Broadway,
Cambridge.

That's all for now, see you on April 15th!

Subject: [Owasp-rhodeisland] OWASP RI: May 11 with Congressman James Langevin
Message-ID: <CAHpuCED=nSo1AUvLSnY2mVz3eDVdnjLwBSdacipF6QwG19RQuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I just wanted to let you all know that our next meeting will be on Monday,
May 11 at 6:30 pm at the headquarters of Congressman James Langevin in
Warwick. The address is 300 Centerville Rd, #200 in Warwick. This is a one
time thing, we will be back at Swipely in Providence for future meetings.

Congressman Langevin is the Chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity
Committee and he will be our guest speaker this month to tell us about the
state of US Cybersecurity. With so many issues in the news, I don't think
we'll have any shortage of conversation!

I have closed the RSVPs as I was told the room has never held more than 30
people and that's where the RSVPs currently are. If you cannot attend,
please change your RSVP so someone else on the waitlist may attend.

We are still finalizing future meetings, as I had interested from one
presenter for June, and I think we are also due for another hackathon going
forward. My thought there is that I may create a VM with Samurai WTF and
Mutillidae/NOWASP on it, go over a couple techniques and then have people
hack away at their own VM instance on their own laptops.

If anyone else would like to present or has ideas for presentations, please
let me know.

Thank you and we'll see you on May 11th!

Patrick
