Subject: [Owasp-rhodeisland] Next OWASP RI Meeting - Monday - 4/15, 6 pm
Message-ID: <CAHpuCECsEkiG2APSh0gjb7kx_9h05nm-WuUOoo9rA6_p088ypw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all, an update and then some other news for you.

First, our next OWASP RI meeting is next week. Monday, April 15th at 6 pm.
Google-able address: 566 South Main St, Providence. It's a brick building
with a billboard on the roof.

Nick MacCarthy will be there to talk about Evolving Web Application
Security - Taking Remediation to the Next Level. It will be presentation
and discussion around some of the things he has found helpful in building
and evolving security programs over the past few years. It will cover
everything around building a program from the low level like scan engine
choice, all the way to the high level needs like senior management buy-in
techniques to establish a sustainable program.

I created a LinkedIn discussion group for interested people to join. This
is where anyone can discuss any related topic. You can join that group
here:

If you'd like to present at an upcoming OWASP RI meeting, we'd love to hear
from you.

Lastly, there will be a Security BSides conference in Providence this
summer, June 14th and 15th. You can get more information/tickets here:

Thanks everyone and we'll see you Monday night!
