Our next OWASP Rhode Island meeting will be Wednesday March 19 at 6:30 pm
at Swipely's new downtown location. 10 Dorrance Street, 9th floor. Again, I
ask that you RSVP by responding to patrick.laverty at owasp.org. This will get
your name on the list at the front desk to go up in the elevators. We're
moving to 6:30 because the Providence parking meters are off starting at 6
pm.

It's by Benjamin Brown from Akamai Technologies. Here's info:

Meta Cognition and Critical Thinking in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) or
It's Turtles All the Way Down Mate

When gathering open source data and transforming it into actionable
intelligence, it is critical to recognize that humans are not objective
observers. Conscious and unconscious assumptions drive analysts' choices
about which data to analyze and how much importance to ascribe to each
resource. Furthermore, analysts' personal conceptual frameworks about
reality and how the world works can undermine the process of objectively
translating data into intelligence. These implicit assumptions, otherwise
known as cognitive biases, can lead to missed data, skewed intelligence,
illogical conclusions, and poor decision making. In this presentation I
will illustrate cognitive biases relevant to OSINT and what can be done
about them.

Speaker bio: Benjamin Brown currently works on systems safety, adversarial
resilience, and threat intelligence at Akamai Technologies. He has
experience in Non-profit, Academia, and the corporate world as well as
degrees in both Anthropology and International Studies. Research interests
include the psychology, anthropology, and sociology of information
security, threat actor profiling, and thinking about security as an ecology
of complex systems.


Ben is a great speaker and expert on Open Source Intelligence and critical
thinking. Also, this meeting is sponsored by Swipely who generously
provides the meeting space as well as refreshments.

In April we'll have a presentation on the OWASP Broken Web Apps (BWA)
project and in May, we'll hear about automating XSS testing. And please
don't forget to RSVP to patrick.laverty at owasp.org.


Thank you and see you on the 19th!
