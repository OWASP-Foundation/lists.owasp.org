Subject: [Owasp-rhodeisland] Next OWASP RI Meeting
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEAyFgf-jyXcHjK3bOmyYBVKk13n8gC-CM8c3UTY6TBENA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all-

If you subscribed to the provwebappsec.com mailing list, I've taken the
liberty of subscribing you to the official OWASP-Rhode Island listserv.
This will be the only list used for meeting notifications, and that will be
the only purpose of the list. If you'd like to unsubscribe, you can do that
here: https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-rhodeisland

Ok, now for the news. Two things, really quick:

The next meeting will be on Monday, March 4, 5:45 pm at Swipely in
Providence. Location information and a map is here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Rhode_Island#Next_Meeting but the quick
directions is it's right off Wickenden, across from Al Forno.

The topic of our meeting will be some more hands-on hacking. We'll go over
a couple favorite topics like SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting and
try it against a vulnerable server, and we'll see how to guard against
these. We'll have a little fun with it and try making it a non-competitive
(read: educational) capture the flag game.

The only other thing is there will be a Security BSides conference in
Providence this summer. If you're interested in attending, it's only $20
admission. The full presenters list is available at
http://securitybsides.com/BSidesRI

That's it for now, we'll see you on March 4 at Swipely!

Thank you.

Patrick

Subject: [Owasp-rhodeisland] OWASP-RI - Hands on Hacking is Back!
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEC0iHiPY_exmLQ9BYQ2a5SPKq-QDXTEz5Chzvc6sJfRUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Monday, March 4, 6 pm, we'll do another round of Hands on Hacking! We'll go
over topics like SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS), what they
are, what can be done with them and of course, ways to prevent these in
your applications.

First and foremost, this is intended to be educational for developers.
We're not training the "black hats". We want developers to be aware of what
can happen and use OWASP's own suggested techniques for more secure code.
Please bring your laptop that has the ability to connect wirelessly in
order to participate in the hands-on portion. (or you might get kinda bored)

Additionally, I believe the best way to learn things is in three steps:
Learn It, Do It, Teach It. I'm going to be doing the presenting using this
and this is me on the third step. Please bring your expectations
accordingly. I'm no world-renowned rock-star expert on this stuff. I'm
willing to share what I know and would like to make this interactive and
collaborative with you. If you know something that others don't, please
share it.

This meeting is this coming Monday night, 6 pm at Swipely's headquarters.
Use 566 South Main Street, Providence as the address to find it in Google
maps. It's between Al Forno and the Shell gas station in the brick building
with the billboard on its roof. Swipely is generously providing
refreshments as well.

We don't currently have a presenter for next month, so if you have
something you'd like to talk about, please let me know.

If you don't want to receive these notifications in the future, you can
either email me and I'll remove you or your can remove yourself here:
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-rhodeisland (or forward that
link to others who *want* to be notified)

As always, OWASP RI meetings are open to anyone and free for everyone.
Please bring friends and colleagues, the more the merrier!

Any questions, comments, thoughts or even just ramblings, please send those
on over, and we'll see you Monday night!

Thank you.

Patrick
