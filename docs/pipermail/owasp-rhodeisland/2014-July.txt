We're getting to that time again! Our next OWASP RI meeting will be in two
weeks, but first, I have some other exciting news. If you missed last
month's meeting, it was recorded and is available on YouTube at the OWASP
RI channel. I will plan to put more meetings up there as I can.

Also, in video news AppSecEurope just happened and all their talks are
available at their channel:

But most exciting is this month's talk from Milandon Foley on Point of Sale
(POS) Malware. Here's his description of the talk:
This is a Point of Sale Malware presentation focusing on breaches in the
industry. This presentation uses the Target breach as an example, and
cautions against following in Target?s footsteps, as well as outlining as a
whole POS Malware and infection vectors most commonly experienced.

This meeting will be at Swipely, 10 Dorrance St, 9th Floor, Wednesday, July
16th at 6:30 pm. Please RSVP (or use the meetup link below) to expedite
getting up the elevators past the security desk.

We will have our August meeting scheduled shortly and will get back to you
with that information.

Thank you and we'll see you on the 16th!
