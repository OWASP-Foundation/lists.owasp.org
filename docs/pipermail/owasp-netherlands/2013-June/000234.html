Program:

17:45 - 18:15: Registration &amp; Sandwiches

 

18:15 - 18:30: Intro and OWASP Updates

 

18:30 - 19:15:: &quot;The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)&quot; - Simon Benetts

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience
and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to
penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an experienced pen
testers toolbox.

It is also community project, being maintained by a worldwide group of
volunteers and is completely free, open source and cross platform. Since its
release in 2010 ZAP has gone from strength to strength and is now a flagship
OWASP project.

19:15 - 19:30: Break

 

19:30 - 20:15: &quot;Needles in haystacks, we we are not solving the appsec
problem &amp; html hacking the browser, CSP is dead.&quot; - Eoin Keary

&quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different
results.&quot; - Albert Einstein

We continue to rely on a &quot;pentest&quot; to secure our applications. Why do we
think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application to
help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100 times
longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability? Our testing
methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the tools
they use. Currently we treat vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLI as different
issues but the root causes it the same. - it's all code injection theory!!
Why do we do this and make security bugs over complex?

Why are we still happy with &quot;Testing security out&quot; rather than the more
superior &quot;building security in&quot;?

20:15 - 21:00 &quot;Secure Coding, some simple steps help&quot; - Steven van der Baan

Secure coding is often perceived as difficult and complex.

While it is true that 'good security' should be embedded into the design,
there are a couple of steps a developer can take which lead to a more secure
application. In this presentation we will go to the basics of secure
application development and demonstrate these principles which help you
build security into your application. - Secure Coding, some simple steps
help

21:00 - 21:30 Networking
