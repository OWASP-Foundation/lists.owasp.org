<PRE> Free OWASP European Tour event at the OWASP Netherlands Chapter!

*Registration via*:

<A HREF="http://owaspdutchchaptermeeting20062013.eventbrite.nl/#">http://owaspdutchchaptermeeting20062013.eventbrite.nl/#</A>

*Program:*
17:45 - 18:15: Registration &amp; Sandwiches

18:15 - 18:30: Intro and OWASP Updates

18:30 - 19:15:: &#8220;The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)&#8221; &#8211; Simon Benetts

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security
experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who
are new to penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an
experienced pen testers toolbox.
It is also community project, being maintained by a worldwide group of
volunteers and is completely free, open source and cross platform. Since
its release in 2010 ZAP has gone from strength to strength and is now a
flagship OWASP project.

19:15 - 19:30: Break

19:30 - 20:15: &#8220;Needles in haystacks, we we are not solving the appsec
problem &amp; html hacking the browser, CSP is dead.&#8221; &#8211; Eoin Keary

&quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different
results.&quot; - Albert Einstein
We continue to rely on a &#8220;pentest&#8221; to secure our applications. Why do we
think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application to
help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100 times
longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability? Our testing
methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the tools
they use. Currently we treat vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLI as different
issues but the root causes it the same. &#8211; it&#8217;s all code injection theory!!
Why do we do this and make security bugs over complex?
Why are we still happy with &#8220;Testing security out&#8221; rather than the more
superior &#8220;building security in&#8221;?

20:15 - 21:00 &#8220;Secure Coding, some simple steps help&#8221; - Steven van der Baan

Secure coding is often perceived as difficult and complex.
While it is true that 'good security' should be embedded into the design,
there are a couple of steps a developer can take which lead to a more
secure application. In this presentation we will go to the basics of secure
application development and demonstrate these principles which help you
build security into your application. - Secure Coding, some simple steps
help

21:00 - 21:30 Networking
