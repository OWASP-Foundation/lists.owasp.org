security. An example of this is the famous OWASP top ten of most critical

Buffer Overflows on .Net and Asp.Net
One of the common myths about the .Net Framework is that it is immune to
Buffer Overflows. Although this might be correct in pure managed and
verifiable .Net code, large percentage of .Net and Asp.Net applications code
is unmanaged code. In this talk Dinis will show the areas in .Net and
Asp.Net applications that are vulnerable to Buffer Overflows (including the
demo of a .Net Buffer Overflow Fuzzer). 

ABOUT THE PRESENTERS

Ivan Ristic is the creator of  <http://www.modsecurity.org/> ModSecurity (an
open source web application firewall and intrusion detection/prevention
engine). Ivan also wrote Apache Security for O'Reilly, a web security guide
for administrators, system architects, and programmers. For more info, see
Anurag Agarwal's
<http://myappsecurity.blogspot.com/2007/03/reflection-on-ivan-ristic.html>
reflection on Ivan Ristic.

Dinis Cruz is a renowned application security expert who is passionate about
training developers to move beyond the `comfort zone' of standard ASP.NET
development and into the world of advanced security aware development with
the aim of making the Web Applications as secure as possible against malware
and malicious hackers. Dinis is also the project leader for the OWASP .Net
Project and the and the main developer of several of OWASP .Net tools
(SAM'SHE, ANBS, SiteGenerator, PenTest Reporter, ASP.Net Reflector, Online
