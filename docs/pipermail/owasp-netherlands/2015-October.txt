Dear OWASP Netherlands follower,

Pizzas and beverages are sponsored by Fontys Hogeschool ICT, Eindhoven.
OAuth (and more)

OAuth is a new kind of security protocol. It's used for delegating various
features from one service to another on behalf of your users. OAuth
intersects with authentication and access control, let would not likely use
OAuth in and of itself for authentication, session management or an access
control in your applications. Even more confusing, OAuth is not in an of
itself a standard and various service providers will likely have different
implementations. Let's say it again, OAuth is not a standard - its a
framework for delegation. So this leaves us with questions! What really is
delegation? Where does OAuth fit in? How can I use OAuth in a secure
fashion? These questions and more will me answered in this talk!
