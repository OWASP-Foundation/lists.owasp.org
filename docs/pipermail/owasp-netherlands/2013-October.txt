Hi all,

OWASP Netherlands Chapter Meeting, October 31st!

*Where: *SURFnet - Radboudkwartier 273, 3511 CK Utrecht
*Registration via:*
http://owaspnetherlandschaptermeetingoctober312013.eventbrite.nl/

See OWASP Netherlands at: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Netherlands

*Agenda:*
*18:30 - 19:15:* Registration & Pizza
*19:15 ? 20:00:* *?Third Party Java Libraries for Secure Development? - Jim
Manico *
Do not build your own web application security controls from scratch! This
presentation describes
the use of several OWASP, Apache and Google open source Java projects that
are essential tools to help you construct a secure web applications.
*20:00 - 20:15: Break *
*20:15 - 21:00:* ?*From the Trenches: Real-World Agile SDLC? - Chris Eng &
Ryan O?Boyle *
Ideally, all organizations would incorporate security into their Agile
development processes;
however, best-practices Agile SDL models typically assume a simplified,
idealized model of how
software is built. These models also impose impractical requirements
without providing the
necessary support or expertise. In reality, software development often
involves multiple Agile teams working on various components of a larger
product, and only the most well-resourced enterprises or ISVs have the
bandwidth to execute on the ideal Agile SDL, while smaller organizations
are forced to adapt and make tradeoffs. In this session, we?ll discuss how
Veracode has incorporated security into our own Agile development lifecycle
for a product that involves anywhere from two to seven Scrum teams working
in concert to ship monthly releases. We do this without designating any
security experts full-time to the project. We?ll explain how we?ve evolved
our practices to optimize the way our security research team interacts with
our engineering teams and accommodates their processes. We?ll also talk
about
some of the lessons we?ve learned along the way, including things that
haven?t worked or wouldn?t scale, and how other organizations can use our
experience to integrate security practices into their own Agile development
programs.
*21:00 - 21:30 Networking *

*About the speakers: *
*Jim Manico* is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a
web and application security firm. He authors and delivers developer

outlets worldwide. Throughout his career at
