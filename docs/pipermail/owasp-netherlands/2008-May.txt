Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] Call for speakers
Message-ID: <48204897.5070905@irc2.nl>

Hello OWASP list members,

This year, the OWASP NL chapter wants to have a meeting that will be valuable not only for developers, testers and software 
architects, but for (project) managers, security officers and various other decision makers too. With the whole software 
development life cycle as scope.

The upcoming meeting is planned for Thursday June 12th and we decided that this meeting will be as such.

We have a speaker slot of 40 minutes free and are looking for speakers. Topics may vary, but we are particularly interested in:

Business Case(!)
Security measures in software development life cycle
Organization of security
Compliance
Risk analysis

The presentations should not focus on awareness too much, but give useful and practical information. If you are willing to 
give a presentation or have names of people we should contact, please contact us!

Thank you!

Bert Koelewijn
OWASP Netherlands chapter team
