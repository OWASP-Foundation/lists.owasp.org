<PRE>You're welcome to the second meeting of the OWASP Netherlands local chapter!

In this second meeting focus groups are to be formed, to discuss common problems, develop and research common solutions in a vendor neutral
environment. So this is a very good opportunity to get in contact with others, to exchange knowledge and experiences on specific topics.

For every focus group the following questions has to be answered:
1. Which specific topic is to be addressed?
2. What are the deliverables?
3. What is the relation to OWASP? (Current projects, materials, expertise and knowledge interchange, etc.)
4. Who is the central contact of the subgroup?

It would be nice to have a bigger and more diverse group, compared to the first meeting. So let's recall: &quot;Please, bring at least one friend, next
time.&quot; And don't hesitate to sent this announcement to everybody who may be interested!

We thank Getronics PinkRoccade for offering us a venue:
Getronics PinkRoccade
Fauststraat 1
7323 BA Apeldoorn

The agenda:
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In (bread &amp; drinks)
18.30 - 18.45 Opening
18.45 - 19.30 Improving Security in the Application Development Life-cycle, Migchiel de Jong
19.30 - 20.00 Collecting focus group initiatives
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break
20.00 - 21.00 Form focus groups

Presentation Abstract
Rather than spending large amounts of time and money on proving that we have security vulnerabilities after programs go into production, companies
should go to the source and correct vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development stage. It is unquestionably faster, simpler, and cheaper
for developers to correct vulnerabilities as they build programs.
But how can development management ensure that developers focus on security when there is no time or budget for security at the development stage?
Even with the correct focus, how can they learn what to look for? How can they stay ahead of the dedicated and resourceful hacker?
The answer is effective processes and better tools. With advanced software security tools, a developer can pinpoint vulnerabilities in a matter of
seconds &#8212; the same vulnerabilities that would take a hacker or manual code reviewer weeks or even months to find.
These same tools can give development and information security managers useful metrics on application vulnerabilities before they are released into
deployment.
This talk will walk through the Application Development Life-Cycle and discuss how tools can help come to grips with software security issues in a
particular phase.

About the presenter
Migchiel de Jong has developed hardware and software for 10 years before joining Rational Software. During the 5 years at Rational Software (later
acquired by IBM) he was involved in many software development process improvement projects. Currently Migchiel de Jong is working at Fortify Software,
Palo Alto, California, as a software security engineer.

If you want to attend send an email to <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-netherlands">owasp at irc2.nl.</A> Please don't wait, 9 march is not that long anymore!

All OWASP chapter meetings are free, there are never vendor pitches or sales presentations at OWASP meetings.

NOTE TO CISSP&#8217;s: OWASP Meetings count towards CPE Credits.

Best Regards,

Bert Koelewijn
