<PRE>On 9 march, the second meeting of OWASP Netherlands local chapter took place. GetronicsPinkRoccade provided the venue, in their luxury conference 
centre: Connection I.

Agenda:
18.00 - 18.45 Check-In (bread &amp; drinks)
18.45 - 19.00 Opening
19.00 - 20.00 Improving Security in the Application Development Life-cycle, Migchiel de Jong
20.00 - 20.15 Coffee break
20.15 - 22.00 Form focus groups

The presentation of Migchiel de Jong was found very interesting by the audience. At the end of his presentation, he demonstrated a static code 
analysis of the OWASP webgoat application.

After the coffee break, the attendances started discussing about the largest common topics of interest in the web application security field, in 
relation to the OWASP Netherlands chapter. As a result, the following focus groups are formed:

Testing
The current OWASP Testing project and the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual of ISECOM, provide guidelines and best practices for 
testers. These guidelines can be used to formalize a standard structure and a set of minimum requirements for a security test. Clients could ask a 
tester to adhere to these guidelines.
A second idea is to standardize the testing results management report. In practice, testing could result in piles of paper with all the findings. The 
real value is reporting it in a usable way. For example: mapping technical findings to business risks.

First focus group meeting: Monday 27 march, 18:00h, PwC Utrecht


Public Relations
This focus group will try to make business aware of the security impact that developing, hosting and using web applications has. What OWASP is and how 
OWASP can help. This can be done by giving presentations, writing papers and articles, word of mouth, etc. etc.

First presentation of OWASP materials: Edwin van Vliet, TestNet - Voorjaarsevenement, 5 april
First focus group meeting: To be planned!


Education
OWASP and universities/schools could benefit from working together. For example:
- OWASP provides lot's of materials usable in colleges.
- Develop OWASP training course.
- Students can participate in OWASP projects
- OWASP can provide a platform for supporting research. Such as thesis projects, etc.
- OWASP representatives could provide guest colleges.
