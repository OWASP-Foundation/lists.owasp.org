Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] [Owasp-world] Welcome to OWASP
Message-ID: <020f01c5df23$b7ea1d30$4301a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Hello everyone,

 

You're receiving this message because you are subscribed to one or more Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP) mailing lists (http://www.owasp.org
<http://www.owasp.org/> ). OWASP-WORLD is a low-volume mailing list reserved
for important events and announcements of interest to everyone in the OWASP
community.

  
1) Basic Philosophy: OWASP's mission is to find and fight the causes of
application vulnerabilities. These span organizational issues, people
issues, process issues, and technology issues. OWASP encourages the informed
use of application security technologies while being critical of excessive
vendor claims.  Note that OWASP does not focus on network or infrastructure
security issues, as the application layer has its own unique issues,
techniques, and technologies.



2) History: OWASP is an open source project started in 2000. The OWASP
Foundation was established as a 501c3 not-for-profit in 2003 and currently
we have thousands of participants around the world.  Our website receives
millions of hits every month and our work (tools and documentation) is used
by many corporations and agencies around the world.  We also have over 50
local chapters working to spread knowledge of application security.  Please
take a minute to explore the website to see the projects and chapters there.
 
3) Organization: OWASP does all of its work in the open, and everything is
available under one of the open source licenses. We operate on a shoestring
budget and rely on dedicated individuals for just about everything. We've
recently started a membership program so that organizations that benefit
from the work done by the OWASP community can support our mission.



You may be interested in the presentations from the most recent OWASP
conference at NIST.  They are available on the OWASP website at
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc/schedule.html.  All of the
presentations were videotaped and will be made available for viewing online
soon.

 

Thank you all for your support of OWASP.

 

--Jeff

Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] OWASP Netherlands kick-off meeting minutes
Message-ID: <43858AE2.90901@ascure.com>

Hello all,

On 17 November, OWASP Netherlands had it's first meeting. We moved to a bigger location, the Mercure hotel in Nieuwegein, to host all the 35 attendees.

The agenda:
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In (bread & drinks)

18.30 - 18.45 Chapter opening

18.45 - 19.30 Presentation - 'Top tien web applicatie kwetsbaarheden in J2EE', Eelco Klaver

19.30 - 19.45 Presentation - 'Veilige webapplicaties boven alles', Mike Wardi

19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break

20.00 - 21.00 Discussion - About the OWASP Netherlands local chapter

The discussion took place in a 'round table' session, where all attendees were able to take part. The focus of the discussion was how to give the
OWASP Netherlands local chapter additional value, next to the OWASP project. What the goals and tasks will be. And which actions will have to be taken
at short term.

Different people have interest in different subjects. In general meetings there is no time to address all subjects and address them specific enough.
Therefore subgroups can be formed, focusing on specific topics. They can have their own communication channel and meetings, but should keep close
contact with the OWASP body.

An inventarisation:

Discussion Topics
- Awareness: writing articles, press publications, interviews
- Education: contact universities, schools and their common boards. Develop and gather education materials.
- General: discuss ideas for OWASP NL

Focusgroup Topics
- (dutch) metrics project
- (dutch) legal project
- standard framework for pentest reports
- safe outsourcing

Actions that should be taken on short term are:
- provide communication channels
- plan next (sub)meetings
- start discussions and focusgroups

All presentations will be available for download.

Best Regards,

Bert Koelewijn

Message-ID: <438AC5AE.5010807@ascure.com>

Goodmorning!

To support discussions of local subgroups, it would be nice to have separate communication channels, such as web forums. The current status is, that 
there is an infrastructure to support this, but I'm still in discussion with OWASP.

In the meanwhile I'll start the discussions with separate threads on the mailing list.

Bert Koelewijn

Dear all,

Till now Bert Koelewijn, choosed English as language for the mailinglist communication. As I couldn't find a definition of the language and the language at the kick-off was in Dutch I would like to propose the Dutch language.
If there is anyone subscribed to this mailinglist who preferres English please let us know, else let's choose for Dutch.

Dear Geert,

English is the preferred language on the mailing list. There are a
couple of reasons for this:

- archive function of the mailing list
The mailing list serves as an information archive, for the whole OWASP
community

- participation of OWASP chapters, companies and other individuals
outside the Netherlands
Participation on discussions, projects, development, etc. etc.

- companies grow outside national borders, employees frequently speak
English

But if somebody has difficulties writing in English, please write in
Dutch, instead of not writing at all!

Regards,

Bert Koelewijn

Geert en Peter,
Kunnen jullie aangeven wat de correspondentie taal is van andere OWASP mail lijsten, waarvan de moedertaal 
eveneens niet engels is?
Ik denk dat wij ons moeten conformeren aan de reeds bestaande OWASP afdelingen.
Persoonlijk verwacht ik dat het vakgebied dermate van niveau is, dat iedereen redelijk tot goed de engelse taal 
beheerst.
