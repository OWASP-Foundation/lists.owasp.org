Dear Benelux members,

I wanted to inform everyone that the schedule of BruCON 2010 is online. A
small non-profit community-driven security conference in Brussels featuring
various topics including application security. While there are no specific
discount codes, normal tickets are only 150 euro.

Participants are welcome to contribute their own topics to the conference
and you can still register for a lightning talk. Only rule is:
non-commercial, ethical and legal topics only. ;-)

Title:
======
Advanced SQL Injection

Program Summary:
================
SQL Injection is a vulnerability that is often missed by web application
security scanners, and it's a vulnerability that is often rated as NOT
exploitable by security testers when it actually can be exploited.

Advanced SQL Injection is a presentation geared toward showing
security professionals advanced exploitation techniques for situations
when you must prove to the customer the extent of compromise that is
possible.

The key areas are:

       * Re-Enabling stored procedures
       * Old and new ways of obtaining an interactive command-shell
       * Data Exfiltration via DNS
       * IDS Evasion & Web Application Firewall Bypass
       * Privilege Escalation



Bio:
=======
Joe McCray has 10 years of experience in the security industry with a
diverse background that includes network and web application penetration
testing, forensics, training, and regulatory compliance. Joe is a
frequent presenter at security conferences, and has taught Ethical
Hackng and Web Application Security at Johns Hopkins University (JHU),
University of Maryland Baltimore College (UMBC), and several other
technical training centers across the country.

Workshop Google Hacks & Skipfish (June 30th 2010) PROGRAM
*18:00 - 18:30 Check-In (catering included)*
*18:30 - 18:45 Opening(OWASP organization, projects, sponsor)*
*19:00 - 21:00 Workshop Google Hacking & Skipfish* Bios:
Christian Heinrich is the Project Leader of the OWASP "Google Hacking"
Project i.e. "Download Indexed Cache" and has contributed to the
"Spiders/Robots/Crawlers" and "Search Engine Reconnaissance" sections of the
OWASP Testing Guide v3 and more recently to the development of the OWASP Top
Ten and Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) OWASP Projects. He
has presented at OWASP Conferences in USA, Australia and Europe and OWASP
Chapters in London, UK and Sydney and Melbourne, Australia.
*Google Hacking:*
Google Hacks is a compilation of carefully crafted Google searches that
expose novel functionality from Google's search and map services. For
example, you can use it to view a timeline of your search results, view a
map, search for music, search for books, and perform many other specific
kinds of searches. You can also use this program to use google as a proxy.
*Skipfish:*
A fully automated, active web application security reconnaissance tool.
Key features:
High speed: pure C code, highly optimized HTTP handling, minimal CPU
footprint - easily achieving 2000 requests per second with responsive
targets. Ease of use: heuristics to support a variety of quirky web
frameworks and mixed-technology sites, with automatic learning capabilities,
on-the-fly wordlist creation, and form autocompletion. Cutting-edge security
logic: high quality, low false positive, differential security checks,
capable of spotting a range of subtle flaws, including blind injection
vectors.
