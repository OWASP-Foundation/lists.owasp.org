Dear OWASP Netherlands follower,

It is two weeks ago, we hosted the very successful OWAS AppSec-Eu/Research
2015 conference.
We are striving in improving the OWASP Netherlands meetings and
organisation. If you want to participate in the local OWASP Netherlands
Chapter, we are looking forward to see you June 25th in the Stairways,
Utrecht.

See for more information:

With kind regards,
-martin
