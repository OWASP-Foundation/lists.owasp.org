*Presentations:*
OWASP AppSec-Eu/Research May 19th to 22nd 2015 - Martin Knobloch

Preview of the AppSec-Eu/Research conference, May 19th to 22nd.
Applying static analysis:
Where architectural analysis finds flaws (design) in the application,
static analysis is an excellent way of weeding out the bugs
(implementation). However, static analysis is neither trivial from a
theoretical nor from a practical perspective. In this session, we will
discuss the theory behind static analysis as well as how to tune static
analysis in such way that the solution becomes an excellent way to weed out
security bugs in your organization.

*Speakers:*
Daan Raman

Daan Raman works at NVISO, where he is responsible for R&amp;D. His core
activities consist of technical research with a current focus on
application security for mobile systems. Using the results obtained during
the team's R&amp;D activities, Daan also ensures the software security
assessments at NVISO are executed according to the last known attack
methods and vectors.

Outside of his professional activities, Daan has been an active member of
the technical security community for several year, attending and presenting
at conferences, as well as developing software.
Matias Madou

Matias has over a decade of hands-on software security experience. From the
research to improve existing solutions to scoping and providing the vision
for new solutions. A dozen patents and a bunch of papers are the result of
the fundamental research that eventually led to a hand full of commercial
products.
