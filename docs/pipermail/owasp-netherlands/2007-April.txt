Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <461CB0BA.9070600@irc2.nl>

Hello all,

here's a sign of life from the OWASP front! As you maybe expected, the planned OWASP meeting for tomorrow (12 april) is not 
going to take place. Because of personal priorities (my newborn daughter), I haven't had the time to gather an evening full 
of interesting events.

The new date for the OWASP meeting is Thursday 3 May. And the topic is: .NET Security Best Practices. Very specifically 
targeted at .NET architects, developers and security testers.

Initiatives for an expert presentation/demo/workshop/etc. are more than welcome!

Best Regards,

Hello all,

For the upcoming OWASP chapter meeting we have the following speakers until now. The date for the upcoming meeting is again 
problematic, because I could not manage to get a third speaker. Therefore I want to do a call for a .NET security specialist 
that would like to organize a .NET demo/workshop for the upcoming OWASP meeting. The evening should have a real added value 
for .NET developers and architects!

Sebastien is the OWASP local chapter leader of the Belgium chapter and has recently started the OWASP Education Project:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project

The Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be 
combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences. He will introduce the Education Project and show us the 
value of information and awareness that is specifically targeted at the various audiences. And of course hopes to get some 
people to volunteer for contributing to the project.

Hopefully we will meet very soon!
