Hi all,

I'm very happy with this list. I'll try and plan a sub-meeting early March on the topic of Secure Outsourcing and Security in Standard Software. Target as far as I'm concerned to get the focus clear and an approach for one or both topics.

Is Haarlemmerweg Amsterdam a suitable location for those interested? Please let us know if you're (still) interested.

Kind regards,

Geert,
 
I think #5 can be one of the solutions for #2, so it makes sense to combine the two issues. By applying metrics it is possible to evaluate a software product with respect to security.

Dear Peter, Geert, all,

Thanks for sending the list. I would also like to join the focus group on 
the standard framework for pentesting. 

I would be happy to provide the venue for the first meeting of such a 
focus group, in Utrecht or Amsterdam, whichever turns
out to be most convenient. 

I would suggest that we wait to plan this group until there are some more 
participants. Geert's list only mentions Peter, adding myself to that 
makes 2, which is not really a focus group. Are there any more people 
interested in this subject?

Met vriendelijke groet / kind regards,

Hello all,

I am sorry to say that Bert has been ill and in hospital for the last few days.
He has a high fever, but seems to be recovering.

If there is any more news regarding Bert, I will let you know.
As far as I know the proposed chaptermeeting will continue on the
proposed day, but if I have more news on that, I will let the list
know as soon as I can.

Hi chapter,

Interesting subjects. To me, most interesting are:
1. Standard framework for pentesting
2. Safe outsourcing/Security in standard software

Please add me to these focus groups. I am looking forward to the March 9th
meeting. If I can assist with anything in the organization, please let me
know.

Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] March Meeting
Message-ID: <43FB8819.6090102@irc2.nl>

Hello All,

A very high fever caught me, just when I returned from a nice and pleasant vacation. But I'm up and running again! The H5N1 tests were negative ;=)

The meeting 9 march is definitive.

When reading all the subgroup initiatives, I think we should reserve time for forming the subgroups on the general meeting.
For every subgroup the following questions has to be answered:
1. Which specific topic is to be addressed?
2. What are the deliverables?
3. What is the relation to OWASP? (Current projects, materials, expertise and knowledge interchange, etc.)
4. Who is the central contact of the subgroup?

Currently we are looking for a venue somewhere around Utrecht and 1 speaker.

It would be nice to have a bigger and more diverse group, compared to the first meeting. So let's recall: "Please, bring at least one friend, next time."

The agenda:
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In (bread & drinks)
18.30 - 18.45 Opening
18.45 - 19.30 Presentation
19.30 - 20.00 Inventarisation of subgroup initiatives
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break
20.00 - 21.00 Form subgroups

If you want to attend, please send an email to owasp at irc2.nl

All OWASP chapter meetings are free! There are never vendor pitches or sales presentations at OWASP meetings.

NOTE TO CISSP?s: OWASP Meetings count towards CPE Credits.

Best Regards,

Bert Koelewijn

Hello Eelco, all,

Actually, the questions asked when outsourcing software are:

- How safe is my software?
- How does the software developer respond to security incidents?
- etc.

To really know something about the security of a software product, we have to evaluate the full development cycle and the product itself. This has a 
big overlap with SSE-CMM (ISO/IEC 21827) and the metrics project, as Eelco stated earlier.

Maybe we could combine 'safe outsourcing', 'metrics' and a 'capability maturity model' into one project? Something like:

- Guideline for developing software with verifiable security objectives
or
- Security Maturity Level of the development life cycle (-> CMMI extension?)

Please let me know your thoughts...

Best Regards,

Bert

Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] Interesting book
Message-ID: <44029D27.30001@irc2.nl>

Hello all,

This book deals with a lot of topics, recently discussed on this list.

http://www.awprofessional.com/title/0321356705

Software Security is about putting the touchpoints to work for you. Because you can apply these touchpoints to the software artifacts you already 
produce as you develop software, you can adopt this book's methods without radically changing the way you work. Inside you'll find detailed 
explanations of

* Risk management frameworks and processes
* Code review using static analysis tools
* Architectural risk analysis
* Penetration testing
* Security testing
* Abuse case development

Could be interesting for some people here...

If you have good book recommendations, please share them with us!

Cheers,

Bert

Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] OWASP Meeting 9 March
Message-ID: <4404352F.8070906@irc2.nl>

You're welcome to the second meeting of the OWASP Netherlands local chapter!

In this second meeting focus groups are to be formed, to discuss common problems, develop and research common solutions in a vendor neutral
environment. So this is a very good opportunity to get in contact with others, to exchange knowledge and experiences on specific topics.

For every focus group the following questions has to be answered:
1. Which specific topic is to be addressed?
2. What are the deliverables?
3. What is the relation to OWASP? (Current projects, materials, expertise and knowledge interchange, etc.)
4. Who is the central contact of the subgroup?

It would be nice to have a bigger and more diverse group, compared to the first meeting. So let's recall: "Please, bring at least one friend, next
time." And don't hesitate to sent this announcement to everybody who may be interested!

Location:
Will be announced soon. But still, venue offerings are most welcome.

The agenda:
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In
18.30 - 18.45 Opening
18.45 - 19.30 Improving Security in the Application Development Life-cycle, Migchiel de Jong
19.30 - 20.00 Collecting focus group initiatives
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break
20.00 - 21.00 Form focus groups

Presentation Abstract
Rather than spending large amounts of time and money on proving that we have security vulnerabilities after programs go into production, companies
should go to the source and correct vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development stage. It is unquestionably faster, simpler, and cheaper
for developers to correct vulnerabilities as they build programs.
But how can development management ensure that developers focus on security when there is no time or budget for security at the development stage?
Even with the correct focus, how can they learn what to look for? How can they stay ahead of the dedicated and resourceful hacker?
The answer is effective processes and better tools. With advanced software security tools, a developer can pinpoint vulnerabilities in a matter of
seconds ? the same vulnerabilities that would take a hacker or manual code reviewer weeks or even months to find.
These same tools can give development and information security managers useful metrics on application vulnerabilities before they are released into
deployment.
This talk will walk through the Application Development Life-Cycle and discuss how tools can help come to grips with software security issues in a 
particular phase.

About the presenter
Migchiel de Jong has developed hardware and software for 10 years before joining Rational Software. During the 5 years at Rational Software (later
acquired by IBM) he was involved in many software development process improvement projects. Currently Migchiel de Jong is working at Fortify Software,
Palo Alto, California, as a software security engineer.

If you want to attend send an email to owasp at irc2.nl. Please don't wait, 9 march is not that long anymore!

All OWASP chapter meetings are free, there are never vendor pitches or sales presentations at OWASP meetings.

NOTE TO CISSP?s: OWASP Meetings count towards CPE Credits.

Best Regards,

Bert Koelewijn
