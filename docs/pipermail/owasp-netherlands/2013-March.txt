Hi OWASP Netherlands Members,

We are looking for two volunteers to man the OWASP Info booth at the
BlackHat this week Thursday and Friday, March 14th and 15th!

What we expect:
- We look for volunteers who can actively promote the OWASP mission!
- be at the stand for the majority of the conference day

What is in for you:
- one day at the booth and one day free at the conference
  (you will be able to visit some talks during the booth day)

What you cannot do:
As you will be representing the OWASP Foundation and the OWASP Netherlands
chapter, you cannot promote you company or your companies services!
First to come is first to serve!

Cheers,
--
