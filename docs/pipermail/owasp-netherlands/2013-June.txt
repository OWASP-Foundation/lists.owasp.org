17:45 - 18:15: Registration & Sandwiches

18:15 - 18:30: Intro and OWASP Updates

18:30 - 19:15:: ?The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)? ? Simon Benetts

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security
experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who
are new to penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an
experienced pen testers toolbox.
It is also community project, being maintained by a worldwide group of
volunteers and is completely free, open source and cross platform. Since
its release in 2010 ZAP has gone from strength to strength and is now a
flagship OWASP project.

19:15 - 19:30: Break

19:30 - 20:15: ?Needles in haystacks, we we are not solving the appsec
problem & html hacking the browser, CSP is dead.? ? Eoin Keary

"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different
results." - Albert Einstein
We continue to rely on a ?pentest? to secure our applications. Why do we
think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application to
help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100 times
longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability? Our testing
methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the tools
they use. Currently we treat vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLI as different
issues but the root causes it the same. ? it?s all code injection theory!!
Why do we do this and make security bugs over complex?
Why are we still happy with ?Testing security out? rather than the more
superior ?building security in??

20:15 - 21:00 ?Secure Coding, some simple steps help? - Steven van der Baan

Secure coding is often perceived as difficult and complex.
While it is true that 'good security' should be embedded into the design,
there are a couple of steps a developer can take which lead to a more
secure application. In this presentation we will go to the basics of secure
application development and demonstrate these principles which help you
build security into your application. - Secure Coding, some simple steps
help

21:00 - 21:30 Networking
