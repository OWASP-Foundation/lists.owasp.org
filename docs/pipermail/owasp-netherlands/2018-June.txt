Building a Security ?Culture? by Gareth O?Sullivan 20:15 - 21:00: Building
secure software with OWASP tools and guides by Martin Knobloch 21:00 -
Closing Vergader Inn Croeselaan 207 3521 BN Utrecht

*Building a Security ?Culture? * Rushing Towards Digital Transformation
Breaches. Despite significant investments in security technology and
processes, attackers still gain access to protected data on a regular
basis. IT builds higher and higher walls around the locations where data
lives but attacks persist. Mass migration to cloud computing has improved
scalability, lowered costs, and freed IT from having to manage the
application environment. However, this means cloud becomes a target for
attackers, and it becomes more risky to store sensitive data there. BYOD
makes users? devices a target as well. Obviously from a security
standpoint, the greater number of devices there are to manage, the greater
the risk of attack. What to do, and where to start?

*Gareth O?Sullivan* Lead Technology Research Consultant at Genomics
Medicine Ireland, a company helping map the Irish Genome & recently
established as Managing Director of Progress Distribution Ireland a leading
EMEA Cyber Security distributor. Gareth is an IT Security Executive with 20
years? experience in the software industry, 13 of which have been security
focused. Previously Snr Director of Solutions Architecture at WhiteHat
Security covering EMEA plus similar roles in the past with IBM & Watchfire.
Technical, Compliance and Commercially focused so enjoy engaging with
technology but also like to build teams, conducting business development,
sales channel development & pipeline generation.

*Building secure software with OWASP tools and guides* All know the OWASP
TopTen, some one or more other projects. The problem is, where the wiki is
good to archive the project information, it is hard to find information if
you don't know what you are looking for. Therefore, only a few have a
broader understanding of projects (being tools or guides) you can use in
your software development lifecycle, even before, to create more secure
software. This talk is highlighting various OWASP projects taking you from
CISO policies, security requirements to building and secure software and
verifying the security level.

*Martin Knobloch* is security consultant at Xebia.com. His main working
area is (software) security in general, from awareness to implementation.
In his daily work, he is responsible for education in application security
matters, advise and implementation of application security measures. With
his background in Java Development, he understands the complexity of
Enterprise software development, Agile Scrum environments and continuous
delivery / deployment.
