Dear all,

Raul Siles is doing the Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with
Samurai-WTF training at BruCON in 3 weeks
http://2012.brucon.org/index.php/Training_Samurai-WTF
Highly recommended and in need for extra attendees.

FYI - Raul also created the owasp Session Management Cheat Sheet:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet

OWASP members get a 10% discount on the training fee.
We'll throw in one extra free admission to the conference to be
raffled between the people registering for the training with the
discount code.

mail me if you're interested!

hint: becoming member just became interesting :-)
