PresentationsPlaying in the Sandbox: Bypassing Adobe Flash Input Validation

Sandboxing is a popular technique used by vendors to minimize damages that
applications might potentially inflict on a system. Dictated by so-called
sandbox policies, legitimate and malicious code alike are restricted in
their trust boundaries, preventing unauthorized actions.

Input validation plays an important role in enforcing sandbox policies.
With input validation, context often matters: given some policy set, some
input may be allowed, while the same input may be invalid given another.
File paths are a notable example. In Adobe Flash Player, the &quot;remote&quot;
sandbox prohibits local file system access but enables remote connections,
while the &quot;local-with-filesystem&quot; sandbox enables the opposite use case.

While being a seemingly simple input format, validating file paths becomes
increasingly complicated when considering the entire picture. With Flash
constituting the intermediate glue between operating systems and a range of
host environments - web browsers, Microsoft Office, PDF readers - one has a
diverse landscape of path schemes to consider. This leads to challenges in
proper input validation, and as it turns out, subtle but unforgiving
mistakes.

*This talk examines two sandbox escape vulnerabilities I have recently
found in Adobe Flash.*

Tracked as CVE-2016-4271, the first vulnerability details a local sandbox
escape through bypassing input validation, enabling to exfiltrate local
data and obtain Windows user credentials. The second vulnerability, dubbed
CVE-2017-3085, extends the vulnerability to include a remote sandbox
escape, showing by extension that Adobe's patch for the first vulnerability
incompletely solved the issue. In analyzing these vulnerabilities, we
review the underlying causes that rendered them possible: arbitrary
definitions of what constitutes &quot;remote&quot; and &quot;local&quot;, insufficient input
validation schemes, and unmitigated platform-specific vulnerabilities.
Finally, in light of recent efforts to deprecate Adobe Flash, we also
discuss how Flash will remain important in the short and long term - as an
attack vector, and as an object of study.
How to rob a bank

We are going to digitally rob a bank. Not for profit, but as a friendly
match against the security team of this bank. We believe that only perfect
practice makes perfect: by simulating an attack as realistically as
possible, an organisation is optimally prepared for real incidents. Expect
a very practical presentation about modern hacker techniques combined with
lessons learned from security teams in defending against targeted attacks.
SpeakersBj&#246;rn Ruytenberg

Bj&#246;rn Ruytenberg is an Information Security student at Eindhoven University
of Technology and Radboud University. Being a technology enthusiast, he has
graduated in the field of Electrical Engineering, and cum laude in the
field of Computer Science. His special interests include hardware and
software security, in particular when the case at hand stretches across the
former disciplines. Aside from his work as a software developer, he is an
active participant in bug bounty programs.
Pieter Ceelen

Pieter&#8217;s first &#8216;hack&#8217; was adjusting the sprites in Space Invaders on his
MSX and claiming that the aliens now looked like his little sister. 15
Years later he later turned his hobby into profession at KPMG, hacking and
advising multinational companies (instead of Space Invaders). In 2016,
together with three other experts, Pieter founded Outflank: a company
specialised in red teaming and attack simulations. Besides being a very
experienced hacker and pentester, Pieter brings years of incident response,
forensics and threat intelligence knowledge to the table. This allows him
to tune his attacks and use the tools and techniques employed by real
attackers in red teaming and attack simulations.
