Subject: [Owasp Netherlands Chapter] OWASP volunteers wanted @ Devoxx

Hi OWASP members,

For this years Devoxx conference (https://devoxx.com/), November 8, 9 and
10th in Antwerp, we are looking for volunteers to represent OWASP at our
conference booth!

We have 4 booth passes available, to be shared with more than one volunteer
as I assume not all can make it all 3 days (Tuesday to Thursday). You will
be able to attend talks, the more volunteers we have (max 4), the better we
can spread the load and the ability to see talks!

There is some limited funds to reimburse travel or hotel expenses.

If you are interested, please fill in your details here:

With kind regards,
Martin Knobloch
