Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] First OWASP Netherlands Chapter Meeting
Message-ID: <34606.127.0.0.1.1126523102.squirrel@www.khemradj.com>

Welcome all!

To the OWASP Netherlands local chapter. This chapter gives an excellent
opportunity to give web application security a central place in The
Netherlands. Activities like meetings and the mailing list can serve as a
discussion platform, to share ideas, get feedback, to gain knowledge, meet
other enthusiasts, promote security awareness and even earn CPE credits
for CISSP's!

The first chapter meeting is in planning stage, targeted for Thursday 27
October starting at 18.00h. A venue is kindly offered by Ascure B.V. in
Nieuwegein. In this meeting, we can discuss about the actual form of the
Dutch chapter: the people, activities, sponsorship, deliverables, etc. And
we are actively looking for speakers who want to share their expert
knowledge and opinions.

Please tell other people, who might be interested, of the OWASP
Netherlands local chapter! And please share your ideas on the mailing
list, and of course let me know if you're interested in attending the
first meeting.

See you soon!


Best Regards,
