Presentations Handling of Security Requirements in Software Development
Lifecycle

The bigger the company you're working in, the more technologies and
methodologies used by development teams you are going to face. At the same
time, you want to address security risks in an appropriate, reliable and
measurable way for all of them.

After a short introduction of a unified process for handling security
requirements in a large company, the main part of the talk is going to
focus on a tool called SecurityRAT (Requirement Automation Tool) which has
been developed in order to support and accelerate this process. The goal of
the tool is first to provide a list of relevant security requirements
according to properties of the developed software, and afterwards to handle
these in a mostly automated way - integration with an issue tracker being
used as a core feature.

The tool was open sourced in May 2016 (available at
<A HREF="https://github.com/SecurityRAT">https://github.com/SecurityRAT</A>) and is continuously being further developed
since then. The newest implemented features, work in progress and future
plans will form the last part of the talk.
Hacking the OWASP Juice Shop

OWASP Juice Shop* is an intentionally insecure web app suitable for
pentesting and security awareness trainings written in Node.js, Express and
AngularJS. It is the first application written entirely in JavaScript
listed in the OWASP VWA Directory. It also seems to be the first broken web
app that uses the currently popular architecture of an SPA/RIA frontend
with a RESTful backend.

In this talk I will show why and how the app was created followed by a demo
how to hack it. Prepare for some nasty XSS, SQLI and CSRF flaws bundled
with some seriously broken access control and business logic - all in one
single application!

(*Translating &quot;dump&quot; or &quot;useless outfit&quot; into German yields &quot;Saftladen&quot;
which can be reverse-translated word by word into &quot;juice shop&quot;. Hence the
project name. That the initials &quot;JS&quot; match with those of &quot;JavaScript&quot; was
purely coincidental!)
Speakers Daniel Kefer

1&amp;1 Mail &amp; Media Development &amp; Techhnology GmbH, Head of Application
Security

Daniel Kefer has been working in the application security field since 2007.
Having started as a penetration tester, he soon became passionate about
proactive security efforts and working closely with developers. Since 2011
he has been working for 1&amp;1 where he focuses on design and continuous
improvement of the internal secure SDLC process and its implementation in
different development departments. Apart from 1&amp;1, he also works as a
volunteer for the OWASP OpenSAMM project.
Ren&#233; Reuter

Robert Bosch GmbH, IT Security Consultant

Ren&#233; Reuter is a security engineer with over 4 years of experience in the
application security field. At Robert Bosch GmbH, he works as an IT
Security Consultant responsible for identifying vulnerabilities and design
flaws that may impact Robert Boschs' applications and infrastructure. Ren&#233;
holds a Master's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Applied
Sciences Karlsruhe.
Bj&#246;rn Kimminich

Bj&#246;rn Kimminich is working in the area of software development for Kuehne +
Nagel for over 8 years where he is now responsible for Global IT
Architecture. His most sophisticated Open Source work is the intentionally
insecure web application Juice Shop, which just recently was accepted as an
OWASP Tool Project. As a side job he lectures software development at the
UAS Nordakademie where he teaches Java to engineering students as their
first programming language.
