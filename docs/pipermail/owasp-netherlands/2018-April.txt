Smart Contracts for Fun and ACTUAL Profit by Bernhard Mueller 21:00 -
Closing Where:
InspireVoetiusstraat 2 3512 JM Utrecht

*Adding Privacy by Design in Secure Application Development* The General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is coming. One monumental change is the
introduction of Privacy by Design. In this presentation we will focus on
the Privacy by Design (PbD) implications for developers. Two cornerstones
for a successful implementation of PbD will be pitched: 1) the integration
of GDPR in a Secure Development Lifecycle approach 2) threat modeling and
GDPR risk patterns

*Sebastien Deleersnyder* is Co-founder & managing partner application
security at Toreon.com. Sebastien has helped various companies improve
their ICT-, Web- and Mobile Security, including BNP Paribas Fortis, Atos
Worldline, KBC, Nationale Nederlanden (ING), Isabel, Fluxys, OLAF, EU
Council, TNT Post, Flemish Community, Agfa-Gevaert and ING Insurance
International. Sebastien is the Belgian OWASP Chapter Leader, co-project
leader of the OWASP SAMM project, served on the OWASP Foundation Board
member (2007-2013) and performed several presentations and trainings on Web
Application, Mobile and Web Services Security. Ethereum is an open software
blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy
decentralized apps. Over the past couple of years, its cryptocurrency Ether
has taken the number two spot in market cap second to Bitcoin.

*Smashing Ethereum Smart Contracts for Fun and ACTUAL Profit* In Ethereum,
state transitions are mediated by code (a.k.a ?smart contracts?) running in
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which boasts a turing-complete
instruction set, allowing for near-unlimited use cases including (but not
limited to) crypto kitties. However, with great flexibility comes great
potential for vulnerabilities. And in accordance to Murphy?s law, disaster
has stricken several times, resulting in hundreds of millions worth of
Ether being stolen or stuck in limbo for all eternity. In this talk, I will
investigate recent incidents, and shed light on the various types of flaws
that occur in Ethereum smart contracts. I?ll show how to explore the
blockchain and reverse engineer smart contract binary code using Mythril,
the ?nmap of Ethereum?. I?ll also demonstrate the use of symbolic analysis
to detect different types of vulnerabilities, including those resulting
from inter-contract calls. Finally, I?ll show how to autogenerate Ethereum
exploits using the Z3 solver.

*Bernhard Mueller* is a security engineer at Consensys and a hacker with a
decade-long track record. He has found dozens of zero day flaws in widely
used software, published attacks on core Internet protocols, and written
award-winning papers. He is also a winner of BlackHat?s ?Best Research?
Pwnie Award.

extra profit.

We want to invest some of our profits by sponsoring 3 Open Security Summit
tickets.
The value is about 1.600 GBP each, covering shared accommodation and access
to the summit venue for the whole week.
(for more info - https://open-security-summit.org)

Please submit your candidacy listing:
1) why we would sponsor you?
2) the working session(s) you will be organising?
3) the outcome for the community?

Please use the Google form here: https://goo.gl/forms/qyKIn2SEkH7ZnO1L2
We will consider all applications that have reached us (Martin & myself)
