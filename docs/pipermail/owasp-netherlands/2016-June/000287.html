Location:
Surfnet 273 Radboudkwartier 3511 CK Utrecht Presentations:
Find and fix software security problems&#8230; wait, do not make security
mistakes in the first place!

Today, companies do not have a shortage of known security problems in their
solutions. Tools and people point out numerous software security problems
that eventually should be fixed. So how do organizations deal with all
these issues? What is the most effective way to get issues fixed? For
companies taking security serious, the question is no longer &#8220;How many
problems can you find?&#8221;, but the real question is &#8220;How many security issues
can you fix or prevent developers from making?&#8221; In this session, we explore
different routes on how to find and fix security issues, or prevent making
them in the first place.
How to keep your secrets saf(er) on an Android device

Alternatives to &#8216;just don&#8217;t&#8217;

In this presentation we will visit several approaches on how you can try to
keep a secret within your Android applications. We cover various subjects:
from guarding your authentication information to keeping your keys a
secret.

Speakers:
Matias Madou

Matias is the founder of Sensei Security, a software security startup
building solutions to effectively fix and prevent security problems in
software. Matias has over a decade of hands-on software security experience
ranging from the research to improve existing solutions to scoping and
building new solutions. A dozen patents and a bunch of papers are the
result of his research that eventually led to a hand full of commercial
products.
Jeroen Willemsen

Jeroen is a full stack developer specialized in IT security at Xebia with a
passion for mobile and risk management. He has developed multiple
applications and loves to spend time on tinkering with security tooling and
new technologies.
