Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] OWASP Meeting 9 March
Message-ID: <4406C3D5.2070408@irc2.nl>

You're welcome to the second meeting of the OWASP Netherlands local chapter!

In this second meeting focus groups are to be formed, to discuss common problems, develop and research common solutions in a vendor neutral
environment. So this is a very good opportunity to get in contact with others, to exchange knowledge and experiences on specific topics.

For every focus group the following questions has to be answered:
1. Which specific topic is to be addressed?
2. What are the deliverables?
3. What is the relation to OWASP? (Current projects, materials, expertise and knowledge interchange, etc.)
4. Who is the central contact of the subgroup?

It would be nice to have a bigger and more diverse group, compared to the first meeting. So let's recall: "Please, bring at least one friend, next
time." And don't hesitate to sent this announcement to everybody who may be interested!

We thank Getronics PinkRoccade for offering us a venue:
Getronics PinkRoccade
Fauststraat 1
7323 BA Apeldoorn

The agenda:
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In (bread & drinks)
18.30 - 18.45 Opening
18.45 - 19.30 Improving Security in the Application Development Life-cycle, Migchiel de Jong
19.30 - 20.00 Collecting focus group initiatives
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break
20.00 - 21.00 Form focus groups

Presentation Abstract
Rather than spending large amounts of time and money on proving that we have security vulnerabilities after programs go into production, companies
should go to the source and correct vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development stage. It is unquestionably faster, simpler, and cheaper
for developers to correct vulnerabilities as they build programs.
But how can development management ensure that developers focus on security when there is no time or budget for security at the development stage?
Even with the correct focus, how can they learn what to look for? How can they stay ahead of the dedicated and resourceful hacker?
The answer is effective processes and better tools. With advanced software security tools, a developer can pinpoint vulnerabilities in a matter of
seconds ? the same vulnerabilities that would take a hacker or manual code reviewer weeks or even months to find.
These same tools can give development and information security managers useful metrics on application vulnerabilities before they are released into
deployment.
This talk will walk through the Application Development Life-Cycle and discuss how tools can help come to grips with software security issues in a
particular phase.

About the presenter
Migchiel de Jong has developed hardware and software for 10 years before joining Rational Software. During the 5 years at Rational Software (later
acquired by IBM) he was involved in many software development process improvement projects. Currently Migchiel de Jong is working at Fortify Software,
Palo Alto, California, as a software security engineer.

If you want to attend send an email to owasp at irc2.nl. Please don't wait, 9 march is not that long anymore!

All OWASP chapter meetings are free, there are never vendor pitches or sales presentations at OWASP meetings.

NOTE TO CISSP?s: OWASP Meetings count towards CPE Credits.

Bert Koelewijn

Goedemorgen all,

Dat is de methodiek die ik noemde, volgens mij moet er iets samen te
voegen zijn... zonde van iedereen zijn tijd om opnieuw hetzelfde wiel
uit te vinden.

Mvg,

Arthur

Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] OWASP Netherlands meeting minutes
Message-ID: <44255A26.2040502@irc2.com>

On 9 march, the second meeting of OWASP Netherlands local chapter took place. GetronicsPinkRoccade provided the venue, in their luxury conference 
centre: Connection I.

Agenda:
18.00 - 18.45 Check-In (bread & drinks)
18.45 - 19.00 Opening
19.00 - 20.00 Improving Security in the Application Development Life-cycle, Migchiel de Jong
20.00 - 20.15 Coffee break
20.15 - 22.00 Form focus groups

The presentation of Migchiel de Jong was found very interesting by the audience. At the end of his presentation, he demonstrated a static code 
analysis of the OWASP webgoat application.

After the coffee break, the attendances started discussing about the largest common topics of interest in the web application security field, in 
relation to the OWASP Netherlands chapter. As a result, the following focus groups are formed:

Testing
The current OWASP Testing project and the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual of ISECOM, provide guidelines and best practices for 
testers. These guidelines can be used to formalize a standard structure and a set of minimum requirements for a security test. Clients could ask a 
tester to adhere to these guidelines.
A second idea is to standardize the testing results management report. In practice, testing could result in piles of paper with all the findings. The 
real value is reporting it in a usable way. For example: mapping technical findings to business risks.

First focus group meeting: Monday 27 march, 18:00h, PwC Utrecht


Public Relations
This focus group will try to make business aware of the security impact that developing, hosting and using web applications has. What OWASP is and how 
OWASP can help. This can be done by giving presentations, writing papers and articles, word of mouth, etc. etc.

Ronald Eygendaal
Bas van Vossen
Edwin van Vliet
Eelco Klaver

First presentation of OWASP materials: Edwin van Vliet, TestNet - Voorjaarsevenement, 5 april
First focus group meeting: To be planned!


Education
OWASP and universities/schools could benefit from working together. For example:
- OWASP provides lot's of materials usable in colleges.
- Develop OWASP training course.
- Students can participate in OWASP projects
- OWASP can provide a platform for supporting research. Such as thesis projects, etc.
- OWASP representatives could provide guest colleges.

Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] [Owasp-world] Reminder: 2006 European OWASP AppSec Conference - May 30-31, 2006 near Brussels
Message-ID: <02db01c650e0$f9251050$1204a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is holding its annual European AppSec (Application Security)
Conference May 30-31, 2006 at the Catholic University of Leuven (aka
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or K.U. Leuven) in Leuven, which is 25 km
from Brussels.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES: Early registration for the conference ends April 30.
The reduced rates for the conference hotels ends mid to late April depending
on the hotel.

AGENDA: This conference has dual tracks like last years' US conference. The
speakers and agenda are available on the OWASP website at:

             http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html.

This year's speakers include popular speakers from previous conferences like
Dinis Cruz and Ivan Ristic, but also includes many new speakers to the OWASP
Conference, including Andrew Van Der Stock (project lead for the OWASP
Guide), Roger Thornton (CTO of Fortify), Mike Andrews of Foundstone, and
myself (Dave Wichers - COO of Aspect Security).

NEW: We also have introduced for the first time two panels, which should
generate some lively debate. The first panel is on "Should companies be
emulating Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)?" and the 2nd is
on: "Are we winning the war?" - Are we actually getting a handle on
application security issues and making things better, or are things still
getting worse?

REGISTRATION DETAILS: Registration is open and the conference fee is 300
Euros for early registration and 350 Euros for registrations after April 30,
2006.

TUTORIALS - May 29, 2006:

OWASP has arranged to have two one-day tutorials the day prior to the
conference. These one day tutorials will be held at the university and are
only 600 Euros for conference attendees.

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE: This powerful hands on course
focuses on the most common web application security problems, including the
OWASP Top Ten. The course introduces and demonstrates hacking techniques,
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students
really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code. 

WEB SERVICES and XML SECURITY: The movement towards Web Services and Service
Oriented architecture (SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to
deal with new risks posed by these architectures. This session takes a
pragmatic approach towards identifying Web Services security risks and
selecting and applying countermeasures to the application, code, web
servers, databases, application, and identity servers and related software.

More details on these training courses are available at:

        http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/training.html 

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - May 30, 2006: The traditional evening dinner/social
event is being held at the nearby Faculty Club. The Faculty club is a
restaurant annex conference centre located in a medieval part of Leuven. We
can walk there from the conference, and will have a social hour followed by
a 3-course dinner. Dinner is typically followed by drinks nearby. The dinner
event is 40 Euros.

HOTELS - We have arranged for conference rates at nearby hotels. Many of
these rates expire mid to late April, so please book early. More information
is available at:

 
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/accommodations.html 

If you know others that would be interested in attending this OWASP
conference, please forward them this email and let them know about this
opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Thanks, Dave

Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] Call for presentations, SAFE-NL, Thursday June 8, 2006
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0603291805010.23169-100000@lambik.cs.kun.nl>

Hallo,

Ter info de call for presentations van de Safe-NL workshop in juni. 

Safe-NL is een 2 jaarlijkse bijeenkomst op security gebied, die we
organseren samen met een paar universiteiten en incidenteel ook 
bedrijven.  De bedoeling is een gelegenheid te bieden waar mensen
uit bedrijfsleven en onderzoek bij elkaar kunnen komen om ideeen
uit te wisselen en contacten op te doen.  In die zin is het
wel vergelijkbaar met OWASP, zij het dat het een puur Nederlandse
aangelegenheid is, en het op een veel breder gebied van computer 
security richt. 

We zijn nog een beetje zoekende voor de juiste opzet voor Safe-NL:
eerder hadden we enkel uitgenodigde sprekers, meestal twee uit
bedrijfsleven en twee van universiteiten, over allerhande onderwerpen, 
nu hebben we een eerst een open call for presentations enigszins 
gefocussed op een thema.  (Enigszins in navolging van de opzet
van de Testdag, voor het geval jullie daar mee bekend zijn.)

Het thema voor komende bijeenkomst is wellicht niet zo interessant 
voor OWASPers, maar als een van jullie iets wil komen vertellen 
laat het gerust weten. Het is nog maar de vraag of we een dag kunnen 
vullen met praatjes die allemaal over dit thema gaan.

Mijn plan was eigenlijk om bij de tweede bijeenkomst dit jaar (ergens 
in November) rond het thema web-security op te zetten. Dit zou een
leuke gelegenheid zijn om de issues in de OWASP community voor een 
breder voetlicht te brengen.  

Groeten,
Erik Poll

SAFE NL provides a forum for practitioners, implementors and researchers from
industry, government agencies and research institutions to exchange ideas on
the state of the art in security technology, current and novel application
areas of this technology, and on the requirements for effective deployment of
secure systems.

To this end, SAFE-NL organises informal, one-day workshops on the state of
affairs in security applications, deployment and research in the
Netherlands. The workshop is free-of-charge. Following on the success of these
workshops over the past years, SAFE-NL expects that the number of participants
from industry and government will continue to grow (i.e. between 50 - 100
participants). SAFE-NL offers a program with informative presentations on
research results from industry, government and universities.

We are soliciting proposals for presentations to be held at the next SAFE-NL
workshop, from business/industry, academia, government and others. The theme
for the next workshop is 'Security in RFID and contactless cards' as used in
RFID tags, ePassport, EMV cards and ID cards for public
transport. Presentations linked to this theme are especially welcomed, but all
presentations on topics related to security and cryptography fall within scope
of the workshop and will be considered for presentation by the program
committee.

The format of the SAFE-NL workshop sees a few changes. There is room for two
more talks and each talk is 10 minutes shorter. Further, talks will be selected
by a program committee based on submitted proposals. The program committee
consists of

* Marc Witteman, Riscure 
* Paul Samwel, Rabobank 
* Wan Fokkink, Free University Amsterdam 
* Jaap-Henk Hoepman, Radboud University Nijmegen 

Format of the presentations
---------------------------

Presentations should expose some new ideas, insight or experience, and explain
it to a wider audience. When submitting a proposal and preparing a
presentation, keep in mind that the audience is broad, and includes academic
scientists, business professionals, civil servants, and others. The slides of
the presentations should be provided to the SAFE-NL workshop organisers in
electronic format, for inclusion on the SAFE-NL website.

Presentations should be 35 minutes long, allowing for at least 5 minutes of
questions and answers.

We should stress the purpose of the workshop is to exchange ideas and
experiences; sales-pitches will be rejected outright.  When giving your
presentation, a one slide introduction of your company will be appreciated
though.

Submission of proposals
-----------------------

The proposal should contain:

* the name and affiliation of the person giving the presentation,
* the title of the presentation, and
* a brief (half page) abstract of what the presentation is about.

Proposals can be sent to Jaap-Henk Hoepman (jhh at cs.ru.nl).

Important dates
---------------

Please respect the following deadlines.

* Submission deadline: Saturday, April 29, 2006, 24:00 GMT.
* Notification: Saturday, May 6, 2006, 24:00 GMT.

The selection process
---------------------

The proposals will be reviewed by the program committee and all submitters will
be notified of the decision a few weeks before the actual workshop.  Proposals
may be rejected because they are out of scope, are of insufficient quality or
simply because there were too many good quality proposals.  Also, high quality
proposals may be kept for future workshops, because the topic would not fit the
other presentations in the program very well.  This will be discussed with the
proposers on an individual basis.

The program and registration information will announced at a later stage.   

We look forward to your contributions!
