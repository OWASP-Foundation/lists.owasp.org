To: "owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org" <owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>



Hi folks,

after having some luck and with a little bit of work in order to
constitute two splendid program committees we're just released the
"Call for Ps". One for the research track, one regular industry
tracks:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2013/CfPresos
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2013/CfPapers

If you think you can contribute with your presentation or
paper something to the topics listed in the CfPs, you're
cordially invited to submit a proposal.

We look forward to a great http://AppSec.EU/ conference this
August in Hamburg.

Feel free to spread the word / this mail.


Best,

Dirk
