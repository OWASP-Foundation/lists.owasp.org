Hello list,

It is really quiet on this list. Any news? Any interesting meetings?
Any ideas we might share/work on?

Has anyone seen the speed with which the ESAPI and the Certification
project are proceeding? If you have not, please check it out. To me
these are probably the most interesting OWASP projects at this moment.

When is the next NL OWASP event planned?

Regards,
Mario

Hey Mario,

Funny thing, I was just thinking the same thing last week. Unfortunately I
don't have any news either. I know the last meeting was planned in june, but
unfortunately it was cancelled .. as far as I know no new date has been
planned for it.

Another interesting project by the way is the development of version 3 of
the OWASP Testing Guide !

Hello guys,

Tonight we meet to make an agenda for September and December. But to give a hint... For September we found speakers that can tell us about digital identity and privacy, technology and laws. And in December we plan to have a workshop on risk analysis of software architecture and design, given by two internationally respected gentleman. Details still have to be worked out.

But let us be clear, contributions to the OWASP NL chapter, like presentations, workshops and sponsoring are always very welcome!!! We would like to build a repository of speakers, so we are always covered for OWASP meetings when a speaker unexpectedly draws back or gets ill.

See you in September!

Best Regards,

Bert
OWASP Netherlands chapter team
