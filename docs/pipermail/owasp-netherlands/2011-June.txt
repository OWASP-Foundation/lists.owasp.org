Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] Web application security training
Message-ID: <3DCE322EB159AF43B69CB999101C371A3598B51B@mailprdnl02.ms.fbh>

Dear Owasp members,
  My company wants to send me to a training/conference that mainly talks about web application security from a web programmer perspective. Despite my deep googling I only find trainings outside the Europe. I am based in Amsterdam and only want to travel inside Europe. If you know any of a training location that teaches how to write secure code against vulnerabilities, that would be great as we urgently need to expertise ourselves about this topic inside our company.

Best Regards,
Tunca

delivering the most comprehensive enumeration of all known web service
attacks.

Hi Tunca,

There are various  application security training's available, inside and
outside of Europe.
The major question is, what is your level of understanding and what is your
focus area?

We, as OWASP, do not yet offer training's, other then during OWASP
conference.
The previous OWASP conference has been in Dublin, Ireland last week.
Unfortunately you just have missed that opportunity.

Your company might consider train a whole development team rather to send
developers out to training's one by one. We as OWASP are independent to
vendors and therefore to not push or forward to any vendors or training
institution. This means, I can not recommend you any of the training
offering organizations.

Cerditeurope.nl might already have some contacts of preferred suppliers for
training in general. Best is to ask them for the training you require and
pick the best offer from there.

With kind regards,
-Martin
