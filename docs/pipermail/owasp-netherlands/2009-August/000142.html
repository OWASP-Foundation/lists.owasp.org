Shreeraj is in town for the BruCON conference (www.brucon.org) where he will

engineer techniques, Cloud Computing Security, Open source Information
gathering, Dangers of Social Networks, and much more, there will be
interesting workshops and other events. More information about the program

high-quality 2 day conference in Brussels.
