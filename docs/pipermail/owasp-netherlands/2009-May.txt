Hello,

The Luxembourg Chapter will participate to the next
YAJUG<http://www.yajug.org>(Java User Group, Luxembourg) event:

*YAJUG - How to Secure your Java Applications
*Wednesday, May 27th 2009 - 17:45*

*Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor
29, avenue John F. Kennedy
L-1855 Luxembourg-Kirchberg*
*
Agenda:

*17h45* - Welcome and registration

*18h00* - *Introduction to Cryptography with JCA and JCE*, S?bastien
Stormacq, Sun Microsystems

This talk will introduce basic cryptography mechanisms such as one-way hash
functions, encryption, signature, public key cryptography, certificate etc
... in order to let everyone catch up with these very often used but rarely
understood technologies.
After having described the theoritical and the mathematical concepts used by
modern cryptography, this talk will demonstrate how to apply these in your
Java applications. We will show how to use the Java Cryptography
Architecture framework and Sun's Java Cryptography Extension providers to
actually write your own data encryption or data signature code.

*19h15* - *OWASP Top 10 Security Breaches for Java Web Applications*,
Jocelyn Aubert, OWASP-LU

The OWASP Top Ten provides a powerful awareness document for web application
security. It lists the top ten most critical web application security
vulnerabilities, and for each provides explanation, examples, means of
verification and recommendations to avoid it.
"*Adopting the OWASP Top Ten is perhaps the most effective first step
towards changing the software development culture within your organization
into one that produce secure code.*"

*20h30* - Drink

*Note:* This event is *NOT* an OWASP event! You have to register on YAJUG
website (fee: 40 euros).

Kind regards,
--

  *18.30 ? 18.45 Introduction (OWASP organization, projects, sponsor) *

*18.45 - 19.45 AppSec-EU 2009 (Sebastien Deleersnyder, OWASP Foundation
Board, Telindus) *
Update on the AppSec-EU 2009:
OWASP State of the union, an update on OWASP and OWASP projects and of
course the highlights of the AppSec-EU 2009 presentations.

*19.45 ? 20.00 Break *

*20.00 ? 20.30 VAC Cross-Site Request Forgery (Niels Teusink, Fox-IT) *
CSRF is an attack which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a
web application in which he/she is currently authenticated. With a little
help of social engineering (like sending a link via email/chat), an attacker
may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the
attacker's choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data
and operation in case of normal user. If the targeted end user is the
administrator account, this can compromise the entire web application.

Niels Teusink holds a bachelor degree in Computer Science and has been
experimenting with IT security for over a decade. He has worked for Fox-IT
since 2005; first as a software engineer and since 2007 as a penetration
tester. He has since performed dozens of penetration tests for all sorts of
companies, including governments, banks and nuclear installations.

*20.30 ? 21.15 Open session / discussion (Martin Knobloch/Ferdinand
Vroom/Peter Gouwentak) *
Open session / discussion about subjects brought forward by the attendees.
