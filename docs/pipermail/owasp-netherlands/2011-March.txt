[ We regret if you get this message more than once.]

Dear Master and Phd Students, academic/industrial researchers and  
practitioners,

next summer from 4 to 8 July 2011, the Computer Systems Lab at Ghent  
University organizes the second International Summer School on  
Information Security and Protection. The topic of this summer school  
is Software Security and Protection, with all the courses focusing on  
compiler technology and related system software. This summer school  
rotates between Asia, Europe and the Americas, so this year presents a  
unique opportunity for European researchers and practitioners to  
broaden and deepen their knowledge and to meet some top researchers in  
the area of software security and protection.

For more information, please check out the website at http://issisp.elis.ugent.be

The registration deadline is 7 April 2011, and the number of  
participants will be limited to ensure the quality of the event.

Best regards,

prof. Bjorn De Sutter
Summer School Organizer
Computer Systems Lab
Ghent University
