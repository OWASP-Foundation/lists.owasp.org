Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] Call for VAC
Message-ID: <175b3dbd0812150604l4f9b3593n645765039deef4eb@mail.gmail.com>

All,

This year, we introduced the VAC for the OWASP NL Chapter meetings.

Unfortunately, only once we managed to actually have a VAC talk at a chapter
meeting.

As we see from the questionairies, there is a great demand of
indepth technical information.
The VAC is the definitely the way to response to this demand.

What is the VAC:
*Vunerability, **Attack, **Countermeasure,*
The goal is an half hour presentation about a vulnerability, how it can be
exploided and how to prevent it!

*VAC's so far:*
  SQL injection by Marinus Kuivenhoven

*VAC's planned:*
  XSS bij Martin Visser

If you are interessted in presenting a VAC, please send an email to
martin.knobloch at owasp.org

With kind regards,

Martin Knobloch
