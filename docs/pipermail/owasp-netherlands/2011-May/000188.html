*The Ghost of XSS Past, Present and Future. A Defensive Tale.*

This talk will discuss the past methods used for XSS defense that were only
partially effective. Learning from these lessons, will will also discuss
present day defensive methodologies that are effective, but place an undue
burden on the developer. We will then finish with a discussion of future XSS
defense mythologies that shift the burden of XSS defense from the developer
to various frameworks. These include auto-escaping template technologies,
browser-based defenses such as Content Security Policy, and Javascript
sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project and JSReg
