*DESCRIPTION:*
How I Met Your Girlfriend: The discovery and execution of entirely new
classes of Web attacks in order to meet your girlfriend.

This includes entertaining and newly discovered attacks including PHP
session prediction and random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session
cookies), browser protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP
server), firewall and NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your router
against you), extracting extremely accurate geolocation information from a
Web browser (not using IP geolocation), and more.

Speakers BIO:*
Samy Kamkar is best known for the Samy worm, the first XSS worm, infecting
over one million users on MySpace in less than 24 hours. A co-founder of
Fonality, Inc., an IP PBX company, Samy previously led the development of
top-level domain name server software and systems for Global Domains
International (.ws).

In the past 10 years, Samy has focused on evolutionary and genetic
algorithmic software development, Voice over IP software development,
automated security and vulnerability research in network security, reverse
engineering, and network gaming. When not strapped behind the Matrix, Samy
can be found stunt driving and getting involved in local community service
projects.

Dear Sir,Madam,

I'd like to register for the chaptermeeting on September 23rd.

As this would be my first meeting, I'm not sure how everything works.
I can arrive at either 18:10 or 19:10 (by train), so I'd like to know
when the event effectively starts to prevent me either being very
early or late.


Best regards,

Philippe Monnaie
