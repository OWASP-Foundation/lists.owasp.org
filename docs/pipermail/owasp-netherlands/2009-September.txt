*Program*

18.00 - 18.30 *Check-In* (catering included)



18.30 ? 18:45 *Introduction* (OWASP organization, projects, sponsor)



18.45 - 19.45 *Unauthoriz**ed Access*




Wil Allsopp



Physical Penetration Testing and Social Engineering have been conducted by
testing organisations for some time but there has been very little
discussion within the industry regarding the use of formal approaches
ensuring a consistently high quality and repeatability of the testing
lifecycle.

This was a problem I attempted to address in the book Unauthorized Access
and is the focus of this discussion.

We will look at the following:



   - What is physical penetration testing and what does it aim to achieve?
   - Tactical approaches to Social Engineering in testing.
   - The advantages and disadvantages of deploying SE.
   - Training operators and building operating teams - what skill sets
   should you deploy?
   - What are the legal aspects involved, how do these vary between
   jurisdictions?
   - How should you plan a physical penetration test at strategic, tactical
   and operational levels?
   - How do you gauge risk i.e. Contractual, Operational, Legal and
   Environmental?



The biggest problem currently facing physical penetration testing teams is
that it's hard to prove a negative i.e. a failed test by no means guarantees
the security of the client. By ensuring your team is trained and prepared
you can mitigate this problem to a large degree.
