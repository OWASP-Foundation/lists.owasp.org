view. The speakers will give specific examples and of course there is time to ask questions about your own 
experiences.

Subject: [Owasp-netherlands] NLUUG spring conference 2008 over security
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0712191311120.25816@lambik.cs.ru.nl>

Hi all,

Just noticed that theme of next NLUUG spring conference in Ede is security:

http://www.nluug.nl/events/vj08/CfP-NL.html

(NLUUG is the former NL Unix Users Groups which has slightly
broadened its scope.)

They are looking for people with "good stories" on security issues.
Maybe a nice event to present something or meet up with
like-minded people.

Deadline for abstracts is already Dec 31.

Cheers,
Erik
