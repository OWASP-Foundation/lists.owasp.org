<PRE>On 29 and 30 march, I and irC2 director Remco Bakker, spoke on a web application security conference in Copenhagen. My presentation was an 
introduction to OWASP and the Netherlands local chapter. Remco spoke about web application security in the context of the Benelux market.

The event was organized by IBC Euroforum and FortConsult and had no correlation with OWASP (yet). But it would have perfectly fit as an OWASP event. 
Maybe we should consider organizing such an event with the OWASP Netherlands community.

The first day was full of presentations, of course about the many risks that we all are subjected to, a lot about testing, risk based testing, 
security testing, certification frameworks, information strategies, secure programming, etc. etc.

Even the satirical cartoon matter showed up. It seems that nearly thousand Danish websites were defaced by pro-Islamic hackers in a very short period 
of time. This 'threat' was used as an example of the current risks that web applications are subjected to.

And there was our Introduction to OWASP presentation. Some people already knew about OWASP, but most didn't. The reactions were very positive, most 
were surprised to see such a large community of people collaborating on the subject.

On the second day workshops were given by consultants of FortConsult. The day started with the best awareness strategy: let people break in web 
applications there selves! After that, one could play with the most well known vulnerabilities. At the end some tips and resources were given to 
better your life.

And now the best news... the OWASP local chapter map now has one red dot more. Ulf and Lars from FortConsult, are setting up a local chapter in 
Denmark! I wish them all the best with the new chapter.

Greetings,

Bert Koelewijn
