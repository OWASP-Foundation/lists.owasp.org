<PRE>Hello all,

For the upcoming OWASP chapter meeting we have the following speakers until now. The date for the upcoming meeting is again 
problematic, because I could not manage to get a third speaker. Therefore I want to do a call for a .NET security specialist 
that would like to organize a .NET demo/workshop for the upcoming OWASP meeting. The evening should have a real added value 
for .NET developers and architects!

Boaz Shunami
------------
Boaz is manager of the Application Security department of Comsec Europe. He has 11 years of experience in the IT Security 
field, and a large part of them in Application Security.
Boaz did numerous application security audits in very large organizations and is recognized as one of the greatest experts 
world wide. Boaz' expertise is broad, but especially in-depth for the .NET platform.

Sebastien Deleersnyder
----------------------
Sebastien is the OWASP local chapter leader of the Belgium chapter and has recently started the OWASP Education Project:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project</A>

The Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be 
combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences. He will introduce the Education Project and show us the 
value of information and awareness that is specifically targeted at the various audiences. And of course hopes to get some 
people to volunteer for contributing to the project.

Hopefully we will meet very soon!

Best Regards,

Bert Koelewijn
OWASP Netherlands local chapter
