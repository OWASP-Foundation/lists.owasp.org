	June 13 meeting in conjunction with UtahSec

Greetings,

This month's meeting is scheduled for the second Thursday of the month June
13th to accommodate our speaker's schedule who is coming to us all the way
from Hawaii. Jim Manico of WhiteHat Security will be presenting on Top Ten
Web Defenses. See you all there! Details below:

*Date:*

*Thursday, June 13 2013*


*Time:*

*6 - 8 pm*


*Meeting location:*

*LDS Riverton Office Building*

*3740 W 13400 S*

*Riverton, UT 84065*


*Presentation:*

*Top Ten Web Defenses*

*Presenter: Jim Manico - VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security,
a web security firm.*

*Food Sponsor: TBD*

*Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings*

*Title: Top Ten Web Defenses*
We cannot ?firewall? or ?patch? our way to secure websites. In the past,
security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
well-protected websites are occurring every day. Citigroup, PBS, Sega,
Nintendo, Gawker, AT&T, the CIA, the US Senate, NASA, Nasdaq, the NYSE,
Zynga, and thousands of others have something in common ? all have had
websites compromised in the last year. No company or industry is immune.
Programmers need to learn to build websites differently. This talk will
review the top coding techniques developers need to master in order to
build a low-risk, high-security web application.

*BIO:* Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat
Security, a web security firm. He authors and delivers developer
security awareness training for WhiteHat Security and has a background
as a software developer and architect. Jim is also a global board member
for the OWASP foundation. He manages and participates in several OWASP
projects, including the OWASP cheat sheet series and the OWASP podcast
series.

Very exciting!  I'm a big fan of Jim.  I saw him present on XSS at a sans
event last year.  The audience erupted in applause 1 minute into the
presentation after his intro.

Yes, we are very fortunate to have Jim come speak to us. Our companies
partner so I can also vouch for Jim's level of expertise and quality of his
presentations.

I've invited co-workers who want to come but are unable to.  Is anyone
planning on recording this?  If not, may I?

Cam,

I don't know of any arrangements made to record this but if you would like
to do it I think it would be great.

Hi Folks - I forgot one thing last night.  Our pizza was delivered by the owner of a new local pizza place and I promised him I'd give him feedback.
Since the pizza all got eaten I'm pretty sure I'm comfortable ordering from them again and will tell him so, but if you think that's a mistake please unicast me.
If there are any complaints, suggestions, or if you want to write a good review on Yelp etc to help these guys out here's the info:
Good Slice Pizza
2762 W 12600 S Riverton, UT 84065
(801) 878-4725

Thanks!
