Hi Dmitry,

I still don?t know where the meeting will be held tonight. Can you please clarify? I looked [1] and there is no location. I don?t know which LDS office in Riverton neither their address.

Hi George, Dimtry, do we have a go for next Thursday, the 5th of November?      I just taught an 8 hour version of our professional threat modeling course so I think I'm ready.  And as a bonus,  my employer (Cigital) will buy pizza for 20 or so (max $300).
Will this be at the LDS office in Riverton?   I haven't seen a schedule yet.
Please advise.  Thanks,

Hi George,

Our monthly meetings are combined with Utahsec. You can see the location/time @ http://www.utahsec.org/meeting-calendar. I try to also advertise them on this list, but I have been working through out Asia and missed advertising the last couple of meetings.
Thanks,

Dmitry

Hi,

I would like to attend that session but I haven?t attended any OWASP meetings so far so I am not familiar with where and when are the meetings. Can someone point me to that info or send me coordinates of meeting place + starting time?

Thanks for volunteering, David. That's a great topic. Let me see if we have a speaker for November lined up yet. Would next month first Thursday work for you?

Thanks,

Mobile Application Thread Modeling.

I've been doing this work, along with other developer and architect mentoring, for a couple of years now and I'd like to spread some best practices.  I believe I could offer a 90 minute session that could be useful to the team.
To sweeten the deal, my company (Cigital) would probably pay for pizza for 20 or so attendees.
What do you think?

All
I know I'm never around to come to the meetings , but i do appreciate all of this, and I read the stuff as it comes out . (Kids and work, you all know the story) I wish I could be more active in the community. I mean the only time I've seen Justin was wen I was at a SAns training in DC in June . 
I have invited my friend Chaz Boren to the group , please make him feel welcome , a sharp guy wanting to get back into security (and less management ) . 
I hope to see you guys at a meeting in the coming months .
