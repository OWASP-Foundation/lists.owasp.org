Security leaders, join us for a full American breakfast and learn how to give your developer team the ninja training and tools they need to fight off hackers and protect your business and your job.

Checkmarx is a static code analyzing tool that has figured out how to get people to actually change their behavior!  The team will be in town on the 22nd and will go over how they've done their "Codebashing" process at places like Salesforce, Microsoft, Fitbit, SAP!
