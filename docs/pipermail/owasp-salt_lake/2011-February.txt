The next OWASP Utah Chapter meeting is scheduled for Tuesday February 15th, 2011

Date:

February 15th, 2011


Time:

7 pm


Meeting location:

The Intermountain Healthcare's Lake Park facility

4646 West Lake Park Blvd.

Salt Lake City, Utah

(Inform security guard at the front desk that you are attending OWASP)


Presentation:

"Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with Samurai-WTF"

By Justin Searle


To get the most out of the training attendees need to:

1. Download the new version of Samurai-WTF 0.9

2. Be ready to run it for the meeting

There are three ways you can run it:

Run the ISO in a virtual machine, physically boot your laptops off a
burnt copy of the ISO, or install the ISO to a virtual machine hard
drive by clicking on the "ubiquity-gtkui" desktop icon.

Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings
