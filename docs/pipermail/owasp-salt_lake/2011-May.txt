Subject: [Owasp-salt_lake] Looking for Admin
Message-ID: <BANLkTimF4qaLsz4LfgJUei-410zRZvEq0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy,
I have accepted a security position with our corporate team in Olathe,
KS.  I am reaching out to the group to find an administrator who can
replace me.  I work for Utah Interactive and we manage the award
winning Utah.gov portal.  The job is primary *nix and java.  Lots of
web apps,   The admin would need to manage 3+ data centers, 5 major
networks, Cisco ASA's, VLANs, f5 load balancers and maintain SOX and
PCI compliance .

Job description:

http://www.ksl.com/jobs/listing/22115/14

Please pass this along to anyone who you think would be a good fit.
NIC (eGov) is the parent company and they are a great company to work
for.  www.egov.com Amazing business model, good pay and phenomenal
benefits.  They take good care of their employees and hire from
within.  Just Over half the states in the union work with NIC.  There
is a lot of room for growth or transitions to a new area if wanted.
Please have them contact me or reference me when applying or if they
have any questions.

Thanks,

Wayne Crowder

Subject: [Owasp-salt_lake] Advanced Persistent Threat talk at BYU
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=iY1C69Zre+HsNrwKFErmXcx6jSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Here is a nice presentation on Advanced Persistent Threat:
https://cs.byu.edu/colloquia/2011-03-08

Examples of APT are the stolen authentication code from Google in China,
and the RSA securID token secrets a couple months ago.

His most experience is with China and says they are years ahead.  But
that the majority of the attacks are combinations of well known
techniques:
- To get in the door:
  - Common web vulnerabilities such as SQL-injection
  - Targeted Spear-phishing to get in the door
    - look for the weak link - social engineering
      - Under-appreciated: CXO that is not the head-guy, but thinks he
should be.  Usually has admin creds
      - Job opportunities
      - Porn
- Viruses, backdoors, and malware that disables the AV.
- Obtain credentials, spread to as many systems as possible
- Encrypt, and hide the documents to steal.
- slowly leak documents off site, sent out on 443.

Notable quotes:
"There are groups that we've dealt with that are not sloppy, and they
will never get caught, because they are that good"

On Pen-testing: "Where the need exists today, is not for guys to be
penetration testers, thats a secondary attribute that we like, but what
we really like are defenders that know how to defend.  That's hard.  ...
STIGS, if you know how to configure a web server in accordance with a
STIG ...thats the guy that I'm going to pay the most money to.."

"Hackers are bored with our military, they got what they got...Their
biggest targets are intellectual property and research, which are
universities and corporations."
