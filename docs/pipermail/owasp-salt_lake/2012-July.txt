Sounds interesting to me. I haven't made it to many recent OWASP events, but would love to come participate/present. I could summarize my recent BH talk in 5 minutes for this.

Everyone, we have a UtahSec meeting scheduled for Thursday night this
week.  It will be a planning meeting for the next six months.  After
the planning session, we'll do a Learn-a-Tool night were we all pick a
tools and learn how to use it as a group.

    Date:  Thursday, August 2nd, 2012
    Time:  6:30pm - 8:30pm
    Organizer:  UtahSec Board
    Activity:  Bi-Annual Planninging and Learn-a-Tool Night
    Location:  1247 Midge Dr, Bluffdale, UT 84065  (Dial 039 at the
neighborhood gate so we can let you in)
    Food Sponsor:  None

We will also be officially welcoming DC801 (our local DefCon group)
into our UtahSec family.  Jeremy Pierson, the currently leader of
DC801, has agreed to merge DC801 into UtahSec, just like we have
merged in the local OWASP chapter and the Snort Users Group.  Jeremy
will be joining the UtahSec board to represent DC801's interests.

As for meeting location, since we failed to secure a location before
hand, we'll plan on doing it in my home office.  Besides, I need an
excuse to straight it up anyway.  ;-)

Everyone,

I really enjoyed meeting with you all over the past few years. I've moved
to Columbia, MD to fill a position with Sourcefire. Feel free to contact me
for anything about Sourcefire or its products (ClamAV, Snort, etc.). I'll
remain subscribed to this list since UtahSec and OWASP SLC are dear to my
heart. I'll be largely silent on the list.

I wish you all tremendous luck and success in your future endeavors. I look
forward to seeing the security community in Utah expand.

Thanks,

Shawn

Thanks Shawn.  We'll miss you.

BTW, I'll be presenting for the Charlottesville OWASP chapter on
Monday the 20th.  Thats about 3 hours drive south of you.  Feel free
to join us if you want want to.  I'll be driving back up to Crystal

Tuesday and Wednesday.

Everyone, update for Thursday night.  We are going to replace the
Learn-a-Tool session for a presentation by Seth Law from Fishnet.
Seth will be doing his presentation from Black Hat for us, on a tool
he developed called SiRA, Semi-Automated iOS Rapid Assessment.

If you didn't get a chance to go to Black Hat (or had to come home
early and miss the briefings even though you had a ticket - sad, I
know), make sure you come by Thursday night and get a taste of what
you missed.  We'll keep the planning session short to keep you from
getting board.  ;-)
