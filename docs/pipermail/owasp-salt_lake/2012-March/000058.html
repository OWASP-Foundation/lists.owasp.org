<PRE>Hey guys.  E-Trade just approached me to see if any of you would like
to do a 50 minute presentation for their employees as part of their
security awareness month.  I've done this before for them and it was a
good experience.  They usually do it lunch-and-learn style and make it
optional for their employees to attend.  Last time I did it we had
25-30 people there.  It was great fun and a good experience for those
of you looking to build you public speaking skills.  You'd be
presenting to non-security people, so you'd have to present it in a
non-techie way.  But that means that EVERY one of you have the
necessary skill sets to do this.  And you'll get free lunch out of it.
 ;-)

Any volunteers?  Details and dates below.  If you want to do it,
please email Catherine Staniforth and CC myself and Karen Gaignard.
All emails are below in the forward email headers.

Do it, I dare you!

Dear Mr. Searle,
Each September, E*Trade hosts an annual Security Awareness Month,
during which time we bring in a few guest speakers to each of our
facilities. This year both our sites in Sandy, UT and Jersey City, NJ,
have requested that, as an evolution to the Annual Security Awareness
Month, we bring in some speakers this spring.
So, I would like to find out if you could recommend someone who could
help me find one or more volunteers for Sandy and Jersey City? I am
very flexible with dates, and currently any Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday from 4/16 &#8211; 5/11 would be considered.
Speakers can certainly select their own topic based on their area of
expertise, etc., but the topic should be something that supports
information security in some way, shape, or form (information security
should be interpreted very broadly, to include fraud, privacy,
regulations, governance, etc.). A couple of examples might be
something to do with AML or Social Media.
Any advice or help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Cathie Staniforth
