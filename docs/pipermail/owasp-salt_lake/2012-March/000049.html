 Dear Cam Morris,

We're now live!!! Thank you all for your patience during these past couple
of weeks. The first week of lectures, slides, and problem sets are all
posted. The discussion forum is live. Please click here to get started:

<A HREF="http://crypto-class.org/">http://crypto-class.org/</A>

Even though you've already signed up, you need to register and choose a
password in the left side of the login box the first time you go to the
site.

The class will last for six weeks and officially starts on March 12. We
will be covering two topics per week. Each topic will consist of a series
of lectures with some embedded questions. There will be a weekly
programming assignment plus a weekly problem set. The first week's
assignments are posted and are due on March 26th.

I encourage you to participate in our online discussion forums by asking
and answering questions and discussing the material. We also welcome
feedback on the course and the assignments.

Please also forward this email to friends who might be interested in
learning about cryptography or who might just be interested in this new
form of online education. If you have friends taking the class, I strongly
encourage you to form a study group to discuss the material. You might even
find that it's more fun to watch the videos in a group.

Welcome again and I hope that you find this class stimulating and thought
provoking.

Dan Boneh
