Good afternoon,

Please let me know if next Thursday June 24th at 7 pm works for your
schedules for the June OWASP meeting in Draper. If I get enough people that
can attend we can solidify the date, but otherwise we can look at
alternative dates.

Also at our last meeting these individuals volunteered to briefly present on
the topics below. Please let me know if you are still willing to present.


   - PDF Attacks (Shawn Webb)
   - Drive-by Malware (Bo)
   - Source code review  (David Harvey)
   - Flash vulnerabilities and exploitation, including Flash decompiling
   (Scott Arveseth)
   - Samurai WTF (Justin Searle)


Thanks,


Dmitry Dessiatnikov
Utah OWASP Chapter Leader

I will be there. Unfortunately, I have not had time to look into PDF
attacks. Work picked up, including the addition of a second client.

I had very few responses but still willing to go ahead with the meeting
preparation unless I find out that an alternative date/time would draw a
bigger crowd.

At the last meeting we talked about changing the format of the meeting from
just having one person present to having everyone in attendance give a quick
5 minute report on a subject in the web application security they were
interested in/working on/learned anything new about. That way presenters
would not require extensive preparation and the meeting would flow better.
Would those that are planning to attend pick a topic and email it to me? And
if you would prefer not to present on anything please still come.
