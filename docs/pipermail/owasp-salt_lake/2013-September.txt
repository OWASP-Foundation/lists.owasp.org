We are going to experiment with broadcasting this with google hangout
"on-air"  I haven't yet discovered how to schedule an on-air hangout, so
I'll create it and email the links out to everyone ten minutes before we
start. There will be a hangout link so you can join us and ask questions
(no more than ten), or just a youtube link to watch us live.

I cropped the first thirty minutes of chit-chat and pizza eating.  The
volume is a bit low.  I need to speak up next time.  Here is the shorter
version:
