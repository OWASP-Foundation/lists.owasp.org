Y'all might want to stop by to see how attendance is.  From what I hear it is not unusual to have someone register and then not show up.

Odd.  Not sure why the said that on the twitter feed.  There was always
10-15 seats free.  Next time feel free to show up if you forget to
register.  Also, make sure you join the UtahSec mailing so you don't miss
the updates.  Details on UtahSec.org.
