Subject: [Owasp-salt_lake] Unofficial and Ad-Hoc UtahSec Meeting Thursday
	Night
Message-ID: <CAOL9KS+Bd6S-2+YDRLEYnS4Lnx50pUZDRxj2p1CT4w7dyBa=7g@mail.gmail.com>

Everybody, while we weren't able to have our official UtahSec / OWASP
meeting this Thursday do to the conflicts, I'll host an open hacking night
at my house this Thursday for anyone interested in coming.

Thursday night from 6pm-8pm I'll be sitting down to learn a new tool called
Raft.  This is a tool a friend of mine released at BlackHat last year.  It
is designed as an alternate for interception proxies.  You can best think
of it as a tool with all an interception proxies supplemental features, but
rather than intercepting traffic to manipulate, it has its own built in,
webkit based browser.  I've never used it, and its long past time that I
sit down and try it.

For those that are interested in joining me, plan on bringing your laptop
pre-installed with Ubuntu version 11.4, 11.10, or 11.4.  Since I've never
even installed it, from what I understand, these should work ..... I hope
.....  If not, we have two hours to figure it out and can as a last ditch
effort call Nathan Hamiel to harass him about it.

My house address is:

1247 Midge Dr
Bluffdale, UT  84065

Google should find it just fine and guide you there.  When you get to the
neighborhood gate, press "039" on the call box to have us open the gate for
you.  We are the corner house in the back of the neighborhood with the
large boulders in front and the driveway that connects to both streets.

Also, just so I know how many to expect, please reply to this email to let
me know if you'll be there.  I can handle as many as want to come, even if
we have to seize control of  the kitchen and living room.

I'll plan on coming. I'm going to be at the Utah Open Source Conference so
it's possible I might be late or have to cancel altogether. I'll keep you
informed.

Everybody, I apologize, however I won't be able to host the meeting
tonight.  My wife's sister passed away this morning in a car accident (the
one in Payson mentioned on KSL).  But please keep your schedule open for
the BBQ at my house next month.

Message-ID: <CAOL9KSJhExCXgorXKraVnhUK35+wD9kYKi-6iaHpmUHrUV03nA@mail.gmail.com>

Guys, thought I'd drop everyone a note about the Utah Cyber Defense
Challenge and Symposium happening on June 1st in Salt Lake.  We don't
get too many security conferences locally, so I thought it would be
good to shout it out.  Looks like its $50 to attend or $150 to
compete.  They have two competition divisions, college and
professional.  I'm wrapped up in family vacation that day or else I'd
consider putting together a team.  Let me know if any of you end up
competing.  I'm planning on being there for the kickoff in the
morning, so I'll give you a good send off if you do compete.

More info at:

https://www.fbcinc.com/e/ucdc/default.aspx

And don't forget the Family Social and BBQ at my house on June 7th at
7pm.  (Details at http://www.utahsec.org)

Two days ago John Fontana of ZDNet called and interviewed me about OWASP
Passfault.  He saw the blog post on owasp that Jim Manico put up for me,
http://owasp.blogspot.com/2012/05/for-better-password-policies-owasp.html

Yesterday he put out a great article explaining the tool and how the
password policy needs to change, not the user:
http://www.zdnet.com/blog/identity/your-passwords-dont-suck-its-your-policies/482

It made it on the front page marquee! Woot!  Other than just a few trolling
comments, the discussion on the article is great.

I owe a huge thank you to John Fontana, Jim Manico, Justin Searle, OWASP
Denver and OWASP Salt Lake, in helping spread the word.

Thanks!
