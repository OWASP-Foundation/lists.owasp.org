at 6:30 PM. It will be held at the following location:

Accuvant Offices
406 W South Jordan Pkwy, Suite 220
South Jordan, UT  84095
(It is easiest to park on the back side of the building and enter on the
2nd floor.  The office is just inside the main doors.)

Please RSVP so that we know how many people are able to attend to ensure we
have enough pizza.

Everyone is invited to attend.
