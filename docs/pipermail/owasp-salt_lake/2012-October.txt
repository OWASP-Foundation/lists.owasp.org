Everyone, don't forget about our UtahSec meeting at 6pm at the LDS
Riverton Office Building.  I'll be teaching another portion of my
Black Hat course on web pentesting with SamuraiWTF.  Download the
latest 2.0 ISO file at www.samurai-wtf.org and have it ready to go
before our meeting.

Details are at http://www.utahsec.org

Could one of you that work at the church confirm we still have a
meeting space for tomorrow night?

Everyone, don't forget about next week's UtahSec meeting.  DC801 will
be doing an introduction to Capture the Flag events, so don't forget
your laptop and your Backtrack virtual machine.  We'll be holding this
at Broadview University at 6pm.  Full details and address at:

http://www.utahsec.org

Unfortunately I won't be able to make the meeting this time (I'll be
in India), but have fun without me.  ;-)

I have updated the OWASP site to reflect the new address. Unfortunately I am out of town for the next two meetings (must be Q4), so thanks, Jeremy, for running the show next week.

Thanks,

Dmitry

Everyone, the UtahSec meeting location for this coming Thursday has
changed.  It will now be at:

440 s 700 e suite 102
SLC, 84102

I've updated the UtahSec.org website with that information and a link
to Google Maps.  For more information on the change, see Jeremy's
email below.

Justin,

Great timing.  We just signed the lease and we're excited to announce
that The Transistor and DC801 are opening our new SLC hacker space
11/1.  We'd like to move next weeks event to the new location at:

440 s 700 e suite 102
SLC, 84102

The space is a little bit larger than our digs at Broadview.

We'll be announcing a series of events shortly, but we'd like to kick
off the space with our Utahsec event next week.

If anyone has questions or concerns, throw me an email.  I look
forward to seeing everyone (who's isn't in India) next week!

Note from Danny about Thursday's night UtahSec meeting:

It might be beneficial to mention that you will want to park at the
Chili's parking lot as there is only 2 parking spots right in front of
the building that are designated specifically to us.

(board, please forward this to your group's email lists)
