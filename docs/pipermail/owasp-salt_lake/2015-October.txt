Subject: [Owasp-salt_lake] Possible presenter and topic for Application
	Threat Modeling
Message-ID: <CAJqstEQBvKKoQANWaARwfMXMdTsye2HK1JR0yZA40_JOi-QFgg@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to offer a topic and volunteer to present for an upcoming chapter
meeting:
Mobile Application Thread Modeling.

I've been doing this work, along with other developer and architect
mentoring, for a couple of years now and I'd like to spread some best
practices.  I believe I could offer a 90 minute session that could be
useful to the team.

To sweeten the deal, my company (Cigital) would probably pay for pizza for
20 or so attendees.

What do you think?

Thanks,

Thanks for volunteering, David. That's a great topic. Let me see if we have a speaker for November lined up yet. Would next month first Thursday work for you?

Thanks,

Dmitry

Hi Dmitry, That would be the 5th of November?  Yes, that should work.  Do
we still meet at the LDS office meeting in Riverton?
I'm going to try to get my employer (Cigital, Inc.) to sponsor pizza for
our meeting that evening.  Not sure yet if that's going to work.  I'm
thinking a 90 minute presentation on application threat modeling including
questions, would that be OK?.

Thanks,

Hi,

I would like to attend that session but I haven?t attended any OWASP meetings so far so I am not familiar with where and when are the meetings. Can someone point me to that info or send me coordinates of meeting place + starting time?

Hi George, 

Our monthly meetings are combined with Utahsec. You can see the location/time @ http://www.utahsec.org/meeting-calendar. I try to also advertise them on this list, but I have been working through out Asia and missed advertising the last couple of meetings.

Thanks,

Dmitry

Hi George, Dimtry, do we have a go for next Thursday, the 5th of
November?      I just taught an 8 hour version of our professional threat
modeling course so I think I'm ready.  And as a bonus,  my employer
(Cigital) will buy pizza for 20 or so (max $300).

Will this be at the LDS office in Riverton?   I haven't seen a schedule
yet.

Please advise.  Thanks,
