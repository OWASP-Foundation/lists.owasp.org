 Dear Cam Morris,

We're now live!!! Thank you all for your patience during these past couple
of weeks. The first week of lectures, slides, and problem sets are all
posted. The discussion forum is live. Please click here to get started:

http://crypto-class.org/

Even though you've already signed up, you need to register and choose a
password in the left side of the login box the first time you go to the
site.

The class will last for six weeks and officially starts on March 12. We
will be covering two topics per week. Each topic will consist of a series
of lectures with some embedded questions. There will be a weekly
programming assignment plus a weekly problem set. The first week's
assignments are posted and are due on March 26th.

I encourage you to participate in our online discussion forums by asking
and answering questions and discussing the material. We also welcome
feedback on the course and the assignments.

Please also forward this email to friends who might be interested in
learning about cryptography or who might just be interested in this new
form of online education. If you have friends taking the class, I strongly
encourage you to form a study group to discuss the material. You might even
find that it's more fun to watch the videos in a group.

Welcome again and I hope that you find this class stimulating and thought
provoking.

Dan Boneh

I won't be able to attend this month due to my wife having a tonsillectomy.

I do have news to report about the wargames we're planning on having
later on during the year. Roothack (roothack.org) would love to host
the games for us. The only thing the players will need is their own
laptop from which they can VPN into the games. I'll be working more
with ocyrus from roothack to coordinate and set up the games.

Do we want the wargames to be a full-day event?

Thanks,

Shawn

Hey Justin, I loved the last session.  I've never played around with the
sql tool before.  That was frighteningly fun!

On the website could you change the title to from passfill to passfault.
If you want to put a link there to passfault.com that would be great.

Have a great Friday!

Fellow chapter members.  I encourage you at attend if you can make it.
 This is looking to be a great regional OWASP conference that is
nearby.  Our local member Cameron Morris will be presenting at this
conference, and I'll be providing a 1-day training class there.  Sent
a shout out to the list if you are going so we can perhaps arrange a
time our chapter can meetup there.

Thanks Shawn.  I've added reference to roothack.org in the calendar.
As for making it a full day event, I'd suggest we run it as a 2 hour
night event as currently planned on Sept 6th.  If it goes well there,
we should consider doing it again at the OWASP day in November and run
it along side the presentations.

Hey guys.  E-Trade just approached me to see if any of you would like
to do a 50 minute presentation for their employees as part of their
security awareness month.  I've done this before for them and it was a
good experience.  They usually do it lunch-and-learn style and make it
optional for their employees to attend.  Last time I did it we had
25-30 people there.  It was great fun and a good experience for those
of you looking to build you public speaking skills.  You'd be
presenting to non-security people, so you'd have to present it in a
non-techie way.  But that means that EVERY one of you have the
necessary skill sets to do this.  And you'll get free lunch out of it.
 ;-)

Any volunteers?  Details and dates below.  If you want to do it,
please email Catherine Staniforth and CC myself and Karen Gaignard.
All emails are below in the forward email headers.

Do it, I dare you!

Dear Mr. Searle,
Each September, E*Trade hosts an annual Security Awareness Month,
during which time we bring in a few guest speakers to each of our
facilities. This year both our sites in Sandy, UT and Jersey City, NJ,
have requested that, as an evolution to the Annual Security Awareness
Month, we bring in some speakers this spring.
So, I would like to find out if you could recommend someone who could
help me find one or more volunteers for Sandy and Jersey City? I am
very flexible with dates, and currently any Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday from 4/16 ? 5/11 would be considered.
Speakers can certainly select their own topic based on their area of
expertise, etc., but the topic should be something that supports
information security in some way, shape, or form (information security
should be interpreted very broadly, to include fraud, privacy,
regulations, governance, etc.). A couple of examples might be
something to do with AML or Social Media.
Any advice or help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

It's a good conference and is very nice to have something local.


While on the top of local conferences...  I've been kicking around the idea
of Security B-Sides here in the Salt Lake area.  Would anyone be interested
in having such an event?

What would everyone think about UtahSec.org making our planned OWASP
day in November both a OWASP B-Sides?  Alternately we can do two
separate events and space them appart six months.  I like the idea of
merging since we could leverage both avenues for marketing for the
first event to make it as big as we can.  Another idea is to move it
to January the week before Sundance to tease people in hitting both
our event, Sundance, and the slopes.  ;-)

Thoughts?

I like the idea of combining--we might benefit in terms of participation... November would be better, I think.

Combining could work out well for all of the reasons stated.  There is
forensics conference in November that we might want to avoid scheduling
over.  PFIC runs Nov 3-7 this year.

I think there are merits to combining or keeping it separate - either way I
think it will be good to hold and the more people attend the better.  I
attended B-Sides PHX last month and they had two sessions of one hour each
going + a half day class + lock pick village - lots going on pretty much
all day.

Oct/Nov. would be fine - or I do like the idea of holding it later in the
winter - like on a Thursday or Friday to draw people in to ski/snowboard.

So far John and I are available Friday for lunch.  Can anyone else make
lunch that day?  Or should we try to get together another day?

I'm not able to make lunch next Friday.  In fact, next week is a wash for
me during the day.  I am available Tuesday, Thursday and Friday in the
evenings though.

I'm not able to make lunch next Friday.  In fact, next week is a wash for me during the day.  I am available Tuesday, Thursday and Friday in the evenings though.

I attended B-Sides PHX last month and they had two sessions of one hour each going + a half day class + lock pick village - lots going on pretty much all day.

Oct/Nov. would be fine - or I do like the idea of holding it later in the winter - like on a Thursday or Friday to draw people in to ski/snowboard.

So far John and I are available Friday for lunch.  Can anyone else make lunch that day?  Or should we try to get together another day?

What would everyone think about UtahSec.org making our planned OWASP day in November both a OWASP B-Sides?  Alternately we can do two separate events and space them appart six months.  I like the idea of merging since we could leverage both avenues for marketing for the first event to make it as big as we can.  Another idea is to move it to January the week before Sundance to tease people in hitting both our event, Sundance, and the slopes.  ;-)

Thoughts?

Evenings would work best for me since I'm in Ogden. Thursday evening
would work for me as well.
