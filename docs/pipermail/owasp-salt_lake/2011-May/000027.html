<PRE>Here is a nice presentation on Advanced Persistent Threat:
<A HREF="https://cs.byu.edu/colloquia/2011-03-08">https://cs.byu.edu/colloquia/2011-03-08</A>

Examples of APT are the stolen authentication code from Google in China,
and the RSA securID token secrets a couple months ago.

His most experience is with China and says they are years ahead.  But
that the majority of the attacks are combinations of well known
techniques:
- To get in the door:
  - Common web vulnerabilities such as SQL-injection
  - Targeted Spear-phishing to get in the door
    - look for the weak link - social engineering
      - Under-appreciated: CXO that is not the head-guy, but thinks he
should be.  Usually has admin creds
      - Job opportunities
      - Porn
- Viruses, backdoors, and malware that disables the AV.
- Obtain credentials, spread to as many systems as possible
- Encrypt, and hide the documents to steal.
- slowly leak documents off site, sent out on 443.

Notable quotes:
&quot;There are groups that we've dealt with that are not sloppy, and they
will never get caught, because they are that good&quot;

On Pen-testing: &quot;Where the need exists today, is not for guys to be
penetration testers, thats a secondary attribute that we like, but what
we really like are defenders that know how to defend.  That's hard.  ...
STIGS, if you know how to configure a web server in accordance with a
STIG ...thats the guy that I'm going to pay the most money to..&quot;

&quot;Hackers are bored with our military, they got what they got...Their
biggest targets are intellectual property and research, which are
universities and corporations.&quot;
