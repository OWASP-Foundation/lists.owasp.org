<PRE>OWASP Salt Lake,

For our meeting this month we will hear from Cameron Morris on OAuth and Open-ID-Connect. As usual this is in conjunction with UtahSec so the meeting will be conducted by one of the UtahSec Board Members. Details below:

Date:

May 7th, 2015

Time:

6 - 8 pm

Meeting location:

LDS Riverton Office Building

3740 W 13400 S

Riverton, UT 84065

(Inform security guard at the front desk that you are attending OWASP)

Agenda: &quot;OAuth and Open-ID-Connect&quot; presentation by Cameron Morris.

Abstract: In 2014 Eran Hammer removed himself from the OAuth 2.0 spec that he helped create. He complained that the simple protocol had been converted into complex framework that will likely lead to security vulnerabilities. Despite his warning, the industry has marched forward with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID-Connect. In this discussion we'll dissect OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect enough help expose some common pitfalls and what to look for in a flawed implementation.

Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings

Thanks,

Dmitry
