"Mobile Application and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Security"
By Dmitry Dessiatnikov, Security Aim
Food Sponsor: TBA
Abstract:
The explosion of the mobile application market coupled with acceptance of
"bring your own device" (BYOD) to enterprise environments comes with its
unique security risks. While driven by a rise in productivity, convenience
and overall user satisfaction BYOD increases the attack surface that most
businesses are not prepared for. In this presentation we will cover the
reasons for concern along with a demonstration of a remote compromise of an
Android phone in a corporate environment. We will also discuss the OWASP top
10 mobile risks and demonstrate some common issues with a vulnerable iOS
mobile application. A free tool will be shared with the audience that can
assist with assessing their corporate BYOD environments. Finally, we will
cover some mitigating controls and what can be done to address raised
issues.
Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings

Best regards,

Dmitry Dessiatnikov
