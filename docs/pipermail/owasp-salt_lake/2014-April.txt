Board, please forward to your respective group lists.

Everyone, don't forget we are doing a barbecue at my house tomorrow at 6pm.
Spouse and children are welcome!  I'll be providing hamburgers, hotdogs, and
vegiburgers for everyone.  Please plan on bringing something to share with
everyone in good old potluck style.

My address is:

1247 Midge Drive
Bluffdale, UT 84065

Google maps pulls the address up correctly.  If the neighborhood gates are
shut, dial 039 at the gate so I can open them.
