Subject: [Owasp-salt_lake] SANS Web App Pen Testing course coming to Utah
Message-ID: <D0E82227.98A1%dd@securityaim.com>

OWASP Salt Lake,

Don?t have a budget to travel to a large SANS conference? SANS is bringing
SEC 542 Web Application Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking course to
our community so that you can attend the 6 day course during the day and
still come back to your family in the evenings. Early bird registration
discounts are available.

I will be teaching the course April 13-18, 2015 at Double Tree Suites by
Hilton Hotel Salt Lake City
<http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/utah/doubletree-suites-by-hilton-ho
tel-salt-lake-city-SLCWSDT/index.html>  details at:
http://www.sans.org/community/event/sec542-salt-lake-city-13apr2015-dmitry-d
essiatnikov

But if you want to get out of town for training, I will also be teaching it
next month in Seattle:
http://www.sans.org/community/event/sec542-seattle-02feb2015-dmitry-dessiatn
ikov

Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Thanks,

Dmitry
