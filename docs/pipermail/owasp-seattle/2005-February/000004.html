<PRE>OWASP-Seattle,

Welcome new members!  I want to thank all of you for your response.  Member
sign-up has been very high so far and I look forward to meeting with you at
the initial meeting March 2nd at the Sheraton Bellevue hotel.

To our app security specialist members, I'd like to ask two of you to
volunteer for a brief 20-30 minute presentation on web application testing
techniques. The thought is to have hands-on demonstrations of one or two of
the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and methods to test for them. Or perhaps a
demonstration by someone who is using the WebScarab tool or WebGoat testing
application.

Current agenda:

6pm - 6:30pm  	Arrival, chit/chat &amp; intro to OWASP-Seattle
6:30pm - 7pm 	Presentation: OWASP influence at Concur Technologies
			Presenter: Jeff Miller, Security Specialist, Concur Technologies
7pm - 7:30pm	Presentation TBD
7:30pm - 8pm	Presentation TBD
8pm - 8:30pm	Wrap-up and Q&amp;A regarding future agendas/events


To appeal to both our crack app security experts and those in web
development with limited security knowledge, the goal is to have a mix of
case studies that demonstrate app security best practices and processes at
local companies along with demonstrations of web hacking techniques. Any
suggestions prior to the meeting are certainly welcome.
