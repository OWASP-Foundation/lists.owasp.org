<PRE>I am pleased to announce we have Scott Stender of iSec Partners speaking
at our upcoming Thursday night OWASP meeting. The presentation topic is
Web Services Security. Scott will discuss how deploying a web
services-based architecture introduces a number of attack services that
need to be well understood and protected against misuse.

As we are having food and beverages served, please RSVP so I can give an
accurate count to the restaurant catering. The info below will be updated
on the OWASP Seattle web site this evening.
