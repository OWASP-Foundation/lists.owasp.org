Message-ID: <4B0D92B2.5070100@fhcrc.org>

Hi folks,

We're hosting Garth Brown of Semaphore and Matt Sommer of Google for a public
seminar on the 'Morphing Landscape of IT Security'.  Matt is lead security 
analyst for Google -- spends his days managing penetration testing and security 
assessments.

A couple of smart guys, long-time buds, wanting to contribute some of what
they've been learning to the community.

Forward as widely as you see fit.
