<PRE>Hello Fellow Seattle OWASPers!

Here is the speaker line-up for the next OWASP meeting on February 3rd.  The presentations will start around 6:30 and we will try and get some grub and drinks in there a little before then.  If you could let me know if you plan on attending so I can order enough food I would appreciate it.

Location: Bellevue Las Margaritas
437 108th Ave NE
Bellevue, WA 98004
(425) 453-0535
Date: 2/3/2010 @ 6:30ish

Speakers:


Speaker: Hidetake Jo
Same Origin Policy
Same origin policy is a simple and important security policy which protects millions of users on the web. Often times the policy is over simplified and there is a misconception that there is one consistent policy being used across all web technologies. Unfortunately this can&#8217;t be further from the truth. Different browser brands, RIA plugins, various scripting languages and features within the browser environment have their own interpretation of the same origin policy. Not understanding the subtle differences can be catastrophic to web security. This presentation tries to summarize the deltas in the same origin policy. This is also a call for action to involve the community to more comprehensively document the policies.

Hidetake Jo is part of the Trustworthy Computing team in Office. He works with teams throughout Office to identify threats and ways to mitigate those threats, he also gets to break stuff. Hidetake has written many penatration testing tools that are used throughout Microsoft.


Speaker: Pravir Chandra
Open Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM)
The Open Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) (<A HREF="http://www.opensamm.org/">http://www.opensamm.org/</A>) is a flexible and prescriptive framework for building security into a software development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based models for security, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their security assurance program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned to the specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure software development throughout the typical governance, development, and deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable management within an organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through iterations of building a security assurance program. This workshop will introduce the SAMM framework and walk through useful activities such as assessing an assurance program, mapping an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowing, additional case studies will also be discussed. OpenSAMM is an open a free project and has recently been donated to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation. For more information on OpenSAMM, visit <A HREF="http://www.opensamm.org/.">http://www.opensamm.org/.</A>

Pravir Chandra is Director of Strategic Services at Fortify Software and works with clients on software security assurance programs. Pravir is recognized for his expertise in software security, code analysis, and his ability to strategically apply technical knowledge. Prior to Fortify, he was a Principal Consultant affiliated with Cigital and led large software security programs at Fortune 500 companies.

He recently created and led the Open Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM) project with the OWASP Foundation, leads the OWASP CLASP project, and also serves as member of the OWASP Global Projects Committee.

I look forward to seeing everyone there!

Thanks,
