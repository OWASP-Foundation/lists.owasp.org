Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] OWASP meeting Dec 14th

Due to a trade show in New York I must attend on Dec 7-8, the next OWASP
Seattle meeting has been moved to Wednesday Dec 14th. The website has
been updated with the presentation lineup.
http://www.owasp.org/local/seattle.html

We have two excellent presentations scheduled that should appeal to both
application security testers and web developers: 'Cross-Site Forgery
Reference' and 'Improving the Secure Software Development Lifecycle'.
Both speakers are former @Stake guys with years of app security testing
experience.

As part of the holiday spirit, there will be an iPod Shuffle given away
as a door prize so bring your business card for the fish bowl.  Those
who already have an iPod can use the receipt to exchange it for another
gadget.

If you are attending the next meeting, please RSVP so I can get an
accurate count for food and drinks.

-Todd

Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] Tonight's Meeting Cancelled
Message-ID: <4478.67.170.35.253.1134582504.squirrel@webmail.owasp.org>

The OWASP meeting tonight has been cancelled due to a limited number of
RSVPs received.

I was concerned about having a meeting in mid-December which is usually
not a good idea as there are company and family events competing for
evening schedules.

We will move this meeting to the 2nd or 3rd week of January and it will
include the following presentations:

* XPath and XQuery Injection
* Improving the Secure Software Development Lifecycle

Best holiday wishes to all members and we'll see you after the New Year.
