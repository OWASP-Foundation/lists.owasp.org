<PRE>Hello Seattle OWASP Chapter!

Mike and I have invited two great speakers to present at our January OWASP Seattle Chapter Meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, January 23.  As usual, we will be meeting at Las Margaritas in Bellevue.  Please let me know if you plan on attending so we can make sure to have enough food and frosty beverages.  Complete details are below:

OWASP Seattle Chapter Meeting
January 23, 2008 @ 6:30PM PST

437 108th Ave NE
Bellevue, WA  98004

Emerging threats in Web 2.0
Waqas Nazir - V-Empower

Web 2.0 applications provide many rich features today such as hosting third party RSS Feeds, hosting third party web pages, translation services, and cross domain communication. While these rich features provide great functionality to end users, they can have serious security implications if not designed properly. Moreover, implementation flaws plague many of these features. This presentation will focus on some new emerging threats to Web 2.0 applications from a design and implementation perspective, leaving out the often covered Web 2.0 Vulnerabilities (Ajax, XSRF, etc).

Waqas Nazir has been working as an Information Security Consultant for clients such as Microsoft where he has delivered services in various arenas of information security. These include code reviews, black box assessments, product reviews, custom tools development for complex security problems, policy and process development. He has also worked with Microsoft Research (MSR) to develop a code analysis tool used for identifying areas of vulnerabilities in code. He has also been featured in Microsoft's Information Security Newsletter.

Ruby on Rails Security
Chris Clark - iSEC Partners

Ruby on Rails has been hailed for its ability to increase developer productivity by making web development easier.  Though Ruby on Rails may help developers create sites more quickly, it is no more immune to security threats than other web development frameworks.  Chris Clark will present the means by which the OWASP Top Ten manifest themselves in a Ruby on Rails environment, provide best practices for preventing these attacks, and discuss his ongoing research in Ruby-specific security concerns.

Chris Clark is a Senior Security Consultant at iSEC Partners, Inc. He possesses several years of experience in secure application design, penetration testing, and security process management. Most recently Chris worked for Microsoft performing security analysis and verification on enterprise management software and was previously responsible for the security of a web-based payment platform processing over 20 million credit card transactions per day. Chris has extensive experience in developing and delivering security trainings for large organizations, software engineering utilizing Win32 and the .Net Framework, and analyzing threats to large scale distributed systems. At Microsoft, Chris was responsible for the coordination of multiple product groups following the Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle.

Thanks, we look forward to seeing you on Wednesday!

- Scott and Mike
