Presentations:

When Tools Are Not Enough &#8211; Best Practices for Securing Web Applications
Speakers: Walter Pearce &amp; Wade Winright from IOActive

The demands of regulatory compliance may have you looking to vulnerability scanning tools in the hopes of finding a silver bullet to examine your web applications. However, it is not realistic to expect scanners alone to accurately determine the impact of the web application vulnerabilities they detect. In this presentation, Walter Pearce and Wade Winright will discuss best practices for securing web applications, including how to effectively utilize tools in conjunction with penetration testing.

Walter Pearce is a Senior Security Consultant at IOActive, experienced in enterprise-level application assessment and consultation. At IOActive he performs penetration testing, identifies system vulnerabilities, and designs custom security solutions for clients in software development, telecommunications, financial services, and professional services. Pearce has performed security assessments and IT security support services for many companies in the Fortune 100, including involvement in the largest existing penetration test of a major educational institution. He regularly leads IOActive training courses on numerous topics that include web application security, secure coding in C# or C++, and threat modeling.

Wade Winright is a Security Consultant at IOActive, experienced in security testing, and network and systems installation and configuration. At IOActive he performs vulnerability and enterprise risk assessments of application, systems, and infrastructure, and designs custom security solutions for clients in software development, telecommunications, financial services, and professional services.
Winright is a SANS GIAC Certified Incident Handler with a focus on incident handling and hacker tools/techniques, and also is certified by the E-Commerce Council CEH, focused on vulnerability/penetration testing and countermeasures.


Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors:
How to Secure Your Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors &amp; Data
Speaker: Clint Pollock from Veracode

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and security of the software running its business critical applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers. Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third party developers or are developing a COTS application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and make applications security a priority for internal and external development teams. In this session we will cover;
Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks
Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your applications
Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities

Clint Pollock is a Senior Solutions Architect at Veracode. Since 1997, he has also created security solutions for large-scale enterprise environments on behalf of CREDANT Technologies and Netegrity. In his current role, Clint helps globally distributed organizations evaluate, track, and mitigate their online business risk. Clint's greatest strengths are his enthusiasm, experience and determination to help customers succeed in maintaining secure, compliant systems, and avoid the consequences and bad headlines that come with application security breaches. Clint resides in Chicago, IL.

Thanks,
Mike de Libero &amp; Scott Stender
