Hi All,

I am Dharmesh Mehta presently working with Majesco in Microsoft under

I am new to Seattle, but not new to OWASP. I am an active member of Mumbai

I would like to meet you all at the January Monthly Meet.

OWASP members,

The next OWASP Seattle meeting will be held Wednesday night January 25th
at the usual spot, Las Margaritas, in downtown Bellevue.

We have two excellent presentations scheduled that should appeal to both
application security testers and web developers: 'Cross-Site Forgery
Reference' and 'Improving the Secure Software Development Lifecycle'. Both
speakers are former @Stake guys with years of app security testing
experience.

There will be an iPod Shuffle given away as a door prize so bring your
business card for the fish bowl.  Those who already have an iPod can use
the receipt to exchange it for another gadget.

We have several new members who have just signed up, so I'm looking
forward to meeting all who are attending their first meeting. Please RSVP
so I can get an accurate count for food and drinks. If you are bringing a
co-worker, just let me know when you RSVP.

See you next week!

-Todd

Hello all,

My name is Greg Rubin and I'm a (relatively) recent hire at Amazon.com as well as being a sysadmin for NationStates.net.  As you might imagine, web application security is very important for me, so I thought that I would join this group to learn more about it.  (That and the topics of information security have always interested me).

Greg
