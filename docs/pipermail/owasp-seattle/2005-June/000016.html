<PRE>Did you want me to present anything on XML firewalls as web services and
web services security policy enforcement points, although it may overlap
with Netcontinuum so I suspect you have it covered. I'm not particularly
eager BTW.. Regardless I should be coming.

Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] Panel speakers for Thur night

I am very pleased with the lineup we have for the application firewall
panel at Thursday night's meeting. This group offers a background of
experience in implementing and tuning app firewall technologies. Bios
for the panel are listed below and will be updated on the chapter Web
site later today.

OWASP Seattle member information is never shared with our sponsors and
guest speakers, so if you have questions after the panel discussion
concludes please bring a business card.

-Todd


Feature Presentation: Application Firewall Panel Featured Speakers: Kurt
Roemer, CTO at NetContinuum; Mark Kraynak, Director of Product Marketing
at Imperva; Patrick Wolf, Product Manager for F5's TrafficShield.

-----------------------------------------
Patrick Wolf is the Product Manager for F5's TrafficShield. Patrick
spent
3 years with Sanctum, a pioneer in the Web Application security market,
and has over 5 years experience working with application firewall
technologies and performing security testing on Web applications.

Mark Kraynak is the Director of Product Marketing at Imperva. Before
joining Imperva, Mr. Kraynak managed the product marketing team for
Check Point Software Technologies. Prior to that, he held marketing and
consulting positions at CacheFlow (now BlueCoat Systems) and Ernst &amp;

information security expert on the Fox News Channel. In addition, Kurt
serves as a board member for several security interests, including the
ISSA's Generally Accepted Information Security Principles project
served, and was Vice President of the SE Wisconsin Project Management
Institute.

-----------------------------------------
What are application firewalls, where in the application infrastructure
are they placed, and do they work? And will a traditional Web
application firewall protect XML-enabled applications? There will be a
Q&amp;A session so you can ask questions about the technologies in an open
forum. The panel focus will be on technical features and implementation.

Information provided at chapter meetings is in the interest of the
members of the OWASP Seattle chapter.
