Subject: [Owasp-seattle] Get started on a side project or company

Hey there,

I know a lot of you have already started a side-project or company and a
lot of you want to. Wanted to share about FounderDating (no, it's not
romantic) since I know finding the right person can be a big challenge. FD
is an invite-only, online network for entrepreneurs to start side projects
& to connect with cofounders. I see some of you are already on but let's
get more Seattle folks!

Some highlights of the network:

1) High caliber people - everyone is referenced/screened

2) 50% engineers

3) Reach - the network spans N.America, UK, Israel

The Seattle deadline is 9/19. Apply now (you don't need an idea) >
