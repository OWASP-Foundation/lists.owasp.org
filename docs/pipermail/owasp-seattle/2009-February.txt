Hi All,
       'have put up a basic site/structured-wiki, http://sites.google.com/site/solsops/ , for all, to post Open Problems in Security. Creative minds can offer leads to solutions.
Well, it would be great to have all of us contribute/collaborate actively to this wiki/site. There is a need for all the info/web security crusaders to first identify ''Open Problems'', even before coming up with solutions. :)

Interested Cool-minded keepers of security, can send in their gmail IDs, in order to get invited.


1) This site allows everyone to get in sync with the Open Problems and possible solutions.
2) It allows Security evangelists, Public Policy makers, Non-profit Orgs., Security researchers and many more(assuming they would be interested and would have a gmail ID) to document the current burning issues that we face while operating in today's insecure infoways.

Kindly let me know your thoughts and info on anything similar already in place.[In our case, we get our own pages to design for problems and solutions.]

Maybe we can add it as part of OWASP, if this catches on.

regards and thanks
sk
