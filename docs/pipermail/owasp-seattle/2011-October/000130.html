<PRE>Hello, 

I am the new OWASP Seattle Chapter leader and will be working hard to build an vibrant local software security community with you in the coming months. I  started OWASP back in 2001 and recently did the keynote at AppSec USA so have a long history and deep connection with the project. There are many  of the worlds great tech giants, a thriving start-up scene and significant e-commerce happening in our city and so I am excited to have an opportunity to curate some great talks on some great topics and have some fun on the way. Other OWASP chapters have regular meetings, work on projects together and even put on day long speaking and training events. If there is enough interest we can look at similar events in Seattle in the new year but initially I am hoping to host bi-monthly meetings and will be queuing up talks based on feedback from you. 

I have asked Bryan Sullivan to come in November and deliver his important talk on Server Side JavaScript and NoSQL security issues and he has graciously agreed. He first delivered this talk at Black Hat in Vegas this summer. The topics are critical to the emerging web stack and Bryan is a great speaker so expect no fluff, straight talk and great demos!

I am working with KPMG to secure a venue and date in downtown Seattle in November and need your help in provisional planning. We have a few potential choices for dates and I would like to get an approximate RSVP to decide which date is best. Please let me know (via reply all and an intro to the list) or a reply privately to me if you are interested in attending and if so which date would work best.

Downtown - 6pm to 8pm

Option 1 - Weds November 9th
Option 2 - Weds November 16th

At the first meeting well prioritize future talks, dates and locations!

Thanks!

Mark
