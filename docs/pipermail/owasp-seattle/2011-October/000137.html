<PRE>I am delighted to announce that we have Eve Maler (<A HREF="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/">http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/</A>) coming to talk about Online Identity and the Future of SAML for the OWASP December meeting. The meeting will be held on Dec 14th at 6-30pm at Googles Freemont office (sorry we had to tweak the date and time a little). 

<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-OWASP-Chapter/events/37453002/">http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-OWASP-Chapter/events/37453002/</A>

Please RSVP using the MeetUp link above. 

Eve Maler is a principal analyst serving Security &amp; Risk Professionals. She is an expert on emerging identity and security solutions, identity federation, consumer-facing identity and web access management, distributed authorization, privacy enhancement, and web services security. Eve helps clients manage risk and utilize business opportunities through identity and access management business and technology strategy. She is based in the Seattle area.

PREVIOUS WORK EXPERIENCE
Prior to joining Forrester, Eve was an identity solutions architect with PayPal, developing business and technical strategies for new consumer identity services offerings. Previously, Eve managed Sun Microsystems' technical collaborations with Microsoft on web services and federated identity interoperability, and she made major leadership, technical, and education contributions to the development of the SAML standard for federated identity.

See you there! Perhaps some Christmas drinks in a Freemont pub afterwards!

Note : I am working on increasing the capacity for the November meeting as we will rapidly run out of seats. RSVP early for both events!
