How can I contact Cyrus Gray ? I Managed to make contact with Mike and Scott and asked to take over Chapter Leadership role as things seem to have become stagnant with Mike moving to Texas. I know there is some solid interest in Seattle so its time to whip up some activity. 

If I haven't heard from Cyrus with objections by Weds I am going to mount a hostile takeover ;-)

Anyone interested in hosting or sponsoring the next meeting in November in downtown Seattle?

Hello, 

I am the new OWASP Seattle Chapter leader and will be working hard to build an vibrant local software security community with you in the coming months. I  started OWASP back in 2001 and recently did the keynote at AppSec USA so have a long history and deep connection with the project. There are many  of the worlds great tech giants, a thriving start-up scene and significant e-commerce happening in our city and so I am excited to have an opportunity to curate some great talks on some great topics and have some fun on the way. Other OWASP chapters have regular meetings, work on projects together and even put on day long speaking and training events. If there is enough interest we can look at similar events in Seattle in the new year but initially I am hoping to host bi-monthly meetings and will be queuing up talks based on feedback from you. 

I have asked Bryan Sullivan to come in November and deliver his important talk on Server Side JavaScript and NoSQL security issues and he has graciously agreed. He first delivered this talk at Black Hat in Vegas this summer. The topics are critical to the emerging web stack and Bryan is a great speaker so expect no fluff, straight talk and great demos!

I am working with KPMG to secure a venue and date in downtown Seattle in November and need your help in provisional planning. We have a few potential choices for dates and I would like to get an approximate RSVP to decide which date is best. Please let me know (via reply all and an intro to the list) or a reply privately to me if you are interested in attending and if so which date would work best.

Downtown - 6pm to 8pm

Option 1 - Weds November 9th
Option 2 - Weds November 16th

At the first meeting well prioritize future talks, dates and locations!

Thanks!

Mark

Hi Mark,

Glad to see this is starting up, and I'm very interested in attending.  Are
Nov. 9th and 16th the only options?  Those dates/times both conflict with
Puget Sound ISACA Chapter CISA Review sessions to be held at the KPMG
offices.

Thanks for taking the time to kick this into gear!

Hi folks, a quick update on progress towards getting the OWASP Seattle Chapter a vibrant local software security community. 

There has been a great response and over 20 people have mailed directly to say they want to attend the first meeting. I have had offers for hosting the first event from KPMG and Google (and a few other options as potentials) so I am hopeful we can get regular meetings at great locations. 

I am working with KPMG to lock on the date and location and with our first speaker(s). At the first event we can do a poll for future topics, speakers. 

Look for an update with a date, location and topics sometime next week. 

Cheers!

Mark

Message-ID: <11E401BF-B40C-41F8-A55A-C2B385DA460B@curphey.com>

Hi folks,

I have just setup the November OWASP Seattle Chapter meeting and look forward to some great talks and meeting some great people (and a few beers along the way). I am afraid I needed to move the date to November 17th to accommodate the venue. Thank you to KPMG for agreeing to host this first meeting. 

Talk : Bryan Sullivan "NoSQL but even less security" 

Look for an updated version of the talk he gave at BlackHat this year with lots of eye-popping demos. 

The location and an RSVP can be found at the Meetup page I created here 

http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-OWASP-Chapter/events/37444702/#

Please take time to RSVP so we can estimate numbers. 

I am already working on a December meeting which well hold at Googles offices in Freemont (target date of Dec 15th) and have invited a stellar identity speaker! 

Cheers!

Mark

I am delighted to announce that we have Eve Maler (http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/) coming to talk about Online Identity and the Future of SAML for the OWASP December meeting. The meeting will be held on Dec 14th at 6-30pm at Googles Freemont office (sorry we had to tweak the date and time a little). 

http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-OWASP-Chapter/events/37453002/

Please RSVP using the MeetUp link above. 

Eve Maler is a principal analyst serving Security & Risk Professionals. She is an expert on emerging identity and security solutions, identity federation, consumer-facing identity and web access management, distributed authorization, privacy enhancement, and web services security. Eve helps clients manage risk and utilize business opportunities through identity and access management business and technology strategy. She is based in the Seattle area.

PREVIOUS WORK EXPERIENCE
Prior to joining Forrester, Eve was an identity solutions architect with PayPal, developing business and technical strategies for new consumer identity services offerings. Previously, Eve managed Sun Microsystems' technical collaborations with Microsoft on web services and federated identity interoperability, and she made major leadership, technical, and education contributions to the development of the SAML standard for federated identity.

See you there! Perhaps some Christmas drinks in a Freemont pub afterwards!

Note : I am working on increasing the capacity for the November meeting as we will rapidly run out of seats. RSVP early for both events!

Message-ID: <FBC65F8C-1559-4AB1-A284-6927397D7CC6@curphey.com>

Hi,

We have had a great response to the first meeting and we are now at 50 RSVP's with a room that can accommodate 45 people! From past experience around 50% of those that RSVP actually turn up to free meetings, so I would ask that if you want to attend any meeting please go ahead and RSVP and as long as you are within the first 100 registered you will get a seat. I have turned the auto-wait list feature on at Meetup.com which is a rolling waiting list (first come, first seated). This will ensure that those that register first will get priority. No one will be turned away but it may well be standing room only !

It's also worth registering now for the December event which is also posted.
