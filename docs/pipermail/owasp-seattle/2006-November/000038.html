<PRE>Hello,

Well this email is a little bit later than &quot;right after the meeting&quot; but
we are finally sending it dang it!  :) 

Here are a few thoughts that we (Mike and Scott) have had about the
OWASP Seattle chapter and we would like your feedback.

- Take on one OWASP Project (like finishing the vulnerabilities area of
OWASP).
- Audit an Open Source project and report the findings
- Test an OWASP program and help further the quality of it
- Do we like the meeting place to be Bellevue or would a different area
be better? Should we stay on the Eastside? Go to Downtown Seattle? 
Go up North? Go down South (No, not Mexico)? Does anyone have a
preference?
- What would you like for the chapter to do / focus on? More research?
More OWASP related things? Honing skills?

Please let us know your thoughts and we are looking forward to your
feedback.

We are working on the next meeting and will be announcing details as we
get them.

Thanks,
Mike &amp; Scott

</PRE>
