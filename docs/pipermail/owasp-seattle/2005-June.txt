Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] Panel speakers for Thur night
Message-ID: <1279.24.16.205.170.1118158492.squirrel@webmail.owasp.org>

I am very pleased with the lineup we have for the application firewall
panel at Thursday night's meeting. This group offers a background of
experience in implementing and tuning app firewall technologies. Bios for
the panel are listed below and will be updated on the chapter Web site
later today.

OWASP Seattle member information is never shared with our sponsors and
guest speakers, so if you have questions after the panel discussion
concludes please bring a business card.

-Todd


Feature Presentation: Application Firewall Panel
Featured Speakers: Kurt Roemer, CTO at NetContinuum; Mark Kraynak,
Director of Product Marketing at Imperva; Patrick Wolf, Product Manager
for F5's TrafficShield.

-----------------------------------------
Patrick Wolf is the Product Manager for F5's TrafficShield. Patrick spent
3 years with Sanctum, a pioneer in the Web Application security market,
and has over 5 years experience working with application firewall
technologies and performing security testing on Web applications.

Mark Kraynak is the Director of Product Marketing at Imperva. Before
joining Imperva, Mr. Kraynak managed the product marketing team for Check
Point Software Technologies. Prior to that, he held marketing and
consulting positions at CacheFlow (now BlueCoat Systems) and Ernst &
Young's Center for Technology Enablement. Mr. Kraynak holds a bachelor's
degree in Electrical Engineering and English from Duke University and an
MFA in Poetry from American University.

Kurt Roemer, CISSP, is Chief Technology Officer at NetContinuum. Kurt has
more than 16 years experience in the security, networking and Web services
infrastructure markets through Micron Electronics, NetFRAME, Hewitt,
Searle/Monsanto and private consulting work. He has designed, implemented,
and assessed network, Web services, and information security solutions and
policies for Fortune 1000, mid-size, and government organizations. Kurt

globe and has appeared as an information security expert on the Fox News
Channel. In addition, Kurt serves as a board member for several security
interests, including the ISSA's Generally Accepted Information Security
Principles project served, and was Vice President of the SE Wisconsin
Project Management Institute.

-----------------------------------------
What are application firewalls, where in the application infrastructure
are they placed, and do they work? And will a traditional Web application
firewall protect XML-enabled applications? There will be a Q&A session so
you can ask questions about the technologies in an open forum. The panel
focus will be on technical features and implementation.

provided at chapter meetings is in the interest of the members of the
OWASP Seattle chapter.

Did you want me to present anything on XML firewalls as web services and
web services security policy enforcement points, although it may overlap
with Netcontinuum so I suspect you have it covered. I'm not particularly
eager BTW.. Regardless I should be coming.
