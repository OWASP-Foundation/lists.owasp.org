<PRE>I'm pleased to announce our December meeting.

<A HREF="https://twitter.com/owaspseattle/status/805189363650789376">https://twitter.com/owaspseattle/status/805189363650789376</A>

The event will be at Facebook&#8217;s Seattle office at Dexter Station, 1101
Dexter Ave. They provided this advice for the venue:

Facebook is all about scale, and single occupant cars don&#8217;t scale.  We are
located in a dense and busy neighborhood and parking is not available on
site.  Please try to use public transportation, carpool, Uber/taxi or
bicycle.  The event will be on our ground floor meeting space adjacent to
the building lobby on Dexter Ave, next to the Starbucks.  If you arrive via
bus routes 26, 28, 5, or the E line, you can enter on the 6th floor Aurora
Ave entrance and take the elevators outside of the access-controlled area
to the ground floor.  Late arrivals on Aurora Ave should take the public
stairs at Galer St or Highland Dr down to Dexter Ave.

Threat Modeling:

Everyone knows you ought to threat model, but in practical reality it turns
out to be tricky. If past efforts to threat model haven't panned out,
perhaps part of the problem is confusion over what works, and how the
various approaches conflict or align. This talk captures lessons
from years of work helping people throughout the software industry threat
model more effectively.  It's designed to help security pros, developers
and systems managers, all of whom will leave with both threat modeling
lessons from Star Wars and a proven foundation, enabling them to threat
model effectively.

Probabilistic Security:

There is a tendency among us (security professionals) to think of security
in deterministic terms. That was never a good idea and is less so in the
age of large distributed services that span the globe and use millions of
computers.  I'd like to make the case that the best security model is one
that mimics organic life that evolves continuously and develops an immune
systems that also adapts and evolves.  This talk and following discussion
will explore a wholly different approach to, and philosophy of, security in
large cloud platforms and online services.

There will also be a short briefing on some new declassified research on
Certificate Transparency from Brad Hill from FB's security team.
