Howdy,

	One of the speakers we had lined up for the 2/25 meeting had an unexpected change in his work plans and will not be able to speak. This leaves us with only one speaker for the meeting. If anyone would like to speak about a security related topic let me know. Otherwise we can make the meeting a bit more social than usual.

	Thanks,
	Mike de Libero
