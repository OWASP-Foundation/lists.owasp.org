If you are attending next Thursday's meeting, please RSVP so I can get
an accurate count for food and drinks. I received early RSVPs from a
month ago but please re-confirm in case your schedule has changed.

We have a couple of great appsec topics (Rapid Threat Modeling &
One-Click
Attacks) and two excellent speakers lined up so I'm looking forward to a
large turnout. Please call or email me if you have questions.

room at Las Margaritas.

Feature Presentation: Rapid Threat Modeling

One of the most important weapons in our arsenal for securing
applications is threat modeling. Applications are becoming increasingly
complex and new technologies are emerging constantly. In this scenario,
building or attacking applications is challenging. Threat models can
help attackers discover design vulnerabilities and mount complex
attacks. These models give secure application developers a great amount
of leverage to envision their design, implementation and soundness of
their architectures. Being living documents, they also carry forward any
knowledge gained from previous development life cycles and are
invaluable in understanding the impact of any changes to the overall
security posture of the applications. Understanding and constructing
meaningful threat models is hard. Application teams and attackers need
to be aware of what they want to model, how they want to model and when
they want to model. Rapid Threat Modeling will help them develop models
rapidly while reutilizing data they gathered either through
reconnaissance or through the software development lifecycle. A
practical hands-on demonstration of modeling threats for complex managed
application will allow for immediate use of any threat modeling
knowledge gained.

Featured Speaker: Robert Harvey

Rob Harvey is a privacy and security analyst with Microsoft working to
ensure that Microsoft's Line of Business applications meet corporate
privacy and security standards. Rob has over 4 years experience
performing application security testing and code reviews in the
software, telecommunications, multinational import/export and
transportation industries. He is a member of the renowned GhettoHackers
security organization. Before joining Microsoft, Rob was a Senior
Security Architect with IOActive, Inc.

2nd Presentation: One Click Attacks

The term "one-click attack" describes a technique whereby an attacker
can cause another user to unwittingly transmit HTTP requests of the
attacker's choice. This brief presentation will demonstrate a fairly
advanced example of the one-click attack, explore alternate attack
scenarios, and discuss prevention techniques.

Presenter: Eric Rachner

Eric Rachner is a freelance computer security professional and long-time
security enthusiast. His interest in the subject dates back to his teen
years and throughout a 10-year career at Microsoft where he most
recently held the position of Senior Security Analyst. Working in that
capacity for three years gave Eric a particular specialty in Web
application security as well as the opportunity to contribute a cover
feature on the subject for the August 2004 issue of asp.net PRO
Magazine. He has also contributed material on .NET-based Web
applications to the Microsoft .NET Developer book series.

Message-ID: <2496.24.16.205.170.1128617022.squirrel@webmail.owasp.org>

A few notes regarding tonight's meeting:

* For new members, the meeting is held in the Party Room of Las Margaritas
which is on the bottom floor. Free parking is in the back of the
restaurant and the entrance in the back takes you right to the room.

* Because of cold food issues at the last meeting, I will have the
appetizers brought out at 6:45pm and 7:15pm.  The beverages will be
brought out at 6:15 and the first presentation should start around 6:45

* If you are bringing a co-worker to the meeting tonight and have not
notified me, please drop me an email by 2pm so I can make adjustments in
the food/drink order.

I look forward to seeing everyone this evening.
