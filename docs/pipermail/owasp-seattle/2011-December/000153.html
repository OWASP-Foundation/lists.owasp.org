<PRE>I'm presenting an updated version of O2 at tonigth's OWASP Chapter meeting (
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Seattle">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Seattle</A>).

There are a number of new O2 features that I will cover, but to make it
relevant to the audience, I will present O2 as part of a challenge
which is*'Please Hack TeamMentor'
*.

TeamMentor&lt;<A HREF="http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2011/11/teammentor-v30-beta-is-out-of-bag-try.html">http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2011/11/teammentor-v30-beta-is-out-of-bag-try.html</A>&gt;is
the WebApp product (currently in
Beta&lt;<A HREF="http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2011/11/teammentor-v30-beta-is-out-of-bag-try.html">http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2011/11/teammentor-v30-beta-is-out-of-bag-try.html</A>&gt;)
I have been developing for Security Innovation with the help of O2 (you can
download TeamMentor Beta and its source code from
GitHub&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/SecurityInnovation/TeamMentor-3.0-beta/downloads">https://github.com/SecurityInnovation/TeamMentor-3.0-beta/downloads</A>&gt;).


Showing O2 this way will allow me to:

   - present and discuss the architecture of a real world app and its
   security implications

   - how me (as a developer) see security and its position on the
   development/management food-chain (btw on this topic, if you haven't you
   should also see my 'Making Security Invisible by Becoming the
   Developer's Best
Friends&lt;<A HREF="http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2011/10/my-presentation-at-owasp-appsec-brazil.html">http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2011/10/my-presentation-at-owasp-appsec-brazil.html</A>&gt;'
   presentation deliveled at OWASP AppSec Brazil and this amazing video
   response to it: A developer's rant about security
professionals&lt;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYEPYSF32kQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYEPYSF32kQ</A>&gt;)

   - how O2 allows me to deal with real world problems such as:

   - creating Unit Tests for jQuery/Ajax/WebServices based websites,
      - dealing with automation problems that ALL current browser
      automation engines have (WatiN, WatiR, Selenium, Cucumber, WebKit, QUnit,
      etc...) ,  and visualizing the data created using custom GUIs
(note that O2
      has native support for WatiN, NUnit and QUnit and has
access/control to all
      of .NET's WinForms/WPF)
      - creating cached versions of the site (controlled by a
      built-inside-O2 web proxy),
      - direcly invoke/compile specific parts/components of the application
      (this is used to create targeted Unit Tests &amp; fuzzing),
      - running consolidated (i.e. all available) NUnit tests using NUnit's
      GUI, command line and O2 scripts
      - dealing with complex webservices
      - view, analyse and test the server side RoleBase Authorization
      mappings (created using .NET Attributes) which affects the exposed
      WebServices

      - how the APIs and tools created by O2 purely as 'developer aids'
   (i.e. not for security) are then massively important, useful and usable on
   the UnitTesting phase.

For the 'hands-on' part of the crowd, I want to use the following OWASP
projects to help me with TeamMentor development and testing (and I really
could do with some help here):

   - *ESAPI (both .NET and Javascript) *- Starting with the Encoding part
   to deal with XSS (needs to be integrated with .NET's AntiXSS)
   - *AppSensor  *- to allow TeamMentor to modify its behaviour depending
   on its current 'attack' level
   - *OpenSAMM *- create a score card
   - *ZAP Proxy *- feed the existing O2 Browser automation scripts via
   ZAP's proxy and fire up its tests
   - *Agnitio *(not yet an OWASP)  - map out its check lists
   - *OWASP Testing, Code Review and Developer Guides *
   - ... *other OWASP projects*?  (if you are involved in an OWASP project
   that you think would be a good fit, please go for it)

What is interesting about TeamMentor is that it is a complex real world app
(with legacy code), containing tons of WebServices and JavaScript/jQuery
activity. This makes it very hard to test by today's tools (or even manual
process).

Also very important, is the fact that we are dealing with a team/company
that welcomes the 'Security' part of the SDL (which doesn't happen very
often :)  )

I'm very happy that SI is ok with this, and my hope is that this will allow
us to have a number of interesting conversations/threads (hard to happen in
test apps like WebGoat or HacmeBank, or apps where the main developers are
not directly engaged in the process)

For the ones that can't come tonight, I will follow up later this week with
more detailed instructions.

So here is your official invite: *Go and HACK TeamMentor
(GitHub&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/SecurityInnovation/TeamMentor-3.0-beta/downloads">https://github.com/SecurityInnovation/TeamMentor-3.0-beta/downloads</A>&gt;)
and report your findings as O2, NUnit, Python, Boo, etc. scripts. *

Btw, since this is a Beta version, I'm sure that there are still a number
of areas which have juicy security vulnerabilities! Good luck in finding
then :)

Only one condition, *I WILL NOT READ any findings reported in PDF format* :)
