Hi OWASP Seattle Members,

Just wanted to let everyone know that there is now an OWASP Seattle IRC
channel. You can use this chat room to ask general application security
questions, coordinate local Hack-Up events, or just hang out with like
minded folk.

IRC Server: irc.freenode.net
Channel: #owaspseattle

Look forward to seeing everyone there!
