Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] OWASP meeting Dec 14th
Message-ID: <4129.67.170.35.253.1133380333.squirrel@webmail.owasp.org>

Due to a trade show in New York I must attend on Dec 7-8, the next OWASP
Seattle meeting has been moved to Wednesday Dec 14th. The website has been
updated with the presentation lineup.
http://www.owasp.org/local/seattle.html

We have two excellent presentations scheduled that should appeal to both
application security testers and web developers: 'Cross-Site Forgery
Reference' and 'Improving the Secure Software Development Lifecycle'. Both
speakers are former @Stake guys with years of app security testing
experience.

As part of the holiday spirit, there will be an iPod Shuffle given away as
a door prize so bring your business card for the fish bowl.  Those who
already have an iPod can use the receipt to exchange it for another
gadget.

If you are attending the next meeting, please RSVP so I can get an
accurate count for food and drinks.
