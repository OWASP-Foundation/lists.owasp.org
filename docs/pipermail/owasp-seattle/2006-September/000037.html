<PRE>Hello!

As you know, Todd has stepped down as chapter leader of OWASP Seattle.
We have volunteered to take his place.   Since we will be meeting on a
regular basis, some introductions are in order:

Mike de Libero has been helping OWASP for about two and a half years in
the OWASP .Net area.  He is currently the lead developer of a
medium-sized freight company and also runs a part-time consulting
business, MDE Development, LLC.

Scott Stender is a co-founder of iSEC Partners, a digital security
consulting company based out of San Francisco and Seattle.  Scott works
in iSEC's application security practice, where he helps iSEC's customers
improve the security of their systems and performs research into the
security of core technologies.  You may know Scott from his
presentations to OWASP Seattle over the last couple of years.


We are looking forward to being a part of helping the OWASP Seattle
chapter continue its mission of furthering application security.  To
that end, we will keep the presentation-focused chapter meetings going
and hope to branch out into other projects.  Ideas that we have heard
thrown around would be to contribute to broader OWASP projects, have a
group-oriented review of a security technology or application, and bring
together panel discussions focusing on the latest attack-and-defense
methodologies.  If you have ideas of ways in which OWASP Seattle can
help push the state of application security forward, please email them
or bring them with you to the next chapter meeting.

Speaking of which, we are currently working on organizing the next
chapter meeting in the mid-September timeframe.  Keep an eye on your
inbox for details.

- Mike and Scott
