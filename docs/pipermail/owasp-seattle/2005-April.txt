I am pleased to announce we have Scott Stender of iSec Partners speaking

services-based architecture introduces a number of attack services that
need to be well understood and protected against misuse.

As we are having food and beverages served, please RSVP so I can give an
accurate count to the restaurant catering. The info below will be updated
