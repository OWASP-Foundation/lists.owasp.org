It's been too long... Let's do this!  We can now plan on the following:

Wednesday October 3 at 6:15PM

Once at Collins Pub, we can pick another location if preferred.  It's a
nice central spot to get started though.

The Collins Pub
 526 2nd Avenue
 Seattle, WA 98104
 thecollinspub.com?

I'll be there and will bring along some web-security-interested people
interested in conversation around the same.

Bring a friend, see you there,


Mat

Does Collins have a meeting room, or some such? Maybe a table in the back they can hold for us?sometimes having a group discussion in a pub is tough due to the noise.

There are quiet tables in the back at Collins.

Or, we can amble over to another place near by.  Lots of restaurants with a
few blocks there.
There is easy access paid parking across the street or street parking in
the surrounding blocks if you get lucky.

Hi Alaa,

I've attached a word doc with screenshots on how to setup an Android lab in
addition to some other tests you can perform. I've taken this out from a
presentation I did a while back so the word doc doesn't look very pretty
but it should give you a good intro.

I hope this helps. And if you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks

Tarek

Hello Everybody,

it's your friendly neighborhood absentee organizer.  :)  Due to travel and
other things, I have been completely off the grid for the last few months.
I am back, and I really want to get things started again.

So, the first thing I need is venues.  Everybody who works someplace that
you think could accomodate the group (it can be as much as 75 as little as
25) let me know ASAP.  I will get the first meeting scheduled as soon as I
get that worked out.  I do have some talks lined up already, so that much
is good!

Thanks!
-Raymond

The 2012 BayThreat Call For Papers is now open for a limited time!

This year's 2 day event will continue the Building and Breaking tracks from
last year, and additionally this year we are taking advantage of the theme
of our venue, Firehouse Brewery, to seek security first responders who are
willing to share some of their war stories from the field. (With the names
changed to protect the negligent, of course.)  Maybe you just have a great
story to tell - we'd like to hear about it and see if it fits!

If this is something that interests you, please check out
http://baythreat.org/cfp and let us know.

Submission Deadline: November 11th
(Bonus points for sending submissions in early!)

If you have any questions, please drop us a line.

Regards,

- The BayThreat Team
