Subject: [Owasp-seattle] 2008 ISSA Northwest Regional Security Conference
Message-ID: <47FD6AF5.2090905@axley.net>

Thought you Northwest security folks would be interested in this
conference that I've helped plan.  There are some application
security presentations on the technical track, but there is also
a business track to cover your non-techie security pros.  Spread
the word!
