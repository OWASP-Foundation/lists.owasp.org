Securing our Legacy
Responding to the call to provide practical security assurance

Scott Stender
Partner, iSEC Partners,  Inc.

Every few months witnesses the release of a much-hailed report from an  
industry organization, think tank, or government agency calling for  
the software that runs our critical infrastructure to be secured.    
Making the call is easy, acting on it is only slightly harder, but  
succeeding at it is incredibly difficult.

Of all of the tasks that must be undertaken to truly meet the call,  
the single biggest challenge I have seen companies face is delivering  
security assurance on legacy code.  This talk will explore the  
challenge of providing security assurance for these old, little-loved,  
but heroic systems that power our lives.   More importantly, It will  
include guidance for software development managers and engineers  
seeking to gain insight into the operation of their legacy systems,  
mechanisms by which important security assertions can be gathered, and  
practical methods for carrying out penetration tests and code reviews  
with the aim of providing a high degree of security assurance.

Scott Stender is a co-founder and Partner of iSEC Partners, a  
strategic digital security organization. Scott brings with him several  
years of experience in large-scale software development and security  
consulting, having worked at  @stake and Microsoft in previous lives.

In his research, Scott focuses on secure software engineering  
methodology and analysis of core technologies. Scott has been  
published in publications such as IEEE Security & Privacy, and has  
presented at Microsoft Blue Hat and at Black Hat conferences on  
several occasions. Scott holds a BS in Computer Engineering from the  
University of Notre Dame.

experience delivering results for leading ecommerce merchants.

He is currently Sr. Manager Payments & Security in the Media  
Applications Platform Development Division for e-Commerce products for

comprehensive insight into security and payments processing.

Ashok is responsible for the Billing for Real?s Consumer Divisions. He  
takes a leadership role in identifying new opportunities in the  
consumer payments domain. He has extensive hands on experience in
