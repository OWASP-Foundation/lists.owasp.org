Ok everybody, we have all that we need to make a meeting.  A speaker and a location (F5 offices in Seattle).  The meeting will be Feb 23rd.   Tomorrow I will be making a meetup.com invite for the event. 

Sorry this has taken me so long but should be fun!

Hell All,

Ok, we have a meeting set up which means we have a speaker and a venue!

First, the speaker is Kevin Dyer.  Kevin is a Phd student at Portland State University and he will be talking to us about encryption leakage and why traffic analysis countermeasures fail.

As a bonus, we will have a couple of people walk us through how they broke into a screen locked android phone.  Should help all of us a bit more paranoid. ;-)

Details are on our meetup.com page:

Hope to see you there!
