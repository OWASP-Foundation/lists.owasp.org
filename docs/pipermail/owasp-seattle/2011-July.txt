John:

I don't think it has anything to do with your account.  You are just getting
a reflection from the [ owasp-seattle at lists.owasp.org] smtp server which I
don't think is being maintained right now.

best regards,
Just another consumer of the [ owasp-seattle at lists.owasp.org ] list

The message was undeliverable due to the following reason(s):

Your message was not delivered because the destination computer was
not reachable within the allowed queue period. The amount of time
a message is queued before it is returned depends on local configura-
tion parameters.

Most likely there is a network problem that prevented delivery, but
it is also possible that the computer is turned off, or does not
have a mail system running right now.

Your message could not be delivered within 3 days:
Host 42.223.192.251 is not responding.

The following recipients could not receive this message:
