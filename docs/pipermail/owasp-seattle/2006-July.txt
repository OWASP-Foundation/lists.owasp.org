Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] Next meeting?
Message-ID: <49cfc2150607241043l63f5c88avc654fc6ee8e02085@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

My name is Mark Garcia and I currently work at Farecast.com as a Sr. Systems
Engineer.  I thought I'd introduce myself and peg someone for any
information regarding the next scheduled meeting.  I came across the Seattle
Chapter for OWASP as I was attempting to play devils advocate for our
developers and reverse engineer our AJAX implementation.  I read about the
last meeting in January and was curious if anything was planned for the next
quarterly meeting?

Cheers,

Same question here.  The last meeting I went to was great and am eager for another.
