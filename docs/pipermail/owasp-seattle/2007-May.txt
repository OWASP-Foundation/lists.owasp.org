Message-ID: <46530234.2010407@mde-dev.com>

Hello Guys & Gals,

    I am curious if there are any presentations you would like to see at 
the OWASP Seattle chapter in the next few months? 

    Sorry for the delay on the next chapter meeting but we are working 
on it :). 

    Thanks,
    Mike de Libero
