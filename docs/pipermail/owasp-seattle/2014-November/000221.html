<PRE>Hello,

  Sorry for the short notice but we have our first OWASP Seattle meeting in awhile! Below is the pertinent information. Please RSVP to us so we make sure we have enough room and most importanly food and beverages. We are still working on the location and next time we won&#8217;t have this problem, sorry about the inconvenience. 
  
  Date and time: 11/12/2014 @ 6PM
  Location: TBD (Somewhere in SLU, SODO, Downtown Seattle area)
  
  Rough Agenda:
  6PM - Food and social gathering
  7PM - First Speaker
  8PM - Second Speaker
  
  Speakers:
  
  --== Robert Wood ==--
  Abstract: Too often organizations conduct assessments within a vacuum: physical, network, social, or application-layer. Attackers do not confine themselves similarly and avail themselves of whatever combination of techniques most effectively achieves their desired impact. Red team assessments aim to simulate these attacks more realistically and identify risk through composite, cross-domain attack vectors. This talk will cover several
shortcomings with the current &quot;model&quot; of red teaming across the industry and how we can more effectively incorporate the application-specific attack surface into a red team effort. War stories will be shared to show the effectiveness of application-centric composite attacks in this new approach.

  Bio: Robert Wood is a Technical Manager at Cigital and leads the development and execution of the red team assessment practice for the firm. Robert has worked with a number of clients spanning from Fortune 100 financial institutions to gaming companies providing services at every stage in the SDLC. Prior to Cigital, Robert worked for Secure Network Technologies where he developed the mobile forensic investigation practice and focused his penetration testing efforts on red teaming and network security assessments. 

  --== Rennie deGraaf ==--
  Abstract: SVG is an XML-based format for vector graphics. Modern web browsers support it natively and allow it to be styled using CSS and manipulated using JavaScript. It is less well-known that SVG can contain its own JavaScript and can import external scripts and stylesheets. Consequently, from a browser security perspective, SVG must be treated like HTML; treating it like JPEG will lead to great suffering.
  
  Bio: Rennie deGraaf is a security consultant with iSEC Partners, a strategic digital security organization.In the past, he has worked as a software developer at Microsoft, a researcher at the University of Calgary, and a system administrator at Industrial Defender (back when it was still Verano). He has a MSc in Computer Science specializing in network security, specifically firewalling tricks such as port knocking and SPA.
  
  
  
  
  We look forward to seeing everyone there!
  
  Thanks,
  Mike, Mike, Ian and Braden
