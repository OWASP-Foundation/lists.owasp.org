Ok, I got some details on what we presentations we will see at this OWASP meeting!

So, we will actually have two presenters.   First, Jim Manico will be joining us via Skype:

Title: Top Ten Web Defenses
We cannot ?firewall? or ?patch? our way to secure websites. In the past,
security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
well-protected websites are occurring every day. Most every organization
in the world have something in common ? they have had websites
compromised in some way. No company or industry is immune. Programmers
need to learn to build websites differently. This talk will review the
top coding techniques developers need to master in order to build a
low-risk, high-security web application.


BIO: Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat
Security, a web security firm. He authors and delivers developer
security awareness training for WhiteHat Security and has a background
building software as a developer and architect for over 20 years. Jim is
also a global board member for the OWASP foundation where he helps drive
the strategic vision for the organization. He manages and participates
in several OWASP projects, including the OWASP cheat sheet series and
several additional secure coding projects.



After that, we have Brad Hill.

Title: "HTML5 Security Realities"

Abstract: It's almost conventional wisdom in the security biz that HTML5 is a nightmare of unnecessary complexity and attack surface, but should you believe the hype?  Brad challenges those notions in this talk with a report on the state of security in the modern browser and shows how to use emerging standards to solve some of the big problems of Web security.

Bio: Brad Hill is an iSEC alum at PayPal, where he does security research and standards development, including serving as the co-chair of the Web Application Security Working Group at the W3C.
