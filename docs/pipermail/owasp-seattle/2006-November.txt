Message-ID: <4563659E.5010505@mde-dev.com>

Hello,

Well this email is a little bit later than "right after the meeting" but
we are finally sending it dang it!  :) 

Here are a few thoughts that we (Mike and Scott) have had about the
OWASP Seattle chapter and we would like your feedback.

- Take on one OWASP Project (like finishing the vulnerabilities area of
OWASP).
- Audit an Open Source project and report the findings
- Test an OWASP program and help further the quality of it
- Do we like the meeting place to be Bellevue or would a different area
be better? Should we stay on the Eastside? Go to Downtown Seattle? 
Go up North? Go down South (No, not Mexico)? Does anyone have a
preference?
- What would you like for the chapter to do / focus on? More research?
More OWASP related things? Honing skills?

Please let us know your thoughts and we are looking forward to your
feedback.

We are working on the next meeting and will be announcing details as we
get them.

Thanks,
Mike & Scott

Downtown Seattle :)

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/.NET_Web_Service_Validation

It's new, just moving it over to OWASP, could use some testing and feedback.

How about making the OWASP wiki suck less by flushing out the
information about security issues and how they are resolved.  The wiki
is rather depressing right now.

I'm guessing you mean "fleshing" out the issues, as opposed to flushing
(i.e. purging) them? =) =)

Anyway, I'm another downtown Seattle person, but as a former Eastsider I
recognize the need for compromise here, so I propose looking for a venue on
Mercer Island.

What specific parts of the wiki "suck" the most? 

The first thing you can do with the .NET web service is to check it into 
the Google SVN code base.  Let me know your google login and I will get 
you setup.  After that I can help out on the .net web service. 

Thanks,
Mike

The wiki does not contain enough information on current issues,
solutions, and best practices to be very useful to the common person.
Additionally, little work goes into updating existing entries with
links to other parts of the site.  I mean, check out the Java project.
Most of the topic areas are at 0%.

Here is an example of help needed: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/LDAP_injection

No examples, no links or best practices on mitigation, no links to
other ldap pages on the owasp wiki, no links to papers.

I think we should adopt a topic once a every other month and do the following:

  1. Flesh the topic out with good content
  2. Add links to current information, papers, etc
  3. Cross-link with other pages on the owasp wiki
  4. Create or verify mitigation solutions for: Java, .NET, and PHP

ps- Have a google svn for it, i'll add it to the page.
