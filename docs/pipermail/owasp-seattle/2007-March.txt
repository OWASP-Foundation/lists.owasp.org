Subject: [Owasp-seattle] First Ever OWASP Seattle Hack-A-Thon
Message-ID: <45E72FC1.4070305@mde-dev.com>

Hello,

    I sent this idea out a long time ago but I finally got around to 
setting it up.  The mission if anyone chooses to accept it is to attack 
WordPress Mu (I will set it up on my server) and  find bugs, be merry 
and drink bier if you want.  The details follow:

*When*: 3/22/2007 @ 7 o'clock
*Where*: Prost! (http://www.prosttavern.net/directions.php)  
*What to bring:* Your laptop if you have one, your brain, and whatever 
else you need for a good time.
*What NOT to bring:* A huge ego :P. 

Any bugs we find will be logged anonymously or if you want to log them 
yourself go for it. 

I will have the source if anyone wants to grep through it they can.  I 
understand that not everyone will be able to do this for a variety of 
reasons so it is not a requirement to participate. 

If anyone has any questions about this feel free to ping me and I will 
be happy to answer them. 

    Thanks,
    Mike de Libero
    OWASP Seattle Chapter Co-Leader
