<PRE>Hello,

	Just a reminder about tomorrow's OWASP chapter meeting.  I hope to  
see everyone there!

	Thanks,
	Mike

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	We have lined up our next set of speakers for the OWASP Seattle
</I>&gt;<i> chapter meeting.  It will be on 6/12/08 at the Bellevue Las Margaritas
</I>&gt;<i> (address below). The speaker line up is below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Location: Bellevue Las Margaritas
</I>&gt;<i> 437 108th Ave NE
</I>&gt;<i> Bellevue, WA 98004
</I>&gt;<i> (425) 453-0535
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Date: 06/12/2008
</I>&gt;<i> Time: 6:30PM
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speakers:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaker: Taylor McKinley
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dynamic Taint Propagation: Finding Vulnerabilities Without Attacking
</I>&gt;<i> Dynamic taint propagation allows testers to find vulnerabilities
</I>&gt;<i> without modifying existing functional tests. It enables true security
</I>&gt;<i> testing inside a QA organization because it allows tight integration
</I>&gt;<i> with existing QA infrastructure and solid usability for non-security
</I>&gt;<i> experts. This talk will:
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; Explain how dynamic taint propagation works.
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; Show how to retrofit an existing executable to perform dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> taint propagation.
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; Demonstrate how a tester can use a typical suite of functional
</I>&gt;<i> tests to find vulnerabilities, without the need for malicious input or
</I>&gt;<i> security expertise.
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; Compare this approach with the effectiveness of popular penetration
</I>&gt;<i> testing tools--particularly those acquired by IBM and HP in 2007--when
</I>&gt;<i> deployed in a QA environment.
</I>&gt;<i> The talk will conclude with a look towards the future of security
</I>&gt;<i> testing in the QA environment and an overview of how multiple analysis
</I>&gt;<i> techniques, both static and dynamic, can work together to provide
</I>&gt;<i> better software assurance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Taylor McKinley, Product Manager, Fortify Software
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. McKinley brings a rich business and technology background to
</I>&gt;<i> Fortify Software, including strategic advisory roles at Morgan Stanley
</I>&gt;<i> Dean Witter, New England Capital Partners and as a Principal at The
</I>&gt;<i> Parthenon Group. Mr. McKinley has a BA from Williams College and an
</I>&gt;<i> MBA from Stanford Business School.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaker: Scott Stender
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concurrency Attacks in Web Applications
</I>&gt;<i> Modern web application frameworks are designed for developer
</I>&gt;<i> productivity and performance. They are highly scalable, object-
</I>&gt;<i> oriented, and can be used to create a usable web site in a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> Highly parallelized, object-oriented web application frameworks
</I>&gt;<i> encourage programming practices that make managing state difficult for
</I>&gt;<i> a typical programmer. In order to have a web application that is
</I>&gt;<i> robust in a multi-threaded environment, the developer must carefully
</I>&gt;<i> manage access to all resources that can shared by threads. Global
</I>&gt;<i> variables, session variables, database access, and back-end systems
</I>&gt;<i> are common examples of such resources, not to mention application-
</I>&gt;<i> specific resources.
</I>&gt;<i> Concurrency flaws result when security-sensitive resources are not
</I>&gt;<i> managed properly. As we have seen with almost every other prevalent
</I>&gt;<i> class of security flaws, mistakes happen often when doing the right
</I>&gt;<i> thing is difficult. To make things worse, concurrency flaws are often
</I>&gt;<i> subtle and are identified only through difficult targeted testing.
</I>&gt;<i> This presentation will provide brief technical background against this
</I>&gt;<i> class of flaw and enumerate testing techniques that help identify when
</I>&gt;<i> flaws are present.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott Stender is a founding partner of iSEC Partners, a strategic
</I>&gt;<i> digital security organization. Scott brings with him several years of
</I>&gt;<i> experience in large-scale software development and security
</I>&gt;<i> consulting, having worked at companies such as @stake and Microsoft.
</I>&gt;<i> Scott is a noted researcher who focuses on secure software engineering
</I>&gt;<i> and security analysis of core technologies. He holds a BS in Computer
</I>&gt;<i> Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As always if there is any topic you would like to hear about please
</I>&gt;<i> let us know and we will try and find a speaker.  Also, if there are
</I>&gt;<i> any improvements you would like to see made for this chapter let us
</I>&gt;<i> know about that as well :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Mike de Libero &amp; Scott Stender
