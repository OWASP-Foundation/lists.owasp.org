Date: 06/12/2008
Time: 6:30PM

Speaker: Taylor McKinley

Dynamic Taint Propagation: Finding Vulnerabilities Without Attacking
Dynamic taint propagation allows testers to find vulnerabilities  
without modifying existing functional tests. It enables true security  
testing inside a QA organization because it allows tight integration  
with existing QA infrastructure and solid usability for non-security  
experts. This talk will:
	&#8226; Explain how dynamic taint propagation works.
	&#8226; Show how to retrofit an existing executable to perform dynamic  
taint propagation.
	&#8226; Demonstrate how a tester can use a typical suite of functional  
tests to find vulnerabilities, without the need for malicious input or  
security expertise.
	&#8226; Compare this approach with the effectiveness of popular penetration  
testing tools--particularly those acquired by IBM and HP in 2007--when  
deployed in a QA environment.
The talk will conclude with a look towards the future of security  
testing in the QA environment and an overview of how multiple analysis  
techniques, both static and dynamic, can work together to provide  
better software assurance.

Taylor McKinley, Product Manager, Fortify Software
Mr. McKinley brings a rich business and technology background to  
Fortify Software, including strategic advisory roles at Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter, New England Capital Partners and as a Principal at The  
Parthenon Group. Mr. McKinley has a BA from Williams College and an  
MBA from Stanford Business School.

Speaker: Scott Stender

Concurrency Attacks in Web Applications
Modern web application frameworks are designed for developer  
productivity and performance. They are highly scalable, object- 
oriented, and can be used to create a usable web site in a matter of  
minutes.
Highly parallelized, object-oriented web application frameworks  
encourage programming practices that make managing state difficult for  
a typical programmer. In order to have a web application that is  
robust in a multi-threaded environment, the developer must carefully  
manage access to all resources that can shared by threads. Global  
variables, session variables, database access, and back-end systems  
are common examples of such resources, not to mention application- 
specific resources.
Concurrency flaws result when security-sensitive resources are not  
managed properly. As we have seen with almost every other prevalent  
class of security flaws, mistakes happen often when doing the right  
thing is difficult. To make things worse, concurrency flaws are often  
subtle and are identified only through difficult targeted testing.
This presentation will provide brief technical background against this  
class of flaw and enumerate testing techniques that help identify when  
flaws are present.

Scott Stender is a founding partner of iSEC Partners, a strategic  
digital security organization. Scott brings with him several years of  
experience in large-scale software development and security  
consulting, having worked at companies such as @stake and Microsoft.  
Scott is a noted researcher who focuses on secure software engineering  
and security analysis of core technologies. He holds a BS in Computer  
Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.

As always if there is any topic you would like to hear about please  
let us know and we will try and find a speaker.  Also, if there are  
any improvements you would like to see made for this chapter let us  
know about that as well :).

Thanks,
Mike de Libero &amp; Scott Stender
