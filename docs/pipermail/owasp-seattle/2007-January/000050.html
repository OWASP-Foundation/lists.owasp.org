<PRE>Hello,

Well it sounds like we have a good line up for this month's OWASP 
Seattle Chapter meeting. Please RSVP to this email so we can make sure 
to order enough food and cerveza for everyone ;). Details for meeting 
are as follows:

Location: Bellevue Las Margaritas (<A HREF="http://www.lasmargaritasbellevue.com/">http://www.lasmargaritasbellevue.com/</A>)
Time: 6 o&#8217;clock.

Speakers:
* Dinis Cruz (Chief OWASP Evangelist) - Directly from London, Dinis will 
be doing two presentations at this event:
o Buffer Overflows on .Net and Asp.Net - One of the common myths about 
the .Net Framework is that it is immune to buffer overflows. Although 
this might be correct in pure managed and verifiable .Net code, large 
percentage of .Net and Asp.Net applications code is unmanaged. In this 
talk Dinis will show the areas in .Net and Asp.Net applications that are 
vulnerable to buffer overflows (including the demo of a .Net Buffer 
Overflow Fuzzer).
o OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project - The Open Web 
Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to 
enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications 
that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, blogs, and 
chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application 
security. In this presentation Dinis will show the latest guides and 
tools from OWASP which should be part of every company's security efforts.

* Brad Hill (Senior Security Consultant with iSEC Partners), will be 
speaking on:
o XML Digital Signature and Encryption: Use and Abuse - The WS-Security 
set of standards is on the threshold of ubiquitous deployment and XML 
applications have already taken over the world. This presentation looks 
at two underlying technologies, XML Digital Signature (XMLDSIG) and XML 
Encryption (XMLENC), their place in the Web Services stack and their 
applicability to non-SOAP XML applications. Beginning with a basic 
overview of the standards, we will uncover some surprising caveats and 
risks in the use of these technologies.

Once again please let me know if you are planning on attending. We are 
looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Thanks,
Mike de Libero &amp; Scott Stender
