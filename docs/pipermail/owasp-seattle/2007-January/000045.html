<PRE>Hello,

    So I am planning a night where we go do an assessment on an open 
source application and maybe have a few beers (or whatever you prefer).  
But, I would like to give everyones opinion before nailing down the 
details.  Here are my tentative plans.

Apps to assess:
  - Mediawiki (we will log the bugs anonymously if any are found)
  - An example site through the OWASP SiteGenerator (This will be easier 
and for people who want to get some practice in)
 
Where:
  - Prost! (<A HREF="http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/10774483">http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/10774483</A>).  Why? 
Because they have good beer and free wifi..

When:
  - Some Saturday night (anyone have objections to that night??)

What to bring:
  - A laptop if you have it
  - A good attitude

What not to bring:
  - Over-inflated egos :)

    I will setup a box for us to assess mediawiki against as long as no 
one actually attacks the server and not the actual app :). 

    The reason I want to do this is so that we can all learn different 
tools and methodologies that we each use and also for some of the newer 
people in the field to learn from the more experienced people (and maybe 
vice-versa) and so we can all meet new people in this field.

    Well let me know your thoughts and if you would like to see this happen.

    Thanks,
    Mike de Libero
    OWASP Seattle Chapter co-leader
