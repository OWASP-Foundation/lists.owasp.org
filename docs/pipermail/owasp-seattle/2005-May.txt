Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] June 9th Meeting Agenda
Message-ID: <37598.209.20.238.77.1115240389.squirrel@webmail.owasp.org>

Thanks to all who attended last week's meeting. Scott Stender's
presentation on Web Services Security was very well received. The next
meeting will be June 9th and I still have an opening for a short 20-30
minute presentation to end the evening. Tell the members about your
company's app security successes with OWASP, best practice techniques or
policies that are working, or demonstrate some cool application testing
examples.

Scott's Powerpoint will be available in 1-2 weeks on the OWASP site and the
meeting announcement below will be posted in a few hours.

Everyone with an interest in coding security is welcome to join our
chapter meetings. The next meeting will be held Thursday night, June 9th
at the following location:

Las Margaritas Restaurant

tel: (425) 453-0535

Appetizers, beer and wine will be served and vegetarian items are provided
at all events. The meeting will be held in a private meeting room at Las
Margaritas.

Feature Presentation: Application Firewall Panel
Featured Speakers: TBD

What are application firewalls, where in the application infrastructure
are they placed, and do they work? And will a traditional Web application
firewall protect XML-enabled applications? The application firewall forum
will include a panel of engineers from manufacturers of Web and XML
firewalls. There will be a Q&A session so you can ask questions about the
technologies in an open forum. The panel focus will be on technical
features and implementation.

provided at chapter meetings is in the interest of the members of the
