Subject: [Owasp-seattle] Call for help on OWASP.Net tools
Message-ID: <469ED98D.5070006@mde-dev.com>

Hello,

    I was wondering if anyone on this list has a little bit of extra 
time to help Dinis, Boris and I out on the OWASP .Net tools.  If anyone 
does please reply to me directly and we can work together on what you 
would like to do. 

    I am hoping since we are so close to Microsoft that there a few of 
us who do .Net development regularly and can really further the quality 
of these tools. 

    This is also a great chance to get your name known out in the 
community or get experience to start in the AppSec field.  Also, there 
are a few grants open so you could make some extra cash to :). 

    Thanks,
    Mike de Libero
