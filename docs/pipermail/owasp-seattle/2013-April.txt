Subject: [Owasp-seattle] Privilege Separation in HTML5 Applications
Message-ID: <CAFAWrP=C0q8ctRdz=gEm-WaCJLL5WxMu1YzV6ui3nB9ETiXHcQ@mail.gmail.com>

During last night's meeting I brought up an excellent paper that was
recently brought to my attention, Privilege Separation in HTML5
Applications by Devdatta Akhawe, Prateek Saxena, and Dawn Song at the
University of California, Berkeley. They show how applications written
with JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS constructs can reduce their trusted
computing base by 6x to 1000x using a privilieged parent component to
spawn untrusted children components in temporary origins (thus
leveraging the same origin policy to enforce separation).

Brad Hill discussed this paper in his recent W3Conf HTML5 Security
Realities talk,
