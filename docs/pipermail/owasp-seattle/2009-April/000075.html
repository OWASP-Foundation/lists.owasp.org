&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	So, after a lengthy delay we have lined up some speakers, reserved  
</I>&gt;<i> the room and set the date for the next OWASP Seattle chapter  
</I>&gt;<i> meeting.  As always there will be food, grog (e.g. beer, pop and  
</I>&gt;<i> water) here is the pertinent information:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Date: 4/28/2009 (that is next Tuesday)
</I>&gt;<i> Time: 6:30PM ish
</I>&gt;<i> Location: Las Margaritas in Bellevue (437 108th Ave NW Bellevue, WA  
</I>&gt;<i> 98004)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	If you could please RSVP to me so I can know roughly how many  
</I>&gt;<i> people are going to show I would greatly appreciate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Last but not least here is the speaker line-up:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;speakers&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Securing our Legacy Responding to the call to provide practical  
</I>&gt;<i> security assurance  Scott Stender Partner, iSEC Partners,  Inc.  
</I>&gt;<i> Every few months witnesses the release of a much-hailed report from  
</I>&gt;<i> an industry organization, think tank, or government agency calling  
</I>&gt;<i> for the software that runs our critical infrastructure to be  
</I>&gt;<i> secured.   Making the call is easy, acting on it is only slightly  
</I>&gt;<i> harder, but succeeding at it is incredibly difficult. Of all of the  
</I>&gt;<i> tasks that must be undertaken to truly meet the call, the single  
</I>&gt;<i> biggest challenge I have seen companies face is delivering security  
</I>&gt;<i> assurance on legacy code.  This talk will explore the challenge of  
</I>&gt;<i> providing security assurance for these old, little-loved, but heroic  
</I>&gt;<i> systems that power our lives.   More importantly, It will include  
</I>&gt;<i> guidance for software development managers and engineers seeking to  
</I>&gt;<i> gain insight into the operation of their legacy systems, mechanisms  
</I>&gt;<i> by which important security assertions can be gathered, and  
</I>&gt;<i> practical methods for carrying out penetration tests and code  
</I>&gt;<i> reviews with the aim of providing a high degree of security  
</I>&gt;<i> assurance. Scott Stender is a co-founder and Partner of iSEC  
</I>&gt;<i> Partners, a strategic digital security organization. Scott brings  
</I>&gt;<i> with him several years of experience in large-scale software  
</I>&gt;<i> development and security consulting, having worked at  @stake and  
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft in previous lives.  In his research, Scott focuses on  
</I>&gt;<i> secure software engineering methodology and analysis of core  
</I>&gt;<i> technologies. Scott has been published in publications such as IEEE  
</I>&gt;<i> Security &amp; Privacy, and has presented at Microsoft Blue Hat and at  
</I>&gt;<i> Black Hat conferences on several occasions. Scott holds a BS in  
</I>&gt;<i> Computer Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.    
</I>&gt;<i> Application Issues with encryption of PANs. Ashok Misra Sr. Manager  
</I>&gt;<i> Paymens &amp; Security, Real Networks There are unique application  
</I>&gt;<i> issues related to the storage and processing of credit card numbers  
</I>&gt;<i> for ecommerce transaction processing. This talk focuses on issues  
</I>&gt;<i> with the various cryptographic primitives used for PANs.  Ashok  
</I>&gt;<i> Misra is an Ecommerce professional with more than 10 years  
</I>&gt;<i> experience delivering results for leading ecommerce merchants. He is  
</I>&gt;<i> currently Sr. Manager Payments &amp; Security in the Media Applications  
</I>&gt;<i> Platform Development Division for e-Commerce products for Real  
</I>&gt;<i> Networks, Inc in Seattle, Washington. He brings an unusually  
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive insight into security and payments processing. Ashok  
</I>&gt;<i> is responsible for the Billing for Real&#8217;s Consumer Divisions. He  
</I>&gt;<i> takes a leadership role in identifying new opportunities in the  
</I>&gt;<i> consumer payments domain. He has extensive hands on experience in  
</I>&gt;<i> merchant integration with several leading payment providers. Prior  
</I>&gt;<i> to working with Real Networks he built backend components for  
</I>&gt;<i> ecommerce for Amazon.com. He has comprehensive domain knowledge in  
</I>&gt;<i> consumer payments over the internet with Credit Cards, EU Direct  
</I>&gt;<i> Debit , Real time Bank Transfers , Redirect Payment Instruments,  
</I>&gt;<i> Fraud Detection and PCI Compliance.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/speakers&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope to see y'all there and if you could let me know you are  
</I>&gt;<i> coming that would be cool :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
