Subject: [Owasp-seattle] November Seattle OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <2E9C758A-F7E6-4AFD-A0E5-CEF58F5C702D@mde-dev.com>

Hello,

	Scott and I have setup the next Seattle OWASP meeting.  The details  
are below.  Please let me know if you plan on making it, so we can  
make sure to have enough food and beverages.

	Location: Bellevue Las Margaritas
			  437 108th Ave NE
	     	          Bellevue, WA 98004
			  (425) 453-0535
	
	Date: 11/29/2007
	Time: 6PM

	Speakers:

	Tom Gallagher has been intrigued with both physical and computer  
security from a young age. He is currently the lead of the Microsoft  
Office Security Test team. This team is primarily focused on  
penetration testing, writing security testing tools, and educating  
program managers, developers, and testers about security issues. Tom  
recently co-authored the MSPress title "Hunting Security Bugs".

	Presentation Title: Hunting security bugs in your code

Description: Finding security bugs is often regarded as an activity  
requiring secret powers or extremely specialized knowledge.  Some  
security bugs are difficult to uncover and require deep knowledge.   
However, with basic knowledge many areas can be tested without much  
effort.  This presentation will show how to perform basic security  
testing using simple tools and the difference in effort between  
finding a bug and exploiting it.


	David E Stevens III, Senior ROI Analyst, Symplified Inc.

In 2006, Symplified recruited Stevens for his expertise and ability to  
clearly explain concepts like Return On Investment (ROI) and Total  
Cost of Ownership (TCO). Over the past 5 years Stevens has given  
dozens of presentations regarding ROI, and is a confident and  
charismatic speaker. Stevens is touring the U.S. representing  
Symplified and teaching how ROI can be applied to security and  
Identity investments to technical security user groups.

	Synopsis of "Understanding ROI, TCO and other key financial aspects  
of IT Security"

In this presentation, Stevens teaches how security and IT  
professionals can obtain financing for important security initiatives  
using accounting principles such as Return On Investment (ROI) and  
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). In this 30-minute presentation, the  
group learns what these terms mean and how they can be used to show  
the value of security software purchases. He concludes by sharing  
other tips on how the technology professional can better communicate  
with their business counterparts. This non-sales presentation is  
intended to equip attendees with useful tools that articulate the  
benefits of investing in IT security. Learn from Symplified's more  
than 30 years combined experience in Identity Management at hundreds  
of Fortune 500 organizations worldwide. Attendees receive a useful ROI  
calculator for IDM investments. This is a must attend presentation for  
anyone who has ever had trouble getting the funding they needed for a  
security software investment!


	We look forward to seeing everyone there.

	Thanks,
	Mike de Libero & Scott Stender

Subject: [Owasp-seattle] Follow-up on synergy
Message-ID: <474FA0B3.3040301@gmail.com>

Someone mentioned at tonight's meeting that synergy does clipboard 
transferring similar to the application that Tom showed in his demo.

I found this on the synergy site 
(http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/security.html)

"Synergy does not do any authentication or encryption. Any computer can 
connect to the synergy server if it provides a screen name known to the 
server, and all data is transferred between the server and the clients 
unencrypted which means that anyone can, say, extract the key presses 
used to type a password. Therefore, synergy should not be used on 
untrusted networks."

It goes on to suggest port forwarding synergy traffic through ssh as a 
means to encrypt the traffic. Instructions are at the link above.
