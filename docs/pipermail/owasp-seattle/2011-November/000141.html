&gt;<i> Hi folks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The November OWASP Seattle Meeting will feature Bryan Sullivan's talk &quot;No SQL and even less security&quot;. There will be plenty of technical demos of NOSQL security issues and server-side JS security issues. Think &quot;the trendy stack gets a good dust up&quot; and should should be pretty close!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The meeting will take place at the KPMG offices in downtown Seattle. If you haven't already you should go ahead and RSVP at the link below. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-OWASP-Chapter/events/37444702/">http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-OWASP-Chapter/events/37444702/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have a room that holds approximately 40 (i.e smaller than we would ideally like). There are currently 50 signed up and 17 on the wait-list. I know from previous experience that not everyone turns up and so I would encourage everyone to attend even if you are on the wait list. It maybe standing room only if you don't get there early! If you accepted but now will not be attending please change your status to free up the wait list! 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You MUST be on the accepted list (or the wait list) with a real name in order to attend. If you are not on either I am afraid we can't let you in. This is because the security guard at KPMG offices may ask for ID and will have the list of attendees. I recommend some folks like &quot;goldfish&quot; and &quot;your Name Here&quot;update their details. If they haven't been updated by the day of the event I will have to remove them from the list to open up slots for the wait list. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sponsorship : If any company wants to sponsor beers afterwards in Faados across the street drop me a note. I am sure it will be appreciate by those joining us for beers afterwards. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Twitter hashtag will be #owaspseattle and be sure to follow @owaspseattle for late breaking news!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Look forward to seeing you all there!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!
