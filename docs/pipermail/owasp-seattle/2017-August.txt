We've got some Deja microtalks on microservices and a tale of DDoS far on
the schedule.

RSVPs are smaller than usual due to sponsored venue space limitations.

Please contact me if you would like to give a lightning talk style
presentation on what you've been working on and I'll get you on the list.
