Well, as you have probably figured out there is no meeting in January.  ;-)  I apologize for that, the holidays were a bit on the crazy side for me.  I do have a speaker lined up for February and am working on lining up a venue so stay tuned for that!

Hello Everybody!

I apologize for the radio silence, I have been working on the next meeting and still a couple of details to take care of.

First, I very much plan on having a meeting in February.  The plan is for this meeting to happen Feb 23rd.  I have a speaker lined up and am working on getting a venue.  I am hoping to have that nailed down.  With that, if anybody else has space they think would make a great venue for upcoming meetings please feel free to contact me.

My plan is to have a meeting for the near future every other month.  I have speakers lined up for the next few meetings so we will see how it goes from there.  :)

Thanks for your patience and I look forward to seeing people at the next meeting.

-Raymond Forbes
