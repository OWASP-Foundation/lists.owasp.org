<PRE>Mike,
Might have an available space in Bellevue at the Group Health facility off of NE 8th. My boss should be sending me information on how to reserve after hour rooms.

Subject: [Owasp-seattle] Talks? Speakers? Venues?

Howdy Everyone!

        I am going to try and get a OWASP Seattle chapter meet-up setup in the coming weeks / month. But if possible I would love some help. If anyone has ideas / input / leads for any of the following things I would greatly appreciate it.

- What topics / talks would we like to see happen at this meeting or in future ones?
- Does anyone wish to speak and/or know someone who wants to give a presentation?
- Does anyone know of a good venue (restaurant, office space, etc..) or have an employer who would let us use a conference room at night?

        As for location for the first few meetings I am going to try and swap back and forth between Bellevue/Eastside and Seattle to see if there is enough people on both sides of the lake to warrant meetings, etc&#8230; Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts.

        Thanks,
        Mike de Libero
