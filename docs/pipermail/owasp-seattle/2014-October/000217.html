<PRE>Howdy Everyone!

	I am going to try and get a OWASP Seattle chapter meet-up setup in the coming weeks / month. But if possible I would love some help. If anyone has ideas / input / leads for any of the following things I would greatly appreciate it.

- What topics / talks would we like to see happen at this meeting or in future ones?
- Does anyone wish to speak and/or know someone who wants to give a presentation?
- Does anyone know of a good venue (restaurant, office space, etc..) or have an employer who would let us use a conference room at night? 

	As for location for the first few meetings I am going to try and swap back and forth between Bellevue/Eastside and Seattle to see if there is enough people on both sides of the lake to warrant meetings, etc&#8230; Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts. 

	Thanks,
	Mike de Libero
</PRE>
