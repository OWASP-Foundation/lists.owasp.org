&gt;<i> Ok, I got some details on what we presentations we will see at this OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> meeting!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, we will actually have two presenters.   First, Jim Manico will be
</I>&gt;<i> joining us via Skype:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Top Ten Web Defenses
</I>&gt;<i> We cannot &#8220;firewall&#8221; or &#8220;patch&#8221; our way to secure websites. In the past,
</I>&gt;<i> security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
</I>&gt;<i> patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
</I>&gt;<i> methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
</I>&gt;<i> well-protected websites are occurring every day. Most every organization
</I>&gt;<i> in the world have something in common &#8211; they have had websites
</I>&gt;<i> compromised in some way. No company or industry is immune. Programmers
</I>&gt;<i> need to learn to build websites differently. This talk will review the
</I>&gt;<i> top coding techniques developers need to master in order to build a
</I>&gt;<i> low-risk, high-security web application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BIO: Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat
</I>&gt;<i> Security, a web security firm. He authors and delivers developer
</I>&gt;<i> security awareness training for WhiteHat Security and has a background
</I>&gt;<i> building software as a developer and architect for over 20 years. Jim is
</I>&gt;<i> also a global board member for the OWASP foundation where he helps drive
</I>&gt;<i> the strategic vision for the organization. He manages and participates
</I>&gt;<i> in several OWASP projects, including the OWASP cheat sheet series and
</I>&gt;<i> several additional secure coding projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After that, we have Brad Hill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Title: &quot;HTML5 Security Realities&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract: It's almost conventional wisdom in the security biz that HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> is a nightmare of unnecessary complexity and attack surface, but should you
</I>&gt;<i> believe the hype?  Brad challenges those notions in this talk with a report
</I>&gt;<i> on the state of security in the modern browser and shows how to use
</I>&gt;<i> emerging standards to solve some of the big problems of Web security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bio: Brad Hill is an iSEC alum at PayPal, where he does security research
</I>&gt;<i> and standards development, including serving as the co-chair of the Web
</I>&gt;<i> Application Security Working Group at the W3C.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello everybody!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry for the short notice, but we now have a meet up happening in June!
</I>&gt;<i>  June 4th we will be at the UW.  I have Brad Hill from paypal joining us.
</I>&gt;<i>  I don't have all the details yet but I will send a note out when I have
</I>&gt;<i> him.  I do know that Brad is a noted speaker and extremely knowledgable
</I>&gt;<i> with application security.  I am super excited to have him.
