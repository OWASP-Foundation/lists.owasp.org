Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] [Owasp-world] Securing file upload
Message-ID: <08F4D210068DF34CB60F46AC80E0147614CBBA@crpex04.icicibankltd.com>

I am using a .NET application, in which there is a feature
to upload files (.doc .xls) onto the server. How do I ensure
that the end user is uploading only permitted file type(s) &
not files containing any malicious code which can lead to
the compromise of the server? Please suggest security
measures that should be taken to avoid any such unwanted
upload.

Subject: [OWASP-Seattle] Lineup for Next OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <3563.24.16.205.170.1125011797.squirrel@webmail.owasp.org>

I hope everyone had an enjoyable summer break.  I'm pleased to announce we
have two excellent speakers lined up for the next OWASP meeting on Oct
6th. IOActive Inc will be sponsoring the meeting and Akshay Agarwal will
discuss Rapid Threat Modeling for those who did not see this presentation
at the recent Black Hat show in Las Vegas. Also on the agenda, a veteran
of the Microsoft ACE Team, Eric Rachner, will demonstrate One-Click
Attacks. Information on the next meeting has been updated on the Seattle
OWASP web page.  https://portal.owasp.org/local/seattle.html

I hope to see everyone at this upcoming event. Please give me a call if
you have questions.

-Todd

**************************************************************

Everyone with an interest in applicaton security is welcome to join our
chapter meetings. The next meeting will be held Thursday night October 6th
at the following location and is sponsored by IOActive Inc.
(www.IOActive.com)

Las Margaritas Restaurant
437 108th Avenue NE (corner of NE 4th & 108th)
Bellevue, WA 98004
tel: (425) 453-0535

Appetizers, beer and wine will be served and vegetarian items are provided
at all events. The meeting will be held in a private meeting room at Las
Margaritas.

Feature Presentation: Rapid Threat Modeling

One of the most important weapons in our arsenal for securing applications
is threat modeling. Applications are becoming increasingly complex and new
technologies are emerging constantly. In this scenario, building or
attacking applications is challenging. Threat models can help attackers
discover design vulnerabilities and mount complex attacks. These models
give secure application developers a great amount of leverage to envision
their design, implementation and soundness of their architectures. Being
living documents, they also carry forward any knowledge gained from
previous development life cycles and are invaluable in understanding the
impact of any changes to the overall security posture of the applications.
Understanding and constructing meaningful threat models is hard.
Application teams and attackers need to be aware of what they want to
model, how they want to model and when they want to model. Rapid Threat
Modeling will help them develop models rapidly while reutilizing data they
gathered either through reconnaissance or through the software development
lifecycle. A practical hands-on demonstration of modeling threats for
complex managed application will allow for immediate use of any threat
modeling knowledge gained.

Featured Speaker: Akshay Aggarwal

Akshay Aggarwal currently works for IOActive Inc. as a computer security
consultant where he is responsible for conducting security architecture
design, application and source-code assessments and vulnerability
research. He helps Fortune 100 clients evaluate the security of their
software products and applications and develop threat models. He has
authored several research papers and been invited to speak at many forums
like the Multi-University Research Initiative for Protocol Development and
the Center for Information Technology Research in Interest of Society.
Akshay holds a MS in Computer Science from the University of California at
Davis. There, at the renowned Computer Security Lab, he conducted research
on Internet worms and Intrusion detection systems.

2nd Presentation: One Click Attacks

The term "one-click attack" describes a technique whereby an attacker can
cause another user to unwittingly transmit HTTP requests of the attacker's
choice. This brief presentation will demonstrate a fairly advanced example
of the one-click attack, explore alternate attack scenarios, and discuss
prevention techniques.

Presenter: Eric Rachner

Eric Rachner is a freelance computer security professional and long-time
security enthusiast. His interest in the subject dates back to his teen
years and throughout a 10-year career at Microsoft where he most recently
held the position of Senior Security Analyst. Working in that capacity for
three years gave Eric a particular specialty in Web application security
as well as the opportunity to contribute a cover feature on the subject
for the August 2004 issue of asp.net PRO Magazine. He has also contributed
material on .NET-based Web applications to the Microsoft .NET Developer
book series.

Note: OWASP does not endorse products or services in any way. Information
provided at chapter meetings is in the interest of the members of the
OWASP Seattle chapter.

Meeting Agenda:

6pm to 6:30pm - Reception (food & beverages)
6:30pm to 6:40pm - Chapter Announcements
6:45pm to 7:45pm - Presentation -Threat Modeling
