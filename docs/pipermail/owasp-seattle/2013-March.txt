Hey Everybody,

So we are working on plans or another OWASP meeting.  What I am looking
for now, is a venue.  We are thinking second week of april.  Anybody
work someplace that would be willing to host?  I am definitely looking
at some of you that have hosted before (e.g. Adobe, F5, Amazon, etc. ) ;-)

Thanks!
-Raymond
