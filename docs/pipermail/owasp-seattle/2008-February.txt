Subject: [Owasp-seattle] Next OWASP Seattle Chapter Meeting - 3/4/08
Message-ID: <D699EECF-ED40-4854-A108-6AA61688E216@mde-dev.com>

Hello,

	We have planned our next OWASP Seattle chapter meeting.  It will be  
held at 6:30PM on Tuesday March 4th (3/4/2008).  Below is the  
information about the speakers for this meeting.  It looks like it  
should be a good one.  Please let us know if you are able to make it  
so we can get order enough food and drinks.

Speaker: Billy Rios
Bad Sushi - Beating Phishers at Their Own Game
This talk will expose tactics and tools used by phishers, show how  
easy it is to hack into servers that are used to perform phishing,  
demonstrate how easy it is so follow a phsisher's trail to find out  
how they share information on US Citizens including SSNs, bank account  
numbers, credit card numbers, ATM PINs, you name it.
Phishers usually setup their sites on servers they have compromised.  
In other words, the phishers have already done the hard work and it is  
easy to gain access to these servers. Due to the sheer volume of sites  
that need to be setup to perform a successful phish, phishers tend to  
be sloppy and leave traces everywhere.
This talk will expose some of the tactics and tools used by phishers.  
Actual walk-through of how compromised hosts were accessed to gain  
information about the phishers will be presented. This talk will also  
show how easy it is to construct a trail from a compromised host to  
obtain information about individuals that is spewed on hacker message  
boards located outside the United States.

Billy Rios lives in a phish bowl and is constantly being sent emails  
from acquaintances all over the world. Billy has won the Internet  
lotto several times, is expecting large sums of abandoned money from a  
long lost relative in the Congo, and has received checks accidentally  
made out for 30,000 instead of 30 US dollars.

Speaker: Jon McClintock
Session management is one of the most overlooked areas of web  
application security, and yet it can also be the most challenging  
feature to get right in your web application. This talk will provide a  
brief overview of web session management, followed by an exposition  
into how several common web application frameworks implement session  
management, finishing with a discussion of several classes of  
vulnerabilities that can arise through poor session management.
Jon McClintock is a Senior Consultant for Leviathan Security Group,  
where he specializes in application security from design through  
implementation and into deployment. Prior to Leviathan, Jon was a  
Senior Software Engineer on Amazon.com's Information Security team,  
where he worked with software teams to define security requirements,  
assess application security, and educate developers about security  
software best practices.
