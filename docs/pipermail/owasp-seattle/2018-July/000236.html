<PRE>We're having an evening meeting in Downtown Seattle on Thursday, July 26,
2018 at Extrahop

Four speakers:

Integrated security testing: finding security vulnerabilities using your
existing test framework

Morgan Roman
<A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-roman/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-roman/</A>

Having a dedicated suite of a continuously run security tests seems out of
reach for all but the most mature security programs. Scanners only scratch
the surface or your application. Many companies already have integration
tests that snake their way deeply into their web application, covering
nearly every workflow.

In this talk, we will use a minimal amount of work to transform these
integration tests into a suite of security tests.

Using Selenium and ZAP we will repurpose integration tests into security
tests to search for common web application flaws such as XSS and SQLi with
more context than a scanner. These security tests will traverse the web
application the same way a real user would. We will then extend these tests
to find subtle security bugs in authorization and business logic.

This session is ideal for testers and developers interested in making
security testing part of their continuous integration pipeline.

Pacu: a modular open source Amazon Web Services post exploitation attack
tool

Spencer Gietzen
<A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-gietzen/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-gietzen/</A>

Cloud infrastructure security and configuration has been shown to be a
difficult task to master. Sysadmins and developers with years of
traditional IT experience are now being pushed to the cloud, where there is
a whole new set of rules. This is what makes AWS environments particularly
exciting to attack as a penetration tester. Best practices are often
overlooked or ignored, which can leave gaps throughout an AWS environment
that are ripe for exploitation.With an increasing number of breaches
leaking AWS secret keys, companies are working to be proactive and are
looking for red-team-like post exploitation penetration tests, so that they
can be sure that their client data is as safe as possible post-breach.

Due to this need and the lack of AWS specific attack tools, I wrote Pacu, a
modular, open source Amazon Web Services post exploitation attack tool
created and used for Rhino Security Labs pentests.

In this talk I'll give an overview of how red teamers can use Pacu to
simulate real-world attack scenarios against AWS environments, starting
from information enumeration and scanning through exploitation, privilege
escalation, data exfiltration and even providing reporting documentation.
It will be released early August as an open source project to encourage
collaboration and discussion of different AWS attack techniques and
methodologies with both attackers and defenders.

[[ the third one ]]

Entropy
Jeff Costlow
<A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffcostlow/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffcostlow/</A>

Entropy is a measurement of the amount of randomness in a system. All
systems need entropy to run in a secure fashion. We'll do a deep dive into
entropy; what entropy is, how it's used, and how it's generated and kept in
a pool in the linux kernel. We'll also give some important safety tips.

[[ the fourth one ]]

Business problems suited for a blockchain solution
Ashok Misra
<A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paymentsnut/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/paymentsnut/</A>

Are there particularly good business problems suited for a blockchain
solution ?

Blockchain technology is evolving at an exponential rate. There are
numerous companies and projects claiming to be disrupting whichever space
they claim to be disrupting.

However, is blockchain a panacea for all business problems ? This talk will
drill into some atomic details of the technology with a view towards
understanding what can possibly be disrupted.
