Message-ID: <20070108083852.8h21eb3gg4o8gg8w@webmail.mde-dev.com>

   Good morning!  So, Brad from ISec partners had a scheduling  
conflict that was not noticed until the last moment and will not be  
joining us tonight :(.  To replace that Scott and I will be talking  
about the Seattle chapter priorities, what feedback we have received  
and any other ideas you might have.

   If anyone wishes not to attend because of this change please let me  
know so I can update the count for the right amount of food.

   I apologize for the short notice on this change.  Please let me  
know if you have any further questions.

   Thanks,
   Mike de Libero

Subject: [Owasp-seattle] Lets find some bugs!
Message-ID: <45AD1A91.80900@mde-dev.com>

Hello,

    So I am planning a night where we go do an assessment on an open 
source application and maybe have a few beers (or whatever you prefer).  
But, I would like to give everyones opinion before nailing down the 
details.  Here are my tentative plans.

Apps to assess:
  - Mediawiki (we will log the bugs anonymously if any are found)
  - An example site through the OWASP SiteGenerator (This will be easier 
and for people who want to get some practice in)
 
Where:
  - Prost! (http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/10774483).  Why? 
Because they have good beer and free wifi..

When:
  - Some Saturday night (anyone have objections to that night??)

What to bring:
  - A laptop if you have it
  - A good attitude

What not to bring:
  - Over-inflated egos :)

    I will setup a box for us to assess mediawiki against as long as no 
one actually attacks the server and not the actual app :). 

    The reason I want to do this is so that we can all learn different 
tools and methodologies that we each use and also for some of the newer 
people in the field to learn from the more experienced people (and maybe 
vice-versa) and so we can all meet new people in this field.

    Well let me know your thoughts and if you would like to see this happen.

    Thanks,
    Mike de Libero
    OWASP Seattle Chapter co-leader

Hello,

    There seems to be some confusion (I must not have had caffeine 
before I sent it out :)). 

    *I have yet to set a date*.  I am just looking to see if people are 
interested in doing this type of thing and if they have any objections 
to going to a place list Prost!.

    I apologize for any confusion. 

    Thanks,

Hello Owasp Seattle

In principle I will be in seattle on the week of the 12th of Feb and was
wondering if you wanted to set up an event.

I can do a presentation on OWASP,  present my latest .Net research on
'Buffer Overflows on the .Net Framework'  or pick talk about another topic
from my Black Hat 'Advanced Asp.Net Exploits and Countermeasures' course
http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-usa-06/train-bh-us-06-io-net.html   (you
pick :)  )

Let me know what you think

sounds good too. How much time do we have? =-P

Hello,

    Just to keep everyone in the loop on what is going on for the next 
meeting.  The tentative plans are for it to be on Thursday 2/15/07. 
Dinis wants two hours of talking time and we will have at least one 
other presentation.  So, everyone mark your calendars and I will be 
sending out the official information in a few days ...hopefully :). 

    Thanks,

Message-ID: <45B6EDE1.7010902@mde-dev.com>

Hello,

Well it sounds like we have a good line up for this month's OWASP 
Seattle Chapter meeting. Please RSVP to this email so we can make sure 
to order enough food and cerveza for everyone ;). Details for meeting 
are as follows:

Location: Bellevue Las Margaritas (http://www.lasmargaritasbellevue.com/)
Time: 6 o?clock.

Speakers:
* Dinis Cruz (Chief OWASP Evangelist) - Directly from London, Dinis will 
be doing two presentations at this event:
o Buffer Overflows on .Net and Asp.Net - One of the common myths about 
the .Net Framework is that it is immune to buffer overflows. Although 
this might be correct in pure managed and verifiable .Net code, large 
percentage of .Net and Asp.Net applications code is unmanaged. In this 
talk Dinis will show the areas in .Net and Asp.Net applications that are 
vulnerable to buffer overflows (including the demo of a .Net Buffer 
Overflow Fuzzer).
o OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project - The Open Web 
Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to 
enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications 
that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, blogs, and 
chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application 
security. In this presentation Dinis will show the latest guides and 
tools from OWASP which should be part of every company's security efforts.

* Brad Hill (Senior Security Consultant with iSEC Partners), will be 
speaking on:
o XML Digital Signature and Encryption: Use and Abuse - The WS-Security 
set of standards is on the threshold of ubiquitous deployment and XML 
applications have already taken over the world. This presentation looks 
at two underlying technologies, XML Digital Signature (XMLDSIG) and XML 
Encryption (XMLENC), their place in the Web Services stack and their 
applicability to non-SOAP XML applications. Beginning with a basic 
overview of the standards, we will uncover some surprising caveats and 
risks in the use of these technologies.

Once again please let me know if you are planning on attending. We are 
looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Thanks,
Mike de Libero & Scott Stender

Hi

I have some bad news (and some possible good news).

Due to a change of plans I will not going to Seattle on the week of the 12th
of Feb (the bad news) but will be going there two weeks later, i.e. the week
of Feb 26th (the good news)

So if you guys can, I would ask that we moved the presentations to that week

Sorry for this
