Hi Everyone,

	I was wondering if anyone was interested in having an informal happy hour type meet-up here in Seattle or Bellevue? If there is any interest I will figure out the venue and send out the invite.

I'm interested.  I even have some things to talk about.

I'd prefer Seattle.  Even better if we can get some of the Citysec people
in on it.

Howdy Everyone!

	I am going to try and get a OWASP Seattle chapter meet-up setup in the coming weeks / month. But if possible I would love some help. If anyone has ideas / input / leads for any of the following things I would greatly appreciate it.

- What topics / talks would we like to see happen at this meeting or in future ones?
- Does anyone wish to speak and/or know someone who wants to give a presentation?
- Does anyone know of a good venue (restaurant, office space, etc..) or have an employer who would let us use a conference room at night? 

	As for location for the first few meetings I am going to try and swap back and forth between Bellevue/Eastside and Seattle to see if there is enough people on both sides of the lake to warrant meetings, etc? Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts. 

	Thanks,
	Mike de Libero

Hello,

I recently heard that the Pacific Northwest OWASP chapter getting started through meetups and I wanted to reach out to whoever is most appropriate about speaking opportunities. I?m a technical manager here at Cigital and based down in Orange County and am an active participant in the chapter down here. I?ve got talks that I?ve delivered and some that are almost ready to roll out on both the attack and defense side and I?d be more than happy to come up and speak with Cigital sponsorship at a chapter meeting on any of the following if there is interest, let me know!

Building a red teaming capability into a security program
Designing a secure mobile game virtual economy
Next generation red teaming ? focusing on an expanded scope and bridging the gap between detection and attack

I could always do a case study like preso from some of the crazy things I?ve had to work on over time: game console hacking, setting up continuous scanning capabilities, reverse engineering white-box crypto protected apps, etc.

Let me know!

Rob

Mike,
Might have an available space in Bellevue at the Group Health facility off of NE 8th. My boss should be sending me information on how to reserve after hour rooms.

Greetings,

I just relocated to the Seattle area and I am a new member of the
chapter. I may be able to offer meeting space in Bellevue. Would
anyone be interested in meeting during the day, possibly during the
lunch hour?

I am also a project contributor on the OWASP Mobile Top Ten project.
We are in the midst of a significant effort to get ready for an
updated list for 2015. If you are interested I could present on the
current top ten and the status and direction of the project.

Thanks,

Chad Butler
