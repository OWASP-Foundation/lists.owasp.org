How OWASP Works and Guided Tour of OWASP Projects

Speaker: Dinis Cruz

This presentation will focus on my experience in getting things done at
OWASP, what resources are available and what types of initiatives should the
local chapters be doing. In addition to a quick overview of a number of key
OWASP projects, this talk will also provide a tutorial on how the OWASP WIKI
(MediaWiki based) can be used as a database (using the MediaWiki templates
technology)

  _____  

Using the O2 Platform to Consume OWASP projects

Speaker: Dinis Cruz

This presentation will focus on how to consume the OWASP Wiki and a number
of OWASP projects using the OWASP O2 Platform. The O2 Platform has powerful
technology and capabilities for both BlackBox and WhiteBox analysis and this
presentation will provide examples on how to use O2 with: WebGoat,
WebScarab, Code Crawler, Dir Buster, Testing Guide, Code Review Guide and
OpenSAMM


The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge and
workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough
'source-code-driven' application security reviews (BlackBox + WhiteBox). In
addition to the manual findings created/discovered by security consultants,
the OWASP O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of results from multiple
OWASP projects and commercial scanning tools. This allows security
consultants to find, exploit and automate (via Unit Tests) security
vulnerabilities usually dismissed by the community as impossible to
find/recreate. More importantly, it provides the Security Consultants a
mechanism to: a) 'talk' with developers (via UnitTest) , b) give developers
a way to replicate + &quot;check if it's fixed&quot; the vulnerabilities reported and
c) engage on a two-way conversion on the best way to fix/remediate those
vulnerabilities.

Dinis Cruz is a Security Consultant based in London (UK) and specialized in:
ASP.NET/J2EE Application Security, Application Security audits and .NET
Security Curriculum Development.

For the past years Dinis has focused on the field of Static Source Code
analysis, from May 2007 to Dec 2009 he worked as a independent consultant
for Ounce Labs (bought by IBM in July 2009) where during active security
engagements using Ounce's technology he developed the Open Source codebase
which now is the foundation of the OWASP O2 Platform.

Dinis is currently focused on making the O2 Platform the industry standard
for consuming, instrumenting and data-sharing between the multiple WebAppSec
tools, the Security consultants and the final developers.

Dinis is a also active trainer on .Net security having written and delivered
courses for IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG (at multiple
locations including BlackHat), and has delivered a number of presentations
and keynote speeches at multiple OWASP and Security related conferences

At OWASP, Dinis is the leader of the OWASP O2 Platform project
