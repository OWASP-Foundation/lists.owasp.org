Hi All!

In just over a month AppSec EU is taking place in Belfast. There's so much
going on - talks, women in appsec networking evenings and breakfast, traing
opprotunities, workshops and so much more. Take a look:
https://2017.appsec.eu/

We're also in the process in ogganizing our next a local meet-up - so... if
you have any talks you would like to give, please let us know, we'd love to
hear from you.

Fiona and Darren @ the OWASP Cork chapter!
