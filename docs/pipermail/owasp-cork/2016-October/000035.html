<PRE>Hi all,

Our next chapter meeting is on October 10th and will be delivered by Owen
Pendlebury.

Join us for some AppSec talk and pizza.

*Register here: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/234599973/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/234599973/</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/234599973/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/234599973/</A>&gt;*

In what promises to be an interesting evening, Owen is going to talk to us
about the anatomy of an attack:


*Stories of organisations getting hacked are becoming so frequent that it
would be easy to believe that there&#8217;s no real way to avoid being the next
target. I will outline what we know, what incident data tells us and what
the typical motive is behind these hacks. Furthermore, I will walk you
through the three stages of an attack (footprinting, scanning and
exploitation) and discuss some recent hacks and what we can learn from
them. *

Bio:

Owen has been involved in the OWASP Foundation since 2009. He has been an
active and dedicated chapter leader, who has organised regular activities
for the OWASP Dublin chapter that benefit the local information security
community greatly over the past 7 years. Some of the projects that Owen has
been involved in include, AppSec EU 2016/ 2017 Committee/ Training
Committee chair, AppSec EU 2017 successful bid, DaggerCon, Cyber Startup
Summit, Source Dublin, Advanced Threat Intelligence Seminars and numerous
security workshops.

Owen is currently a manager in Deloitte Ireland and has over 7 years&#8217;
penetration testing experience, working as part of a global attack &amp;
penetration team for a number organisations including a &#8220;Big 4&#8221;
professional services company. With in-depth experience of application and
network penetration testing Owen has worked with many local and global
institutions to improve their security posture.

Owen has also been involved in local education bodies, architecting a
masters in cyber security and helping a number of students and experienced
individuals find their way into the security community by making himself
available to them through all media.

*Afterwards ...*

We might have a few sneaky pints afterwards, and you are all welcome to
join us for a chat about all things AppSec.

We are having the talks upstairs in the Roundy Bar on Castle Street so we
will stay on there.

Looking forward to seeing you there,
Darren &amp; Fiona (OWASP Cork Team)

Fiona Collins,
