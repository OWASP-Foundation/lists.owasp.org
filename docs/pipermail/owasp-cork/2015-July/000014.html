<PRE>Hi all,

Tuesday July 28 will see the third of our free series of workshops based on
 the OWASP Top 10 (2013) <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10.</A> This month
we will be looking at Injection flaws which are #1 in the top 10. This is
the top item as successful exploitation can lead to complete control of
your systems by a malicious user.

We will also be having our summer social event, with some free food and
beer, after the talks - see below for more details.

Initially we will discuss how to identify injection vulnerabilities in your
application, highlight the risks associated with injection flaws, provide
some mitigation techniques and demonstrate how this all works.

We will then go on to invoke our learning from the first phase and put it
to practical use. We take our testing environment and use it to exploit
some injection vulnerabilities on a safe, intentionally vulnerable website.

Full details and registration on our meet-up page:
<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/223564914/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/223564914/</A>

After the workshop we will go along to the Woolshed bar where we would like
to treat you to some food, drinks and chats: (

Hope to see you there!

Darren &amp; Fiona (OWASP Cork Team)

Note: During the previous workshops we set up our machines.

Anyone who has set up their machines during the last workshop can continue
to use that and will have all tools in place, but if you have not, no
problem, we can just set up the one or two main tools that we will need for
that night. If you would like some assistance in getting set-up then we
will be there from 18:45 to help. Alternatively, you can contact one of the
organisers (Fiona or Darren) in advance and we will let you know what you
need.

If you would like to have ZAP installed on your machine you can get it
here: ZAP Install &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads">https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads</A>&gt;. Having
a machine isn't a requirement for attending, there will be talks and demos
as well as the practical elements.

Fiona Collins,
OWASP Cork Chapter Lead
