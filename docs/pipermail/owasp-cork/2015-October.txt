Subject: [Owasp-cork] Final OWASP Top 10 Workshop - 15 Oct 2015
Message-ID: <CAAuXVS5svxiWU-oEK+KUYY5Kv=ByU0YdHRTcZ2adpsqbY-20bw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,



On Thursday, October 15th, we are holding the last of our free series of
workshops based on OWASP's most well known flagship project, the OWASP Top
10 (2013) https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10. The goal of these
workshops is to learn by doing, which is usually the best approach to
learning anything. In that light, we will speak a little about each of the
areas from the Top 10, then take that learning to the next level by
attacking vulnerable sites and investigating vulnerable code and
configurations.


*Register to attend
here: http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/225847811/
<http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/225847811/>*



Note: During the previous workshops we set up our machines to be ready for
web penetration testing. Anyone who has done this can continue as such, but
if you have not, no problem, we can help you set up the one or two main
tools that we will need for that night. That should only take a couple of
minutes. If you would like some assistance in getting set-up then we will
be there from 18:45 to help. Alternatively, you can contact one of the
organisers (Fiona or Darren) in advance and we will let you know what you
need.



If you would like to have ZAP installed on your machine you can get it
here: ZAP Install. Having a machine isn't a requirement for attending,
there will be talks and demos as well as the practical elements.


This month's workshop will be divided into three phases:



*1. Top 10 2013 - A5 - Security Misconfiguration *



*Delivered by: Fiona Collins*



Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of an application stack,
including the platform, web server, application server, database,
framework, and custom code. Developers and system administrators need to
work together to ensure that the entire stack is configured properly.
Automated scanners are useful for detecting missing patches,
misconfigurations, use of default accounts, unnecessary services, etc.,
however these should not be relied upon.



https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A5-Security_Misconfiguration



*2. Top 10 2013 - A2 - Broken Authentication and Session Management*


*Delivered by: Darren Fitzpatrick*



Developers frequently build custom authentication and session management
schemes, but building these correctly is hard. As a result, these custom
schemes frequently have flaws in areas such as logout, password management,
timeouts, remember me, secret question, account update, etc. Finding such
flaws can sometimes be difficult, as each implementation is unique.



https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A2-Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management



*3. Top 10 2013 - A6 - Sensitive Data Exposure*



*Delivered by: Fiona Collins*



The most common flaw is simply not encrypting sensitive data. When crypto
is employed, weak key generation and management, and weak algorithm usage
is common, particularly weak password hashing techniques. Browser
weaknesses are very common and easy to detect, but hard to exploit on a
large scale. External attackers have difficulty detecting server side flaws
due to limited access and they are also usually hard to exploit.



https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A6-Sensitive_Data_Exposure



*4. Practical Hands On Workshop *



This section of the night will invoke our learning from the first phase and
put it to practical use. We take our testing environment and use it to
exploit some of both types of vulnerabilities on a safe, intentionally
vulnerable website.



After giving some time for individually attempting to carry out the
exploitation, a walk-through of the exploit technique will be given for
each of the examples outlined. The OWASP team will be at hand to help with
any issues that might arise through this phase.



The practical elements will allow you attack a vulnerable site from a
malicious attacker or software tester's perspective. You will leave with
not only an understanding of the issues but also having had hands on
practice.



Chapter meetings are provided free of charge although OWASP membership is
encouraged and besides supporting the organisation, will provide the holder
with benefits in other areas such as free/discounted entry to conferences,
etc.



Hope to see you there!

Subject: [Owasp-cork] Cork Chapter Meeting: PCI DSS Pen Testing / IAM -
 Thursday, November 12, 2015
Message-ID: <CAAuXVS5TLAXT7B-608q8WtpsUmozzCpXOHv5X_XstiV7Q6YMYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

On Thursday November 12th we have two great speakers lined up for our next
chapter meeting. Both posses great experience in their respective areas, so
can get across the information and answer your questions that might not be
so easy to find in the books. Stephen O'Boyle will talk about PCI DSS
(Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standard), the set of compliance
guidelines that you must adhere to if you store, transmit or process credit
card information. This will be followed up with Barry Mulcahy's valuable
information on management of identity and access to data across systems.

Also, thanks to the kind sponsorship from Espion on the night there will be
some food and drinks provided too. No doubt, this should be a great night :)

*Register here: http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/226255568/
<http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/226255568/> *

*Talk #1 - PCI DSS v3.1 Scanning and Penetration Testing*

Stephen will discuss the key changes in PCI DSS Version 3.1, examine
penetration testing methodology from the auditor?s point of view, and how
you can maintain compliance.

Key Takeaways will include

?  PCI DSS Pentest / Scanning overview

?  Migrating from V2 to V3.1

?  Changes to penetration testing requirement 11.3

?  Scanning vs pen testing

?  What the auditor expects from pen testing

?  Example methodology

*Speaker Bio:*

Stephen O?Boyle heads up Espion?s Professional Services team and has been a
PCI Qualified Security Assessor since 2008. He is an experienced
information security, risk and compliance consultant with has over ten
years? experience in information security in both domestic and
international markets. Stephen has extensive experience in performing PCI
audits / consultancy, information security & risk management assessments,
network / architecture security reviews, application security reviews,
penetration testing and assisting organisations in aligning their
information security posture to their business objectives. Stephen has
worked across a wide range of industry verticals, including government,
financial, education and technology.

*Talk #2 - Identity and Access Management (IAM)*

This talk will focus on Identity and Access Management (IAM), what it is
and how it fits into the security landscape. It will outline the lifecycle
of an identity (Hello new hire Alice!). How we move from having an identity
to having access. Some of the common pitfalls encountered during IAM
integration projects. Analytics techniques for IAM that smooth the
integration path, validate controls and provide valuable Business
Intelligence (BI) that are useful for process improvement and security
auditing. The talk will conclude by looking at some of the recent trends in
IAM and some pointers for the future.

*Speaker Bio:*

Barry P. Mulcahy received a B.Sc. in computer science from UCC in 2001 and
a Ph.D. in distributed security systems from UCC in 2008. His academic
experience involves R&D in distributed security systems with an emphasis on
data aggregation, analytics and workflows. While working in Waterford IT as
a security researcher he was involved in several large European FP7
projects including CoMiFin, EternalS and Aniketos. His commercial roles
include Identity and Access Management (IAM) Project Manager at
Onaware-Mycroft. This boutique IAM integration house catered primarily for
financial institutions. Barry is currently part of the Qualcomm Web
Authentication team, helping design and implement security controls for
authentication and authorization in Qualcomm?s global IT infrastructure.

*Afterwards ...*

We* might* have a few sneaky pints afterwards, and you are all welcome to
join us.

We are having the talks in Cashman's Bar on Academy Street so we will stay
on there.

Regards,

Darren & Fiona (OWASP Cork Team)
