Subject: [Owasp-cork] Source Conference Discount Code
Message-ID: <CAAuXVS75eeJXYLNMpetA-W+oC9w1s38q7nU29hjH_qAQawPcRg@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,

The OWASP Cork chapter has received a discount code for the SOURCE Dublin
conference taking place in September. Details below.

The SOURCE Conference specializes in bringing business, technology and
security professionals together to discuss practical solutions to
real-world problems. Established in 2008, the SOURCE Conference provides a
unique environment for learning, networking, and exchanging ideas and
solutions for today?s information security challenges.

*World-class Agenda*
SOURCE gets some of the best speakers in the world, and this year is no
exception. We have an excellent selection of speakers lined up, and we hope
to see you there. The main conference is being held on 7-8 September, and
we will be announcing our complete list of speakers and topics within the
week at: http://www.sourceconference.com/#!dublin-2015-agenda/c1v2w

*Special Pricing*
This has been an exciting year as Big Brain Security takes over running all
three SOURCE events. To celebrate our reboot, we are having a special
summer sale effective immediately.

General admission ticket prices for SOURCE Dublin will be reduced to ?199
(from ?495) for the month of August only.

Likewise, the 1-day price for training seats will drop from ?995 to ?495
for the Dublin event. All trainings include a ticket to the SOURCE
Conference.

This is our little way of saying thanks for supporting our events. Prices
will revert to standard pre-registration pricing on September 1, 2015

We are pleased to offer an additional 25% discount for the conference and
trainings to members of OWASP Ireland Chapters.

Use the registration code: *OWASP2015GA* to receive an additional 25%
discount off the ticket price.

*Local Infosec Training!*
This year we are hosting an Application Security Risk for Business course
taught by Rob Cheyne, CEO, Big Brain Security. This course is designed for
managers and executives on the business side of the house, and is an
excellent course for learning about the underlying application security
risks that every business must deal with, as well as what can be done to
help best support the technical teams in doing so. Rob has taught
information security topics to over 25,000 students around the world, and
is an authority on shifting mindsets around security. More info here:

Don?t forget! All trainings include a free ticket to the SOURCE Conference
on 7-8 September, and a training ticket is your VIP entry to the full
SOURCE experience. Training seats are limited, so register now to reserve
your spot.

Fiona Collins,
OWASP Cork Chapter Lead
