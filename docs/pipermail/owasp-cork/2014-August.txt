Subject: [Owasp-cork] Chapter Meeting - September 2nd

Hi all,

Welcome to the Cork OWASP Chapter mailing list.

We are delighted to announce our first chapter meeting taking place place
on Tuesday September 1st upstairs in SoHo bar on Grand Parade. This meeting
is a joint event with the CorkSec group (http://www.meetup.com/CorkSec/).
We would love if you could stay around after for a chat and some networking.

Register for the event here:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/203006902/

There are two talks lined up:

*Talk 1: Web to Shell by Darren Fitzpatrick*

Darren will introduce the concept of getting a shell through a website.
This basically means remotely taking over the server on which a web
application is installed. After a little theory, he will go about
delivering demonstrations of this in action. Demos will include common
attack vectors of this type and one recent and quite common ruby on rails
specific remote exploit.



*Talk 2: How I got into Security by Jack Baylor *

In this short talk I'll be covering:

* my education and previous work experience
* what courses I wish I'd covered but didn't
* how I got interested initially
* how I started researching and networking
* how I came about working in Qualcomm
* how some others broke into security (through polling others here and
through talking to people on LinkedIn etc...),
* what courses I intend to take in the next 1, 2 and 5 years
Doors open at 19:00, talks start around 19:15

Hope to see you there,

Fiona & Darren

P.S. Watch this space for details of our first solo chapter meeting later
in the month in what will hopefully be our new home for chapter meetings!
