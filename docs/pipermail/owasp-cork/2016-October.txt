Subject: [Owasp-Cork] Chapter Meeting - October 10: The Anatomy of an Attack
Message-ID: <CAAuXVS6Oyg0t5Qdsz7RnR5yVwFR6A1tsXK4aT9J8q5k4KJd8gA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Our next chapter meeting is on October 10th and will be delivered by Owen
Pendlebury.

Join us for some AppSec talk and pizza.

*Register here: https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/234599973/
<https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cork/events/234599973/>*

In what promises to be an interesting evening, Owen is going to talk to us
about the anatomy of an attack:


*Stories of organisations getting hacked are becoming so frequent that it
would be easy to believe that there?s no real way to avoid being the next
target. I will outline what we know, what incident data tells us and what
the typical motive is behind these hacks. Furthermore, I will walk you
through the three stages of an attack (footprinting, scanning and
exploitation) and discuss some recent hacks and what we can learn from
them. *
