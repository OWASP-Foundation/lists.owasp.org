Call for Papers



Introduction

There is a change in the information systems development paradigm. The
emergence of Web 2.0 technologies led to the extensive deployment and use of
web-based applications and web services as a way to developed new and
flexible information systems. Such systems are easy to develop, deploy and
maintain and demonstrate impressive features for users, resulting in their
current wide use.

As a result of this paradigm shift, the security requirements have also
changed. These web-based information systems have different security
requirements, when compared to traditional systems. Important security
issues have been found and privacy concerns have also been raised recently.
In addition, the emerging Cloud Computing paradigm promises even greater
flexibility; however corresponding security and privacy issues still need to
be examined. The security environment should involve not only the
surrounding environment but also the application core.

This conference aims to bring together application security experts,
researchers, educators and practitioners from the industry, academia and
international communities such as OWASP, in order to discuss open problems
and new solutions in application security. In the context of this track
academic researchers will be able to combine interesting results with the
experience of practitioners and software engineers.



Conference Topics

Suggested topics for papers submission include (but are not limited to):

&#8226; Secure application development

&#8226; Security of service oriented architectures &#8226; Security of development
frameworks &#8226; Threat modelling of web applications &#8226; Cloud computing security

static analysis etc.) &#8226; Metrics for application security &#8226; Countermeasures
for web application vulnerabilities &#8226; Secure coding techniques &#8226; Platform or

Paper Submission Instructions

Authors should submit an original paper in English, carefully checked for
correct grammar and spelling, using the on-line submission procedure (
<A HREF="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ibwas10">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ibwas10</A>). Please check the paper
formats so you may be aware of the accepted paper page limits (12 pages, in
accordance to a supplied template:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/word/LNCS-Office2007.zip">ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/word/LNCS-Office2007.zip</A>).

The guidelines for paper formatting provided at the conference web site must
be strictly used for all submitted papers. The submission format is the same
as the camera-ready format. Please check and carefully follow the
instructions and templates provided.

Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific
contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is
applicable.

Papers that are out of the conference scope or contain any form of
plagiarism will be rejected without reviews.

Remarks about the on-line submission procedure:

1. A &quot;double-blind&quot; paper evaluation method will be used. To facilitate
that, the authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper,
WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors. This means that is necessary to
remove the author&#8217;s personal details, the acknowledgements section and any
reference that may disclose the authors identity 2. Papers in ODF, PDF, DOC,
DOCX or RTF format are accepted 3. The web submission procedure
automatically sends an acknowledgement, by e-mail, to the contact author.



Paper submission types



Regular Paper Submission

A regular paper presents a work where the research is completed or almost
finished. It does not necessary means that the acceptance is as a full
paper. It may be accepted as a &quot;full paper&quot; (30 min. oral presentation), a
&quot;short paper&quot; (15 min. oral presentation) or a &quot;poster&quot;.

Position Paper Submission

A position paper presents an arguable opinion about an issue. The goal of a
position paper is to convince the audience that your opinion is valid and
worth listening to, without the need to present completed research work
and/or validated results. It is, nevertheless, important to support your
argument with evidence to ensure the validity of your claims. A position
paper may be a short report and discussion of ideas, facts, situations,
methods, procedures or results of scientific research (bibliographic,
experimental, theoretical, or other) focused on one of the conference topic
areas. The acceptance of a position paper is restricted to the categories of
&quot;short paper&quot; or &quot;poster&quot;, i.e. a position paper is not a candidate to
acceptance as &quot;full paper&quot;.



Camera-ready

After the reviewing process is completed, the contact author (the author who
submits the paper) of each paper will be notified of the result, by e-mail.
The authors are required to follow the reviews in order to improve their
paper before the camera-ready submission.



Publications

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under
an ISBN reference. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in
the Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series.
