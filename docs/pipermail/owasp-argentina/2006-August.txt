Subject: [Owasp-argentina] New OWASP Mailing Lists
Message-ID: <44DB4A37.8060603@owasp.org>

Attention OWASP Community,

OWASP is moving all of our mailing lists off of SourceForge and onto our
own infrastructure. We?re making this move to allow for better control
over the mail infrastructure and to address some service problems we?ve
been experiencing. Your account will be moved automatically, and you
don?t need to take any action. However, you may want to set your spam
filter to allow messages from the new lists. All OWASP email lists will
come from @lists.owasp.org. All OWASP lists can be found at
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo

Thank you for your continued support of OWASP.

--OWASP
