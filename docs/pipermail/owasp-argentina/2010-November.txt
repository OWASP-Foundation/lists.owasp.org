Subject: [Owasp-argentina] Default virtual host y nombres inexistentes
Message-ID: <890738.77496.qm@web113804.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hola tod en s:

Estoy desarrollando un script de nmap que sirve para probar virtual hosts contra un host determinado. La idea es que analizando las respuestas http poder determinar cuales estan hosteados aun si no estan registrados. Esto permite hallar entornos de desarrollo. Este tipo de exploración no es novedoso, metasploit tiene un módulo similar, según me enteré cuando ya lo habia hecho.

Si alguien lo quiere probar, que vea las referencias. Cualquier dificultad, me contacta. 



Mi pregunta es, qué políticas se están usando para una exploración de este tipo. Usar un default virtual host para dar 200 a los nombres inexistentes? Redirigir? No hacer nada?

Hello Argentina Chapter,

 

The OWASP Leader’s mailing list has produced the thread below and it was
thought it would be useful if you had knowledge of it.

 

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [Owasp-leaders] Question about owasp logos

 

I just took a look at this and at first sight they are doing a lot of things
right (remember that our objective is to have OWASP materials and brand as
widely used as possible)

 

#1) They are not calling it an 'OWASP Web Application Security' course
(which usually implies that it is an OWASP Activity)

#3) When OWASP in mentioned on the course description it says '...based on
OWASP.." (which again is the right way to place it)

#3) The branding is clearly not OWASP and it should be obvious to the
attendees that this is not an OWASP-run event.

 

Now, the problem with #3 (Branding of the course) is that they also use
OWASP Logo (and name) in the banner. This is a fuzzy area and as long as the
impression is not given that this is an OWASP-driven and organized event, we
should actually be encouraging this type of activity (instead of 'hitting
them hard'). 

 

The only two things I can think of to ask them is 

1) to use a logo that has the text 'based on' inside it (as in : "...based
on OWASP materials...") and to include a link to OWASP's website were we
make it very explicit that we/OWASP :

 - supports the use of OWASP materials by training companies 

 - but are DO NOT responsible for the course content or delivery

 - and DO NOT endorse or recommend it.

 

The question/issue that I think we should focus on is how to find a way to
link from OWASP's website to this course (so that it encourages more like
this). The http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Related_Commercial_Services
is still in early days, but that would be the place to do it.

 

Note that what we CAN'T put on OWASP's website is:

*	Marketing text provided by commercial companies about what they do
*	Directly link to external commercial services not organized by OWASP
*	Advertize commercial activities at OWASP's Chapter/Conferences
events or pages (unless managed and controlled by the Conference
Organization team or by the OWASP
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Related_Commercial_Services>  Related
Commercial Services project)

Note that the Chapter's Committee is currently inactive, so chapter leaders
please take a moment to look at your chapter and make sure that there is a
very big and explicit separation between OWASP Activities and the inevitable
commercial interests that exist in your chapter (for more details see the
OWASP Chapter <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Chapter_Handbook>
Handbook).

 

Recapping, we need to find more ways to encourage the use of OWASP
materials, and what is really needed are a number of 'use-case' in our WIKI
that help individuals/companies to understand the rules-of-the-game and the
best way to leverage the amazing materials that our leaders create.

Hi Leaders!

I have a question .. I just learned that a company is conducting a workshop
to explain the OWASP TOP10 and web application security, which will cost $
60 and is using the logos of "OWASP" on the flyers and website.
I'm sure this is not allowed by the license type OWASP trademark, but I want
to confirm it.

Here is the link of the flyer
