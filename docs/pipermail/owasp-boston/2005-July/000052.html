<PRE>Although we will be giving it a rest in August, we will be talking about
REST in July. Please feel free to forward this announcement.
 
Meeting time 6:30 pm
 
Wednesday's topic - 
 
Web Services are usually associated with the &quot;triumvirate&quot; of SOAP, WSDL,
and UDDI. However, over the past 18 months, REST Web Services have enjoyed
increasing popularity. Although the theory surrounding REST
(REpresentational State Transfer) is complex, the practice is simple: use
long-established Web technologies instead of SOAP. REST Web Services are
addressed using HTTP GETs and POSTs to send and receive plain-XML (as
opposed to SOAP) documents to URLs. The so-called &quot;mega Web Services&quot;
offered by Google, Amazon, and Yahoo! all feature REST interfaces which have
proven to be very popular amongst developers, especially when compared to
their SOAP-based equivalents. Clearly, REST Web Services have much in common
with Web applications, but there are also important differences (for
example, cookies have no place in the REST architecture). 

In this talk, we examine the security implications of REST. We ask a number
of questions:

- Can Web Application Security techniques adequately protect REST Web
Services? 

- Since REST Web Services cannot use WS-Security, does that mean they are
insecure?

- What security guidelines can you offer to developers who are using REST
Web Services?

- What do XML security vendors do to protect REST Web Services?

Speaker - 
Mark O'Neill is CTO at Vordel, a leading vendor of XML security products
since 1999
 
Freebies - 
All attendees will get free Web Services Security wallcharts

Pizza will be provided by Vordel.
 
Directions - 
Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,
Sixth Floor Waltham, MA.
