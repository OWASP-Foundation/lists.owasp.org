Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP mtg this Wed 10/7 in Waltham
Message-ID: <0D8299A04960AE4C8906052835761AF1039EEA46@STCEXCPMB02.corp.star>

We'll be meeting at Microsoft in Waltham as usual. See
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston for directions. 

 

Main Presentation - From Rivals to BFF: WAF & VA Unite

For years there was a debate in the Web application and data security
world about which approaches are best - black box, white box, SDLC, VA
services/software, Web Application Firewalls (WAF), etc. While it is
true that with a limited budget anything can become competitive - a new
copy machine versus a new coffee machine, the core value propositions of
WAF and VA are distinct and complementary. This presentation will
illustrate how integrating these solutions can enable more secure Web
application development and operations.

 

Speaker - Paul Schofield has over twelve  years of experience in
Information Security and Risk Management. He is currently a Senior
Security Engineer with Imperva.  Paul has broad business and technical
experience ranging from mergers and acquisitions to incident response
and investigations. He is a frequent public speaker, a member of several
professional organizations, and because of his diverse background he
brings insightful perspectives to security and risk management
discussions.

 

Paul is also a regular OWASP Boston attendee so he knows our non-product
orientation and he's pretty good at talking about what is happening in
the industry and why.

 

We'll have some networking and general tool discussion before the main
presentation.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] Interesting post - 13 Things a Web Application
	Attacker Won't Tell You
Message-ID: <9FF43BA408CE4042A41F3C33BFDFA45D0DEB0BA2@exchange-ca.us.imperva.com>

A very fun post came across my desk this morning:

From: http://denimgroup.posterous.com/13-things-a-web-application-attacker-wont-tel


13 Things a Web Application Attacker Won't Tell You

1.????Just because you moved something from being a GET parameter to a POST parameter so I couldn't see it in the URL bar doesn't mean
	 that I don't know it is there.? And it also doesn't mean I can't change it.? (Download?WebScarab?if you disagree)
2.????Just because you put something in a hidden FORM parameter doesn't mean I can't find it.? Or change it.? See #1.
3.????Ditto for cookies.? See #1.
4.????Validating things on the client side with JavaScript doesn't prevent me from submitting whatever the heck I want.
5.????I love it when you say "That would never happen in production."
6.????I really love it when you say "An attacker would never do that."
7.????I really hate strong server side input validation.
8.????That page with the detailed error message - my job would be way harder without it.
9.????Most of those "Guaranteed Secure!" banners you put on your site only serve to tell me you don't understand the first thing about security.
10.??That web application scanner you ran - it didn't find everything.? Not even close.
11.??That network scanner you ran - it didn't even?start?testing the security of your application.
12.??I understand AJAX (or fancy, new technology "XYZ") better than you do.
13.??The more clever you think you are - the better I feel.



Enjoy!

Hi Folks,

I just want to make clear that the email I sent earlier today about the
Fishnet ES3 event in October does not mean OWASP or me are endorsing or
recommending Fishnet or the event. I just wanted to let people know
about a local security event where you could decide for yourself if it
might be of interest, no support by OWASP was intended or implied. Sorry
for any confusion.

 

Jim
