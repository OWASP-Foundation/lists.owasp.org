2. Software Development 2005 - volunteers get free day at conference
If people want to go for free, there is a way: they are looking for
volunteers. Apparently they are short on volunteers, so pass the word
around.
There are many security talks on the program, but these 3 look particularly
good and are all on Thursday:
 
Exploiting Software: How to Break Code

exchange. Unfortunately, we  
  cannot accommodate half-day exchanges.

  Volunteer commitment

        volunteer commitment required.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - Oct. 5 Meeting - room change to EBC at end of hall
Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E602B32115@fraexmb5.staples.com>

ROOM CHANGE FOR THIS MEETING - we're in the EBC (Executive briefing center

*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. Oct. 5  
 
Topic: Identity Federation : Prospects and Challenges - 

Speaker: Prateek Mishra, Ph.D. - Director, Security Standards and Strategy,
Oracle Corp
Identity federation is a collection of technologies that reduces the number
of
passwords that users must posses and administrators must maintain. Instead
of maintaining one password per-site, identity federation allows users to
"re-use" their logins from one site to securely access applications at a
second site. 
This talk will provide an overview of this area. It will discuss standards
such as SAML, Liberty Alliance ID-FF and ID-WSF, WS-Federation and
Shibboleth. It will also survey the progress made in actual deployments in
this space, as well as some of the unresolved challenges.
 
 
Topic: Application Security Gateways
 
Speaker: Ryan Shorter - System Engineer - Netcontinuum
What's involved in stopping application level attacks such as cross site
scripting and sql injection by inspecting the TCP/IP packets as they head
toward your web applications?
 
 
Pizza will be provided by Netcontinuum
 
 
Location:
Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,
