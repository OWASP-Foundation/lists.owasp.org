Message-ID: <CAHpuCED6EyUUVPUibg_U6z70LjDxCxvG1h275tJbDRJQqBQE9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone, we have two great meetings coming up.

First, this month on Thursday, March 24th, we will have "Online Security
for Kids". This one will be a little different from our usual meetings.
First, it's for kids! So please bring your kids, we'll have pizza and
drinks available for all. The meeting will start a little earlier, at 6 pm,
and the presentation is targeted to be just 30 minutes. What makes it even
better is the presentation will be delivered by a 10 year old. So it's for
kids, by a kid!

On April 7th, we will have a return of a very special guest from last year.
Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin will come and talk to us about the
state of US Cybersecurity. Congressman Langevin is the co-chair of the
House Cybersecurity Caucus and the Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence, and is very focused on US cybersecurity issues. This meeting
will begin at our usual 6:30 pm start time.

Please RSVP at
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

We have openings for meeting topics from May forward, if there is something
you would like to present, or know someone who would.

Also some other exciting news, our host Swipely has changed their name to
Upserve. So meetings are still held at 10 Dorrance Street in Providence, at
Upserve's headquarters. Upserve generously supplies the pizza and drinks as
well as the meeting space.

Thank you and we will see you soon!

Hi everyone, just a final reminder about our OWASP Rhode Island meeting
this week, all details below. We did a test run of this week's talk to an
audience of 70 parents and kids. It was really well received. The "kid" is
looking forward to presenting for you all. Hope to see you there!

Message-ID: <CAHpuCEAxj4NSYxf4V-9==Z9pb70zp6XRoq237+EOfGb__x75dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

On April 7th, we will have a return of a very special guest from last year.
Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin will come and talk to us about the
state of US Cybersecurity. Congressman Langevin is the co-chair of the
House Cybersecurity Caucus and the Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence, and is very focused on US cybersecurity issues. This meeting
will begin at 6:30 pm

I know parking can be an issue downtown, especially now that the city has
extended the parking meters to 9 pm. A couple options are to keep circling
looking for a metered spot, there are parking garages in the area,
including down by the family court house. Another option some have
mentioned, if you don't mind a 10 minute walk is to park at the mall. It
will cost $2 when you leave, but it will be easy. There isn't much free
parking left downtown unfortunately.

On May 12, we will have Steve Carmody from Brown University coming to speak
on single-sign on mechanisms. He is the chair of the Shibboleth project and
has worked with SAML, OAuth, Federated Identity and other similar SSO
methods.

The meetings are at our host's offices, Upserve (formerly Swipely) 10
Dorrance St. Providence, 6:30 pm. Please RSVP at
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

Thank you and see you next week!

Patrick
