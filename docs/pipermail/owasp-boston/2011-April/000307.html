<PRE>Just a reminder - 

Presentations Topic - OWASP Exams Project 

Presenter - Ed Adams, CEO of Security Innovation 


Ed Adams will present on the new OWASP Exams Project and the work being
done by the OWASP Academies Working Group. This group has already
created a set of exam questions that can be used by universities and
industry alike to test knowledge in web application security. Ed will
walk through the questions and answers, and there'll be some giveaways
if you know the answer or even try. 

The project also has a set of rich technical content, which Ed will
review in detail with the group, including a new self-paced
computer-based training course on OWASP Top 10. Ed will also discuss and
demonstrate the new open source tool that was offered to the OWASP
Community as part of the Exams Project - TeamMentor OWASP Edition. 

There'll be lots of technical content as well as meta information on how
to use and find this new OWASP technical content, and we'll have a bit
of fun in the process. 

Speaker Bio Mr. Adams is the founder and business owner of the
Application Security Industry Consortium, Inc., an association of
industry technologists and leaders establishing and defining
cross-industry application security guidance and metrics. He is on the
board of the National Association of Information Security Groups
(NAISG). 

No stranger to the podium, Mr. Adams has presented to thousands at
numerous seminars, software industry conferences, and private companies.
He has contributed written and oral commentary for business and
technology media outlets such as New England Cable News, CSO Magazine,
SC Magazine, CIO Update, Investors Business Daily, Optimize and CFO
Magazine. Mr. Adams is in the process of writing a book titled
&quot;Information Security Management: Survival Guide&quot;, which will be
published by Wiley &amp; Sons and is due out in November 2009. He maintains
a blog with CSO Magazine, is a columnist for CIO Update and can be
followed on Twitter. 

Mr. Adams earned his MBA degree with honors from Boston College and has
B.A. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and English Literature from the
University of Massachusetts.
