Subject: [Owasp-boston] IEEE SecDev 2017 in Cambridge - early reg by Aug 18
Message-ID: <7ae70941239642eb84e6a2857bd61eb3@XCGVAG23.northgrum.com>

All-

The IEEE Secure Development (SecDev) Conference will be in Cambridge Sept 24-26. Conference agenda and tutorials are now posted.
https://secdev.ieee.org/2017/agenda/

Early registration deadline is 18 August.

SecDev is distinguished by its focus on how to "build security in" (and not simply to discover the absence of security). Its goal is to encourage and disseminate ideas for secure system development among both academia and industry. Developers have valuable experiences and ideas that can inform academic research, and researchers have concepts, studies, and even code and tools that could benefit developers.

I attended last year, and enjoyed the conference and tutorials. And it's great to have a local security con.
Feel free to email me if you have any questions about it.
