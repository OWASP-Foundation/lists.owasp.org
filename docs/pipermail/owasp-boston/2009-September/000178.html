Bob's Great Adventure: Attacking &amp; Defending Web Applications

 

Summary: This presentation will look at some common, and many newer,
techniques for web application recon and attacks.  Wrapped in a story
about Bob's quest for world domination, we'll look at some of the more
interesting web application attack methods in practice and how to defend
yourself against them.
