<PRE>Letting you know about the next OWASP Rhode Island chapter meeting. But
wait, didn't we just have one like, last week? Yes we did, but here's two
weeks notice about the next one. I'll remind you again a couple days
before. But if you want to come to this one, please RSVP back to me, so to
get you past the security desk quickly.

Here's the info:

May 7, 6:30 pm
XSSValidator

Description: xssValidator is a tool developed to automate the testing and
validation of Cross-Site Scripting (xss) vulnerabilities within web
applications. This tool leverages Burp Suite Pro's extension API as well as
PhantomJS, a headless, scriptable web browser.

Speaker: John Poulin is an application security consultant for nVisium who
specializes in web application security. He worked previously as a web
developer and software engineer that focused on building multi-tier web
applications. When he's not hacking on web apps, John spends his time
building tools to help him hack on web apps! You can find him on twitter:
@forced_request

Food and beverages will be provided by our host and sponsor, Swipely!

Location: 10 Dorrance Street, 9th floor.

This meeting will be virtual as John is not local. We will be back to an
in-person meeting in June with our next presenter, Ben Jackson talking
about his web honeypot findings.

Want to present for us in July? Let me know!

Thank you and thank you to Swipely, our generous sponsor with their meeting
space and the food and drink they provide.

See you on the 7th!

Patrick
