I think we can all get this certification at tonight's meeting - 
Jeremiah is very well known and respected in application security and
has presented to our group twice - he also promoted an equally
worthwhile and effortless web site security certification EXACTLY 1 year
ago.

All,

This is an April fools joke!

Jeremiah is a notorious prankster. See last years April 1st joke regarding  
scanless PCI compliance.

Now we will never be certified ASSes. Oh well!

Joe
