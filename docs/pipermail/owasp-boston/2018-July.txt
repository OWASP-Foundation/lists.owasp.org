Subject: [Owasp-boston] Call for Sponsors, Speakers,
	and Workshop Leaders for BASC 2018
Message-ID: <CA+XD4xY0pweKnrNJqO34wjZkG6hbfb9j2w42Npz69Rm-S2BM9Q@mail.gmail.com>

BASC 2018 will be held on Saturday, October 27, from 8:30 am-6:30 pm at the
Microsoft Technology Center, 5 Wayside Road, Burlington, MA 01803. We are
actively looking for Sponsors, Speakers, and Workshop Leaders.  Please see
the following page for the latest information about the conference:



https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2018_BASC_Homepage


The benefits of sponsorship are outlined in the sponsorship kit, which is
available from that page. The assignment of speaker and workshop leader
slots is unrelated to sponsorship.  The deadline to submit speaking and
workshop proposals is September 28.  For information about submitting
proposals, please see this page:




https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BASC_2018_Call_For_Papers


The OWASP BASC (Boston Application Security Conference) is an annual free,
one-day, informal conference, aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge
of application security in the greater Boston area. While many of the
presentations will cover state-of-the-art application security concepts,
the BASC is intended to appeal to a wide range of attendees. Application
security professionals, professional software developers, software quality
engineers, computer science students, and security software vendors will
come to the BASC to learn, interact and hopefully enjoy themselves at the
same time. We encourage local students, security professionals and
academics to present papers as a way to gain exposure and experience in
presenting at security conferences.
