<PRE>Mark,

 

Please don't use OWASP lists for this type of announcement.  There is a job
board available at OWASP that you can use for this type of thing, but the
mailing lists are to remain entirely non-commercial.  Thanks,

 

--Jeff

Subject: [Owasp-washington] Pegasystems seeking Product Security Lead
Developer - potential for telecommuting

 

Folks,

   Pegasystems, the industry leading Business Process Management software
vendor, is seeking to hire someone into a unique role exclusively focused on
application security architecture. Ideally, we would like this person to
work at our Cambridge, MA headquarters, but we are willing to have someone
unable to relocate to Boston to work remotely anywhere in the US.

   This will be a highly visible position in which you will design and
develop  (no white board warriors who think coding is beneath  them) the
security architecture inside our flagship product, an application platform
that is still generating multi-million dollar deals within industries that
are coping with historic financial losses. The ROI on our product is that
strong, and it may make us one of the safest software companies at which to
work given this climate. 

   Our customers, which include some of the world's largest firms, use Pega
Rules Process Commander to design and deploy BPM applications that automate
their standard business processes through the deployment of a rules-driven
web application. Your goal would be to make sure the platform addresses the
many vulnerabilities to application security - cross-browser scripting, SQL
Injection, session hijacking, etc. There is less emphasis on authentication
and authorization, although those to facets have their place. 

   Here is the complete job description, and sorry but we are not able to
use agencies:

   We started a business unit focused entirely on BPM 6 years ago and ran it
as a stand-alone business, branching out from our original product that
handled payment exception handling. The BPM unit struggled to make $2M that
year, but it was clear we could have a much wider impact. As we shaped our
technology, the entire company focus shifted to BPM and rapidly became the
industry leader. Our revenue target for 2012 is $1 Billion. 

      PRPC has taken us from new entrant in an emerging field to the
industry leader redefining how the world's largest firms run their
enterprises. These articles will give you a better understanding of how we
are perceived in the market place:
