<PRE>Next Meeting - Thursday June 19, 2008 .   Microsoft offices, usual room
- MPR C

Jeremiah Grossman (founder of WhiteHat Security) will present in person
on web application vulnerabilities. More detailed description soon.
Jeremiah is a great presenter and has lots of real world experience and
stories. 

 

Jeremiah is in town that day and wanted to present so I moved the
meeting date to take advantage of his offer.
