<PRE>Whitehat Security told me they screwed up Jeremiah's calendar and that
he will be in Boston on June 26, so that's the new meeting date. I'll
send out another notice when we get the specific topic and description
but Jeremiah is always interesting and entertaining. We'll still meet at
the usual Microsoft location, different room - MPR A.  For directions
and more info go to
