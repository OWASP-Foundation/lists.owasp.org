&gt;<i> Hi everybody,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry we've been quiet for a couple months but we've been busy lining up
</I>&gt;<i> some great talks for the next few months. We have three currently scheduled
</I>&gt;<i> that I think you will get excited about:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feb 25, How to Talk Security in the Boardroom
</I>&gt;<i> Mar 24, Online Security for Kids by a Kid
</I>&gt;<i> Apr 7, State of US Cybersecurity with Congressman Jim Langevin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All meetings will be held at Swipely, 10 Dorrance St, Providence. Thank
</I>&gt;<i> you Swipely!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you can see we have a great lineup coming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, this month, we have John Strand from Black Hill Information
</I>&gt;<i> Security to tell us how to talk to your management about security. When
</I>&gt;<i> talking with colleagues, we usually have an understanding of what's
</I>&gt;<i> important and why and may not need to explain it as much. But when talking
</I>&gt;<i> to C-level management, it might require a different tack, a different way
</I>&gt;<i> of explaining things. John will tell us ways that he accomplishes this.
</I>&gt;<i> John is located in South Dakota, so this presentation will be live
</I>&gt;<i> streamed. Meeting will start at 6:30 pm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next, on March 24, we will start a half hour early, at 6 pm, because this
</I>&gt;<i> one is for the kids! Please bring your kids to this meeting as we will talk
</I>&gt;<i> about how to best protect kids online, things to think about and good
</I>&gt;<i> online behavior for kids. Even better, the presentation will be by a kid,
</I>&gt;<i> 10 year old McKenna. It should be a fun session with great information, and
</I>&gt;<i> will start at 6, so we don't keep the kids out too late on a school night.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, on April 7, we will have US Congressman Jim Langevin back to talk
</I>&gt;<i> to us again about the state of US cybersecurity. He will tell us what
</I>&gt;<i> Congress is doing, what bills are being discussed, what he's working on
</I>&gt;<i> with regard to computer and network security, as well as take questions
</I>&gt;<i> from the audience. We had a similar meeting with the Congressman last year
</I>&gt;<i> and it went extremely well. This meeting will start at 6:30 pm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All meetings, including the one with Congressman Langevin will be held at
</I>&gt;<i> Swipely's headquarters, 10 Dorrance Street in Providence. Swipely also
</I>&gt;<i> generously provides pizza and refreshments at each session for us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's what we have for now, with even more coming as the spring
</I>&gt;<i> approaches. Please RSVP either by responding to this email or at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/">http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you and see you on February 25th!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Patrick Laverty
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP RI Chapter Leader
