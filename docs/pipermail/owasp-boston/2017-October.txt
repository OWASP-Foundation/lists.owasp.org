OWASP BASC 2017 will be held on Saturday, October 14, from 8:30 am-6:30 pm
at the Microsoft Technology Center, 5 Wayside Road, Burlington, MA 01803.


Registration for BASC 2017 is open, as is registration for the BASC
workshops.  If you register for a workshop, please also be sure to register
for the BASC 2017 conference itself so that we will have an accurate meal
count.


https://www.eventbrite.com/o/owasp-boston-591242931


Note that while the workshop tickets are free, these tickets are limited.
We ask that you only take a workshop ticket if you plan to attend.  If your
plans change, please cancel your ticket to free the space up for others.
Do not sign up for more than one session of the same workshop, or for
workshops whose times overlap.   If you do, we reserve the right to cancel
one or more of those tickets.


The OWASP BASC is a free, one-day, informal conference, aimed at increasing
awareness and knowledge of application security in the greater Boston area.
While many of the presentations will cover state-of-the-art application
security concepts, the BASC is intended to appeal to a wide range of
attendees. Application security professionals, professional software
developers, software quality engineers, computer science students, and
security software vendors will come to the BASC to learn, interact and
hopefully enjoy themselves at the same time. We encourage local students,
security professionals and academics to present papers as a way to gain
exposure and experience in presenting at security conferences.

welcome to share with their colleagues.

They can use the URL and token key below to register:URL:

our learning approach.

Anyone who registers will have access to the platform until the 15th of
November. Steve said to "consider it his National Cyber Security gift to
the Chapter :). "

Best,
Mike
