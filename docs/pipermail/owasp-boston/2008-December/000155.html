<PRE>Just a reminder about tomorrow's meeting. In case you don't go to the
RSA 2009 Security Conference, you can get some of the conference content
at our meeting; Brian will (probably) present a modified version of this
talk in the Application track of that conference.

 See you tomorrow.

 

Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,
Sixth Floor Waltham, MA

 

6:30 

Announcements, stories from the trenches

 

7:00 Main Presentation

 

Tamper-Proofing Web Applications

 

The majority of the data passed to a typical web application never
originates from the user.  Embedded inputs such hidden form fields,
selectable form elements, cookies, and URL parameters all originate
within the application yet these values are often vulnerable to
tampering and manipulation attacks. In theory web application firewalls
can easily prevent these attacks, but in reality they rarely do. 

 

This presentation will discuss how HTTP response analysis can be used by
web application firewalls to provide instant real-time protection
against tampering and manipulation attacks.  

 

Freely available software that can be used to implement this defense
technique will be demonstrated and compared with other common web
application firewall technologies.

worked in the realm of information security for over 9 years, and has
deep experience identifying and exploiting software security flaws.
Brian is a frequent speaker at various security conferences and was a
contributing author for &quot;Network Security Tools&quot; (O'Reilly), where he

tools for web-based applications.

 

Directions - 

&gt;<i>From Rt. 128 North take exit 26 toward Waltham, East up the hill on Rt.
</I>20. From Rt 128 South take exit 26 but go around the rotary to get to 20
East to Waltham. Follow signs for Rt. 117 (left at the second light).
When you get to 117 turn left (West). You will cross back over Rt. 128.
Jones Rd. (look for the Waltham Weston Corporate Center sign) is the
second left, at a blinking yellow light, on Rt. 117 going west about 0.1
miles from Rt. 128 (I95). The office building is at the bottom of Jones
Rd. Best parking is to turn right just before the building and park in
the back. Knock on the door to get the security guard to open it. The
room is MPR C on the 6th floor.
