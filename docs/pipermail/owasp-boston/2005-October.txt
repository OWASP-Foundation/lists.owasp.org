*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. Nov. 2  
 
Speaker: Robert Hurlbut  - independent software architect/developer,
consultant, and owner of Hurlbut Consulting, Inc.
 
Topic: Threat Modeling for Web Applications
 
This is a topic I've been trying to get a speaker on since I started the
group. This topic is most useful in a live discussion, much more so than
technical information presentations, which you can get lots of info from by
just reading the slides or the paper. Threat modeling is something you do
with other people (much harder than working with computers), not just learn
about.
 
Also, bring business cards for Microsoft software giveaways.
 
Pizza will be provided by Fishnet Security
 
Location:
Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,

2. New England Information Security Group

Thursday, December 15, 6:30 PM    Microsoft Waltham offices
TOPICS:
  <http://www.neisg.org/images/BulletSmall.gif> "Information Security in the
Next Decade," presented by Dr. Tanya Zlateva of Boston University
 
  <http://www.neisg.org/images/BulletSmall.gif> "Securing the Desktop - A
New Battlefront in Enterprise Security," from  <http://www.bit9.com/> Bit9.
Securing the network has been a key component in enterprise security. But
now the battle is being fought at the endpoint, where new unknown software
arrives every day -- whether by malicious intent, click-throughs rife with
spyware, or end users unknowingly downloading unauthorized software. We will
discuss this new "threat zone" and ways to win on the new security
battlefront.
     <http://www.neisg.org/images/BulletSmall.gif> Learn the most accurate
and effective ways to defend against today's most prevalent threats.
     <http://www.neisg.org/images/BulletSmall.gif> Understand the new vision
for enterprise endpoint security.
     <http://www.neisg.org/images/BulletSmall.gif> Understand why the
endpoint could become the new point of failure for the enterprise - and what
can be done to prevent it.
