<PRE>Hi Folks,

New Year, new meeting place.  Akamai has graciously offered their
meeting rooms as a permanent meeting place for Boston OWASP.  The first
meeting this year will be on Tuesday Jan. 8, 6:30 pm, 

 

Topic Name: Third-Party Application Analysis: Best Practices and Lessons
Learned

 

Chad Holmes will present details of the work Veracode has been doing
with their 3rd Party program, discuss the technical and business
challenges that have arisen during that time and lead a discussion on
what team members can do to help drive adoption of security best
practices across their vendor community.

 

The flow of the presentation is designed to drive discussion within an
audience - both from a technical and business perspective with some
anecdotal stories. Chad wants this to be an interactive discussion so
he'll have questions and you should bring yours I've already sent him
some.  The order of the presentation is:

*         Adoption rates of externally developed software

*         The risk within those apps

*         Some deeper stats on what &quot;3rd party&quot; really means (total
outsourcing/total COTS produced/open source/imported libraries/etc)

*         Some raw data about our experiences (to show this is based on
a large sample size rather than &quot;Look how awesome Veracode is!&quot;)

*         Challenges that will be faced (business, intellectual
property, policy, analysis capabilities, etc)

*         Best Practices for high rates of adoption

*         Lessons Learned and Recommendations

 

Chad Holmes has over 10 years of software development and application
security experience. During his time at Veracode, Chad has lead the
redesign and execution of the third-party analysis process to allow for
a more streamlined approach while still addressing common ISV
intellectual property concerns. In addition to his third-party analysis
responsibilities, Chad's previous work as a Security Program Manager has
lead to the successful roll out and improvement of multiple corporate
application security groups.
