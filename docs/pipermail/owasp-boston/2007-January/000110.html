<PRE>*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. Jan 3, 2007  
 
ToolTalk - Jim Weiler.
I'll be showing the CookieDigger logon cookie analyser tool from Foundstone.
 
Speaker: Dave Low, Sr. Engineer, RSA Security division of EMC
Topic: Tips from the Trenches: working with cryptography and key management
in applications.
Dave Low, Sr. engineer from RSA will share his experiences working with
customers (who will remain nameless), talking about successes and not so
successes, good practices and not so good practices. This is not crypto 101
or 300 or an RSA product discussion; but practical advice and anecdotes.
While Dave obviously works for RSA, the customer problems, successes and
good practices are really product independent. Dave will briefly cover the
basics of whatever crypto technology is involved in each example so everyone
can understand the example. 
I'll also be prepared to talk about my experiences writing an enterprise
encryption standard and guidance 
document, retrofitting encryption to existing data and web applications,
encryption options available in various web application frameworks and other
enterprise web application data encryption topics.

I'll also have Microsoft software to give away.
 
 
Pizza will be provided by ????
