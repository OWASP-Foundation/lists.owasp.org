Just a reminder about tomorrow's meeting. In case you don't go to the
RSA 2009 Security Conference, you can get some of the conference content
at our meeting; Brian will (probably) present a modified version of this
talk in the Application track of that conference.

 See you tomorrow.

Tamper-Proofing Web Applications

 

The majority of the data passed to a typical web application never
originates from the user.  Embedded inputs such hidden form fields,
selectable form elements, cookies, and URL parameters all originate
within the application yet these values are often vulnerable to
tampering and manipulation attacks. In theory web application firewalls
can easily prevent these attacks, but in reality they rarely do. 

 

This presentation will discuss how HTTP response analysis can be used by
web application firewalls to provide instant real-time protection
against tampering and manipulation attacks.  

 

Freely available software that can be used to implement this defense
technique will be demonstrated and compared with other common web
application firewall technologies.
