<PRE>There will be 2 parts to the first presentation of the meeting, by Fortify -

Topic: Application Defense-Software That Fights Back!

In the last decade, the majority of security breaches occurred when networks
were broken into directly. Today, however, most security threats and
exploits derive from hackers maliciously manipulating software applications,
without ever breaching perimeter network defenses. The reality is that
software applications have changed little to address these new
software-based attack strategies. This presentation explores a new and rich
field: software application forensics and countermeasures. By using
real-world examples, this session will define and demonstrate technical
topics like attack surface, pattern recognition, tracers and method guards.
The audience will leave with an understanding of cutting-edge techniques for
strengthening software code and preparing for business discussions about
liability and post-intrusion investigation. This session will also
investigate common preventative and forensic tools such as intrusion
detection systems and application firewalls.

Topic: New Tools and Techniques to Help Discover Software Security Flaws 

A major contributing factor to information security problems we experience
exist because of software developed without security in mind. Whether it's
weak security requirements, design flaws, poor coding practices, or
oversights in software testing are leading to serious security problems with
the software our businesses rely on. Changing processes and how developers
work can be quite an undertaking; however, there are methods that anyone
involved in the software security process can use to see immediate security
improvements.
