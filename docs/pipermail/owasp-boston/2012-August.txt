Hello Jim: 

Been meaning to follow-up your email. 

I'd be interested in doing a 15-minute talk on the NSA Configuration Guidelines for baseline security: 
<http://www.nsa.gov/ia/mitigation_guidance/security_configuration_guides/operating_systems.shtml> 
We've found this to be very useful and vlear guidance -- and 15 minutes is about all it takes to talk about them.
