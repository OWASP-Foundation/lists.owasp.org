<PRE>The bad news is pneumonia has felled our Dec. speaker from CriticalSites,
and I was unable to get another 
speaker, so you'll have more time for shopping next Wed. CriticalSites is
very willing to speak and we'll 
have them in the future.
 
The good news is we have a speaker and topic for Jan. 4. Can't afford large
consulting fees to help with your 
crypto related problems or questions? This meeting could be the answer!
&quot;Tips from the Trenches: working with 
cryptography and key management in applications&quot;. Dave Low, Sr. engineer
from RSA will share his experiences 
working with customers (who will remain nameless), talking about successes
and not so successes, good 
practices and not so good practices. This is not crypto 101 or 300 or an RSA
product discussion; but practical advice and anecdotes. While Dave obviously
works for RSA, the customer problems, successes and good practices are
really product independent. Dave will briefly cover the basics of whatever
crypto technology is involved in each example so everyone can 
understand the example. 
I'll also be prepared to talk about my experiences writing an enterprise
encryption standard and guidance 
document, retrofitting encryption to existing data and web applications,
encryption options available in various web application frameworks and other
enterprise web application data encryption topics.
