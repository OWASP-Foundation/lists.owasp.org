Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP RI - Feb 18 - Digital Forensics
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEBTXWbWAyep-wApMRt3h3-WNtjqAcdVW=9TBCF69dphig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Our next OWASP Rhode Island meeting will be on Wednesday, February 18, 6:30
pm at 10 Dorrance Street, home of Swipely. Our meetings are always free and
open to everyone.

Our topic will be on Digital Forensics and our speaker will be Jacob
Fonseca. Prof. Fay-Wolfe will be unavailable so he generously found Jacob
to come and present for us. About Jacob:
Jacob Fonseca is a digital forensic investigator and security
researcher at the Digital Forensics and Cyber Security Center. He is
an experienced network administrator and is responsible for creating
and maintaining the DFCSC forensic lab and network systems. Mr.
Fonseca specializes in applied computer science for research and
education. He routinely works with state agencies toward improving the
security posture of critical infrastructure in Rhode Island. He earned
his Masters in Computer Science from the University of Rhode Island
and holds several certifications in the areas of investigation and
computer security.

As for upcoming meetings, on March 18, we will have Larry Cashdollar of
Akamai Techologies come and show how he finds Ruby gem vulnerabilities. On
April 15, we will have Stuart Gorton telling us about how to build a threat
intelligence program using OSINT. And finally, in May, it is looking like
we might have a new speaker to announce. I'm finalizing that now but I
think many will be excited to hear from this speaker as well. So many great
things happening.

Lastly, Security BSides in Boston is seeking speakers for their May 9
conference. If you're interested, you can find the information at
http://www.securitybsides.com/Boston

Please RSVP for next Wednesday's meeting at either our Meetup.com site (
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/)
or by replying to this email.

Thank you and see you on the 18th!

Message-ID: <CAKEaLKmCLVOYTAfcRpVAHfwqA0vzPvB9O8A4Xs=O_GXyZA4NLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,
We're trying to create a proposal to OWASP International for AppSec USA
2016 in Boston. An OWASP AppSec USA conference is designed, planned and put
on by the local chapter, and the local chapter decides on and does
everything - the desired venue; the number, themes and content of the
tracks; the number and duration of training classes; admission cost; the
additional tech activities; OWASP store; giveaways; fun events; marketing;
endorsements (AppSec Denver had a letter from the Governor); publicity etc.
AppSec brings in about half the annual OWASP revenue so it's very important
to OWASP.
This means we need a planning / operations committee comprised of people
who are able to commit increasing amounts of time as the date nears to
implement a 1000 to 1500 people technical conference. The committee needs
project managers, marketing, publicity, catering experts.
Unfortunately, while we have some pretty unique angles to offer with a
Boston conference (bio and health science security, other internet of
things and social media, foliage and duck boat tours)  the submission date
for AppSec USA 2016 proposals is Feb. 27. So if we have enough people
willing to take on this commitment by Wednesday we may put in a proposal.
Otherwise we won't put in a proposal for 2016 and we'll start the long game
for a 2017 proposal, and maybe you can help with a bigger BASC 2015.
Thanks, Jim
