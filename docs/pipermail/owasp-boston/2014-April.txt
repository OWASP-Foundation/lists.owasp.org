Hi all-

On Wednesday April 16 at 6:30 pm, we will have Mordecai Kraushar to talk
about the OWASP Broken Web Applications (BWA) Project. If you've ever
wanted to learn how to research web application security vulnerabilities
but don't know what site to practice on, then this talk is for you!

The presentation will include a demonstration of some of the realistic,
vulnerable web applications within the OWASP BWA project, including
applications written in PERL, PHP and Rails.

The presentation will demonstrate the many benefits of such vulnerable
applications
including:

? Testing web application scanners (people)
? Testing web application scanners (products)
? Testing source code analysis tools
? Examining code that allows the vulnerabilities
? Testing web application firewalls
? Reviewing evidence left by attacks

Mordecai Kraushar is Director of Audit for CipherTechs, a security solutions
company based in New York City. He leads an OWASP project called Vicnum,
(it is part of the OWASPBWA project)  which demonstrates vulnerabilities
such as cross-site scripting, SQL injections and session management issues
that are helpful to IT auditors developing  web security skills.  This
application has also been used in multiple 'capture the flag' challenges
including the Breaking Bad CTF at AppSecUSA in New York this past November.

The meeting will be held at Swipely (https://www.swipely.com), 10 Dorrance
St, 9th Floor at 6:30 pm. Please RSVP to patrick.laverty at owasp.org so the
lobby security guard will let you up quickly.

Lastly, May's meeting will be on May 7 and it will be about
xssValidator. xssValidator
is a tool developed to automate the testing and validation of Cross-Site
Scripting (xss) vulnerabilities within web applications.

Thanks all, hope to see you on the 16th!

Letting you know about the next OWASP Rhode Island chapter meeting. But
wait, didn't we just have one like, last week? Yes we did, but here's two
weeks notice about the next one. I'll remind you again a couple days
before. But if you want to come to this one, please RSVP back to me, so to
get you past the security desk quickly.

Here's the info:

May 7, 6:30 pm
XSSValidator

Description: xssValidator is a tool developed to automate the testing and
validation of Cross-Site Scripting (xss) vulnerabilities within web
applications. This tool leverages Burp Suite Pro's extension API as well as
PhantomJS, a headless, scriptable web browser.

Speaker: John Poulin is an application security consultant for nVisium who
specializes in web application security. He worked previously as a web
developer and software engineer that focused on building multi-tier web
applications. When he's not hacking on web apps, John spends his time
building tools to help him hack on web apps! You can find him on twitter:
@forced_request

Food and beverages will be provided by our host and sponsor, Swipely!

Location: 10 Dorrance Street, 9th floor.

This meeting will be virtual as John is not local. We will be back to an
in-person meeting in June with our next presenter, Ben Jackson talking
about his web honeypot findings.

Want to present for us in July? Let me know!

Thank you and thank you to Swipely, our generous sponsor with their meeting
space and the food and drink they provide.

See you on the 7th!

Patrick
