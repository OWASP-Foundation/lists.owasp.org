******************   Topic -    Tools of the Trade       *******************

Application Security has become the hot topic of choice in today's technical
information security landscape. Unfortunately there is little information
about what the elusive quality known as &quot;security&quot; in applications really
means; how to test for or evaluate this quality, and what tools can help
automate the testing process. Most of the information available is provided
by product or service vendors; most of the metrics available to support
their claims are dubious at best.
 
Enter the OWASP Taxonomy and Tools Project. Because there exists no clearly
defined taxonomy for the different methods of application security
testing/analysis, and no clear information on where tools of automation help
or what said tools actually do, OWASP (www.owasp.org) has started a project
to classify and categorize application security testing and tools. The
purpose of this project is to provide people with a free, objective, and
international resource for understanding what the different ways are to test
an application, and what tools purport to provide what automation benefits.
 
This presentation will provide a categorically different overview of what
application security is, introduce a taxonomy that discusses different ways
to evaluate the security quality of an application, and break down the tools
current available on the market; commercial, open-source, and freeware in
regards to where they fit in the testing taxonomy that will be introduced.
The attendee should walk away with a better understanding of the strengths
and weakness of various approaches to testing software, and a clearer
ability to peer through the vendor-biased claims made for the abilities (or
limitations) of automated testing tools.
