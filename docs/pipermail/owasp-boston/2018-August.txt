Subject: [Owasp-boston] BASC Presentations and Workshops needed!
Message-ID: <CANBiokSeFC5HORM9Wfm834firzXxsWQeS3sTu98DcYivo3YQVw@mail.gmail.com>

Boston area folks, OWASP Boston needs more submissions/speakers for our
Conference!  Don't be shy, please apply!

https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/118363/basc-cfp-boston-application-security-conference-october-27-2018

The BASC will be a free, one day, informal conference, aimed at increasing
awareness and knowledge of application security in the greater Boston area.
While many of the presentations will cover state-of-the-art application
security concepts, the BASC is intended to appeal to a wide-array of
attendees. Application security professionals, professional software
developers, software quality engineers, computer science students, and
security software vendors should be able to come to the BASC, learn, and
hopefully enjoy themselves at the same time.

BASC will take place 8:30am to 6:30pm on Saturday, October 27th at 5
Wayside Road Burlington, MA
