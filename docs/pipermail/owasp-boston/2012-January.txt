A Decade of Software Security: From the Bug Parade to the BSIMM

 

Only ten years ago, the idea of building security in was brand new. Back
then, if system architects and developers thought about security at all,
they usually concentrated on the liberal application of magic crypto
fairy dust. We have come a long way since then. Perhaps no segment of
the security industry has evolved more in the last decade than the
discipline of software security. Several things happened in the early
part of the decade that set in motion a major shift in the way people
build software: the release of my book Building Secure Software, the
publication of Bill Gates's Trustworthy Computing memo, the publication
of Lipner and Howard's Writing Secure Code, and a wave of high-profile
attacks such as Code Red and Nimda that forced Microsoft, and ultimately
other large software companies, to get religion about software security.
Now, ten years later, Microsoft has made great strides in software
security and building security in---and they're publishing their ideas
in the form of the SDL. Right about in the middle of the last ten years
(five years in) we all collectively realized that the way to approach
software security was to integrate security practices that I term the
"Touchpoints" into the software development lifecycle. Now, at the end
of a decade of great progress in software security, we have a way of
measuring software security initiatives called the BSIMM
<http://bsimm.com <http://bsimm.com/> >. BSIMM is helping transform the
field from an art into a measurable science. This talk provides an
entertaining review of the software security journey from its "bug of
the day" beginnings to the multi-million dollar software security
initiatives of today.
