   We will have two presentations at this meeting:
   - People Centric Security (PCS) is a new security model, presented as
      part of Gartner's Maverick Research 2 year ago. PCS is well suited for
      Cloud Business/Consumer services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive,
      etc. PCS enables users to have what they desire, and provides enterprises
      what they require for data governance and compliance. Nick
