</I>&gt;<i> This three-day course is designed to improve a person&#8217;s skills with
</I>&gt;<i> manually testing web applications and monitoring the resulting logs. This
</I>&gt;<i> course is focused on providing both testing and detection skills for
</I>&gt;<i> attendees. The training is structured as a hands-on proficiency course,
</I>&gt;<i> such that IT professionals of all skill levels should benefit. The course
</I>&gt;<i> leverages the Samurai WTF environment as a test lab, and primarily focuses
</I>&gt;<i> on the skillful use of interception proxies (Burp or ZAP) to efficiently
</I>&gt;<i> perform tests. It also helps build detection and monitoring techniques to
</I>&gt;<i> discover attacks against your web applications and infrastructure. The
</I>&gt;<i> course culminates with a live-fire capture the flag that focuses on both
</I>&gt;<i> testing the target application as well as reviewing real-world application
</I>&gt;<i> logs for attacks.

</I>&gt;<i> web concepts, including: IP Addresses, Sockets and Ports, HTTP, HTML and
</I>&gt;<i> Javascript. We strongly recommend you have ready access to Administrator
</I>&gt;<i> rights if needed so you can change settings/disable firewall, tone down
</I>&gt;<i> Antivirus etc. if needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NOTE: Lunch is not provided nor included. There is a cafeteria on site
</I>&gt;<i> with some menu options available for purchase. Light breakfast (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> bagels, fruit and coffee each morning) is generously being provided by Dun
