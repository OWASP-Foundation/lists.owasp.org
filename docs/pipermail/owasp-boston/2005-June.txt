Giving SOAP a REST - a look at the intersection of Web Application Security
and Web Services Security
 
Mark O'Neill is CTO at Vordel, a leading vendor of XML security products
since 1999. 

Web Services are usually associated with the "triumvirate" of SOAP, WSDL,
and UDDI. However, over the past 18 months, REST Web Services have enjoyed
increasing popularity. Although the theory surrounding REST
(REpresentational State Transfer) is complex, the practice is simple: use
long-established Web technologies instead of SOAP. REST Web Services are
addressed using HTTP GETs and POSTs to send and receive plain-XML (as
opposed to SOAP) documents to URLs. The so-called "mega Web Services"
offered by Google, Amazon, and Yahoo! all feature REST interfaces which have
proven to be very popular amongst developers, especially when compared to
their SOAP-based equivalents. Clearly, REST Web Services have much in common
with Web applications, but there are also important differences (for
example, cookies have no place in the REST architecture). 

In this talk, we examine the security implications of REST. We ask a number
of questions:

- Can Web Application Security techniques adequately protect REST Web
Services? 

- Since REST Web Services cannot use WS-Security, does that mean they are
insecure?

- What security guidelines can you offer to developers who are using REST
Web Services?

- What do XML security vendors do to protect REST Web Services?

All attendees will get free Web Services Security wallcharts

Pizza will be provided by Vordel.

Mark is the author of the book "Web Services Security" and a contributing
author to "Hardening Network Security", both published by
Osborne/McGraw-Hill. Mark has presented training courses on Web Services
security in California, Washington DC, and London. Mark has written on XML
and Web Services security in Web Services Journal, XML Journal, Java Pro,
Enterprise Architect, Infoconomy, and Technology for Finance. For the past
four years, Mark has been chosen as a speaker on the topic of XML security
at the RSA Conference. Originally from Ireland, Mark lives in Boston
