<PRE>Hi Anurag,

I know you might not get this before the meeting but if not, I'll ask at
the meeting -  

1.       Do scanners that use instrumented web browsers as their main
technology have fewer false positives or more accurate response behavior
compared to scanners that emulate browsers? 

2.       What are the algorithms used to determine that a SQL injection
vulnerability exists? Do any scanners provide confidence levels in their
findings?

3.       What features allow a scanner to be more easily used as a
penetration test tool, beside recording user actions for replay?

4.       With software threat modeling, do you start from the 'inside
out', i.e. where's the data to protect and how could the controls
closest to the data be compromised, or do you start 'outside in', with
the threat agent from the internet and follow how they could get into a
web app from the outside? Is this even a useful question?

 

See you tonight,

Jim
