Hi Folks,
If you would like to submit a proposal to do a presentation at OWASP BASC
2017, or know someone who you think might have some interesting stuff to
talk about, just go to or tell them about
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BASC_2017_Call_For_Papers. Whether you work
for Amazon or Google, or are doing application security work at a business,
you probably have experiences that would be interesting and useful to
others. We're a very friendly and informal conference so this is a great
chance to try doing a presentation.  See you Oct. 14.

Jim

Subject: [Owasp-boston] Free One Day Application Security Training Oct 9
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKkM2MbbmT6aQDeut5JB0eVoCCmkgZvVPHMadTty1gbuDQ@mail.gmail.com>

This year the strategic goal
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Strategic_Goals> of OWASP is to
raise awareness and spread application security knowledge world-wide by
hosting a training world tour
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_World_Tour>. The 2017 world tour
will have three, free mass application security training events. Each
one-day AppSectraining course will teach 500 developers, software testers
and entry level application security professionals core security topics.
Boston is the only North American location.

Our goal is that each training will combine general security principles
such as the principle of least privilege, using secure defaults, reducing
attack surface with APPSec specific topics such as parameterized queries to
prevent SQLi and input validation and encoding. We are also interested in
teaching how OWASP Projects can assist in developing secure software.

We especially want to encourage students to attend. If anyone wants to get
fliers about the event they can post at their work or school please go to
https://goo.gl/forms/pBSwlvacMm6RWQgr2

We will announce the trainer in a few weeks but you can sign up now at
