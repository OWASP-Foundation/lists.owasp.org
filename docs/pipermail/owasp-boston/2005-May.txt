Subject: [Owasp-boston] Boston OWASP June Meeting  -  Tools of the Trade
Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E61A8016@fraexmb5.Staples.com>

******************   Topic -    Tools of the Trade       *******************

Application Security has become the hot topic of choice in today's technical
information security landscape. Unfortunately there is little information
about what the elusive quality known as "security" in applications really
means; how to test for or evaluate this quality, and what tools can help
automate the testing process. Most of the information available is provided
by product or service vendors; most of the metrics available to support
their claims are dubious at best.
 
Enter the OWASP Taxonomy and Tools Project. Because there exists no clearly
defined taxonomy for the different methods of application security
testing/analysis, and no clear information on where tools of automation help
or what said tools actually do, OWASP (www.owasp.org) has started a project
to classify and categorize application security testing and tools. The
purpose of this project is to provide people with a free, objective, and
international resource for understanding what the different ways are to test
an application, and what tools purport to provide what automation benefits.
 
This presentation will provide a categorically different overview of what
application security is, introduce a taxonomy that discusses different ways
to evaluate the security quality of an application, and break down the tools
current available on the market; commercial, open-source, and freeware in
regards to where they fit in the testing taxonomy that will be introduced.
The attendee should walk away with a better understanding of the strengths
and weakness of various approaches to testing software, and a clearer
ability to peer through the vendor-biased claims made for the abilities (or
limitations) of automated testing tools.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] Wed. June 1 meeting - Just cut thru the FUD, bud
Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E602B31DF1@fraexmb5.Staples.com>

Few people know that in writing the song '50 ways to leave your lover', Paul
Simon actually started by writing a song called '50 ways to secure your web
app', which featured the line 'just cut thru the FUD, bud'. Paul gave up
that theme for the song after he realized there were no web apps yet but he
was still being inundated with vendor sales calls. Now, Arian Evans has
courageously (if atonally) taken up the same theme and will discuss (among
other things) the questions ' when will the tools be mature enough that I
just hit scan and get a report?', 'how can I determine which application
security tools are right for me?, 'is Kansas City barbecue better than
Memphis barbecue'.  Arian started and runs the OWASP tools project to
classify and categorize application security testing and tools. The purpose
of this project is to provide people with a free, objective, and
international resource for understanding what the different ways are to test
an application, and what tools purport to provide what automation benefits.
After attending the meeting you should walk away with a better understanding
of the strengths and weakness of various approaches to testing software, and
a clearer ability to peer through the vendor-biased claims made for the
abilities (or limitations) of automated testing tools, as well as a stomach
full of free pizza.
 
Fishnet Security will provide pizza.
