Date - Dec 17

 

Time - 6:30 p.m.

 

Agenda:

6:30 - 6:50 - informal attendee networking on the 2 presentation topics.
We'll have 2 discussion groups in different parts of the room

 

6:50 - 7  - what's happening in OWASP and how it might be useful to you

 

Two presentations - 

First: Advanced Web Application Pen Testing techniques   7 - 8 pm

 

Description:  Application pen testing activities range from simply
typing symbols into any text field on any page you find, to multi form
navigation with specific data values entered into specific fields on
different pages, in order to get the application into a specific state.
This presentation will demonstrate some standard techniques used by
advanced pen testers to combine both automated and manual testing, using
Hailstorm, an automated web application security scanning tool.  Topics
include setting breakpoints and single stepping within an automated
application scan, modifying injection values on the fly, instant results
testing, adding manual test results for integrated reporting. 

 

Second - Organizational Challenges from implementing Web App Security
Processes   8 -9 pm

 

Description:  Collaboration between application development teams and IT
security teams is often an un-natural act in most organizations.  When
IT Security first starts scanning web applications and notifying
developers of security vulnerabilities/bugs that are found, a fairly
typical sequence of events occurs.  These events are driven by a
combination of emotions, business drivers, and impact to schedules and
result in creation / evolution of new collaborative workflows.  This
presentation will focus on the typical stages organizations go through
as they ramp up effective web app security practices.
