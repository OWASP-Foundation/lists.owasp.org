Advanced Web Application Pen Testing techniques 

Organizational Challenges from implementing Web App Security Processes 


Two presentations - First: Advanced Web Application Pen Testing
techniques 7 - 8 pm 

Description: Application pen testing activities range from simply typing
symbols into any text field on any page you find, to multi form
navigation with specific data values entered into specific fields on
different pages, in order to get the application into a specific state.
This presentation will demonstrate some standard techniques used by
advanced pen testers to combine both automated and manual testing, using
Hailstorm, an automated web application security scanning tool. Topics
include setting breakpoints and single stepping within an automated
application scan, modifying injection values on the fly, instant results
testing, adding manual test results for integrated reporting. 

Second - Organizational Challenges from implementing Web App Security
Processes 8 -9 pm 

Description: Collaboration between application development teams and IT
security teams is often an un-natural act in most organizations. When IT
Security first starts scanning web applications and notifying developers
of security vulnerabilities/bugs that are found, a fairly typical
sequence of events occurs. These events are driven by a combination of
emotions, business drivers, and impact to schedules and result in
creation / evolution of new collaborative workflows. This presentation
will focus on the typical stages organizations go through as they ramp
up effective web app security practices. 


Edward Bender has spent 20+ years in the technology industry focusing on
all aspects of applications including functionaliyt, performance,
reliability and security. Ed held roles including application
development and application-performance optimization at Convex Computer
Corporation, Hewlett Packard and Mercury Interactive. As Director of
Technical Services at Cenzic, Ed now leverages his knowledge to help
organizations integrate solutions and address technology challenges in
the rapidly evolving Application Security Lifecycle.
