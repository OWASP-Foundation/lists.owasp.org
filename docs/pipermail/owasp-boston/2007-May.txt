Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - June 6 Mtg
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4A751@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. June 6  
 
ToolTalk: Jim Weiler
WebGoat and Crosssite Request Forgeries
 
In keeping with our theme of 'experience, not just technology', Danny Allen
will be talking about exploits they've seen and software changes they've
seen that make a difference.
 
Main Speaker: 
Danny Allan; Director, Security Research, Watchfire

Topic: 
Exploitation of the OWASP Top 10: Attacks and Strategies
 
We often talk about the vulnerabilities that make up the OWASP Top 10, but
sometimes we lack the awareness of how the true exploitations actually take
place.  A vulnerability is a very different thing from an exploit.  This
presentation will demonstrate some of the more advanced exploitation
techniques we are seeing around the OWASP Top 10 and how the Web 2.0 world
has opened a world of opportunity.  We will also discuss some of the small
changes an organization can do to be more effective in securing online
software.  It's easy to talk about secure software, but it's often hard to
know where to start.  What are the simple steps we have witnessed that have
made the largest difference?"
 
Pizza will be provided by Watchfire

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - local security event
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4A769@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

Hi Folks,
I wanted to forward this invitation to an event run by the New England
chapter of NAISG. ---

Hello everyone,

We would like to invite you to a security meeting that will be of general
interest to anyone in the IT community, especially those in the metro Boston
area and more so for those that like free software, networking opportunities
and go-kart racing!

My group, the National Information Security Group (NAISG,
<http://www.naisg.org/> http://www.naisg.org) is combining the June meeting
of our New England chapter with our annual charity fundraiser for a totally
different kind of event.

	A> Presentation... Mike Rothman, the well-known author of The
Pragmatic CSO (http://www.pragmaticcso.com <http://www.pragmaticcso.com/> )
and The Daily Incite (http://securityincite.com <http://securityincite.com/>
), will present "An Evening with the Pragmatic CSO."  This will not be about
technology; it will be about being an effective security administrator,
manager or executive.   Regardless of whether you are a CSO or an
administrator, you need to communicate what you are going to do within the
context of your business and track your effectiveness. The methodology also
addresses getting budgetary approval, interfacing with auditors, and just
figuring out what it's going to take to be a premier security practitioner.
Mike will also be available to sign copies of the Pragmatic CSO after the
session.

	B> High-Velocity... Strap on your racing helmets and suit up.  We
will be hitting the track for some serious go-kart racing.

	C> Give-Aways... We have a number of fully-licensed (NFR) copies of
Windows Vista Ultimate and Office 2007 Professional to give away to
attendees.  Copies are limited and these will be provided on a first-paid,
first-served basis.  (A special thanks to Culminis and Microsoft for
donating these for this event.)

WHEN IS IT?

	The event will take place on Thursday night, June 21, at F1 Boston
in Braintree, MA starting at 6:45 PM.  This is our regular meeting night,
but at a very different location.

HOW DO I REGISTER OR FIND MORE INFORMATION?

	Check it out here:  <http://www.naisg.org/events>

HOW CAN I HELP TO SPONSOR THIS EVENT PLUS GET SOME PR FOR MYSELF?

	We are very glad you asked.  We do need sponsors for this event.
Remember that all net proceeds from the event will be donated directly to
charity (The Caitlin Raymond International Registry,  <http://www.crir.org/>
http://www.crir.org).  Please see
