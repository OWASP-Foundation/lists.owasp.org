Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston Dec. 17 meeting
Message-ID: <0D8299A04960AE4C8906052835761AF103CE73E8@STCEXCPMB02.corp.star>

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston

 

Date - Dec 17

 

Time - 6:30 p.m.

 

Agenda:

6:30 - 6:50 - informal attendee networking on the 2 presentation topics.
We'll have 2 discussion groups in different parts of the room

 

6:50 - 7  - what's happening in OWASP and how it might be useful to you

 

Two presentations - 

First: Advanced Web Application Pen Testing techniques   7 - 8 pm

 

Description:  Application pen testing activities range from simply
typing symbols into any text field on any page you find, to multi form
navigation with specific data values entered into specific fields on
different pages, in order to get the application into a specific state.
This presentation will demonstrate some standard techniques used by
advanced pen testers to combine both automated and manual testing, using
Hailstorm, an automated web application security scanning tool.  Topics
include setting breakpoints and single stepping within an automated
application scan, modifying injection values on the fly, instant results
testing, adding manual test results for integrated reporting. 

 

Second - Organizational Challenges from implementing Web App Security
Processes   8 -9 pm

 

Description:  Collaboration between application development teams and IT
security teams is often an un-natural act in most organizations.  When
IT Security first starts scanning web applications and notifying
developers of security vulnerabilities/bugs that are found, a fairly
typical sequence of events occurs.  These events are driven by a
combination of emotions, business drivers, and impact to schedules and
result in creation / evolution of new collaborative workflows.  This
presentation will focus on the typical stages organizations go through
as they ramp up effective web app security practices.

 

Location and Directions - 

 

Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,
Sixth Floor Waltham, MA

 

>From Rt. 128 North take exit 26 toward Waltham, East up the hill on Rt.
20. From Rt 128 South take exit 26 but go around the rotary to get to 20
East to Waltham. Follow signs for Rt. 117 (left at the second light).
When you get to 117 turn left (West). You will cross back over Rt. 128.
Jones Rd. (look for the Waltham Weston Corporate Center sign) is the
second left, at a blinking yellow light, on Rt. 117 going west about 0.1
miles from Rt. 128 (I95). The office building is at the bottom of Jones
Rd. Best parking is to turn right just before the building and park in
the back. Knock on the door to get the security guard to open it. The
room is MPR C.

 

Pizza will be provided by Cenzic

Subject: [Owasp-boston] app pen test effort estimation
Message-ID: <0D8299A04960AE4C8906052835761AF103CE77B8@STCEXCPMB02.corp.star>

Hi Folks,

Does anybody have any comments, experience, suggestions etc. for
estimating how long it takes to do a web app pen test, or how long you
have found it takes? I know it can vary widely depending on the quality
asked for or the fact that you may only be allowed a fixed number of
hours anyway, but I wanted to ask.  

 

At the OWASP conference in DC last month I asked premier pen tester
Kevin Johnson about that and he said if he didn't really know anything
about the app - 2 weeks.  Talking to other pen testers, they get an idea
from the number of parameters, dynamic pages and main execution paths;
and the time varies from a week to 3 weeks.

 

Thanks, Jim

Jim,

Couple things - there's a similar discussion here:
http://seclists.org/pen-test/2009/Mar/136

and Burp-Suite 1.3, soon to be released, has a feature that may interest
you: http://blog.portswigger.net/2009/11/v13p-target-analyser.html (Thanks
to jabra for pointing this out)

As with all of the scoping you're going to do, it's going to vary highly on
tester skill, toolset, and thoroughness as well. many times those factors
get left out of the discussion. That's not to say you shouldn't be able
produce a good estimate.

Scoping based on URLs is tricky, as the amount of functionality hidden behind a single URL varies significantly depending on the architecture of the application.  You also need to scope based on functionality, workflows, roles, backend complexity, etc.  That being said, I would agree that a range between one to three person weeks is typical.  Assuming an experienced pen tester, a webapp on the high end of that range would be a site like Amazon, eBay, etc. that has so many different user levels and use cases that must be considered.  Your average consumer retail or banking site is probably closer to the two week mark.

Above all, you have to remember that pen testing is a time boxing exercise.  Your goal is to reasonably estimate when you'll reach a point of diminishing returns, not how long you'd need to find "everything" (since that's impossible to know anyway).  Stated differently, if a 1.5 week pen test would find 90% of the vulnerabilities that a 3 week pen test would find, is it really worth twice the money?

Is there a good how-to for using WebScarab?  I'm a newbie with this
stuff and trying to learn by playing with it.  I bought a book that has
some references to WebScarab and some basic walkthroughs, but it points
at "WebScarab" but when I download it from
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project I only
end up with "WebScarab Lite" and looks different from what I see in my
book and is also different from the screenshots on the site.  In my
download, I don't see the Proxy or Spider tab.  Are those separate
plugins that I need to download and install?   If so, where do I get
those, as on the Download page, I only see:  "As a framework, WebScarab
is extensible. Each feature above is implemented as a plugin, and can be
removed or replaced. New features can be easily implemented as well. The
sky is the limit! If you have a great idea for a plugin, please let us
know about it on the list."    

 

So I don't have to reinvent the wheel, are these plugins available for
download somewhere?  I don't immediately see them on the owasp site.  

 

Thanks!

You could start with the quick-start guide:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebScarab_Getting_Started

Scripting documentation can be found here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Scripting_in_WebScarab

Also. Googling provides some decent tutorials here:
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=webscarab+tutorials

Not to take away from the excellent webscarab project, but the web hackers
handbook + burp suite is an excellent way to learn how to use an attack
proxy against an application. you may want to check it out in addition to
webscarab.

Curious if anyone can elaborate on good security scanning tools that can
handle and identify Adobe Flash\Flex application vulnerabilities.

So a lot of your typical weaknesses are going to apply - make sure not to
trust unsantized input.

SWFIntruder was released this year - you'll definitely want to check it out:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SWFIntruder

Also, if you're trying to reverse engineer SWF's, the following are
helpful:

Flare - actionscript decompiler - dumps all the script
Flasm - actionscript dissambler (and assembler) - dumps bytecode

Also make sure to check the crossdomain.xml -

Merry Christmas!

 Hi Everyone,

I am not sure if this is the most appropriate place to post app-security
questions, but here we go >

I am a security analyst who provides security advisory support to software
engineering teams at my company. I am not a programmer. I started my
security journey from the infrastructure side and have grown into a more
well rounded role.

When designing application architectures a common problem that I run into is
secure password management for scripts and jobs. Example: An automated job
or script needs to authenticate to a database. In this scenario my developer
might want to store the database password in a clear text configuration file
or hard code it into the script. I do not like this as a security guy, but I
do not know of as better solution.

At some point a password is needed for these jobs to execute. What should I
be advising my developers to do? Can a java key store be used? Should we be
hard coding an encrypted password string? Use a certificate?

I am really stuck on this topic and feel that there must be a standard
method to solve this problem.

I would love to hear your collective thoughts.

Regards,
L.B.

Well a starting point should be that whoever owns the system needs to
have control of all passwords associated with it. If you have a system
manager who is the only person who knows the password to the system,
you have a serious problem if they either fall under a bus or decide
to attempt extortion. Both happen.

Access rights for scripts have always been something of a problem.
They don't really fit in the standard paradigm for access control. My
preference would be to create a separate account for each script and
to give the account system privileges to allow access to every
resource it requires.

That approach does not really work well across machine boundaries
though. For that I would probably want to use kerberos combined with a
primary authentication mechanism that allows whatever credentials are
in use to be tied to a particular machine in such a way that they can
never be exported.

I once ran into the same dilemma. Depending on where you work and what
your organizations security sensitivity is, some or all of my
suggestions may not be secure enough. For my particular setting, I
find that these suggestions provide a reasonable level of assurance
the password won't fall into the wrong hands (ie, disgruntled system
admin or an intruder). Here are some options you can consider:

1) Create a long running system process (or daemon) that is
responsible for orchestrating/invoking these jobs. This system daemon
would be responsible for invoking the db-specific jobs with the
appropriate db credentials at runtime. The system daemon itself would
never store the password anywhere but instead would be one of the
pieces of information it would require to be manually specified at
startup. You will want to make sure that attackers can't spawn their
own jobs by ensuring that the job scheduling information is read
directly from the database (which would require the attacker to have
the db credentials to begin with if she wanted to add an 'echo
password' job to the scheduled job list). Or,
2) Have the program that requires the db credentials at startup read
the credentials from a configuration text file and replace the
plain-text configuration file's contents with the encrypted form (in
the event that the file contents are not already encrypted). The
program would have the encryption key obfuscated within the code. Last
time I checked, this was the approach BEA's WebLogic server used. Is
this still the case, anyone?

Each approach has its drawbacks. I feel the first option to be the
safest, but requires the most up-front work and a re-alignment of
administrative practices. The second approach is simpler but less
secure as it is possible an attacker could peer into the programs
contents and possibly determine the configuration file encryption key.

I'd be interested in seeing what other approaches other people suggest.

LB:
I call it the "Turtle All The Way" problem. No matter where you put it
(in a Java keystore, for example), you will still need a password either
hardcoded in your software, or left in the clear on disk.

Here are some solutions. See which fits your risk tolerance and budget.

First, commercial and expensive:
http://www.cyber-ark.com/identity-access-management-solutions/application-password-management.asp

This works well

There may be others, I am not familiar with any other product.

Hard-coding passwords is generally not a good idea. If you must use that
approach, set the filesystem permissions so that not everyone can read
the script containing the password. (for compiled programs, reading the
password is not trivial, but it makes changing the password very difficult)

NEVER (assuming this is some *nix) supply passwords to a script as a
command-line argument (then a ps -aef might show the password)

My preferred, cheap (read: free) approach is below. Note that this is
NOT cryptographically secure, and will give up the password to someone
who can follow the code (hence the file permission)

I know this isn't foolproof, but better than clear-text pw on disk.

1. Put the password in a file. Encrypt it (some strong cipher) with a
key. Do not store the key anywhere on that machine--remember it or write
it down and put it in a safe. Naturally, back up the password file as well.
(if you have more than one application or script, you can put each
password in the file)

2. Write another program. At each system boot, it will prompt the
sysadmin for the key, decrypt the password file, and store the passwords
in an obfuscated form in shared memory

3. Your scripts (that talk to the db) need to know how to de-obfuscate
the password, and where to look for it in shared memory.

Good: No password in clear-text--you pass the audit
Bad: If the system goes down, it will require human intervention (but
for only one key that will unlock all the passwords)
Bad: People reading the script will know where to look for the
obfuscated PW and how to make it readable.

Happy New Year!
