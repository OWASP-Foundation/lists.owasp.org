Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston meeting Wed July 6 -  6:30
Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E602B31EEF@fraexmb5.Staples.com>

Although we will be giving it a rest in August, we will be talking about
REST in July. Please feel free to forward this announcement.
 
Meeting time 6:30 pm
 
Wednesday's topic - 
 
Web Services are usually associated with the "triumvirate" of SOAP, WSDL,
and UDDI. However, over the past 18 months, REST Web Services have enjoyed
increasing popularity. Although the theory surrounding REST
(REpresentational State Transfer) is complex, the practice is simple: use
long-established Web technologies instead of SOAP. REST Web Services are
addressed using HTTP GETs and POSTs to send and receive plain-XML (as
opposed to SOAP) documents to URLs. The so-called "mega Web Services"
offered by Google, Amazon, and Yahoo! all feature REST interfaces which have
proven to be very popular amongst developers, especially when compared to
their SOAP-based equivalents. Clearly, REST Web Services have much in common
with Web applications, but there are also important differences (for
example, cookies have no place in the REST architecture). 

In this talk, we examine the security implications of REST. We ask a number
of questions:

- Can Web Application Security techniques adequately protect REST Web
Services? 

- Since REST Web Services cannot use WS-Security, does that mean they are
insecure?

- What security guidelines can you offer to developers who are using REST
Web Services?

- What do XML security vendors do to protect REST Web Services?

Speaker - 
Mark O'Neill is CTO at Vordel, a leading vendor of XML security products
since 1999
 
Freebies - 
All attendees will get free Web Services Security wallcharts

Pizza will be provided by Vordel.
 
Directions - 
Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,
Sixth Floor Waltham, MA.

Hi Folks,
I thought I'd try passing along invites to application security events I'm
aware of. These are basically email only invites to live local events, so
you can't easily or at all find them by searching the web. I'm only planning
on sending these once or twice a month. No membership required to attend,
you can opt out of any future emails from them.

WHO: Charlie Cano, Senior Security Engineer, f5 Networks

WHAT: The Growing Problems with Application Security

The Growing Problem:

The threat from malicious attacks by hackers is growing exponentially, and
the financial consequences from these activities, whether in effort to
prevent them or losses incurred because of them, are an unnecessary and
often unbearable burden on organizations today.

Current security solutions, however, fail to provide the comprehensive
protection needed - especially against application-level attacks: *Network
Firewalls claim to provide 'application security' because they are able to
inspect the payload of packets and broadly categorize the content. However,
network firewalls do not aggregate the packets into full requests to
determine if each request is valid in the context of a particular
application. A customer accessing her own account information looks just
like a customer accessing everyone else's account information. *Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS) let everything through and generate an alert when
they identify traffic suspected as malicious (based on attack signatures &
traffic characteristics). Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) go a step
further, letting everything through except what can be identified as
malicious traffic (based on attack signatures & traffic characteristics).
However, both these systems suffer from several problems. First, they
protect only against known attacks. Second, they require constant updating
of the attack signatures and are thus vulnerable to so-called "zero day"
attacks. *Access Control vendors often claim to provide 'application
security' because they exercise control over which applications and Web
pages users can access. Once users are granted access to an application,
however, these devices provide no safeguards over the actions of the users.
For instance, users can swap identities in the application or insert SQL
commands into form fields in order to gain access to restricted data.
Comprehensive protection for Web-based applications & services:F5 shuts
these windows of opportunity by providing comprehensive security solutions
for protecting Web servers and applications against layer 3 through 7, as
well as application layer attacks. F5's TrafficShield protects against a
broad spectrum of attacks ranging from exploitation of Web infrastructure
and Web application vulnerabilities to flooding and reconnaissance attempts.
Its innovative, multi-layer inspection mechanism enables it to detect and
block only requests that are part of the attack, while forwarding legitimate
user requests. TrafficShield ensures Web security and availability of
Web-based services and applications - even while those resources are being
attacked.
