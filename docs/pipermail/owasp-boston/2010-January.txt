Hi!

I want to recruit you to my lending team, OWASP, on Kiva, a non-profit website that allows you to lend as little as $25 to a specific low-income entrepreneur across the globe. You choose who to lend to - whether a baker in Afghanistan, a goat herder in Uganda, a farmer in Peru, a restaurateur in Cambodia, or a tailor in Iraq - and as they repay the loan, you get your money back.

If you join my lending team, we can work together to alleviate poverty. Once you're a part of the team, you can choose to have a future loan on Kiva "count" towards our team's impact. The loan is still yours, and repayments still come to you - but you can also choose to have the loan show up in our team's collective portfolio, so our team's overall impact will grow!

Message-ID: <09DED73804A95B42ACFEFF57AEA3B24E07566366@MAIL3.AD.Brown.Edu>

Ok, you guys were a great help last time with my "lite" problem.  So now
I'm trying to install and run on my Red Hat machine.  I downloaded the
same zip, unzipped it and run the startup command, the wasp artwork
comes up but then I get an error: 

"main(Framework.extractVersionFromManifest): PKG is null".  

 

So in doing a little search, I see the code where that comes from is
here:

 

    private void extractVersionFromManifest() {

        Package pkg = Package.getPackage("org.owasp.webscarab");

        if (pkg != null) _version = pkg.getImplementationVersion();

        else _logger.severe("PKG is null");

        if (_version == null) _version = "unknown (local build?)";

    }

 

All the files in the directory have 775 permission on them and I do have
the latest JRE running.

 

Works great on my XP machine, but get these errors on RH.  Any ideas?  I
apologize if this is really a "duh" thing.

 

Thanks.

 

Patrick

If it can't find the package, your classpath may be incomplete. One possibility: make sure you are using ':' on Linux (as opposed to ';' on Win32) as the separator character when defining the classpath in the startup script.

Topic - Synergy! A world where the tools communicate

 

Description - Most penetration testers use many separate tools to get
the job done. The problem is that many of the security tools available
today do not have formats can allow for the tools to easily communicate
directly. This makes automation very difficult. This speech will explain
some of ways to fix the problem. We will be releasing several modules
that allow for pentesters to integrate the data so that we can work
towards automating a large portion of the process so that the pentesters
can focus on the difficult aspects of the assessment that can not be
automated. All pentests need to focus on performing the tasks that no
automated solution can. This will be done integrating the existing tools
we will make a large step in that direction.

 

Speaker - Josh Abraham.

Mr. Abraham joined Rapid7 in 2006 as a Security Consultant. Josh has
extensive IT Security and Auditing experience and worked as an
enterprise risk assessment analyst for Hasbro Corporation. Josh
specializes in penetration testing, web application security
assessments, wireless security assessments, and custom code development.
In the past, he has spoken at BlackHat, DefCon, ShmooCon, Infosec World,
OWASP Boston, LinuxWorld, Comdex and BLUG. In his spare time, he
contributes code to open source security projects such as the BackTrack
LiveCD, BeEF, Nikto, Fierce, and PBNJ.

Yes, we are having our regular Feb. meeting, even tho it's just 6 days
after the Jan. meeting.

Date - Feb. 3

 

Time - 6:30 p.m.

 

Main Topic - New Technology, Same Old Vulnerabilities

Technology often creates new, exciting and more efficient ways of doing
business. The added efficiency and lower costs frequently drives a
strong desire to implement the latest and greatest technology.  The down
side is that we often jump into new technology without fully considering
the security implications, and inadvertently implement the same old
vulnerabilities time and again.

 

Web services are a great example of this.   Web services are a means of
adding a web-based programming interface to nearly any legacy enterprise
application, and they are being implemented across many industries at a
rapid pace. In many cases we have seen that the implementers are not
considering security at all, but merely functionality.  This leads to a
wealth of subtle security vulnerabilities.

 

In this talk, Rob Cheyne of Safelight Security Advisors will explore
some ways that we consistently add risk to our organizations, uncover
some ticking time bombs, and discuss some ways to improve the situation.
He will explore ways that we can better apply security in the
development lifecycle when implementing new technologies.  Along the
way, he will provide examples of classical vulnerabilities that show up
in new technologies.
