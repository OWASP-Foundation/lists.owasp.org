Hello Everybody,
We had our first meeting last Wed.; 6 people attended. The presentation will
up on the web site soon.
 
O'Reilly books has accepted my application as a technical user group so you
can get 20% discount on O'Reilly, No Starch, Paraglyph, Pragmatic Bookshelf,
SitePoint, and Syngress books and O'Reilly conferences using their web site.
Just use code DSUG. O'Reilly also make free copies of books available to
reviewers. If you would like to review a book, send me the title and ISBN
number and I'll get it for you. Check out the review guidlines and examples
on the O'Reilly site. You can tell us what you thought at a meeting and the
review can go on the O'Reilly site and our site. I'll be reviewing  'Secure
Coding: Principles and Practices' .
 
I got some feedback on topics you are interested in for future meetings, and
that was some topics that would useful to management, not just detailed
technical topics, so I'll work on getting some speakers along those lines.
 
For those of you that didn't make the meeting, if you have any suggestions
for topics or can give me any leads on speakers that would be great. I'll be
contacting those of you that have expressed an interest in speaking.

Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E61A7E34@fraexmb5.staples.com>

Joe Stagner, Microsoft Developer Community Champion, will be presenting on
'Secure Development Processes'. Joe has started a 'digital blackbelt' series
of webcasts on the MSDN website and the initial ones are about secure
development tools and processes.
Bio - 
Joe Stagner joined Microsoft in 2001 as a Technical Evangelist and is now a
Developer Community Champion with the Microsoft MSDN Team. Joe's technical
career began at age 14 with a part-time job as a robotics control programmer
and has visited virtually every genre of technical vocation from Device
Driver Developer to President and CEO of a publicly traded New York City
consulting firm. Joe's development experiences have allowed him to create
commercial software applications across a wide diversity of technical
platforms from Mainframes through UNIX and Linux, to Microsoft technologies
on the Intel and Mobile computing platforms. While Joe is generally
interested in all computing technology, in recent years he has been
particularly focused on Highly Performant Geoscalable Web application
architectures, multi-platform interoperability, and Writing Secure Code. 
 
Joe offered to supply pizza so please let me know if you plan to attend so
we can get an idea of how much pizza to order.
 
Also, please bring a business card so we can do a raffle of some Microsoft
consumer software.
 
Check the web site tomorrow for info on the April meeting topics - 2
speakers!
 
As always, please feel free to send me any comments, suggestions or
complaints about the group. I'd really like to get a corporate speaker from
the real business world, so if anybody wants to give me the contact info for
a customer or application security person at their company, that would be
great.
