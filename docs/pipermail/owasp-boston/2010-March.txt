 Hi Everyone,

I am interested in hiring a consultant to provide a 1-2 hour presentation on
secure web application coding to a group of software developers.

Does anyone have a contact in the Boston area or know of other resources
that may be helpful?

Thanks,

Pat

Hey Pat

 

In my opinion, the best guy right now is Professor Colin Jackson who works
for Carnegie Mellon, and he recently gave a guest lecture to us here. He was
in the team of developers for Google Chrome's security. Also, you can
contact Professor David Brumley who teaches Secure Software Systems at
Carnegie Mellon. But David's work is more inclined towards systems security.


 

Otherwise, you can talk to SANS institute people, I am sure they have got
some good people for that. 

 

Hope that helps,

We are meeting the second week of March to avoid the RSA conference -
lots of people are there.

 

Meeting start 6:30 pm

Main presentation - 7 pm

 

Speaker - Zack Lanier

(in addition to his Bio below, Zack has a blog at

Topic - Disclosure Samsara, or "the endless vulnerability disclosure
debate"_

 

Vulnerability disclosure has a purpose. It can help make software and
hardware vendors and service providers accountable for shortcomings in
their offerings; and detailed or full disclosure can give IT and
information security professionals the information they need to validate
the resilience and efficacy of their controls. Generally speaking, a
happy balance is achieved when vulnerabilities are disclosed in a
"responsible" manner. But what is "responsible"?

 

It's been nearly a decade since the introduction of RFPolicy, a document
often considered to be the basis for modern, responsible vulnerability
disclosure, yet there still remains a significant division between the
camps of "full disclosure", "partial disclosure", and "zero disclosure".

The "responsible disclosure" debate seems to be an endless cycle, coming
back fully reconstituted *just* when we think it's been run dry.

Lawsuits, gag orders, and boatloads of drama are some of the negative
things researchers have dealt with when disclosing a bug or flaw to a
vendor or service provider. This type of reaction can be very
discouraging for a security researcher, possibly resulting in them
eschewing communication with the vendor in favor of disclosing it
outright or even selling the details to the highest bidder.

 

With continued, accelerated awareness and discussion, the information
security community can work toward solidifying an approach to disclosure
that, amongst other things:

 

* facilitates interaction between the researcher and vendor or service
provider

* acknowledges the researcher's work

* provides adequate protection for the security researcher

* builds a reasonable timeline and plan for a solution to the bug or
flaw (and keeps parties from stalling)

* builds a reasonable timeline for public disclosure of the bug or flaw

I provide training in security, including code security and I am in
the Boston area.

But really would need more context. 1-2 hours is sufficient to teach
people about the need for secure coding, but really not sufficient for
a comprehensive course.

This week almost everyone will be out at RSA though.

Hi Pat,

My company, Safelight Security Advisors, does exactly the kind of training and presentations that you are looking for, covering all members of the development lifecycle.  

I'm out at the RSA conference this week, but would be happy to speak to you further about it next week.  As Philip mentioned, 1-2 hours isn't a lot of time, but I think we have exactly what you are looking for, as we have done many similar presentations for developers and technical IT staff.

If interested, please drop me a line off-list.

Thanks,
  --rob
