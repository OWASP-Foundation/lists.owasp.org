Building Secure Software from the Ground Up
Start with an effective applications security strategy-save time and money 
How secure are your applications? According to statistics, more than 90% of
your vulnerabilities lurk in your applications, not in your network. Don't
let a security breach cripple your business!
Foundstone invites you to attend our FREE 1/2-day seminar in your local
area, and learn to build an application security strategy that minimizes
your risk. 
If you're a security manager or executive, software development manager,
auditor, or system architect, you won't want to pass up this opportunity to
learn why secure software is such a vital aspect of your overall security
posture.
Some of the topics we'll address include:
*         Why is software security so important? 
*         Why fixing security flaws after the fact is not the optimal
approach 
*         How building security into your applications in the early stages
saves time and money 
*         Best practices for your software development life cycle 
*         Why educating your staff is one of the most powerful investments
you'll ever make 
*         The truth about automated tools 
Foundstone invites you attend our NO COST invitation-only executive
breakfast seminar. Learn from the experts about how to reduce the risk of
insecure software.  We will also be demonstrating our latest suite of
Foundstone Free Tools, which our consultants use on our engagements and
share with our clients. 
All attendees will receive a Foundstone Free Tools CD, a leather-bound
portfolio, and more great door prizes. At each road show, you'll also have
the opportunity to win an Xbox 360(r) the next-generation Microsoft(r)
digital entertainment console
