<PRE>Hi all,

On October 13 at 6:30 pm, we will have our next OWASP Rhode Island meeting.
We will have Upserve's Adam Codega talk about how he manages Apple devices
in the enterprise environment. This meeting will be held at 10 Dorrance St
in Providence. Meetings are open and free to everyone, but we do ask that
you RSVP here, to get your name on the list for the security guard at the
front desk.

<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/events/233536478/">http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/events/233536478/</A>

Description: An environment where outliers were allowed to use Macs at work
unsupported by IT has turned into an environment where employees from sales
people to executives are requesting Macs and iOS devices, and saving the
company money at the same time. But, how are you managing these devices?

Also, at the last meeting, we talked about reviving DC401, a local chapter
of DefCon. There was a local chapter in the past, but it appears they last
met in 2013. I have spoken with their last chapter leader, Dave Johnson and
he is very supportive of us bringing the group back. Our idea is to
possibly alternate months between a DC401 and an OWASP meeting. If you're
unfamiliar with what DC meetings are about, they're about anything with
regard to IT security! Building, breaking, researching, sharing. So if you
know someone who is into IT security but might not be so interested in web
app security, let them know that DC401 will be coming back!

If you have any other questions, thoughts or ideas, please let me know.

Thanks!

Patrick Laverty
