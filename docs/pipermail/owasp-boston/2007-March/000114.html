<PRE>Speaker - Jeremiah Grossman
Mr. Grossman founded WhiteHat Security in 2001. Prior to WhiteHat, Mr.
Grossman was an information security officer at Yahoo! responsible for
performing security reviews on the company's hundreds of web applications.
As one of the world's busiest web properties, with over 17,000 web servers
for customer access and 600 web applications, the highest level of security
was required. Mr. Grossman is a founder of the Web Application Security
Consortium (WASC) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
Jeremiah speaks at Blackhat, Defcon, and I saw his talk at RSA, which was
great. Jeremiah has a great depth of knowledge, experience and anecdotes,
and is a very friendly, interactive guy (I once spent 15 minutes on email
with him after a webcast asking questions and more questions). So bring your
questions and enjoy Jeremiah's discussion of the top 10 attacks of 2006 by
creativity and scope; what these attacks mean for website vulnerability
management in 2007 and strategies to protect your corporate websites.
