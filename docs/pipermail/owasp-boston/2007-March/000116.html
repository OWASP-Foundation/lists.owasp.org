<PRE>*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. April 4  
 
I'm trying to have the meetings provide more unique information than
technology presentations whose information is often available elsewhere.
I've been trying to get speakers that can tell about experiences they've
had, things that worked and didn't work, good if not best practices, for
real world situations.  Mark was an OWASP Boston presenter before, and his
talk at RSA pointed out some things I never heard of. He's had lots of
experience with web services security and we'll get the benefit of some of
that at the meeting. I think it's worth listening to anyone who describes
the security company they work for as &quot;a&quot; leading .....vendor, not &quot;the&quot;
leading ... vendor. After that you gotta believe everything else he says is
true. 
 
I'm still going to try to do a tool talk but I wanted to get this notice
out. 
 
Speaker: Mark O'Neill, Chief Technical Officer at Vordel 
Topic: Case Notes from a Vulnerability Assessment performed on a financial
services Web Services application  

This presentation describes a real-life vulnerability assessment that was
conducted on the Web Services applications of a financial services
corporation. The vulnerabilities which were discovered are explained, and
countermeasures are proposed. Testing strategies are described. The Vordel
SOAPbox tool was used as a launch-pad for the attacks used in this
vulnerability assessment. All customer information has been anonymized. 

Mark O'Neill is Chief Technical Officer at Vordel, a leading Web Services
Security vendor. Mark is the author of the book &quot;Web Services Security&quot;,
published by McGraw-Hill/Osborne Media. A frequent conference speaker on Web
Services Security, Mark also provides training on secure Web Services to
governments (including US Government agencies), insurance companies, and
telecoms companies worldwide.
