<PRE>I'm very excited to have Chris Eng at the March meeting. The topic is
very interesting but as you can see from Chris's bio, he has lots of
experience in web app sec, so bring any questions you have, big or
small, general or specific, industry or technology related and take
advantage of this opportunity to get Chris's perspective.

 

 

Chris Eng; Senior Director, Security Research, Veracode

 

Topic - Attacking crypto in web applications


Description - 
This presentation will discuss penetration testing techniques for
analyzing unknown data in web applications and demonstrate how encrypted
data can be compromised through pattern recognition and only a
high-level understanding of cryptography concepts.  Techniques will be
illustrated through a series of detailed, step-by-step case studies
drawn from the presenter's penetration testing experience.

 

This is not a talk on brute forcing encryption keys, nor is it a
discussion of weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms.  Rather, the case
studies will demonstrate how encryption mechanisms in web applications
were compromised without ever identifying the keys or even the
underlying ciphers.

 

Bio - 
Prior to joining Veracode, Mr. Eng was a Technical Manager for Symantec
security consulting. He delivered high-profile security assessments for
numerous Fortune 500 companies, focusing primarily on penetration
testing of critical web applications, commercial software, and networks.
He was a technical leader for Symantec's Attack and Penetration Center
of Excellence, designing a penetration testing infrastructure.

Chris was a Principal Consultant and then Technical Director of @stake,
Inc. In addition to consulting, he led the development of WebProxy, a
proprietary web application testing tool which became an @stake product
in 2002

 

 

Pizza will be supplied by Veracode
