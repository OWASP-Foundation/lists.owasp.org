Subject: [Owasp-boston] June 4 meeting - SQLi, OWASP ZAP
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKk9Yc2o8m=7kO440faLOU7rzVbzdPDSTih8_vT3CBG+yQ@mail.gmail.com>

Time - 6:30 pm
general networking, news discussion, announcements.

7:00 - main presentations

The June 4th meeting will be the second in our series of 2014 training
meetings. Rob Cheyne will continue explaining and exploring SQL Injection
by conducting an actual injection attack.

Rob is currently CEO of Big Brain Security. In addition to security
consulting for Fortune 500 customers, he was the author of LC4, a version
of the award-winning L0phtCrack password auditing tool, and he also worked
on the code scanning technology that was eventually spun off as Veracode.
Rob was at @stake from the very first customer all the way through to the
$50M acquisition by Symantec.

Jim Weiler will introduce the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). This is a very
powerful free OWASP intercepting proxy that lets you see, analyse, change,
replay etc. every browser request and response, analyse your session, scan
and attack web sites, save the results and run reports. We can't cover all
the functionality but we'll show some practical tips and techniques.

Location -
Akamai      8 Cambridge Center   Cambridge, MA 02142
The entrance is on Broadway, between Ames st. and Galileo Galilei Way, just
west (away from Boston) of the Residence Inn. The T stop is Kendall on the
red line.

Hey everyone, we have our June meeting coming up. It will be June 11 at
6:30 pm at Swipely, 10 Dorrance Street, 9th floor. Please RSVP to me to
expedite getting past the security desk. Also, we added yet another means
of communication. We're now on Meetup.com!
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

All OWASP meetings are free and open to anyone. Spread the word!

We also have a July meeting scheduled, which you can see below, but if you
want to present in August, we'd love to have you! So here are the details
for June!

June 11, 6:30 pm
Title: Running a non-attributable honeypot system via fly by night VPS
providers

Description: Ben "@innismir" Jackson will talk about cheap VPS providers
and how they make great homes for honeypots in which you can monitor the
ankle biters that poke at your network day in and day out.

Speaker Bio: Ben spends his time enjoying being a husband, dad, and messing
around with anything that has a button on it. He was the author for
"Asterisk Hacking" from Syngress, has spoken at various conferences, and
has appeared on various media outlets discussing security and privacy. Ben
strongly dislikes Thursdays and writing about himself in the third person.

So please RSVP to me and thank you to Swipely for hosting, as pizza and
drinks are provided!

On July 16, we'll have Milandon Foley talking about Point of Sale (POS)
breaches!

Thank you and see you on June 11th!
