<PRE>BSIMM - 

The purpose of the BSIMM is to quantify the activities carried out by
real software security initiatives. BSIMM is a study of the secure
development practices of over 50 organizations, analyzed along the
dimensions that were found in the data, not along preconceived ideas of
what secure development should be.  

BSIMM describes the work of 974 software security group members working
with a satellite of 2039 people to secure the software developed by
218,286 developers.  

The BSIMM describes 111 activities that any organization can put into
practice. The activities are described in twelve practices grouped into
four domains. Associated with each activity is an objective.

Presentation - 

What is BSIMM?

BSIMM (pronounced &quot;bee simm&quot;) is short for Building Security In Maturity
Model. The BSIMM is a study of real-world software security initiatives
organized so that you can determine where you stand with your software
security initiative and how to evolve your efforts over time.

 

Why software security?

Software security is about building software to be secure even when it
is under attack. As we have learned from years network security drama,
protecting software is much easier if the software is built with
security in mind. Furthermore, security is a property and not a thing,
so software security involves much more than simply adding security
features like SSL or passwords to software.

 

Who needs this stuff?

Organizations that depend on software to work (and that's pretty much
everybody these days) need software that doesn't leak millions of
identity records, call election results into question, gin up huge legal
liabilities, or allow secrets to fall into the wrong hands. The only way
to make software trustworthy is to build security in. In short, everyone
who relies on software needs the BSIMM.
