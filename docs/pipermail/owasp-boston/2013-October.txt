I just wanted to make sure everyone knew that there is *no* OWASP Boston
Application Security Conference this year.  The only date we could get was
Dec. 14 and we decided that was not a good option. We'll apply earlier in
2014 for an MS NERD date and let you know as soon as we get a 2014 date.

6:30 - news, announcements

6:45 SQL Injection detection by Database error monitoring - Jim Weiler will
give a short presentation / discussion on database errors that happen
during blind SQL injection

7:10  Main Presentation - NetSPI -  Attacking iOS Mobile Applications and
Backends
*This presentation will cover the basics of attacking iOS applications (and
their back ends) using a web proxy to intercept, modify, and repeat
HTTP/HTTPS requests. (The proxy used during research was Bur; however, any
HTTP intercepting proxy such as OWASP ZAP could be used) From setting up
the proxy to pulling data from the backend systems, this talk will be a
great primer for anyone interested in testing iOS applications at the HTTP
protocol level. There will be a short (2 minute) primer on setting up the
intercepting proxy, followed by three practical examples showing how to
intercept data headed to the phone, how to modify data heading to the
application server, and how to pull extra data from application servers to
further an attack. All of these examples will focus on native iOS apps
(Game Center and Passbook) and/or functionality (Passbook Passes).*
