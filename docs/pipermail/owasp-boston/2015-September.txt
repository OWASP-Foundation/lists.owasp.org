Hi Folks,
BASC 2015 is Saturday Oct. 3. Our call for papers is open. If you or
someone you know (a coworker, teacher, friend) would like to do a
presentation at BASC, please submit your idea at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BASC_2015_Call_For_Papers

Form -
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YW8AcSWR1vUx2vdFufpBl0f8_8SsQdTX5Ts7va4_YcA/viewform

We encourage first time presenters; this is a great way to get noticed,
practice speaking and presentation skills.  We encourage students and
faculty and application security professionals as presenters. New research,
current practices, things that have worked and not worked are all useful to
our audience.

In addition to the keynote, twelve presentations and a closing event, we

separate room, directly after their talk for more detailed Q and A.

We'll also have a 'resume room' where other information security
professionals and placement consultants will help you with your resume,
career choices, skill set and training decisions.

And of course it's always been a great opportunity to meet and talk with
other application security professionals.

We'll also have a raffle at the closing for sponsor and OWASP prizes.

See you there!

Subject: [Owasp-boston] BASC 2015 InfoSec Communication Workshop
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKn_2r0WKEjWDcB6stqHFntKKGt8KD8FVfe5-HXHzekrYg@mail.gmail.com>

More value from BASC 2015 - Rob Cheyne will be conducting a workshop on
teaching information security after his keynote. You can sign up for it
when you check in. It will take place from 10 - 12, in one of the MS NERD
rooms not used for the presentations and we may have 2  one hour sessions,
depending on how many people sign up.

*InfoSec Communication Workshop*

Rob Cheyne

CEO, Big Brain Security

Executive Director, SOURCE Conference



When presenting, teaching, or leading a discussion on technical topics, a
big part of the secret to success is the ability to clearly explain
technical information, and the impact it has on business risks. For some
this comes more naturally than others, but this is absolutely a learnable
skill.



In the time I?ve been teaching, I have had to come up with many ways of
explaining information security concepts (both technical and non-technical)
to vastly different audiences in a way that everyone gets it. In some
cases, I?ve even been tasked with teaching security to hostile audiences,
and had to figure out ways to get them to care.



One of the most important skills you can develop is the ability to explain
something technical in a way that everyone can follow along, while
simultaneously persuading your audience to care what you are talking about
and leave them wanting more.



The formula often boils down to:

            - using specific strategies to keep everyone engaged

            - conveying a story

            - clearly explaining the *necessary* details, and *only* the
necessary details

            - not condescending to the technical folks in the room with
overly simplistic explanations

            - simultaneously not leaving the less technical (or
non-technical) folks in the room behind



This workshop session will provide you with practical tips and tricks for
doing exactly this, and also provide some opportunities for practice.
Practice makes perfect!



Please join Rob in this highly interactive workshop for a deeper dive down
the security communication rabbit hole and experience a new way of
communicating.
