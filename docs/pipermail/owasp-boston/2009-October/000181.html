<PRE>We'll be meeting at Microsoft in Waltham as usual. See
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston</A> for directions. 

 

Main Presentation - From Rivals to BFF: WAF &amp; VA Unite

For years there was a debate in the Web application and data security
world about which approaches are best - black box, white box, SDLC, VA
services/software, Web Application Firewalls (WAF), etc. While it is
true that with a limited budget anything can become competitive - a new
copy machine versus a new coffee machine, the core value propositions of
WAF and VA are distinct and complementary. This presentation will
illustrate how integrating these solutions can enable more secure Web
application development and operations.

 

Speaker - Paul Schofield has over twelve  years of experience in
Information Security and Risk Management. He is currently a Senior
Security Engineer with Imperva.  Paul has broad business and technical
experience ranging from mergers and acquisitions to incident response
and investigations. He is a frequent public speaker, a member of several
professional organizations, and because of his diverse background he
brings insightful perspectives to security and risk management
discussions.

 

Paul is also a regular OWASP Boston attendee so he knows our non-product
orientation and he's pretty good at talking about what is happening in
the industry and why.

 

We'll have some networking and general tool discussion before the main
presentation.
