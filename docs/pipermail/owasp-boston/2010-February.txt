	Scanner Report
Message-ID: <09DED73804A95B42ACFEFF57AEA3B24E0791A456@MAIL3.AD.Brown.Edu>

Has anyone had a chance to read it yet?  Or have opinions on it?  I know
last time he released his report (2007), it was widely criticized.  

 

If you haven't seen it, it is here:

http://ha.ckers.org/files/Accuracy_and_Time_Costs_of_Web_App_Scanners.pd
f

 

if you're worried about a link to a pdf in an email like this, you can
see it on this page:

http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20100203/accuracy-and-time-costs-of-web-applica
tion-security-scanner-report/

 

As I am currently in the market for a scanning tool, I'm looking for any
and all information from all sources on this sort of thing.

 

Thanks!

 

Patrick

Observations:
1. Fully agree that these scanners can not find all the issues on their
own test websites. When questioned, one vendor spun it thus: "This means
we are not rigging the test"

2. I did not see the point of the debate in 2007 because 90% of users
have no clue what to do with these scanners and just point and shoot
them. Most training they get is 1 hour with the SE so I am perfectly
willing to accept that as the methodology.

3. While purists may not like this, I would have liked to see a
price/performance comparison included. Yes, Burp Suite does not support
JavaScript and has other problems; but for $200, I contend that for a
small company and a skilled user it offers great value

Re #3, it?s not quite that simple. You have to factor in the salary of a skilled penetration tester versus a tool operator.  That?s a pretty significant cost differential.

Right. Which is why I said "for a small company and a skilled user"
