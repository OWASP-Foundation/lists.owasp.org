Hello security enthusiasts,

The IEEE Secure Development Conference 2018 is coming up! The conference
will be Sunday, Sept. 30 through Tuesday, Oct. 2 at the Hyatt Regency in
Cambridge.

The SecDev Organizing Committee is pleased to announce a $150 discount off
conference admission for OWASP members! When you register, choose "OWASP
Member" from the pull-down menu and have your OWASP membership number

- the rate for IEEE member is better.

IEEE SecDev is an exciting conference with papers from both industry and
academe. Some of the tutorial sessions are filling up, so register ASAP to
