Hi Folks,
We have 2 staff passes (2 people each day) for the InfoSecurity Conference
in Boston Dec. 6 and 7.
http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/conferences/boston-agile-cybersecurity/

You need to sit at our table for some part of each day and do the usual
thing of talking about what OWASP is and does. There will be lots of swag
to hand out. I'll be there part of one or both days to help out in addition
to the 2 staff people. Everything will be delivered to the conference
venue, if not directly to our table.

If you'd like to staff the table one or both days please let me know your
name and what day.

Thanks, Jim
