<PRE>Sorry for the late notice - 

 

Josh Abraham from Rapid 7 will do a  great presentation - 

 

Title: Owning the world, one mobile app at a time.

 

Description: 

 

This presentation will cover the process of penetration testing SOAP web
services as well as mobile applications. We will discuss common design
flaws as well as recommendations.

 

Location and Directions - 

 

Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,
Sixth Floor Waltham, MA

 

&gt;<i>From Rt. 128 North take exit 26 toward Waltham, East up the hill on Rt.
</I>20, stay in the left lane. From Rt 128 South take exit 26 but go around
the rotary to get to 20 East to Waltham, stay in the left lane up the
hill. Follow signs for Rt. 117 (left at the second light). When you get
to 117 turn left (West). You will cross back over Rt. 128. Jones Rd.
Continue west about 0.1 mile from the Rt. 128 (I95) overpass (look for
the Waltham Weston Corporate Center sign on the left). Jones Rd. is the
second left, at a blinking yellow light, on Rt. 117.  The office
building is at the bottom of Jones Rd. Best parking is to turn right
just before the building and park in the back. Knock on the door to get
the security guard to open it. The room is MPR C.
