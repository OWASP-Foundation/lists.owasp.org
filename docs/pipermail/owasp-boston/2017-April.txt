Hi Folks,

We have Veterans and Active Military members who have signed up for the
free seats generously set aside by the trainer.  We need your help in
ensuring this class runs!    Please spread the word and sign up for this
great training event!

OWASP Boston is hosting Web App Security training with Venue Sponsor Dun &
Bradstreet in Waltham.  Some training topics covered:

Injection Attacks
Automated Scanners
Testing Web Services
Monitoring Implementation
Monitoring, Analysis & Tuning
Log review
Tuning and signature development
Response
Preparing for an incident
Finding signs of compromise
Student Scavenger Hunt Challenge

This three-day course is designed to improve a person?s skills with
manually testing web applications and monitoring the resulting logs. This
course is focused on providing both testing and detection skills for
attendees. The training is structured as a hands-on proficiency course,
such that IT professionals of all skill levels should benefit. The course
leverages the Samurai WTF environment as a test lab, and primarily focuses
on the skillful use of interception proxies (Burp or ZAP) to efficiently
perform tests. It also helps build detection and monitoring techniques to
discover attacks against your web applications and infrastructure. The
course culminates with a live-fire capture the flag that focuses on both
testing the target application as well as reviewing real-world application
logs for attacks.

Hey everyone!

Sorry for the super long layoff, I have been slacking in scheduling our
meetings, but we're back on! We will have our next meeting on Wednesday,
April 12th at 6:30 pm at Upserve, 10 Dorrance St. in Providence.

As for the OWASP meeting:

Using Instrumentation and Sensors to drive Optimization in your Application
Security Program

In our physical world, we have instrumentation all around us. Clocks tell
us time, kitchen ovens tell us temperature, cars tell us speed, fuel level
and even has onboard health diagnostics. At our homes, we have security
alerts when someone trespasses our property or opens a door. However, in
the world of software, we have very little visibility into what is going on
inside the software. Our presenters will describe how instrumentation can
be used to enable your software applications to both detect vulnerabilities
and block attacks. Furthermore, they will demonstrate the insights offered
by using instrumentation and why this approach can offer unique insights to
your security program.

Bio: Jon Seidman has been a software developer for more than a decade. He
has special interest in web related technologies and application security.
He has a Master?s degree in computer science, and is a CISSP. He currently
works for Contrast Security, where he evangelizes their technology.

Hope to see you there!

6:15 - 6:45 - Chapter and OWASP events and news, audience announcements,
questions, application security news(Google and Symantec certs, HTML5,
Chrome features, SDLC and Microservices, others?)

6:50 pm Main Presentation
Title - Random Number Generation - Lava Lamps, Clouds, New Standards and
the IoT

The SANS Institute recently listed "Weak random number generators" as one
of the 7 most dangerous security techniques to watch in 2017. But how do
you really know how good your random numbers are? Virtualization and IoT
make things worse and new standards are a wake-up call. Random numbers are
the basis of security for all cryptography, yet they are often taken for
granted. Without entropy, crypto is just math.
Learn why random numbers are so hard to generate and validate, compare
different technologies in use today across virtualized environments, and
discuss operational steps to take the risk out of random numbers and help
secure cryptosystems even into the era of quantum computers.

BIO - Richard Moulds, General Manager of Whitewood Security, has spoken at
RSA 2017 and at several OWASP chapter events in New York, Chicago and
Austin. Richard has over 20 years of experience in the area of cryptography
and encryption.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] IEEE Secure Development Conference in Cambridge,
	24-26 September 2017
Message-ID: <4742505eb690453590e237b79a90b09a@XCGVAG23.northgrum.com>

All,

I'd like to encourage your participation in the upcoming IEEE Secure Development Conference this fall. It will be held 24-26 September 2017 right locally in Cambridge, MA. The call for papers is currently open (overview pasted below; deadline May 30th), and the conference includes some great tutorials, keynotes and both regular and lightning talks. SecDev focuses on defensive content, "building security in," and on engagement between industry and research communities.

Conference website: https://secdev.ieee.org/2017/home/

I attended last year, and really enjoyed it, so this year I am helping to organize the con. You can get a taste for the topics addressed by looking at last year's program:  https://secdev.ieee.org/2016/program/. Highlights for me were the tutorial by Kostya Serebryany (Google) on "Dynamic Testing Techniques Continuous fuzzing with libFuzzer and AddressSanitizer" and the keynote by Jonathan Katz (U Maryland) on "How to Think about Cryptography: Common Crypto Flaws and How to Avoid Them." There were many other good papers though too, and as a smaller conference, it provided excellent opportunities to connect with folks both locally and from across the world.

Archer

Call For Papers Overview
Submission deadline: 30 May 2017
Full CfP: https://secdev.ieee.org/2017/papers/

SecDev is a venue for presenting ideas, research, and experience about how to develop secure systems.

SecDev is distinguished by its focus on the theory, techniques, and tools for how to "build security in" to computing systems, and not simply discover the absence of security. Its goal is to encourage and disseminate ideas for secure system development between both academia and industry. Developers have valuable experiences and ideas that can inform academic research, and researchers have concepts, studies, and even code and tools that could benefit developers. Great SecDev contributions could come from attendees of industrial conferences like AppSec, RSA, Black Hat, and Shmoocon; from attendees of academic conferences like IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, PLDI, FSE, ISSTA, SOUPS, and others; and from newcomers.

SecDev is soliciting two types of contributions. First, SecDev is a forum for short papers that present innovations, experience-based insights, or a vision about how to build security in to existing and new computing systems. New work is encouraged. A summary of an ongoing research agenda is also welcome. Second, SecDev is also interested in tutorials on processes, frameworks, languages, and tools for building security in. The goal is to propose useful and thought-provoking ideas, and to share knowledge on the art and science of secure systems development.

Areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

    Security engineering processes, from requirements to maintenance
    Security-focused system designs (HW/SW/architecture)
    Distributed systems design and implementation for security
    Human-centered design for systems security
    Programming languages, development tools, and ecosystems supporting security
    Risk management and testing strategies to improve security
    Static program analysis for software security
    Dynamic analysis and runtime approaches for software security
    Explorations of formal verification and other high-assurance methods for security
    Automation of programming, deployment, and maintenance tasks for security
    Code reviews, red teams, and other human-centered assurance
