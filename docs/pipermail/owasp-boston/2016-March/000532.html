<PRE>Hi all,

On April 7th, we will have a return of a very special guest from last year.
Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin will come and talk to us about the
state of US Cybersecurity. Congressman Langevin is the co-chair of the
House Cybersecurity Caucus and the Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence, and is very focused on US cybersecurity issues. This meeting
will begin at 6:30 pm

I know parking can be an issue downtown, especially now that the city has
extended the parking meters to 9 pm. A couple options are to keep circling
looking for a metered spot, there are parking garages in the area,
including down by the family court house. Another option some have
mentioned, if you don't mind a 10 minute walk is to park at the mall. It
will cost $2 when you leave, but it will be easy. There isn't much free
parking left downtown unfortunately.

On May 12, we will have Steve Carmody from Brown University coming to speak
on single-sign on mechanisms. He is the chair of the Shibboleth project and
has worked with SAML, OAuth, Federated Identity and other similar SSO
methods.

The meetings are at our host's offices, Upserve (formerly Swipely) 10
Dorrance St. Providence, 6:30 pm. Please RSVP at

Thank you and see you next week!

Patrick
