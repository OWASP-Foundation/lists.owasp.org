<PRE>Hi everyone, we have two great meetings coming up.

First, this month on Thursday, March 24th, we will have &quot;Online Security
for Kids&quot;. This one will be a little different from our usual meetings.
First, it's for kids! So please bring your kids, we'll have pizza and
drinks available for all. The meeting will start a little earlier, at 6 pm,
and the presentation is targeted to be just 30 minutes. What makes it even
better is the presentation will be delivered by a 10 year old. So it's for
kids, by a kid!

On April 7th, we will have a return of a very special guest from last year.
Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin will come and talk to us about the
state of US Cybersecurity. Congressman Langevin is the co-chair of the
House Cybersecurity Caucus and the Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence, and is very focused on US cybersecurity issues. This meeting
will begin at our usual 6:30 pm start time.

Please RSVP at
<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/">http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/</A>

We have openings for meeting topics from May forward, if there is something
you would like to present, or know someone who would.

Also some other exciting news, our host Swipely has changed their name to
Upserve. So meetings are still held at 10 Dorrance Street in Providence, at
Upserve's headquarters. Upserve generously supplies the pizza and drinks as
well as the meeting space.

Thank you and we will see you soon!
