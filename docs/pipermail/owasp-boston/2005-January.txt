Subject: [Owasp-boston] need OWASP Boston meeting location
Message-ID: <0B19E38B5321484097D6118BDF3CFCCDBCED74@fraex20.staples.com>

Hello Everyone,
I'm helping to get the OWASP Boston chapter running, and the first thing we
need is a regular place to meet in Boston, or at least inside Rt. 128. If
you have any suggestions, or you can volunteer a meeting room at your
workplace once a month in the evening, please let me know. With 22 people on
this list, and some publicity, I'm guessing we could have 15 - 30 people at
meetings, and possibly 50. Once we get a location and a regular meeting date
we can start planning meeting content.
 
Thanks, Jim

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston first meeting
Message-ID: <0B19E38B5321484097D6118BDF3CFCCDBCEDDC@fraex20.staples.com>

Hi Folks,
I wanted to get this notice out as soon as possible so you could put it on
your calendar. The first meeting will have some time talking about what we
want to do and how you can help. I'll have a handout with my favorite
sources of info and we can exchange other sources and talk about them. I
think we can have a presentation too, either me talking about Web
Application Vulnerability scanners or something else.
 
A format I've seen work is -
 
6 - 6:45  - informal topic. I was planning to go over one of the OWASP top
10 every meeting for the first 10. This time slot is also useful if we get a
last minute speaker or visitor that we want to talk to, but don't want to
change the main presentation, which may have been planned for weeks and
attendees may be planning to see.
 
6:45 - 7  technical questions on any topic, problems, etc.
 
7 - 7:30  group business, announcements, break
 
7:30 - 9  main presentation
 
The Boston OWASP Chapter will be meeting at the Microsoft offices at the
Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd., Sixth Floor Waltham, MA.  
Jones Rd. (look for the Waltham Weston Corporate Center sign) is the second
left, at a blinking yellow light, on Rt. 117 going west about 0.1 miles from
Rt. 128 (I95).  The office building is at the bottom of Jones Rd.
The room is MPR C. 
 
We will meet the first Wednesday of every month, starting Feb. 2, 6 to 9 pm.
 
Meeting topics will be posted soon.
