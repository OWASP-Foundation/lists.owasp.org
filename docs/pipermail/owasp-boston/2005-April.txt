Presentation description - 
Building Enterprise Trust 
Governance Built on a Foundation of Web Services Security 
Enterprises still proclaim security as the number one concern in their plans
to deploy Web services. Who can blame them? Without proper security
infrastructure in place, Web services can expose sensitive corporate
processes and information and leave a company open to risk and
malfeasance-from both internal and external perpetrators. 
This seminar-based on the SAMS book by the speaker called Securing Web
Services with WS-Security-makes it quite a bit easier to comprehend all the
facets of Web Services Security; plus, it aggregates information on all the
underlying and associated security technologies that WS-Security relies on,
such as SSL, PKI, XKMS, SAML, and a host of other acronyms.  A pragmatic
approach is taken showing which Web Services Security standards are needed
when faced with a variety of security challenges. Most importantly, the
author will try to help everyone understand the vastly different but
critical new way of thinking about security: its about persistent
message-level security not about perimeters or application access control.
Ultimately we use SOA and Web services to create new channels for business.
Business requires Trust and Trust is built on the security concepts
discussed in this seminar. But Trust also requires governance which is the
exercise of authority, management and control. The mechanism for
implementing, policing and enforcing policy must itself fit in to the Web
services fabric on which our SOA-based composite applications will be build
for the foreseeable future. This seminar will conclude with a detailed
discussion of such a system. This one-hour seminar is broken down into four
15-minute segments:
o	Why Web Services Need Security: a review of distributed
message-level security
o	Basic Web Services Security Building Blocks: XML Signature, XML
Encryption and SAML
o	Practical use of WS-Security and WS-Policy to build security into
SOAP
o	Governing Web Services Security, Policy and Compliance


Jonathan Levin
Jonathan has lots of experience in this area but is speaking as an 'informed
individual' and not as a representative of any security company, and he
doesn't play one on TV.
Presentation Description -
Jonathan will discuss the importance of Random numbers to information
security in general, and web application security in particular. Drawing on
real world examples such as DNS poisoning and TCP sequence number
generation, to a detailed discussion of Session and GUID (Globally unique
Identifier) generation, and describing statistical attacks such as the
birthday attack. Finally, the talk will be concluded by a discussion of hash
functions, their possible use in session identifiers, and recent
developments (e.g. the MD5/SHA-1 "hacks"). 

Jonathan and I have talked a little about differences in session management
between Microsoft IIS and IBM Websphere Commerce server so if you're
interested in either of those platforms this will be a useful discussion.

I try to remember to send these emails out in plain text because I'm
assuming there are some text only email readers out there.

Bring business cards for a raffle of Microsoft home software.

Hi Folks,


********************   May 4 Meeting   **********************************
Patrick Hynds, CTO of CriticalSites, Microsoft Regional Director, MCSE+I,
MCSD, MCDBA, MCP+Site Builder, MCT
will give a presentation on passwords.

Passwords: Keys to the Kingdom
Passwords can be your friend, but more often they are your enemy. In this
session we discuss the fatal mistakes made by organizations and specifically
developers relative to password creation, storage and policy.  This session
has something for everyone, developers and network admins alike so long as
they are interested in keeping their systems secure.

I've seen Patrick speak and he's a very knowledgable and entertaining guy
with lots of experience and interesting stories. He's also given lots of
presentations in the Microsoft room we meet in so he's very familiar with
the room, which is useful for this meeting because I won't be there. I'll be
taking the first public offering of Foundstone's Java Security class in
Dallas; I'll let you know how the class went. I'll have to save the
remaining Microsoft giveaway software for the June meeting.


*********************  June 1 Meeting   *******************
Fishnet Security is an information security solutions provider and they've
recently opened a New England office in Westboro. One of their top technical
guys, Arian Evans will be presenting and he wanted to know which of 3
possible topics would be of interest, so send me or the OWASP Boston list an
email stating your preferences - 

1. Secrets of Session Attacks and Strong Session Handling
 
New ways to attack webapps, new ways to implement dynamic tokens and
entrypoints to defend the session which has the added benefit of stopping
the vast majority of XSS exploitation and breaking automated scanners/webapp
hacking tools.
 
2. Tools of the Trade:
 
This is an overview of the OWASP Tools project which I lead. It basically
outlines application security, provides a taxonomy of seven types of ways to
test applications, and breaks down all the tools that are available and
which testing categories they fit into. This came about as a response to all
the vendor FUD and answering the same questions over and over; wanted to
create a single, independent resource on tools and testing techniques.
 
3. Flash Forward:
 
This is new research on next-generation UIs (Flash, Windows Avalon) and what
binary formats and vector-based rendering mean to security (changes the
scanning game, no arbitrary javascript injection/XSS or related silliness,
etc.) and to application design.


*********************  Group News   *************
Don't forget all OWASP Boston group members get a 20% discount on O'Reilly,
No Starch, Paraglyph, Pragmatic Bookshelf, SitePoint, and Syngress books and
O'Reilly conferences. Just use code DSUG.

The presentations from the April meeting by Jon Levin and Jothy Rosenberg
should be on the OWASP Boston site by this weekend.

6:30 seems like a more convenient time for everyone so we'll move the
meeting time for the meetings to 6:30.
