<PRE>Main Topic - Open SAMM - Software Assurance Maturity Model

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) project is committed to
building a usable framework to help organizations formulate and
implement a strategy for application security that's tailored to the
specific business risks facing the organization. The goal is to create
well-defined and measurable goals that can be used by small, medium,and
large sized organizations in any line of business that involves software
development. The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) project is

Comments about Open SAMM - 

&quot;From a consultant's perspective, it's impressive to our clients that
OpenSAMM has been approved not only by us but also by a number of our
industry peers,&quot; said Matt Bartoldus, a Director at Gotham Digital
Science, an information security consulting firm. &quot;Plus, its versatility
enables us to apply it to our full range of clients, regardless of the
size, type of software or method of development.&quot;

 

&quot;I have conducted, sold and project managed SAMM engagements to
financial service (FS) organisations throughout Europe over the past
years. It is obvious the demand is growing for such services. The rise
in demand of  &quot;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-boston">security at source</A>&quot; be it via code review, secure
development or grey box penetration testing and a supporting framework
to tie it all together and understandably so as SAMM is one of the first
pragmatic benchmarking and assessment frameworks for the somewhat
ancient &quot;Security in the SDLC&quot; challenge.  &quot;

Eoin Keary, runs the Ernst &amp; Young application security team across
Europe.
