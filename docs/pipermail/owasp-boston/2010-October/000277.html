Overview:

In this highly interactive two-part workshop, Rob Cheyne of Safelight
Security will show you the basics of conducting a real-world
architecture &amp; design review. 

This workshop draws from Safelight's Security Architecture Fundamentals
training course, a two-day course frequently used to teach Fortune 500
companies how to look at their system architectures from both the
hacker's and the designer's point of view.  

First session:

In the first session on October 6, Rob discusses a practical approach to
architecture review and threat modeling using real-world examples. This
session lays the foundation for participants to participate in a
real-world architecture review in the December session. 

Attendees will learn:

            - How to holistically examine a system architecture for
security issues from both the designer's and the hacker's point of view

            - To identify frequently overlooked areas where security
vulnerabilities commonly occur

            - Tips for assessing a system at the host-level, network
level, and application level

            - Practical ways to apply threat modeling to help manage
risk 

Second session:

In the December 1st session, Rob will conduct a sample architecture
assessment against a real-world system, and in the process, teach
participants how to conduct an architecture of their own.  Brave
volunteers will be welcome to share their own architectures and have
them reviewed. This is an opportunity to get free consulting that
typically costs thousands of dollars.  There is limited time, so not
every one will get chosen.  If you are interested in this, please
contact Rob Cheyne (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-boston">rcheyne at safelightsecurity.com</A>) directly.

 Who should attend?

Anyone can participate and learn from the discussion in this accessible
and dynamic workshop.  Whether you are an architect, a developer, or a
manager, there will be something here for you.  Come learn to challenge
your assumptions.

Additional information:

Penetration testing is a common way to evaluate an application's
security.  Yet a comprehensive architecture and design assessment can
uncover critical security issues that often cost far less to resolve
early on in a project.  Many companies overlook this element of system
design.

Rob was one of a select few at security consulting company @stake who
regularly led and conducted full-blown enterprise-level architecture
assessments for Fortune 500 companies.  Drawing from his experience with
dozens of real-world architecture assessments over the past 12 years,
and his 20 years as a software developer, architect, and consultant, Rob
teaches students to challenge assumptions that frequently lead to
long-term security and reliability problems.
