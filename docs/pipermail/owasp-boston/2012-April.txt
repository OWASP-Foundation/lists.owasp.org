Hi, we're looking for some QSA Recommendations. We're especially interested in ones who have experience with tokenization and end-to-end encryption (e2ee). Does anybody have any recommendations/suggestions?

Topic - Gray, the New Black: Gray-Box Vulnerability Testing 

Over the years, two key techniques have emerged as the most effective
for finding security vulnerabilities in software: Dynamic Application
Security Testing (DAST) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST).
While DAST and SAST each possess unique strengths, the "Holy Grail" of
security testing is thought to be "hybrid" - a technique that combines
and correlates the results from both testing methods, maximizing the
advantages of each. Until recently, however, a critical element has been
missing from first generation hybrid solutions: information about the
inner workings and behavior of applications undergoing DAST and SAST
analysis. 

This presentation will introduce you to the next generation of hybrid
security analysis - what it is, how it works, and the benefits it
offers. It will also address (and dispel) the claims against hybrid, and
leave you with a clear understanding of how the new generation of hybrid
will enable organizations to resolve their most critical software
security issues faster and more cost-effectively than any other
available analysis technology. 

Pizza will be sponsored by HP / Fortify

Hello Akshat: 

We've had very good experience with PSC: 
<http://www.paysw.com/company/Company_ManagementTeam.php> 

They have worked with us on tokenization and end-to-end encryption. 
Our primary business contact is Tom Arnold. 
Been using them for about six years now.
