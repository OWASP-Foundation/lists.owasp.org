Dear Hackers and Security Gurus!

Greetings from hardwear.io Conference 2017!

We?re glad to announce that hardwear.io 2017 Call For Papers is now
open! We are seeking innovative research on hardware security. If you
have done interesting research on attacks or mitigation on any
Hardware and want to showcase it to the security community, just
submit your research paper. Please find all the relevant details for
the submission below.

hardwear.io Security Conference (http://hardwear.io/) is a platform
for hardware and security community where researchers showcase and
discuss their innovative research on attacking and defending hardware.
The objective of the conference revolves around four key concerns in
hardware, firmware and related protocols i.e. backdoors, exploits,
trust and attacks (BETA).

1.Travel Reimbursement (Either actuals or the below mentioned amounts,
whichever is less)
a. Speaker travelling from outside Europe (Based on actuals or Euro
1000 whichever is less)
b. Speaker travelling from within Europe (Based on actuals or Euro 250

Subject: [Owasp-boston] Finally, OWASP RI Returns! April 12th, 6:30 pm
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEAKLxsdSX51_CP=uMG9XXwmGKCRAoDUU6FvW6szW+WoHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone!

Sorry for the super long layoff, I have been slacking in scheduling our
meetings, but we're back on! We will have our next meeting on Wednesday,
April 12th at 6:30 pm at Upserve, 10 Dorrance St. in Providence.

First, one other tidbit. I've been looking to restart the old DefCon401
group, but I'm looking for a space to hold it. If you know of a space that
will host us, please let me know.

As for the OWASP meeting:

Using Instrumentation and Sensors to drive Optimization in your Application
Security Program

In our physical world, we have instrumentation all around us. Clocks tell
us time, kitchen ovens tell us temperature, cars tell us speed, fuel level
and even has onboard health diagnostics. At our homes, we have security
alerts when someone trespasses our property or opens a door. However, in
the world of software, we have very little visibility into what is going on
inside the software. Our presenters will describe how instrumentation can
be used to enable your software applications to both detect vulnerabilities
and block attacks. Furthermore, they will demonstrate the insights offered
by using instrumentation and why this approach can offer unique insights to
your security program.

Bio: Jon Seidman has been a software developer for more than a decade. He
has special interest in web related technologies and application security.
He has a Master?s degree in computer science, and is a CISSP. He currently
works for Contrast Security, where he evangelizes their technology.

Hope to see you there!
