Hi Folks,

We'd like to announce that the OWASP Boston chapter is supporting the
Diversity & Inclusivity event for cybersecurity called the Day of Shecurity
Conference in Boston, happening Feb. 22, 2019, at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston!

Registration is open. Visit www.dayofshecurity.com to register. Attendance
is free, all that we ask is that all registrants verify that they are
eligible to attend by reviewing our Self-Vetting criteria prior to signing
up.

We need help from the community to make this event as big and broad as
possible. We are currently registering volunteers who can support on the
day of the event. https://www.dayofshecurity.com/volunteer

Our call for Sponsors is also open. There are a limited number of Gold
Sponsor tables and a handful of great sponsors already signed on to support
like Tuft?s University, Rapid7, IBM and more. These sponsor tables are
expected to sell out soon. Online-only sponsorships are also available for
those who want to support but aren?t in Boston. To see all the ways you can
support, check out our sponsorship page.

If you use social media, we ask that you like, share, retweet and otherwise
support Day of Shecurity! We are @DayofShecurity on Twitter, our LinkedIn
group is called ?Day of Shecurity? and we are using the hashtags
#DayofShecurity #DayofShecurityBoston #DosBoston #DosBos2019

Thank you for helping us influence the cybersecurity community one event at
a time!
