Access in Maliceland - Risk Based Access Control
John Lambert observed attackers win because while defenders think in lists,
attackers think in graphs. Access control systems divide the system a
priori into secure and insecure states. But that&#8217;s only worth the paper its
printed on. A  Attackers see the system as it is, for attackers, the access
control scheme is the beginning of the game not the end. Determined
attackers seek out access control models and then find holes that they can
leverage. Access control systems that purport to protect the system are
built on assumptions from which reality diverges. Application security
needs a new approach to access control- adding feedback loops for risk
based decisions,  fine-grained, dynamic access control.

Security is a business with a very long list of issues and requirements.
The spreadsheets are miles long. This makes it essential to find reusable
solution patterns that can address multiple problems.This presentation
looks at both medium term improvements and code examples to improve access
control decisions and overall security today


Gunnar Peterson (@oneraindrop) focuses on security architecture consulting
and training. Experience includes Associate Editor for IEEE Security &amp;
Privacy Journal, a Microsoft MVP for App security, an IANS Research Faculty
member, a Securosis Contributing Analyst, and a Visiting Scientist at
Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute. He maintains a popular
