<PRE>*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. June 6  
 
ToolTalk: Jim Weiler
WebGoat and Crosssite Request Forgeries
 
In keeping with our theme of 'experience, not just technology', Danny Allen
will be talking about exploits they've seen and software changes they've
seen that make a difference.
 
Main Speaker: 
Danny Allan; Director, Security Research, Watchfire

Topic: 
Exploitation of the OWASP Top 10: Attacks and Strategies
 
We often talk about the vulnerabilities that make up the OWASP Top 10, but
sometimes we lack the awareness of how the true exploitations actually take
place.  A vulnerability is a very different thing from an exploit.  This
presentation will demonstrate some of the more advanced exploitation
techniques we are seeing around the OWASP Top 10 and how the Web 2.0 world
has opened a world of opportunity.  We will also discuss some of the small
changes an organization can do to be more effective in securing online
software.  It's easy to talk about secure software, but it's often hard to
know where to start.  What are the simple steps we have witnessed that have
made the largest difference?&quot;
 
Pizza will be provided by Watchfire
