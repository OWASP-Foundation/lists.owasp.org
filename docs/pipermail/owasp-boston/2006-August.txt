1. UPCOMING MEETINGS 


	As you probably know, NEISG is on summer vacation through the end of
August. However, here is the September through November lineup:

	September 21: Trusted Computing (presented by Wave Systems)
Trusted computing promised the industry a secure future for enterprises and
users. Gone would be the panic attacks over lost laptops containing customer
data, credit card information or sensitive files. Users would be liberated
from remembering multiple complex passwords that must be changed regularly.
Files would be safely stored without the threat of unauthorized user access
or hacking theft. Trusted network access control would authenticate
machines, users and even a PC's health in milliseconds, before even allowing
a PC onto secure networks. 

	The promises still sound futuristic, but the reality is here today,
with nearly every major PC manufacturer shipping computers with the Trusted
Platform Module (TPM) chip in mass volume. The TPM enhances the security of
critical capabilities such as login, email, web access and data protection.
The chip is placed in a PC and protects secrets by hardware that would
otherwise be more vulnerable and only be protected by software.

	Key topics will include:
> A practical roadmap to incremental deployment of TPM computers in the
enterprise
> Benefits of turning on trusted computing: Leveraging TPM hardware for
advanced data protection, network protection, identity protection and more

	> Impact upon traditional/existing security strategies: What's
enhanced, and what's displaced?
> Managing trusted computers: >From key management and recovery, to
extending the trusted architecture to servers, storage and more.

	October 19: The World of Cyber Terrorism (presented by Mazu
Networks) - details on our Web site ( <http://www.neisg.org>
http://www.neisg.org) 
November 16: Cyber Surveillance and Monitoring - Brad Dinerman will moderate
this session to include both discussion and demonstration of corporate
and/or personal monitoring of computer systems. Is it ethical? What should
you put into place before monitoring users' email, chat sessions and more?
What applications provide this functionality, and what can we do to locate
and stop unauthorized installations? (Also: We need demonstrations. If
interested, let me know.)

2. NEISG INTERVIEW ON TECHNET RADIO

your network, behind your firewall.

is a ZeroFootprint(tm) solution. The VQS(tm) works with most existing
firewalls and smart switches to block problems at ports, not people and
