I am resending this announcement.  I've been informed that it may have been
slightly scrambled during the first attempt.  It may have been bad HTML
formatting, not encrypted, but ultimately the same effect... no one can read
it.

	A> "Patch Management and Real-World Security Measures:" Jack Daniel,
a regular at our NEISG meetings and frequent contributor to the TechTips
list, will discuss his recent experiences deploying and supporting Microsoft
patches on PCs running incompatible applications.  This will be a starting
point to continue NEISG's ongoing conversation about patch management and
the impact on real-world security measures.  Examples of both frustrations
and practical solutions will be provided to and solicited from the members
in attendance.

2.  MAY AND JUNE MEETINGS  


	The May meeting will be held on Thursday the 18th.  The presentation
will be provided by Andrew Briney; a CISSP, member of the ISSA Hall of Fame
and the vice president and publisher of the TechTarget Security Media Group.
The presentation will be "The State of Security: 2006."  Everyone involved
in security knows that the only constant is change: new threats, new
business demands, new technologies, new roles and responsibilities. These
and other challenges can be quite overwhelming if you don't have a
big-picture perspective on how other professionals in the industry are
dealing with them. In this presentation, Andrew will review the results of
several recent surveys conducted among more than 470,000 IT security
professionals. Taken as a whole, these surveys offer a broad view on the
state of security in 2006, including insight into A) Changes in IT threat
vectors and what to do about them, B) Enterprise security spending drivers,
trends and wish lists, C) How the role of security and the security
professional is changing and D) Five things every security pro must know.

	The June meeting will be held at the Microsoft TechEd conference in
downtown Boston.  In addition to being off-site, it will also be slightly
off-date.  The meeting will occur on Monday, June 12, at 7:00 PM.  This
corresponds to the first full day of the TechEd conference.  The
presentation will be given by the Infragard Division of the United States
FBI.  [Note: You do not need to be a registered attendee of TechEd to attend

*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. May 3  
 
Speaker: Fortify Software
Topic: Application security by wrapping existing executable code
Description: Fortify Application Defense is a software solution that
protects existing J2EE applications from losing private data, leaking
valuable information or performing unwanted tasks caused by the actions of
hackers and malicious insiders. Its patent-pending technology works within
the application itself to monitor and protect against attacks such as SQL
injections, cross-site scripting and request tampering.
JW  summary - Fortify Application Defense can insert filter functions in
front of the external callable functions of Java code, so you can
retroactivly fit existing code with your or Fortify's security logic. 
 
Short Topic - Jim Weiler   -  Open Redirects
This means a web site uses URL parameters to determine where the user will
be redirected to. This vulnerability was exploited in the govbenefits.gov
site a few months ago to propagate a phishing scam. From the Netcraft web
site "Open redirects have not previously been thought of as a security risk,
because they do not allow access to a company's computer systems. However,
fraudsters are actively using open redirects to facilitate their phishing
scams. These tactics are rather analogous to borrowing a bank's sign and
premises to execute a sting."
 
Speaker - Jim Weiler
Topic - Web Application Security with Web Proxy Servers II - Paros
Description - using saved sessions; site crawling and vulnerability scans
 
 
Pizza will be provided by Fortify Software
