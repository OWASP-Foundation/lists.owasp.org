Hi everybody,

Sorry we've been quiet for a couple months but we've been busy lining up
some great talks for the next few months. We have three currently scheduled
that I think you will get excited about:

Feb 25, How to Talk Security in the Boardroom
Mar 24, Online Security for Kids by a Kid
Apr 7, State of US Cybersecurity with Congressman Jim Langevin

All meetings will be held at Swipely, 10 Dorrance St, Providence. Thank you
Swipely!

So you can see we have a great lineup coming.

First, this month, we have John Strand from Black Hill Information Security
to tell us how to talk to your management about security. When talking with
colleagues, we usually have an understanding of what's important and why
and may not need to explain it as much. But when talking to C-level
management, it might require a different tack, a different way of
explaining things. John will tell us ways that he accomplishes this. John
is located in South Dakota, so this presentation will be live streamed.
Meeting will start at 6:30 pm.

Next, on March 24, we will start a half hour early, at 6 pm, because this
one is for the kids! Please bring your kids to this meeting as we will talk
about how to best protect kids online, things to think about and good
online behavior for kids. Even better, the presentation will be by a kid,
10 year old McKenna. It should be a fun session with great information, and
will start at 6, so we don't keep the kids out too late on a school night.

Finally, on April 7, we will have US Congressman Jim Langevin back to talk
to us again about the state of US cybersecurity. He will tell us what
Congress is doing, what bills are being discussed, what he's working on
with regard to computer and network security, as well as take questions
from the audience. We had a similar meeting with the Congressman last year
and it went extremely well. This meeting will start at 6:30 pm.

All meetings, including the one with Congressman Langevin will be held at
Swipely's headquarters, 10 Dorrance Street in Providence. Swipely also
generously provides pizza and refreshments at each session for us.

That's what we have for now, with even more coming as the spring
approaches. Please RSVP either by responding to this email or at
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

Thank you and see you on February 25th!

Just a reminder that we will be meeting this Thursday night with a virtual
presentation from John Strand of Black Hills Information Security to talk
about "How to Talk Security in the Board Room" Information is below. See
you on Thursday!

Hi Mike,

I would be interested in speaking further at my location to grab information: WeWork - 745 Atlantic Avenue near South Station. There is plenty of space for everyone, projector for presentations and whatnot.

The two days might be hard for WeWork (Thursday/Friday) where at (Saturday/Sunday) would be best for this specific location but I can still gather information if you are interested.

Let me know your thoughts I will grab some information in getting this setup.

Best,
Andrew

at both a beginner as well as intermediate/advanced level.

This is a free event.

The event includes informative talks as well as hands-on experiential
activities. With a focus smart home IoT devices, their vulnerabilities and
best practice tools to discover, prevent, and detect cyber attacks on IoT
devices.

Sessions will be available at several levels, ranging from beginners to
experienced hackers. Want to experience the fun of hacking? Join this
hackathon and explore the future of the cybersecurity game in the IoT space.

Sessions -
? Finding existing vulnerabilities through firmware inspection
? Finding zero-day vulnerabilities through protocol fuzzing (this is how
Codenomicon found heartbleed)
