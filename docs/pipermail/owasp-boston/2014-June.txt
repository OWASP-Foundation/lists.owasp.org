Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP RI this Wednesday
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEA22PrvHy-oV4ZWtohS9iCPnTyb52OdEbLjOTjRNYDskw@mail.gmail.com>

Final reminder that if you plan to come to OWASP RI this Wednesday night,
please RSVP back, or use the Meetup page. Thanks and I hope to see you
there Wednesday night! All info below.

--------------

Hey everyone, we have our June meeting coming up. It will be June 11 at
6:30 pm at Swipely, 10 Dorrance Street, 9th floor. Please RSVP to me to
expedite getting past the security desk. Also, we added yet another means
of communication. We're now on Meetup.com!
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

All OWASP meetings are free and open to anyone. Spread the word!

We also have a July meeting scheduled, which you can see below, but if you
want to present in August, we'd love to have you! So here are the details
for June!

June 11, 6:30 pm
Title: Running a non-attributable honeypot system via fly by night VPS
providers

Description: Ben "@innismir" Jackson will talk about cheap VPS providers
and how they make great homes for honeypots in which you can monitor the
ankle biters that poke at your network day in and day out.

Speaker Bio: Ben spends his time enjoying being a husband, dad, and messing
around with anything that has a button on it. He was the author for
"Asterisk Hacking" from Syngress, has spoken at various conferences, and
has appeared on various media outlets discussing security and privacy. Ben
strongly dislikes Thursdays and writing about himself in the third person.

So please RSVP to me and thank you to Swipely for hosting, as pizza and
drinks are provided!

On July 16, we'll have Milandon Foley talking about Point of Sale (POS)
breaches!

Thank you and see you on June 11th!

Personally, one of the biggest challenges in this industry it's training front line developers in security awareness. Then, making that knowledge embedded as part of their daily development mantra. I would love a conversation on thoughts, ideas, and/or successful use cases to make this possible.

A huge echo to this one:

Security test automation with OWASP ZAP and Zest scripting language

And follow the same line with


*         Security Unit testing with Selenium

*         Effective static code analysis tools

If someone would like a topic done on, "Conducting lightweight threat modeling" I just presented at ISACA NE about using the OCTAVE Allegro framework to do a risk assessment. I could make some minor modifications and highlight the threat modelling aspects. Slides are here<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz9j_qHxxTNiN3lpeU1Oa2tBTFE/edit?usp=sharing>

Brians' suggestion of "training front line developers in security
awareness. Then, making that knowledge embedded as part of their daily
development mantra" sounds like a good birds-of-a-feather   peer-to-peer
session.  We?ll have a room for those type of peer to peer sessions with
scheduled discussion topics.

Message-ID: <CAKEaLK=k=PfCwThn3bQWF7wgq=b=dCyXhuxtrXShBKaUWD1oOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,
While OWASP doesn't allow the use of mailing lists for job offers, I think
an exception is warranted because Akamai has been a generous and flexible
host for our chapter meetings for over a year, and this is a unique job
offer. So please look at the description, and reply or forward it to who
ever you think may be interested.

   Akamai Labs is a pure R&D division whose charter is to create the next
generation of enterprise products that will help the secure and scale
Internet delivery far beyond today?s standards. One established Labs team
is responsible for idea generation and execution into viable proof of
concepts and we are hiring a brand new team who will be responsible for
taking those POCs and build an enterprise product from scratch. We are
seeking a Principal Systems Software Engineer who brings advanced security
insight to the role, preferably demonstrated in industry standard groups
like IETF, W3C or any Open Source project that focused on Security:
