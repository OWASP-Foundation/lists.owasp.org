Subject: [Owasp-boston] BASC 2018 is Scheduled for October 27
Message-ID: <CA+XD4xbkKB4yauMZreFeVXh5qxzq5_QOpeWOeox-OuHt-CysvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Please save the date... BASC 2017 will be held on Saturday, October 27,
from 8:30 am-6:30 pm at the Microsoft Technology Center, 5 Wayside Road,
Burlington, MA 01803.  We are currently looking for Sponsors.

The OWASP BASC (Boston Application Security Conference) will be a free, one
day, informal conference, aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge of
application security in the greater Boston area. While many of the
presentations will cover state-of-the-art application security concepts,
the BASC is intended to appeal to a wide range of attendees. Application
security professionals, professional software developers, software quality
engineers, computer science students, and security software vendors will
come to the BASC to learn, interact and hopefully enjoy themselves at the
same time. We encourage local students, security professionals and
academics to present papers as a way to gain exposure and experience in
presenting at security conferences. Further info will be posted to this
site as it becomes available:

Subject: [Owasp-boston] Introduction to Malware Analysis/Malware Reverse
	Engineering?
Message-ID: <CANBiokR_JZ06Yy6xja6Mm7TQg6vmJzECRVqRaqhCf1nVR9y9tg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks

I was looking for someone who might be willing to come and give an entry
level discussion on Malware Analysis/Malware Reverse engineering in the
Boston area.

Would you know anyone who might be willing to give a primer some evening
for say, an hour or so?  The first topic could be "How to set up a lab so
you don't infect yourself" or even "How to get started in Malware Analysis"

Thanks for any tips or introductions!

- Mike

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP RI: Bug Bounties! July 17
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEC-+=zZ76NnEpzvdtTZuCU7LtPBe4QQh-zjJ1Kq_Q+p9Q@mail.gmail.com>

We are back! Sorry for the long, long layoff. But we have Bryan Brannigan
of Upserve to talk to us about the bug bounty program he developed. A
description is below.

I'd love to have more content too. Do you have something you should show in
10 minutes? Nothing big, just a quick explainer or demo? Want to show
people what is XXE? What is a typical Angular template bypass? Anything
would be cool! Or if you have something longer, we can schedule a meeting
for just that! If you have an idea that might not be appsec, we also have
the Defcon401 meeting group that can do things like that too! So let's hear
'em. These groups stay alive and are valuable because of you, the speakers
and the attendees.

Ok, here's the details on the next OWASP RI meeting:

Tuesday, July 17, 6:30 pm, 10 Dorrance St. in Providence, at Upserve.

Bug bounties are a marketplace and like all marketplaces, there are good
sellers (researchers) and buyers (programs), and there bad sellers and
buyers. There are resources everywhere to help researchers get going in
this exciting world of bug hunting, but there are few resources available
to help those running programs. But it is far worse to be a bad program
than it is to be a bad researcher. Let's have a conversation about how
Upserve went from no bounty program to launching a public program (and
beyond!). We'll talk about the speedbumps and the lessons learned along the
way. And you'll learn about how managing a successful bug bounty program is
more about managing expectations and clear communication then it is about
fixing security bugs.

Please RSVP at
https://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/events/252157100/

We will see you there!!

Patrick
