1. OCTOBER MEETING (10/19) 


	A> "The World of CyberTerrorism," by Mazu Networks (
<http://www.mazunetworks.com> http://www.mazunetworks.com) 


	Before September 11, 2001, the world was unaware of the extent of
terrorist attacks. Five years later, terrorists are still actively involved
in areas all across the globe, including the United States.  As technology
advances at a rapid pace, cyber terrorism grows to become a real and
critical threat.  In addition, today's traditional network security
architectures expose vulnerabilities and gaps, inviting cyber terrorists
into the network.

	Fortunately, there are companies that are working to create
technology that helps protect organizations from these kinds of threats. One
example is network behavioral analysis (NBA) systems.  NBA systems provide
another layer of network defense, different from traditional perimeter
security devices like firewalls, IDS and IPS systems.

	This presentation investigates the plausible threats of cyber
terrorism. Attendees will uncover cyber terrorist tactics and strategies and
recognize a terrorist's patterns and behaviors.  In addition, the
presentation will discuss practical steps to help shield networks, and will
highlight how NBA systems, when working in concert with other security
devices, can help defend against cyber terrorist attacks.

B> "Identity Theft, Credit Card Transactions and PCI
Certification/Compliance," by Rapid7 ( <http://www.rapid7.com>
http://www.rapid7.com)

	With identity theft on the rise and the number of online
transactions increasing every month, the threat of cyber crime resulting in
financial loss has hit an all time high. To combat this risk, MasterCard
International has developed the Site Data Protection Program (SDP), which
follows the PCI compliance standards. Now companies conducting online
transactions and storing credit card data can follow regulated standards to
comply with MasterCard's SDP PCI program.

	Learn how to complete the self-assessment documents, identify what
categories MasterCard has set for certain companies and how to comply by
scanning the network for vulnerabilities. Learn how to assess your
environment prior to a third party audit.

>> If you have not yet done so, please send a courtesy e-mail to
BDinerman at neisg.org indicating that you plan to attend the meeting so that
we can order the correct quantity of pizza. This month's pizza will be
sponsored by Rapid7 ( <http://www.rapid7.com> http://www.rapid7.com).

The meeting will be on Thursday, October 19, at 6:30 PM. As usual, it will
be held at the Microsoft office in Waltham, MA. [Directions on our website
at  <http://www.neisg.org> http://www.neisg.org]. The meeting will start
with a general introduction to the user group, followed by an open Q&A
period and then the presentations.

2. UPCOMING MEETING TOPICS 


	Thursday, November 16- 
A> "Cyber Forensics - What To Do When Presented With a Computer That May
Contain Evidence of Criminal Activity," presented by Melissa Royer of
Defender Data Recovery and Forensic Services

	B> "Cyber Surveillance and Employee Monitoring - What Techniques Are
Available And Should We Even Use Them?," presented by Brad Dinerman of MIS
Alliance and NEISG

Sorry Folks,
 I didn't manage to get a speaker for the Nov. meeting. However, in my
search for a Nov. speaker, I have probably lined up speakers for the next 3
months; all very web app security development oriented, not products. As
soon as I get topic descriptions and date confirmations I'll send them out.

Hi Folks,
I've asked the OWASP chapter organizer list if somebody can do something
about the spam to the old sourceforge list. I've also submitted a support
request to Sourceforge about the spam to old lists. There were 2 other
support requests about spam to sourceforge lists, both requests opened
today. I'll let you know when I find out anything more.
