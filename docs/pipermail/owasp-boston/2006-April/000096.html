1. APRIL MEETING 


	The regular, monthly meeting will be on Thursday, April 20 at 6:30
PM.  As usual, it will be held at the Microsoft office in Waltham, MA.
[Directions on our website at  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.neisg.org">http://www.neisg.org</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.neisg.org].">http://www.neisg.org].</A>
The meeting will start with a general introduction to the user group,
followed by an open Q&amp;A period and then the keynote presentations.

	A&gt; &quot;Patch Management and Real-World Security Measures:&quot; Jack Daniel,
a regular at our NEISG meetings and frequent contributor to the TechTips
list, will discuss his recent experiences deploying and supporting Microsoft
patches on PCs running incompatible applications.  This will be a starting
point to continue NEISG's ongoing conversation about patch management and
the impact on real-world security measures.  Examples of both frustrations
and practical solutions will be provided to and solicited from the members
in attendance.

	B&gt; &quot;Legal Implications of E-Mail:&quot; To maintain your organization's
security and integrity, avoid criminal and civil penalties, bad publicity,
and lost business, it is in your best interest to understand e-mail
regulations. It is also important to assess the risk exposure of your
messaging infrastructure, and to develop policies and plans to address
regulatory compliance.  Craig Carpenter of Mirapoint (
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mirapoint.com">http://www.mirapoint.com</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.mirapoint.com">http://www.mirapoint.com</A>) specializes in email
compliance and will assess the security and legal risks to which your
organization is exposed and survey the most important regulations regarding
email.

	&gt;&gt; If you have not yet done so, please send a courtesy e-mail to
<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-boston">BDinerman at neisg.org</A> indicating that you plan to attend the meeting so that
we can order the correct quantity of pizza.  This month's meeting will be
sponsored by Mirapoint ( &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mirapoint.com">http://www.mirapoint.com</A>&gt;

2.  MAY AND JUNE MEETINGS  


	The May meeting will be held on Thursday the 18th.  The presentation
will be provided by Andrew Briney; a CISSP, member of the ISSA Hall of Fame
and the vice president and publisher of the TechTarget Security Media Group.
The presentation will be &quot;The State of Security: 2006.&quot;  Everyone involved
in security knows that the only constant is change: new threats, new
business demands, new technologies, new roles and responsibilities. These
and other challenges can be quite overwhelming if you don't have a
big-picture perspective on how other professionals in the industry are
dealing with them. In this presentation, Andrew will review the results of
several recent surveys conducted among more than 470,000 IT security
professionals. Taken as a whole, these surveys offer a broad view on the
state of security in 2006, including insight into A) Changes in IT threat
vectors and what to do about them, B) Enterprise security spending drivers,
trends and wish lists, C) How the role of security and the security
professional is changing and D) Five things every security pro must know.

	The June meeting will be held at the Microsoft TechEd conference in
downtown Boston.  In addition to being off-site, it will also be slightly
off-date.  The meeting will occur on Monday, June 12, at 7:00 PM.  This
corresponds to the first full day of the TechEd conference.  The
presentation will be given by the Infragard Division of the United States
FBI.  [Note: You do not need to be a registered attendee of TechEd to attend
this meeting, however you will not be able to enter the actual TechEd
seminars or expo unless you have paid separately for those events.  Details
on TechEd are available at  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2006">http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2006</A>&gt;
