Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP RI: May 12 - Two Great Presentations!
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEBSxoi8wFy9Mp1Zo4u5JBbqJwDRS_LQKTRONm26a36UeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

OWASP RI has a couple great meetings coming up. On May 12, we will have two
guests! Steve Carmody come to speak about Single Sign On (SSO) mechanisms
and Federated Identity. We will also have Nat Kopcyk and April Lorenz to
talk about their ongoing research project, Testing Strategies for Faster
Cyber Security Notification.

As always, the meeting will be held at Upserve (formerly Swipely) 10
Dorrance St in Providence, 6:30 pm. Please RSVP for the meeting here:
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/

Steve Carmody is the project lead for the Internet2's Shibboleth (
http://www.internet2.edu/products-services/trust-identity/shibboleth/) and
an IT Architect at Brown University. Steve will speak on single sign on
mechanisms and the idea of federated identity. If you have ever chosen to
use your Google account, Facebook account or Twitter account to log in to
other services, you are familiar with the idea of federated identity. Come
hear more about the projects on May 12.

April and Nat's presentation is  Research: Testing Strategies for Faster
Cyber Security Notification

This is a 3 year research-only project and we have nothing to sell (!) :)

Focus of the project is speed up awareness of IOC/IOV (Indicators of
Compromise or Vulnerability) in the supply chain to critical
infrastructure. Companies that provide goods or services to critical
infrastructure are often too small to join an ISAC and typically don't yet
have a process for effectively handling IOC/IOV notifications.

Then on June 9, we will have Robert Hurlbut talking about Threat Modeling
for Secure Software Design

Threat modeling is a way of thinking about what could go wrong and how to
prevent it. Instinctively, we all think this way in regards to our own
personal security and safety. When it comes to building software, some
software shops either skip the important step of threat modeling in secure
software design or, they have tried threat modeling before but haven't
quite figured out how to connect the threat models to real world software
development and its priorities. In this session, you will learn practical
strategies in using threat modeling in secure software design and how to
apply risk management in dealing with the threats.

It's an exciting couple months and I hope you can attend. See you all on
Thursday, May 12!

1. New Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? is a deep knowledge technical track
that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased (partially or wholly) before, it will fall under
current research category even though there are enhancements/changes
to the original
research.

2. Current Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Submission Format
------------------------------
Email the paper to: cfp at hardwear.io
The subject should be: CFP EU 2016 <Paper Title>
Email Body:
Name
Handle
Talk Category (Mentioned above i.e. research/technical/tool)
Time required (including 5-10 mins of QA)
Paper Title
Country (and City) of residence
Organization and Designation
Contact Number
Have you presented or submitted this paper at any other conference(s),
magazine(s) or portals?
Yes, No.
If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the previous
ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or are due
to be given elsewhere prior to hardwear.io will be considered as current
research category talks unless they consist of cutting edge and ground
breaking technology, which is at the judgement of the review committee.

Are you releasing an open source hardware(or specification)?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the design for review)

Are you releasing an exploit?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the source and vulnerability details for review)

Are you releasing a new vulnerability/Zero-day?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please send us the details, including reproduction procedure,
for review)

Why do you think your paper is different/innovative and how does it
qualify as new work/research(for new Research category only)?

Are there any live demonstrations (These earn you good points during review)?
Yes/No.
(If Yes, how many? Also please explain each demo)

Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

Paper Abstract ? Please provide detailed working or your
research/work. The more details you provide the better it is for the
reviewers. Please keep the abstract to the point. Please do not try to
hide the technical details or say ?I can?t disclose it till bla bla?
as it does not help the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a
low score because of insufficient information available in the
abstract. Please make sure to add as much technical details as
possible as short abstracts also tend to get low score due to
insufficient information.

Note
-------------------------
Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected. The Abstract should
clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail and merely
mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the research
