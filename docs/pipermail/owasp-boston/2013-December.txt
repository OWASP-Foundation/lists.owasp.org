Hi Jim,
I am not an official member, but would like to speak at some point if you are looking for speakers. I have a talk I'd like to submit to some cons later next year and would welcome the opportunity to give it to your group, receive feedback, etc. Please let me know if you have any interest in learning more of my preso and I'll be happy to share it with you.
Thanks,
Dennis

I have some work I have been doing on a PRISM PROOF email scheme that makes
using S/MIME (or PGP) as easy to use as regular mail.

And by that I mean absolutely no additional clicks or configuration unless
you are wanting to force use of encryption and you can exchange your email
address with public key in exactly the same ways as you exchange email
addresses today (e.g. linked in etc.).

Main presentation 7 pm -  - JavaScript Verification: From Browsers to Pages

Modern web browsers implement a "private browsing" mode that is intended to
leave behind no traces of a user's browsing activity on their computer.
This feature is in direct tension with support for *extensions*, which let
users add third-party functionality into their browser. I will discuss the
scope of this problem, present our approach to verifying extensions'
compliance with private browsing mode, and sketch our findings on several
real, third-party extensions. I will then briefly describe the toolkit
underlying our approach, and end with a sketch of a newer project, adapting
this approach to the very different-seeming problem of statically catching
errors when using the jQuery library.

Benjamin Lerner has just completed a post-doctoral research position in the
PLT group at Brown University, and is now a lecturer at Northeastern
University.  His research examines the challenges of analyzing client-side
web programming, from the behavior of web pages down through the semantics
of the browser.  He received a PhD in Computer Science from the University
of Washington in 2011, building a platform to analyze conflicts between
browser extensions, and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from
Yale University.
