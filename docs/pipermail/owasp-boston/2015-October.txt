Subject: [Owasp-boston] VIP pass to SC Congress for OWASP booth duty Nov. 12
Message-ID: <CAKEaLK=JuMhjNgAHTipfZ5FM6VhPDqGkn60WAcxbP31Y+sB9AQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

OWASP has formed a partnership with SC Congress. Included in our agreement
is their upcoming SC Congress event happening November 12, 2015 at the
Metro Meeting Centers in Boston.  http://www.sccongress.com/boston/.  They
are expecting 200+ in attendance.



They have offered us expo space to help promote OWASP and the local Boston
Chapter.  In addition to the expo space they also offered complimentary VIP
passes for people who volunteer to staff the OWASP booth. We need people
there from 10:30 am to set up until 6:30 pm. If you would like to volunteer
for the OWASP booth for any time span, please email boston at owasp.org with
the hours you can be there and phone contact information. OWASP will supply
collateral and booth materials, we just need people to hand it out and talk
about the local chapter. If we get 2 or more people for the same time they
can share the VIP passes and attend the conference. You can also have one
of our blue OWASP Boston Top 10 tshirts, altho we only have XL.



Thanks, Jim

 secure dev/ops and more
Message-ID: <CAKEaLK=CMQzh0LkDGkwLwL1cNXN=4SsrQMN_V6qf689HGjbcTw@mail.gmail.com>

Attendee interaction is always mentioned as a high value at meetings and
was great at the MetroWest meetings, so we're doing that at Akamai this
month. Some discussion starters so far: SSL certificate impacts from
CA/Browser alliance decisions and SHA1 weakness; mutual (client) SSL,
javascript client and server side; what the heck is threat intelligence,
dev ops and faster secure SDLC.

Suggest some more here and bring your questions and comments.

At Akamai Cambridge  150 Broadway  (same old place, just a better address
for map programs than the Cambridge Center address).

Pizza, salad and drinks provided by Akamai.
