<PRE>How to Break Software Security ------ Dr. Herbert H. Thompson, Ph. D. -
Chief Security Strategist 
Security Innovation 
 
Dr. Thompson will cover topics from his book &quot;How to Break Software
Security: Effective Techniques for Security Testing&quot; and how to think like
an attacker. Dr. Thompson greatly enjoys Q+A sessions and is very passionate
about security testing, and writing secure code. He recently met with Bill
Gates for an hour, and Gates peppered him with questions for 30 minutes of
his one hour meeting 

Dr. Thompson's primary responsibilities with Security Innovation include the
overall security &amp; research efforts on all areas of software security. He is
also responsible for training developers and security testers at some of the
world's largest software companies including Microsoft, HP, IBM, Cisco,
Symantec and SAIC. In 2005, Dr. Thompson was chosen a Microsoft Most
Valuable Professional in the field of Development Security. 
Security Innovation is an application security consulting company,
specializing in working with companies and organizations whose applications
absolutely positively have to be secure. Exploitability of applications due
to poor design has reached epidemic levels and perimeter/network defenses
are not enough to protect your business. We help you build, deliver, deploy
and test applications to ensure your enterprise is as secure as it can be 

Pizza will be provided by Security Innovation
