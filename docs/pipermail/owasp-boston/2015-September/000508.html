*InfoSec Communication Workshop*

Rob Cheyne

CEO, Big Brain Security

Executive Director, SOURCE Conference



When presenting, teaching, or leading a discussion on technical topics, a
big part of the secret to success is the ability to clearly explain
technical information, and the impact it has on business risks. For some
this comes more naturally than others, but this is absolutely a learnable
skill.



In the time I&#8217;ve been teaching, I have had to come up with many ways of
explaining information security concepts (both technical and non-technical)
to vastly different audiences in a way that everyone gets it. In some
cases, I&#8217;ve even been tasked with teaching security to hostile audiences,
and had to figure out ways to get them to care.



One of the most important skills you can develop is the ability to explain
something technical in a way that everyone can follow along, while
simultaneously persuading your audience to care what you are talking about
and leave them wanting more.



The formula often boils down to:

            - using specific strategies to keep everyone engaged

            - conveying a story

            - clearly explaining the *necessary* details, and *only* the
necessary details

            - not condescending to the technical folks in the room with
overly simplistic explanations

            - simultaneously not leaving the less technical (or
non-technical) folks in the room behind



This workshop session will provide you with practical tips and tricks for
doing exactly this, and also provide some opportunities for practice.
Practice makes perfect!



Please join Rob in this highly interactive workshop for a deeper dive down
the security communication rabbit hole and experience a new way of
communicating.
