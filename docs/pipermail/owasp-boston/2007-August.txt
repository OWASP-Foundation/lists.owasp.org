Subject: [Owasp-boston] Speaker suggestions for Sept meeting
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4A9E7@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

Hi Folks,
I'm trying to have our chapter participate in the OWASP Day "Privacy in
the 21st century" but haven't come up with any speakers so far. If
anybody has any suggestions please let me know. 

NOTE - the Sept meeting is on Thursday Sept 6, at Microsoft, in a larger
room. I moved the date to accommodate the OWASP request for all chapters
to meet on the same day. 

Thanks, Jim
