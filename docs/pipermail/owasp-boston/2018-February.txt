What's Out and Why.

While the 2017 Top Ten continued the trend toward risks and not
vulnerabilities, there was significant differences of opinion among the
main contributors leading to some changes in the document leadership and
the list itself. We'll cover the various arguments around the list
contents, the data interpretation, list selection methodology, and how you
could realistically use the list.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] March 6 meeting - Containers and Application security
Message-ID: <CAKEaLK=5P=-SY3RX+4yZ7jmj44qyN2-Mj7viu+NM9zZfYU9-2A@mail.gmail.com>

*Main presentation description - *


*Topic:  Containers have moved from Hype to Deployment in the Enterprise.
We will discuss Security?s role in defining policy without inhibiting Dev.*



What is the impact of Containers on the process and practice of Security,
from SDLC controls through administration, network, cloud and Incident
Management? What do you need to demand from DevOps in order to maintain
your security standards and acceptance testing in fast moving deployments?
We will review real world examples, such as Spectre/Meltdown, Equifax,
among others, and determine what the impact/security risk could be if the
apps were containerized.
