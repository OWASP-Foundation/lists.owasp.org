Hi Folks,
The free OWASP Boston Application Security Conference 2012 will take place
Saturday Oct. 13 at Microsoft New England Research Center, same as the
previous two conferences.
We'll need pre-conference and day-of-conference volunteers.
The pre-conference areas we need help with are -
volunteer coordinator - just keep track of who volunteered for what and
receive the emails from volunteers
conference operations coordinator- help me keep things happening on
schedule the day of the conference, handle the unexpected, suggest
improvements
marketing coordinator - OWASP has some publicity pages and mechanisms,
there are lots of web sites to post events, twitter, whatever you can think
of (subject to approval), QR codes

I you want to sign up for any of these positions just send me an email.

Please send me any suggestions you have for conference presentation topics
that you would like to see. We'll also be trying a lightning presentations
slot where 3 people each do a 15 minute presentation. If you want to do a
presentation send me an abstract, we'll have a request for papers site and
email set up soon.

I also want to try recording some podcasts with some of the speakers, so if
anybody has a high quality podcasting setup they can let us use the day of
the conference that would be great.

More info to follow.

Jim
