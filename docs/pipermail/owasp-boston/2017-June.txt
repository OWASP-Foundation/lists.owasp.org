Hi everyone,

We will be having our next OWASP RI meeting on June 20th, 6:30 pm at
Upserve, 10 Dorrance Street in Providence. You can get all the information
and RSVP here:
https://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/events/239828308/


Here are the details:
Modern Security Architecture with OpenID Connect

Modern applications require modern security and the OpenID Connect and
OAuth2 security protocols are designed to meet this need. To achieve a
modern security architecture you must then use something called a ?security
token service? that implements these protocols. In this session we will
look at how applications are now architected to incorporate and use a token
service for authentication thus providing single sign-on. We will also see
how this same token service also provides tokens for securing Web APIs.

Brock Allen's bio:

Currently Brock is an independent consultant specializing in .NET, web
development, and web-based security with 20 years of industry
experience.Brock is the co-author of many security related open source
frameworks including IdentityServer, IdentityManager, and MembershipReboot.
He also frequently posts to the ASP.NET <http://asp.net/> forums, is a MVP
for ASP.NET/IIS <http://asp.net/IIS>, a member of ASPInsiders and a
contributor to the ASP.NET <http://asp.net/> platform.

We hope to see you there!

Patrick Laverty

OWASP RI Chapter Leader
