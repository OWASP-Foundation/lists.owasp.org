Topic - Disclosure Samsara, or &quot;the endless vulnerability disclosure
debate&quot;_

 

Vulnerability disclosure has a purpose. It can help make software and
hardware vendors and service providers accountable for shortcomings in
their offerings; and detailed or full disclosure can give IT and
information security professionals the information they need to validate
the resilience and efficacy of their controls. Generally speaking, a
happy balance is achieved when vulnerabilities are disclosed in a
&quot;responsible&quot; manner. But what is &quot;responsible&quot;?

 

It's been nearly a decade since the introduction of RFPolicy, a document
often considered to be the basis for modern, responsible vulnerability
disclosure, yet there still remains a significant division between the
camps of &quot;full disclosure&quot;, &quot;partial disclosure&quot;, and &quot;zero disclosure&quot;.

The &quot;responsible disclosure&quot; debate seems to be an endless cycle, coming
back fully reconstituted *just* when we think it's been run dry.

Lawsuits, gag orders, and boatloads of drama are some of the negative
things researchers have dealt with when disclosing a bug or flaw to a
vendor or service provider. This type of reaction can be very
discouraging for a security researcher, possibly resulting in them
eschewing communication with the vendor in favor of disclosing it
outright or even selling the details to the highest bidder.

 

With continued, accelerated awareness and discussion, the information
security community can work toward solidifying an approach to disclosure
that, amongst other things:

 

* facilitates interaction between the researcher and vendor or service
provider

* acknowledges the researcher's work

* provides adequate protection for the security researcher

* builds a reasonable timeline and plan for a solution to the bug or
flaw (and keeps parties from stalling)

* builds a reasonable timeline for public disclosure of the bug or flaw
&quot;&quot;&quot;
