<PRE>Hello Everybody,
We had our first meeting last Wed.; 6 people attended. The presentation will
up on the web site soon.
 
O'Reilly books has accepted my application as a technical user group so you
can get 20% discount on O'Reilly, No Starch, Paraglyph, Pragmatic Bookshelf,
SitePoint, and Syngress books and O'Reilly conferences using their web site.
Just use code DSUG. O'Reilly also make free copies of books available to
reviewers. If you would like to review a book, send me the title and ISBN
number and I'll get it for you. Check out the review guidlines and examples
on the O'Reilly site. You can tell us what you thought at a meeting and the
review can go on the O'Reilly site and our site. I'll be reviewing  'Secure
Coding: Principles and Practices' .
 
I got some feedback on topics you are interested in for future meetings, and
that was some topics that would useful to management, not just detailed
technical topics, so I'll work on getting some speakers along those lines.
 
For those of you that didn't make the meeting, if you have any suggestions
for topics or can give me any leads on speakers that would be great. I'll be
contacting those of you that have expressed an interest in speaking.
