Overview:

In this highly interactive two-part workshop, Rob Cheyne of Safelight
Security will show you the basics of conducting a real-world
architecture & design review. 

This workshop draws from Safelight's Security Architecture Fundamentals
training course, a two-day course frequently used to teach Fortune 500
companies how to look at their system architectures from both the
hacker's and the designer's point of view.  

First session:

In the first session on October 6, Rob discusses a practical approach to
architecture review and threat modeling using real-world examples. This
session lays the foundation for participants to participate in a
real-world architecture review in the December session. 

Attendees will learn:

            - How to holistically examine a system architecture for
security issues from both the designer's and the hacker's point of view

            - To identify frequently overlooked areas where security
vulnerabilities commonly occur

            - Tips for assessing a system at the host-level, network
level, and application level

            - Practical ways to apply threat modeling to help manage
risk 

Second session:

In the December 1st session, Rob will conduct a sample architecture
assessment against a real-world system, and in the process, teach
participants how to conduct an architecture of their own.  Brave
volunteers will be welcome to share their own architectures and have
them reviewed. This is an opportunity to get free consulting that
typically costs thousands of dollars.  There is limited time, so not
every one will get chosen.  If you are interested in this, please
contact Rob Cheyne (rcheyne at safelightsecurity.com) directly.

 Who should attend?

Anyone can participate and learn from the discussion in this accessible
and dynamic workshop.  Whether you are an architect, a developer, or a
manager, there will be something here for you.  Come learn to challenge
your assumptions.

Additional information:

Penetration testing is a common way to evaluate an application's
security.  Yet a comprehensive architecture and design assessment can
uncover critical security issues that often cost far less to resolve
early on in a project.  Many companies overlook this element of system
design.

Rob was one of a select few at security consulting company @stake who
regularly led and conducted full-blown enterprise-level architecture
assessments for Fortune 500 companies.  Drawing from his experience with
dozens of real-world architecture assessments over the past 12 years,
and his 20 years as a software developer, architect, and consultant, Rob
teaches students to challenge assumptions that frequently lead to
long-term security and reliability problems.

Main Topic - Open SAMM - Software Assurance Maturity Model

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) project is committed to
building a usable framework to help organizations formulate and
implement a strategy for application security that's tailored to the
specific business risks facing the organization. The goal is to create
well-defined and measurable goals that can be used by small, medium,and
large sized organizations in any line of business that involves software
development. The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) project is

Presenter - Pravir Chandra, OWASP Open SAMM Project Leader, Director of
Strategic Services at Fortify Software

Comments about Open SAMM - 

"From a consultant's perspective, it's impressive to our clients that
OpenSAMM has been approved not only by us but also by a number of our
industry peers," said Matt Bartoldus, a Director at Gotham Digital
Science, an information security consulting firm. "Plus, its versatility
enables us to apply it to our full range of clients, regardless of the
size, type of software or method of development."

 

"I have conducted, sold and project managed SAMM engagements to
financial service (FS) organisations throughout Europe over the past
years. It is obvious the demand is growing for such services. The rise
in demand of  "security at source" be it via code review, secure
development or grey box penetration testing and a supporting framework
to tie it all together and understandably so as SAMM is one of the first
pragmatic benchmarking and assessment frameworks for the somewhat
ancient "Security in the SDLC" challenge.  "

Eoin Keary, runs the Ernst & Young application security team across
Europe.
