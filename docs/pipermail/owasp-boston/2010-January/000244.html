<PRE>Yes, we are having our regular Feb. meeting, even tho it's just 6 days
after the Jan. meeting.

 

<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston</A>

 

Date - Feb. 3

 

Time - 6:30 p.m.

 

Main Topic - New Technology, Same Old Vulnerabilities

Technology often creates new, exciting and more efficient ways of doing
business. The added efficiency and lower costs frequently drives a
strong desire to implement the latest and greatest technology.  The down
side is that we often jump into new technology without fully considering
the security implications, and inadvertently implement the same old
vulnerabilities time and again.

 

Web services are a great example of this.   Web services are a means of
adding a web-based programming interface to nearly any legacy enterprise
application, and they are being implemented across many industries at a
rapid pace. In many cases we have seen that the implementers are not
considering security at all, but merely functionality.  This leads to a
wealth of subtle security vulnerabilities.

 

In this talk, Rob Cheyne of Safelight Security Advisors will explore
some ways that we consistently add risk to our organizations, uncover
some ticking time bombs, and discuss some ways to improve the situation.
He will explore ways that we can better apply security in the
development lifecycle when implementing new technologies.  Along the
way, he will provide examples of classical vulnerabilities that show up
in new technologies.
