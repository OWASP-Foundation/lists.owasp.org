Topic - Synergy! A world where the tools communicate

 

Description - Most penetration testers use many separate tools to get
the job done. The problem is that many of the security tools available
today do not have formats can allow for the tools to easily communicate
directly. This makes automation very difficult. This speech will explain
some of ways to fix the problem. We will be releasing several modules
that allow for pentesters to integrate the data so that we can work
towards automating a large portion of the process so that the pentesters
can focus on the difficult aspects of the assessment that can not be
automated. All pentests need to focus on performing the tasks that no
automated solution can. This will be done integrating the existing tools
we will make a large step in that direction.

 

Speaker - Josh Abraham.

Mr. Abraham joined Rapid7 in 2006 as a Security Consultant. Josh has
extensive IT Security and Auditing experience and worked as an
enterprise risk assessment analyst for Hasbro Corporation. Josh
specializes in penetration testing, web application security
assessments, wireless security assessments, and custom code development.
In the past, he has spoken at BlackHat, DefCon, ShmooCon, Infosec World,
OWASP Boston, LinuxWorld, Comdex and BLUG. In his spare time, he
contributes code to open source security projects such as the BackTrack
LiveCD, BeEF, Nikto, Fierce, and PBNJ.
