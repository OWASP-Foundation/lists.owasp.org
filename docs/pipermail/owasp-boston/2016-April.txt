Subject: [Owasp-boston] Training Class Sponsorship request
Message-ID: <CAKEaLK=LUGjJOGWaXM6-xYj2reeO5sy7kKPqhfFxpgyYviuZ0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,
We are planning to provide 2 days of web application penetration testing
Monday and Tuesday July 18th, 19th from 8:00AM ET to 5PM ET, in Waltham MA
for a very low price by well known pentest trainer Tim Tomes. We're looking
for sponsors to help us lower the price even more and help defray the cost.
Sponsorship includes some free employee admission, logo placement on the
event and chapter web pages, logo placement and short presentation at the
training venue. For the complete sponsorship document please email
boston at owasp.org.

The course title is Practical Web Application Penetration Testing.
This course provides customized training on the latest open source tools
and manual techniques for performing end-to-end web application penetration
testing engagements. A major goal of this course is teaching students the
glue that brings the tools and techniques together to successfully perform
a web application penetration test from beginning to end, an oversight in
most web application penetration testing courses.
The majority of the course will be spent performing an instructor led,
hands-on web application penetration test.  This experience will help
students gain the confidence and knowledge necessary to perform web
application penetration tests as an application security professional.

The instructor is Tim Tomes, who is the Director of Application security at
nVisium, and has taught for SANS and Blackhat.

Thanks, Jim

Hi Everyone:

I'm just sending this out as an FYI on OWASP's discount on the upcoming
Source Conference Boston 2016 and training.


Regards,
Roy


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Big Brain Security is excited to be hosting SOURCE Boston 2016 on May
18-19th, and pre-conference trainings on May 16-17th at the Courtyard
Marriott Downtown Boston!



The SOURCE Conference, Boston?s premier Information Security conference,
specializes in bringing business, technology and security professionals
together to discuss practical solutions to real-world problems. Established
in 2008, the SOURCE Conference provides a unique environment for learning,
networking, and exchanging ideas and solutions for today?s information
security challenges.



*Benefits of SOURCE Boston 2016:*

- 3 Tracks

*- Over 30 speakers!*

- Outstanding personal and professional development opportunities

*- 2 days of pre-conference training opportunities - great opportunity to
complete some CPEs for the year*

- Networking opportunities with some of Boston?s best and brightest
InfoSec, business, and technology professionals

- Intimate conference environment where you can engage directly with the
speakers and attendees

*- Interactive sessions and workshops *



*SOURCE is not just another place to come see talks!*

Although we do have some fantastic talks lined up for you, we specialize in
being a highly interactive environment. *Many of our attendees say this is
one of their favorite conferences of the year, and they come back year
after year.  *



*This year?s keynotes include:*

*Richard Thieme, ThiemeWorks Presents* - "Play Through the Pain? - The
Impact of Forbidden Knowledge on Security and Intelligence Professionals?.

*Richard is legendary in the infosec community, and has decades of
experiences as a presenter, author, and practitioner. This talk alone is
worth the price of admission.*



*Chris Nickerson, CEO, Lares Consulting *- "The Nightmare of a Pentester" -

Chris is a professional penetration tester who will be discussing the
tricks that his clients' blue teams use to keep him out of their networks.
He delivered this talk at SOURCE Seattle this year and it was outstanding.



*Deidre Diamond, Founder, Cyber Security Network *- "10 Words to Stop Using
Now?

The better we choose our words, the more we hone our thinking,. If we can
think and speak with precision, we often avoid things like stress,
depression and conflict. Deidre will share with us 10 words to stop using
right now that can cultivate your thinking with more creative and
expressive word choice.



As usual, we also have an outstanding selection of speakers lined up. The
main conference is being held on May 18-19th, and our complete list of
speakers and topics can be found at:
http://www.sourceconference.com/#!boston-2016-agenda/cr0g. Trainings will
be held on May 16th-17th.

In addition to the usual agenda, we have some excellent pre-conference
training offerings lined up for you. These are trainings that are rarely
held in the Boston area, so please take advantage of this opportunity while
its available.  We?ve set the prices low this year, and your professional
discounts make them even lower, so these should be a no-brainer at this
price. This is likely to be the lowest price you?ll ever pay for these
courses.



This year?s selection of trainings include:



*5/16/2016  -  InfoSec Train the Trainer    $495 (YOUR PRICE: $395)*

  $995 (YOUR PRICE: $795)*



*A few notes on the trainings:*

- The InfoSec Train the Trainer course will be taught by Rob Cheyne. It is
an extended version of the OWASP BASC Workshop he did last year that
was *STANDING
ROOM ONLY! *Not to be missed!

- The Application Security Risk for Executives and Managers course is the
course that *every manager and executive should attend. *

- And if Application Security is your thing, Jon Gorenflo, our guest
instructor, will host a* 2-day deep dive on using Python to get the most
out of Burp Suite*.

- ALL trainings include a free ticket to the SOURCE Conference, which if
you do the math, means you?re getting these courses at unheard of prices.

Rob wants to extend his offer to OWASP Boston.  -----


Hey everyone,



I apologize for how late this is going out - the end of 2015 was pretty
intense, and I?ve had an absolute crazy 2016. But everything?s coming
together, and this will hopefully reach those who can benefit from it.



In just a few weeks (May 18th-19th), we?re running the SOURCE Conference in
Boston again. It?s absolutely going to be one of the best shows we?ve ever
done. If you are event remotely interested in InfoSec, you must attend this
event. Find a way to clear off your schedule, and find a way to get there.
I promise you will thank me later. The opening keynote alone is worth the
price of admission. btw, last chance for early bird tickets - ticket prices
are $349 today, and go up to $495 on May 1st. www.sourceconference.com



*Also, and more important, on May 16th I?m hosting an InfoSec Train the
Trainer class at the Courtyard Marriott Downtown. *



If you attended my BASC session and got something valuable out of it, you
owe it to yourself to attend this class.



*The things I?m teaching at the InfoSec Train the Trainer will:*

*- Help you to be a better communicator*

*- Help you in your career*

*- Help you better enroll people in your projects to get the things you
need to make them happen*

*- Maybe even get you a higher paying job at some point (public speaking is
one of the highest paying jobs out there).*



This will be an impactful, highly interactive one-day session. This stuff
is no joke, and I teach the things I know for sure work. If you attended
one of my breakout sessions, you know I can deliver on what I?m offering
here. If you miss this session, you will either have to wait another year
or get on a plane to attend one someplace else.



As I probably mentioned during the OWASP session, I?ve spent tens of
thousands of dollars of my own money learning how to do what I do. And
after over a decade of actually doing it, I?ve distilled it down into the
kinds of sessions you saw me teach at BASC. Sharing this is something I do
because I love it.



*Ok, down to brass tacks. Let?s talk about price.*



*- A SOURCE Boston ticket is $495 in advance, and $595 at the door. You
have one day left to get the early bird deal of $349. Seriously, just do
it, or you?ll kick yourself when you find out what you missed.*



- Training ticket prices are also $495, *and here?s a little secret - they
include a SOURCE Boston ticket! I*?ve set the prices super-low to kick this
off - tickets will probably never be this cheap again.



If you attend one of my trainings, use the discount code OWASP2016_TTT to
receive an additional $100 off the ticket.



*So for $395, you get to attend the Infosec Train the Trainer event, AND
you get to attend the conference itself. That is literally the best deal in
InfoSec right now, and if you have the ability to do it, you owe it to
yourself to make it happen. *



This is not hyperbole. This is not a hard sell. This is just me offering
you as much value as I know how, and I hope you will join me the week of
May 16th.



Oh, one extra thing - I still have a limited number of free BSides Boston
tickets to give out when you register now. BSides Boston is happening on
Saturday, May 21st, and we?re proud to be helping to support their event.



Thanks, and hope to see you all there. If you can?t make it, please feel
free to forward to someone who can. Next year, I promise you?ll get more
notice, but I can?t promise it will be this cheap. =)



Hope to see you all soon.



Cheers,

  ?rob
