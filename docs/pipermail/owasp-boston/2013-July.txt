Topic: *RailsGoat*

Presented by: *Ken Johnson*

Abstract: While working to secure rails applications in a truly Agile
development environment, it became clear that the Rails and Ruby ecosystem
needed attention from the security community in the form of free and open
training, and the events that have transpired within the last few months
have only reinforced that belief. RailsGoat
<http://railsgoat.cktricky.com/>is an attempt to bring attention to
both the problems that most frequently
occur in Rails as well as the solutions for remediation. To accomplish
this, we've built a vulnerable Rails application that aligns with the OWASP
Top 10 and can be used as a training tool for Rails-based development shops.

Topic: *PhoneGap on Android*

Presented by: *Jack Mannino*

Abstract: PhoneGap is a widely used framework that allows developers to
rapidly build cross-platform mobile applications using HTML5, JavaScript,
and CSS. Using PhoneGap plugins, developers can call native platform APIs
from browser-like applications using JavaScript. This approach introduces
vulnerabilities that are not typically as prevalent within native Android
applications, warranting a fresh look at the way we view mobile
applications. In this presentation, we will take a deep look at the Android
implementation of the framework and we will examine the overall attack
surface for applications. Real-world examples of vulnerable applications
will be demonstrated as well in order to provide context, entertainment,
and enjoyment.
