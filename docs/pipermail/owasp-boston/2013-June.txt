Topic: *RailsGoat*

Presented by: *Ken Johnson*

Abstract: While working to secure rails applications in a truly Agile
development environment, it became clear that the Rails and Ruby ecosystem
needed attention from the security community in the form of free and open
training, and the events that have transpired within the last few months
have only reinforced that belief. RailsGoat
<http://railsgoat.cktricky.com/>is an attempt to bring attention to
both the problems that most frequently
occur in Rails as well as the solutions for remediation. To accomplish
this, we've built a vulnerable Rails application that aligns with the OWASP
Top 10 and can be used as a training tool for Rails-based development shops.

Topic: *Mobile Vulnerabilities*

Presented by: *Jack Mannino*

Abstract: Details to be posted soon
