Hi Folks,
In order to put on BASC 2016, more low-cost high-value training and
activities such as defend the flag and local university student chapters,
we need sponsorship dollars. If you have any contacts at any companies you
think might be willing to be a chapter sponsor, especially the ones
mentioned below, could you send us the contact information and we'll reach
out to them with a document that fully describes the benefits of
sponsorship and how to contribute.

Thanks, Jim
