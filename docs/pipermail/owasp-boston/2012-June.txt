6:45 Jim Weiler - News and Views you can Use and Abuse - app sec news
stories and opinion exchange

7:15 - Will Vandevanter

Will Vandevanter is a senior penetration tester and researcher at
Rapid7. His focus interests include web application security and secure
code. He has previously spoken at Defcon, SOURCE, BSides LV, and other
conferences. 

 

This turbo talk will introduce a new Metasploit module that fingerprints
"known" web applications, attempts the default credentials for the
application, and runs an associated exploit or authenticated access
module if applicable. Some example fingerprints in the database target
common enterprise web applications including Microsoft products (Outlook
Web Access, Sharepoint), printers (Xerox Document Centre), security
cameras, routers, and others. 

 

Will will also talk a little about how to use Metasploit.
