Subject: [Owasp-boston] Jan. 25 Meeting - OWASP Top 10 2017 - What's In,
	What's Out and Why
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKmmm4ENUS14yY24Mm0K4Uv_DuGUM3LPSmHJPosE293BZQ@mail.gmail.com>

While the 2017 Top Ten continued the trend toward risks and not
vulnerabilities, there was significant differences of opinion among the
main contributors leading to some changes in the document leadership and
the list itself. We'll cover the various arguments around the list
contents, the data interpretation, list selection methodology, and how you
could realistically use the list.

You need to say you're going on the OWASP Boston Meetup site
https://www.meetup.com/owaspboston/ because we need to give a list of
attendees to the host.

Pizza and soda will be provided by LogMeIn.

where - LogMeIn  320 Summer St. Boston.
when - 6:30 - 7 - talking, infosec news, announcements
7 - 8 main presentation - Jim Weiler, OWASP Boston Chapter Leader, Director
of Application Security Marriott International

Subject: [Owasp-boston] IEEE Secure Development Conference 2018 seeking
	industry presentations
Message-ID: <CACbB59cg2iknO_JpH=jHavOssL8PphsFvEPnbUX_m940PDwdQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

The IEEE Secure Development Conference will be held in Boston on Sept.
30-October 2, 2018. The program committee is actively seeking to increase
industry participation. They've made it very easy for practitioners to
present "practitioner sessions" along the lines of what we usually have at
OWASP meetings. In fact, if you wanted to simply update an OWASP
presentation, I think the program committee would take it seriously.

The submission deadline is March 5, 2018. Here's what the conference is
asking for:


   - Practitioners session abstracts, up to one page. The abstracts will be
   lightly reviewed. We strongly encourage practitioners from the industry and
   government to submit, to share their security experiences and insights,
   challenges and obstacles encountered. Authors of accepted abstracts will be
   invited to give a short talk during the practitioners sessions at the
   conference. The abstracts will be included in the conference?s IEEE
   proceedings.


The complete call for papers is at https://secdev.ieee.org/2018/papers/

Thanks,

Andrew Gronosky
IEEE SecDev 2018 Registration Chair
