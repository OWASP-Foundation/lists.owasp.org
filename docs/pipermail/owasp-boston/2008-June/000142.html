<PRE>Next Meeting Thursday June 26 - 6:30 pm
&#160;
Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd., Sixth Floor Waltham, MA
&#160;
Main Speaker - Jeremiah Grossman; Founder and CTO, Whitehat Security
&#160;
Appetizer - Hacking Intranets from the Outside (Just when you thought your network was safe)
Port scanning with Javascript

Main Topic - Business Logic Flaws: How they put your Websites at Risk 
Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are&#160; just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that&#160; malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. These&#160; types of vulnerabilities are routinely overlooked during QA because&#160; the process is intended to test what a piece of code is supposed to&#160; 
do and not what it can be made to do. The other problem(s) with&#160; business logic flaws is scanners can't identify them, IDS can't&#160; detect them, and Web application firewalls can't defend them. Plus,&#160; the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more&#160; prone it is to have flaws in business logic.The presentation will&#160; provide real-world examples of how pernicious and dangerous business&#160; logic flaws are to the security of a website. We'll also show how&#160; best to spot them and provide organizations with a simple and&#160; rational game plan to prevent them.
Speaker Bio - 

Mr. Grossman founded WhiteHat Security in 2001. Prior to WhiteHat, Mr. Grossman was an information security officer at Yahoo! responsible for performing security reviews on the company's hundreds of web applications. As one of the world's busiest web properties, with over 17,000 web servers for customer access and 600 web applications, the highest level of security was required. Mr. Grossman is a founder of the Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Jeremiah speaks at Blackhat, Defcon, RSA and OWASP chapters. Jeremiah has a great depth of knowledge, experience and anecdotes, and is a very friendly, interactive guy. 
&#160;
Directions - 
&gt;<i>From Rt. 128 North take exit 26 toward Waltham, East up the hill on Rt. 20. From Rt 128 South take exit 26 but go around the rotary to get to 20 East to Waltham. Follow signs for Rt. 117 (left at the second light). When you get to 117 turn left (West). You will cross back over Rt. 128. Jones Rd. (look for the Waltham Weston Corporate Center sign) is the second left, at a blinking yellow light, on Rt. 117 going west about 0.1 miles from Rt. 128 (I95). The office building is at the bottom of Jones Rd. Best parking is to turn right just before the building and park in the back. Knock on the door to get the security guard to open it. The room is MPR C on the 6th floor.
