Adriel Desautels -  Differences between Web Application Penetration
Testing and Vulnerability Scanning

 

Adriel T. Desautels is the President and CTO of Netragard, LLC. Among
other things Adriel specializes in the delivery of advanced, high-threat
anti-hacking services and covert network penetration methodologies.
Prior to founding Netragard Adriel founded the internationally
recognized SNOsoft Research Team, which quickly became the think tank
for Secure Network Operations, Inc. Today SNOsoft is owned and operated
by Netragard LLC. 

Adriel also has extensive experience and expertise in the design and
deployment of sophisticated Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention
(IDS/IPS) systems. In early 2002 Adriel designed an IDS/IPS technology
with powerful event correlation capabilities capable of accurately
identifying real events buried in a high volume of noise. That
technology was later acquired by a private third party. As a result of
his expertise Adriel has acted as an expert witness in U.S. Federal
Court.

Today Adriel's responsibilities at Netragard include but are not limited
to the design and management of all of Netragard's professional
services. Adriel's secondary responsibility is to run and maintain
Netragard's Exploit Acquisition Program (EAP). EAP is designed to
acquire bleeding edge, high value research and intelligence from the
hacking community

OWASP O2 Platform
Dinis Cruz

The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge
and workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough source
code-driven application security reviews (blackbox + whitebox). In
addition to the manual findings created/discovered by security
consultants, the OWASP O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of
results from multiple OWASP projects and commercial scanning tools. This
allows security consultants to find, exploit and automate (via Unit
Tests) security vulnerabilities usually dismissed by the community as
impossible to find/recreate. More importantly, it provides security
consultants a mechanism to: (a) &quot;talk&quot; with developers (via UnitTest),
(b) give developers a way to replicate + &quot;check if it's fixed&quot; the
vulnerabilities reported and (c) engage in a two-way conversion on the
best way to fix/remediate those vulnerabilities. For more details
