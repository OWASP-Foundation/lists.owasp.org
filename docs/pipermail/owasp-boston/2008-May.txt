Hi Folks,

Close but no cigar, I was unable to get a speaker for the May meeting. I
did, however, work out with the Microsoft meeting coordinator, a way we
can have remote presenters. If the presenter can set up an 800 #, we can
call the 800 # from the room on the polycom conference phone and hear
and talk with them while someone in the room shows any presentation they
may have.

 

I'm also looking for help in running the group, I'll send more email
about that later. If you have any interest please let me know.

 

Thanks,

 

Jim

Whitehat Security told me they screwed up Jeremiah's calendar and that
he will be in Boston on June 26, so that's the new meeting date. I'll
send out another notice when we get the specific topic and description
but Jeremiah is always interesting and entertaining. We'll still meet at
the usual Microsoft location, different room - MPR A.  For directions
