Lightning Talk - Rob Cheyne, CEO Safelight Security Advisors

In this installment of the Safelight lightning talks series, Rob will
present the basics of a Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.  This
is a common vulnerability, yet frequently misunderstood and often
overlooked. 

 

Rob will demonstrate how CSRF works, how it can be used as part of a
real-world attack, and then discuss ways to prevent the issue from
occurring in your own applications. 

 

Speaker Bio - 

As CEO, Rob sets the vision for the company and manages the executive
team and runs the Instructor-led training practice. Rob has cultivated a
broad range of skills and experience during his 17 years in the
information technology field. He has significant expertise in business
process and e-Commerce systems, systems integration, software
development and information security. He has developed and taught
information security training classes to thousands of students at some
of the largest corporations in the world. Rob has worked in the
information security industry since 1998, beginning with Internet
Security Advantages (ISA). During his time at ISA, Rob led a team that
deployed a full-scale Public Key Infrastructure at a leading state
health care organization. After ISA, Rob was one of the founding
employees of @stake, a pioneer in information security consulting.
During his tenure at @stake, Rob wore many hats and embraced a wide set
of skills and responsibilities. He helped develop application security
assessment methodologies that are still in use today and led @stake's
Application Security Center of Excellence for two years. He led secure
architecture and design reviews, secure code reviews, application
penetration tests and a range of specialized security audits for Fortune
500 companies. Rob is the author of LC4, a version of the award-winning
L0phtCrack password auditing software and he worked on @stake's
SmartRisk Analyzer team, which was eventually spun off as a company
called Veracode. @stake was acquired by Symantec Corporation in October

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston main topic for tonight
Message-ID: <B9D5C5F0F4D84F4E98635ED04D11FC75010DBF8F@stcexcpmb06.corp.star>

This just in from Joey Peloquin, our main presenter tonight - it fits in
perfectly with Rob Cheyne's Lightning Talk topic on CSRF

The title of the preso is, Drive-by Pharming with MonkeyFist.  I'll
start with a description of CSRF, then head into a brief discussion of
attack vectors (ie user-generated content, poorly secured broadband
routers, etc.), and then a description of Drive-by Pharming.  Once
that's done, I'll show the group how I've implemented the attack against
a vulnerable Netgear router.  I'm bringing the router with me - this
will be a "live" demo
