<PRE>Hi Folks,

As we keep working toward making our free 1 day Boston Application
Security Conference 2010 a reality (Saturday, Nov. 20; Microsoft NERD),
we need some help. Below are some tasks that need to be worked on before
and during the conference. Since the conference is free I can't offer
you a free pass for helping, just some self satisfaction for helping
make it happen, maybe some non security skills and experience for your
resume, and maybe some free OWASP merchandise. The general tasks are
listed below, call me to find out more if you're at all interested.

 

Pre - conference

EE_COnference_-__Saturday_November_20_Microsoft_New_England_Research_and
_Development_.28NERD.29.2C_Cambridge_MA.

 

Caterer Liason - choose the caterer (there is a short list who have
worked with MS NERD events before), plan the menu, make sure they
deliver the food. All $ goes thru OWASP, no need to handle $.

 

Publicity - do you know any Computer Science professors to send them a
conference description; we want to attract computer science students
that don't know about application security. Any other publicity ideas -
write a press release for security sites and mags.

 

 

 

Conference Day help

            General - Make sure sponsor booths have what they need, make
sure speakers are present and know which room they are in (there are
only 2), help caterer set up if needed

            Signage - put up room signs, banners, 

            Check in - check people off the registration list, give out
name tags and program, anything else we give out
