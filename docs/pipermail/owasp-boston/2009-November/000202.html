<PRE>Hi Folks,

After attending pen test training at OWASP AppSec 2009 last week, I
realized there are even more tools out there than I was aware of.  So
just to be clear, even though my topic description had the phrase
'what's out there', tomorrow I'm only going to talk about  web
application vulnerability scannering based on the 3 main commercial
tools I've been looking at and have talked to people about, Cenzic
Hailstorm; IBM AppScan and HP WebInspect. The discussion points will
apply to various other commercial and free tools, but there's not enough
time to cover them all. I'll do another presentation on the rest, maybe
in Jan.  

 

Also, remember the Mush Hakhinian will be presenting his experience with
the free source code quality scanning tool Sonar at tomorrow's meeting.
His company is also buying the pizza.
