<PRE>Patrick,

In terms of your first question, I can answer from our experience doing assessments that mix manual and tools for both static and dynamic analysis that those percentages are roughly right.  I don't have quantitative numbers to back up that claim since our analysis isn't based solely on raw numbers.

In terms of employing multiple scanners, we use both AppScan and HP (SPI) and I don't see enough difference in coverage to run both.  I think that using different tools that are looking for different types of problems or using a mix of static and dynamic tools provides enough of a win to justify the extra cost (both dollar and human).

Using this mix of static and dynamic as well as manual and tool-based techniques is exactly what we do.  In the end, however, I find the vulnerabilities that have the highest business-related impact are those that we find manually.  I think it's because many of the defects that the tools miss involve information disclosure and the tools don't have enough intelligence to distinguish what data one is should or should not see.

And they&#8217;re both about the same statement.

Jim stated that the scanners will &#8220;Only going to find 10 &#8211; 20% of vulns &#8211; low hanging fruit&#8221;

My two questions are:

1.      How do we know that they will only find that number?  If we know they&#8217;re missing 80-90%, how did we find them to count those that were missing?

2.      I&#8217;ve read that the most effective and thorough scanning is to get 4-5 different scanners and use them all, as they will find some different vulnerabilities.  Has anyone done this?  What did you find when you look at all the data from multiple scanners and how varied are they at finding different true positive results?

Thank you!

Patrick
