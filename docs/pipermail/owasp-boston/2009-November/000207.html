<PRE>I had the same question when I first heard these kinds of numbers, and
it's true that you can't know the exact number of vulnerabilities that
are really there, so you can't know what % of them any tool is finding.
I got the 10 - 20 % number from other forums, presentations, and talking
to people, and from all those sources it is still a guess based on the
amount of additional vulnerabilities people have found using other types
of tools and procedures, like source code scanning and penetration
testing. Also, the number of vulnerabilities found by a scanner will
vary depending on how much customization is done with the scanner
(recorded manual navigations, values to try for form fields etc). The 10
- 20% is assuming some basic customization.

 

I just read Chris Engs email - and as he said, those numbers are for the
number of vulnerabilities not the number of types of vulnerabilities.
Also as he said, you can run a scan and if it tries 100 variants for the
same vulnerable element (form field or url parameter etc) it might
report that as 100 vulnerabilities, even though it is a change in 1
piece of code that might fix it. You might run the same scan again but
configure it to limit the number of attack variants to 3, in which case
the number of vulnerabilities found would be 3.  Those two settings
would then have a big impact on the % found with scanning vrs something
else or vrs the assumed actual total vulnerabilities.

 

I think there are 2 points to get from those numbers, regardles of
whether the number is really 20% or 50% - 

1. they are the easiest vulnerabilities to exploit 

2. There are lots of other vulnerabilities that can only be found by
other means, mainly pen testing.

And they're both about the same statement.

 

Jim stated that the scanners will &quot;Only going to find 10 - 20% of vulns
- low hanging fruit&quot;

 

My two questions are:

1.      How do we know that they will only find that number?  If we know
they're missing 80-90%, how did we find them to count those that were
missing?

2.      I've read that the most effective and thorough scanning is to
get 4-5 different scanners and use them all, as they will find some
different vulnerabilities.  Has anyone done this?  What did you find
when you look at all the data from multiple scanners and how varied are
they at finding different true positive results?

 

Thank you!

 

Patrick
