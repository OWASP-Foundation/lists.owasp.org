<PRE>The statistic is a bit odd, to be sure, but I think the intent was to convey
that 10-20% of TYPES of vulnerabilities can be found, and that automated
scanners are not a complete solution. Remember, 70% of statistics are
completely made up. ;)

Using multiple scanners can be useful since the weaknesses of one can be
complemented by the strengths of the others, but imagine that you have an
oddly named database backup file (complete with plaintext admin passwords)
sitting in a web-accessible, indexable directory. An automated scanner will
likely never find this, but with a good web spider and a keen eye, a pen
tester certainly will, and this is DEFINITELY a vulnerability.

I suggest using an intercepting proxy like OWASP's WebScarab or Burp Suite
or Paros when doing manual web app pen testing to complement your automated
scans.

Jim stated that the scanners will &#8220;Only going to find 10 &#8211; 20% of vulns &#8211;
low hanging fruit&#8221;



My two questions are:

1.      How do we know that they will only find that number?  If we know
they&#8217;re missing 80-90%, how did we find them to count those that were
missing?

2.      I&#8217;ve read that the most effective and thorough scanning is to get
4-5 different scanners and use them all, as they will find some different
vulnerabilities.  Has anyone done this?  What did you find when you look at
all the data from multiple scanners and how varied are they at finding
different true positive results?



Thank you!



Patrick
