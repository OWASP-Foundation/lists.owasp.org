<PRE>I think you're right for the basic summary or 'executive' stats of the 3
commercial scanners I was talking about - different variants for the
same vulnerable parameter do not add to the vulnerability count. 

AppScan standard (can't remember if the others do too - anybody know?)
lets you control the number of variants (attacks strings per parameter)
that are included in reports, and I had an automated analysis of the
reports set up, so if I didn't set the # of variants to 1, I'd get an
inflated count. That's what I was thinking of. 

Chris, what do you say to customers when they ask things like (I'm
assuming some of them ask this) 'what % of the vulnerabilities will your
(or some other) application vulnerability scanner find?'.

&gt;<i> I just read Chris Engs email - and as he said, those numbers are for
</I>the
&gt;<i> number of vulnerabilities not the number of types of vulnerabilities.
</I>Also as
&gt;<i> he said, you can run a scan and if it tries 100 variants for the same
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerable element (form field or url parameter etc) it might report
</I>that as
&gt;<i> 100 vulnerabilities, even though it is a change in 1 piece of code
</I>that might
&gt;<i> fix it. You might run the same scan again but configure it to limit
</I>the
&gt;<i> number of attack variants to 3, in which case the number of
</I>vulnerabilities
&gt;<i> found would be 3.  Those two settings would then have a big impact on
</I>the %
&gt;<i> found with scanning vrs something else or vrs the assumed actual total
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities.
</I>
Generally if there are multiple attack strings on a single parameter,
it's reported as one vulnerability.  However, if there are multiple
vulnerable parameters on a single URL (e.g. &quot;?foo=ATTACK&quot; and
&quot;?bar=ATTACK&quot;), then those would be reported separately.  At least
that's how we do it.  Are there scanners out there that count each
variation on the attack string as a separate vulnerability? That would
be pretty bogus for sure.
