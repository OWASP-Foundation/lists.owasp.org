<PRE>10% may be enough, it all depends on what you are trying to do with the scanner.

First off, what types of vulnerability can you expect a scanner to
detect? By definition, a scanner is only going to detect known
vulnerabilities since if the scanner can detect the problem it becomes
a known problem. So the question is what percentage of known issues do
the scanners detect? What percentage of vulnerabilities are part of
their corpus?

I am much more interested to know how the scanner is being used, is it
being used as the primary defense against vulnerabilities or is it
being used to measure the effectiveness of procedural controls?

For example, lets imagine that Alice and Bob are using a scanner.
Alice slaps her Web site together using tools she found on the net
written by a group of Russian programmers out in St Petersburg. She
runs the scanner over the site until she has identified and closed all
the vulnerabilities.

Bob starts off by choosing Web site tools that have a reputation for
being solid. He writes a coding standards guide and institutes a code
review process so that no code written by his team goes onto the site
without being seen by at least two pairs of eyes. He makes sure that
all his systems are patched before he runs the scanner. He then
reviews each item identified by the scanner and considers why the
procedural controls failed. He then multiplies the number of
vulnerabilities discovered by ten to provide an estimate of the number
of residual vulnerabilities.


Clearly Bob is performing a lot more work up front, but can expect to
be rewarded by a site that requires a lot less effort to maintain,
besides being a lot more secure.

About ten years ago, I developed a security assessment methodology
called ART (Assets, Risks, Threats) which I have used to analyze the
security of protocols such as SAML during design but most people
considered an infeasible amount of effort to go to in order to secure
an instance of a system. I have spent some time today looking through
the NIST FISMA guidelines and, well they have a six stage process
instead of three and their manual is going to be about the size of the
health care bill before they are finished.

Scanners are useful, but what we should be using them for is to
demonstrate that certain approaches to Web site development have more
hidden costs than others.
