<PRE>Just checking if anyone else is seeing a string of  phishing attacks
hitting the email waves. 

 

I just was privy to a targeted spear phishing attack this morning, with
account information trying to be harvested from Bank of America Account
holders, and the second was a fast-flux domain phishing attack, with the
following verbage, which takes you to a site that wants you to download
an obvious trojan horse exe file which they say is a self extracting pdf
file. 

 

Maybe some interesting things a-foot as the holidays are coming up it
seems. Like to see if anyone else is also seeing these type of things
roaming around,. 

 

Dear bank account holder,

The ACH transaction, recently initiated from your bank account (by you
or any other person), was rejected by the Electronic Payments
Association. Please review the transaction report by clicking the link
