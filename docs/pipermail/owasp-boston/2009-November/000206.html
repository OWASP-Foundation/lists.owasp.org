<PRE>I'll preface by saying that I wasn't at Jim's presentation. That said, I doubt that the intent was to say that only 10-20% of the TYPES of vulnerabilities can be found by automated scanners.  They are typically capable of finding much more than that, unless you are defining very narrow categories for different manifestations of business logic flaws.

Most scanners do look for backup files.  It won't understand the significance of what it found, but chances are it'll find the file.

The other point many people seem to miss when claiming that automated scanners only find 10-20% of vulnerabilities is that their methodology for making such claims is flawed.  They take manual penetration test results, then run a web scanner, and ask &quot;how many of the manual results did the scanner find?&quot; They don't always ask &quot;how many of the automated results did the human find?&quot;  Usually a human won't take the time (nor should they) to find 100 examples of XSS.  They'll find a few representative URLs, add them to the report, and move on.  Time is limited and you don't want to waste it on basic issues that a scanner can find, you want to find the bombshells that require a brain to discover.  The problem is, most of the time, when you give a dev 3 XSS flaws, they'll fix those 3 and say they're done, so it's important to give as many examples as possible.

The bottom line is that these manual vs. automated comparisons are kind of silly in the first place.  Automation gets you a lot, relative to its price.  Manual testing had better find a lot more stuff because it's significantly more expensive.  Use automation across the board, and augment with manual testing for critical assets.  Hit the most critical assets from every possible angle.

The statistic is a bit odd, to be sure, but I think the intent was to convey that 10-20% of TYPES of vulnerabilities can be found, and that automated scanners are not a complete solution. Remember, 70% of statistics are completely made up. ;)

Using multiple scanners can be useful since the weaknesses of one can be complemented by the strengths of the others, but imagine that you have an oddly named database backup file (complete with plaintext admin passwords) sitting in a web-accessible, indexable directory. An automated scanner will likely never find this, but with a good web spider and a keen eye, a pen tester certainly will, and this is DEFINITELY a vulnerability.

I suggest using an intercepting proxy like OWASP's WebScarab or Burp Suite or Paros when doing manual web app pen testing to complement your automated scans.

And they're both about the same statement.

Jim stated that the scanners will &quot;Only going to find 10 - 20% of vulns - low hanging fruit&quot;

My two questions are:

1.      How do we know that they will only find that number?  If we know they're missing 80-90%, how did we find them to count those that were missing?

2.      I've read that the most effective and thorough scanning is to get 4-5 different scanners and use them all, as they will find some different vulnerabilities.  Has anyone done this?  What did you find when you look at all the data from multiple scanners and how varied are they at finding different true positive results?

Thank you!

Patrick
