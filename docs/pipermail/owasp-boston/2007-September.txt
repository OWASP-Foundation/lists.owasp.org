Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - no Sept meeting
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4AA49@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

I'm very sorry folks, I couldn't get any speakers for the changed date
and the required topic for September, OWASP privacy day.  I was on
vacation for 2 weeks, looking for a new job, judging 140 papers for the
'Developing with Security' track of the RSA 2008 conference and just
couldn't get any of the four leads I tried. 

However, there are lots of speakers volunteering to speak on other web
app security topics, so I feel pretty good about the last 3 meetings
this year. 

Stay tuned, and please send me any suggestions you have about the group.
Is anybody working with or interested in WebScarab?  We could have
sessions on that tool or any other before the main presentation. 

Thanks and sorry,
Jim

Subject: [Owasp-boston] Sept. 6 meeting is ON - privacy discussion with
	ourselves
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4AA4D@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

One of our members suggested that we can have a useful discussion
without a main presentation and that's a great idea. So the meeting is
on, no pizza sponsor but let's see what we have to say about "What is
the current state of Privacy on Web Application Security? and what
should we be focusing on?. We can still contribute to the global event. 
I can moderate the discussion, and supply a few ideas and privacy
vulnerabilities from my work experience. I'll be driving back from White
Plains but I'll be there.
We're in a meeting room down the hall from the usual - it's a bigger
room. See you tomorrow (Thursday).
