Message-ID: <CAAniQj1Bn8KZdwUef2J7U-EohAYpQdajiYfT5J_HHXK9xcw+NA@mail.gmail.com>

please get in contact with us!


Tentative Dates:
Monday 6/12 - Wednesday 6/14
or
Monday 6/26 - Wednesday 6/28

The classes typically run the length of a full day 8am-5pm ET.


Description
This three-day course is designed to improve a person?s skills with manual
testing web applications and monitoring the resulting logs.

This is focused on providing both testing and detection skills for
attendees. It is structured as a hands-on proficiency course, such that IT
professionals of all skill levels should benefit.

The course leverages the Samurai WTF environment as a test lab, and
primarily focuses on the skillful use of interception proxies (Burp or ZAP)
to efficiently perform tests. It also helps build detection and monitoring
techniques to discover attacks against your web applications and
infrastructure. The course then culminates with a live-fire capture the
flag that focuses on both testing the target application as well as
reviewing real-world application logs for attacks.
