7:00    Cenzic will present 

"Cloudy with a Chance of Hack"

 

Cloud computing is a cost effective and efficient way for enterprises to
automate their processes. However organizations need to be aware of the
pitfalls of the many cloud solutions out there - one of the main being
security. Most cloud applications were built for ease of use and without
security necessarily in mind. Companies need to be asking their solution
providers about the security measures used in developing the application
and get an independent verification to make sure there are no gaping
holes. With over 75% of attacks occurring through the Web, any attack
through these applications can lead to leakage of confidential
information and embarrassment. In this session, we'll give attendees
tips and tricks to prepare them for the potential of "stormy weather."
