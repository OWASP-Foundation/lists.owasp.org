Also, we will talk about 'Threat Intelligence'  - it's a huge buzz word
now. What is it, what isn't it.

Message-ID: <CAHpuCECYDed4w1uN8Bkt7vuu1V=yyVEHzVu7as_8ytJsDO=CtA@mail.gmail.com>

Hope you all are enjoying your summer. Our next OWASP RI meeting will be on
Wednesday, July 29, 6:30 pm at Swipely, 10 Dorrance St, Providence. Our
speaker will be Ben Brown from Akamai Technologies, presenting "Defending
Against Doxxing". Information below, and please RSVP by either replying to
this email or on our Meetup site. Pizza and drinks are supplied courtesy of
Swipely. Thank you!

Abstract and Why This Topic is Important: Doxxing is the Internet-based
practice of researching and broadcasting personally identifiable
information about an individual. It is also a scourge on our internet lives
that can quickly boil over into the physical realm. Often wielded as a
weapon of hate or manipulation and a tactic for intimidation doxxing easily
leads to real-world threats of violence, financial harm, sexual assault,
career damage, or even murder. Examples of these impacts can be seen
surrounding the recent events of 'GamerGate' through the targeting of Anita
Sarkeesian, Felicia Day, Tara Long, and Brianna Wu. Doxxing also often
leads to another tragic outcome; that of targets for hate being
misidentified leading to unaffiliated individuals becoming the subjects of
attack. Occurrences of this can be found in such online sagas as Anonymous
vs. Scientology, the Amanda Todd case, and the incorrect fingering of Sunil
Tripathi as the Boston Bomber. Given the real world impacts of being doxxed
what can we do to protect ourselves, our friends, and our loved ones? In
this talk I will highlight common methods employed by doxxers as well as
methods to safeguard the information they seek. I will move from the easy
wins and low-hanging fruit, with an eye for practicality, to the more
complex and long-term defenses employed by professionals. While this is a
pertinent topic for everyone I believe it is especially important for those
who's livelihoods involve spending copious amounts of time interacting with
the internet. Our Doxxing attack surfaces are larger than those for others.

Bio: Benjamin Brown currently works on systems safety, adversarial
resilience, and threat intelligence at Akamai Technologies. He has
experience in the non-profit, academic, and corporate worlds as well as
degrees in both Anthropology and International Studies. Research interests
include novel and side-channel attack vectors, radio systems, the
psychology and anthropology of information security, metacognitive
techniques, threat actor profiling, intelligence analysis, and thinking
about security as an ecology of complex systems.

Access in Maliceland - Risk Based Access Control
John Lambert observed attackers win because while defenders think in lists,
attackers think in graphs. Access control systems divide the system a
priori into secure and insecure states. But that?s only worth the paper its
printed on. A  Attackers see the system as it is, for attackers, the access
control scheme is the beginning of the game not the end. Determined
attackers seek out access control models and then find holes that they can
leverage. Access control systems that purport to protect the system are
built on assumptions from which reality diverges. Application security
needs a new approach to access control- adding feedback loops for risk
based decisions,  fine-grained, dynamic access control.

Security is a business with a very long list of issues and requirements.
The spreadsheets are miles long. This makes it essential to find reusable
solution patterns that can address multiple problems.This presentation
looks at both medium term improvements and code examples to improve access
control decisions and overall security today


Gunnar Peterson (@oneraindrop) focuses on security architecture consulting
and training. Experience includes Associate Editor for IEEE Security &
Privacy Journal, a Microsoft MVP for App security, an IANS Research Faculty
member, a Securosis Contributing Analyst, and a Visiting Scientist at

Subject: [Owasp-boston] Remote First Use IdentityProofing/Authentication
Message-ID: <CANrqO3JHKkG1sdw+a2gwTVP5LgW4tEmcUf7FFg=628z1fPt6eA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all.  We have all had an opinion about the merits of KBA, but most
have focused on the authentication case for a user known previously to the
website provider using shared secrets between the claimant and the provider
or intermediary for static KBA. What if that is not the case?


Please help us brainstorm an alternative approach perhaps dynamic in
addition to or instead of static KBA in the following use case?



A Human User with no previous experience/contact with a Service Provider
wants and needs to interact with a Service Provider or intermediary broker
remotely, without a prior exchange of identity attributes. How does the
Service Provider/intermediary know with sufficient assurance the identity
of this Human User?



How might we add high level guidance for our OWASP authentication
piktochart to address a Remote First Use for Identity
Proofing/Authentication?

Ann Racuya-Robbins  KBA-PMP  Co-Leader and Project Manager
