face="Times New Roman" size=3>Web Services are usually associated with the 
"triumvirate" of SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. However, over the past 18 months, REST 
Web Services have enjoyed increasing popularity. Although the theory surrounding 
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is complex, the practice is simple: use 
long-established Web technologies instead of SOAP. REST Web Services are 
addressed using HTTP GETs and POSTs to send and receive plain-XML (as opposed to 
SOAP) documents to URLs. The so-called "mega Web Services" offered by Google, 
Amazon, and Yahoo! all feature REST interfaces which have proven to be very 
popular amongst developers, especially when compared to their SOAP-based 
equivalents. Clearly, REST Web Services have much in common with Web 
applications, but there are also important differences (for example, cookies 
have no place in the REST architecture). <BR><BR>In this talk, we examine the 
security implications of REST. We ask a number of questions:<BR><BR>- Can Web 
Application Security techniques adequately protect REST Web Services? <BR><BR>- 
Since REST Web Services cannot use WS-Security, does that mean they are 
insecure?<BR><BR>- What security guidelines can you offer to developers who are 
using REST Web Services?<BR><BR>- What do XML security vendors do to protect 
REST Web Services?</FONT><BR></SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Identity federation is a collection of technologies 
that reduces the number of<BR>passwords that users must posses and 
administrators must maintain. Instead of maintaining one password per-site, 
identity federation allows users to "re-use" their logins from one site to 
securely access applications at a second site. <BR>This talk will provide an 
overview of this area. It will discuss standards such as SAML, Liberty Alliance 
ID-FF and ID-WSF, WS-Federation and Shibboleth. It will also survey the progress 
made in actual deployments in this space, as well as some of the unresolved 
challenges.</FONT></DIV>

New Presentation Uploads - 
Our June speaker, Arian Evans from Fishnet Security, did some more work on
his presentation (Security Tools Survey) and delivered it at the OWASP 2005
conference in Washington DC. a couple of weeks ago. If you were at our
meeting you will remember Arian was somewhat bombastic and iconoclastic
towards various tool vendors, and his presentation now has lots more
information and semi controlled experimental data. Over 80 slides and very
interesting. There's a URL on our page and a link on the OWASP home page to
all the OWASP conference presentations.
 
Prateek Mishra's (chair of the OASIS SAML committee) presentation on SAML
and Federated Identity is also available.

one of those things where&nbsp; as a developer, lead tech designer or 
project/software architect you often feel that having figured out when, where 
and how your data encryption is done, means you've taken care of the encryption 
part of your project. Then as you get into actually deploying it, or you get hit 
with regulations or PCI standards, you realize key management is the hard part 
and the part that really effects your security, data design, database 
schema&nbsp;and program architecture, much more than selecting the crypto 
algorithm and key size, initialization vectors etc. This applies whether you're 
doing a web app, web service, internal app, handheld app 
etc.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

contain security logging and auditing functions, but they may seldom be used due 
to limited knowledge or lack of efficacy. Simultaneously, security is a vital IT 
topic, and organizations are overwhelmed by regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley 
(SOX) that increase database privacy and auditing requirements, taxing the 
database and DBA.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><?xml:namespace

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">This 
presentation covers the complexities of security and auditing projects (e.g., in 
a SOX or PCI initiative), as well as vulnerabilities and attacks that exist or 
have been used within various database environments. While both SOX and PCI 
require auditing and encryption level data protection, these can be achieved 
without turning on additional database functionality like logging or encryption, 
and without changing the applications that use the database. By watching queries 
as they enter the database, alerts and blocking actions can be initiated based 
on behavior rules instead of signatures. This also reduces the need for upstream 
application level defenses which have to recognize obfuscated malicious queries 
(e.g. UNICODE or UTF encoded SQL) because at this point the SQL must be ready to 
be interpreted by the database<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Topic: A Study of AJAX Hacking </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a method 
of building interactive applications for the Web that process user requests 
immediately. AJAX is an aggressively evolving software development technology 
used by industry leaders such as Google and Microsoft. However, this new 
technology presents many security concerns because AJAX-based applications are 
susceptible to the same types of common vulnerabilities overwhelmingly found in 
Web applications; they just need a little more determination by the hacker to 
exploit. <BR><BR>This presentation demonstrates how AJAX works and how it is 
vulnerable to threats typically associated with Web applications with examples 
of hacking techniques used to compromise an application using AJAX. In addition, 
the presentation will explore how the technology underlying AJAX opens up a 
number of other interesting vulnerabilities that all organizations looking to 
deploy AJAX should be aware of. <BR></FONT></DIV>

Application Defense is a software solution that protects existing J2EE 
applications from losing private data, leaking valuable information or 
performing unwanted tasks caused by the actions of hackers and malicious 
insiders. Its patent-pending technology works within the application itself to 
monitor and protect against attacks such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting 
and request tampering.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

Fortify Application Defense can insert filter functions in front of the external

<DIV><SPAN class=900023817-28042006><FONT face=Arial size=2>This means a web 
site uses URL parameters to determine where the user will be redirected to. This 
vulnerability was exploited in the govbenefits.gov site a few months ago to 
propagate a phishing scam. From the Netcraft web site "Open redirects have not 
previously been thought of as a security risk, because they do not allow access 
to a company's computer systems. However, fraudsters are actively using open 
redirects to facilitate their phishing scams. These tactics are rather analogous 
to borrowing a bank's sign and premises to execute a sting."</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

Subject: [Owasp-boston] No December Mtg, Jan is set
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB434EBC4@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

The bad news is pneumonia has felled our Dec. speaker from CriticalSites,
and I was unable to get another 
speaker, so you'll have more time for shopping next Wed. CriticalSites is
very willing to speak and we'll 
have them in the future.
 
The good news is we have a speaker and topic for Jan. 4. Can't afford large
consulting fees to help with your 
crypto related problems or questions? This meeting could be the answer!
"Tips from the Trenches: working with 
cryptography and key management in applications". Dave Low, Sr. engineer
from RSA will share his experiences 
working with customers (who will remain nameless), talking about successes
and not so successes, good 
practices and not so good practices. This is not crypto 101 or 300 or an RSA
product discussion; but practical advice and anecdotes. While Dave obviously
works for RSA, the customer problems, successes and good practices are
really product independent. Dave will briefly cover the basics of whatever
crypto technology is involved in each example so everyone can 
understand the example. 
I'll also be prepared to talk about my experiences writing an enterprise
encryption standard and guidance 
document, retrofitting encryption to existing data and web applications,
encryption options available in various web application frameworks and other
enterprise web application data encryption topics.
