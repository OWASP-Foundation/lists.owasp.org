Date: Tue, 6 Sep 2016 16:31:49 -0400
Subject: [Owasp-boston] Sept 28 Meeting at DemandWare 6 pm
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKm+zmiagRCgWMRbg6vWEgOoWRbJzsNbM8pSu=RqrxJyjA@mail.gmail.com>

*6:00 - News, Announcements*

*6:15 - OWASP Top 10 #1 - Injection Flaws*

Jim Weiler will discuss XML External Entity Injection flaws; how it works,
how to prevent, code examples.

6:45

*From the Frontlines of RASP Adoption*

*Goran Begic, VP of Product, IMMUNIO*

Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) is one of the newest
technologies coined by Gartner and it is in early stages of adoption in the
industry. It promises dynamic defense and automatic mitigation of
vulnerabilities in web applications.


This presentation is a summary of experiences from several dozens of
commercial evaluations and early adoptions in production that took place
this year and provides some examples of situations and challenges that are
not specific to any individual vendor. In this talk Goran will provide an
overview of buying criteria and evaluation requirements across different
industries and some typical pitfalls that can slow down adoption.


After the introduction and a brief reminder on the technology Goran will
invite audience to participate in discussion about organizational
requirements for adoption and operationalization of RASP. Questions for
discussion:

?       My application is under attack. What actions should I take? Who
owns the response?

?       Which attacks should I respond to and which ones can I ignore?

?       How to get started with mitigation provided by technology?

?       Does RASP fit with DevOps?

?       Does RASP help with remediation?



What this presentation is not: This is not a product pitch in any way.
Evaluation criteria, comparison of RASP with IAST and other security
technologies, personal experiences and examples discussed in this talk are
generally applicable to all RASP solutions.

Key takeaways: At the end of the presentation you will:

?       get a better understanding of requirements for evaluation of RASP
and its use cases,

?       if you can pull a successful evaluation alone, or if you will need
participation of other groups / teams

?       learn about critical criteria for success of RASP in production

?       how this criteria different relative to appsec testing tools.

Saturday, October 1, 2016 from 8:30 AM to 6:30 PM (EDT)
Burlington, MA
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2016_BASC_Homepage


The OWASP Boston Chapter's Boston Application Security Conference (BASC) is
a free, one day, informal conference, aimed at increasing awareness and
knowledge of application security in the greater Boston area.

While many of the presentations will cover state-of-the-art application
security concepts, BASC is intended to appeal to a wide-array of attendees.
Application security professionals, professional software developers,
software quality engineers, computer science students, and security
software vendors should be able to come to the BASC, learn, and hopefully
enjoy themselves at the same time.

To obtain more information on BASC and sign up, please visit:

This is NOT for OWASP BASC 2016,
We have free passes to SC Congress that can be shared by OWASP booth
volunteers.
Setup is just taking the OWASP collateral out of the boxes at the booth;
breakdown is just taking any leftover collateral with you and bringing it
to one of the OWASP Boston board members sometime.

http://www.sccongress.com/boston/

Working the booth just means telling people about OWASP in general and the
local chapter activities and handing out the stuff below.
There will be an expo table for OWASP - Booth #14.  The set up time is from
7:30am - 9:30am, Expo Floor opens at 10:00am.  Breakdown is 4:30 pm. There
will be two packages sent for the conference.

If you want to help reply to this email and I'll send you the volunteer
registration link.

The following are being shipped:
100 pens
50 stress balls
50 because the world is cruel sticker
50 community cloud sticker
50 yellow cinch up drawstring backpacks
Flyers
AppSec USA postcards

Thanks, Jim
