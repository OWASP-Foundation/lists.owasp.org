Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston 4/04 Meeting Canceled - we lost the room
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4A56D@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

Hi Folks,
The Microsoft room controllers just informed me that our normal room will be
unavailable this Wed. and they do not have another room that night. Since
we're all used to the first Wed. of every month I think the best thing is to
cancel the meeting and re-schedule Mark for the next meeting he can do. I
think this is the first time in 3 years we lost the room with no substitute
but it's still annoying. Sorry everybody.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston May 2 meeting - Mark O'Neill
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4A571@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

Hi Folks,
Mark checked his calendar and is on for the May 2 meeting, same topic (but
better with age). Maybe I can come up with a tool talk by then too. (anybody
else want to talk about a web app tool they know about?)
 
Thanks, Mark.
 
p.s. The Microsoft room controller was very apologetic and promised that
this would not happen again.

*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. May 2  
 
I'm trying to have the meetings provide more unique information than
technology presentations whose information is often available elsewhere.
I've been trying to get speakers that can tell about experiences they've
had, things that worked and didn't work, good if not best practices, for
real world situations.  Mark was an OWASP Boston presenter before, and his
talk at RSA pointed out some things I never heard of. He's had lots of
experience with web services security and we'll get the benefit of some of
that at the meeting. I think it's worth listening to anyone who describes
the security company they work for as "a" leading .....vendor, not "the"
leading ... vendor. After that you gotta believe everything else he says is
true. 
 
Tool Talk: Jim Weiler
Topic - new Web Application Vulnerability training lessons in WebGoat 
 
Main Speaker: Mark O'Neill, Chief Technical Officer at Vordel 
Topic: Case Notes from a Vulnerability Assessment performed on a financial
services Web Services application  

This presentation describes a real-life vulnerability assessment that was
conducted on the Web Services applications of a financial services
corporation. The vulnerabilities which were discovered are explained, and
countermeasures are proposed. Testing strategies are described. The Vordel
SOAPbox tool was used as a launch-pad for the attacks used in this
vulnerability assessment. All customer information has been anonymized. 

Mark O'Neill is Chief Technical Officer at Vordel, a leading Web Services
Security vendor. Mark is the author of the book "Web Services Security",
published by McGraw-Hill/Osborne Media. A frequent conference speaker on Web
Services Security, Mark also provides training on secure Web Services to
governments (including US Government agencies), insurance companies, and
telecoms companies worldwide.
