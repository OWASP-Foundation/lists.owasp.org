Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston Dec. 7 meeting
Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E606C8575E@fraexmb5.staples.com>

Topic: Enigma variations: Key Management controlled.
The Allies cracked the Germany high-command's Enigma ciphers in the 2nd
world war principally due to weaknesses in the German's key management - not
because of their weak crypto algorithms.
 
With the growing application of cryptography to protect organisation's
digital assets, key management again becomes of paramount consideration. We
examine some of the major challenges and approaches.

Folks, this topic is one of those things where  as a developer, lead tech
designer or project/software architect you often feel that having figured
out when, where and how your data encryption is done, means you've taken
care of the encryption part of your project. Then as you get into actually
deploying it, or you get hit with regulations or PCI standards, you realize
key management is the hard part and the part that really effects your
security, data design, database schema and program architecture, much more
than selecting the crypto algorithm and key size, initialization vectors
etc. This applies whether you're doing a web app, web service, internal app,
handheld app etc.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] [Owasp-world] Happy Holidays from OWASP
Message-ID: <064601c60127$9dbc6640$3604a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

To all the OWASP participants worldwide,

 

 As 2005 comes to an end I want thank you all for making OWASP a success!
With a growing membership and skyrocketing downloads we are making a real
difference in finding and fighting the causes of application security
vulnerabilities.

 

Through your hard work in 2005, OWASP has released a completely overhauled
Guide, powerful new features in WebScarab, and hosted two successful AppSec
conferences. Our downloads have more than doubled to over 16,000 every
month, our unique visitors have doubled to almost 35,000 every month, and
our bandwidth requirements have soared 600% to over 18GB per month.

 

Our New Jersey chapter has arranged for a Holiday discount for OWASP
participants.  From now through December 31st, get 30% off any books you
order through http://www.oreilly.com/buy. Just use Discount Code HOHOHO when
you place your order.

 

Have a wonderful Holiday season and best wishes for the New Year.

 

--Jeff
