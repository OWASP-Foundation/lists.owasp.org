News, discussion, announcements 6:30 - 7 pm

Main presentation 7 pm -  - JavaScript Verification: From Browsers to Pages

Modern web browsers implement a "private browsing" mode that is intended to
leave behind no traces of a user's browsing activity on their computer.
This feature is in direct tension with support for *extensions*, which let
users add third-party functionality into their browser. I will discuss the
scope of this problem, present our approach to verifying extensions'
compliance with private browsing mode, and sketch our findings on several
real, third-party extensions. I will then briefly describe the toolkit
underlying our approach, and end with a sketch of a newer project, adapting
this approach to the very different-seeming problem of statically catching
errors when using the jQuery library.

Presented by -
Benjamin Lerner has just completed a post-doctoral research position in the
PLT group at Brown University, and is now a lecturer at Northeastern
University.  His research examines the challenges of analyzing client-side
web programming, from the behavior of web pages down through the semantics
of the browser.  He received a PhD in Computer Science from the University
of Washington in 2011, building a platform to analyze conflicts between
browser extensions, and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from
Yale University.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] Feb. 5 meeting - Akamai 6:30
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKnSDY1qZbDoeE-61ECUBO5am9Xig6Ov9Mg7-wUpuFpUAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,
One of the things we'll be doing going forward is to try to have 3 or 4
meetings a year devoted to training on OWASP security topics, not just a
technology presentation.

So we're starting this schedule by having the Feb. 5 meeting as a training
session on

1. SQL Injection - intro (what is it, what can you do with it, how to
prevent); intermediate - real world example of attacks (how does malware
get onto 'drive-by' web sites that serve malware?); advanced - how do web
application vulnerabity scanners check for SQL Injection and false
positives.

2. Cross Site Request Forgery

We may have some more training topics for this meeting.

Would anyone like to do a short training session on some topic?

We'll also have the usual news review, including the Target breach,
announcements etc.
