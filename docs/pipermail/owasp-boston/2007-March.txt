Subject: [Owasp-boston] Meeting this Wed is ON!!
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4BD353F@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

Speaker - Jeremiah Grossman
Mr. Grossman founded WhiteHat Security in 2001. Prior to WhiteHat, Mr.
Grossman was an information security officer at Yahoo! responsible for
performing security reviews on the company's hundreds of web applications.
As one of the world's busiest web properties, with over 17,000 web servers
for customer access and 600 web applications, the highest level of security
was required. Mr. Grossman is a founder of the Web Application Security
Consortium (WASC) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
Jeremiah speaks at Blackhat, Defcon, and I saw his talk at RSA, which was
great. Jeremiah has a great depth of knowledge, experience and anecdotes,
and is a very friendly, interactive guy (I once spent 15 minutes on email
with him after a webcast asking questions and more questions). So bring your
questions and enjoy Jeremiah's discussion of the top 10 attacks of 2006 by
creativity and scope; what these attacks mean for website vulnerability
management in 2007 and strategies to protect your corporate websites.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston April 4 meeting
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4A4EB@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. April 4  
 
I'm trying to have the meetings provide more unique information than
technology presentations whose information is often available elsewhere.
I've been trying to get speakers that can tell about experiences they've
had, things that worked and didn't work, good if not best practices, for
real world situations.  Mark was an OWASP Boston presenter before, and his
talk at RSA pointed out some things I never heard of. He's had lots of
experience with web services security and we'll get the benefit of some of
that at the meeting. I think it's worth listening to anyone who describes
the security company they work for as "a" leading .....vendor, not "the"
leading ... vendor. After that you gotta believe everything else he says is
true. 
 
I'm still going to try to do a tool talk but I wanted to get this notice
out. 
 
Speaker: Mark O'Neill, Chief Technical Officer at Vordel 
Topic: Case Notes from a Vulnerability Assessment performed on a financial
services Web Services application  

This presentation describes a real-life vulnerability assessment that was
conducted on the Web Services applications of a financial services
corporation. The vulnerabilities which were discovered are explained, and
countermeasures are proposed. Testing strategies are described. The Vordel
SOAPbox tool was used as a launch-pad for the attacks used in this
vulnerability assessment. All customer information has been anonymized. 

Mark O'Neill is Chief Technical Officer at Vordel, a leading Web Services
Security vendor. Mark is the author of the book "Web Services Security",
published by McGraw-Hill/Osborne Media. A frequent conference speaker on Web
Services Security, Mark also provides training on secure Web Services to
governments (including US Government agencies), insurance companies, and
telecoms companies worldwide.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - Special additional meeting - 8:00 pm
	- Thurs. 3/29
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4A50B@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

Dinis Cruz,  Chief OWASP Evangelist - Direct from London. You may have seen
the emails that Dinis sends out to the OWASP membership on various OWASP
topics.  Dinis will be in Boston on Thursday and wanted to present to and
meet the local members, so I'm setting up an additional meeting at our usual
place.  This is a great chance to learn about all the tools, information and
projects OWASP has to offer.  Dinis will present 2 topics - 
*	Buffer Overflows on .Net and Asp.Net - One of the common myths about
the .Net Framework is that it is immune to Buffer Overflows. Although this
might be correct in pure managed and verifiable .Net code, large percentage
of .Net and Asp.Net applications code is unmanaged code. In this talk Dinis
will show the areas in .Net and Asp.Net applications that are vulnerable to
Buffer Overflows (including the demo of a .Net Buffer Overflow Fuzzer). 

*	OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project - The Open Web
Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to
enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications that
can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, blogs, and chapters are
free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. In
this presentation Dinis will show the latest guides and tools from OWASP
which should be part of every company's security efforts.
