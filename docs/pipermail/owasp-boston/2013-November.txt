   *Beating XSS with CSP*

   Cross-site scripting is a vulnerability that has plagued web
   applications since their existence. A technology known as
   content-security-policy (CSP), when implemented correctly, can mitigate
   cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and also force better development
   practices. This talk discusses what CSP is, how it works, and some
   challenges in the adoption of this technology

      * Advancements in Windows Registry Forensics*

      The Registry is a complex database containing valuable information
      related to hardware, software, and users on Microsoft Windows
systems. For
      far too long the digital forensics and incident response
community has been
      merely scratching the Registry's surface by using outdated tools and
      methodologies. In this presentation, Mark Spencer, president of Arsenal
      Recon, will discuss the current state of Windows Registry
forensics and the
      development of Arsenal's Registry Recon.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP RI: Unmasking DDoS Protected Web Sites
Message-ID: <CAHpuCECKr0cH1V2cjPBJG87jSjfmWsbmukqmE75j0DiueFg1TA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all-

Our next OWASP RI meeting will be on November 25 at 6 pm at Swipely, 39
Peck Street in Providence.

We will have Allison Nixon, fresh off her talk at Black Hat in Las Vegas to
show how to bypass DDoS-protected web sites. If you would like to
participate, please bring the following setup:

Laptop with a WiFi connection, Kali Linux installed with Perl, Wireshark
and ability to run as root. Please also have an email address where you are
able to view the mail headers. Lastly, it would be helpful if you do have
access to your own web server, though this one is not a requirement to
participate.

We're looking forward to seeing you on November 25th and we thank Allison
and Swipely for hosting us and providing refreshments.

Lastly, AppSec USA is next week in New York City. Hopefully I'll see some
of you there!
