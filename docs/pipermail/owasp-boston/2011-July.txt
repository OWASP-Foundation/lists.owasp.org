No meeting this week, we have scheduled the July meeting for Monday the
25th at Microsoft Waltham, a double presentation with Anurag Agarwal on
web application security threat modeling - a new tool; and  web
application scanning. Anurag was the project lead for the Web
Application Security Consortium  web application scanner evaluation
project.

I've received requests for more presentations on web app vulnerability
scanners, so we have Anurag Agarwal, who was the original leader for the
Web Application Security Consortium - Web Application Security Scanner
project. This was the first project to do comparative analysis of web
app vuln scanners. He is also working on a software threat modeling
tool, so this meeting will have 2 presentations - described below.
Bring your questions, this should be a great meeting.  

 

Anybody want to sponsor pizza?

 

Feel free to send me your questions in advance and I'll forward them to
Anurag.

 

Title: False Positive, False Negative and False Sense of Security

 

Abstract:

This interactive session will talk about the pros and cons of using
black box testing tools and discuss their effectiveness in building a
mature software security program. This session will also mention how
companies worry about false positives coming out of a scanner technology
but overlooking false negatives leading them in a false sense of
security. This half presentation, half Q&A session will highlight what
works and what doesn't work in scanner technology and present case
studies where companies got hacked even after using scanners on their
apps. 

 

 

Title: Managing Risk with Threat Modeling

 

Abstract:

 

Threat & Vulnerabilities are gaining momentum at many companies today
because of the recent hacks at Sony, PBS, CIA and other high profile
companies that have a mature vulnerability assessment or static analysis
process. Traditionally companies have relied on vulnerability assessment
or static analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities but recent hacks
have proved that it's not enough. The correct approach is to use threat
modeling to identify vulnerabilities and vulnerability assessment or
static analysis tools should be used to validate if that vulnerability
is actually mitigated. More and more organizations have realized that
identifying threats in the design phase and planning a mitigation
strategy helps them in saving time, money, brand value and generally
overall risk. Threat Modeling can help by guiding the Application
Development Teams to ensure your Security Policies get properly coded
into the Applications at time of Development.  By creating pre-approved
methods of coding for your development teams, and applying them in a
repeatable and scalable process, you can assist your development teams
in building a secure application easily and effortlessly.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - some questions for tonight
Message-ID: <DC5EB591689C7B478D9B310B08778D653F75B3@stcexcpmb03.corp.star>

Hi Anurag,

I know you might not get this before the meeting but if not, I'll ask at
the meeting -  

1.       Do scanners that use instrumented web browsers as their main
technology have fewer false positives or more accurate response behavior
compared to scanners that emulate browsers? 

2.       What are the algorithms used to determine that a SQL injection
vulnerability exists? Do any scanners provide confidence levels in their
findings?

3.       What features allow a scanner to be more easily used as a
penetration test tool, beside recording user actions for replay?

4.       With software threat modeling, do you start from the 'inside
out', i.e. where's the data to protect and how could the controls
closest to the data be compromised, or do you start 'outside in', with
the threat agent from the internet and follow how they could get into a
web app from the outside? Is this even a useful question?

 

See you tonight,

Jim
