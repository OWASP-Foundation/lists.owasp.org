Speaker Bio - 

Mr. Grossman founded WhiteHat Security in 2001. Prior to WhiteHat, Mr. Grossman was an information security officer at Yahoo! responsible for performing security reviews on the company's hundreds of web applications. As one of the world's busiest web properties, with over 17,000 web servers for customer access and 600 web applications, the highest level of security was required. Mr. Grossman is a founder of the Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Jeremiah speaks at Blackhat, Defcon, RSA and OWASP chapters. Jeremiah has a great depth of knowledge, experience and anecdotes, and is a very friendly, interactive guy.

Main Topic - Business Logic Flaws: How they put your Websites at Risk
Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are
just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that
malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. These  types
of vulnerabilities are routinely overlooked during QA because  the
process is intended to test what a piece of code is supposed to do and
not what it can be made to do. The other problem(s) with  business logic
flaws is scanners can't identify them, IDS can't  detect them, and Web
application firewalls can't defend them. Plus,  the more sophisticated
and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more  prone it is to have flaws
in business logic.The presentation will  provide real-world examples of
how pernicious and dangerous business  logic flaws are to the security
of a website. We'll also show how  best to spot them and provide
organizations with a simple and  rational game plan to prevent them.

For the record, I think what Jeremiah means by "business-logic flaws" is
just flaws that you can't scan for.  Most of them are just good-old
authentication, access control, validation, and sensitive data protection
problems.  There are real business logic flaws though and they are
exceedingly difficult to find.  For example, the transaction limit on this
is $1000.  Or this report should never be issued on Thursday.  You know it's
a *real* business logic flaw if you can't tell it's a problem without really
understanding the business rules and policies.

 

I'm a bit concerned that lumping together all the unscannable security
vulnerabilities into a single category called "business logic flaws" makes
it seem as though the scanning tools (and WAFs for that matter) are more
effective than they really are.  If they say "we find all categories of
problems except business logic flaws" it sounds pretty good.  Reality is
that they're finding the scannable ~30% of flaws in every category of
security problem. Doesn't sound so good now, eh?

 

It's a fun talk - wish I could be there.

Hi everyone,

 

Please don't read anything negative about Jeremiah into my previous message.
He's been very up front over the years about pointing out things that
scanners can't do.  The examples in his talk are fun and interesting and not
at all misleading.  I was just making a small point about terminology. Sorry
for coming across more negative than I intended.
