There will be 2 parts to the first presentation of the meeting, by Fortify -

Topic: Application Defense-Software That Fights Back!

In the last decade, the majority of security breaches occurred when networks
were broken into directly. Today, however, most security threats and
exploits derive from hackers maliciously manipulating software applications,
without ever breaching perimeter network defenses. The reality is that
software applications have changed little to address these new
software-based attack strategies. This presentation explores a new and rich
field: software application forensics and countermeasures. By using
real-world examples, this session will define and demonstrate technical
topics like attack surface, pattern recognition, tracers and method guards.
The audience will leave with an understanding of cutting-edge techniques for
strengthening software code and preparing for business discussions about
liability and post-intrusion investigation. This session will also
investigate common preventative and forensic tools such as intrusion
detection systems and application firewalls.

Topic: New Tools and Techniques to Help Discover Software Security Flaws 

A major contributing factor to information security problems we experience
exist because of software developed without security in mind. Whether it's
weak security requirements, design flaws, poor coding practices, or
oversights in software testing are leading to serious security problems with
the software our businesses rely on. Changing processes and how developers
work can be quite an undertaking; however, there are methods that anyone
involved in the software security process can use to see immediate security
improvements.

1. MAY MEETING 


	The regular, monthly meeting will be on Thursday, May 18 at 6:30 PM.
As usual, it will be held at the Microsoft office in Waltham, MA.
[Directions on our website at  <http://www.neisg.org> http://www.neisg.org].
The meeting will start with a general introduction to the user group,
followed by an open Q&A period and then the keynote presentations.

	"The State of Security: 2006" presented by Andrew Briney, vice
president and publisher of the TechTarget Security Media Group and a member
of the ISSA Hall of Fame

	Everyone involved in security knows that the only constant is
change: new threats, new business demands, new technologies, new roles and
responsibilities. These and other challenges can be quite overwhelming if
you don't have a big-picture perspective on how other professionals in the
industry are dealing with them. In this presentation, Andrew will review the
results of several recent surveys conducted among more than 470,000 IT
security professionals. Taken as a whole, these surveys offer a broad view
on the state of security in 2006, including insight into A) changes in IT
threat vectors and what to do about them, B) enterprise security spending
drivers, trends and wish lists, C) how the role of security and the security
professional is changing and D) five things every security pro must know.

	>> If you have not yet done so, please send a courtesy e-mail to
Meetings at neisg.org indicating that you plan to attend the meeting so that we
can order the correct quantity of pizza.

	Looking for Volunteer: Willing to give a 30-minute demo/presentation
on the software/technique of your choice?  Please let me know as soon as
possible.  This is not meant to be a commercial pitch for your company's
product...individual volunteers are preferred.

2. JUNE MEETING 


	The June meeting will be held at the Microsoft TechEd conference in
downtown Boston. In addition to being off-site, it will also be slightly
off-date. The meeting will occur on Monday, June 12, at 7:00 PM. This
corresponds to the first full day of the TechEd conference. The
presentations will be given by the Infragard Division of the United States
FBI and NetClarity. [Note: You do not need to be a registered attendee of
TechEd to attend this meeting, however you will not be able to enter the
actual TechEd seminars or expo unless you have paid separately for those
events. Details on TechEd are available at
<http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2006>
http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2006.]

	Also, if you happen to be attending TechEd, make sure to come to my
Birds of a Feather discussion on Thursday, June 15 at 10:15 AM. The topic
will be "End-Users: The Weakest Link in the Security Chain - What Can We Do
To Make Them Secure?"   Description: As system and network managers, we try
our best to enforce security, write acceptable use policies and lock down
the network to protect ourselves against all levels of threats. Yet
end-users are notoriously the weakest link, using simple passwords posted on
sticky notes, not locking workstations, downloading malicious files and
much, much more. In this open forum, we will discuss the most common issues
that we face when dealing with end-users and also describe some of the
methods that we've used or want to use to bring them into compliance to keep
our systems secure.
