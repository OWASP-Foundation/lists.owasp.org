Subject: [Owasp-boston] Consultants wanted for OWASP BASC conference
Message-ID: <B9D5C5F0F4D84F4E98635ED04D11FC7501B4832B@stcexcpmb06.corp.star>

Hi Folks,

If you've ever felt that you had so much more web application security
knowledge to give to the world than you've had a chance to do so far,
this is your opportunity.  We will have 12 1 hour Consultant Corner
sessions (6 in each of 2 small meeting rooms) that you can sign up for
to answer questions in your stated area of expertise, from whatever BASC
attendees come thru the door. Attendees will sign up for 15 minute
sessions at the conference on a signup sheet outside each meeting room
(kind of like signing up for time on your favorite Stairmaster at the
gym). 

 

This is an experiment in knowledge sharing. The idea is that a focused
15 minute conversation with a knowledgeable person can be very efficient
to clear up a lot of misconceptions, explain some exploit, steer someone
in a better direction, explain some technical problem etc. Vendors are
free to sign up, but in keeping with the OWASP charter, these sessions
must be product neutral. Products and technologies that address a
particular problem can be talked about, compared etc. but we don't want
these to be simply side demos of products. Every vendor I've had at my
OWASP chapter meetings over the last 5.75 years has been very respectful
of OWASP's neutral stance, and I'm sure we can continue that tradition
while still providing useful knowledge to the attendees that sign up.
It's up to you to decide what area you want to answer questions about.

 

If you're interested, email Bill Terwilliger
[bill_terwilliger at harvard.edu]. Bill is the C3 (Consultant Corner
Coordinator). He will assign you a time slot and room (you can have up
to 2 slots) and record your area of expertise. The slots are an hour
each from 10 - 4. If you have any questions please email Bill and I.

 

Jim

Date - Wednesday December 1

 

Time - 6:30 p.m.

Main Topic - Application Architecture Security Assessment  - Second
session:

Presenter - Rob Cheyne, Safelight Security Advisors

In the December 1st session, Rob will conduct a sample architecture
assessment against a real-world system, and in the process, teach
participants how to conduct an architecture of their own.  Brave
volunteers will be welcome to share their own architectures and have
them reviewed. This is an opportunity to get free consulting that
typically costs thousands of dollars.  There is limited time, so not
every one will get chosen.  If you are interested in this, please
contact Rob Cheyne (rcheyne at safelightsecurity.com) directly.

Additional information:

Penetration testing is a common way to evaluate an application's
security.  Yet a comprehensive architecture and design assessment can
uncover critical security issues that often cost far less to resolve
early on in a project.  Many companies overlook this element of system
design.

Rob was one of a select few at security consulting company @stake who
regularly led and conducted full-blown enterprise-level architecture
assessments for Fortune 500 companies.  Drawing from his experience with
dozens of real-world architecture assessments over the past 12 years,
and his 20 years as a software developer, architect, and consultant, Rob
teaches students to challenge assumptions that frequently lead to
long-term security and reliability problems.
