<PRE>The position will have to go through one of the approved staffing
vendors for the employer. If you feel you are qualified, contact me
directly and I will connect you with the vendors.

If you are a sales-person for a consulting company that is OK, too.
Just understand that the employee will HAVE TO go through an existing
staffing vendor, with whom I have no relationship.

If you are a recruiter, same rules apply. But if you don't have a
candidate ready, you will probably be wasting your time.
