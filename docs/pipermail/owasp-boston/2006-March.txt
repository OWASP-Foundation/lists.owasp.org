Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - security podcasts review
Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E606C85A13@fraexmb5.staples.com>

I've been listening to lots of Computer Security presentations on my iPod
(MP3 files), and despite Business 2.0 magazine saying podcasts are not
'hot', I've found them a great way to spend some of the 5 hours a week
commuting time I have. I thought I'd share my opinion of the ones I've
found, and maybe some of you can let us know your opinions of any security
podcasts you know of. Most of these I found using iTunes as the podcast
aggregator, but I've included their direct links and their own self
description. I only included the ones you can subscribe to, not single
podcasts.

Generally no one's background, experience or job is described. None of these
are particularly about web application security except MightySeek, but they
can be interesting. There are others explicitly about network or VOIP
security that I have not included. I've included the iPod display and iTunes
description in order to judge how easy it is to select the one you want on
your iPod and to manage them in your library, like remembering which ones
you've listened to and deleting them.

There are some more to review but I wanted to get this list out. I'll send
out another set of reviews later. Let me know what you think.

Security Wire Weekly
SearchSecurity.com's Security Wire Weekly audio download is a brief newscast
recapping the week's top security news stories, as well as interesting
developments that you may not have known about.
http://feeds.feedburner.com/blogspot/ZhKn
JimW comment - 
just like it says, someone reading some news.
iPod display - 'Security Wire Weekly' and the date. Nothing on items covered
iTunes description - eventually lists the topics after telling you it's the
Security Wire Weekly edition of some sort, the reporter, and their title.
sound quality - good
 
Security Now!
TechTV's Leo Laporte and Steve Gibson take 20 to 30 minutes near the end of
each week to discuss important issues of personal computer security.
Sometimes we'll discuss something that just happened. Sometimes we'll talk
about long-standing problems, concerns, or solutions. Either way, every week
we endeavor to produce something interesting and important for every
personal computer user. 
http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm
JimW's Comments - 
This is the best of all. There is a single topic which is well described and
well explained; every 4th podcast is listener Q+A. 
iPod display - The podcast name which appears in the iPod window contains
the topic and episode #
sound quality - very good
format - Host/tech speaker - Steve Gibson does most of the talking with Leo
asking useful questions and providing summations.
 
PaulDotCom Security Weekly
http://www.pauldotcom.com/security_weekly/ IT Security news, research,
vulnerability discussions, and interviews.
JimW comments - 
after 2 to 7 minutes discussing the host dudes various personal events of
the previous week, the topics mentioned above are discussed, with frequent
non-topic asides. If you are familiar with the exploits, news, research etc.
already, you will understand the discussion and comments, but sometimes the
situation, technology or procedures are not explained, sometimes they are. 
iPod display - 'PaulDotCom Security Weekly', episode, date.
iTunes description - exactly the topics covered, need to right click and
select description to see it all.
sound quality - good for the 2 main speakers, poor for anyone else.
format - host/cohost (both very technical), various others (also very
technical). 
 
SploitCast
Welcome to SploitCast, the podcast for hackers, geeks, and the security
paranoid. We are a group of students and IT professionals that have decided
to start a downloadable talk show. SploitCast will discuss a wide variety of
topics; these include, but are not limited to, new vulnerabilities, exploit
code, security and technology news, and possibly even cute little bunny
rabbits (but don't hold your breath). The SploitCast crew will also be
conducting interviews and round table discussions with other members of the
security industry
JimW coments - 
technical dudes discussing various computer security events, with frequent
non topic asides.

http://www.securitycatalyst.com/ <http://www.securitycatalyst.com/> 
 
crypto-gram Security Podcast
reading of Bruce Schneier's crypto-gram newsletter
JimW comment -
 reading of Bruce Schneier's crypto-gram newsletter. The newsletter is
Bruce's comments on events of all kinds (political, technical, scientific,
computational), usually discussing some security aspect of that event.
Useful to hear security aspects (anonymity, authentication, authorization,
privacy, accountability, prevention, deterrence etc.) applied to real world
events.
format - reading of Bruce Schneier's crypto-gram newsletter
iPod display - 
iTunes description - each description has the same first 100 characters, I
never got out to the whole description for any episode.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] [Owasp-world] Reminder: 2006 European OWASP AppSec Conference - May 30-31, 2006 near Brussels
Message-ID: <02db01c650e0$f9251050$1204a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is holding its annual European AppSec (Application Security)
Conference May 30-31, 2006 at the Catholic University of Leuven (aka
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or K.U. Leuven) in Leuven, which is 25 km
from Brussels.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES: Early registration for the conference ends April 30.
The reduced rates for the conference hotels ends mid to late April depending
on the hotel.

AGENDA: This conference has dual tracks like last years' US conference. The
speakers and agenda are available on the OWASP website at:

             http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html.

This year's speakers include popular speakers from previous conferences like
Dinis Cruz and Ivan Ristic, but also includes many new speakers to the OWASP
Conference, including Andrew Van Der Stock (project lead for the OWASP
Guide), Roger Thornton (CTO of Fortify), Mike Andrews of Foundstone, and
myself (Dave Wichers - COO of Aspect Security).

NEW: We also have introduced for the first time two panels, which should
generate some lively debate. The first panel is on "Should companies be
emulating Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)?" and the 2nd is
on: "Are we winning the war?" - Are we actually getting a handle on
application security issues and making things better, or are things still
getting worse?

REGISTRATION DETAILS: Registration is open and the conference fee is 300
Euros for early registration and 350 Euros for registrations after April 30,
2006.

TUTORIALS - May 29, 2006:

OWASP has arranged to have two one-day tutorials the day prior to the
conference. These one day tutorials will be held at the university and are
only 600 Euros for conference attendees.

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE: This powerful hands on course
focuses on the most common web application security problems, including the
OWASP Top Ten. The course introduces and demonstrates hacking techniques,
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students
really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code. 

WEB SERVICES and XML SECURITY: The movement towards Web Services and Service
Oriented architecture (SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to
deal with new risks posed by these architectures. This session takes a
pragmatic approach towards identifying Web Services security risks and
selecting and applying countermeasures to the application, code, web
servers, databases, application, and identity servers and related software.

More details on these training courses are available at:

        http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/training.html 

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - May 30, 2006: The traditional evening dinner/social
event is being held at the nearby Faculty Club. The Faculty club is a
restaurant annex conference centre located in a medieval part of Leuven. We
can walk there from the conference, and will have a social hour followed by
a 3-course dinner. Dinner is typically followed by drinks nearby. The dinner
event is 40 Euros.

HOTELS - We have arranged for conference rates at nearby hotels. Many of
these rates expire mid to late April, so please book early. More information
is available at:

 
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/accommodations.html 

If you know others that would be interested in attending this OWASP
conference, please forward them this email and let them know about this
opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Thanks, Dave

*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. April 5  
 
We will start at 6:30 with SPI Dynamics because the SPI Dynamics folks have
to catch a plane after the presentation.
 
Speaker: Dennis Hurst, Senior Security Engineer: SPI Dynamics 
 
Topic: A Study of AJAX Hacking 
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a method of building interactive
applications for the Web that process user requests immediately. AJAX is an
aggressively evolving software development technology used by industry
leaders such as Google and Microsoft. However, this new technology presents
many security concerns because AJAX-based applications are susceptible to
the same types of common vulnerabilities overwhelmingly found in Web
applications; they just need a little more determination by the hacker to
exploit. 

This presentation demonstrates how AJAX works and how it is vulnerable to
threats typically associated with Web applications with examples of hacking
techniques used to compromise an application using AJAX. In addition, the
presentation will explore how the technology underlying AJAX opens up a
number of other interesting vulnerabilities that all organizations looking
to deploy AJAX should be aware of. 

 
Speaker - Jim Weiler
Topic - Using Paros Proxy Server as a Web Application Vulnerability tool -
Part 1
This is the first in a multi part presentation about using proxy servers in
web application security. I'll cover Paros first, then OWASP's WebScarab.
Each proxy will be covered over the course of multiple meetings.
We'll go over the basics of using Paros to record all HTTP requests and
responses, examine the headers and bodys of the requests and responses for
security related things and see how to trap, change and resend requests.
We'll cover some of the rules and vulnerabilities of the HTTP protocol.
 
Pizza will be provided by SPI Dynamics
