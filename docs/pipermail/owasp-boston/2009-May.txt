Here's a better description of tonight's talk. Joey has 6 PCI QSA's
reporting to him so he has lots of  knowledge of web app development
that is submitted as compliant and what PCI expects for compliance. If
you've heard of BSIMM and / or OWASP OPEN SAMM  and are wondering about
them, bring your questions and comments.

Secure SDLC: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

This isn't your father's Secure SDLC talk folks!  Join Joey Peloquin,
Director of Application Security at FishNet Security, for a real-world
peek into the secure application development lifecycle. He'll share
real-life anecdotes of good, bad, and ugly development programs, how the
PCI DSS affects application security from a QSA's perspective, and what
makes real application security programs across the nation tick.
Finally, he'll wrap up with a detailed post-mortem of his own first
attempt at a program, how it was flawed, and how his team put the pieces
back together.
