Hi all!

We're back for 2014 with another meeting for OWASP RI. Even better, we're
in a new location with our sponsor Swipely. We've moved our meetings to the
new Swipely location at 10 Dorrance St. (http://goo.gl/maps/TQxew) The
meeting will be on the 9th floor, but you will need to check in with
security. Also, please simply RSVP to patrick.laverty at owasp.org as we need
a list of people who are coming, for the security desk.

Ok with that out of the way, the meeting info is as follows:

Preventing XSS with CSP

Cross-Site Scripting is one of the most pervasive web application security
flaws, and one attackers frequently target for attack. While the best line
of defense for Cross-Site Scripting is defensively programming with proper
input validation and context-sensitive output encoding, Content-Security
Policy is quickly becoming a very effective mitigation strategy to protect
sites' visitors and to warn application developers of potential attacks.
This talk will cover content injection (including Cross-Site Scripting) and
how Content-Security Policy mitigates many of the associated risks.

Will Stranathan is an application security professional in the Charlotte,
North Carolina area. He's been writing rotten code for 32 years, and has
spent the last ten years breaking rotten applications, analyzing rotten
code, and writing rotten code which helps the world's best programmers
identify their own rotten code, and training developers how to write code
that's not so rotten.

===================

You can follow OWASP RI at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Rhode_Island to
find out about future meetings. We do already have speakers for March and
April as the topics will be "Open Source Intelligence" and the "OWASP
Broken Web Apps Project".

Meetings are always free and open to anyone who wants to attend. So yes,
please spread the word and please forward this email to anyone else who may
be interested.

If you would like to present at a future meeting, please just let me know,
or even if you have suggestions on topics, as speakers usually ask "What do
you want to hear?"

Meeting location and refreshments are supplied by our generous sponsor,
Swipely.

Thank you and I hope to see you on the 12th!

I'm sure some diehards would make it but let's minimize risk; we'll do 3
training sessions at the March meeting including the SQLi session.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] call for training sessions at March 5 meeting
Message-ID: <CAKEaLK=nv6Xzv=7hwb=4tEVtCOo_1X26eCjTy8u3L8-yRC_Opw@mail.gmail.com>

In keeping with our plan to offer some training only meetings, the March 5
meeting will be the training session we planned to have in Feb.
We have 2 open 45 min slots out of 3 slots (SQLI will be 1 slot) I'd like
to ask if anyone could do a training presentation on any OWASP tools like
ZED, ESAPI, WebGoat, CSRFGuard or other OWASP tool projects; or other
how-to presentations. If you think something is useful but can be presented
in less than 45 min that's fine, let me know what it is.

And if you have suggestions for what you'd like to learn about send those
too or join the  discussion on the meetup
