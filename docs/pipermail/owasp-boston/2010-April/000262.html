Agenda: 6:30 - 7 - what's happening in OWASP and how it might be useful
to you, general Q+A, networking 

Main Presentations 

7 pm - SafeLight Lightning Talk Series by Rob Cheyne of Security
Advisors - Intro to SQL Injection 

In the first of the Safelight Lightning talks series, Rob will present
the basics of SQL injection. In this talk, he will cover the attack
methodology used by professional attackers, along with detailed
demonstrations of one of the most common OWASP Top 10 issues out there.
The Lightning talks are designed to provide value to members that are
newer to OWASP and are interested in understanding the basics of web
application security, although everyone should feel free to attend and
ask whatever questions they have. 

Many people don't realize just how dangerous a SQL injection attack can
be. After demonstrating how SQL injection can be used to run system
commands and gain root access on a database server, Rob will provide
practical tips for defending against SQL injection flaws in your own
applications. 

 

7:30 - Vinnie Liu - Data Exposure, New Approaches to Open Source
Intelligence Techniques, and Incident Handling 

As data sharing has become easier and more popular we've seen an
increase in the amount of sensitive data that is exposed. In this
presentation we'll broaden our horizons and learn to think differently
about your online presence and how to protect it. Whether you're trying
to protect yourself or protect an organization we'll examine some of the
root causes of how your secrets are exposed. 

In addition, nearly all Google hacking tools must be throttled to avoid
getting blocked. We'll identify some advanced open source intelligence
gathering techniques and disclose a new Google hacking technique that
will change the way people mine search engine data. Whether you're a
penetration tester or not extremely technical we'll demonstrate some
tips that you can use on the job or play with at home. We'll also
explore how to prevent, detect, and respond to data leakage incidents.
