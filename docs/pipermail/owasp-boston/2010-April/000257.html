Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,
Sixth Floor Waltham, MA. 

&gt;<i>From Rt. 128 North take exit 26 toward Waltham, East up the hill on Rt.
</I>20. From Rt 128 South take exit 26 but go around the rotary to get to 20
East to Waltham. Follow signs for Rt. 117 (left at the second light).
When you get to 117 turn left (West). You will cross back over Rt. 128.
Jones Rd. (look for the Waltham Weston Corporate Center sign) is the
second left, at a blinking yellow light, on Rt. 117 going west about 0.1
miles from Rt. 128 (I95). The office building is at the bottom of Jones
Rd. Best parking is to turn right just before the building and park in
the back. Knock on the door to get the security guard to open it. The
room is MPR C.
