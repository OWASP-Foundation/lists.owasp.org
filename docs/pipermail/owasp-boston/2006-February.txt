1. FEBRUARY MEETING 


	The regular, monthly meeting will be on Thursday, February 16 at
6:30 PM. As usual, it will be held at the Microsoft office in Waltham, MA.
[Directions on our website at  <http://www.neisg.org> http://www.neisg.org].
The meeting will start with a general introduction to the user group,
followed by an open Q&A period and then the keynote presentations.

	A> "Steganography: What Is It And Why Should I Care?" 
The word steganography is derived from the Greek words steganos, which means
cover, and graphy, which means writing. Thus, steganography literally means
"covered writing." Covered writing has been used throughout history for
secret communications. Criminals, including terrorists, have always sought
ways to conceal their activity in real or physical space. The same is true
in virtual, or cyber, space. 

	Digital steganography represents a particularly significant threat
today because of the large number of applications on the Internet that can
be used to hide any digital file inside of another digital file. Use of
these applications, which are both easy to obtain and simple to use, allows
criminals to conceal their activities in cyberspace. Thus, steganography
presents a significant challenge to law enforcement as well as the
commercial community because detecting hidden information and then
extracting that information is very difficult.

	Glenn Watt, CEO of Backbone Security (
<http://www.backbonesecurity.com> http://www.backbonesecurity.com) will
provide a presentation and live demonstrations on steganography that will
explain what it is, how it works, and how it might affect you.

	B> Book Swap - Have some old books that you aren't using any more?
Looking to pick up a few new titles for yourself?  Join us for our first
book swap.  Bring up to five titles that you want to swap.  Include your
name on a piece of paper tucked into each book so that we can identify it as
yours.  Then surf the tables for titles that interest you.  The only rules:
1)  Books should be security-related, or computer-related in general, 2)
Books should not be so ancient that no one will want them (such as How to
Configure Networking in WFWG 3.11) and 3) You must take home any books that
you brought and that were not taken by someone else.

	>> If you have not yet done so, please send a courtesy e-mail to
BDinerman at neisg.org indicating that you plan to attend the meeting so that
we can order the correct quantity of pizza. This month's pizza will be
sponsored by Backbone Security ( <http://www.backbonesecurity.com>
http://www.backbonesecurity.com).

1. Writing Secure Code for Software Developers - Tuesday, March 14, 2006
The Westin, Waltham MA.

Join software experts from Macadamian, Liquid Machines, Watchfire and Ounce
Labs for this half-day workshop in Waltham, MA. You'll learn to build secure
software applications from the inside out, starting with secure code. It
will be language agnostic and will cover the different tactics to take at
different parts of the lifecycle - doing code reviews with an eye to
security, testing for security, knowing the common exploits, secure coding
practices. Save by registering before February 26, 2006: Advance
registration price: $95.00. Regular price: $120.00 after Feb. 26. Learn more

You know the drill- don't code buffer overflows, watch the SQL Injection,
use a firewall, do the threat thingy, but you know there is more.  You know
that security is a war and you can't win by following a few rules.  You have
to wage war in the same take no prisoners style that the hackers use.  Come
to the Mini Code Camp Security Edition where Duane Laflotte and Patrick
Hynds (the original Geeks in Black) will show you what the enemy is doing as
well as how to secure your position. Security is a war, don't fight fair!
 
As always, the Code Camp Series represents the best technical content of the
local developer community. The Code Camp is free and guaranteed to be the
most fun that you can have in any day camp. This is an exclusive
mini-session that is not to be missed!

Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E606C8599D@fraexmb5.staples.com>

*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. March 1  
 
Two presentations this week - Matteo Meucci from OWASP Italy is in Waltham
next week and volunteered to give a presentation on a web application
vulnerability he worked on.
 
Speaker:Matteo Meucci - CISSP, OWASP-Italy Chair
Topic -  <A case-study of a Web Application vulnerability
 
We describe a case-study of a public MMS (mobil phone message) service
provided by a TELCO. 
This vulnerability would allow an attacker to send a spoofed MMS charging
the credit of an unaware user. 
This analysis shows how poor session management of a web application can be
used to break the authentication scheme. We want to show how a two factor
authentication can be broken if developers write bad code (a trivial error
of session management)
 
 
Speaker: Ambarish Malpani, VP of engineering and CTO of Cenzic
Topic: Too many applications, not enough time. How to get Quality Results
with Automated Vulnerability Testing
 
Web application vulnerability scanning (aka fault injection scanning) is a
way to test for common input validation errors as well as other errors in
functioning web sites. By crawling the site and analyzing the HTML they can
test lots of vulnerabilities in a short time. Cenzic will discuss how these
test results can be made more meaningful, for example, if an input page does
not have it's data displayed in the immediate response page, how can you
find cross site scripting vulnerabilities?
 
Pizza will be provided by Cenzic
 
Location:
Microsoft offices at the Waltham Weston Corporate Center, 201 Jones Rd.,
Sixth Floor Waltham, MA
 
Directions:

From Jim.Weiler at Staples.com  Tue Feb 28 12:36:07 2006

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - Wed. March 1 Meeting Update
Message-ID: <0D79B67AA1920446B5F4921CA87264E606C859BC@fraexmb5.staples.com>

The presenter from Cenzic will be their Senior Vulnerability Research
Analyst, so you will be able to ask more technical questions about web
application vulnerabilities than you might have otherwise.
 
Tom Stracener is Cenzic's Senior Vulnerability Research Analyst. Tom has
been a leading technologist in the security space for over 6 years. Tom was
the head of vulnerability research for nCircle and various consulting and
open source projects. He invented the industry's first numeric vulnerability
scoring system and is the co-inventor of 6 network security technologies
with patents pending. He is the author of many security related whitepapers
and has spoken at various conferences on network and application security
topics. He is also responsible for the critical application alerts that
Cenzic's research lab, Cenzic Intelligent Analysis (CIA), issues on a
monthly basis

Also, Guy Osa, the local Cenzic sales rep really doesn't like Domino's pizza
so he will be getting us pizza from Pizzarina Uno.
