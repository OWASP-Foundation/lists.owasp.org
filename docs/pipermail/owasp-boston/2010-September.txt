Hi Folks,

As we keep working toward making our free 1 day Boston Application
Security Conference 2010 a reality (Saturday, Nov. 20; Microsoft NERD),
we need some help. Below are some tasks that need to be worked on before
and during the conference. Since the conference is free I can't offer
you a free pass for helping, just some self satisfaction for helping
make it happen, maybe some non security skills and experience for your
resume, and maybe some free OWASP merchandise. The general tasks are
listed below, call me to find out more if you're at all interested.

 

Pre - conference

EE_COnference_-__Saturday_November_20_Microsoft_New_England_Research_and
_Development_.28NERD.29.2C_Cambridge_MA.

 

Caterer Liason - choose the caterer (there is a short list who have
worked with MS NERD events before), plan the menu, make sure they
deliver the food. All $ goes thru OWASP, no need to handle $.

 

Publicity - do you know any Computer Science professors to send them a
conference description; we want to attract computer science students
that don't know about application security. Any other publicity ideas -
write a press release for security sites and mags.

 

 

 

Conference Day help

            General - Make sure sponsor booths have what they need, make
sure speakers are present and know which room they are in (there are
only 2), help caterer set up if needed

            Signage - put up room signs, banners, 

            Check in - check people off the registration list, give out
name tags and program, anything else we give out

The OWASP Boston chapter (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston) would
like to announce a call for papers for the Boston Application Security
Conference 2010; Saturday November 20, Microsoft New England Research
Center, Cambridge MA.

 

This will be a free, one day informal conference, to try to increase
awareness and knowledge of application security in the greater Boston
area.

 

There will be two tracks: Track 1 - Basic/Current Application Security,

 

Track 2 - Future / Advanced / New Research in Application security. 

 

Each presentation will be 50 minutes.

 

We hope to attract both people who are new to web application security
as well as people who are experienced in web application security.

 

Please email a copy of your presentation abstract to each member of the
program committee:

 

jim.weiler at starwoodhotels.com

Mark.Arnold at computershare.com

zach at n0where.org

 

This call for papers will close Oct. 10. We will decide on the final
presentations by October, 17 and notify all submitters ASAP after that
date.

 

Please refer to the OWASP Speaker Agreement at

I think that we should not give out the registration link.  I believe
that the only link we distribute should be the homepage,
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/2010_BASC_Homepage. I've added a link to
the registration page. That page now has a conference announcement, a
summary of the conference and pointers to directions to the NERD, a
pointer to the registration page, and a pointer to the call for papers.

Hi Folks,

If you don't want to give us the email of someone in Academia that you
inform about the conference, that's fine. The main thing is what
institutions/departments have been notified. It's important to get the
department, because a college or university will likely have multiple
departments we might want to notify; e.g. Computer Science, EE, the same
departments in the night school or extension college.

 

Thanks, Jim

Next meeting - Wed. Oct 6. Microsoft Waltham. This is the first of a 2
part session. The second part will be Wed. Dec. 1.

 

We will still have a November meeting, featuring Pravir Chandra, project
leader for OWASP Open SAMM.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Mode
l#tab=Main

 

Overview:

In this highly interactive two-part workshop, Rob Cheyne of Safelight
Security will show you the basics of conducting a real-world
architecture & design review. 

This workshop draws from Safelight's Security Architecture Fundamentals
training course, a two-day course frequently used to teach Fortune 500
companies how to look at their system architectures from both the
hacker's and the designer's point of view.  

First session:

In the first session on October 6, Rob discusses a practical approach to
architecture review and threat modeling using real-world examples. This
session lays the foundation for participants to participate in a
real-world architecture review in the December session. 

Attendees will learn:

            - How to holistically examine a system architecture for
security issues from both the designer's and the hacker's point of view

            - To identify frequently overlooked areas where security
vulnerabilities commonly occur

            - Tips for assessing a system at the host-level, network
level, and application level

            - Practical ways to apply threat modeling to help manage
risk 

Second session:

In the December 1st session, Rob will conduct a sample architecture
assessment against a real-world system, and in the process, teach
participants how to conduct an architecture of their own.  Brave
volunteers will be welcome to share their own architectures and have
them reviewed. This is an opportunity to get free consulting that
typically costs thousands of dollars.  There is limited time, so not
every one will get chosen.  If you are interested in this, please
contact Rob Cheyne (rcheyne at safelightsecurity.com) directly.

 Who should attend?

Anyone can participate and learn from the discussion in this accessible
and dynamic workshop.  Whether you are an architect, a developer, or a
manager, there will be something here for you.  Come learn to challenge
your assumptions.

Additional information:

Penetration testing is a common way to evaluate an application's
security.  Yet a comprehensive architecture and design assessment can
uncover critical security issues that often cost far less to resolve
early on in a project.  Many companies overlook this element of system
design.

Rob was one of a select few at security consulting company @stake who
regularly led and conducted full-blown enterprise-level architecture
assessments for Fortune 500 companies.  Drawing from his experience with
dozens of real-world architecture assessments over the past 12 years,
and his 20 years as a software developer, architect, and consultant, Rob
teaches students to challenge assumptions that frequently lead to
long-term security and reliability problems.
