<PRE>Hi Everyone:

I'm just sending this out as an FYI on OWASP's discount on the upcoming
Source Conference Boston 2016 and training.


Regards,
Roy


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Big Brain Security is excited to be hosting SOURCE Boston 2016 on May
18-19th, and pre-conference trainings on May 16-17th at the Courtyard
Marriott Downtown Boston!



The SOURCE Conference, Boston&#8217;s premier Information Security conference,
specializes in bringing business, technology and security professionals
together to discuss practical solutions to real-world problems. Established
in 2008, the SOURCE Conference provides a unique environment for learning,
networking, and exchanging ideas and solutions for today&#8217;s information
security challenges.



*Benefits of SOURCE Boston 2016:*

- 3 Tracks

*- Over 30 speakers!*

- Outstanding personal and professional development opportunities

*- 2 days of pre-conference training opportunities - great opportunity to
complete some CPEs for the year*

- Networking opportunities with some of Boston&#8217;s best and brightest
InfoSec, business, and technology professionals

- Intimate conference environment where you can engage directly with the
speakers and attendees

*- Interactive sessions and workshops *



*SOURCE is not just another place to come see talks!*

Although we do have some fantastic talks lined up for you, we specialize in
being a highly interactive environment. *Many of our attendees say this is
one of their favorite conferences of the year, and they come back year
after year.  *



*This year&#8217;s keynotes include:*

*Richard Thieme, ThiemeWorks Presents* - &quot;Play Through the Pain? - The
Impact of Forbidden Knowledge on Security and Intelligence Professionals&#8221;.

*Richard is legendary in the infosec community, and has decades of
experiences as a presenter, author, and practitioner. This talk alone is
worth the price of admission.*



*Chris Nickerson, CEO, Lares Consulting *- &quot;The Nightmare of a Pentester&quot; -

Chris is a professional penetration tester who will be discussing the
tricks that his clients' blue teams use to keep him out of their networks.
He delivered this talk at SOURCE Seattle this year and it was outstanding.



*Deidre Diamond, Founder, Cyber Security Network *- &quot;10 Words to Stop Using
Now&#8221;

The better we choose our words, the more we hone our thinking,. If we can
think and speak with precision, we often avoid things like stress,
depression and conflict. Deidre will share with us 10 words to stop using
right now that can cultivate your thinking with more creative and
expressive word choice.



As usual, we also have an outstanding selection of speakers lined up. The
main conference is being held on May 18-19th, and our complete list of
speakers and topics can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.sourceconference.com/#!boston-2016-agenda/cr0g.">http://www.sourceconference.com/#!boston-2016-agenda/cr0g.</A> Trainings will
be held on May 16th-17th.



We are currently still offering our early bird pricing until April 30th,
and we&#8217;d like to extend an addition $100 discount to your group.



At-the-door price  $595

Pre-registration price   $495

*Early-bird price    $349*

Professional Discount:  -$100

*Your price, today:   $249*

<A HREF="http://www.sourceconference.com/#!boston-2016-registration/coqo">http://www.sourceconference.com/#!boston-2016-registration/coqo</A>



*Use the registration code: OWASP2016GA to receive an additional $100
discount off the ticket price. *



*Ticket prices will be going up after April 30th. Don&#8217;t wait! Buy your
tickets today! *



*But wait, there&#8217;s more - Local Infosec Training!*

In addition to the usual agenda, we have some excellent pre-conference
training offerings lined up for you. These are trainings that are rarely
held in the Boston area, so please take advantage of this opportunity while
its available.  We&#8217;ve set the prices low this year, and your professional
discounts make them even lower, so these should be a no-brainer at this
price. This is likely to be the lowest price you&#8217;ll ever pay for these
courses.



This year&#8217;s selection of trainings include:



*5/16/2016  -  InfoSec Train the Trainer    $495 (YOUR PRICE: $395)*

*5/17/2016  -  Application Security Risk for Executives and Managers   $495
(YOUR PRICE: $395)*

*5/16-17, 2016  -  Developing Custom Burp Extensions with Python (2 days!)
  $995 (YOUR PRICE: $795)*



*A few notes on the trainings:*

- The InfoSec Train the Trainer course will be taught by Rob Cheyne. It is
an extended version of the OWASP BASC Workshop he did last year that
was *STANDING
ROOM ONLY! *Not to be missed!

- The Application Security Risk for Executives and Managers course is the
course that *every manager and executive should attend. *

- And if Application Security is your thing, Jon Gorenflo, our guest
instructor, will host a* 2-day deep dive on using Python to get the most
out of Burp Suite*.

- ALL trainings include a free ticket to the SOURCE Conference, which if
you do the math, means you&#8217;re getting these courses at unheard of prices.

BSides ticket if there are still any left.



*Don&#8217;t forget! All trainings include a free ticket to the SOURCE Conference
on May 18-19, and a training ticket is your VIP entry to the full SOURCE
experience. Seats are limited, so register now to reserve your spot.*



This is going to be one of our best events yet, and we hope to see you all
there.
