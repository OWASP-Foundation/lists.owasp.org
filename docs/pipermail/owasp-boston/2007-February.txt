Subject: [Owasp-boston] No Meeting in Feb
Message-ID: <01d901c74748$ff35c5c0$0100a8c0@rockstar>

Sorry Folks,
I couldn't get a speaker for Feb.
However we do have a great confirmed speaker for March: Jeremiah Grossman, Founder and CTO of WhiteHat security. 
I'll send out more info on the topic later. For those of you that attended the memorable presentation to us by Arian Evans of Fishnet, Arian just joined WhiteHat.  I'll also have a report from the RSA Conference. See you in March.

  "Panel Discussion: Identity Theft and Protection - Corporate
Responsibility and Consumer Options"
Recent events in the news have slapped us all in the face with a reminder
that we need to be extra vigilant to protect our identity against those that
would compromise it. As consumers, we need to know the issues that we face
as well as the remedies in the event that our confidential data has been
stolen. As security administrators, we need to make certain that we do our
best to protect the data for those that have entrusted it to us, and we also
need to maintain a level of corporate responsibility when incidents do
occur.

We will moderate a panel discussion on these and related issues, as we
attempt to educate consumers and the industry and come to a general
understanding of the nature of identity theft and protection. The panelists
will include (subject to change):

 > Charles  <http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF000196> Kolodgy,
IDC Research Director of Secure Content and Threat Management
 > William M.  <http://www.mass.gov/legis/member/wms1.htm> Straus,
Massachusetts State Representative
 > Eric  <http://masspirg.org/MA.asp?id2=4534&id3=MA&> Bourassa, Consumer
Advocate, MASSPIRG
 > Steven Bearak <http://www.identityforce.com/> , CEO of Identity Force

 > Others to be announced.
