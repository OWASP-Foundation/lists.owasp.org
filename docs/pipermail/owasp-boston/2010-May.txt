Subject: [Owasp-boston] Boston OWASP - Vinnie Liu's more exciting
	description of tonight's talk
Message-ID: <0D8299A04960AE4C8906052835761AF10450EBCC@STCEXCPMB02.corp.star>

Vinnie thought his initial topic description was boring, so he sent this
one later - See you tonight.

 

During World War II the CIA created a special information intelligence
unit to collect and exploit information from openly available sources.
One classic example of the team's success was the ability to determine
whether bridges leading into Paris had been successfully bombed based on
increasing orange prices.  Since then the methods through which open
source intelligence (OSINT) can be obtained has surged in number and
diversity.  The internet has proven to be one of these information
wellsprings.  The sheer volume and detail of the information available
is a treasure to anyone who can properly filter the noise for the
signal.  For a time, search engines were the tool of choice for
filtering this information, but current search engine hacking techniques
fail miserably when anything useful needs to be accomplished. 

 

This presentation begins with a quick history of internet-based OSINT
and a survey of the most effective OSINT sources available today (e.g.
Google, Shodan).  After discussing the limitations of current methods
(e.g. Google Hacking), you might want to put a helmet on - so you don't
make a mess when we blow your mind.  Because the focus of this
presentation will be on hitherto unreleased search engine hacking
techniques that are insanely effective against both Google and Bing.
Full of real-world demonstrations, this lively talk will encourage
audience participation and open dialogue.  We'll also be sharing two new
tools, GoogleDiggity and BingDiggity, which take advantage these search
engine weaknesses.

 

Time-permitting, we will also discuss how to prevent, detect, and
respond to these attacks.

Rob Cheyne Lightning Talk - topic to be announced

 

Main Presentation - Ryan Barnett

The Web Hacking Incident Database (WHID) is a Web Application Security Consortium project dedicated to maintaining a list of web applications related security incidents. The databsae classifies each reported attack by, among other criteria, the attack method used, the application weakness exploited, the outcome of the attack and the industry and the country of the attacked organization. Based on the database Breach Security Labs, which sponsors WHID, recently issued a periodical report on trends in Web Application Security.

By providing answers to questions such as:

?   The drivers behind Web hacking.

?   The application weaknesses that are actively exploited.

?   The technology hackers use.

?   The types of organizations attacked most often.

?   The common outcomes

The presentation will discuss WHID statistics, focusing on trends in Web Attacks in the 1st quarter of 2010. The presentation will provide an overview of the top items, as well as, an in-depth review of Incidents of Interest.

 

Ryan C. Barnett is the director of application security research at Breach Security where he leads Breach Security Labs. He is a SANS Institute certified instructor and a member of both the Top 20 Vulnerabilities and CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Programming Errors teams. In addition to working with SANS, he is also a WASC Member where he leads the Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID) and Distributed Open Proxy Honeypots Projects and is also the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) project leader. Mr. Barnett has also authored a Web security book for Addison/Wesley Publishing entitled Preventing Web Attacks with Apache.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - Ligntning Talk topic for Wed mtg
Message-ID: <1D9B301D28EFDC49BBC6601EEF155DD301EF853A@stcexcpmb03.corp.star>

Hi Folks,

As part of our continuing series on basic web application security
topics, here's the Lightning Talk topic for this Wednesday's (June 2)
meeting at Microsoft Waltham;  by Rob Cheyne, Safelight Security
Advisors. This talk will take place before the main presentation  - 

 

In this installment of the Safelight lightning talks series, Rob will
present the basics of Cross-site scripting (XSS).  He will cover the two
primary methods of XSS attack, reflected and persistent, as well as
provide detailed demonstrations that show how an attacker would use
these attacks in the real world.

 

As part of the demo, Rob will go beyond proof of concept and present an
example of "weaponized" JavaScript that could be used to steal another
user's session information.

 

After the demo, Rob will provide practical tips for defending against
cross-site scripting flaws in your own applications.
