*******************************
Next meeting is 6:30 pm on Wed. Oct. 4  
 
Tool Talk - WebScarab  proxy from OWASP
Speaker - Jim Weiler
 
Main Topic: A Recent Evaluation of Web Application Firewalls
According to Forrester's January 2006 user survey of 83 technology decision
makers regarding securing personal data, preventing web site breaches is a
high priority for over 75% of IT decision-makers. Web application firewalls
are a necessary complement to your existing infrastructure protections to
stop these attacks. Forrester evaluated seven offerings in this space, one
Open Source project, and 6 commercial offerings, and will share our findings
in this presentation.
 
(Jim W comment - web application firewalls have been added to the latest PCI
requirements as 1 of 2 mechanisms for meeting requirement 6.6)
 
Speaker: Michael Gavin,  Senior analyst - Forrester Research
