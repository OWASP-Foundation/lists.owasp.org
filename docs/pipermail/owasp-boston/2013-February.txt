Subject: [Owasp-boston] Tonight! Off-grid communications with android +
	Secure API for your enterprise
Message-ID: <88D8C48F-A476-42F0-A763-D8C148B7C0C3@actbluetech.com>

As I was telling you guys last night?we start at 6:30pm sharp with free good beer & pizza

% curl http://www.meetup.com/boston-security-meetup

Off-grid communications with android

Join the SPAN team for a deep dive into the Android network stack implementation and its limitations, an analysis of the Wi-Fi chipsets in the current generation of smart phones and a collection of lessons learned when writing your own network routing protocol (or 5 of them). We will also share a "How To" walkthrough into implementing your own Mesh network and incorporating general "Off Grid" concepts into your next project; this will include securing your mesh from outside parties while tunneling and bridging through the internet.

Secure API for your enterprise

In this talk, Intel showcases how existing APIs can be packaged, promoted, and monitored as a portal managed service in the cloud. Intel presents how to deploy a proxy enforcement point that securely integrates legacy applications, tokenizes data, and orchestrates composite application packaging as RESTful APIs. See how this composite API platform bridges these two paradigms to manage the entire lifecycle APIs across on-prem and cloud environments.
