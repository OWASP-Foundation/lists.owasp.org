Hi Folks,

OWASP discount.

Topic - OWASP Exams Project

Presenter  - Ed Adams, CEO of Security Innovation

 

Ed Adams will present on the new OWASP Exams Project and the work being
done by the OWASP Academies Working Group.  This group has already
created a set of exam questions that can be used by universities and
industry alike to test knowledge in web application security. Ed will
walk through the questions and answers, and there'll be some giveaways
if you know the answer or even try.

 

The project also has a set of rich technical content, which Ed will
review in detail with the group, including a new self-paced
computer-based training course on OWASP Top 10. Ed will also discuss and
demonstrate the new open source tool that was offered to the OWASP
Community as part of the Exams Project - TeamMentor OWASP Edition. 

 

There'll be lots of technical content as well as meta information on how
to use and find this new OWASP technical content, and we'll have a bit
of fun in the process.

Ok Ok, Sorry - cut and paste strikes again. The April meeting is April
6, not May 6 as the body of my previous email stated. You people
actually read to the end of those emails? You're probably checking if
somebody's buying pizza. And, in fact, Security Innovation will be
sponsoring pizza.

 

Sorry, Jim

Hi all.

I realized that I still need to upload the video I took of Josh's talk last
month.

Can anyone recommend a place to upload it? I tried youTube and Vimeo but
both have length limitations that prevent me from uploading there. Suggests
for an alternate site would be greatly appreciated.

Alternatively suggestions for Linux tools that will split a video into small
parts would also be appreciated.

Thanks,

David

How about http://www.megaupload.com/  or http://www.dailymotion.com/us ?

Speaking of talks, does anyone have useful tips/notes from the Rob Cheyne/Safelight Security talk (or any practical info on giving security presentations) from Feb they'd like to share? I seem to be delivering more of these lately and would love to hear others' opinions.

Cheers,
