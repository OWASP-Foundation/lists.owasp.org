Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston - SPAM control
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB434EC4A@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

Hi Folks,
I think the spam problem is gone, on the assumption that if I haven't gotten
any, you haven't gotten any. Sourceforge updated the email list records,
which should have removed our names from that list, and the current OWASP
mailing system now generates an admin request for me whenever a non list
member tries to post to the list (got 7 today). Those non list members are
added to a list of senders to autodiscard, but the sender names are usually
autogenerated and change all the time, so I'll continue to get periodic
admin requests to handle them, and I just discard them.  
 
Hope to see you Jan. 3,
 
Jim
