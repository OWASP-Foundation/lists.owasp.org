Subject: [Owasp-boston] 4-6 Month secure coding/Secure SDLC contractor in
	Newton, MA 02459
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=tC=BfgvH0GWK5=xJxLYru0fbaiw@mail.gmail.com>

The position will have to go through one of the approved staffing
vendors for the employer. If you feel you are qualified, contact me
directly and I will connect you with the vendors.

If you are a sales-person for a consulting company that is OK, too.
Just understand that the employee will HAVE TO go through an existing
staffing vendor, with whom I have no relationship.

If you are a recruiter, same rules apply. But if you don't have a
candidate ready, you will probably be wasting your time.

There will be 2 presentations

 

Topic - OWASP Top 10 issue #4 - Insecure Direct Object Reference 

Presenter - Jim Weiler, Sr. Mgr. Information Security, Starwood Hotels
and President of OWASP Boston 

Jim Weiler will discuss threat models, risks and various remediations of
issue #4 in the 2010 OWASP Top 10 - Insecure Direct Object References. 

Topic - A Web-Application Architecture for Regulatory Compliant Cloud
Computing 

Presenter - Arshad Noor, StrongAuth 

The emergence of cloud-computing as an alternative deployment strategy
for IT systems presents many opportunities, yet challenges traditional
notions of data-security. The fact that data-security regulations are
developing teeth, leaves information technology professionals perplexed
on how to take advantage of cloud-computing while proving compliance to
regulations for protecting sensitive information. 

This presentation presents an architecture for building the next
generation of web-applications. This architecture allows you to leverage
emerging technologies such as cloud-computing, cloud-storage and
enterprise key-management (EKM) to derive benefits such as lower costs,
faster time-to-market and immense scalability with smaller investments -
while proving compliance to PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH and similar
data-security regulations. 

Presenter Bio 

Arshad Noor is the CTO of StrongAuth, Inc, a Silicon Vally-based company
that specializes in enterprise key management. He is the designer and
lead-developer of StrongKey, the industry's first open-source Symmetric
Key Management System, and the KeyAppliance - the industry's first
appliance combining encryption, tokenization, key-management and a
cryptographic hardware module at an unprecedented value. He has written
many papers and spoken at many forums on the subject of encryption and
key-management over the years.
