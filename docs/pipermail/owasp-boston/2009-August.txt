Hi Folks,

We're trying to reach a larger audience so we're having a meeting in
downtown Boston for Sept. The Sept meeting will be at Core Security, 41
Farnsworth St, Boston 02210; Thursday Sept 10. Speakers will be Paul
Asadoorian from  Pauldotcom.com and Alex Horan from CORE Security. This
is not a permanent time or location change, just trying to see if there
is a larger geographic audience.  More specific info to follow.
