Subject: [Owasp-boston] Meetings
Message-ID: <6C442F2A422C4B8D8F4EF58D803C460E@rockstar>

Hi Folks,
I'm still working on lining up speakers for our meetings. I have a one person program committee helping me now too. If any of you have suggestions for topics please send them to me, that would help us. I'm always interested to know what you want to hear about. 

If anyone wants to help get speakers or has presenter contacts just send me an email. You can do as much or as little as you want, and your fame and fortune will just naturally follow on.

Thanks, Jim
