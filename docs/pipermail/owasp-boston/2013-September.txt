We're less than an hour from Boston and we have a great talk coming up.
Please consider coming on down to Lil Rhody and check out OWASP Rhode
Island. The meeting is Monday, September 23, 6 pm at Swipely, 39 Pike St.
Providence, RI.

Talk by Dr. Benjamin Lerner:

JavaScript Verification: From Browsers to Pages

Modern web browsers implement a "private browsing" mode that is intended to
leave behind no traces of a user's browsing activity on their computer.
This feature is in direct tension with support for *extensions*, which let
users add third-party functionality into their browser.  I will discuss the
scope of this problem, present our approach to verifying extensions'
compliance with private browsing mode, and sketch our findings on several
real, third-party extensions.  I will then briefly describe the toolkit
underlying our approach, and end with a sketch of a newer project, adapting
this approach to the very different-seeming problem of statically catching
errors when using the jQuery library.

Bio:  Benjamin Lerner is a post-doctoral researcher in the PLT group at
Brown University, and soon to be a lecturer at Northeastern University.
His research examines the challenges of analyzing client-side web
programming, from the behavior of web pages down through the semantics of
the browser.  He received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of
Washington in 2011, building a platform to analyze conflicts between
browser extensions, and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from
Yale University.

Meeting space and refreshments will be provided by Swipely.

Abusing NoSQL DatabasesMING CHOW LECTURER, TUFTS UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF
COMPUTER SCIENCE

The days of selecting from a few SQL database options for an application
are over. There is now a plethora of NoSQL database options to choose from:
some are better than others for certain jobs. There are good reasons why
developers are choosing them over traditional SQL databases including
performance, scalabiltiy, and ease-of-use. Unfortunately like for many hot
techologies, security is largely an afterthought in NoSQL databases. This
short but concise presentation will illustrate how poor the quality of
security in many NoSQL database systems is. This presentation will not be
confined to one particular NoSQL database system. Two sets of security
issues will be discussed: those that affect all NoSQL database systems such
as defaults, authentication, encryption; and those that affect specific
NoSQL database systems such as MongoDB and CouchDB. The ideas that we now
have a complicated heterogeneous problem and that defense-in-depth is even
more necessary will be stressed. There is a common misconception that SQL
injection attacks are eliminated by using a NoSQL database system. While
specifically SQL injection is largely eliminated, injection attack vectors
have increased thanks to JavaScript and the flexibility of NoSQL databases.
This presentation will present and demo new classes of injection attacks.
Attendees should be familiar with JavaScript and JSON.

*Ming Chow* (@tufts_cs_mchow) is a Lecturer at the Tufts University
Department of Computer Science. His areas of work are in web and mobile
engineering and web security. He teaches courses largely in the
undergraduate curriculum including the second course in the major sequence,
Web Programming, Music Apps on the iPad, and Introduction to Computer
Security. He was also a web application developer for ten years at Harvard
University. Ming has spoken at numerous organizations and conferences
including the High Technology Crime Investigation Association - New England
Chapter (HTCIA-NE), the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General (AGO),
John Hancock, OWASP, InfoSec World (2011 and 2012), DEF CON 19 (2011), the
Design Automation Conference (2011), Intel, and the SOURCE Conference
(Boston 2013). Ming's projects in information security include building
numerous CTF challenges, Internet investigations, HTML5 and JavaScript
security, and Android forensics.
