Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP booth at BSides, Sat. May 18, MS NERD,
	Cambridge MA.
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKn1vE__bVSUtNNVBCnNkdw5u-W=xd-v8zKccF=DJpsGwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,
If you would like to help work the OWASP booth at BSides, I'm looking for
volunteers and a volunteer coordinator. You would just tell people about
OWASP, hand out the collateral, pens and stickers we'll have, and enjoy
meeting and talking to fellow infosec folks. Half hour, or hour shifts,
whatever you can contribute. Official booth volunteers that work the booth
will get an OWASP shoulder bag like the ones we raffle at BASC. Would
someone like to be the volunteer coordinator to keep the volunteer list and
assign time slots?

OWASP doesn't have the shoulder bags in stock that I promised if you
volunteer, so you can take a rain check until they get them or take one
of the hats I have, or just volunteer anyway because you're such a great
person. I just wanted to make sure I updated you on my initial offer.
