Message-ID: <CAHpuCECQCARJr+huunnKhTPQbi7avSGHHY04UKLSf+vvGwPn9A@mail.gmail.com>

A few months ago, I asked the group what topics they'd like to hear more
about, and one person shouted out "Armitage!", so here we go, we got a talk
on Metasploit and Armitage. This will be a talk from the ground up, what
they're for, how to use them, and so on. Bring your questions, bring your
ideas and Rob Kornmeyer will be with us to tell us all about it.

October 15th, 6:30 pm, 10 Dorrance Street, 9th Floor

As always, Swipely will be generously hosting and providing the
refreshments.

Please RSVP by either replying to this email or join our Meetup.com group
and use that. (
http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Web-Application-Security-Meetup-OWASP-RI/)

Also in the area of OWASP, the Boston chapter will be holding their annual
Boston Application Security Conference (BASC) on October 18th at 1
Cambridge Center (not NERD) in Cambridge. You need a ticket to attend, but
tickets are free: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2014_BASC_Homepage

We now have three videos up on our OWASP RI YouTube channel, in case you
missed a recent meeting:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD7buF7w8WuF3xfQPrkBiOw

Our upcoming meetings schedule:
November 5, Ed Martin from Dell SecureWorks talking about Web Application
Firewalls (WAF)

No meeting in December

January 21, Prof. Vic Fay-Wolfe, chair of the URI Forensics program will
come to talk about digital forensics.

February...could be you! Suggest one!

That's what we got upcoming, lots of exciting things! You can RSVP for any
of those meetings on our Meetup page. Hope to see you soon!

Hi Folks,
We need some volunteers to help out at BASC 2014. Tasks like registration
desk, room monitor, changing sponsor signage at the food station.  You will
still be able to attend presentations, you don't have to do any task all
day. If you'd like to help please contact laberdale at earthlink.net.
Volunteers will be able to attend the Speaker and Volunteer appreciation
session after the conference, and will go home with a great feeling of
accomplishment for having helped the digital world become a safer place.

I am in the market for a web application scanner.

I have experience with appscan, webinspect and acinetix, although with
older versions.

I am not looking for a service like Qualys or Whitehat at this time.

Any comments about these and anything else out there?

If you recommend a product, please share why you like it.

[ I am happy to receive comments from salespeople pushing their own
product, but in that case please email me directly instead of the list
]

Thanks in advance.

I had a good experience with WhiteHat last year. It's a SaaS product... Easy to setup and thorough. They have a service that also includes human review of the application to find security issues that are in the business logic.

We have had very good results with IBM App Scan. At a previous company we had very good results with HP WebInspect.

Dennis, I think the list would benefit from hearing your results.

I really enjoyed Veracode for static code analysis -- any chance they expanded in to web app scanning?  Would be nice to support those Boston based companies! ?. (Full disclosure: My only relationship to Veracode is as a customer at former employer).

Message-ID: <CAKEaLKkRLf-AEsgfGMi02EgUHF+CkfCxaWg==5CAgFiZXCuKGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,
OWASP BASC 2014 will have one room devoted to informal demonstrations and
explaining OWASP tools and software and other open source application
tools.  If you would like to demonstrate and explain any OWASP or open
source tools during BASC, please contact Mark Arnold at lotusebhat at gmail.com.
This is not for product demos, even if it is a free version of the
product.  You don't have to be an expert, but if you have used any OWASP or
open source software, you have experience that others could benefit from.
This was a big hit at AppSec USA in Denver last month. This is an informal
way to share with the Boston AppSec comunity and have fun. We call it the
OWASP   Petting Zoo because you get to interact with ( or ask the presenter
to try something with)  the software.

Thanks, Jim

Hi All:

Dependant on what you're looking for, I've had previous positive
experiences with IBM AppScan, HP Fortify (previously called WebInspect) and
Veracode. There's more today though to test as well.

Hi Folks,
We have a much smaller venue this year and cannot accommodate unregistered
walk-ins. Microsoft needs the list of registered attendees and you need to
show a photo ID, so if you couldn't register this year, I'm afraid  you'll
have to wait for 2015.

Sorry,
OWASP BASC 2014 Conference Committee

We?ve given up using a server based web app scanner (we had AppScan) and now use the Qualys service. I found that of the 42 options in AppScan that could affect the scan, most we never used, and some were poorly documented and I could not easily get the info, in a useful format, on what URLs were actually scanned. We wanted that to verify that we were scanning what we wanted.

I think you need to scan from the internet, not thru your company VPN or from inside your network out to the internet and back, to most accurately mimic an attacker. With the Qualys service you have no operational issues like server provisioning and maintenance, upgrades etc. we have also installed Qualys scan engine VMs on internal servers to scan QA, staging etc. and they are managed the same as the service.

Hi All:
Dependant on what you're looking for, I've had previous positive experiences with IBM AppScan, HP Fortify (previously called WebInspect) and Veracode. There's more today though to test as well.

We have had very good results with IBM App Scan. At a previous company we had very good results with HP WebInspect.

I had a good experience with WhiteHat last year. It's a SaaS product... Easy to setup and thorough. They have a service that also includes human review of the application to find security issues that are in the business logic.

Hey you might want to check these guys out: http://www.codenomicon.com/ 
I met their reps at the Triangle Infosecon here in Raleigh yesterday and 
they really have a great looking product. I myself never used it, but 
considering the sessions they ran and what I have seen on their site, 
they seem like a strong contender. The guys at the infosecon really new 
what they were talking about. Might not be quite what you are looking 
for, but maybe worth a look.

I'm biased obviously, but Contrast is an instrumentation based approach to finding vulns that works in realtime.  There are a number of advantages.  I talked at AppSecUSA about it http://youtu.be/VQ69Ib_oih8.  Or you can try the free Eclipse plugin http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/contrast-eclipse.
