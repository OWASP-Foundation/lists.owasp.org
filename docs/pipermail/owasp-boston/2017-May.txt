Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP BASC 2017
Message-ID: <CA+XD4xah8nTd5pzk3t-Ucg2sHvu9=M2gm_wbPP=J=6S_ryGvmg@mail.gmail.com>

Please save the date... BASC 2017 will be held on Saturday, October 21,
from 8:30 am-6:30 pm at the Microsoft Technology Center, 5 Wayside Road,
Burlington, MA 01803.  We are looking for Sponsors, Speakers, and Workshop
Leaders.



The OWASP BASC (Boston Application Security Conference) will be a free, one
day, informal conference, aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge of
application security in the greater Boston area. While many of the
presentations will cover state-of-the-art application security concepts,
the BASC is intended to appeal to a wide range of attendees. Application
security professionals, professional software developers, software quality
engineers, computer science students, and security software vendors will
come to the BASC to learn, interact and hopefully enjoy themselves at the
same time. We encourage local students, security professionals and
academics to present papers as a way to gain exposure and experience in
presenting at security conferences.

The CFP Link is: https://www.owasp.org...
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BASC_2017_Call_For_Papers>?

Further information about sponsorship, the Call for Workshops, and
registration will be mailed to this list as it becomes available.

Message-ID: <CAKEaLKkyF+XS=CqoC+exJC_dPzPp=cPGQOvMioGDfFQFrSD3vw@mail.gmail.com>

7:00 Is RASP Ready?     TCell.io     *Michael Feiertag, CEO and Co-Founder*

Runtime Application Self-Protection is overhyped, according to many
analysts and pundits. RASP promises applications that protect themselves -
which sounds impossible - how can an application possibly protect itself?
An agent that sits inside the app sounds like a deployment nightmare at
worst, and a drain on the app at best. What?s the reality? Where are we now
and what have we learned?

We?ve seen deployment successes and failures, and we will draw from those
specific experiences to describe:
Where does RASP work?
? What applications are well-suited for RASP?
? What types (organizational structure, culture, or skillset) of
organizations are well-suited for RASP?

What is the reality of RASP?
? Is RASP a deployment model or a feature set?
? How mature is RASP? Is it an over-hyped immature space, enterprise-ready,
or somewhere in between?
? Which RASP capabilities do organizations use? And how do they validate
those capabilities in their own environments?
? Can RASP replace the WAF?

We will conclude, not with a sales pitch, but some lessons learned on: the
three must have attributes for RASP, some suggestions on good candidates
for RASP ? both types of teams and types of applications, and finally - if,
how, and when to get started.

Michael Feiertag is CEO and co-founder of tCell.io.  Before co-founding
tCell at the end of 2014, Michael led a string of successful products ?
most recently as head of products at Okta, and prior to that, as technology
director at Blue Coat.  Prior to Blue Coat, Michael held product
management, engineering, and sales positions at several start-ups.  Michael
holds a B.S. from The University of Chicago, and an M.S. from the
University of Maryland.

Thanks Steve - I registered for the webinar.  :)

We've gotten some quotes for food.  It sounds like it would be around $500
for food each day.  We actually have 1 day already covered, so it would be
whatever the Sponsor would like to cover.

Regarding students, we just need folks to let us know how many students
they'd like to sponsor and we could just ask the Dean's office at whatever
school you'd like to host (or we can pick) for the student they'd like to
offer it to.

Thanks again for all the info and support!

- Mike
