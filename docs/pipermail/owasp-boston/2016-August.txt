Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP RI: Two upcoming meetings!
Message-ID: <CAHpuCEAUpNGL199+gnGzG=McPb2YbTh0YhUqDym_w5iB-Pq7Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Sorry we were so quiet all summer but I hope you enjoyed it. Now we can get
back to OWASP RI meetings. We have two great ones coming up, both by
attendees who volunteered to present.

Short info:

Sept 8, 6:30 pm, Advanced Persistent Legal Threats
Oct 13, 6:30 pm, Managing Apple in the Enterprise
Held at Upserve, 10 Dorrance St, Providence, RI

Longer info:

First is Thursday, September 8, Advanced Persistent Legal Threats by
William Gamble. William is an attorney and will discuss recent how changes
in the law (Federal regulations, civil law suits, state laws, insurance,
cloud contracts, international treaties) will impact the IT industry.
Essentially the economic impact, the risk profile of the law rather than a
discussion of the law itself.

Then on October 13, Adam Codega of Upserve will present Managing Apple in
the Enterprise. An environment where outliers were allowed to use Macs at
work unsupported by IT has turned into an environment where employees from
sales people to executives are requesting Macs and iOS devices, and saving
the company money at the same time. But, how are you managing these devices?

Please RSVP here:

These meetings will be held at the same location as always, Upserve, 10
Torrance Street in Providence.

See you there!

Patrick Laverty
OWASP Chapter Leader
