<PRE>Hi All:

the last meeting.

Thank you,

Hi All:

We&#8217;d like to extend some professional discounts to the folks at OWASP for
the upcoming SOURCE Boston conference and trainings.

The SOURCE Conference, Boston&#8217;s premier Information Security conference,
specializes in bringing business, technology and security professionals
together to discuss practical solutions to real-world problems. Established
in 2008, the SOURCE Conference provides a unique environment for learning,
networking, and exchanging ideas and solutions for today&#8217;s information
security challenges.

*World-class Agenda*
SOURCE gets some of the best speakers in the world, and this year is no
exception. You would normally need to get on a plane and fly to San
Francisco or Las Vegas to get the quality of talks you will find every year
at SOURCE Boston.

Jim Routh, CISO Aetna
Mike Murray, Director, Cyber Security Assessment and Consulting, GE

Countermeasures, FDA

We also have an excellent selection of speakers lined up, so we hope to see
you there. The main conference is being held on May 27-28th, and our
complete list of speakers and topics can be found at:
