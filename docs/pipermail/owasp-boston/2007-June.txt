Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston no meeting July, August
Message-ID: <80C01FD80BFB6C42BC2C52E553444DB4B4A876@nedexmb3.staplesams.com>

Hi Folks,
Since July 4 is our normal meeting date for July, we won't be meeting then.
August usually has sparse attendance due to vacations so I will skip August
as we did last year and as most user groups do. See you in September.
