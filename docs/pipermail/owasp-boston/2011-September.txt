Adriel Desautels -  Differences between Web Application Penetration
Testing and Vulnerability Scanning

 

Adriel T. Desautels is the President and CTO of Netragard, LLC. Among
other things Adriel specializes in the delivery of advanced, high-threat
anti-hacking services and covert network penetration methodologies.
Prior to founding Netragard Adriel founded the internationally
recognized SNOsoft Research Team, which quickly became the think tank
for Secure Network Operations, Inc. Today SNOsoft is owned and operated
by Netragard LLC. 

Adriel also has extensive experience and expertise in the design and
deployment of sophisticated Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention
(IDS/IPS) systems. In early 2002 Adriel designed an IDS/IPS technology
with powerful event correlation capabilities capable of accurately
identifying real events buried in a high volume of noise. That
technology was later acquired by a private third party. As a result of
his expertise Adriel has acted as an expert witness in U.S. Federal
Court.

Today Adriel's responsibilities at Netragard include but are not limited
to the design and management of all of Netragard's professional
services. Adriel's secondary responsibility is to run and maintain
Netragard's Exploit Acquisition Program (EAP). EAP is designed to
acquire bleeding edge, high value research and intelligence from the
hacking community

 

 

Wed. Sept 14, Jobspring offices, 545 Boyleston St. 6th floor,  Boston

Dinis Cruz

OWASP O2 Platform
Dinis Cruz

The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge
and workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough source
code-driven application security reviews (blackbox + whitebox). In
addition to the manual findings created/discovered by security
consultants, the OWASP O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of
results from multiple OWASP projects and commercial scanning tools. This
allows security consultants to find, exploit and automate (via Unit
Tests) security vulnerabilities usually dismissed by the community as
impossible to find/recreate. More importantly, it provides security
consultants a mechanism to: (a) "talk" with developers (via UnitTest),
(b) give developers a way to replicate + "check if it's fixed" the
vulnerabilities reported and (c) engage in a two-way conversion on the
best way to fix/remediate those vulnerabilities. For more details

Bio
Dinis Cruz is a Security Consultant based in London (UK) and specialized
in: ASP.NET/J2EE Application Security, Application Security audits and
.NET Security Curriculum Development.
For the past couple years Dinis has focused on the field of Static
Source Code Analysis and Dynamic Website Assessments (aka penetration
testing), and is the main developer of the OWASP O2 Platform which is an
Open Source project that is focused on 'Automating Security Consultants
Knowledge/Workflows' and 'Allowing non-security experts to access and
consume Security Knowledge'. Dinis is currently focused on making the O2
Platform the industry standard for consuming, instrumenting and
data-sharing between: the multiple WebAppSec tools, the Security
consultants and the final users (from management to developers).

Hi,
I would like to attend the meetings, but I'm a student at MIT without a car.
If anyone is driving from Cambridge, may I get a ride?
Thanks.

	We'll be having 2 meetings this month -
	
	
	
	Wed. Sept 7 at MS Waltham  6:30
	
	Adriel Desautels -  Differences between Web Application Penetration
	Testing and Vulnerability Scanning
	
	
	
	Adriel T. Desautels is the President and CTO of Netragard, LLC. Among
	other things Adriel specializes in the delivery of advanced, high-threat
	anti-hacking services and covert network penetration methodologies.
	Prior to founding Netragard Adriel founded the internationally
	recognized SNOsoft Research Team, which quickly became the think tank
	for Secure Network Operations, Inc. Today SNOsoft is owned and operated
	by Netragard LLC.
	
	Adriel also has extensive experience and expertise in the design and
	deployment of sophisticated Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention
	(IDS/IPS) systems. In early 2002 Adriel designed an IDS/IPS technology
	with powerful event correlation capabilities capable of accurately
	identifying real events buried in a high volume of noise. That
	technology was later acquired by a private third party. As a result of
	his expertise Adriel has acted as an expert witness in U.S. Federal
	Court.
	
	Today Adriel's responsibilities at Netragard include but are not limited
	to the design and management of all of Netragard's professional
	services. Adriel's secondary responsibility is to run and maintain
	Netragard's Exploit Acquisition Program (EAP). EAP is designed to
	acquire bleeding edge, high value research and intelligence from the
	hacking community

	OWASP O2 Platform
	Dinis Cruz
	
	The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge
	and workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security
	consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough source
	code-driven application security reviews (blackbox + whitebox). In
	addition to the manual findings created/discovered by security
	consultants, the OWASP O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of
	results from multiple OWASP projects and commercial scanning tools. This
	allows security consultants to find, exploit and automate (via Unit
	Tests) security vulnerabilities usually dismissed by the community as
	impossible to find/recreate. More importantly, it provides security
	consultants a mechanism to: (a) "talk" with developers (via UnitTest),
	(b) give developers a way to replicate + "check if it's fixed" the
	vulnerabilities reported and (c) engage in a two-way conversion on the
	best way to fix/remediate those vulnerabilities. For more details

	Hi,
