Hi all,

Just a reminder that our meeting with Congressman Langevin is tonight, and
it is at his headquarters in Warwick. The seating is limited, so we do
require an RSVP through the Meetup site. If you did RSVP and you cannot
make it, please change your response to "No", as we do have a waitlist.

Details are below, and we'll see you tonight!

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston Metro West meeting May 21
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKnmi4tsw1h82JMg=sdsXPbwRRDfpowNE41fq+prvevJhA@mail.gmail.com>

In order for OWASP Boston to better serve the metrowest Boston application
security community, we'll be having some meetings at Constant Contact,
Reservoir Place, 1601 Trapelo Road   Waltham, MA 02451

The first meeting will be Thursday May 21, 7 to 8:30 pm, in the Constant
Contact Innovation Center. This will be an informal meet and greet meeting,
no formal presentations, just talking about application security topics,
what OWASP has to offer, and how future meetings can be useful.  Constant
Contact will provide beer, snacks and soda. If you have any topic
suggestions let us/me know and we'll try to schedule something in the
future or talk about them on Thursday.

One topic I'll use to start conversations is what tools are people using
and not using - source code scan, web application firewall, web application
vulnerability scanner, threat intelligence service etc.

Directions -
Right off of Rt 128 in Waltham Ma, you should exit onto Trapelo Road and
take a right into Reservoir place.  Continue around to the front of the
building.

Park in the front of the building and enter in the main building lobby,
continue down the hallway and you will see the innovation center, enter in
the large glass doors

Dear Hackers and Security Gurus,

hardwear is seeking innovative research on hardware security. If you
have done interesting research on attacks or mitigation on any
Hardware and want to showcase it to the security community, just
submit your research paper. Please find all the relevant details for
the submission below.

About hardwear.io
----------------------------
Somewhere in the mid of last year, amidst all the news and concerns
surrounding trust and backdoors in hardware equipment, Hardwear was
conceptualized to provide the IT and security community with a
platform to discuss and solve issues pertaining to hardware security.
The objective of the conference revolves around four key concerns in
hardware, firmware and related protocols i.e. backdoors, exploits,
trust and attacks (BETA).

Dates:
Training: 29th - 39th Sept 2015
Conference: 1-2nd Oct 2015

Venue:
The Hague, Netherlands

General Queries: antriksh at hardwear.io

hardwear accepts papers on any topic that discusses in-depth hardware
and firmware security both from the offensive as well as defensive
perspective. Some of the topics of interest include (but not limited
to):

1. New Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? is a deep knowledge technical track
that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased before, it will fall under current research
category even though there are enhancements/changes to the original
research.

2. Current Research (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Submission Format

or magazine(s)?
Yes, No.
If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the previous

Yes/No.
(If Yes, how many? Also please explain each demo)

Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

Paper Abstract ? Please provide detailed working or your
research/work. The more details you provide the better it is for the
reviewers. Please keep the abstract to the point. Please do not try to
hide the technical details or say ?I can?t disclose it till bla bla?
as it does not help the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a
low score because of insufficient information available in the
abstract.
Your high resolution photo (attached)
Note
-------------------------
Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected. The Abstract should
clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail and merely
