OWASP Boston board members would like to welcome and congratulate *Jeremiah
Salamon* and *O'Shea Bowens* as our new chapter volunteers. Both Jeremiah
and O'Shea are active members of the Boston information security community
and we are very excited to have them join our chapter and help us organize
more application security focused events.
