6:30 - 7 - news review, risk analysis of Poodle,

The most popular presentation of BASC 2014  -
7  - How a Hacker Views Your Web Site
Presented by: Patrick Laverty<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2014_BASC_Speakers#Patrick_Laverty>

As defenders, we have to be right 100% of the time where an attacker only needs to be right once. The attack surface of a modern web site is incredibly large and we need to be aware of all of it. Additionally, individual attacks may not always be effective but sometimes using them together can gain the desired effect. In this talk, we'll take a look at the whole attack surface for a typical web site and the various ways that an attacker will use to compromise a site.

Hi all and happy new year! OWASP RI is back with our meetings again after a
restful December. I just wanted to let you know about the upcoming meetings
and a switch that we made. We flipped the January and February speakers, so
on January 21, we will have David Sherry, CISO at Brown University talking
about the Maturing Security Model and on February 18, we will have Prof.
Vic Fay-Wolfe talking about Forensics. Our full upcoming schedule is below,
along with the links to meetup.com where you can RSVP your attendance.

I also wanted to let people know that the OWASP Boston meeting is this
week, Wednesday night at 6:30 pm at Akamai in Cambridge (150 Broadway,
formerly 8 Cambridge Center). Jim Weiler will be talking risk analysis for
POODLE and I will be presenting on how a hacker views your web site. And
like us in RI, the Boston chapter also has pizza and drinks available, so
come on by! (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston)
