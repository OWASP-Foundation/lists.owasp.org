Subject: [Owasp-boston] AppSec USA Discount
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKnXn8=OKW1CSDtoHTdojdHbvFATJDWMNZ0+wgVXgjh90g@mail.gmail.com>

The AppSecUSA Conference team would like to provide all OWASP chapters with
a discount to the conference and the chance to earn free tickets to the
event.


You can use the following coupon code - US2015_BO -  to get $100 off the
ticket price for AppSec USA when you register. You can use this code
whether or not you are an official OWASP dues paying member.


For every 5 paid OWASP members that use our chapter coupon code the chapter
will receive 1 free conference admission. This conference admission will be
raffled off to someone in the chapter. You do not have to be a paid OWASP
member to be in the raffle for any free AppSec ticket.  If you have already
paid for AppSec and you are the winner of the free ticket raffle you can
still use the free ticket to get a refund on your admission.



- Individuals that sign up for AppSec with the discount coupon that aren't
paid OWASP members will not be counted towards the 5/1 free ticket program.



- This discount is valid for June and July to encourage early registrations!


If you decide to become an OWASP member,  which you can do when you
register for AppSec, please remember to choose 'Boston' as your chapter
allocation. The Boston chapter gets %40 of each membership that indicates
'Boston'.

Subject: [Owasp-boston] July 8 meeting - Cambridge
Message-ID: <CAKEaLKkw2ZP5FAqtcc0ZwrSs6LJLAr8m=8jsqMuQyLr+tNYK6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,
This will be a open discussion meeting. We had a great time with lots of
discussion at the first MetroWest meeting so we're going to try one in
Cambridge.

Let us know if there's a topic you'd like to hear/talk about - no
presentations, just one topic for a while, then another topic etc. You can
introduce a topic and your thoughts if you want. A great way to learn what
other people are doing and why.

2 topics so far:
1. Do people do source code scanning, web application firewall and web
application vulnerability (run time black box) scanning
2. talking risk to developers, business, management.

Any other topics?
