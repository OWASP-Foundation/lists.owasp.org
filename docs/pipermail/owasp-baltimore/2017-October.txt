Hey, all! Sorry for the delay in sending this note. We had a little problem
with the mailing list.



We?ve scheduled a meeting in two weeks: Tuesday, 10/17! Dave Wichers is
going to update us on the OWASP Benchmark Project, a test suite that
evaluates the speed, coverage, and accuracy of automated vulnerability
detection tools and services. How awesome is that? RSVP here:
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Baltimore-Chapter/events/243529598/.
TEKsystems is providing the location and sponsoring food. Ten people have
registered so far.



In other news, unfortunately, we have been unable to acquire control of the
chapter?s Twitter account and LinkedIn group. Our attempts at hacking them
have failed. L We may create new ?official? social channels at some point.


Your OWASP Chapter leaders

Good Evening,


Friendly reminder that we all look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow
for our first regional OWASP meeting for quite some time. Dust off the
cobwebs and come get your App-Sec on with Dave Wichers, Chaim, Ann and
I. We look forward to a collaborative and informative event. If you have
a topic of expertise, please drop us a line and we will be sure to get
you in for a speaking spot at future events.

Quick thank you to everyone that came out and made our first event in
years, a success. Dave gave us an energetic and enthusiastic presentation
on the owasp benchmark tool. We are always looking for speakers for future
events so please drop us a line if you have something to share. We could
even split preso?s/topics. Ann, Chaim and I are looking forward
to the November social! See you all in a few weeks!

Best wishes!

B?More OWASP team
