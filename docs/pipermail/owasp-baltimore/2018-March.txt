I have deep experience with ZAP and have used Burp in the past, but not in
a while. I definitely think this would be a good topic and am happy to help
demo some of the ZAP stuff, if there is a need.  We haven't met in a while
so its time to set something up!!

Awesome.  I'd like to see that topic at the next Meetup.

Also, we are coming across web application development activities that I
would like to share with some new partners.
My business is more IV&V during the SDLC, so a partner could benefit us
greatly.  Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,
Shawn

Hi All,

It sounds like we have a topic and speakers (Dave and Shawn). Are there
any times in late March that you aren't available? I was thinking any
night the week of the 27th.

Thanks,

Brad

walk away with a clear understanding of the differences between the two
tools and when to use each.

*Where*
TEK Systems
999 Corporate Blvd Ste 200

Hey All,

Though this isn't really OWASP-related, I thought this topic would
interest a few people. On the 29th of March, I will be giving a
presentation on writing FreeBSD malware. Anyone is welcome to attend.
Here's the Meetup page:
