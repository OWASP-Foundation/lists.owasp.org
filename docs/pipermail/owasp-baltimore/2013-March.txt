Hi All,

Is anything going on in Baltimore worth talking about? A first
meeting? Questions? Answers?

Jeff

Hey Jeff,

Our first meeting will be 6pm April 4th at the Sourcefire headquarters in
Columbia. The address is 9790 Patuxent Woods Dr, Suite 200. I'll have signs
posted. The doors will be locked, so I will be letting everyone in. We
currently have around 15-20 confirmed guests. We'll be filling one
conference room completely with 20 people, so I believe 20 should be our
limit.

This meeting will just be an informal meet & greet along with a quick
presentation about what OWASP is, its projects, the people involved. I'll
be the one wearing yellow-tinted glasses.

If you can make it, I'm excited to meet you.

Thanks,

Shawn Webb
