*What's Hiding in Your Software Components?  Hidden Risks of
Component-Based Software*



*WHAT*

Software is no longer written, it's assembled. With 80% of a typical
application now being assembled from components, it's time to take a hard
look at the new risks posed by this type of development -- and the
processes and tools that we'll need in order to keep them in check.



On the just released OWASP Top 10 for 2013, entry A9 highlights the
potential problems associated with the widespread use of open-source
components with known security vulnerabilities in modern-day application
development.

Join Ryan Berg, Sonatype CSO, as he shares real world data on component
risks, outlines the scope of the problem, and proposes approaches for
managing these risk. You'll learn how security professionals can work
cooperatively with application developers to reduce risk AND boost
developer efficiency.



*Ryan's Bio:*


Ryan is the Chief Security Officer at Sonatype. Before joining Sonatype,
Ryan was a co-founder and chief scientist for Ounce Labs which was acquired
by IBM in 2009. Ryan holds multiple patents and is a popular speaker,
instructor and author, in the fields of security, risk management, and
secure application development.


*Snacks and beverages will be provided.*
