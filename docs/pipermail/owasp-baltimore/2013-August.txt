Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] August Meeting Cancelled
Message-ID: <CAH4MPwHhe+zKQ0oFnguUXSp_G85Dug2ptZGX6igOPgMZyhj=nA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Apologies for sending this out late. We had a poll set up on Meetup for
about 3 weeks now, and haven't seen much of a response via any of the usual
suspects -- Twitter, LinkedIn & Meetup. We took this to mean that a lot of
folks were/are still on a post-DEFCON/BlackHat hangover. The August meeting
that was due to be held today (2nd Thursday) has therefore been cancelled.

*We will still be having the September meeting on schedule (1st Thursday -
Sept 5)*. Hopefully this meeting will get our calendar back on track. If
anyone wants to present, our calendar is WIDE open. Please contact either
Shawn Webb or myself, and we can co-ordinate the meeting, and send out
invites.

Hi Jeff,

Very sorry to reply this late. I was caught up with some personal stuff
this week, and couldn?t find the time to send out a cancellation notice.
>From what we noticed on the poll we set up, we had 2 responses (including
one from myself), which led us to believe that our members had other stuff
going on. Shawn and I discussed it, and we figured a cancellation would be
best.

I take responsibility for not sending this out sooner, and will do my best
to make sure the communication is more prompt going forward.


-Rajiv

No problem.

Yeah, summer time, kids, and vacations. A lot of places shut down over
the summer months.

See you in September.
