Hey everyone!

Happy New Year! We are excited about a presentation hosted by our friends
at TEKsystems later this month. On 1/29, Robert Wood, CSO at Simon Data,
will be talking about social engineering and how to better scale associated
testing and remediation.

https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Balt/events/257938546/

We look forward to seeing you there! And if you have a topic idea for a
future meeting, we're listening.

Ann, Brad, and Chaim

Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] Meeting tomorrow night - social engineering
Message-ID: <CAC9XAOtJz0YYVNX9WSjdkhkFdARgWj_7qHE4aW_rv+fwkCpD+A@mail.gmail.com>

Tomorrow night (weather permitting), Robert Wood, CSO at Simon Data, will
be talking about social engineering and how to better scale associated
testing and remediation. *20+ of us have already signed up!*
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Balt/events/257938546/

*If we get messy weather, **we will reschedule the meeting by 1 pm
tomorrow.* It looks like we will be fine, but we will send out an email
tomorrow confirming or rescheduling (either way), so no one needs to
wonder. If you don't receive an email from me, check the Meetup page above.

Looking forward to seeing you!
Ann, Brad, and Chaim
