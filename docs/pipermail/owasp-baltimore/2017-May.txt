I wouldn't be at all opposed to something on the west side, say near Catonsville. That's my preference but anything not far on the east (like Dundalk or White Marsh) I should be able to do.

I thought we had a new venue around the BWI area.  I think we should also
get a couple of speakers.  Maybe something regarding OWASP projects or
tools as in an update presentation.
I've not yet been to an OWASP meet-up so I would say I am somewhat
unqualified to put the first one together.  But perhaps I can help if
someone wants to drive the "revival" one.
