<PRE>Hi everyone,

For a number of reasons, chief among them being that we have no speaker
lined up for tonight, we're forced to cancel this month's meetup. Sorry for
the late notice, we were hoping someone would be ready to step up and
present at the meeting.

Please let us know what you think can be improved with the running of this
chapter. We would appreciate more of you putting your hand up and
volunteering to present at meetings. It would make *our* job easier with
scheduling meetings, and it'll simultaneously give *you* good exposure to
present exciting new research you're working on, a paper for a security
conference, or any topic you're passionate about.

This chapter can only grow with your continued participation and interest.
When polls or mailers are sent out on the Meetup and/or OWASP mailing
lists, please try and respond to them, so we can ensure a topic of interest
to you as an attendee. It can be just a short reply, or however long you'd
like. It would help us plan ahead, rather than be left in the awkward
position of having to cancel a meeting for which a handful of people have
already RSVPed.

I guess what we're trying to say is this: As of now, we have just two of us
from the chapter leadership, working on setting up meetings, arranging
speakers and figuring out snacks and logistics. The group seems to come
alive and buzzing with activity the day before and after meetings, but
shows no engagement otherwise. If you do feel that Meetup as a social
engagement platform isn't really working out, or you'd like to see more
interaction and buzz on this page, we want to hear from you. If you have
ideas on how we can make Baltimore OWASP a sustainable initiative, rather
than just a disappearing act that lasted all of 6 months, then it's up to
all of us to make it work.

For starters, if you'd like to be involved in the running of this chapter,
or getting involved in scouting locations, sponsor and/or speakers, we
could really use your help. We'd like to hear from you. Please reach out to
Shawn Webb or Rajiv Mathew with your thoughts.


Regards,
Baltimore OWASP
