Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] October meetup: Risks Hiding in Plain Site
Message-ID: <CAC9XAOtr_rMo_7k4Rv9kj+pNschDXLBz7=W65Q6qPBuoCKn9Vw@mail.gmail.com>

In brief: In a recent study, NowSecure found that 85% of mobile apps have
one or more vulns that violate the OWASP Mobile Top 10. At our 10/2
meeting, Brian Reed, Chief Mobility Officer from NowSecure, will review the
OWASP Mobile Top 10 framework and present this eye popping benchmark data.
