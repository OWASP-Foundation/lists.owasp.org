I feel like a new meetup is long overdue. 
Are there any dates setup? 
What is present interest at? Anything new that should be covered?

Tony,

What does your question mean? Are you looking for OWASP community members
to volunteer time doing development on some OWASP project? i.e. What 'our
projects' are you refering to? and what do you mean by 'Owasp developers'?

I run an OWASP project and am always looking for developer volunteers to
work on it. :-)  I'm refering to the OWASP Benchmark Project.

-Dave

I'd be happy to present on the OWASP Benchmark Project:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Benchmark. We launched this effort two
years ago and have been working on it steadily ever since.

I could also present on the new OWASP Top 10 - 2017, which we are about to
release in the next few weeks. This is the Release Candidate for public
comment. Final will be produced in the Fall based on feedback received.

I lead both of these OWASP projects.  Any clue how many people might be
interested in attending a local area OWASP meeting? And where are they
typically held? In Baltimore, in the suburbs? I actually haven't been to a
local OWASP meeting in years ... :-(

Hi, Dave! Both of those topics interest me. I can?t answer your questions about past events, but I am an hour above Baltimore, so personally would be enthusiastic about anything on the north side, such as Cockeysville.

I notice that the Washington DC OWASP Chapter has 736 members in their Meetup.com group. I would be happy to start a Meetup group for Baltimore, if someone can authorize that. Even if we aren?t ready to plan an event, we can start accumulating interested non-members.

It?s on my 2017 personal goals to volunteer more in security circles, so ? I would be happy to organize an event or help someone else plan. ?

Best Regards,

Ann Grove, CIPP/US

I'd contact the OWASP staff about any procedures for establishing a new
chapter. Hopefully there are pages on the OWASP wiki about how to do
that.:-)  I used to run the Baltimore chapter over 10 years ago and it has
sporadically tried to restart once or twice since then but no luck (It
takes a decent amount of work)!!  But I'd love for someone to do so and I'd
be happy to give talks and attend periodically.

The DC and N. VA OWASP Chapters are both thriving, probably because they
are both bigger areas AND more importantly have strong volunteer leadership
willing to put in the time to make them thrive.

I am certainly interested in a new meetup.
I'll help contribute if that will help make one happen.

Hi Dave,

I've been emailing with Michael H. about reviving this Charter.  I will be
looking for a new meeting area depending on what we can work out.

Thanks,
Shawn
