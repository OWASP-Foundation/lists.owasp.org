Hot off the press -- Jeff Williams (CEO, Aspect Security & former volunteer
Chair of OWASP) will be presenting the talk he delivered at the OWASP
AppSec USA Conference in New York just 2 weeks ago.



*ABSTRACT*From (
https://owasp.confex.com/owasp/appsecusa13/webprogram/Session1435.html)

Software development is moving much faster than application security with
new platforms, languages, frameworks, paradigms, and methodologies like
Agile and Devops.

Unfortunately, software assurance hasn't kept up with the times. For the
most part, our security techniques were built to work with the way software
was built in 2002. Here are some of the technologies and practices that
today?s best software assurance techniques **can?t**handle: JavaScript,
Ajax, inversion of control, aspect-oriented programming, frameworks,
libraries, SOAP, REST, web services, XML, JSON, raw sockets, HTML5, Agile,
DevOps, WebSocket, Cloud, and more. All of these rest pretty much at the
core of modern software development.

Although we?re making progress in application security, the gains are much
slower than the stunning advances in software development. After 10 years
of getting further behind every day, software *assurance *is now largely
incompatible with modern software *development*. It?s not just security
tools ? application security processes are largely incompatible as well.
And the result is that security has very little influence on the software
trajectory at all.

Unless the application security community figures out how to be a relevant
part of software development, we will continue to lag behind and effect
minimal change. In this talk, Jeff will explore a radically different
approach based on instrumenting an entire IT organization with passive
sensors to collect real-time data that can be used to identify
vulnerabilities, enhance security architecture, and (most importantly)
enable application security to generate value.

*The goal is unprecedented real-time visibility into application security
across an organization's entire application portfolio, allowing all the
stakeholders in security to collaborate and finally become proactive. *
