Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] OWASP Testing Topics?
Message-ID: <CAJydNgGnXKW0_yC2v_VYw+y6XEWT+ad7JnZH-D332KYZtSbhwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Just looking for an interest level:

Would the group be interested in seeing some of the OWASP tools used for
web application testing?

Perhaps some of the feature of ZAP, OWTF, or maybe just open-source tools?
What about understanding some of the vulnerabilities associated with web
applications that are different that normal network traffic vulnerabilities
such as XSS, SQL injection, or LFI/RFI?

Thanks,
Shawn

Would it be too much to ask to leverage Burp? Burp is free to use, and very cheap to license for pro use. I?d be hard pressed to find a web developer who couldn?t shell out the money for it at least once in their career. I believe It?s also Jython based, which gives one the option to develop plugins in java or python as I recall. Understandably not open source, but many of the things it can do are not so complex that they couldn?t be ported to an open source project, if truly desired. I guess what I?m trying to state is that while being a nice tool, it?s low enough to the ground that you don?t really get the feeling the tool is doing all the work for you.
