Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] Bernstein Talk on Cryptography Failures
Message-ID: <CAH8yC8kD8d79-K0bJgj8=cXehYtL53W4jrrh9_ArBC72jSNDaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Jim Manico posted a link to an OWASP Podcast 95
(https://www.owasp.org/download/jmanico/owasp_podcast_95.mp3) on the
Secure Coding List (http://www.securecoding.org/list/).

At around 12:00 minutes, Dr. Bernstein talks about Bluecoat and
Trustwave's systematic modification and tampering of encrypted network
traffic. He used the examples as failures of cryptography.

Be sure to pin those certificates and public keys.

Jeff

Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] July Meeting - Pen-Testing Lab + CTF |
	Unallocated Space, Baltimore
Message-ID: <CADt0fhyyLRVZ=48P=HcZOyhvV-yQf5zYx6sHf7hTkB8OO-yODg@mail.gmail.com>

We will be holding a explanation of basic web pen testing followed by
a couple examples to try, at Unallocated Space in Baltimore. This will
be held on 11th July (the second Thursday instead of the first), to
take into account the 4th of July long weekend the week before.

We will be working through a couple of basic web application attacks
with examples.  We will finish by walking through the examples
step-by-step after participants have gotten the chance to try on their
own.  There will be additional examples for anyone that wishes to
attempt more challenges.
