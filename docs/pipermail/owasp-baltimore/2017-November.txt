Please join us at our upcoming Baltimore OWASP social, 6:30 pm Tuesday,
11/14, in Columbia, MD. Come for the free appetizers! Stay for the great
conversation. The chapter is co-hosting the event with F5, which you may
know for their work with app security and availability. https://www.

*Announcement: *Johns Hopkins University's Matthew Green, cryptography
professor, has agreed to speak to our chapter at a spring event. Details
are pending. We are collecting suggestions for specific cryptography
topics. Brad offered an idea to get us started: application layer
encryption. Green said we can get even more specific than that. Green on
Twitter: https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green?lang=en.  His blog:

Hope to see you soon,
Your chapter leaders (Ann, Brad, and Chaim)
