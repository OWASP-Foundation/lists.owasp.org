Hi, everyone!

Since our prior chapter leader has moved away from the Baltimore area, I have volunteered as a chapter leader. I haven?t quite figured out how to make that happen so please let me know if you have any advice. I?m going to try to contact the Philly chapter leader.

For now, I became the organizer for our chapter?s meetup by obtaining a paid membership. Otherwise, we would have lost the membership list for that group.

So once we get things worked out with OWASP, we?ll schedule some events!

Best Regards,

Thanks Ann for volunteering!! I was the chapter leader in the
Baltimore/Columbia area over a decade ago. But gave up as I was spending
too much time helping to run OWASP itself!!

I'm happy to volunteer to give talks. The challenge, to me anyway, was
gathering enough interested attendees. I think with social media now
(Meetups and such), it should be much easier. I also think holding joint
meetings with other IT/Security/Software groups is also a good idea. I.e.,
you approach an existing group with a good topic/speaker (me??) and they
might/should be happy to hold a joint meeting with OWASP.

Sounds good, Dave! I?ve been a chapter president for another organization, so I know how draining that can be. So thank you for your efforts.

I too think we can leverage social media to build our community once we gain access to those accounts. And cosponsored meetings sound great, as long as there isn?t an OWASP guideline against that sort of thing. We?ll figure it out!

Hi Linda,

I think Ass is interested in keeping the Meetup part of Baltimore's OWASP

FYI - I created a chapter Twitter account: https://twitter.com/OWASPBalt

I am still trying to get support from OWASP and gain access to our LinkedIn group and any other social channels.

OWASP recommends having at least two leaders, in case I get hit in the head with a golf ball I suppose, so I?m looking for a couple of partners in crime. We have received offers of help for speakers, locations, and potentially sponsors, so it?s going to be a blast. Let me know of your interest.

Please note, all emails sent to this list are publicly visible (including the email address of the sender): http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-baltimore.

Best Regards,

Ann

If anyone has a telephone number for Matt Morris or a password for the chapter?s gmail account, please let me know. (I sent Matt a note to a LIVE.com email address, but no response yet.) Some of our social accounts are set up with a chapter gmail address and without email access, we can?t reclaim them. OWASP can, but the process may take months.

Some good news:

-          Chaim Sanders and Brad Scherer have joined me as your chapter leaders and I updated the leader information on our chapter?s wiki page. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Baltimore. We will work on putting together a meeting.

-          I learned that our chapter has more than $5,000, so we don?t have to ask OWASP for seed money.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11acTOmtmBGq6-5CIGsjlEByU8POSGqda0r23VNnhEGQ/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&hl=en_US&output=html.

All my best,

Ann | A Chapter Leader

I think I found him on linkedin. https://www.linkedin.com/in/infosecmatt

I sent a friend request and a note that we are trying to reach out to him.
