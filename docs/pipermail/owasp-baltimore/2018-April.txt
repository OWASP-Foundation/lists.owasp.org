A respected cryptographer and security technologist, Dr. Matthew Green led
the research team that exposed flaws in more than a third of SSL/TLS
encrypted web sites. This team also found vulnerabilities in other
encryption technologies, including RSA BSafe, Exxon/Mobil Speedpass,
EZpass, and automotive security systems. In addition, Dr. Green led the
team that developed the first anonymous cryptocurrencies, Zerocoin and
Zerocash.

Dr. Green, with more than fifteen years of computer security experience, is
an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins Information
Security Institute. He specializes in applied cryptography,
privacy-enhanced storage systems, and anonymous cryptocurrencies. Dr. Green
writes the Blog "A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering" and is the
author of more than fifty academic publications. His work has been widely
cited by media including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes,
Reuters, Wired, Washington Post, and The Economist.

He is a member of the technical advisory board for the Linux Foundation
Core Infrastructure Initiative, formed to address critical Internet
security concerns in the wake of Heartbleed, and he spoke about
cryptography in the wake of Heartbleed as a keynote speaker at AppSecUSA
2016, an OWASP conference. Dr. Green also co-founded the Open Crypto Audit
Project and he serves on its Board of Directors.
