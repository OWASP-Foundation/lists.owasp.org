*TOPIC*
>From the OWASP project page:
The primary aim of the *OWASP Application Security Verification Standard
(ASVS) Project* is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of
rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web application
security verification using a commercially-workable open standard. The
standard provides a basis for testing application technical security
controls, as well as any technical security controls in the environment,
that are relied on to protect against vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. This standard can be used to establish a
level of confidence in the security of Web applications. "

Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] Null Byte Injection in filenames fixed in Java 7
	too!
Message-ID: <024301ceb0e1$0d4e0470$27ea0d50$@owasp.org>

For those of you who attended the chapter meeting last week, I mentioned
that Null Byte Injection into filenames in Java was being fixed in Java 1.8.

 

Turns out that it was also just fixed in Java 7 update 40 which just came
out.  Details are here:
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8014846

 

So, if you or your customers are using Java 7, I would recommend you upgrade
to update 40 as soon as you can.

 

-Dave
