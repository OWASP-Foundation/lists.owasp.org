Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] October OWASP Meeting: Effectiveness of Automated
	Vuln Detection
Message-ID: <CY4PR04MB0727E117CF63A5B957F5BF05CB610@CY4PR04MB0727.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hey, all!

We?ve scheduled an October meeting! Dave Wichers is going to update us on the OWASP Benchmark Project, a test suite that evaluates the speed, coverage, and accuracy of automated vulnerability detection tools and services. How awesome is that? RSVP here: https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Baltimore-Chapter/events/243529598/. TEKsystems is providing the location and sponsoring food.

If you are interested in hosting, sponsoring, or speaking at a future event, please let us know via email (me and your other chapter leaders, Chaim and Brad who are on cc:). I do have the emails some of you sent when we started the chapter?s transition to new leadership, but if you want to reiterate your interest to the leadership team, feel free.

In other news, unfortunately, we have been unable to acquire control of the chapter?s Twitter account and LinkedIn group. Our attempts at hacking them have failed. ? We may create new ?official? social channels at some point.

Best Regards,

Ann Grove, on behalf of your chapter leaders
