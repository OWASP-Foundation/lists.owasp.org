Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] [REMINDER] Tomorrow,
	Nov 7th at 6:00PM - OWASP BWA & ZAP
Message-ID: <CAH4MPwFZmCMNq_uOf7Rqc9XDN=fJa3MY_CpsBaAaB6boCrDP9w@mail.gmail.com>

*Tomorrow's November meeting of the OWASP Baltimore chapter will be held
at:*

*Unallocated Space*<http://maps.google.com/maps?q=512+Shaw+Court+Unit+105%2C+Severn%2C+MD>

*512 Shaw Court Unit 105, Severn, MD*

This interactive session will provide an introduction to two OWASP Projects:

? *Broken Web Application (BWA)* project, which releases a free virtual
machine running web applications with known security vulnerabilities.
? *Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)* project, which produces a free tool for testing
web applications.

The goal of the session is to get attendees started working with these
projects and comfortable to continue using them for self-study if desired.
The OWASP BWA VM includes a variety of training applications that are well
suited for people at a variety of skill levels.

In order to get the most from this session, attendees should bring a laptop
with the following items downloaded / installed:

- OWASP ZAP (http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/downloads/list), which
requires a Java runtime
- A virtualization package, such as the free VirtualBox, free VMware
Player, or commercial VMware Workstation
- The OWASP BWA VM (http://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/ or via
BitTorrent at
http://code.google.com/p/owaspbwa/wiki/OWASPBWABitTorrentDownload).

*NOTE - Please uncompress the VM before the session to save time.*

Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] Calling on speakers for Dec 5th Meeting
Message-ID: <CAH4MPwHAXJtAprr9_a0yEbocDMQw8TU2cQXYiSVNM-66MOg_cw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

We do not have any speaker lined up yet for the December meeting. If you
would like to present, please contact me at rajiv.t.mathew at gmail.com, or
260-307-2548, so we can set something up. You don't necessarily have to
deliver a formal powerpoint-style session, a hands-on demo or interactive
session would also work.

Hope to hear from one (or more) of you soon.

Regards,
Rajiv
