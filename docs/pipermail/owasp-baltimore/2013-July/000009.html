<PRE>We will be holding a explanation of basic web pen testing followed by
a couple examples to try, at Unallocated Space in Baltimore. This will
be held on 11th July (the second Thursday instead of the first), to
take into account the 4th of July long weekend the week before.

We will be working through a couple of basic web application attacks
with examples.  We will finish by walking through the examples
step-by-step after participants have gotten the chance to try on their
own.  There will be additional examples for anyone that wishes to
attempt more challenges.
