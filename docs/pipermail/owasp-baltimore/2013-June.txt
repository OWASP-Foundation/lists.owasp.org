Access to the main building door at the Aspect Security office location (9175 Guilford Road), might be restricted after 6PM or 7PM, I forget which one. If you're downstairs and are unable to enter the building, call me on 260-307-2548<tel:260-307-2548>, and I should be able to come downstairs to let you in.

If you are able to enter the building, hit 3 on the elevator. You will see the office on the left, as you step out onto the 3rd floor.

Regards,
Rajiv

Subject: [Owasp-baltimore] July Meeting - Pen-Testing Lab + CTF |
	Unallocated Space, Baltimore
Message-ID: <CAEH9_s8QjxDFLxbyQuaac28CTjodpf2OHXgpTjXOdq+beGwTtg@mail.gmail.com>

We will be holding a explanation of basic web pen testing followed by a
couple examples to try, at *Unallocated Space in Baltimore*. This will be
held *on 11th July* (the second Thursday instead of the first), to take
into account the 4th of July long weekend the week before.

We will be working through a couple of basic web application attacks with
examples.  We will finish by walking through the examples step-by-step
after participants have gotten the chance to try on their own.  There will
be additional examples for anyone that wishes to attempt more challenges.
