*DATE &amp; TIME
*September 5th, 6:00PM

**

*
LOCATION
**Zot Inc.
**6731 Columbia Gateway Drive Suite 110, Columbia, MD 21046*.

*This month's topic, by popular vote (and by that I mean, a couple of
votes) is* OWASP ASVS Project &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS</A>&gt;. We
can discuss other topics of interest if time permits.


*TOPIC*
&gt;<i>From the OWASP project page:
</I>The primary aim of the *OWASP Application Security Verification Standard
(ASVS) Project* is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of
rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web application
security verification using a commercially-workable open standard. The
standard provides a basis for testing application technical security
controls, as well as any technical security controls in the environment,
that are relied on to protect against vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. This standard can be used to establish a
level of confidence in the security of Web applications. &quot;

*SPEAKER
*Our speaker for September's meeting is Dave Wichers.

Dave Wichers is a cofounder and the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Aspect
Security &lt;<A HREF="http://www.aspectsecurity.com/">http://www.aspectsecurity.com/</A>&gt;, a company that specializes in
application security services. He is also a long time contributor to OWASP
including being a member of the OWASP Board since it was formed in 2003.

Dave has over 25 years of experience in the information security field, and
has focused exclusively on application security since 1998. At Aspect, in
addition to his COO duties, he is Aspect's application security courseware
lead, one of their chief instructors, and provides a wide variety of
application security consulting services to Aspect's clients. Prior to
starting Aspect, he ran the Application Security Services Group at Exodus
Communications. Dave has a Bachelors and Masters degree in Computer
Science, and is a CISSP.
