Hi All,

The updated slides and sample iOS program were uploaded. You can get
them from https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning.

Here's some more reading on some of the tangential subjects that were
brought up. All of it is available from Peter Gutmann's "Engineering
Security" (www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/book.pdf?) and Ross
Anderson's "Security Engineering"
(http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html).

Burpe Suite and Man-in-the-Middle attacks:
http://portswigger.net/burp/. It's offensive security (used by Pen
Testers), and would make a great talk if Greg were interested.

INTP and INTJ personalities (MBTI types), who are obsessive-compulsive
geeks, and 7% of the population: Gutmann's book, page 136.

Users and their psychology ("users do what users do", and why we need
to "defend, don't ask"): Gutmann's book, Chapter 2; and Anderson's
book, Chapter Chapter 2.

Usability: Gutmann's book, Chapter 5; and Anderson's book, Chapter Chapter 2.

Forgot to include the Iranian fellow who first blew the whistle on
what was going on in Iranian and Diginotar:

http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/gmail/share-and-discuss-with-others/3J3r2JqFNTw

...
Today, when I trid to login to my Gmail account I saw a certificate
warning in Chrome. I took a screenshot and I saved certificate to a
file.

this is the certificate file with screenshot in a zip file:
http://www.mediafire.com/?rrklb17slctityb

and this is text of decoded fake certificate: http://pastebin.com/ff7Yg663

when I used a vpn I didn't see any warning ! I think my ISP or my
government did this attack (because I live in Iran and you may hear
something about the story of Comodo hacker!)

What's Hiding in Your Software Components?  Hidden Risks of Component-Based Software


WHAT

Software is no longer written, it's assembled. With 80% of a typical application now being assembled from components, it's time to take a hard look at the new risks posed by this type of development -- and the processes and tools that we'll need in order to keep them in check.

On the just released OWASP Top 10 for 2013, entry A9 highlights the potential problems associated with the widespread use of open-source components with known security vulnerabilities in modern-day application development.

Join Ryan Berg, Sonatype CSO, as he shares real world data on component risks, outlines the scope of the problem, and proposes approaches for managing these risk. You'll learn how security professionals can work cooperatively with application developers to reduce risk AND boost developer efficiency.



Ryan's Bio:

Ryan is the Chief Security Officer at Sonatype. Before joining Sonatype, Ryan was a co-founder and chief scientist for Ounce Labs which was acquired by IBM in 2009. Ryan holds multiple patents and is a popular speaker, instructor and author, in the fields of security, risk management, and secure application development.



Snacks and beverages will be provided.
