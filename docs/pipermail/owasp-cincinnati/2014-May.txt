Hey Y?all,

I hope everyone is doing well. We have secured a speaker and sponsor for our June meeting. You can find details and register at our Eventbrite page. http://www.eventbrite.com/e/june-14-owasp-cincinnati-tickets-11740152111

Our speaker will be Anurag ?Archie? Agarwal of MyAppSecurity and he will be presenting on ?Building a Scalable Threat Modeling Practice in 7 Easy Steps?.  Archie has been here before a couple of years ago and was well received by the group. Let?s all welcome him back and support our Chapter. MyAppSecurity will be sponsoring lunch as well so you have no excuse. See y?all on Tuesday June 17, 2014 from 12:00 - 1:30 PM. The time and place are the same just please make sure that you register so we know how much food to have on hand.
