You will notice that we have changed venues for now. Due to Citi moving out of the Blue Ash office we had to find other meeting locations. We do not have a permanent home yet but are still working on it.

What: Cincinnati OWASP Meeting
When: Tuesday April, 12, 2016 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM
Where: Christ Hospital Auditorium?
? ? ? ? ? ??2139 Auburn Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45219
Who: Allison Shubert and Andy Willingham
Topic: OWASP 101 - It's been a while since we've taken a good look at what
? ? ? ? ? OWASP can do for you so we are going to highlight some of the reasons
? ? ? ? ? that you should be involved and how OWASP can help you be a better
? ? ? ? ? security practitioner and/or software developer. Also we will discuss how?
? ? ? ? ? the OWASP Top 10 impacts your day to day life.

Since this is a new location it may take you a few minutes to find the auditorium. My contact there tells me that it is best to park in the Visitors Lot and enter the atrium on level A and follow the signs. I will be visiting the site next week to get a good feel for the location and will provide additional details if necessary.

We are planning on having Pizza so come hungry!

Regards,
