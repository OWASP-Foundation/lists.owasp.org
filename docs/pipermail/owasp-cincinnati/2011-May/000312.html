<PRE>Dear OWASP leaders

 

I have a meeting still scheduled for the 26th next week but I have not
received confirmation yet from the speaker. I should have it today. If not
we would need to move to June meetings.

Anyhow I received requests for CPE credit and attendance credits to previous
meetings. I will hope to provide this for you. If anybody needs CPE and
attendance participation can you please send me an email.

 

Also I would like to do a short meeting next week also but more like a forum
for the chapter sort of open discussion on what we can do to improve our
chapter attendance, organize conferences and active participation to support
the chapter and the other activities such as RSVP and web site.

 

With best regards

 

Marco Morana

 

</PRE>
