<PRE>Happy 2017! OK, so it's a little late in the year for that but this is our first communication of the year so I'm still allowed. Things have been quiet on the meeting front but underneath we've been paddling like ducks and are excited to announce our first meeting of the year and it's coming up quick. I apologize for the late notice but it has been an eventful year so far and I had a personal event that came out of the blue a couple of weeks ago caused a bit of a delay in this.

We will meet on Tuesday March 28, 2017 at the Paycor Building in Norwood. A big thanks to Paycor for offering to host us for our first meeting of the year. We are doing a &quot;Mixed bag&quot; for a presentation as Allison Schubert will give a quick RSA update and then we will be discussing the concept of SecDevOps. As usual if you don't want to come for the talks then come for the networking and food as we will be providing Pizza and Drinks again.

The address for the Paycor Office is 4811 Montgomery Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45212. You will need to check in at the security desk prior to being admitted to the meeting.

Please register if you plan to attend so we can know how many we need to feed. You can register on our Eventbrite page here.
