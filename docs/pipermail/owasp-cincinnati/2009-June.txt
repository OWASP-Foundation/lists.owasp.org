  a.. The Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID) - 2009 Analysis Ryan Barnett -Breach Security Inc 
  The web hacking incident database (WHID) is a Web Application Security Consortium project dedicated to maintaining a list of web applications related security incidents. WHID goal is to serve as a tool for raising awareness of the web application security problem and provide information for statistical analysis of web applications security incidents. The database is unique in tracking only media reported security incidents that can be associated with a web application security vulnerability. This presentation will highlight the statistics gathered from the 1st half of 2009 (January - June) and provide insight into categories such as: 1) Top Attack Methods, 2) Top Compromise Outcomes, 3) Top Target Geographic Region, 4) Top Vertical Markets Hit. The presenter will also provide some in-depth analysis for emerging threats/attack techniques such as planting of malware on websites and reflected cross-site scripting through sql injection. 
  a.. Presenter Bio 
  Ryan Barnett is the Director of Application Security Research at Breach Security where he leads Breach Security Labs. He is a Member of the Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) where he leads the Distributed Open Proxy Honeypot Project. He is also the leader of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) Project which provides web application firewall rules to the public. Mr. Barnett is a frequent speaker at industry conferences such as Blackhat and he has also authored a web security book for Pearson Publishing entitled "Preventing Web Attacks with Apache."

List

this is the WHID report and the analysis of  2008. IIt is interesting because it takes into account the attacker motives that is a threat agent factor in the threat analysis.
Also provides metrics on the most used vulnerabilities for the attacke motives and the most popular targets (e.g. companies, organizations) for the attacks.

The June presentation will cover the first six months of 2009 with a slightly different analysis more targeting the type of attacks and impact (e.g. top compromise outcomes) as well as target factors by geography and market.

Hope this is useful

I have a customer that is being hit with over 3 millions requests a day and
they have no customers yet :-) They are all attacks with the usual
smattering of language and framework probe urls.

My initial response was to try to firewall block the requesting IPs but
there are 21,000 unique source IPs driving the attack.

So,

1) Is it reasonable to block 21K IPs?

2) is there another solution that I should be looking for?

3) Is there a security consultant that we could hire to address this issue?

Ed

can you explain better what you mean for:  "they are all attacks usual smattering of language and framework probe urls" ..

is this a bandwitdth attack like iFrame DDoS? I would think IP filtering of that amount of IPs is possible but is not the only defense of DDoS (*), you need to apply defense in depth at both network and application layer. At the network layer you can routing traffic to other servers, use DPI/packet dropping, set routers defenses like Ciso IOS, set Intrusion Prevention Systems defenses etc.  On the application it depends on what you can do with the web pages on the site, can you overload the web server with mutliple requests to visit web pages, do these have large images etc...

Hope you have some DDoS security expert reply to this post, I am not, sorry...hope this is usueful

Regards

Marco

Ed,
Longtime lurker, first-time poster.  Howdy.
:
1) IMO, No.  The source IP's could be spoofed (depending on the nature 
of the actual attack) and you'd find yourself blocking IP's who may be 
legitimate customers... when you eventually have customers, anyways.  
Blocking IP's is a very coarse and unreliable defense.

2) Silly question, but... Is it causing a DoS condition for you, or just 
an annoyance?  You didn't really say anything about what sort of 
capacity they have.  3M hits per day on my little P3 web server would be 
an issue.  3M hits/day on a 4-way Opteron fed by a pair of DS3's... 
feh...  Still, 3M hits is a lot - you've ended up on somebody's target 
list for some reason.  You may want to ask your hosting provider if 
they're getting similar reports from other customers (you may have an IP 
address near a machine that was compromised, so they're looking for 
machines "nearby" to also target).  You may also want to make sure that 
none of those attacks have succeeded in finding any holes.  If they 
don't have customers yet, hopefully they do have a real app up and not 
just a "You've installed Apache" page.  Lots of questions, but it would 
be good to better understand the problem before delving into solutions.

3) Of course.  Unfortunately I don't know anybody locally that 
specializes in such matters - hopefully somebody on the list does.  If 
you'd settle for somebody with a day job to bat ideas around with... 
well, here's my email address. :-)

Also, to Marco's suggestions... Are you seeing attacks at the network 
layer as well?  How much control do you have over the infrastructure - 
is this a virtual server at a hosting provider somewhere, or do you 
control everything from the ISP connection back?  More control gives you 
more options.

Hi Ed,

Terry and Marco already gave some good suggestions, so I'll just add a few things. I would agree that a flat IP blacklist is probably not the best option here, although the best solution will depend on the details of the situation, and will probably involve multiple layers. At the network level, a combination of traditional IPS blacklisting and reputation-based filtering might be able to filter out a significant bit of the noise, depending on the client's current network hardware and where the traffic is coming from. If these hits are adversely affecting an application's performance or availability, then you might consider a caching reverse proxy to offload some of the weight from the application server. If web application vulnerabilities are a concern, then a WAF like mod_security with a well-constructed whitelist (see mod_profiler) may be able to provide some assurance.

Also, if you are interested in assistance, feel free to contact me. I represent a local company that specializes in network and application security services for southern Ohio and KY.

Thanks,

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Session Destroy References
Message-ID: <6a216ba20906251424l686748b8m6a5fbe18a6ecb24f@mail.gmail.com>

I was looking for a reference to send someone on recommendations on why to
destroy the web session on login and logout. I could only find the "Destroy
Session on Logout" reference in this OWASP document but nothing for the
login process. Did I miss something or is it something we need to add?

I think the session management of this page is not updated with the explicit recommendation of invalidating session at login to prevent session fixation/hijacking.
It is mentioned to re-generate tokens prior to any significant transaction, indeed should be more detailed mentioning authentication/login as a transaction

OWASP session fixation is covered here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation

and here
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Session_Fixation_(OWASP-SM-003)

regeneration of session upon authentication is also covered herein
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A7

and the code review guide
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Codereview-Session-Management

Regards

Marco
