OWASP Newsletter #16 (02-May-2008) 

Welcome to the 16th edition of the OWASP Newsletter, featuring OWASP at the
Secure360 Conference, the OWASP Internship, and the release of OWASP's Top
10 in Portuguese. 

I would like to congratulate the OWASP Spain chapter for receiving one of
the most prestigious awards of the security sector in Spain, for their
activity and dissemination of security in applications and Web services in
our country! This award, given by the SIC magazine (www.revistasic.com) in
its nineteenth congress called "Securm?tica" (www.securmatica.com), involves
the recognition of the effort they are making from Spain to publicize the
objectives and projects the OWASP. 

As always, if you have any content to add to the next edition, please feel
free to add it directly to its WIKI page

Here is more info on the presentation

Surviving and Succeeding in E-Discovery; Managing Electronic Information and
Forensics as Evidence

About this presentation:

Now  is  the  time  to  prepare  to  defend  the  integrity  of  your
security  practices,  and  learn  how  to  apply  your  security  skills  to
better  protect  the  legal  rights  of  your  organization.  This intensive
one day  program  delivers  answers  to  the  following  critical
questions  (before  you  are  asked  to  answer  them  under  oath!):

How will the adequacy of my information security controls be
challenged in the courtroom?

What can I expect hostile lawyers and investigators to ask
regarding our procedures to locate and preserve relevant electronic
information?


How will our policies on securing unstructured data, remote
access, backup tape management and systems logs be exploited for unfair
advantages in litigation or enforcement actions?


What steps must we take to evaluate our current control
environment and institute improved processes to achieve a defensible
standard of care?


How do I use forensic techniques to demonstrate that some data
simply cannot be reasonably accessed and produced?

A brief blog entry on the OWASP CSRF Guard:  
http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/secu/article.php/3739621

Has anyone used CSRFGuard?  I'm curious to hear how well the generated 
token works in cases where a page has multiple forms.  Does each form 
get it's own token?  Do they wind up getting the same token as a hidden 
field on each form?  Does it really matter?

Joe

Dear fellow Cincy OWASP attendees

 

Today's meeting:

We had good participation to the event today, I counted 15 people. 

I would like to mention the new attendees Kevin Hunter, John Whisman and
Mike Reiter.

Welcome to OWASP and please do not hesitate to join the mailing list.

 

The presentation is herein included for your reference.  

I promise to follow up on the question about CSRF and XHR.

 

Again I apologize for the logistical problems with the room media system

and the lack of internet connection to show CSRF Tester in operation.

 

Announcements:

Also I would like to announce Andy Erickson in the new role of OWASP PR. 

Andy has been instrumental to publicize about OWASP locally here in
Cincinnati.

Andy thanks again for your support.

We are also planning another sponsored event with Microsoft ACE Team, but
nothing to disclose at this point.

I'll keep you posted.

 

Next Meeting:

June 24: SQL Injection: Dr. James Walden

 

In the mean time, please do not hesitate to use this mailing list for
exchanging ideas on strengthen the

application security within the local tech community

 

Regards

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] CSRF lesson in WebGoat
Message-ID: <DA235E4D5FD3CE4C8B77382F0837274C1BBEF4@EXCHMAIL01.corp.medplus.com>

Hi there, 

 

I have been trying the CSRF lesson in Web Goat, I kept seeing this error
message: * Could not add message to database

 

After debugging WebGoat, it does not seem like that is the problem. Even
if I copy the message right there from "Hint", I still do not get a
checkmark. 

 

Did I miss anything?

 

Thanks, 

Yan

It's probably been close to 18 months since I ran through any of the
lessons in WebGoat but at the time there were still some bugs in some of
the lessons that kept it from ever showing as completed, even if you did
get the solution correct.
