<PRE>Sorry Andy!  I was obviously a bit ill informed.  I was speaking only from what I saw on the web site.  I'm not sure why, but I have not seen the recent invitation.  My junk mail filter seems to be catching some, but not all, owasp.org email, which might explain it.  I've corrected that.

At any rate, I am glad to see I was confused and I will make every effort to attend this week's event.  Mobile security is a very hot topic for me (and everyone in the industry, I suppose).

Hey Jamie,

Not sure what you are referring to. We have met 2 off the 3 months since Marco left and we have a meeting this Thursday. I have not had a chance to update the website but did send out a email and Eventbrite last week. Here is the link of you can make it.  <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2796437219?utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new_eventv2&amp;utm_term=eventurl_text">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2796437219?utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=new_eventv2&amp;utm_term=eventurl_text</A>

I have not been particularly active since I started working in Dayton, nearly 2 years ago.  None the less, I would hate to think that this chapter can't outlive Marco's relocation.

What say you?
