<PRE>OWASP Chapter attendees

 

Thanks for responding to the call of registering to the OWASP event, the
movie premiere of The New Face of Cybercrime. We currently have more then 45
people registered to the event. There is still time for RSVP by visiting the
site <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#April_Meeting">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#April_Meeting</A>

 

I would also announce that the speaker introducing the movie will be Maj.
Bruce C. Jenkins. Major Bruce C. Jenkins, (USAF, Ret.) is a Security
Practice Director at Fortify Software, Inc., where his responsibilities
include refining customer security requirements, managing Fortify product
deployments and the delivery of security services.

 

Prior to joining Fortify, he spent 26 of his 28 years in the service leading
people, managing projects, and dealing with technological and organizational
change.  His military experiences range from managing a small team of
aircraft avionics technicians to commanding a communications unit supporting
over 3,000 U.S. and international forces in Southwest Asia.  During his last
military assignment as Chief of Systems Security, 554th Electronic Systems
Wing, he helped build the foundation for what is now the U.S. Air Force
Application Software Assurance Center of Excellence.

 

Bruce holds a BS in computer science from the University of Maryland and MS
in operations research from the Air Force Institute of Technology.  He is a
Certified Ethical Hacker with countless hours of Internet surf time, where
he has learned that paranoia is a perfectly legitimate state of mind

 

Also I would like to special thanks Andy Erickson of lucrum
(www.lucruminc.com &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lucruminc.com/">http://www.lucruminc.com/</A>&gt; ) for publicizing the event
and hosting a podcast on the event
