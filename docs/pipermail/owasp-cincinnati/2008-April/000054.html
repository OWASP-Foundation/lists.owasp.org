<PRE>OWASP Cincinnati members

 

Thanks for participating to the April 22nd event. Wayne Browning and Allison
Shubert especially as organizers first of all thanks for your support and
time spent on organizing the event. As chapter lead I am very happy on how
things turned out in terms of local participation. A counted about 40 people
attending the event that is the most people attending we never had. We also
showed how enthusiastic our OWASP chapter in Cincinnati is on the topic of
application security.

 

One little mishap I had was on my behalf for the OWASP books that were not
shipped on time to be delivered at the event.

I pledged to give away 10 Lulu OWASP books and I'll maintain the promise.

Please respond to my email if you would like to receive the books and I will
deliver them to you to the next meeting. 

 

The next meeting we plan a dive on CSRF Cross Site Request Forgery
Vulnerability. I received a proposal for a session on CAPTCHA, Software
Security Enhanced Lifecycles and SQL Injection. I encourage anybody to
submit a topic for presentation if interested.

 

Also, please feel free to use this mailing list to continue the topic of
discussion we had started after the movie.

 

With best regards

 

Marco Morana

OWASP Cincinnati Chapter Leader
