NKU is holding our 9th annual cybersecurity symposium on October 21st and
we're looking for speakers for an audience of security and IT
professionals.  Topics of particular interest include healthcare IT
security, Internet of Things security, and ransomware, but we're looking
for speakers on all topics.  If you are interested, please submit a
proposal with your name, a title, and an abstract to
http://bit.ly/nkucybersec.

If you would like to see last year's agenda, you can find it under this
year's symposium page at

You can also register at that page if you're interested in attending but
not speaking.

If you have any questions about a talk, please contact me directly at the
