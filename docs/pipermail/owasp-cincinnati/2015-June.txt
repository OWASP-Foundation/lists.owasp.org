All,

I received a great response from many of you letting me know that you do
want to keep the chapter alive and we are working towards that end. I spoke
with and met with a few of you that are interested in helping lead the
group and we talked about trying to schedule a meeting for this month.

Then along came the birth of my newest daughter and my life has been
hijacked again. It's only a temporary hiccup and we will keep things going.

I did want to pass along to you an event that is happening this month that
I'm very excited about. My good friend from Atlanta, Mike Rothman, will be
in town for a breakfast event sponsored by Secure Content Technologies.

Mike is a security analyst with Securosis, an IS Research and Analysis
firm. Mike is a great speaker and very knowledgeable. I encourage you to
attend if you are able.

Also, just so everyone knows this is not a sales event. SCT is sponsoring
but will not give a sales pitch.

Hope to see some of you there.
