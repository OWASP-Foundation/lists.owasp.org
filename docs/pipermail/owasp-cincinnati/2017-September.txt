I wanted to take a few minutes and remind you of a couple of upcoming events that may be of interest to you.

On Friday October 13th NKU is hosting their 10th Annual CyberSecurity Symposium. This is a great event that provides talks on a wide range of not only security but also legal topics that affect security. You can get more information and register here. https://nku.eventsair.com/QuickEventWebsitePortal/cybersecurity/symposium

On Tuesday October 24th SecureWorld Expo will be returning to Cincinnati for the 3rd year. You can get more information and register here. https://events.secureworldexpo.com/details/cincinnati-oh-2017/

I?d love to see some of you at these events and if you are make sure to find me and say Hi.

Thanks,

Andy Willingham

> 
> Hi,
> 
> Thanks again for inviting Security Compass to present at one of your chapter meetings earlier this year.  We presented the results of our 2017 Managing Application Security Report and several attendees asked how they could participate in the 2018 survey.
> 
> We are pleased to announce that our 2018 survey is now open, and we would like to invite any interested chapter members to take the survey by clicking on this link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/scmas2018  
> 
> Would you be willing to cascade this note to your chapter members? It should take no more than 10 minutes to complete and their data will be treated as confidential. We are happy to provide a confidentiality note for their legal team or sign an MNDA if they wish. The information will be compiled into our 2018 Managing Application Security Report.
> 
> In return for participation, we will send participants a comparison of their results vs. industry peers at no cost.
> 
> We presented the 2017 results more than 20 times to hundreds of people, including to last year's survey participants, at major information security conferences, and at numerous local application security chapter events. The report received major news coverage, including in Dark Reading (http://www.darkreading.com/application-security/financial-institutions-less-appsec-savvy-than-youd-think/d/d-id/1328364), and sparked significant industry conversations about application security. A copy of the 2017 report can be found here: https://www.securitycompass.com/managingapplicationsecurity2017/
> 
> We?d be happy to walk you through our detailed 2017 results if you are interested in learning more.
