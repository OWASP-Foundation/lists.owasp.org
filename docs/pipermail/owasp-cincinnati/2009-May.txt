OWASP T10 Vulnerabilities and Security Design Flaws Root Causes Marco Morana, OWASP Chapter Lead 

The fact that security flaws are still so pervasive in web applications today highlights the need to identify and fix them by looking at the root causes in the application architecture. This presentation will look at OWASP T10 vulnerabilities from the perspective of root causes in design and provide examples on how these vulnerabilities can be identified in a threat model and mitigated by using secure design patterns to design countermeasures that mitigate vulnerabilities at different layers of the application architecture.
