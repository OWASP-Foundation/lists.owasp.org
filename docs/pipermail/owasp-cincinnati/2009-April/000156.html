  a.. Presentation: Bad Cocktail: Application Security Flaws + Targeted Phishing 
Rohyt Belani is CEO and co-founder of the Intrepidus Group : Site takedown services, anti-phishing filters, and millions of dollars worth of protective technologies...and the spear phishers are still successful! This presentation will discuss why this is the case. Today, phishing is a key component in a &quot;hackers&quot; repertoire. Phishers are combining social engineering with application security flaws in well known websites to make automated detection of targeted phishing attacks almost impossible. The result - hijacked online brokerage accounts, stolen identities and e-bank robberies. During this talk, I will present the techniques used by attackers to execute such spear phishing attacks, and real-world cases that I have responded to that will provide perspective on the impact. I will then discuss countermeasures that have been proven to be effective and are recommended by reputed bodies like SANS and Carnegie Mellon University.
