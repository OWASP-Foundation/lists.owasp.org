Marco,

Have you seen some of the stuff coming out of the mailing list lately? The
one today looks suspicious, it says to read the attached text file, but the
attachment is an executable... Also, the last few mailings have been error

Andrea Cogliati Owner & Security Consultant, Dollos Srl:"Learn How to
Develop Secure Web Applications with the OWASP Enteprise Security API" ESAPI
(The OWASP Enterprise Security API)
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API>  is
a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it
easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries
are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into
existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation
for new development. The following organizations are a few of the many
organizations that are starting to adopt ESAPI to secure their web
applications: American Express, Apache Foundation, Booz Allen Hamilton,
Aspect Security, Foundstone(McAfee), The Hartford, Infinite Campus, Lockheed
Martin, MITRE, U.S. Navy - SPAWAR, The World Bank, SANS Institute. 

Speaker Bio: Andrea's first approach with IT occurred at the age of 8, when
his father purchased the third Commodore PET 2001 sold in Italy. He soon
started programming in BASIC and 6502 assembler. A few years later, while
still at high school, he begun his professional career as a programmer for a
small software house, Ultimobyte Editrice. In the late 80s his employer
became the Italian sole agent for McAfee Antivirus program so he started his
journey into IT Security, focusing in virus and anti-virus technologies and
supporting McAfee Italian customers: cooperation with McAfee lasted several
years and in 1995 he was part of the very first McAfee AVERT (now McAfee
AVERT Labs). In 1998, after graduating in Mathematics at Scuola Normale
Superiore in Pisa, Andrea joined Mondadori Informatica Education (the first
and most important Authorized Microsoft Training Center in Italy) as a
trainer and consultant; he also spoke at several national conferences and
events sponsored by Microsoft. In 2000 he moved to Algol, the major Cisco
and Extreme Networks distributor in Italy as AlgolCollege New Business
Developer Manager. He taught classes on Microsoft, Extreme Networks and
Compaq technologies in Italy and EMEA. In 2002 he founded a small
consultancy and training company focused solely in IT Security, which was
eventually awarded by the Province of Milan as one of the most innovative
companies for a biometrics authentication project. In 2006 Andrea started
his cooperation with Andrea Provaglio, developing and teaching security
courses for software architects and developers. In 2007 he moved to
Rochester, NY where he started to collaborate with local ISSA and OWASP
chapters and spoke at his first conference abroad. Andrea holds (or has
held) several Microsoft, Cisco, Extreme Networks, McAfee and Compaq
certifications and he's also a BS7799 Lead Auditor. When not working, he
enjoys playing keyboards with an amateur rock band. He also likes to cook
for his family and friends and share his wine tasting experiences. 

Looking forward to see you on the 21st

About 50 companies were affected by a major security breach at e-mail
service provider Epsilon Interactive that caused many U.S. corporations to
warn their customers of online attacks Monday.

Epsilon first warned of the incident Friday, saying that someone had got
into company systems and obtained e-mail addresses and names belonging to
some of its customers. But it wasn't immediately clear how many of its 2,500
clients were at risk. Epsilon is still being tight-lipped about the problem,
but it has now given a clearer picture of how many companies are affected.

In a brief statement posted to Epsilon's website Monday, the company said
that "approximately 2 percent of total clients" -- about 50 businesses --
were hit.

 

Customers of many of these businesses, which include Target, Citigroup, Tivo
and Walgreens, woke up Monday to e-mail warnings, telling them that their
e-mail addresses had been stolen, and that spam or malicious messages could
be coming their way. But so far, Epsilon has refused to provide a detailed
list of all companies that were affected.

Business banking fraud -- particularly in small and midsize companies -- is
still causing major problems for both the businesses and the banks that
serve them, according to a study published today.

 

The "2011 Business Banking Trust Study," a follow-up to a similar study
conducted last year, was written by Ponemon Institute and sponsored by
Guardian Analytics. This year's numbers suggest that the banking fraud
situation has not improved since 2010.

 

"The industry has not moved the needle in addressing the corporate account
takeover and fraud plaguing SMBs and their financial institutions," the
report states. "The data shows that fraud is still pervasive, money is
leaving accounts unnoticed at an alarming rate, and businesses will leave
their banks because of it."

 

Fifty-six percent of businesses experienced fraud in the past 12 months,
according to the study. Of those that experienced fraud, 61 percent were
victimized more than once. Seventy-five percent of the victims experienced
online account takeover and/or online fraud. These figures are nearly the
same as last year's, the researchers say.

years and in 1995 he was part of the very first McAfee AVERT (now McAfee
AVERT Labs). In 1998, after graduating in Mathematics at Scuola Normale
Superiore in Pisa, Andrea joined Mondadori Informatica Education (the first
and most important Authorized Microsoft Training Center in Italy) as a
trainer and consultant; he also spoke at several national conferences and
events sponsored by Microsoft. In 2000 he moved to Algol, the major Cisco
and Extreme Networks distributor in Italy as AlgolCollege New Business
Developer Manager. He taught classes on Microsoft, Extreme Networks and
Compaq technologies in Italy and EMEA. In 2002 he founded a small
consultancy and training company focused solely in IT Security, which was
eventually awarded by the Province of Milan as one of the most innovative
companies for a biometrics authentication project. In 2006 Andrea started
his cooperation with Andrea Provaglio, developing and teaching security
courses for software architects and developers. In 2007 he moved to
Rochester, NY where he started to collaborate with local ISSA and OWASP
chapters and spoke at his first conference abroad. Andrea holds (or has
held) several Microsoft, Cisco, Extreme Networks, McAfee and Compaq
certifications and he's also a BS7799 Lead Auditor. When not working, he
enjoys playing keyboards with an amateur rock band. He also likes to cook
for his family and friends and share his wine tasting experiences. 

Looking forward to see you on the 21st
