Title:       "OWASP Mobile Top Ten 2014 ? The New "Lack of Binary Protection" Category?
Subtitle: ?Mobile Applications and All of the Bad things that can happen to your Information and IP Inside them?
 
Abstract: "Recently, there has been a new addition to the OWASP Mobile Top Ten. At AppSec California, OWASP debuted the 2014 list and briefly highlighted examples of threats in the new M10 category.  In my talk, I discuss the new category in much more depth.  I educate the audience about the prevalence of binary risks in both iPhone and Android mobile apps.  I highlight mobile app risks that relate to this new category and how to leverage particular OWASP Projects for the solution.  By the end of this talk, you will have a solid understanding of binary risk and how to begin thinking about solutions to this category."

Speaker:  Matt Clemens is a Security Solutions Architect for Arxan Technologies, focusing on application security. Before joining Arxan in 2013 Matt spent 20 years in a variety of roles in the semiconductor and embedded processor industries. 

I hope to see y'all at the meeting and come hungry as our sponsor is providing Pizza and Drinks. 

Thanks,
