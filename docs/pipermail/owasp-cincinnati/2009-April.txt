Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Foundstone Hacme Books (how to refresh database)
Message-ID: <DA235E4D5FD3CE4C8B77382F0837274C0144428C@EXCHMAIL01.corp.medplus.com>

Hi there, 

 

While using Hacme Books to learn security, I cannot seem to find a way
to refresh the database, i.e., remove the extra data I added through Web
UI. 

 

Anyone knows how to refresh the database used by FoundStone Hacme Books
application (without having to reinstall it)? Looks like it is use a
file driven database but I cannot find it.

 

Thanks, 

Yan

  a.. Presentation: Bad Cocktail: Application Security Flaws + Targeted Phishing 
Rohyt Belani is CEO and co-founder of the Intrepidus Group : Site takedown services, anti-phishing filters, and millions of dollars worth of protective technologies...and the spear phishers are still successful! This presentation will discuss why this is the case. Today, phishing is a key component in a "hackers" repertoire. Phishers are combining social engineering with application security flaws in well known websites to make automated detection of targeted phishing attacks almost impossible. The result - hijacked online brokerage accounts, stolen identities and e-bank robberies. During this talk, I will present the techniques used by attackers to execute such spear phishing attacks, and real-world cases that I have responded to that will provide perspective on the impact. I will then discuss countermeasures that have been proven to be effective and are recommended by reputed bodies like SANS and Carnegie Mellon University. 

  a.. Presenter Bio

This may not be much help now, but if I were doing this, I would probably install it in a virtual machine (using VirtualBox or VMWare) and then take a snapshot after installing it so that I could revert to the snapshot whenever I wanted and have a clean install again.
