Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Follow up on Webgoat and Webscarab,
	Next OWASP Meeting Feb. 26th 7 PM
Message-ID: <47b188a1.0da1260a.3df4.0b69@mx.google.com>

Fellow OWASP Cincinnati chapter members

 

There has been a good follow up after the first OWASP chapter meeting. How
to use Webgoat proxy seems to have caught most of the attention.

I mentioned that OWASP recently published some free OWASP books under Lulu
and also a book about OWASP released tools: Webgoat and Webscarab
<http://www.lulu.com/content/1416452> http://www.lulu.com/content/1416452

 

Using these tools is a great way to learn about web application
vulnerabilities. 

The current lesson plan for Webgoat has more than 50 vulnerability test
cases to learn. All basic common vulnerabilities are included such as XSS,
SQL injection, weak session management, broken authentication and
authorization. Web services vulnerabilities are also covered.

 

Moving forward to the next meeting, I will cover how to look for the root
causes for these vulnerabilities that is insecure source code.

The presentation will cover more in depth the contents of my recently
published article on in-secure magazine available here:

http://www.net-security.org/dl/insecure/INSECURE-Mag-15.pdf

 

Please mark your calendar for the next OWASP meeting: Tuesday February 26th,
2008, 6.45pm - 7:45pm Presentation start 7.00 pm

Consult the OWASP chapter web page for more details.

 

Hope to see you there, in the mean time, I hope you'll stay warm and dry ;-)

found, tools etc) that you would like me to talk to please drop me a note,

Fellow OWASP Cincinnati chapter meeting attendees

 

We currently have 32 members subscribing the OWASP Cincinnati chapter
mailing list (herein included) so I am looking for a good participation to
the next meeting next Tuesday, February 26th, 2008, 6.45pm - 7:45pm at
Citigroup in Blue Ask.

 

Please provide your RSVP to me by replying to this email. Also if you have
not subscribed the OWASP Cincinnati mailing list, please do so.

The meeting session topic is: OWASP Top Ten Vulnerabilities and Software
Root Causes: Solving The Software Security Problem From an Information
Security Perspective. 

Presenter: Marco Morana (Citigroup, TISO, OWASP Chapter Leader, Security
Blogger). Abstract of the presentation: Before to diagnose the disease and
provide the cure a doctor looks at the root causes of the sickness, the risk
factors and the symptoms. In case of application security the majority of
the root causes of the security issues are in-secure software, the risk
factors can be found in how bad the application is designed, the software is
coded and the application is tested and the symptoms in how the application
vulnerabilities are exposed. The presentation will articulate the problem of
secure software, the costs, the software security risks and how these are
typically dealt with by most organizations. Solving the problem of software
security requires people, process and tools. From the information security
perspective we will look at ways to enforcing software security by looking
at risks that threat agents (attacks) can exploit vulnerabilities due to
insecure software and the resulting impact on company assets. Implementing a
set of software security requirements is the best place to start to address
the root causes of web application vulnerabilities. With a categorization of
web application vulnerabilities as weakness in application security
controls, it is easier to describe the root cases as coding errors. A good
place to start documenting software security requirements is the OWASP Top
Ten, for each of these vulnerabilities we will discuss the threat, the risk
factors, the software root causes of the vulnerability, how to find if you
are vulnerable and if you are which countermeasures need to be implemented.

Presentation start 7.00 pm

Consult the OWASP chapter web page for more details. The presentation will
be uploaded on the site.

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Could someone explain how to bypass CSRF attack
	with stored XSS
Message-ID: <288A3B43F7B2224D9C8441C9FC5D6A02033871B7@EXCHMAIL01.corp.medplus.com>

Hi there, 

 

Could someone explain in a little more detail how this is done? I think
I know the principle, but would like to see how that is actually carried
out. 

 

Thanks,

Yan

 


Bypass CSRFGuard With Stored XSS 


There have been discussions suggesting that the unique request token can
be compromised using JavaScript. This attack implies that the
application also contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability,
which is frequently a more severe issue than cross-site request forgery.
The first MySpace worm worked in this manner where it used a Cross Site
Scripting vulnerability to forge requests to update a user's profile,
where the user profile update mechanism was protected with a CSRF
defense mechanism similar to what is provided by this filter. If your
application contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability, then
the unique request token can be parsed from the HTML response to
successfully forge form submissions.

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] PCI compliance for protecting PANs and Minnesota
	Data Breach Laws
Message-ID: <47c63869.365f260a.3e3a.ffffec35@mx.google.com>

Fellow OWASP Cincinnati members

 

Thanks for your enthusiastic participation to the last meeting. There were
only 9 people attending and because of the weather conditions I could not
for more people attending the meeting,  frankly speaking. It has been a long
presentation on my behalf because of all the material I had to cover, again
I apologize for the extra time taken.

 

The presentation will be posted soon on the OWASP site.

 

I just wanted to address further some of the questions being asked during
the presentation regarding:

 

1) PCI compliance for encrypting PAN: PANs (CCN's or Primary Account
Numbers) should be protected with one of the methods as for 3.4. (*)
(digest, truncation, strong encryption, tokens and pads)  unless all
compensating control as for appendix B are in place (segmentation, access
control to credit card data via device IP, application, user accounts,
packet filtering) , restricted logical access to DB and SQL injection
mitigation..

(*)  <https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/pci_dss_v1-1.pdf>
https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/pci_dss_v1-1.pdf

 

2) State of Minnesota law that prevent to store credit card magnetic strip
information, CVV2 and PINs. Indeed the state of Minnesota has a data breach
law that prohibit entities conducting business in Minnesota from retaining
credit or debit card security code data, PIN verification codes, or the full
contents of any track of magnetic stripe data for more than 48 hours after
the authorization of a transaction. The credit and debit card data retention
provisions become effective on August 1, 2007. Minnesota also holds
merchants strictly liable for costs incurred by financial institutions who
assist consumers following the discovery of a security breach. The retailer
liability provisions become effective on August 1, 2008

There has also been interest on dedicating a specific session on the CSRF
vulnerability (5h in the OWASP T10) . Maybe we can dedicate a session to
CSRF and CSRF tools in April. In the mean time, please refer to CSRF testing
web page here: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_CSRF  and the tool
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF_Guard

The next session will cover use of source code analysis tools and use of
penetration testing to find common vulnerabilities in web applications.

Again thanks for your participation
