Just in time for summer, OWASP is pleased announce 2 new individual
membership options - purchase a two year membership for $95 USD (a $5
savings), or a lifetime membership for $500 USD.  In addition to all the
regular benefits of individual membership, when you purchase our new

Some of the benefits you will receive as an individual member include a
