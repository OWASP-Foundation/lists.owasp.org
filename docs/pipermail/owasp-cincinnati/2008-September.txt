Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] program to break weak encryption
Message-ID: <DA235E4D5FD3CE4C8B77382F0837274C67782A@EXCHMAIL01.corp.medplus.com>

Hi there, 

 

Is there any program that can break weak encryption?

 

For example, the WebGoat lesson "Weak Authentication" uses weak
encryption for a authentication cookie (see below). I wonder if there is
any program that would take these input, guess the encryption algorithm,
and show the encrypted value for some additional given input. This is
not just a brute-force attack, the program would try to figure out
encryption algorithm. I do not know if anyone has a link to such sites
or program.

 

65432ubphcfx  for  webgoat

65432udfqtb    for   aspect

 

Thanks, 

Yan Zhou

Hi Yan

you can use John the Ripper for password cracking: http://www.openwall.com/john/

A good reference for other tools is herein
http://packetstormsecurity.org/Crackers/indexsize.html

Be careful when you use these tools since might trigger IDS alerts.

If you are not authorized for a security assessment and it is just for
your knowledge/research I suggest to use the tools with your PC off
the network.

Regards

Marco

p.s. Defcon had an interesting presentation on these tools herein

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Presenting on Security topics at CodeMash - the
 premier regional developer event
Message-ID: <BE826D41946DF44E9EB4FBB439223B2B159E2CFCAA@lucrummail.clientserver.com>

OWASP Cincinnati has been looking for opportunities to spread the word and publicize the chapter's work here locally. The premier regional developer conference comes to Sandusky in January, and they're looking for speakers. This is a great opportunity for security-minded OWASP members to submit topic for consideration. If we can get a number of speaking slots it could go a long way for the OWASP organization.

I'll be there as the organizers have asked me to develop some footage of the event for the attendees. I'm looking to make some connections between the developer community where I have some solid relationships and the local OWASP community.

Check out codemash.org for details. I look forward to seeing some OWASP speakers there.

List

 

I actually recommend this course from Intrepidus Group too. I personally
worked with Corey and Aaron (one of the partners) while at Foundstone and
Rohit is a proved consultant with several years of application security
experience.

 

Also you cannot beat this price, I have seen similar courses cost 10- times
more. So if you have the time it is also worth the trip to Louisville from
Cincinnati.

 

Regards

 

Marco

OWASP Cincinnati Chapter September Meeting 

--------------------------------------------------------

 

WHEN: September 30th 12:00-1.30pm

 

WHAT: Input Validation Vulnerabilities, Encoded Attack Vectors and
Mitigations

 

WHERE: Citibank <http://www.citibank.com/>  9997 Carver Road, Bldg. 1,
Cincinnati, Ohio, 45242-5537

 

Presentation Abstract: Input validation vulnerabilities in web applications
can be exploited with attack vectors to cause business impacts such as
information disclosure, data alteration and destruction, denial or
degradation of service, financial loss fraud and reputation brand damage.
Several web applications today have implemented filtering techniques to
block such attack vectors; unfortunately such filtering techniques are
seldom based on black lists that fail when attackers use filter evasion
techniques such as single and double encoding. This presentation will cover
the basic understanding of attack vectors, the malicious payloads that can
be carried out and the techniques used by attackers to evade input
validation filters. Lists of different variations of encoded XSS attack
vectors and constructed SQL injection vectors will be presented. From the
defensive perspective, these lists can be used as cheat sheets for testing
the efficacy of the input filtering techniques. A demonstration of a sample
implementation of effective input validation using J2EE struts framework is
also presented. During the presentation, web application developers and
architects will be introduced to the concepts of canonicalization, encoding
and sanitization and guided on the most effective input validation
strategies and techniques as well as on the best use of available input
validation resources from OWASP.
