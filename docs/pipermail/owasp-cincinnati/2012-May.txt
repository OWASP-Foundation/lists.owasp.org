You are welcome to come to Bojan Simic's presentation on Eliminating
SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting Using Aspect Oriented
Programming.  It is scheduled for 10:00-11:30 on May30th on the campus
of Northern Kentucky University in the new informatics building,
Griffin Hall, room 570.  He is defending his MS/CS thesis on this
topic and will give a talk and a demonstration on how his software
protects against SQL injection and XSS attacks through the use of
aspect-oriented programming without changing your source code.
