I am the Secretary for the Ky Chapter of ISSA.  We are hosting our *6th
annual InfoSec conference* on Oct 9th, with a *2-day pre-conference Web
Application Security course, Oct 7th-8th, *presented by Intrepidus Group and
our keynote speaker - Rohyt Belani.  This is a local opportunity for CPE
credits, and an excellent educational opportunity for IT and Compliance
professionals.

I've attached a flyer for both the InfoSec and the App Security Course.
Register for the course, and attend the InfoSec Conference for Free!!

top IT professionals, as well as taking advantage of this unparelleled
