Hello OWASP Community,

The OWASP AppSec USA 2011 conference in Minneapolis is only two weeks away.
Classes are filling up fast (the OWASP WTE class is full), and the
conference talks lineup is impressive. Sign up today for the training on
September 20-21 and the main conference talks, CTF, showroom, and Open
Source Showcase on September 22-23!

http://www.appsecusa.org/


OWASP is in its tenth year, and application security is on everyone's radar.
And this year we have some wonderful new initiatives as part of OWASP AppSec
USA 2011. For the first time, we're:

* Funding the conference experience for two women in college through the
OWASP Women in AppSec grant. Congratulations to Tara Wilson and Chandni
Bhowmik on securing these grants! And thank you to The Wells Fargo
Foundation for its generous seed funding.

* Raising funds for science education for inner city youth with the 5K/10K
for Charity.

* Hosting a University Challenge offense/defense competition.

* Running an Open Source Showcase during the conference proceedings. Open
source community members will demo their awesome work.

Additionally, the OWASP Chapters Committee and the ESAPI and AppSensor teams
will be meeting September 21 to build upon their great work in OWASP.

Be a part of AppSec USA 2011, where OWASP propels itself into the next ten
years. Lots of cool talks and training. And many opportunities to learn,
grow, and give back.

We would like to thank the OWASP AppSec USA 2011 donors and sponsors and the
many conference contributors for helping us to build an awesome event for
the application security and development community.

Matt,

                There are two maps for NKU.  1) An interactive map at
http://www.nku.edu/campusmaps/map.php.  GH is Griffin Hall where the talk is
being held.  If you click on parking garage across the street, you will see
that it is Kenton Drive Parking Garage.  Park in this garage and we will
validate your ticket so you do not need to pay. 2)  3D campus map at
http://www.nku.edu/campusmaps/3dmap.html.  42 is the parking garage.
Griffin Hall is shown as a construction site across the street.

                If you need help, you can call me at (859) 380-2972.  

See you Saturday,

Chuck Frank

Message-ID: <4e72957d.04d6640a.35a9.ffffd59e@mx.google.com>

Dear fellow OWASP members

 

We had 53 people registered for the event Saturday! That's great news, thank
you all for enrolling. I also appreciate the PR work that NKU has done. 

 

We have still one day for RSVP so if you have not done it yet please do.

http://owasp-cincy-september.eventbrite.com/

 

This is a unique opportunity to hear a talk on software security from one of
thought leaders in security and the founder of software security discipline
himself.

 

I would like also to announce the new chapter leader, Andy Wayne Willingham.


 

Andy used to be the chapter leader of InfoGard in Atlanta. He currently
resides in Cincinnati and is colleague of mine at Citigroup where he is
Business Info. Security Officer of eBusiness.

 

I worked with Andy at Citi and I estimate him a lot for this security
knowledge and capability to lead Infosec initiatives. I am sure the OWASP
chapter will be well served by Andy. 

 

It is sad for me to relinquish my role as OWASP Cincinnati chapter leader
but I have to due to a career change that will take me away from Cincinnati
unfortunately, a city that I truly love very much. 

 

Well, I would also like to thank you for your support over these years and
also for enthusiastically participate to our chapter meetings. 

 

Since the chapter started in 2008 we grew up to 150 people  and we were able
to conduct monthly meeting and attracting very good speakers.  I hope that
you commitment to attend the meetings will continue in the years to come and
if you are not an OWASP member to become one. This is a fantastic
organization to be member to.

 

For the event Saturday, I will be there for checking in at 9 AM, breakfast
starts 9.30 offered by NKU book signing (bring your Secure Coding copy) at
10.00 AM. Gary's talks starts at 10.30AM till 11.30 EST

 

I hope to see you at NKU Saturday so we can enjoy together the OWASP-NKU
event.

 

With best regards

 

Marco Morana
