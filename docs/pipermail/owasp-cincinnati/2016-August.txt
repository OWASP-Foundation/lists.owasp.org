All,

 

I wanted to pass on some information about an upcoming conference. This year
SecureWorld Cincinnati will be returning for the second year. They have
offered us a discount again and I wanted to pass this on to you. The
conference will be held on Thursday Sept 8th at the Sharonville Convention
Center and there is an additional training opportunity called "SecureWorld
Plus" the day before on Wednesday Sept 7th.  The attached flyer has
information on how to register and the discount code. Each day of the event
can earn you up to 6 CPEs towards your professional certifications plus the
networking opportunity is invaluable.

 

Hope to see you there.

All,

 

It appears that the server removed the attachment from my message this
morning. If you are interested please let me know and I'll pass on the
document so you will have the registration and discount information.

 

Thanks,
