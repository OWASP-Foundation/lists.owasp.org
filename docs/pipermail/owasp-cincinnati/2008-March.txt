a member. In addition to the current Membership benefits, the new OWASP
members will be able to allocate membership fees to SoC 2008 projects they
are interested in. 

*	There is no geographical, age or any other form of restrictions to
who can apply for an "OWASP Summer of Code 2008" sponsorship. The only
requirement is that the candidate shows the potential to accomplish the
project's objectives and the commitment to dedicate the time required to

Fellow OWASP Cincinnati members

 

The March meeting will be held on March 26.  The current time for the
meeting is TBD since we plan to set the time that best fit your needs.

 

We will cover the following topics:

Source Code Reviews and Open Source Static Analysis Tools 

Presented by: Allison Shubert, Security Specialist, Citigroup 

Static analysis is the process of analyzing software for security
vulnerabilities. Static analysis can be a costly and time consuming process,
but is a link in the chain for producing secure software. Join us as we
explorer building a business case for static analysis and review the current
open source static analysis tools. 

An Introduction to Web Proxies 

Presented by: Blaine Wilson, Technology Information Security Officer,
Citigroup 

Web proxies will be explained and the group will be shown how to install and
configure WebScarab. WebScarab operates as an intercepting proxy, allowing
the operator to review and modify requests created by the browser before
they are sent to the server, and to review and modify responses returned
from the server before they are received by the browser. The presentation
will include several examples of intercepting, reviewing and modifying HTTP
requests and responses. 

More info on https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#March_Meeting

 

This is a meeting that you do not want to miss is you would like to know
more about source code analysis tools and web proxies and how can be used
for assessing secure applications. 

 

Please RSVP if you plan to attend by emailing to Blaine Wilson:

Message-ID: <47d5b399.2667260a.49bb.ffffb1b8@mx.google.com>

Hello,

 

Alessio has put a new version of the OWASP code review tool, Code crawler,
available for download.

It has a totally new look and feel and also runs SQL Server express for the
definitions.

The source is available also. Suggestions on new functionality are welcome.

 

Code crawler is a complementary tool associated with definitions defined in
the code review guide. It works best using both the guide and tool together.

Remember this is a beta tool, stable, but much functionality to implement.

It can be downloaded from the OWASP code review project site:

Dear Fellow OWASP Cincinnati Member

 

The April OWASP meeting will be sponsored by Fortify. 

 

We will show a premiere of the movie: The New Face of Cybercrime "@Work
Premiere"

The event will not be a marketing event but rather an opportunity to watch
the movie and introduce a discussion on application security.

 

This is a major opportunity for OWASP and also to give consideration to the
Cincinnati  application security community.

Cincinnati comes after San Francisco, New York, and London as the major
cities that this event took place.

I am very happy that we could accomplish this. The event will be coordinated
with other OWASP chapters in OHIO as well. 

 

Please mark the calendar

When: April 22

 

Time: This will be 2 hour event. I reserved two time slots between 12.30 AM
and 2.30 PM and between 5.30 PM and 7.30 PM

 

Where: Citigroup NA, Blue Ash

 

      Please let me know which time suits you the most by the end of the
week.

 

Stand by for the official invitation, I am looking forward to your active
participation.

 

All the best

What is it?  It's an offer to hold a "Premiere-like", private screening
event at Citigroup, and the OWASP staff.  

.  After the event, Fortify will sponsor a nice reception with appetizers
and cocktails.

 

Sample agenda:  

-          10 min.  Film Introduction - Fortify Exec

-          22 min. The New Face of Cybercrime film

-          30 min. Post-film discussion (group interaction)

OWASP Chapter fellow members

 

A trail of the movie that we are planning on April 22 is here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5zxOLZ5jXM

The full movie is actually 22 minutes long. I think is a great idea to kick
in a debate on cybercrime and application security.

An executive from Fortify will introduce the movie.

I am looking forward to your participation.

 

We have two choices between 12.30 AM and 2.30 PM and between 5.30 PM and
7.30 PM

 

The movie event is free, catering will also be provided.

 

I had few people getting back on the time frames.

Please let me know by the EOW.

 

Thank you

Presented by: Allison Shubert, Security Specialist, Citigroup 

Static analysis is the process of analyzing software for security
vulnerabilities. Static analysis can be a costly and time consuming process,
but is a link in the chain for producing secure software. Join us as we
explorer building a business case for static analysis and review the current
open source static analysis tools. 

An Introduction to Web Proxies 

Presented by:Blaine Wilson, Technology Information Security Officer,
Citigroup 

Web proxies will be explained and the group will be shown how to install and
configure WebScarab. WebScarab operates as an intercepting proxy, allowing
the operator to review and modify requests created by the browser before
they are sent to the server, and to review and modify responses returned
from the server before they are received by the browser. The presentation
will include several examples of intercepting, reviewing and modifying HTTP
requests and responses.

	6.30 PM @ Citigroup in Blue Ash
Message-ID: <47df0749.08d2260a.4675.3089@mx.google.com>

Fellow OWASP Cincinnati chapter participants

 

I kind of surprised that we have only 6 people confirming attendance to the
OWASP meeting on the 25th.

 

This is a very nice opportunity to get to learn source code analysis and web
penetration testing from experts in the field such as Mrs. Allison Shubert
and Mr. Blaine Wilson.

 

We are investing out time and resources for preparing the event and this is
for you free to attend.

 

Please if there is anything we can do to raise you interest or accommodate a
different time frame or day for the event please let us know.

 

Right now we are scheduled for the March 25th meeting at 6.30 PM

 

With best regards

Message-ID: <47e0f46a.2667260a.1ef0.03ca@mx.google.com>

Hi everyone,

 

I know many of you have blogs and mailing lists!  Please take this
opportunity to spread the word about OWASPs fantastic Summer of Code 2008.
Together we can accomplish something really amazing with this money, but we
need people to read the RFPs
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Request_for_Proposal_List) and apply
for grants.

 

Thanks for your help!

2008

 

Hi leaders,

 

As you know, a fortnight ago I've sent you all the email below asking for
help in order to advertise the OWASP
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Press_Release>
Summer of Code 2008. Unfortunately, I haven't received any answers which I
understood perfectly as you all certainly have loads of work to do and much
more interesting things to think about.  Therefore, I've assumed this task
on my own and I took a stab at trying to draw attention to this new season
of code. To do so, I've used the email list that I am sending in attach and
I just achieve these poor results <http://owaspsoc2008.wordpress.com/> . 

 

Due to that, I felt forced to chase you once again. I need to ask one more
time either for media/press email addresses or for you to send directly the
press
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Press_Release>
release to whom you find appropriate. Could you please help me out? Please
forgive my insistence - I thank you in advance. In my opinion, the SoC 2008
brings about a good opportunity to advertise the work that we all are trying
to do and it would be a drawback to waste it. 

 

Best regards,

 

Paulo Coimbra

OWASP Project Manager

Hi all,

 

First, I would like to sincerely thank to you all that have kindly welcomed
me. 

 

Next, as I am trying to advertise the launch of OWASP Summer of Code 2008, I

help me out? I thank you in advance.
