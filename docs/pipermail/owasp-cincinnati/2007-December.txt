Interesting tool developed by OWASP Greek chapter that uses the Google code
search API to scan open source code for vulnerabilities.

Hi all ,

Some time ago I started a little project (Bugle) which is a  
collection of patterns (regular expressions)  that can be use to find
bugs in open source projects using google. Then Google Code Search  
came and  made it a bit easier to display results using the
Code Search API  and allowed proper regular expressions.

So for the past couple of days I've been experimenting with jQuery  
and Code Search API  and made a web 2.0 friendly version of a web based
source code scanner using the Bugle list, you can have a look at   
http://www.cipher.org.uk/projects/bugle/auto/

It is not very IE friendly and possibly bugs will be all over.


Thanks

Manos
