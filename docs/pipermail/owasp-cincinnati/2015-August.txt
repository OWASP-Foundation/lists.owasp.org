Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] September Meeting!!!!!
Message-ID: <CAJM-gMPbf1ULKLhnOjy877SJyP6qKM9aysQ7=rUPG7uvEktRzA@mail.gmail.com>

Well, it took a while but we actually have a meeting scheduled. We will be
hosting Cigital as the come and speak to us about a topic that is near and
dear to our hearts, Secure Code Review.  Something that all of us need but
not nearly enough of us do. Not to mention is not easy but it sure is
needed.

Our meeting is on Wednesday September 2, 2015 at the Citi Office in Blue
Ash. Please register on our Eventbrite page at
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cincinnati-owasp-sept-2015-tickets-18185846356
to register so we will know how many to expect and to ensure that we have
enough Pizza.

There are a couple of more events that we will be doing before the end of
the year that I wanted to let you know about as well. First there will be
at least one more chapter meeting before the end of the year. We have a
couple of things in the works and depending on how they pan out we will get
them scheduled.

Second, we will be setting up a booth to promote our chapter at the SecureWorld
conference <https://www.secureworldexpo.com/cincinnati/home> that is coming
to town in October. If a couple of you would like to help man the booth
please let me know.   If you are just interested in attending there is a
discount code available here

.

I hope everyone has a great week and I look forward to seeing y'all at the
meeting on 9/2/15.
