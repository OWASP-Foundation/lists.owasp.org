Dear OWASP members and list subscribers

Unfortunately, none of Tenable security folks cannot make the talk to
Cincinnati OWASP as planned for November 18th (Plan A), see email herein
included.

Therefore, Plan B is to give you amy OWASP presentation on Web 2.0 Security.

This will give you a good opportunity to understand Web 2.0 threats and
devise countermeasures from application security perspective. I plan to
cover Web 2.0 vulnerabilities, secure software engineering and risk
management. I published the abstract of the presentation on our chapter's
web page for your further reference. 

If interested and available, you can RSVP through EventBrite at
http://owasp-cincinnati.eventbrite.com

Pizza will be offered to all participants thanks to our membership funds.
As usual, if not an OWASP member yet, please plan to do so for 2011.

Thanks for your attention and regards

Hi Marco,

I'm sorry to let you know, but we will be unable to participate in the
OWASP show in Cincinnati. I was hoping to possibly offer myself to
speaking Paul's place since he's unable to make the show, but I'm also
unavailable.

	OWASP Cincinnati Meeting: November 18th
Message-ID: <4cd9e9aa.8e4ee50a.5cdf.0112@mx.google.com>

Dear OWASP members and list subscribers

This is a reminder for RSVP to OWASP presentation on Web 2.0 Security.
You can RSVP through EventBrite at http://owasp-cincinnati.eventbrite.com

Here is the abstract of the presentation:
Vulnerability Analysis, Secure Development and Risk Management of Web 2.0
Applications 
According to the Gartner hype curve, Web 2.0 technologies have reached a
stage of mainstream adoption by businesses, therefore is critical for
information and application security to understand the security implications
of the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies. Web 2.0 not only amplify
traditional Web 1.0 vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF and data injection
vulnerabilities but also introduces new threats: this is due to the
intrinsic functionality that Web 2.0 technology is designed to provide. For
example, Web 2.0 technologies provide a richer client and user experience
than Web 1.0, foster user's collaboration to the sites through user's
provided content and brings customers closer to businesses through
participation to social networking sites. The first step is to perform a
vulnerability and threat analysis of Web 2.0 applications. From
vulnerability and threat analysis perspective, Web 2.0 application
vulnerabilities can be analyzed using both OWASP Top 10 and WASC Top 50
threats categorizations. Critical to the vulnerability analysis of Web 2.0
applications is the determination of the vulnerability root causes. Only
through the identification of the vulnerabilities root causes
vulnerabilities can be eradicated. The second step is build secure Web 2.0
applications. Secure design and implementation of Web 2.0 applications
starts with a plan for adoption of software security activities as part of
the SDLC. Essential software security activities include the documentation
of secure coding requirements for Web 2.0 such as for AJAX, secure design
and review of Web 2.0 architectures, manual/automatic secure code
reviews/analysis and security testing. Security testing need to target both
Web 2.0 client/desktop components (e.g. FLASH, RIA, mashups) as well as
server components/functionality (e.g. Web services). Finally, the third step
includes managing the business risks that Web 2.0 design flaws and bugs
might pose to the business. The OWASP risk methodology and a web 2.0 risk
framework is proposed as methodology to analyze and manage Web 2.0 security
risks. A simple example on how to integrate with Web 2.0 technology securely
such as a twitter interface to a web site, it is also presented.

Pizza will be offered to all participants.

As usual, if you are not a OWASP member yet, please plan to join.

Dear fellow OWASP local members and meeting attendees

 

Thanks for your participation to the meeting today.  We had a good number of
people attending and hope that the presentation was interesting. 

 

I have archived my presentation that can be downloaded from the OWASP
chapter page herein:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#November_Meeting

 

Some of you asked me where you can order the OWASP books, the site is
http://www.lulu.com

just search for OWASP

 

Another question was regarding the OWASP membership:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Why_Should_I_Become_An_OWASP_Membe
r_or_Organization_Supporter

I had a couple of questions after the meeting  that I will follow up through
the emailing list, such as:

.         Recommended list of device fingerprinting tools like IOvation,
RSA/Cyota etc

.         Free application scanner tools

.         Measures against ZeuS and banking Trojan attacks assuming
compromise

 

If anyone of the list subscribers has recommendations on these please feel
free to email back.

In the mean time, wish you happy thanksgiving holidays!
