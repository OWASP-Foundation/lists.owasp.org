Well the new year is upon us and we are ready to kick off another year of
great OWASP chapter meetings.  I hope that everyone had a great holiday
season and that you are off to a great new year. 

 

We will have our first meeting of the year on Thursday 01/26/12 from 12:00 -
1:30 PM.  Our speakers will be John Steven and Jason Rouse of Cigital and
they will be talking to us about Mobile security and assessments. 

 

Please go to our Eventbrite page and register.  :

mail&utm_campaign=new_eventv2&utm_term=eventurl_text>
http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2796437219 Please make sure that if you are
planning on attending that you register so that Security at Citi will be
prepared for your attendance. It speeds up the sign in process and makes
life easier for the Security team at Citi.

 

We will be having pizza and drinks so you don't need to worry about getting
lunch either before or after the meeting. 

 

We will be reaching out to all of you soon with more information about
upcoming meetings for and we are putting together a survey that we will be
asking you to complete.

 

Hope to see you on the 26th.

 

Regards,

I have not been particularly active since I started working in Dayton, nearly 2 years ago.  None the less, I would hate to think that this chapter can't outlive Marco's relocation.

What say you?

Hey Jamie,

Not sure what you are referring to. We have met 2 off the 3 months since
Marco left and we have a meeting this Thursday. I have not had a chance to
update the website but did send out a email and Eventbrite last week. Here
is the link of you can make it.

Sorry Andy!  I was obviously a bit ill informed.  I was speaking only from what I saw on the web site.  I'm not sure why, but I have not seen the recent invitation.  My junk mail filter seems to be catching some, but not all, owasp.org email, which might explain it.  I've corrected that.

At any rate, I am glad to see I was confused and I will make every effort to attend this week's event.  Mobile security is a very hot topic for me (and everyone in the industry, I suppose).

I didn't see the e-mail about this month's meeting either.  Could someone
update the web site with the 2012 schedule?

I will be updating the site soon. Work and life have been very hectic
lately and we have had a couple of last minute cancellations and changes
that have impacted the schedule. We have most of it nailed down now through
June.
