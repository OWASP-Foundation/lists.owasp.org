dear list

Some communication for you:
November Meeting :thanks again for you all (about 20 people) that participated to last November chapter meeting.  
Considering we where just two days before thanksgiving vacation that was not bad!
Thanks to Foundstone, the presentation can be found herein: http://www.foundstone.com/us/resources/owasp_cincinnati_nov.pdf
An updated link is provided on our chapter web page.

December Meeting: We will not have a presentation on December due to the coming festivities. 
I plan a get together for a drink,  talk about your interests for OWASP in 09 and exchange Merry Christmas and good wishes.
I put tentatively down Wednesday Dec 17 or Thursday the 18th  5.30-7 PM at Bravo in Mason. 
Let me know what works best for you. If you prefer another location/restaurant let me know.
If you are interested please send me a note.

Incoming January 09 Presentation:  The next meeting is planned on Friday January 9th, Russ McMahon , UC Professor will talk about Threat Analysis and Modeling. Russ plan to cover the use of the recently released Microsoft TAM tool. For the one of you that are interested to a practical use of threat modeling tools to design secure applications this is a presnetation not to miss.

2009 Presentation Calendar: I am putting down a calendar of presentations for 09. The plan is to have a presenter on the bi-monthly basis and meet informally the other months. If you are interested to pledge a presentation for 2009 or you are interested on a specific topic please let me know. 
 
OWASP Membership Drive: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership Kicking off Jan 2009 - Dec 2009, funds are donated with a 60/40 split. 60% of the raised funds would go towards OWASP Foundation operations, grant projects, events, global committee budgets etc., and 40% of the funds would be ear-marked for our local OWASP chapter. I am looking for local companies interested to sponsor our next year activities. It will be nice to expense educational materials such as OWASP books that we can distribute to our local list members. Maybe allocate some funding for one-day conference will be great too.

With all enough said, thanks again for your participation and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and your families.

Sincerely

Marco Morana
