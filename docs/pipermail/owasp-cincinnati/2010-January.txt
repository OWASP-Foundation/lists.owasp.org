List

 

First: a reminder to RSVP to the next meeting by registering on
<http://owasp-cincy.eventbrite.com/> http://owasp-cincy.eventbrite.com/

I hope to see the number to tickets issue raised to a good number, right now
is about 10, hope to get more to RSVP next week

 

Second: I have a pleasure to announce the OWASP calendar for 2010. We have
first caliber speakers and good mix of application security topics.

 I hope this will make your participation and attendance to the chapter even
more interesting.

Please check the calendar herein
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#2010_Meetings_Calendar 

I kindly ask you to mark your outlook or Google calendars with this meetings

 

Third: We need to spread the word about these meeting. You can start with
your colleagues/students/clients. I need to guarantee a good participation.
My expectation is that at least 25 active members participate to the
meetings about of 100 subscribers of the list.  

On my side I will coordinate with  other security groups such as ISACA and
ISSA to make sure we know about each other presentation so we can give both
the speakers and the talks good attention.

 

Fourth: I encourage any contribution you might want to give to the local
OWASP chapter, financial and non. Please become a member if you believe in
OWASP! Our mailing list can be used for start discussions on security topics
you would like to share experiences or just gather feedback from the
security professionals in our area. Please use the mailing list!

 

Fifth: I am looking for volunteers to help me with the logistics such as
managing the RSVPs and do some PR for OWASP  meeting announcements on
newspaper, local tech groups, linkedin, facebook etc. 

 

Together we can make this chapter an active contributor to raise security
awareness and education for the local community here in Cincinnati

 

Thank you

Looks like a great year Marco, thanks for organizing it.

Suggestion:

On the owasp home page there is an embedded google calendar with the
Cincinnati events in it. The event times listed on this calendar are
different from the eventbright invite that was distributed.

It looks like this is a single calendar. If there was a Cincinnati
calendar then that could be shared? It would be much easier for us to
add a calendar than copy/past the events from the wiki plus it makes
it auto updated if dates/times change. The main owasp embedded
calendar can include events from multiple calendars so it would still
work the same way.

Volunteers:

I will be continuing to push the word out about the OWASP meetings but
if you want to get some volunteers together to organize a coordinated
strike I would love to be involved.

You mentioned local tech-groups. I think this is the most effective
avenue for getting the OWASP word to developers. Last year the group
touched on the idea of an "OWASP Outreach" program that might ensure
that the user groups both know about OWASP and can include security
bulletins and presentations into their meetings. Perhaps this is
another topic for your volunteer group to come up with a plan for.

One of the big things that happened last year was the creation of the
TechLife Cincinnati Meet-up group. OWASP should be involved with this
group since in attracts all the leaders of all the user groups in
town. Even advertising the events on the group site may attract
developers.

Ed

Thanks for your suggestions, thanks for the time catch up. I think the one
on OWASP has different times since is set on GMT when you save them, that
makes it weird. I will change by entering in GMT time -5 EST.

I can create an OWASP Google calendar for Cincinnati eventually. 

Techlife group meet up can also be a good opportunity 

Thanks

Marco

I added the Jan 27 meeting to the tech life group. Marco, you should
have access to change any details you like.

    http://www.meetup.com/TechLife-Cincinnati/calendar/12345545/

Since the meetup service suppots RSVPs, this might be an easier way to
integrate advertizing and responding into one place as opposed to
using the eventbright solution.

If you like the contents then we can copy this meeting definition to
the other dates for the year.

I added the Jan 27 meeting to the tech life group. Marco, you should
have access to change any details you like.

    http://www.meetup.com/TechLife-Cincinnati/calendar/12345545/

Since the meetup service suppots RSVPs, this might be an easier way to
integrate advertizing and responding into one place as opposed to
using the eventbright solution.

If you like the contents then we can copy this meeting definition to
the other dates for the year.

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] FW: OWASP for Charities:  Haiti relief effort
Message-ID: <4b56f8d9.9553f10a.6c9f.626f@mx.google.com>

OWASP Members and Supporters,

OWASP was founded, and is supported as a non-profit organization, by a group
of dedicated volunteers who believe that all applications should be secure
and trusted.  As our organization matures we have taken those beliefs
broader, and have started setting up ways for our members to donate to the
global community.  Among these initiatives are: 

*	OWASP has an active Kiva lending team who have donated $9,125.00 to
date.  http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522
*	OWASP in response to the need in Haiti has set up a secure and
trusted way for those within the OWASP community to donate funds to help the
people of Haiti. This allows our OWASP community to help another with a
single global voice.  100% of the collected donations will be transferred
directly to victims for disaster relief such as food and medical
requirements.  Please visit www.owasp.org and click the link for
G33k-4-HAITI.  In a time of crisis, OWASP can help those who are in great
need. The OWASP community can help organize, support , and promote efforts
outside of application security.

OWASP is well aware there is a movement for phishers to utilize this tragedy
to get unsuspecting people to donate to a "cause" without having a
legitimate business back end and ultimately funneling all the money directly
into their own pockets.  The OWASP community is uniquely qualified to help
protect from this type of attack and educate about attacks as well.

As the world becomes more dependent on technology and particularly web
applications, there are many who need protection who simply have no options
to protect themselves.  These include small companies, individuals,
charities, and others.  The OWASP community can help by connecting
qualified, trusted resources willing to volunteer their time to those
organizations which qualify. OWASP is setting up an outreach program, which
will be under the name project name of OWASP for Charities.  

We hope you will support OWASPs efforts to make a difference  in any of the
above ways. We are also open to suggestions in regards to where you feel the
OWASP Community can be of service.

Regards,

Your OWASP Board

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Chinese Hack on Google and Zero-Day Released
	Vulnerability in IE 6 on XP, 2000
Message-ID: <4b5b1a5d.47c1f10a.2952.2990@mx.google.com>

List

 

May be most of you notice the news about the Chinese attack on Google.
Apparently this attack was taking advantage of an IE6 un-disclosed exploit
(but known to MS vulnerabilities) on desktop running XP. When the exploit
was released and the metasploit attack method, the risk was rated critical
since allowed for a desktop running XP to be compromised.
http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/01/18/google-exploit-leaked-internet-sec
urity-experts-urge-vigilance/

 

The risk prompted both German and France government CERTS to issue an alert
not to use IE at all
https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_183/ContentBSI/presse/Pressemitteilungen/Sicherh
eitsluecke_IE_150110.html

with translation here:

r/

 

MS released an Advisory first and a special out of band patch last Thursday.

You can look at Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-002 - Critical also 

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/979352.mspxhttp://blogs.t
echnet.com/srd/

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-002.mspx

 

The patch can be automatically be downloaded with Windows update

http://www.update.microsoft.com

 

In my opinion, the best practice for the future would probably  use Firefox
for everyday browsing or upgrade to IE8/Vista/WIN7

 

Continue to use IE 6/on XP-2000 only if you have to browse old internal web
sites that does not support new browsers.
