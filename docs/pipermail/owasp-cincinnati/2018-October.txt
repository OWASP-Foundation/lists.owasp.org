*Abstract*

Data Governance is at the center of the Data Management world. What
connects Data Governance to business success?
Data Leadership. Attend this talk to learn why.


Data people often feel like they are on the outside looking in. It seems
like our businesses can?t get out of their own way, and if they would just
LISTEN to us, we could help them right the ship. This breakdown in
communications is the result of decades of poor organizational design and
countless inefficient interactions between business and technology folks,
with whom data people are inevitably linked. But now that our data
technologies have become unbelievably powerful, the need to change has
become even more pronounced.



Data Governance has long been our answer to solving these challenges, but
many Data Governance efforts lose momentum over time, and ultimately fail.

We can do better, and Data Leadership will help us achieve it. We must
teach our data folks to become better leaders, and our leaders to better
understand data ? and everybody how to get the most value from data. This
talk is a step in that unifying direction.

Highlights:

?       See the language of leadership in action

?       Hear from a former CDO about what executives care about most

?       Learn the Data Leadership Framework to maximize real data value
outcomes

?       Get stories from the trenches of Data Leadership in action

?       Gain some new insights about where you can take your career
