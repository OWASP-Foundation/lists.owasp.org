<PRE>Hi Everyone,

meeting next Tuesday the 12th at the Citi building in Blue Ash from 12:00
-1:30.   Details are below.

IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL SO I CAN PLAN
ACCORDINGLY FOR PIZZA AND BUILDING ACCESS.

Hope to see you there.

Developing a Software Security Assurance Program

For decades technology has been an obvious key to competitive advantage
across nearly every industry. Whether organizations develop new technology
in-house or leverage third-party solutions, software vulnerabilities
provide another attack vector for cyber criminals. Organizations are
reacting by developing a software security initiative to manage the risks
related to software vulnerabilities.

This session will review some of the latest emerging industry practices in
managing software security risks, including application penetration
testing, static code analysis, software security testing, vendor
assessments, security architecture reviews and developer training.

Speaker

Kabir Mulchandani is a Managing Principal at Cigital. He has more than 17
years of experience in information security and management consulting.
Kabir has expertise in developing and managing information security risk
management, vendor management, software security assurance and Governance,
Risk and Control (GRC) programs.  Kabir leads Cigital&#8217;s Mid-Atlantic
practice and focuses on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of
software security programs.

Thanks,

Andy Willingham
