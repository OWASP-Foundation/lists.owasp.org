<PRE>Happy Fall!

 

I hope all of you are doing well and enjoying the fall weather that we are
finally starting to see. We have a meeting planned for later this month that
I wanted to make you aware of. 

 

We will meet on Tuesday Oct 25th from 12:00 - 1:30 at TEKsystems in
Rookwood. 

Rookwood Exchange Building, 3825 Edwards Road, Second Floor Conference Room,
Cincinnati, Ohio ***All Parking is FREE***

 

Additionally TEKsystems is sponsoring the meeting and buying lunch and it's
NOT PIZZA!!!!! Pizza is great but it will be nice to have something
different. They are providing sandwiches from Potbelly so make sure you
register early so we will know how many to expect and have enough for
everyone.


So who is speaking? Our very own Allison Shubert will be presenting on RASP.
What is RASP you ask? We'll let Allison tell you in her own words.

The information security space is run amok with security products.  We often
walk a fine line between security and application functionality and
services.  We look for a one size fits all solution, but because the
software development lifecycle (SDLC) has several phases which require a
unique security controls there is no silver bullet.  Consequently, we are
always looking for creative and innovative ways to solve the dilemma of
building secure software applications.  

 

This presentation will navigate through the security alphabet soup and
discuss the various technologies required to build a secure application,
thus illustrating that there is no silver bullet.  However, there may be a
silver lining in an emerging technology called runtime application
self-protection (RASP).  RASP promises to bridge gaps in a never ending
wheel spinning cycle of the find and fix vulnerabilities mentality.  

 

We will examine the pros and cons to using RASP technology as we lay out the
rational and use cases for the nascent technology.

 

Here is the link to the Eventbrite page for you to register. We will be
closing registration a few days early this time so we can get a head count
to TEKsystems for lunch so register early!
