This came from someone in the OWASP Global Office and I wanted to pass it along. There is an opportunity for Python developers to help out someone doing research and earn a little money in return. They are offering a $50 Amazon gift card to those who will complete the survey and a short questionnaire.

Details below if you are interested.
