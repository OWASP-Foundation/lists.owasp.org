I hope all of you are well and are ready to get back into the swing of
things with OWASP. Since things went a little crazy last month and we ended
up not meeting we will double up this month.

Our regularly scheduled meeting is Wednesday the 10th from noon to 1:30. We
will meet at Citi in Blue Ash as usual. Our speaker is Rohit SethI off SD
Elements. Rohit will present on "Is there an end to testing ourselves
secure".  SD Elements will also be sponsoring the meeting so remember to
thank them for lunch. You can find more details at the Eventbrite page
where you will need to register; http://Cincy_owasp_10-10-12.eventbrite.com.
Also check our OWASP site for details.

The following week we will be joining forces with the Cincinnati ISSA
chapter to welcome Jeff Williams of Aspect Security to town. Jeff is a
appsec guru and on of the early OWASP leaders. More details, including how
to register can be found at

This meeting will not be held at Citi but will be in Amelia, Oh.

I hope to see y'all at one or both of these events.

Have a great week
