TITLE: Security is Dead. Love Live Rugged DevOps: IT at Ludicrous Speed

ABSTRACT:

Cloud IT velocity is breathtaking: while most IT struggle with monthly
releases, agile IT businesses routinely conjure thousands of AWS servers,
performing over 10 deploys per day. This agility delights the business and
terrifies security. DevOps aligns the former adversaries of Dev and Ops.
Security needs to enable ludicrous speed or be left behind. We make a case
for Rugged DevOps as an answer.

Group following his time as Principal Security Strategist for IBM Internet
Security Systems. Mr. Corman&#8217;s research highlights adversaries, game theory
and motivational structures. His analysis cuts across sectors to the core
security challenges plaguing the IT industry, and helps to drive
evolutionary strategies toward emerging technologies and shifting
incentives. His research and education efforts won him the title of Top
Influencer of IT by NetworkWold magazine in 2009. Mr. Corman is a candid

Kappa and summa cum laude, from the University of New Hampshire. He resides
with his wife and two daughters in New Hampshire.
