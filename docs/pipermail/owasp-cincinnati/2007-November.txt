Hi,

I am glad to release sqlmap 0.5; sqlmap is an automatic SQL injection
tool entirely developed in Python. It is capable to perform an extensive
database management system back-end fingerprint, retrieve remote DBMS
databases, usernames, tables, columns, enumerate entire DBMS, read
system files and much more taking advantage of web application
programming security flaws that lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Regarding Certification:

 

You (OWASP) only get one chance at this. If we do this too soon (not enough
structure, roles and repsonsabilities, budget) and it fails  we wont get
another chance or be taken to seriously.

 

Lets learn to consolidate our gains and walk for a while prior to running.

>From OWASP Turkey Chapter,

 

1)      Certification is not required. It requires lots of resources and
it's way too commercial.

2)       Apache Foundation is a good example but also we believe OWASP
should not turn into a software development based organization.

3)       -

4)       Only "members" should pay money, not project leaders and chapter
leaders. Requesting money from chapter leaders or project leader is
unacceptable. Since they already spent lots of their time for OWASP. 

5)       Current state of OWASP is quite all right. Making it more formal
potentially not going to work and even in this state lots of chapters and
chapter leaders are not active enough. Getting more formal is not going to
help it either. 

6)       There are some recommendations:

a.        Generally we want changes, it's good. 

b.       Active chapters should be supported more and we should start to
eliminate inactive chapters. 


And it's in the wiki as well.


Cheers,

A really well funded community where open source ethos is still at the heart

of the project but it operates like a company or maybe more accurately
mini-country. An eCountry! Produce software, guidance, certification that 
all works together and compliments each other. This will be key to avoiding 
just a mass of stuff that's good but confusing. A roadmap and project plan
would be a good way to help this.  Consciously focus / force path on 
software security and not just web app pen testing. Focus on what matters 
and not just on what skill set is available. Engage the software security
people and banks / telcos / gov etc. Lobby in-justice (PCI-DSS), publically 
set right bs marketing FUD. Continue to make it fun for people to

Some random thoughts:

* I think we should continue along the path we are on right now and
strengthen our positions. Continue to grow the network of Chapters, 
work on our conferences, and so on. Increase quality before expanding
to new venues.

* I also very much like the organisation of the Apache Foundation.

* We need to introduce concept of project incubation, minimal criteria 
required for a project to officially become an OWASP project.

* I like the idea of certification but I don't think we are ready at
this point. Also, this is an effort that needs to be handled
professionally by full-time staff. 

* As I said before, I think whoever wants to be called a member needs
to pay for it. Perhaps we could waive the fees for certain individuals
after the first year. Also, the last time I looked the entry level 
fees for organisations were too high for very small business (e.g.
independent security consultants).

Hi,

OWASP Books have arrived. I was really surprised how cool and professional
our work looks when it gets printed up.  There are books for Building Guide,
Testing Guide, CLASP, WebScarab/WebGoat, and lots more.  Feel free to
forward Tom's announcement to your chapter/project lists.  Thanks!

GOT OWASP BOOKS?

Many of you have read the wiki used the OWASP published materials as
guides such as the Top 10 Guide, Testing Guide, CLASP for lifecyle and
many others

That may work for some of us g33ks however management likes to kill trees
(well not all of them right..) but like a hard copy printed book as a
"blueprint" of how something should be done or as a ref., or to give to a
employee and say "read this"

Well OWASP has done just that - all our books are now hardcopy published!

I am pleased to announce to the NYC Metro local chapter and shortly it
will be announced to the world of OWASP Books online - so order now before
the holiday rush ;)

Now you can get a professional bound book that you can give away to your
managers,developers,pen testers,audit department to help spread the word.

Online bookstore = http://stores.lulu.com/owasp

Shirts hats etc... http://www.cafepress.com/owasp

If you forget the links you can always go back to the wiki at
http://www.owasp.org to find them.

Dinis is also working on a buy a book, plant a tree program since we are
in a GREEN World ;)
