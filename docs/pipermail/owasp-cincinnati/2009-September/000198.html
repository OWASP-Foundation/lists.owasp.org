I've given a few security talks at user groups and they have been well
received.  I think this type of outreach is a good idea for OWASP.

Thanks for the link.   I had wished that Cincinnati had something like
Portland's Calagator--their user groups got together and wrote an open
source web app to track their combined events.  It's at
