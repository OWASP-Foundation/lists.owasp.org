Presentation Abstract 

The internet has become a phenomenal means for companies to conduct high
volume, low cost transactions with customers from around the globe. It has
reduced internal system and application costs through Saas and Paas and
offers even great savings and efficiencies as cloud computing environments
mature and deploy in greater volume. However, with the growing volume and
wealth of transactions moving through and being stored on the World-Wide
Web, Internet transactional security is now a critical concern for both
consumers and companies alike. The volume of fraudulent transactions,
incidents of invasion and cyber crime are all accelerating. According to
both information security experts and law enforcement officials, these
attacks are almost always the work of organized and well-financed criminal
organizations. Hear Verdasys President and Co-Founder, Nicholas Stamos
explain real world strategies for combating these growing threats and
discuss processes that when put in place can offer true protection for your
company and customers against the ever evolving world cyber threats.
