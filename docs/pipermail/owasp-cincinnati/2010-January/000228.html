<PRE>OWASP Members and Supporters,

OWASP was founded, and is supported as a non-profit organization, by a group
of dedicated volunteers who believe that all applications should be secure
and trusted.  As our organization matures we have taken those beliefs
broader, and have started setting up ways for our members to donate to the
global community.  Among these initiatives are: 

*	OWASP has an active Kiva lending team who have donated $9,125.00 to
date.  <A HREF="http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522">http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522</A>
*	OWASP in response to the need in Haiti has set up a secure and
trusted way for those within the OWASP community to donate funds to help the
people of Haiti. This allows our OWASP community to help another with a
single global voice.  100% of the collected donations will be transferred
directly to victims for disaster relief such as food and medical
requirements.  Please visit www.owasp.org and click the link for
G33k-4-HAITI.  In a time of crisis, OWASP can help those who are in great
need. The OWASP community can help organize, support , and promote efforts
outside of application security.

OWASP is well aware there is a movement for phishers to utilize this tragedy
to get unsuspecting people to donate to a &quot;cause&quot; without having a
legitimate business back end and ultimately funneling all the money directly
into their own pockets.  The OWASP community is uniquely qualified to help
protect from this type of attack and educate about attacks as well.

As the world becomes more dependent on technology and particularly web
applications, there are many who need protection who simply have no options
to protect themselves.  These include small companies, individuals,
charities, and others.  The OWASP community can help by connecting
qualified, trusted resources willing to volunteer their time to those
organizations which qualify. OWASP is setting up an outreach program, which
will be under the name project name of OWASP for Charities.  

We hope you will support OWASPs efforts to make a difference  in any of the
above ways. We are also open to suggestions in regards to where you feel the
OWASP Community can be of service.

Regards,

Your OWASP Board
