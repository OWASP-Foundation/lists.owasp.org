<PRE>Looks like a great year Marco, thanks for organizing it.

Suggestion:

On the owasp home page there is an embedded google calendar with the
Cincinnati events in it. The event times listed on this calendar are
different from the eventbright invite that was distributed.

It looks like this is a single calendar. If there was a Cincinnati
calendar then that could be shared? It would be much easier for us to
add a calendar than copy/past the events from the wiki plus it makes
it auto updated if dates/times change. The main owasp embedded
calendar can include events from multiple calendars so it would still
work the same way.

Volunteers:

I will be continuing to push the word out about the OWASP meetings but
if you want to get some volunteers together to organize a coordinated
strike I would love to be involved.

You mentioned local tech-groups. I think this is the most effective
avenue for getting the OWASP word to developers. Last year the group
touched on the idea of an &quot;OWASP Outreach&quot; program that might ensure
that the user groups both know about OWASP and can include security
bulletins and presentations into their meetings. Perhaps this is
another topic for your volunteer group to come up with a plan for.

One of the big things that happened last year was the creation of the
TechLife Cincinnati Meet-up group. OWASP should be involved with this
group since in attracts all the leaders of all the user groups in
town. Even advertising the events on the group site may attract
developers.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;I hope this will make your participation and attendance to the chapter even

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Third: We need to spread the word about these meeting. You can start with
</I>&gt;<i> your colleagues/students/clients. I need to guarantee a good participation.
</I>&gt;<i> My expectation is that at least 25 active members participate to the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On my side I will coordinate with &#160;other security groups such as ISACA and
</I>&gt;<i> ISSA to make sure we know about each other presentation so we can give both
</I>&gt;<i> the speakers and the talks good attention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fourth: I encourage any contribution you might want to give to the local
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP chapter, financial and non. Please become a member if you believe in
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP! Our mailing list can be used for start discussions on security topics
</I>&gt;<i> you would like to share experiences or just gather feedback from the
</I>&gt;<i> security professionals in our area. Please use the mailing list!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fifth: I am looking for volunteers to help me with the logistics such as
</I>&gt;<i> managing the RSVPs and do some PR for OWASP &#160;meeting announcements on
</I>&gt;<i> newspaper, local tech groups, linkedin, facebook etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Together we can make this chapter an active contributor to raise security
</I>&gt;<i> awareness and education for the local community here in Cincinnati
