OWASP Cincinnati Chapter November Meeting
--------------------------------------------------------

WHEN: November 25th TIME TBD (Possibly 12:00-1.30 PM)

WHAT: Web App Hacking for Developers with Jeremiah Blatz (Foundstone Consultant)
How safe are your web applications? You'll think twice after seeing
how Foundstone security experts dig into their hacker's toolbox and
rip open web applications by exploiting simple software bugs. Common
problems such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection will be
demonstrated and explained, along with more subtle vulnerabilities
including privilege escalation, data tampering, and Cross-Site Request
Forgery. Even if you've seen XSS and SQL Injection before, advanced
techniques will be presented that can slip through many protections.
As a finale, the holy grail of web security will be broken with a
Man-In-The-Middle attack on SSL. Countermeasures to prevent mistakes
will then be shared. Updated schedule for the presentation is included
herein: http://www.foundstone.com/us/company-events.asp

Full details/agenda @ https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati

WHERE: Citibank 9997 Carver Road, Bldg. 1, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45242-5537

 ** REGISTER BY RSVP EMAIL BEFORE NOVEMBER 23 **

I met Ford in Rochester where I presented on threat modeling and he
told me about his presentation at OWASP NY
It is actually on google now here:

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7209323310151363553&hl=en

With the fun comes also the scaring part is how much money you can
make easy by exploiting web application design flaws...

This is a call to go back to threat model web apps and test before is too late

Regards

Marco

dear OWASP list

frankly I am little surprised on the few RSVPs to the OWASP meeting next week.
Not sure this is a lack of interest or just bad schedule for the event
before thanksgiving vacation.

We have a consultant from McAfee traveling to Cincinnati for giving us
a nice presentation for free and I put mine and OWASP reputation at
stake.

If you could not come at least I kindly ask you to let your
colleagues/friends know about the event (*).
I would like to show that we are worth the consideration we deserve as
Cincinnati solid security tech community.

Thanks and sorry for being a little blunt

Marco
