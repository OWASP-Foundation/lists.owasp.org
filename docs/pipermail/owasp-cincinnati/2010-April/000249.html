Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure Your Business
Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors &amp; Data 

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries,
it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and
security of the software running its business critical applications. As a
result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent
attack vector used by hackers. Whether you manage internal development
activities, work with third party developers or are developing a COTS
application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and
make applications security a priority for internal and external development
teams. In this session we will cover; (1) Prevalence of backdoors and
malicious code in third party attacks; (2) Definitions and classifications
of backdoors and their impact on your applications; (3) Methods to identify,
track and remediate these vulnerabilities
