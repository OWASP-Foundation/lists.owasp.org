Abstract: Measuring Your Proactive Security Efforts

Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high intensity weight
training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate goal is often
clear, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently make is to
overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting progress. Like a
successful bodybuilding workout, a security development lifecycle program
must consistently log simple to obtain, yet meaningful metrics throughout
the entire process. Good metrics must lack subjectivity and clearly aid
decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In this pragmatic
presentation we'll discuss metrics used at Symantec, the world's largest
security ISV, to classify and appropriately compare security vulnerabilities
found in different phases of the SDL by different teams working in different
locations and in different products. We'll also discuss how to easily
provide decision makers different views of the same data and verify whether
the process is indeed catching critical vulnerabilities internally and how
the numbers compare with the competition
