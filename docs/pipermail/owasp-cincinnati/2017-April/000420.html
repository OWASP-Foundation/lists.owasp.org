<PRE>Happy Friday! I hope all of you are doing well. It was great seeing some of you yesterday at our April meeting. I hope you enjoyed the talk and information provided by Altaz from Security Compass.

I wanted to remind you of a couple of things that are happening. First, as i mentioned last week we now have a Facebook page that I'm using to share information about the chapter and news that I find to be interesting and think you would as well. Feel free to jump in and join the conversation there.

Also on May 24th there is a new IT/IS conference coming to Cincinnati. The Interface Conference is a one day event where topics related to IT/IS will be highlighted. There will be talks, round tables, and opportunities to network. It is free to IT professionals and you can earn up to 6.5 CPE credits to apply to any certifications that you may have. You can find more information and register here, www.interfacetour.com/evites/cin/owasp.htm (<A HREF="http://www.interfacetour.com/evites/cin/owasp.htm">http://www.interfacetour.com/evites/cin/owasp.htm</A>)

We are making plans for our next meeting most likely in June. More information will be provided as we get the details finalized.

We are looking for your ideas on topics and speakers for upcoming meetings. If you have something that you think would be a good topic for us to address let us know. If you would like to speak or know someone who would be interested let us know. Also, if you have heard someone at another venue or conference that you would like for us to try and get here let us know.

Be safe and we will see you around town.
