On behalf of the Cincinnati chapter I would like to thank you for the
allocation to 40% of the IOActive corporate sponsorship to the Cincinnati
chapter. These extra funds (currently $ 500) of the $ 1,500 already
allocated for sponsoring our event in March will help to support our OWASP
chapter meeting with catering/food as well as other needs (e.g.
documentation material, T-shirts for presenters)

 

As OWASP Cincinnati chapter leader, I thank IOActive for the support and
look forward working with you to other initiatives, events and projects

 

Thanks

 

Marco Morana
