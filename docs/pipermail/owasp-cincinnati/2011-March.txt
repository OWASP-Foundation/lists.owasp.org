Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Thank You For Your Participation, Site Up To Date,
	RSVP for Next Week Meeting
Message-ID: <4d6f91c7.1192e60a.20fb.2b9a@mx.google.com>

Dear OWASP and cincy list members,

 

Thanks for your active participation to the last chapter meetings. We had
averaged 25-30 people attending at each meeting since January that is very
good indeed.

 

I have uploaded the February presentation on Cloud Security on the chapter
web site, please check out.

It will be nice to have a follow up on the topics discussed to see what you
think about Cloud security how will impact your security business/work in
the future.

 

IOActive presentation was also very well received and raised a lot of
questions. It was nice to see the ATM hack live for the first time as remote
from Erlanger to Seattle.  Just need an IP address and port and them boom,
you have ATM rootkit uploaded, pretty amazing staff.

 

I also hope you enjoyed the nice dinner we had, I thought quality of the
food was outstanding, thanks to the sponsorship with IOActive and the
logistics of METS center.

 

Just the heads up, next meeting is march 9th in Blue Ash, we have Jeremiah
Grossman Cot and founder of whitehat security to talk about vulnerability
assessments, it is a great opportunity to know more about application
vulnerabilities and best practices from the experience of 400 companies
doing it.

 

Please RSVP if you have not done it already.

Also think to become OWASP member and be active contributor to the
organization. 

 

Through OWASP, there are a lot of things we can accomplish together and for
the local security community in Cincinnati.

 

Thanks a lot for your follow up on the meetings and participation, look
forward to see you next Wednesday

 

Regards

 

Marco Morana

Folks

 

Thanks for your attendance to the last meeting. I thought the presentation
was very well received and raised a lot of good discussion and insightful
questions. Nevertheless, the attendance to the meeting is not near how
should have been. I had 34 people RSVP and less than half showed up, for the
rest I am thankful to Citi's colleague of mine that show up 5 of them. This
is not really good also for the vendor that sponsored the event and did pay
for catering for the original list. Moving forward, please only RSVP if you
are attending, if you do not please send an email that you won't so this
will help me and the sponsor.

 

That being said, I am looking forward to your participation again. I would
also like to thank you all the people that are keenly interested on OWASP by
showing up every meeting and the ones that pledged membership to the chapter

 

With best regards 

 

Marco Morana
