<PRE>Hello OWASP Community,

The OWASP AppSec USA 2011 conference in Minneapolis is only two weeks away.
Classes are filling up fast (the OWASP WTE class is full), and the
conference talks lineup is impressive. Sign up today for the training on
September 20-21 and the main conference talks, CTF, showroom, and Open
Source Showcase on September 22-23!

OWASP is in its tenth year, and application security is on everyone's radar.
And this year we have some wonderful new initiatives as part of OWASP AppSec
USA 2011. For the first time, we're:

* Funding the conference experience for two women in college through the
OWASP Women in AppSec grant. Congratulations to Tara Wilson and Chandni
Bhowmik on securing these grants! And thank you to The Wells Fargo
Foundation for its generous seed funding.

* Raising funds for science education for inner city youth with the 5K/10K
for Charity.

* Hosting a University Challenge offense/defense competition.

* Running an Open Source Showcase during the conference proceedings. Open
source community members will demo their awesome work.

Additionally, the OWASP Chapters Committee and the ESAPI and AppSensor teams
will be meeting September 21 to build upon their great work in OWASP.

Be a part of AppSec USA 2011, where OWASP propels itself into the next ten
years. Lots of cool talks and training. And many opportunities to learn,
grow, and give back.

We would like to thank the OWASP AppSec USA 2011 donors and sponsors and the
many conference contributors for helping us to build an awesome event for
the application security and development community.
