<PRE>Dear fellow OWASP members

 

We had 53 people registered for the event Saturday! That's great news, thank
you all for enrolling. I also appreciate the PR work that NKU has done. 

 

We have still one day for RSVP so if you have not done it yet please do.

<A HREF="http://owasp-cincy-september.eventbrite.com/">http://owasp-cincy-september.eventbrite.com/</A>

 

This is a unique opportunity to hear a talk on software security from one of
thought leaders in security and the founder of software security discipline
himself.

 

I would like also to announce the new chapter leader, Andy Wayne Willingham.


 

Andy used to be the chapter leader of InfoGard in Atlanta. He currently
resides in Cincinnati and is colleague of mine at Citigroup where he is
Business Info. Security Officer of eBusiness.

 

I worked with Andy at Citi and I estimate him a lot for this security
knowledge and capability to lead Infosec initiatives. I am sure the OWASP
chapter will be well served by Andy. 

 

It is sad for me to relinquish my role as OWASP Cincinnati chapter leader
but I have to due to a career change that will take me away from Cincinnati
unfortunately, a city that I truly love very much. 

 

Well, I would also like to thank you for your support over these years and
also for enthusiastically participate to our chapter meetings. 

 

Since the chapter started in 2008 we grew up to 150 people  and we were able
to conduct monthly meeting and attracting very good speakers.  I hope that
you commitment to attend the meetings will continue in the years to come and
if you are not an OWASP member to become one. This is a fantastic
organization to be member to.

 

For the event Saturday, I will be there for checking in at 9 AM, breakfast
starts 9.30 offered by NKU book signing (bring your Secure Coding copy) at
10.00 AM. Gary's talks starts at 10.30AM till 11.30 EST

 

I hope to see you at NKU Saturday so we can enjoy together the OWASP-NKU
event.

 

With best regards

 

Marco Morana

OWASP chapter lead

</PRE>
