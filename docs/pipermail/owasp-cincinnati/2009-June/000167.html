<PRE>List

this is the WHID report and the analysis of  2008. IIt is interesting because it takes into account the attacker motives that is a threat agent factor in the threat analysis.
Also provides metrics on the most used vulnerabilities for the attacke motives and the most popular targets (e.g. companies, organizations) for the attacks.

The June presentation will cover the first six months of 2009 with a slightly different analysis more targeting the type of attacks and impact (e.g. top compromise outcomes) as well as target factors by geography and market.

Hope this is useful
