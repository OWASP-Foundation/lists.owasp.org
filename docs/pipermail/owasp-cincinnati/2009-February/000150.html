<PRE>Cincy OWASP Attendees

we had a good follow up of the discussion at the last meeting and thanks for your participation
I have included herein the forum presentation. 

I have contacted the authors of the presentation to check if I can have the original presentation uploaded on the site.
To help the video quality, probably the next Forum format I will try to use the original presentation and synchronize with a stream audio.

I will follow up with Jamie questions about IDS filer evasion technique used in one of the attacks and Gudla on open source tools.

Cheers
