<PRE>Folks

 

I was hoping for a larger attendance to the last meeting, not sure it was
for my late announcement (sorry for that) or for the lack of interest on the
subject, maybe both?

 

 We had approximately 10 people that over a list of 80 potential attendees
(current list subscribers) does not shine as good participation.

 

Anyways, the few that attended seemed to like the presentation and the
video. For all of you I have put together a summary of the presentation's
main points. If you watch the video and go over the slides I think helps to
clarify especially I put some emphasis on countermeasures that was implicit
in the presentation.

 

For the next time, I would appreciate if you could please let me know if
there is anything I can do to encourage participation such as time schedule,
location, topics etc

 

Regards

 

Marco
