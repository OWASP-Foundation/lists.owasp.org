Happy Fall! It may feel more like winter than fall but hopefully in a day or so we will actually get some fall weather.

We will meet on Tuesday Nov 14th for our final meeting of the year. I?d like to say Thanks to both NovaCoast for sponsoring the meeting and providing the speaker and to PayCor for hosting us again.

I?m still waiting on the speaker bio and talk synopsis but will provide that once I have it. I did want to go ahead and get this in front of you so you could plan accordingly.

Here is the link to the Eventbrite registration site. Please don?t forget to register so we can plan the food and drink.
