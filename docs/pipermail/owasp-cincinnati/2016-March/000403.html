<PRE>Wow, it's hard to believe that it is already the end of March. Although we
have been quiet we have not been inactive. We have been quietly discussing
the year and how to move forward and now we have our first meeting of the
year scheduled. I will get the Eventbrite set up soon and send out the link
but I wanted to go ahead and give you the details so you can make plans.

You will notice that we have changed venues for now. Due to Citi moving out
of the Blue Ash office we had to find other meeting locations. We do not
have a permanent home yet but are still working on it.

What: Cincinnati OWASP Meeting
When: Tuesday April, 12, 2016 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM
Where: Christ Hospital Auditorium
            2139 Auburn Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45219
Who: Allison Shubert and Andy Willingham
Topic: OWASP 101 - It's been a while since we've taken a good look at what
          OWASP can do for you so we are going to highlight some of the
reasons
          that you should be involved and how OWASP can help you be a better
          security practitioner and/or software developer. Also we will
discuss how
          the OWASP Top 10 impacts your day to day life.

Since this is a new location it may take you a few minutes to find the
auditorium. My contact there tells me that it is best to park in the
Visitors Lot and enter the atrium on level A and follow the signs. I will
be visiting the site next week to get a good feel for the location and will
provide additional details if necessary.

We are planning on having Pizza so come hungry!

Regards,



Andy Willingham
