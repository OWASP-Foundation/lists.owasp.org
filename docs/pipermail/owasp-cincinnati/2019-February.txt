Message-ID: <CANJtdZu0AVDX9TAcN0vSrs4cHs=8DotxhKic0GnanVasidBpHw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP Cincinnati!  The spring thaw is nearly here and in efforts to
expedite the thaw let's discuss the very hot topic of AppSec in DevOps.  Join
us for an insightful presentation on how security requirements can still be
met in this brave new DevOps world in a discussion led by Ed Arnold,
Security Solution Architect with Qualys.


*Agenda:*

?         Speaker and topic introduction and OWASP relevancy discussion

?         Presentation - "Application Security in a DevOps World" by Ed
Arnold

?         Roundtable Discussion Opportunity

?         Housekeeping and Meeting Closure



*Presentation Abstract:*

Jenkins, Travis CI, Bamboo, Docker, AWS, API, Agile, CI/CD are the new
mainstream vocabulary of Developers who want more control over their
processes, and businesses that increasingly prioritize time-to-market.
After working for years to get into developers' workflows, how can security
practitioners keep pace with these "new" terms and the technology behind
them? This presentation will discuss the challenges that may cause some
security teams to give up in this new paradigm, and solutions to help
ensure they remain in the game.
