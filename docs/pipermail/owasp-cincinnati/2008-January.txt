Message-ID: <478434d5.21d2260a.2f67.ffff9864@mx.google.com>

OWASP local Cincinnati chapter members

 

As announced last year, I confirm that the first local chapter meeting is
scheduled for January 29th at Citigroup in Blue Ash, 11.30-1.00 PM.

Please visit our OWASP web page  <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati>
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati for further information about the
meeting.

 

The goal of the first meeting is to introduce you to OWASP and to give an
opportunity for local members to socialize.

The presentation material is herein included for your reference.

 

I encourage you to inform friends and colleagues about this meeting.

Invite them to participate to OWASP and to enroll to our mailing list.

Everybody that has keen interest on learning about application security is
welcome.

 

Above all, I am looking forward to your participation to the meeting. 

Eventually, if each of you can send me a note at (marco.m.morana at gmail.com )
with you intent to participate or not 

at the meeting that will be very helpful!

 

Thanks and Happy New Year 2008

 

Marco Morana

Indeed, sorry about that, OWASP has certainly a good email filter ;-)

Let's try with this one, please change the extension of the file from _zip

Marco,

 

I work for Rich Knowles and he passed some info along to me for review.

 

In the process of reviewing things I decided to install WebGoat.  I have
this strange feeling that it does not currently install or run on Linux.

Do you know if that is the case?

 

Everything on the OWASP site seems to only have .bat files in it and not
shell files.

 

Any thoughts?

 

Thanks

I am glad you found the meeting interesting and that raised your interest in
OWASP. This was exactly what I was looking for.

Indeed growing our local security community is OWASP major intent at this
time and I appreciate your trying to help.

I could probably move the meeting to the last Wednesday of the month if does
not conflict with other members calendar.

 

Any objections from the mailing list?

 

Regards

 

Marco

Hi Marco,

 

I thought the first local OWASP meeting was top-notch.  Thank you for
organizing and doing a great job with it.  You and Blaine really know your
stuff.

 

I have 10 years of development experience, and much of the content made
sense in the development context.  For me, the most valuable feature is
having all the information aggregated in one place.  My role isn?t
development at this point.  I work to build the IT community in Cincinnati,
and I?ll be working behind the scenes to drive traffic to OWASP.  Much of my
current role is to help local groups succeed.

 

I was reviewing the calendar and wanted to make a comment.  The last week of
the month is a GREAT week to hold OWASP as most other groups happen the
first three weeks of the month.  Yet, more often than not, the last Tuesday
of the month also coincides with the SQL Server Users Group.  I don?t know
if that will cause any issues for anyone other than me, but I wanted to let
you know.  Any other day that week seems to be available without group
overlap.

 

Again, just a comment.  Please don?t feel the need to modify the schedule
for me.

 

Andy

I have also installed it on Mac OS X (10.4). Just throw tomcat on there 
and drop the webgoat war file in the appropriate directory and off you go. 
Be sure to check the tomcat docu for the default port number it listens 
on.

Subject: OWASP Question

 

Marco,

 

I work for Rich Knowles and he passed some info along to me for review.

 

In the process of reviewing things I decided to install WebGoat.  I have 
this strange feeling that it does not currently install or run on Linux.

Do you know if that is the case?

 

Everything on the OWASP site seems to only have .bat files in it and not 
shell files.

 

Any thoughts?

 

Thanks

Steve
