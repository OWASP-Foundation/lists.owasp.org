The Epsilon Hack Attack: Time For &quot;SOX For Consumers&quot;?Forbes (blog)

Although this is just one of many such data breaches over the years, because
it is so massive and so extensive, it raises issues of security and privacy
that should be near and dear to every consumer's heart. And, for those of us
in the business of ...

About 50 companies were affected by a major security breach at e-mail
service provider Epsilon Interactive that caused many U.S. corporations to
warn their customers of online attacks Monday.

Epsilon first warned of the incident Friday, saying that someone had got
into company systems and obtained e-mail addresses and names belonging to
some of its customers. But it wasn't immediately clear how many of its 2,500
clients were at risk. Epsilon is still being tight-lipped about the problem,
but it has now given a clearer picture of how many companies are affected.

In a brief statement posted to Epsilon's website Monday, the company said
that &quot;approximately 2 percent of total clients&quot; -- about 50 businesses --
were hit.

 

Customers of many of these businesses, which include Target, Citigroup, Tivo
and Walgreens, woke up Monday to e-mail warnings, telling them that their
e-mail addresses had been stolen, and that spam or malicious messages could
be coming their way. But so far, Epsilon has refused to provide a detailed
list of all companies that were affected.

It is very nice to know that a piece of software you are thinking of buying

As that suggests, when it comes to vulnerabilities, attackers have largely
shifted their focus from operating systems and browsers to browser
plug-ins--and especially Flash. But businesses are having a difficult time
coping with the non-stop &quot;patch or ...

Business banking fraud -- particularly in small and midsize companies -- is
still causing major problems for both the businesses and the banks that
serve them, according to a study published today.

 

The &quot;2011 Business Banking Trust Study,&quot; a follow-up to a similar study
conducted last year, was written by Ponemon Institute and sponsored by
Guardian Analytics. This year's numbers suggest that the banking fraud
situation has not improved since 2010.

 

&quot;The industry has not moved the needle in addressing the corporate account
takeover and fraud plaguing SMBs and their financial institutions,&quot; the
report states. &quot;The data shows that fraud is still pervasive, money is
leaving accounts unnoticed at an alarming rate, and businesses will leave
their banks because of it.&quot;

 

Fifty-six percent of businesses experienced fraud in the past 12 months,
according to the study. Of those that experienced fraud, 61 percent were
victimized more than once. Seventy-five percent of the victims experienced
online account takeover and/or online fraud. These figures are nearly the
same as last year's, the researchers say.
