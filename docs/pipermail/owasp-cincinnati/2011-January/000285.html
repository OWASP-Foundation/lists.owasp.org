<PRE>Marco,

    Thanks for the email and Happy New Year.   There are 2 things on my list of to dos this year that I am interested in and that is the implementation of a vulnerability management system and the other is data loss prevention.   I am interested in topics related to these 2 issues as well as discussions on Security Information and Event Management systems.   I guess what I would like to see as a presentation are best practices for each of these areas and implementation gotchya's and pitfalls.   Other topics of interest would be configuration management and user awareness.

    As of right now the 25th looks ok for me.

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Meeting Dates and Topics for January Meeting: February 25th

List

First of all happy new year 2011. I am putting together a list of speakers for 2011. Unfortunately I do not have anybody to give a talk, available for January.

I am willing to cover the January meeting with one of my talks on business flaw analysis with application threat modeling or set up a video meeting/forum discussions featuring one of the OWASP Appsec conference talks. Refer to <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video</A>

Also as date for the meeting I am thinking we can gather the last Tuesday of January that will be the 25th.

If you can please let me know:

1)      Which topic you are more interested to cover at OWASP chapter for 2011

2)      If you are you interested on my talk on finding security business flaws using threat modeling

3)      If Tuesday 25th  12.00 PM work best for your availability to attend

If you please let me know by EOW so I will plan and prepare accordingly

Thank you

Marco Morana
