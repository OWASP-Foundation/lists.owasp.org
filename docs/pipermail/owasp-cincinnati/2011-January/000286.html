&gt;<i> Marco,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the email and Happy New Year. There are 2 things on my list of
</I>to dos this year that I am interested in and that is the implementation of a
vulnerability management system and the other is data loss prevention. I am
interested in topics related to these 2 issues as well as discussions on
Security Information and Event Management systems. I guess what I would like
to see as a presentation are best practices for each of these areas and
implementation gotchya's and pitfalls. Other topics of interest would be
configuration management and user awareness.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As of right now the 25th looks ok for me.

</I>&gt;<i> List
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all happy new year 2011. I am putting together a list of speakers
</I>for 2011. Unfortunately I do not have anybody to give a talk, available for
January.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am willing to cover the January meeting with one of my talks on business
</I>flaw analysis with application threat modeling or set up a video
meeting/forum discussions featuring one of the OWASP Appsec conference
talks. Refer to <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video</A>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also as date for the meeting I am thinking we can gather the last Tuesday
</I>of January that will be the 25th.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can please let me know:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Which topic you are more interested to cover at OWASP chapter for 2011
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) If you are you interested on my talk on finding security business flaws
</I>using threat modeling
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) If Tuesday 25th 12.00 PM work best for your availability to attend
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you please let me know by EOW so I will plan and prepare accordingly
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you
