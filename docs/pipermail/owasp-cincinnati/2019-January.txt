Agenda:

?         Speaker Introduction, Topic Overview, and OWASP Relevancy

?         Presentation -  "Where Does It Hurt? - The Anatomy of a Data
Breach" by Zach Briggs

?         Roundtable Discussion Opportunity

?         Housekeeping and Meeting Closure



*Discussion Abstract:*

*Summary:*

Awareness is not understanding. In the age of Google and WebMD, people are
aware of a lot, but they don?t understand nearly as much. Case in point -
all that causes sickness is not cancer, not all who lose data have had a
breach.



My goal in this presentation is to challenge your understanding of what
makes up a data breach by explaining its full anatomy so that you can
diagnose where it hurts and how to fix it or if you are even sick at all.
All while sharing some of life?s best medicine (laughter) along the way.
