Sticks and stones: Picking on users AND security pros 

Johnston, a member of the Vulnerability Assessment Team at Argonne National
Laboratory. In the presentation, he gave examples of surprising (or not)
examples of what he has seen as a vulnerability assessor: 

security devices, systems and programs with little or no security -- or
security thought -- built in. There are the well-designed security products
foolishly configured by those who buy them, thus causing more vulnerability
than before the devices were installed.
