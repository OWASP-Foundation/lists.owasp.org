<PRE>list

please mark you calendar for the next chapter meeting: March 24th Accuvant Presentation 
I will soon send you the topic and the agenda as soon as I got them from Accuvant

Please RSVP to me by email at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-cincinnati">marco.m.morana at gmail.com</A> with RSVP to March 24th Meeting on the subject of the email

I am also pleased to announce that on April 28th we have a confirmed talk from Rohyt Belani from Intrepidous Group:
Bad Cocktail: Application Security Flaws + Targeted Phishing  Site takedown services, anti-phishing filters, and millions of dollars worth of protective technologies...and the spear phishers are still successful! This presentation will discuss why this is the case. Today, phishing is a key component in a &quot;hackers&quot; repertoire. Phishers are combining social engineering with application security flaws in well known websites to make automated detection of targeted phishing attacks almost impossible. The result - hijacked online brokerage accounts, stolen identities and e-bank robberies. During this talk, I will present the techniques used by attackers to execute such spear phishing attacks, and real-world cases that I have responded to that will provide perspective on the impact. I will then discuss countermeasures that have been proven to be effective and are recommended by reputed bodies like SANS and Carnegie Mellon University.  
Rohyt Belani is CEO and co-founder of the Intrepidus Group, and Adjunct Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to starting the Intrepidus Group, Mr. Belani has held the positions of Managing Director at Mandiant, Principal Consultant at Foundstone and Researcher at the US-CERT. He is a contributing author for Osborne's Hack Notes - Network Security, as well as Addison Wesley's Extrusion Detection: Security Monitoring for Internal Intrusions. Mr. Belani is a regular speaker at various industry conferences including Black Hat, OWASP, ASIS, SecTOR, Hack in the Box, Infosec World, TechnoSecurity, CPM, ISSA meetings, and several forums catering to the FBI, US Secret Service, and US Military. He has written technical articles and columns for online publications like Securityfocus and SC magazine, and has been interviewed by BBC Radio, Forbes magazine, eWeek, ComputerWorld, TechNewsWorld, InformationWeek, Information Today, IndustryWeek, E-Commerce Times, SmartMoney, and Hacker Japan. Mr. Belani holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Bombay University and a Master of Science in Information Networking from Carnegie Mellon University. He currently leads the OWASP Java Project a world-wide consortium of Java security experts. 

Hope you find this interesting, looking forward to your participation

Thanks
