Hey y'all, here is the info for the August meeting. We had a last minute
cancellation from our scheduled speaker. Luckily Blaine Wilson stepped up
and agreed to do one of his demo/talks. He is going to show us how to use
WebScarab as an easy to ensure that your apps are secure.

We will meet on Tuesday the 14th from 12:00 - 1:30 at our usual place. See
you then. Go to https://cincy_owasp_2012.eventbrite.com to register so we
know who will be there.
