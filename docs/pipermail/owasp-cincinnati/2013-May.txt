Happy Summer!

WOW! What a long, long winter. And here it is May 24th and it's 55 degrees
outside. Something just doesn't seem right to me about that. I hope that
all of you are well and that you are ready to jump back into the swing of
things with OWASP. We obviously have been very quiet the first half of the
year but now we are ready to get things going again.

Our first meeting of 2013 will be on Tuesday June 18th, 2013. We will meet
at our regular location.

Citi
9997 Carver Rd
Blue Ash, Oh 45242

We will meet at our regular time from 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM. We will have
food.
The topic of the meeting will be a discussion of the 2013 Verizon Data
Breach Incident Report (VDBIR). Allison, Andy, and Blaine will be
discussing the report and how we see it playing out in the lives of those
of us who are tasked with protecting our companies systems and applications.

I will be setting up a Eventbrite Invite soon so you can register but I
wanted to go ahead and get the word out so that you can put it on your
calendar. I hope to see you in June as well as the rest of the monthly
meetings.

Thanks,
