Fellow OWASP Ohio Chapters Attendees

 

The April 22 movie event is ready to roll out and I encourage you to sign-on
your RSVP on the site if you have not done yet.

The registration can be reached via the URL

http://www.fortify.com/cybercrime/OWASPCincinnati/registration.html

 

The details of the event are found on our chapter web page

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati

 

We also have the current event on schedule:

May 20th Marco Morana and John Fellers will present on Cross Site Request
Forgery: The Threat, The Vulnerability and The Countermeasure

 

I got interest from Dr Walden on presentation on injection attacks (mostly
SQL, but including other types like XML).

This could be scheduled for this summer or fall.

 

I encourage you to submit topics for presentation so we can plan a calendar
for 2008

 

Thanks

Fellow OWASP Cincinnati Mailing List 

 

Thanks for the current 22 subscribers of the April 22nd event. Just a remind
Cincinnati OWASP chapter welcomes the sponsor selection of Cincinnati for
the preview of The New Face of Cybercrime movie. The sponsor will fly an
executive at their expense here in Cincy and paying for the catering.
Citigroup will sponsor the logistics in terms of facility. This is all free
for you. Now to raise the interest in the participation I will provide OWASP
books for free to the first 10 people that subscribe the event (please CC to
me)

 

Also, please share information about the movie with your colleagues and
friends. I also welcome any ideas on how we can publish the event.  Please
do not miss this opportunity to have your say on the topic of cyber security
and to show that Cincinnati OWASP security community is worth consideration.

 

Thanks

OWASP Chapter attendees

 

Thanks for responding to the call of registering to the OWASP event, the
movie premiere of The New Face of Cybercrime. We currently have more then 45
people registered to the event. There is still time for RSVP by visiting the
site https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#April_Meeting

 

I would also announce that the speaker introducing the movie will be Maj.
Bruce C. Jenkins. Major Bruce C. Jenkins, (USAF, Ret.) is a Security
Practice Director at Fortify Software, Inc., where his responsibilities
include refining customer security requirements, managing Fortify product
deployments and the delivery of security services.

 

Prior to joining Fortify, he spent 26 of his 28 years in the service leading
people, managing projects, and dealing with technological and organizational
change.  His military experiences range from managing a small team of
aircraft avionics technicians to commanding a communications unit supporting
over 3,000 U.S. and international forces in Southwest Asia.  During his last
military assignment as Chief of Systems Security, 554th Electronic Systems
Wing, he helped build the foundation for what is now the U.S. Air Force
Application Software Assurance Center of Excellence.

 

Bruce holds a BS in computer science from the University of Maryland and MS
in operations research from the Air Force Institute of Technology.  He is a
Certified Ethical Hacker with countless hours of Internet surf time, where
he has learned that paranoia is a perfectly legitimate state of mind

 

Also I would like to special thanks Andy Erickson of lucrum
(www.lucruminc.com <http://www.lucruminc.com/> ) for publicizing the event
and hosting a podcast on the event

OWASP Cincinnati members

 

Thanks for participating to the April 22nd event. Wayne Browning and Allison
Shubert especially as organizers first of all thanks for your support and
time spent on organizing the event. As chapter lead I am very happy on how
things turned out in terms of local participation. A counted about 40 people
attending the event that is the most people attending we never had. We also
showed how enthusiastic our OWASP chapter in Cincinnati is on the topic of
application security.

 

One little mishap I had was on my behalf for the OWASP books that were not
shipped on time to be delivered at the event.

I pledged to give away 10 Lulu OWASP books and I'll maintain the promise.

Please respond to my email if you would like to receive the books and I will
deliver them to you to the next meeting. 

 

The next meeting we plan a dive on CSRF Cross Site Request Forgery
Vulnerability. I received a proposal for a session on CAPTCHA, Software
Security Enhanced Lifecycles and SQL Injection. I encourage anybody to
submit a topic for presentation if interested.

 

Also, please feel free to use this mailing list to continue the topic of
discussion we had started after the movie.

 

With best regards

It will be nice if we can coordinate a presentation on SQL injection with Dr
Walden since he expressed desire to cover this topic during the summer. 

On the calendar I have CSRF for May, Marco Morana & John Fellers.
The tentative calendar is
2) June Software Security Enhanced Process Models: Marco Morana
3) July: CAPTCHA Marco Morana + TBD or SQL Injection/Walden-Combs
4) August: SQL Injection/Walden-Combs or ESAPI/TBD
5) September: ESAPI/TBD or ??
6) October: Application Security Testing/Marco + TBD
7) November:TBD
9) December: not sure we need a presentation maybe just get together event..

Also I encourage taking the trail of discussion we started at the last
meeting and use the mailing list to exchange ideas/experiences/perspectives.

I think we discussed:
1) Is the public perception of a company security breach a factor in making
a company more secure (TJ Maxx example)

2) How much software security comes from strategy or technology, when
security will be become a feature built into the product not an added on as
a 'sexy" feature

3) How much compliance and liability are factors in driving software
security (liability contracts for security bugs, PCI compliance)

What I also would like to encourage is to reach out software development
companies/consulting in the tri-state area since I do not think OWASP is
well represented in that area. We also lack any P&G and GE representation.
Probably this is something that Andy Erickson can help me out with (local
PR). Any ideas?

Regards

Marco

Are you looking for presenters for the topics below? I have done a 
couple presentations on SQL injection and would be happy to cover this. 
Another presentation I thought about proposing (only because I don't 
know much about it but want to force myself to learn more) is the OWASP 
ESAPI.
