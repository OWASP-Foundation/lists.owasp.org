Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] November Cincinnati OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <CAJM-gMMazMCqwfiqWaKqGn7VyUhGG=FJgtmGER=JimKqGqL76A@mail.gmail.com>

I hope this message finds all of you doing well and enjoying the last
remnants of warm weather. What better way to kick off the beginnings of
colder weather than spending time with friends and colleagues in a warm
room learning about information security. OK, so there may be a few better
ways but this isn't too bad.

We have scheduled a meeting for Tuesday Nov 18th. We will meet at the Blue
Ash Citi Offices as usual and we will meet at the same time 12:00 PM - 1:30
PM. Details on the speaker and topic are below. This month we will be
talking about PCI a topic that is near and dear to the hearts of many of us
and the numbers continue to grow. Both of those who need to know about PCI
and those who are impacted by it and the failure of companies to maintain
compliance and for the PCI council to provide meaningful guidance.

I hope to see you there. Please remember to register at our Eventbrite
site.
