All,

Thanks to everyone that made it to the meeting yesterday. We had a great
turn out and an engaging talk about PCI. I hope that each of you found it
useful.

Over the last year or so I've noticed that we have lots of "dead weight" in
our email list. What I mean is that there are lots of invalid emails due to
email accounts being disabled or job changes. As a result many people do
not get notified of upcoming events. So over the next couple of days I'm
going to "spam" you. Our email system has a process where it will
automatically clean up inactive emails based on bounce responses. We
typically keep the threshold fairly high so this doesn't happen by
accident. I have lowered the threshold temporarily and will be sending out
several messages so that we do meet the threshold and can clean up the list.

If you are currently subscribed to the list using your work email you may
want to consider changing to a personal email so that you continue to
receive email in case you change jobs. Plus it's always nice to keep your
work inbox clean and focused on work. :)

I hope this doesn't cause any problems for any of you and I also hope that
you will forgive me for the temporary spamming of your account.

Thanks,

Andy Willingham
