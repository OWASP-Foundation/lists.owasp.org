Hey Gang

I apologize for letting September sneak up on us. We had speaker issues and a mix up on my part with a joint ISSA and OWASP meeting. I thought it was this week so I didn't rush to get a speaker to fill in. Turns out the meeting is next month. I guess I need to check my calendar a bit more closely.  

Anyway on October 18th Jeff Williams will be in town to speak to the ISSA chapter. Jeff is one of the early OWASP leaders and is very influential in the world of AppSec. I'll have more details soon.

We may also have a regular meeting in October if things work out. 

Hope y'all have a great week and I'll send more info soon.
