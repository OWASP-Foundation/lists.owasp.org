Hey Y'all, sorry for the late notice but between vacation, the holiday, and
trying o get some actual work done I'm running behind this month. Any way,
the meeting is Tuesday the 10th at noon. All of the details and
registration info is at  http:\\www.eventbrite.com\event\3850611282. At the
moment we do not have a sponsor so I'm not sure If we will have pizza or
not.

Thanks,
