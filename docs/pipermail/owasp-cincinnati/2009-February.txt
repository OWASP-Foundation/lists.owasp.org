Re: [Owasp-cincinnati] OWASP-Cincy Video-Forum Topic Survey For February MeetingFolks

here are the polls for the Forum topics so far:
  1.. Threat Modeling 
  2.. Secure Architecture 
  3.. Secure Software Development 
  4.. Botnets Attacks 
  5.. Web-based malware 1
  6.. O-Day Browser exploits 
  7.. Java Security 1
  8.. Security Testing : 1
  9.. Attacks to financial applications 2
  10.. Web Services Security 1
  11.. Static Analysis Tools: 2
  12.. Things you know for APPSEC/INFOSEC Employment 1
got response only from four people!. I added Joe Combs suggestion on 12.

Again the idea is to organize these Forums every other month to display AppSec videos (OWASP. Hack in the box etc)
and have an interesting discussion and share of knowledge/perspective on application security topics

Also I am putting down the calendar for the speakers. If you are interested to present please let me know the TOPIC and DATE.

So far I had Dr Walden (July) and I am talking with Verdasys (TBD) and Accuvant (March) to have someone of their consultants/reps to give a talk. 
I plan to give a couple of talks on threat analysis with attack trees (April) and secure design patterns (June)

thanks

Actually, to clarify, item 12 was a huge NO vote on that video and a 
word of caution to not waste your time on that video.  I found it hugely 
disappointing, really just a glorified resume writing and interviewing 
seminar, not the professional development tips the name would imply.

Re: [Owasp-cincinnati] OWASP-Cincy Video-Forum Topic Survey For February MeetingOk, let's take #12 off, I think you mentioned thumbs down in your previous email and I missed...my apologizes.
So Joe what is your vote in the 1-11 list? You can vote up to six in order of preference.

Honestly this is BH Jeff Moss hype...

The weakness is not SSL in my opinion but the fact that attacking the user is always the weakest ring of the chain.
Now how many user are aware of using HTTPS instead of HTTP or even pay attention to a valid SSL certificate? Probably many. Is SSL the problem? No.
Can we do better? yes, How? Deploy MFA, SSL EV, Mutual Certificate etc. So what is new on this that we did not know already apart a new tool to prove the point?

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/19/ssl_busting_demo/

By Dan Goodin in San Francisco
The Register
19th February 2009

Website encryption has sustained another body blow, this time by an 
independent hacker who demonstrated a tool that can steal sensitive 
information by tricking users into believing they're visiting protected 
sites when in fact they're not.

Unveiled Wednesday at the Black Hat security conference in Washington, 
SSLstrip works on public Wi-Fi networks, onion-routing systems, and 
anywhere else a man-in-the-middle attack is practical. It converts pages 
that normally would be protected by the secure sockets layer protocol 
into their unencrypted versions. It does this while continuing to fool 
both the website and the user into believing the security measure is 
still in place.

The presentation by a conference attendee who goes by the name Moxie 
Marlinspike is the latest demonstration of weaknesses in SSL, the 
encryption routine websites use to prevent passwords, credit card 
numbers, and other sensitive information from being sniffed while in 
transit. Similar to side jacking attack from 2007 and last year's 
forging of a certificate authority certificate, it shows the measure 
goes only so far.

"The attack is, as far as I know, quite novel and cool," said fellow 
researcher Dan Kaminsky, who attended the Black Hat presentation. "The 
larger message of Moxie's talk is one that a lot of people have been 
talking about actually for a few years now: This SSL thing is not 
working very well."

Agreed.  SSLstrip is nothing new.  The problem with SSL isn't the
protocol, but the user ignoring its warnings.  I don't think there's
going to be a general solution to that, though there is enormous room
for improvement in security user interfaces.  One user study found
that users were more likely to respond to a phishing attack if they
received a browser warning about the certificate--they didn't read the
error at all, but just skimmed something with the word security and
felt reassured.

Firefox 3's interface for handling bad certificates is much better
than other browsers, so we might see some improvements with time.
There are also tools like Passpet (http://passpet.org/) that greatly
reduce the chance of user error by changing how passwords are handled
in the browser.  You can find a variety of innovative security
interface ideas at the SOUPS conference
(http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/).

Indeed I did some research on my own on the effectiveness of current browser 
warnings and the results are discouraging, even with the new deployment of 
EV SSL certificates
I think the direction you are referring to, better user interaction and 
better UIs is what the industry need to work on.
This is also advocated by Amir Herberg that this very nice research on this 
field. See reference to his OWASP presentation as well as some of the 
studies on users ignoring warnings (*).

An evaluation of EV and Picture in Picture Attacks: ..EV did not help users 
to identify either (picture in pic and homograph attacks.

Usability studies show that server-identification, e.g. by an image or text 
displayed in the login page, can provide a modest improvement in the 
detection rates of spoofed sites. We found an improvement in detection 
rates, when the user was actively involved in the image selection and 
display (e.g. if user must click on the image).

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Meeting Follow Up:SQL Injection Attacks And
	FilterEvasion Techniques
Message-ID: <954C748B6293447494A3F86539483E8E@GCGNA.DYN.NSROOT.NET>

In one of the use cases that was shown during the last meeting, the attacker will split the SQL injection attack vector to by-pass IDS filter signatures.

Bypass techniques can be changing an attack vectors to evade the signature checked by the IDS.
For example in the case of  SQL attack vector, http://[site]/page.jsp?id=2or1=1-- changing = to "like" in the signature
it will becomes http://[site]/page.jsp?id=2or1like1-- or by inserting comments http://[site]/page.jsp?id=2/**/or/**/1/**/like/**/1/**--

Other techniques include encoding (like for XSS), using char(), using white spaces
Some of the techniques for by pass filters (including IDS signatures) as well as the linked server attacks being presented are covered by Victor Chapela OWASP paper herein:
http://www.owasp.org/images/7/74/Advanced_SQL_Injection.ppt

In general IDS evation techniques are documented herein
http://insecure.org/stf/secnet_ids/secnet_ids.html

a tool such as nmap can also do a test of your IDS actually can be bypassed

Cincy OWASP Attendees

we had a good follow up of the discussion at the last meeting and thanks for your participation
I have included herein the forum presentation. 

I have contacted the authors of the presentation to check if I can have the original presentation uploaded on the site.
To help the video quality, probably the next Forum format I will try to use the original presentation and synchronize with a stream audio.

I will follow up with Jamie questions about IDS filer evasion technique used in one of the attacks and Gudla on open source tools.

Cheers

ACCEPTANCE TESTING TOOLS - OPEN SOURCE

 Acceptance testing tools are used to validate the functionality of web applications. Some follow a scripted approach and

typically make use of a Unit Testing framework to construct test suites and test cases. Most, if not all, can be adapted to

perform security specific tests in addition to functional tests.

. WATIR - http://wtr.rubyforge.org

o A Ruby-based web testing framework that provides an interface into Internet Explorer.

o Windows only.

. HtmlUnit - http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net

o A Java and JUnit based framework that uses the Apache HttpClient as the transport.

o Very robust and configurable and is used as the engine for a number of other testing tools.

. jWebUnit - http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net

o A Java based meta-framework that uses htmlunit or selenium as the testing engine.

. Canoo Webtest - http://webtest.canoo.com

o An XML based testing tool that provides a facade on top of htmlunit.

o No coding is necessary as the tests are completely specified in XML.

o There is the option of scripting some elements in Groovy if XML does not suffice.

o Very actively maintained.

. HttpUnit - http://httpunit.sourceforge.net

o One of the first web testing frameworks, suffers from using the native JDK provided HTTP transport, which can be a

bit limiting for security testing.

. Watij - http://watij.com

o A Java implementation of WATIR.

o Windows only because it uses IE for its tests (Mozilla integration is in the works).

. Solex - http://solex.sourceforge.net

o An Eclipse plugin that provides a graphical tool to record HTTP sessions and make assertions based on the results.

. Selenium - http://www.openqa.org/selenium/

o JavaScript based testing framework, cross-platform and provides a GUI for creating tests.

o Mature and popular tool, but the use of JavaScript could hamper certain security tests.
