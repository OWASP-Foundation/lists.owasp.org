I am accepting RSVP for the next OWASP meeting on Tuesday April 27.  

 

You can register by selecting the date April 27 from

Here are the details for the presentation, 

Abstract: Measuring Your Proactive Security Efforts

Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high intensity weight
training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate goal is often
clear, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently make is to
overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting progress. Like a
successful bodybuilding workout, a security development lifecycle program
must consistently log simple to obtain, yet meaningful metrics throughout
the entire process. Good metrics must lack subjectivity and clearly aid
decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In this pragmatic
presentation we'll discuss metrics used at Symantec, the world's largest
security ISV, to classify and appropriately compare security vulnerabilities
found in different phases of the SDL by different teams working in different
locations and in different products. We'll also discuss how to easily
provide decision makers different views of the same data and verify whether
the process is indeed catching critical vulnerabilities internally and how
the numbers compare with the competition 

Speaker Bio: Cassio Goldschmidt 

Cassio Goldschmidt is senior manager of the product security team under the
Office of the CTO at Symantec Corporation. In this role he leads efforts
across the company to ensure the secure development of software products.
His responsibilities include managing Symantec's internal secure software
development process, training, threat modeling, penetration testing and
vulnerability management. Cassio's background includes over 14 years of
technical and managerial experience in the software industry. During the
eight years he has been with Symantec, he has helped to architect, design
and develop several top selling product releases, conducted numerous
security classes, and coordinated various penetration tests. Cassio is also
known for leading the OWASP chapter in Los Angeles and is a frequent speaker
at security conferences worldwide. Cassio represents Symantec on the
SAFECode technical committee and (ISC)2 in the development of the CSSLP
certification. He holds a bachelor degree in computer science from
Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande Do Sul, a masters degree in
software engineering from Santa Clara University, and a masters of business
administration from the University of Southern California

Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure Your Business
Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors & Data 

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries,
it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and
security of the software running its business critical applications. As a
result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent
attack vector used by hackers. Whether you manage internal development
activities, work with third party developers or are developing a COTS
application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and
make applications security a priority for internal and external development
teams. In this session we will cover; (1) Prevalence of backdoors and
malicious code in third party attacks; (2) Definitions and classifications
of backdoors and their impact on your applications; (3) Methods to identify,
track and remediate these vulnerabilities 

Speaker Bio:Clint Pollock 

Clint Pollock is a Senior Solutions Architect at Veracode. Since 1997, he
has also created security solutions for large-scale enterprise environments
on behalf of CREDANT Technologies and Netegrity. In his current role, Clint
helps globally distributed organizations evaluate, track, and mitigate their
application security risk. Clint's greatest strengths are his enthusiasm,
experience and determination to help customers succeed in maintaining
secure, compliant systems, and avoid the consequences and bad headlines that
come with application security breaches. Clint resides in Chicago, IL.
