My short answer to your question is that the goal here is to implement
segregation of duties between production and development to limit the
potential security risks (e.g. fraud disruptions) of a developer accessing
production environment that includes systems and data.

The level at which the enforcement of this control is feasible for any given
organization, large or small, depends on several factors. 

Ideally you have full separation of environments and developers never had
access to production systems and data, a configuration control/management
process will validate/approve which code and data move from development to
test and from test to production. A configuration manager will approve the
changes and the release of the code from dev to the test environment (e.g.
UAT) and from test to production.

Occasionally you could give developer access to production but it would
imply that you have detective controls in place such as audit trail and
granted temporary privileges and revoke access after the change in
production is being promoted. This is a more risk proposition but is seldom
adopted by small companies with limited resources. Additionally you after
the change is made you could validate that any change could be detected such
as using fingerprinting software as Tripwire.

But allowing temporary access of developers to production, besides the
potential risks of fraud and disruption, it could also represent a
compliance risk (e.g. SOX 404 audit) therefore it is important to keep in
mind the implications of not passing an audit. An auditor might be ok for a
developer having temporary access to production assuming the change is
audited, supervised and approved by a change control manager or might see
this strictly as gap in the implementation of segregation of duties. I
cannot answer this since I do not have experience on SOX audits. If there is
no audit requirement to satisfy I would think that reducing the risk of
developers access to production with compensating and detective controls
should be a viable options and leave an acceptable residual risk for the
organization.

Hope this helps

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] practical implementation of development and
production environment separation

Being a network/data communications type of guy, I am trying to beef up my
understanding of the application development world and its security
aspects that are integrated in the SDLC.  I know that we all discuss
having separation between the test/development and production environments
and placing developers in the test world with no access to the production
world.  I am curious to find out what companies do to implement such a
solution.

I can imagine that developers work a good portion of their time on the
application itself but they too have daily needs that are fulfilled in the
production environment such as browsing the web, email, instant messaging,
intranet access and file and printing.  How is this typically handled so
that both of these functions can be performed effectively by the developer
staff?  How do you physically or logically break up these domains so as to
not make it cumbersome to the development staff.  Does this separation
concept only apply to the applications themselves (ie. Developers cannot
reach the production application) or does it extend to other functions in
the production network?
