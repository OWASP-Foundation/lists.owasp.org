<PRE>Being a network/data communications type of guy, I am trying to beef up my
understanding of the application development world and its security
aspects that are integrated in the SDLC.  I know that we all discuss
having separation between the test/development and production environments
and placing developers in the test world with no access to the production
world.  I am curious to find out what companies do to implement such a
solution.

I can imagine that developers work a good portion of their time on the
application itself but they too have daily needs that are fulfilled in the
production environment such as browsing the web, email, instant messaging,
intranet access and file and printing.  How is this typically handled so
that both of these functions can be performed effectively by the developer
staff?  How do you physically or logically break up these domains so as to
not make it cumbersome to the development staff.  Does this separation
concept only apply to the applications themselves (ie. Developers cannot
reach the production application) or does it extend to other functions in
the production network?
