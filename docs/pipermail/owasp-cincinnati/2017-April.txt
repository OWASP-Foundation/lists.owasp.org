Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] April Meeting
Message-ID: <5ba47ea0-e91a-4a9f-961e-e137c64b6fbe@Spark>

Happy Easter!

?I hope this finds all of you doing well. For those of you who made it to our March meeting last month I have a bit of a surprise. Although I said that we were most likely only going to meet quarterly this year we had an opportunity come up to have a speaker this month and we didn?t want to pass this up.

Many of you will remember our speaker from his talk a couple of years ago. He was here in 2012 and talked to us about application security testing. Now he will be in town later this month and was kind enough to come speak to us about best practices in Managing an Application Security Program.

The meeting will be on April 27, 2017 from 12:00 - 1:30 PM. Paycor has offered to host us again and Security Compass will be sponsoring lunch. More information and registration can be found on our Eventbrite page at?https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-cincinnati-april-2017-tickets-33729747583

We hope to see many of you there!

Message-ID: <dd98e934-8f86-479c-b5da-96e1a20b3168@Spark>

I?m apparently getting creative in my old age. I?ve created a Facebook page for the chapter and wanted to share it with the group. It?s not very fancy but it?s another venue for sharing information about IS in the area and spreading the word about OWASP and our chapter. ?When you get a chance check it out and feel free to post appropriate information on the page. Additionally for those of you who don?t know we also have a LinkedIn page. The URLs for both are below.

Happy Friday! I hope all of you are doing well. It was great seeing some of you yesterday at our April meeting. I hope you enjoyed the talk and information provided by Altaz from Security Compass.

I wanted to remind you of a couple of things that are happening. First, as i mentioned last week we now have a Facebook page that I'm using to share information about the chapter and news that I find to be interesting and think you would as well. Feel free to jump in and join the conversation there.

Also on May 24th there is a new IT/IS conference coming to Cincinnati. The Interface Conference is a one day event where topics related to IT/IS will be highlighted. There will be talks, round tables, and opportunities to network. It is free to IT professionals and you can earn up to 6.5 CPE credits to apply to any certifications that you may have. You can find more information and register here, www.interfacetour.com/evites/cin/owasp.htm (http://www.interfacetour.com/evites/cin/owasp.htm)

We are making plans for our next meeting most likely in June. More information will be provided as we get the details finalized.

We are looking for your ideas on topics and speakers for upcoming meetings. If you have something that you think would be a good topic for us to address let us know. If you would like to speak or know someone who would be interested let us know. Also, if you have heard someone at another venue or conference that you would like for us to try and get here let us know.

Be safe and we will see you around town.
