<PRE>Just in time for summer, OWASP is pleased announce 2 new individual
membership options - purchase a two year membership for $95 USD (a $5
savings), or a lifetime membership for $500 USD.  In addition to all the
regular benefits of individual membership, when you purchase our new
lifetime membership you will also receive a metal membership card to thank
you for your contribution.

Some of the benefits you will receive as an individual member include a
vote in our upcoming board election and WASPY Awards, discounted conference
admission (including $50 off admission to our upcoming AppSec USA event),
and an owasp.org email address. Learn more about membership benefits here:
