<PRE>I hope this message finds all of you doing well and enjoying the last
remnants of warm weather. What better way to kick off the beginnings of
colder weather than spending time with friends and colleagues in a warm
room learning about information security. OK, so there may be a few better
ways but this isn't too bad.

We have scheduled a meeting for Tuesday Nov 18th. We will meet at the Blue
Ash Citi Offices as usual and we will meet at the same time 12:00 PM - 1:30
PM. Details on the speaker and topic are below. This month we will be
talking about PCI a topic that is near and dear to the hearts of many of us
and the numbers continue to grow. Both of those who need to know about PCI
and those who are impacted by it and the failure of companies to maintain
compliance and for the PCI council to provide meaningful guidance.

I hope to see you there. Please remember to register at our Eventbrite
site.

Topic: PCI Risk Assessment - A method to reduce breaches

Speaker: Dharshan Shanthamurthy of SISA Information Security

Session Abstract: The recent breaches at PCI compliant organizations have
raised questions on additional security measures that organizations can
take to improve their security posture. Breaches are becoming part of
boardroom discussions and it&#8217;s obvious that information security managers
are in the spotlight to come out with answers on what they are doing to
improve their security posture. This session aims to provide meaningful
guidance on how PCI DSS Risk Assessment should be conducted, so that
organizations can safeguard proactively themselves rather than waiting for
a breach to happen.

&#8226; What is a formal risk assessment

&#8226; How to plan a formal risk assessment for PCI DSS Compliance

&#8226; Common misconceptions in PCI Risk Assessment

&#8226; How can a formal PCI Risk assessment help you in securing your
organization

&#8226; Why PCI DSS Risk Assessment should be treated as a continuous business
process for your organization
