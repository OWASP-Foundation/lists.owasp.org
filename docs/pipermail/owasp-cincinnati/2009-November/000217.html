<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#Upcoming_November_Meeting">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#Upcoming_November_Meeting</A>

 

Presenter: Ryan Barnett, Director of Application Security Research, Breach
Security Inc. 

What: Virtual Patching for Web Applications: Theory and Practice 

Fixing identified vulnerabilities in web application always requires time.
Organizations often do not have access to a commercial application's source
code and are at the vendor's mercy while waiting for a patch. Even if they
have access to the code, implementing a patch in development takes time.
This leaves a window of opportunity for the attacker to exploit. External
patching (also called &quot;just-in-time patching&quot; and &quot;virtual patching&quot;) is one
of the biggest advantages of web application firewalls as they can fix this
problem externally. A fix for a specific vulnerability is usually very easy
to design and in most cases it can be done in less than 15 minutes. This
presentation will outline exactly when and where Virtual Patching is
appropriate and will show the proper steps for their creation and testing. 

Presenter Bio: Ryan C. Barnett is the Director of Application Security
Research at Breach Security where he leads Breach Security Labs. He is a
frequent speaker at industry conferences such as Blackhat and is a Faculty
Member for the SANS Institute and Team Lead for the Center for Internet
Security Apache Benchmark Project. He is the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set
(CRS) Project Leader and a member of the Web Application Security Consortium
where he leads the Distributed Open Proxy Honeypot Project. Mr. Barnett has
also authored a web security book for Addison/Wesley Publishing entitled
&quot;Preventing Web Attacks with Apache&quot;.
