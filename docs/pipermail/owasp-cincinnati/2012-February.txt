We are off to a great start this year! We had a great crowd in attendance
for our January meeting to hear John Steven and Jason Rouse from Cigital.
This month we have another great speaker lined up. Jeremy Allen, CTO of The
Intrepidus Group, is coming from Atlanta to talk to us about mobile
security assessments.  Intrepidus has also graciously offered to sponsor
the meeting.

All the details can be found on our OWASP site,

We look forward to seeing you at our meetings this year. We have speakers
lined up for the next several months and you can see the lineup on our
site. We are looking for speakers to fill the rest of the year so if you
know of someone please let me know. We are also planning to do either a
round table, fire talk session, or point - counterpoint and we want YOU
involved.

Have a great week and we will see you on the 21st.

I just noticed that Eventbrite was incorrectly identifying our location as
the Gardner school. It is at the regular place, Citi in Blue Ash.

At the last meeting we said that we we going to put together a short poll
that we would like for you to take. It's only 7 questions and shouldn't
take more than 2 or 3 minutes to complete. Please take the poll soon so we
can start making plans as needed.
