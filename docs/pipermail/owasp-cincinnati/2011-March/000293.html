<PRE>Dear OWASP and cincy list members,

 

Thanks for your active participation to the last chapter meetings. We had
averaged 25-30 people attending at each meeting since January that is very
good indeed.

 

I have uploaded the February presentation on Cloud Security on the chapter
web site, please check out.

It will be nice to have a follow up on the topics discussed to see what you
think about Cloud security how will impact your security business/work in
the future.

 

IOActive presentation was also very well received and raised a lot of
questions. It was nice to see the ATM hack live for the first time as remote
from Erlanger to Seattle.  Just need an IP address and port and them boom,
you have ATM rootkit uploaded, pretty amazing staff.

 

I also hope you enjoyed the nice dinner we had, I thought quality of the
food was outstanding, thanks to the sponsorship with IOActive and the
logistics of METS center.

 

Just the heads up, next meeting is march 9th in Blue Ash, we have Jeremiah
Grossman Cot and founder of whitehat security to talk about vulnerability
assessments, it is a great opportunity to know more about application
vulnerabilities and best practices from the experience of 400 companies
doing it.

 

Please RSVP if you have not done it already.

Also think to become OWASP member and be active contributor to the
organization. 

 

Through OWASP, there are a lot of things we can accomplish together and for
the local security community in Cincinnati.

 

Thanks a lot for your follow up on the meetings and participation, look
forward to see you next Wednesday

 

Regards

 

Marco Morana

OWASP Cincinnati
