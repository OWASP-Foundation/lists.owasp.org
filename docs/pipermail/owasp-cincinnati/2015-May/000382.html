&gt;<i> All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this finds each of you doing well. I wanted to reach out to the
</I>&gt;<i> group and try to gauge the general feeling of the group as to our future.
</I>&gt;<i> There have been lots of changes over the last 2 or 3 years in the team that
</I>&gt;<i> has been the core of the group in regards to planning meetings and such. We
</I>&gt;<i> have had people move out of state, change jobs, and other such things that
</I>&gt;<i> has impacted this group. Additionally we have reached out to the group as a
</I>&gt;<i> whole asking for input, ideas, speakers, sponsors, and those willing to
</I>&gt;<i> help with planning and administration of the group. These requests have
</I>&gt;<i> been all but ignored for the most part. We had a couple of people say that
</I>&gt;<i> they were interested in helping out and then shortly after they ended up
</I>&gt;<i> leaving the area. We have had no one that has stepped up with ideas,
</I>&gt;<i> speakers, sponsors, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
At the moment I am in over my head, but I can offer one just random thought
and one concrete idea.

Random thought: I run opensourceplayground.org (OSP). Perhaps we could use
that to publish meeting videos or something. Meeting videos is something we
did at the Raleigh LUG (called TriLUG). We tried to reproduce this in the
Madison LUG and we just didn't have the resources for it. I get that this
is an organization in flux, but just given the size of Cincinnati in
comparison to Madison, I would think Cincy would have a better shot at
being able to find someone with a decent camera and mic. I can talk more
about how we did this at TriLUG if you are interested.

Actually getting content on OSP is one of the things keeping me in over my
head, so this would solve to problems. Obviously, the videos could also go
up on the OWASP site but I don't know if the Cincy group has a separate
site from the main site. If not, I don't know how much access there is to
present things as you would like. OSP was more people, but is currently
just me and this guy in California, so we can basically do what we want
with the domain as far as if you wanted to use something other than the
WordPress and wiki instances we have setup now.

Concrete idea: partner with other Cincinnati user groups. Back when I lived
in Madison, WI I ran the LUG. I brought in the leads of the ruby, python,
etc. groups individually for talks. They were happy to do it because they
were promoting their group. I don't know what Cincinnati groups would be
good, but it would be something to look into. I know for example that there
is a Cincinnati LUG. I've joined some other Cincy groups via meetup

So having said all of this what I need t know is there an interest in
&gt;<i> keeping the chapter alive.
</I>

I am new to the group, but I'd like to see it stick around.


&gt;<i> First let me say that I do not want to see the
</I>&gt;<i> group fade away. I really like organizations such as OWASP and I feel that
</I>&gt;<i> Cincinnati really needs a good, solid IS organization such as OWASP where
</I>&gt;<i> we can come together to learn, share, and network. I understand that
</I>&gt;<i> schedules are busy and that it can be difficult to get away to attend
</I>&gt;<i> meetings. Yet, we do need to make a decision as to the future of the
</I>&gt;<i> Cincinnati Chapter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason that I'm bring all of this up is because we have been approached
</I>&gt;<i> by an organization called SecureWorld about an upcoming event that they are
</I>&gt;<i> hosting in October of this year. It is a one day IS focused conference.
</I>&gt;<i> They want to partner with us for this. Partnership would involve spreading
</I>&gt;<i> the word about the conference, setting up and manning a booth to promote
</I>&gt;<i> our chapter, attending at a discounted rate, and such. I would like for us
</I>&gt;<i> to do this but we have to have an active chapter in order to do this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I need to know a couple of things. Do you support keeping the chapter up
</I>&gt;<i> and running? Will you actively participate when you can? Will you help me
</I>&gt;<i> out with ideas for the group, speakers (this doesn't have to be you but
</I>&gt;<i> someone you know), connect us with sponsors, help with the leadership and
</I>&gt;<i> administration of the group? As I mentioned earlier the group leadership is
</I>&gt;<i> down to just me and I can't do it alone. Even if I had the time the
</I>&gt;<i> leadership team needs to be diverse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a great time to make these decisions for a couple of reasons. First
</I>&gt;<i> is the opportunity to participate in the SecureWorld conference and promote
</I>&gt;<i> not only our chapter but also the IS community in Cincinnati. Second is
</I>&gt;<i> some news related to our long time site sponsor. There are many changes
</I>&gt;<i> coming to the Blue Ash location and in the near future we will not be able
</I>&gt;<i> to meet there. If we are to continue we need to find a new meeting place
</I>&gt;<i> and determine the time of day that we will meet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please get back with me in regards to this. Let me know your thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> either way. If you want to keep the chapter alive please let me know and
</I>&gt;<i> start thinking about what we need to do for the future in regards to
</I>&gt;<i> location, time, and such.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We did another thing in Madison called Geek Dinners. As is probably
obvious, these were more informal than &quot;meetings&quot; but the great thing about
them is that everyone has to eat!

We did this with the Information Science department in Chapel Hill too,
though I think we called it happy hour there. I ran an organization called
the Carolina Open Source Initiative, and we piggy backed on those events.

I suppose this is an idea in itself, but it's more geared at solving the
location problem than the speaker problem, but it might help people get
together in physical space and actually hash out some of the participation
issues.
