<PRE>All,

I hope this finds each of you doing well. I wanted to reach out to the
group and try to gauge the general feeling of the group as to our future.
There have been lots of changes over the last 2 or 3 years in the team that
has been the core of the group in regards to planning meetings and such. We
have had people move out of state, change jobs, and other such things that
has impacted this group. Additionally we have reached out to the group as a
whole asking for input, ideas, speakers, sponsors, and those willing to
help with planning and administration of the group. These requests have
been all but ignored for the most part. We had a couple of people say that
they were interested in helping out and then shortly after they ended up
leaving the area. We have had no one that has stepped up with ideas,
speakers, sponsors, etc...

So having said all of this what I need t know is there an interest in
keeping the chapter alive. First let me say that I do not want to see the
group fade away. I really like organizations such as OWASP and I feel that
Cincinnati really needs a good, solid IS organization such as OWASP where
we can come together to learn, share, and network. I understand that
schedules are busy and that it can be difficult to get away to attend
meetings. Yet, we do need to make a decision as to the future of the
Cincinnati Chapter.

The reason that I'm bring all of this up is because we have been approached
by an organization called SecureWorld about an upcoming event that they are
hosting in October of this year. It is a one day IS focused conference.
They want to partner with us for this. Partnership would involve spreading
the word about the conference, setting up and manning a booth to promote
our chapter, attending at a discounted rate, and such. I would like for us
to do this but we have to have an active chapter in order to do this.

I need to know a couple of things. Do you support keeping the chapter up
and running? Will you actively participate when you can? Will you help me
out with ideas for the group, speakers (this doesn't have to be you but
someone you know), connect us with sponsors, help with the leadership and
administration of the group? As I mentioned earlier the group leadership is
down to just me and I can't do it alone. Even if I had the time the
leadership team needs to be diverse.

This is a great time to make these decisions for a couple of reasons. First
is the opportunity to participate in the SecureWorld conference and promote
not only our chapter but also the IS community in Cincinnati. Second is
some news related to our long time site sponsor. There are many changes
coming to the Blue Ash location and in the near future we will not be able
to meet there. If we are to continue we need to find a new meeting place
and determine the time of day that we will meet.

Please get back with me in regards to this. Let me know your thoughts
either way. If you want to keep the chapter alive please let me know and
start thinking about what we need to do for the future in regards to
location, time, and such.

Regards,
</PRE>
