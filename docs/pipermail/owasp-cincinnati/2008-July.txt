Respectable OWASP Cincinnati Mailing List

 

Dr James Walden presentation on SQL injection was very well received by the

Attendees of the last meeting. Thanks James!

 

We will publish Dr Walden SQL presentation on the site soon, I hope :-)

 

As I said we are looking to presenters and sponsors. OWASP has also plenty
of projects that

You can contribute with and learn.

 

As announced here is the article I co-authored on threat modeling

http://www.net-security.org/dl/insecure/INSECURE-Mag-17.pdf

 

If there is interest I will be happy to present on this on October/November
(other conferences permitting, I had talks to give in

Rochester NY, Italy, Singapore and eventually Portugal)

 

Please keeps your heads up on July 26th presentation on Software Security
Frameworks.

 

Thanks again for your participation and interest to OWASP and happy 4th of
July

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] WebGoat HTTP Splitting Attack Question
Message-ID: <DA235E4D5FD3CE4C8B77382F0837274C48C37A@EXCHMAIL01.corp.medplus.com>

HI there, 

 

Although I successfully completed HTTP Splitting Attack in WebGoat 5.2,
I did not understand a step-by-step behavior of the attack.  I am using
WebScarab to capture all request & response to give me a better idea. 

For example, what does the browser do with the 2nd "made-up" response?
Here is what I did for testing. 

 

First, I put in the query parameter exactly as is given in the hint:

language=?foobar%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK
%0d%0aContent- .........

 

This is the response I got from server below:

 

HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily

Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1

Location:
http://localhost/WebGoat/attack?Screen=2&menu=100&fromRedirect=yes&langu
age=language=?foobar%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%
20OK%0d%0aLast-Modified:%20Wed,%2016%20Jul%202018%2012:55:46%20GMT%0d%0a
Content-Type:%20text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:%2047%0d%0a%0d%0a<html>Ins
ert undesireable content here</html>

Content-Type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1

Content-length: 0

Date: Wed, 16 Jul 2008 13:47:47 GMT

 

Notice that the response does not appear to be split, the 2nd injected
response is still part of the query parameter as shown in "location"
header. Is this a display issue or am I missing something?

 

The browser then generates the next GET request, everything I injected
is now part of GET parameter (if the response is split, I would not see
the injected content being part of the query parameter, right?)

 

GET
http://localhost:80/WebGoat/attack?Screen=2&menu=100&fromRedirect=yes&la
nguage=language=?foobar%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%202
00%2
<http://localhost/WebGoat/attack?Screen=2&menu=100&fromRedirect=yes&lang
uage=language=?foobar%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200
%252> ...........

 

Then, the response from server, the server should respond with the above
GET request, right? But here is what I see, notice that is DIFFERENT
from what I injected because of the additional headers. 

 

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1

Pragma: No-cache

Cache-Control: no-cache

Expires: Wed, 31 Dec 1969 19:00:00 EST

Content-Type: text/html

X-Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Date: Fri, 18 Jul 2008 13:28:52 GMT

Content-length: 45

 

<html>Insert undesireable content here</html>

 

My questions are:

1. I would hope to see two responses being split in the middle like
this. I do not know if this is just a matter of displaying (since the
attack was successful)

 

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        ...
        Set-Cookie: author=Wiley Hacker
        
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        ...

 

2. why is not there a response to the 2nd GET request, but a similar
response to my injected text?

 

Thanks, 

Yan Zhou

I am not familiar with this lesson but I would think to split the
response you would need to inject the CRLF sequence

Did you try that?

I added further resources to conduct the attack herein (*) hope it helps

Marco

Thanks Marco for the documentation, I enjoyed reading the white paper in
particular. 

After debugging through WebGoat, I seem to understand a little better
how the HTTP Splitting lesson is implemented. 

WebGoat does decode the input parameter (which I used %0d%0f for CRLF).
But WebScarab does not decode them, so it reads like %0d%0f on screen
rather than a new line. 

In addition, the HTTP Splitting lesson is designed to look for the
<html> tag in the injected parameter and display everything after it so
that the user gets the sense of it. 

But in the real world, an attacker would issue two requests, with the
2nd request gets matched by the injected response, thus creating an
opportunity to poison the cache. 

Thanks, 
Yan
