<PRE>Happy 2019 OWASP Cincinnati!  Let's kick off the new year with a
presentation pertaining to the anatomy of a data breach with specific focus
on state-level notification requirements as well as broader trends in the
realm of requirements in data security and privacy law.  The meeting will
be held at Paycor's Corporate Office and Pizza will be provided sponsored
by Paycor as well.

Agenda:

&#183;         Speaker Introduction, Topic Overview, and OWASP Relevancy

&#183;         Presentation -  &quot;Where Does It Hurt? - The Anatomy of a Data
Breach&quot; by Zach Briggs

&#183;         Roundtable Discussion Opportunity

&#183;         Housekeeping and Meeting Closure



*Discussion Abstract:*

*Summary:*

Awareness is not understanding. In the age of Google and WebMD, people are
aware of a lot, but they don&#8217;t understand nearly as much. Case in point -
all that causes sickness is not cancer, not all who lose data have had a
breach.



My goal in this presentation is to challenge your understanding of what
makes up a data breach by explaining its full anatomy so that you can
diagnose where it hurts and how to fix it or if you are even sick at all.
All while sharing some of life&#8217;s best medicine (laughter) along the way.



*Biography:*

Zach Briggs is Corporate Compliance Counsel at Paycor, a human capital
management SaaS company based in Cincinnati.  He has a management degree
from Purdue University and his Juris Doctor from Northern Kentucky
University. Zach enjoys seeing how things work and making them work better.
He is responsible for driving compliance initiatives across Paycor&#8217;s entire
organization, but has a special place in his heart for his friends in
InfoSec.
