Dear OWASP members of Cincinnati local chapter

 

As the end of the 2010 is approaching I would like to take this opportunity
to thank you for the support to the chapter to all members and local
organizations.

 

We had several accomplished a lot together and I am looking forward to your
participation in 2011 as well.

 

In particular..

.         we have grown the mailing list to 136 recipients

.         we have several members of the list joining as OWASP members and
funds donated to the local chapter

.         we had held 10 meetings/presentations with top notch security
experts such as Gunter Ollmann and Patrick Gray

.         we had an average participation of 20 people at each meeting

 

For 2011, I am looking forward to boost the chapter profile even more by
inviting application security and software security industry top leaders
among them Dr. Gary McGraw and Jeremiah Grossman

 

In the regard, I am putting together the calendar of speakers events for
2011, if you would like to pledge as speaker or invite a speaker of your
knowledge please let me know.

 

I am also looking for you help in running the chapter with me and help me
organize events and drive membership and participation. Please let me know
if you are interested to serve the chapter as member of the board and
co-lead it with me.

 

Again, think to donate to OWASP with your time or your membership, it is
worthwhile organization to be part of, both for your professional career
andyou're your professional training and skill growth in the area of
application security

 

Happy Holidays and Happy New Year 2011
