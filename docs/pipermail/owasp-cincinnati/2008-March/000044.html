<PRE>Please joint me to welcome John Fellers as member of the OWASP Cincinnati
chapter board

 

I asked John to share a little bio of him with us (*).

John has specific interest in reverse engineering and incident response and
is 

an enthusiastic supporter of OWASP. 

 

I am very happy to have John onboard and I hope that he will be able to get
young and bright engineers like John

to participate to our OWASP chapter meetings.

 

I am looking forward to a prepare a presentation with John on CSRF for the
May meeting.

 

Again welcome to OWASP John

 

Marco Morana
