First of all happy new year 2011. I am putting together a list of speakers
for 2011. Unfortunately I do not have anybody to give a talk, available for
January. 

 

I am willing to cover the January meeting with one of my talks on business
flaw analysis with application threat modeling or set up a video
meeting/forum discussions featuring one of the OWASP Appsec conference
talks. Refer to http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video

 

Also as date for the meeting I am thinking we can gather the last Tuesday of
January that will be the 25th.

 

If you can please let me know:

1)      Which topic you are more interested to cover at OWASP chapter for
2011

2)      If you are you interested on my talk on finding security business
flaws using threat modeling 

3)      If Tuesday 25th  12.00 PM work best for your availability to attend

 

If you please let me know by EOW so I will plan and prepare accordingly

 

Thank you

Marco,

    Thanks for the email and Happy New Year.   There are 2 things on my list of to dos this year that I am interested in and that is the implementation of a vulnerability management system and the other is data loss prevention.   I am interested in topics related to these 2 issues as well as discussions on Security Information and Event Management systems.   I guess what I would like to see as a presentation are best practices for each of these areas and implementation gotchya's and pitfalls.   Other topics of interest would be configuration management and user awareness.

    As of right now the 25th looks ok for me.

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] HTML 5 Security Concerns
Message-ID: <AANLkTim4uYP4F=ZYipN9mtSyhghvYH+wJkXWnskxnXG+@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone on the list deploying HTML 5 applications yet?
Security a Concern as HTML5 Gains
Traction<http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/security-concern-html5-gains-traction-091610>
by Paul Roberts <http://threatpost.com/author/Paul%20Roberts>
http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/security-concern-html5-gains-traction-091610

>From animated logos to Web videos for hip, independent bands, HTML5 is
getting buzz and gaining traction. But concerns about the security of
features in the new version of the Web's *lingua franca* persist.
Every technology innovation has its coming out party, and Google Inc.'s
recent "dancing balls" logo experiment was widely interpreted as a
high-impact debut for the next version of HTML, dubbed HTML5. But web
security experts are warning that the sprawling new Web standard may favor
functionality over security, enabling a new generation of powerful Web based
attacks.

Currently under development by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the
Web's standards-setting organization, the HTML 5 specification
<http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html>is an effort to revamp the Web's
*lingua** **franca** *after its last major makeover, HTML4, in the late
1990s. The new specification adds features that support the kind of rich
interactions and application functions that have become common on the Web,
mostly through the addition of third party tools like Adobe's Flash and
Microsoft's Silverlight platforms. Among the additions to HTML5 are new
elements and APIs that will enable two dimensional drawing, native rendering
of video and audio files, drag and drop capabilities and offline
capabilities for Web applications using local storage and databases.

HTML5 has some major backers, among them: search giant Google. In addition
to its eye catching logo animations, that company has lent development
talent to the development of HTML5 with projects like the Arcade Fire Web
video "the Wilderness Downtown," which highlight the capabilities of
Google's Chrome Browser, and which Google promoted on its
blog<http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/arcade-fire-meets-html5.html>.
The company has also created a Web site,
HTML5rocks.com<http://www.html5rocks.com/>,
to extol the virtues of the new version of HTML.

The new standard does make strides in plugging up some gaping security
issues inherited from earlier versions of HTML, said Adam Barth of the
University of California, Berkeley, who has been involved with the
development of the new specification.

For one thing, HTML5 actually specifies how HTML code should be parsed by
Web browsers. Previous iterations of the language left it up to individual
platform vendors to develop their own interpretations of how the code should
be parsed, which led to differences in how the language was rendered on
different browsers. That also created opportunities for attackers to exploit
quirks in the HTML parsing of specific browsers in Cross Site Scripting and
other Web based attacks, Barth wrote in an e-mail response to questions from
Threatpost.

New features are also intended to make HTML5 more secure than its
predecessors. Among them is a new sandbox attribute that allows Web sites
that use iFrames to aggregate untrusted content from external sources to run
it in a secured environment. The postMessage() feature, for cross document
messaging, allows secure communication between different web sites in the
browser, Barth said.

Web security experts contacted by Threatpost agree that there are security
enhancements in HTML5, but all expressed the same concern: that the new
specification will greatly increase the "attack surface" of HTML - providing
more avenues by which malicious code can be delivered through the Web.

"HTML5 has an enormous amount of functionality. The (specification) is just
huge," said Jeremiah Grossman of Web security firm WhiteHat. The breadth of
the new specification gives him concern. "I know that we're still finding
vulnerabilities in HTML4," Grossman said.

Others echoed that concern.

"With any new functionality you're going to have new security concerns.
HTML5 is going to increase the attack surface considerably," said Neil
Daswani of Web security firm Dasient.

Though no specific vulnerabilities or attacks against HTML5-specific
features are documented, experts point to a few areas of concern:

Local, database and session storage: More options for storing user data
locally will make it easier to develop Web applications that can also work
in offline environments. They'll also reduce the reliance on session cookies
and improve the performance of Web based applications, which can retrieve
data locally instead of having to make requests out to a Web server and
retrieve the results.

The conventional wisdom has been that these sensitive data stores will be a
rich target for malicious hackers who might leverage cross site scripting
attacks or other means to siphon sensitive data from them. Security experts
we talked to played down that threat, noting that local storage has been
around for a long time with technologies like Flash. However, engineers at
Veracode in May raised warnings about an implementation issue with the
sessionStorage<http://www.veracode.com/blog/2010/05/html5-security-in-a-nutshell/>feature
that could make it vulnerable to manipulation from untrusted Web
sites.

The new sandboxing and postMessage() features are examples of tools that, if
not used properly, could fail to provide protection against hacks, or even
enable new types of attacks. Veracode, in its analysis of HTML5,  raised red
flags about the security of the postMessage() feature, as well, noting that
Web applications that use cross-document messaging could be vulnerable to
attack from malicious Web sites, which could spoof rogue messages.

Even features, like postMessage() designed to improve security could
actually make Web sites less secure if they're implemented incorrectly, said
Isaac Dawson, a security researcher at Veracode.

"As with any security functionality, over reliance or simple misuse of it
could unknowingly make a site less secure," he wrote.
In addition, HTML5's ability to support native rendering of audio and video
files could allow attackers to take advantage of security vulnerabilities in
supported audio and video file formats for Web based attacks.

"I imagine we'll see a lot of people building custom fuzzers for the
supported video codecs," said Dawson. That will put the onus on the Web
browser makers themselves - Microsoft, Google, Mozilla and Apple - to review
the code used for video parsing and rendering heavily to prevent them from
being exploited, he said.

Grossman, of WhiteHat, also worries about the ripple effects of HTML5
adoption. In particular, the way that new HTML features will break or
disable Web security filters that are designed to block malicious activity.
In just one example, he notes that HTML5's broader support of event handlers
on HTML elements could defeat blacklist filters designed to allow HTML but
block scripting.

Still, with the HTML5 not finalized and adoption still in its infancy, the
full impact of the specification - for good and bad - won't be felt for
years, experts agreed.

Grossman said he sees support for HTML5 in around 10% to 12% of the 2,000
Web sites his firm monitors. It could be three years or more before the
security implications of the new capabilities in HTML5 are fully grasped, he
said.

However, HTML5 features could start working their way into the fabric of the
Web long before wholesale adoption of the new standard, as Web sites look to
take advantage of features, like local storage, on browsers that can support
it, Grossman said.

"Honestly, I think it will make some things better," said Dawson of
Veracode. "But as with all technologies it's going to take a while for
the repercussions of certain designs to be fully known."
