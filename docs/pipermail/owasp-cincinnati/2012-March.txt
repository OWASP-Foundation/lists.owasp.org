Who: Michael Farnum, Security Advocate for Accuvant
Abstract: The Danger of the Security ASS-umption

Many enterprise technical security assessments look at too few attack
vectors or do not dig far enough into the attack vectors once a
vulnerability has been discovered. This is often due to risk ASSumptions
that are made by security staff / management, and these ASSumptions often
cause failures in findings. Come join a discussion on the breakdown of a
technical security assessment, explore the essential attack vectors, and
debate the depth to which the assessment should go.
