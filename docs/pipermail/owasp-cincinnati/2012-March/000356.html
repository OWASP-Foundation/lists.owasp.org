Who: Michael Farnum, Security Advocate for Accuvant
Abstract: The Danger of the Security ASS-umption

Many enterprise technical security assessments look at too few attack
vectors or do not dig far enough into the attack vectors once a
vulnerability has been discovered. This is often due to risk ASSumptions
that are made by security staff / management, and these ASSumptions often
cause failures in findings. Come join a discussion on the breakdown of a
technical security assessment, explore the essential attack vectors, and
debate the depth to which the assessment should go.
Speaker Bio:

Michael is the Security Advocate for Accuvant. Michael has over 17 years
experience in IT and security, specializing in security infrastructure
design and information security management. A skilled communicator, Michael
is a well known security blogger and podcaster. Michael has spoken on
various security topics at several conferences and events across the United
States. He holds several security and technology certifications, including
the ever-controversial CISSP. Prior to joining Accuvant, Michael was the
Information Security Manager at The Menninger Clinic in Houston, TX. Before
that, Michael performed random acts of security lunacy at companies all
over Houston, TX.
