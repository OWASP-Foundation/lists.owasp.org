We're a week away from this year's SecureWorld event. If you haven't registered there is still time. events.secureworldexpo.com/details/cincinnati-oh-2017/

I have discount codes that you can use to save either $100 off the SecureWorld Plus event which starts on Monday the 23rd and includes an extra full day of focused training. The code for that is OWASPP

Or if you can only go to the main event on Tuesday you can save $50 by using the code OWASP

I hope to see some of you there. We will have a OWASP table again this year so stop by and say hi.
