Presentation Topic: An Empirical Study of Web Application Security Trends
Dr. James Walden Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science Northern
Kentucky University What is the current state of web application security?
Are web applications more or less secure than they were last year? This
presentation will attempt to answer those questions through an empirical
study of popular open source web applications over the past two years. Data
and statistics on vulnerability density, vulnerability types, and
vulnerability severities will be analyzed, along with software metrics that
may reflect application security. 

Presenter Bio James Walden is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at
Northern Kentucky University. He is the author of a number of papers on
software security and has given talks and workshops on secure programming
and software security at a variety of conferences. He teaches graduate and
undergraduate classes in information and software security at NKU and offers
regular software security workshops to professionals through NKU's
Infrastructure Management Institute. Dr. Walden received his Ph.D. from
Carnegie Mellon University in 1997. He then worked at Intel as a software
engineer, with a focus on security sensitive applications, for five years.
Prior to coming to NKU, he was a Visiting Professor of Computer Science and
Engineering at the University of Toledo.
