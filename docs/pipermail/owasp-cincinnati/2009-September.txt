Since no one is speaking up about your attendance concerns perhaps I
could offer a perspective.

I am a software developer who is very interested in the prospect of
improving how we integrate security in the products we build. To that
end I am able to monitor this list, try to understand the issues at
hand and the attend meetings when I can.

1)  The meeting time is the biggest problem. Being able to allocate
drive time, meeting time and eating time in the middle of the day is
close to impossible. The meetings I have attended were at times when
my clients were located just around the corner from you but in most
cases, I can expect a 15 to 20 minute drive before and after the
meeting.

I attend 3 or 4 other user group meetings a month that meet around the
6pm time frame. For me, planning evenings is easier than lunch times.
Certainly, I understand that this must very greatly for your audience.

2) Meeting content doesn't address, in a practical way, what software
developers need to do to improve. Instead, the focus appears to be on
the security professional and the processes that can be used within an
organization.

This may, of coarse, be intentional, and I am just not the target
audience of OWASP. However, what I would like to achieve, by
attending, is to find a way to include security into the SDLC to
augment what I do.

This blog entry reflects some of my thinking the subject and why it is
unlikely that I will become better at securing the products I build.

    http://esumerfield.blogspot.com/2009/06/security-and-quality-through-testing-or.html

There is a fundamental misunderstanding about how our industry can
address these issues. The best illustration of this came from a talk
Gary McGraw gave at NKU a few years ago. I asked the question, "How
can I, a tech lead on a project, improve the security of the software
that my team produces?". His answer, "kick the developers ass". It got
some laughs but, from my perspective, this appears to reflect the
general attitude that security professionals have towards software
developers.

I wish I had a better answer or even a better question. Maybe if I
could make it to a few more meetings everything would become clear :-)

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] RSVP For Tomorrow Meeting (Will Smith) and
	questions Ed broughtup.
In-Reply-To: <BC6ACD30F00C0F4C882500F7FBF7DBCF010AC3CB@CINEXMB1.WS.WSFGRP.NET>
References: <mailman.37.1252425611.712.owasp-cincinnati@lists.owasp.org>

It is pretty typical that people don't respond to massages about poor
attendance. I think it's a psychological thing. Anyway, I was not able
to attend last week because I was out of town in Massachusetts. While I
did find the topic something of interest, I didn't think it cost
effective to fly to Cincinnati for an hour meeting and fly back. 

Special note: summers are notorious for poor attendance. 

So, Ed, to your questions:

1) maybe a mix of evening and afternoon meetings would be better. I know
that lunch is better for me, but may not be for others. The question
would then arise as to if the location would accommodate a 6pm time. Or
if 6pm is good, what with rush hour and all. It's at least worth
discussion.

As for OWASP meeting topics, some of the ones I have attended have been
useful on the programming level, and some at the security profession
level. Maybe Marco could add a "target audience" to the announcement to
help clarify who the topic is geared for. That might help you prioritize
which meetings you should attend. Just a suggestion.

2) As an auditor, I have to ask the same question you are... How do you
create a process in the SDLC that includes security as a component? One
place that to start is the education of programmers in secure
programming practices. Most security articles and training is focused on
reverse engineering, i.e. try to break the code, fix it, try to break it
again. There are some SANS classes on secure programming but these are
expensive on a tight budget. 

There are a few tidbits to garner about the subject reading the OWASP
Wiki. There are also tools on the Wiki you can use to try and do the
reverse engineering stuff on your web program. Learning how to use them
is a hurtle but, once you do,  it is a process you can insert into your
SDLC. Plan, Code, Test (functions and security) and recode if necessary,
QA, Publish. That is pretty much the (Secure)SDLC model in a nut-shell.
What usually gets missed is security, unless it is a specific security
function you are testing. The idea of secure programming tests is
testing outside the box; what can you do that isn't designed? It
increases the time in test, but your end result is much more secure. If
you have a security team members who are good at using exploitation
tools, you can involve them in the SDLC to cut down on time and/or
decrease the amount of exploits in your final product.

So far, I haven't seen any company do an (S)SDLC effectively with every
project. In project management, you have the triangle of Cost, Resources
and Time. Adding in the security test component usually increases time,
probably increases cost, and definitely requires more skilled resources.
So when Gary McGraw said "kick the developers ass" he really needed to
say "kick the sponsor ass and get the time, money and resources to do it
properly". Yes, many developers are all to often lazy or ignorant of the
risks, but it's the sponsors of the project who really need to
understand that 1) security is needed 2) security is going to cost more
in time, money and resources and 3) if we don't do it right, we will
just have to do it again later and lose the company money, at best, and
reputation ,at worst. 

For some input (if you haven't seen this yet)
http://www.sans.org/top25errors/#s4 list 25 of the most dangerous errors
in programming. It's at least a start. 

Another item is
http://www.safecode.org/publications/SAFECode_Dev_Practices1108.pdf
published last year which has some good information as well. 

I hope this helps.

Hi Ed

Thanks for your input, I appreciate any positive or negative and I think
yours is mostly positive. Let me reply point to point briefly:
1) I will move the next meeting to the evening 6 PM to accommodate other
attendees schedule as well
2) Content of the meetings. I am sorry did not address what you are looking
for, this year topics have been democratically selected from the survey I
did back at the beginning of the calendar
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#OWASP_Chapter_Meeting_Topics_Selec
tion_For_2009_.28Mailing_List_Poll.29
I hope I can fit some of the topics of your interest in next year calendar
3) regarding Gary's colorful take on developers..I do not think Gary
seriously think that as he does not think I hope that all Italian are
communists.. it might said that as provocation for a discussion. If you look
at the BSIMM (http://www.bsi-mm.com/) that Gary created certainly has
developers need consideration on what it takes to get software security,
least not last training software developers and provide them tools and
processes.

Regarding the "industry" misunderstanding on how to build security in and
what it takes, I think the mission of OWASP is exactly to make sure it is
understood what it takes in terms of process, people and tools. Nevertheless
you might argue that we are making or not making progress. 

I invite you to take this as topic for conversation to one of the next
forums if you are interested

Hope this help, thanks

Marco

Gary McGraw gave at NKU a few years ago. I asked the question, "How can
I, a tech lead on a project, improve the security of the software that
my team produces?". His answer, "kick the developers ass". It got some
laughs but, from my perspective, this appears to reflect the general
attitude that security professionals have towards software developers.

I wish I had a better answer or even a better question. Maybe if I could
make it to a few more meetings everything would become clear :-)

A couple more thoughts.

1)  When teaching subjects targeted at software developers what about
doing it as an outreach to each user group in town. If you go to the
CinJUG or CinNUG groups you are guaranteed a 30+ attendance. Then
there are PHP, Ruby, Python, SQL and on and on. Every technology has
it's enthusiasts and none of them come to OWASP meetings.

This approach would allow developers to see the practical side of the
problem. The Top 25 is an awesome resource but how does it impact them
in their daily life. How do I write my code to satisfy the boss and
the security ideal that they usually don't care about.

You could look at it as an annual OWASP outreach program. You built
it, they didn't come, so we better go to them :-)

2) From an advertising perspective, there is a new resource in town
called tech-life. We had a big meeting of all the user groups in town
and agreed to share our schedules in a common location so that it's
easier to everyone to get a central picture of what is going on.
Perhaps OWASP could adds it's info there as well.

I've given a few security talks at user groups and they have been well
received.  I think this type of outreach is a good idea for OWASP.

Thanks for the link.   I had wished that Cincinnati had something like
Portland's Calagator--their user groups got together and wrote an open
source web app to track their combined events.  It's at
http://calagator.org/.

Than for the techlife link, I already subscribed to it. I agree with you
that we need to reach out on the software developer community here in
Cincinnati and I appreciate your help.

Regards

Marco

p.s. our OWASP chapter has a board but I would like to get people with truly
interest on OWASP to be part of it so if you of any of the list would like
to be part your are quite welcome. Ideally we meet once a month at Panera in
Blue Ash.

Presentation: Strategies for Effectively Securing Internet Transactions:
Businesses, Consumers and the Cloud, Nicholas Stamos corporate president and
a co-founder of  <http://www.verdasys.com> Verdasys Inc 

Presentation Abstract 

The internet has become a phenomenal means for companies to conduct high
volume, low cost transactions with customers from around the globe. It has
reduced internal system and application costs through Saas and Paas and
offers even great savings and efficiencies as cloud computing environments
mature and deploy in greater volume. However, with the growing volume and
wealth of transactions moving through and being stored on the World-Wide
Web, Internet transactional security is now a critical concern for both
consumers and companies alike. The volume of fraudulent transactions,
incidents of invasion and cyber crime are all accelerating. According to
both information security experts and law enforcement officials, these
attacks are almost always the work of organized and well-financed criminal
organizations. Hear Verdasys President and Co-Founder, Nicholas Stamos
explain real world strategies for combating these growing threats and
discuss processes that when put in place can offer true protection for your
company and customers against the ever evolving world cyber threats. 

Presenter Bio

Presentation: Strategies for Effectively Securing Internet Transactions:
Businesses, Consumers and the Cloud, Nicholas Stamos corporate president and
a co-founder of  <http://www.verdasys.com> Verdasys Inc 

Presentation Abstract 

The internet has become a phenomenal means for companies to conduct high
volume, low cost transactions with customers from around the globe. It has
reduced internal system and application costs through Saas and Paas and
offers even great savings and efficiencies as cloud computing environments
mature and deploy in greater volume. However, with the growing volume and
wealth of transactions moving through and being stored on the World-Wide
Web, Internet transactional security is now a critical concern for both
consumers and companies alike. The volume of fraudulent transactions,
incidents of invasion and cyber crime are all accelerating. According to
both information security experts and law enforcement officials, these
attacks are almost always the work of organized and well-financed criminal
organizations. Hear Verdasys President and Co-Founder, Nicholas Stamos
explain real world strategies for combating these growing threats and
discuss processes that when put in place can offer true protection for your
company and customers against the ever evolving world cyber threats.

	Presentation/Speaker for Tomorrow Meeting
Message-ID: <4ac16218.c6c1f10a.1374.1eeb@mx.google.com>

Folks

 

Bad news, unfortunately Nick Stamos (president and founder of Verdasys Inc)
had a family emergency so he could not come to Cincinnati for tomorrow
meeting .

 

Therefore I had to pull out his presentation.

 

The good news is that Verdasys will still pay for PIZZA J 

 

To cover the meeting I have decided to present my topic :" The rise of
threat analysis and the fall of compliance, in mitigating cybercrime risks"

This is a presentation I did two weeks ago for OWASP at Symantec campus in
LA and University of Irvine . 

 

The presentation was very well received so I hope you will too and not
change your mind coming tomorrow.

 

More details about the topic of presentation are included herein:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cincinnati#Upcoming_September_Meeting

 

Anyway, hope to see you tomorrow despite the much less glamorous speaker J

 

Regards
