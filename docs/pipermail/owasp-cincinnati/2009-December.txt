Dear OWASP Cincinnati List

 

As you might have notice because of the lack of previous announcement, we
won't held a meeting this month

as most of you will probably be already or about to enjoy your Christmas
holidays.

 

I would like to  get the opportunity to wish you Merry Christmas/Happy
Festivities to you and your families and please beware of un-safe web sites
when shopping on-line J

 

With best regards

 

Marco Morana

 

p.s. I will post announcements for next year calendar, if there are any
topics you would like to be covered as well as any speakers you would like
me to invite please let me know
