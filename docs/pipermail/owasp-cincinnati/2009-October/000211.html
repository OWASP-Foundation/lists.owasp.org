<PRE>Well there is no really agreement all across the map on how much  is insider
threat comparing with outside.

 

Verizon study for example reports  that only 20% of breaches were caused by
insiders

.pdf

 

The ITRC study reports 15.7% in 2008 and 18% in 2009

<A HREF="http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/m_press/2008_Data_Breach_Totals">http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/m_press/2008_Data_Breach_Totals</A>

heft_Summary_20090930.pdf

 

The 80% comes from quoting a 17 years old study from FBI

ml

 

The 2007 e-Crime survey reports a 49% in 2007 in declining trend but that
was before we had the economy in depression

<A HREF="http://www.cert.org/insider_threat/">http://www.cert.org/insider_threat/</A>

 

According to datalossdb.org inside count for overall of 30% of attack
vectors 65% from outside and 5% unknown

Thanks Sachin and James for the replies.  We are responding to an RFP for a
large project that will sit inside of a large network.  The comments and
resources will certainly help make the case for making security a higher
priority when speaking with the administrative folks that are putting
together the proposal.

Thanks again for the input!

Subject: [Owasp-cincinnati] Addressing security in the workplace

 

I was hoping that someone could point me to a few resources.  One of the
common thought processes that I am seeing at work has become &quot;This
application is strictly internal, so we don't need to worry about security&quot;.
I know that security inside the perimeter should be of significant concern,
and have found some tech talks and ebooks that suggest up to 80% of attacks
come from inside the corporate network.  Is this an accurate number?
Furthermore, if anyone has any thoughts or resources to share on this
subject, and particularly strategies for eliminating this mindset in the
workplace, I would be very interested to hear them.

Thanks,

Brad Gardner
