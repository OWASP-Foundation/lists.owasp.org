I've seen wildly different numbers for insider attacks; I tend to
believe the numbers suggesting relatively low numbers like 10% because
of the constant probing systems experience from external attackers. If
someone said that 80% of successful attacks were from the inside, I
could believe that, as insiders are more likely to conduct targetted
attacks and have more knowledge of the target before beginning.

That said, it's worth remembering for web attacks that the firewall
means little when an attacker can use Javascript they tricked another
site to host to cause an internal user to portscan and fingerprint the
network from the inside, then launch targetted attacks on the
identified web servers.
