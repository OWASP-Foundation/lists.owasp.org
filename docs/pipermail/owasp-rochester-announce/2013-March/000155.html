as a Professional Penetration Testing Technique Ralph will briefly discuss
Ethical Hacking (EH) and Penetration Testing (PT), why they are important
and how they differ. He will talk about the ethical hacking mindset and the
ethical hacking process and why it's important as a professional
penetration testing meta-technique. The presentation will then apply the EH
process with audience participation on exploiting sample vulnerabilities of
both servers and clients. The examples will cover several specific, yet
basic tools and techniques that continue to be effective in the
exploitations of systems, applications and clients. Of course he'll also
briefly discuss how to defend against these attacks. Although the cool
tools and sexy exploits tend to get much of the attention when it comes to
penetration testing, the focus will be on the ethical hacking as a
meta-technique and how it can be applied to maximize the usefulness of the
results to the hiring organization. The presentation will also cover some
common misconceptions, mistakes, ethical issues and non-professionalisms
that continue to trouble the profession. Bio Ralph Durkee is the principal
