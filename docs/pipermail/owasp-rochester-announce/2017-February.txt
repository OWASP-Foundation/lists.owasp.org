Want to learn more about the security challenges developers face? This

common application vulnerabilities. You?ll see the attack in action, learn
how the attack works, learn how it can be prevented, and watch a successful
defensive counter.

This session will be covering the following components of the OWASP Top 10:

A1 ? Injection
A3 ? Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
A8 ? Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
A10 ? Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

The source code used in the demo is freely available and uses a Java/JEE
stack.
