In the meantime, the Austin chapter is providing a virtual meeting via GoToMeeting with Matt Tesauro, a board member of the OWASP foundation and leader of many projects, including the OWASP Live CD. This is a new experiment for our chapter, so please don't forget to send us your feedback!


When: February 28, 2012  from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM CST (12:30PM to 2:00PM EST)

Description: Testing From the Cloud: Is the Sky Falling?

More and more IT is being moved to the cloud, why shouldn't your testing move there too? This talk will cover what it takes to take your testing tools from your laptop to the cloud using new features of the OWASP Web Testing Environment (WTE). WTE allows you to create custom installations of application security tools in the cloud on demand. Has your IP been shunned? No problem, kill that cloud instance and startup another. Is your life as mobile as your phone? No problem, a laptop + Internet = access to all your favorite tools from anywhere. Multiple clients? No problem, start an an instance for each one. By the end of this talk, you'll know all you need to fire up an cloud instance with all of your favorite tools and start having fun.

Speaker: Matt Tesauro

Matt is currently on the board of the OWASP Foundation and highly involved in many OWASP projects and committees. Matt is the project leader of the OWASP WTE (Web Testing Environment) which is the source of the OWASP Live CD Project and Virtual Machines pre-configured with tools and documentation for testing web applications. Industry designations include the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). Matt Tesauro has a B.S. in Economics and a M.S in Management Information Systems from Texas A&M University.
