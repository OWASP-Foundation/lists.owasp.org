<PRE>OWASP Rochester Chapter has been invited by Digital Rochester to be  
part of
their October 2nd networking event. Get Connected! is Digital  
Rochester's
annual event that gathers a select group of networking and service  
organizations
from around the region in order to make connections that can benefit the
greater Rochester community. Some are hard-core techies, others more  
social,
many have a mission that could inspire you to get involved! Come to  
learn more
about the organizations and to meet some of Rochester's most interesting
professionals as we all Get Connected!

WHEN: Tuesday, October 2nd, 5:30 - 8:00 pm
WHERE: Village Gate, 2nd floor atrium
        274 North Goodman Street

Eighteen (or more!) groups will be there to share information about  
their
organizations and the ways in which people can get involved with some of
their activities. We'll have a table, but as you mix with the crowd, be
sure to help us spread the word about OWASP!

There'll be light refreshments from Salena's Mexican Restaurant, free  
beer
- while it lasts - courtesy of High Falls and Wright Wisner, and a  
cash bar
with soda and wine!
There's no charge to attend.

For more info visit: <A HREF="http://www.digitalrochester.com/details.php">http://www.digitalrochester.com/details.php</A>

Bring a friend! Meet some new people! We'll see you there!
