*Hands-on Ethical Hacking: Preventing and Exploiting Stack Overflow
Vulnerabilities*

We'll have a hands-on Ethical Hacking training session on preventing and
exploiting stack overflow vulnerabilities.  In the session we'll discuss
how to find a buffer overflow vulnerability and then develop a
customized exploit for a stack based buffer overflow.  We'll also
discuss and test mitigating techniques such as address randomization,
stack protections mechanisms, non-executable stacks and of course secure
programming to prevent buffer overflows. 

The course will use a virtual Linux system with the required tools
running on your own laptop.  Attendees should be comfortable with the
Linux command line, and be familiar with basic C/C++ programming.  We'll
be using the Gnu development tools such as gcc, gdb, and make. Vim,
Emacs and Eclipse will all be installed for your editing and exploit
writing pleasure. You must bring your own laptop. The laptop can be MS
Windows, Mac or Linux, just make sure you have a recent version of
VirtualBox installed and working.   Having a DVD reader is recommended
for transferring the VM, but we will also have a single shared USB DVD
drive available.

*Laptop Requirements: *
At least 4Gb RAM

  * 20 Gb of free disk space
  * Recent version of Virtual Box installed and working.
  * Administrator or root privileges for the laptop.
