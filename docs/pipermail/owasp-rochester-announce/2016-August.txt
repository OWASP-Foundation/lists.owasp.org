The OWASP AppSec USA conference is scheduled Oct 13-14 in Wash. DC with 
training Oct 11-12th.  It's a great event to advance your skills and 
meet your peers. I'm planning to attend as I do most every year.   
There's a $50 discount for OWASP paid members.

Let me know if you have any questions about the event.
