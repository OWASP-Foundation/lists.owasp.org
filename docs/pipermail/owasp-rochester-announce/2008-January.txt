Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] January meeting, change of date: Thursday,
	January 24th
Message-ID: <DF0B6E33-06EF-4DA7-B453-0E736F47BF34@dollos.it>

OWASP January meeting, formerly scheduled for Monday, January 21st  
has been postponed to Thursday, January 24th due to the Martin Luther  
King Jr. Day. We are sorry for this change of plan on such a short  
notice and we hope this won't cause any inconvenience to you. We look  
forward to seeing you at Bryant & Stratton College on Thursday  
January 24th at 6pm.

A couple of security training books will be given away to the attendees.

We'll follow up Steve's November presentation on SQL Injection and  
see what happens when we have to deal with dynamic queries.


Presenter: Andrea Cogliati

Topic: Dynamic SQL and SQL Injection

We will discuss the need for dynamic SQL and dynamic queries in web  
applications and related issues. Then we will show how to safely  
create dynamic queries in the data access layer and in stored  
procedures. Java and C# examples will be used to access SQL Server  
and MySQL databases.

Bio: Andrea Cogliati is a security trainer and consultant focusing in  
application security. He's worked as a programmer, system and network  
administrator also. Andrea holds a degree in Mathematics from Scuola  
Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy.

Attendance to the meeting is free and open to anyone.
