*Presentation: NodeJS Security*

NodeJS has become an industry standard for deploying agile web
applications. This talk provides an introduction to NodeJS &#8211; what it is,
what it isn&#8217;t, how to get it running, and common elements that get
deployed with Node (such as Grunt and Bower). With a firm understanding
of the platform, we'll then examine common problems and security risks
associated with NodeJS applications, as well as what options are
currently available to secure and audit NodeJS projects.


Come join your friends and bring your colleagues for a great
presentation, food, good drink, and fun conversation.
