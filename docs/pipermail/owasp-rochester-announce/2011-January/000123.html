<PRE>*Rochester OWASP Chapter Meeting Reminder*

* *

Monday is our next meeting! Refreshments will be provided by Mykonos.

* *

*When:* January 17th



*Location:* Mykonos (Blue Tie) at 220 Kenneth Dr, Rochester, NY (entrance
from Lehigh Station Rd or W Henrietta Rd), near 390 and Lehigh Station Road

* *

*Abstract:*
*State of OWASP and the State of Web Application Security*
A quick update on OWASP, and what is happening? And of course plans for the
2011 OWASP Global Summit. We&#8217;ll do a quick overview of OWASP AppSec DC 2010
conference, and then talk about the State of Application Security which will
include information from the conference. I&#8217;ll do an overview of current
state and trends as well as tools and techniques that are in use, and
discuss their cost effectiveness. I&#8217;d like to spend some time with some
interactive discussion on some meaty questions like:

Where are we and where should we be headed? Are we making progress? In what
areas are we as an application security industry doing better, and where is
improvement needed. How has the risks changed? Are we getting ahead of or
keeping up with the threats? Are there major changes needed or helpful to
&#8220;fix&#8221; the application security profession?
