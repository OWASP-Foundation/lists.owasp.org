*Understanding and Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks*

Ranked #8 on the OWASP Top 10, ?Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an
attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web
application in which they're currently authenticated.? (OWASP Wiki)

CSRF vulnerabilities are commonplace and easily missed by developers who
are unfamiliar with this class of attack. Unlike injection
vulnerabilities, they do not become apparent during testing unless you
know exactly what to look for. This session will provide an introduction
to CSRF vulnerabilities, and will include an attack demonstration and
practical examples that prevent this type of vulnerability.

Come join your friends and bring your colleagues for a great
presentation, food, good drink, and fun conversation.

*Speaker: *John King
