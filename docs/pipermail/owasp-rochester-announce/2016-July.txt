Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] Jeremiah Grossman Article
Message-ID: <577B0696.3020305@rd1.net>

Jeremiah has a very interesting article in the Australia CIO mag about 
application security, Ransomware, SDLC and endpoint security. It takes a 
big picture approach to discuss the biggest risks we face, in addition 
to AppSec.

http://www.cio.com.au/article/602779/jeremiah-grossman-focus-ransomware-sdlc-endpoints/

Jeremiah will be keynoting at the Rochester Security Summit in October, 
where we will have an OWASP track of speakers.  The event generally 
sells out so don't wait too long to get your ticket. 
https://www.rochestersecurity.org/

If you'd like to speak on OWASP / Application Security topic at an OWASP 
meeting or at the Summit, please let me know.
