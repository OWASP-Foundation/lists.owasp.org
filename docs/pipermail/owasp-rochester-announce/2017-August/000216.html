<PRE>Here's information on the up coming AppSec USA conference and Training...
-- Ralph

We will have a number of upcoming opportunities for Community members 
(including volunteer opportunities in exchange for tickets to the 
conference).  Ticket prices for AppSec USA will be going up on August 
16th and training classes are going quickly.


Hands On Pre-Conference Training

It&#8217;s one thing to hear from leading technology professionals and 
pioneers at an information and applications securities conference &#8230; but 
nothing beats hands on, immersive learning and training opportunities 
led by those same thought leaders and change makers. Imagine stepping 
away from your desk for two full days to explore application security 
automation alongside CTO of We45, Abhay Bhargav, or identifying security 
risks by hacking into IoT devices during an afternoon with Aditya Gupta, 
Founder and CEO of Attify. What if you could collaborate with global 
industry experts on open-source defensive security techniques and 
practice mitigating mobile app attacks in a real-life test environment?

During the first two days of OWASP&#8217;s 14thannual AppSecUSA conference in 
Orlando, Florida from September 19 &#8211; 22, 2017, you can. Guests will have 
the opportunity to participate in two full-day, self-guided training 
sessions with other attendees and speakers such as Sebastien 
Deleersnyder, Managing Partner and co-founder of Belgian securities 
company Toreon, and many more. These pre-conference training days will 
set the tone for OWASP&#8217;s signature AppSecUSA event, which showcases 
cutting edge lectures and keynote sessions featuring securities experts 
from around the world in a friendly, interactive environment.

Explore the full training and lecture schedule 
here:<A HREF="https://appsecusa2017.sched.com/,">https://appsecusa2017.sched.com/,</A> or preview the conference&#8217;s 
announced speakers list 
&lt;<A HREF="https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/6898e6ec-022c-474f-a3fb-de95c231d93b/appsecusa2017-sched-com-directory-speakers">https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/6898e6ec-022c-474f-a3fb-de95c231d93b/appsecusa2017-sched-com-directory-speakers</A>&gt;. 
The conference is just a month and a half away, with registration 
tickets going fast and hotel accommodations filling up even faster. 
Don&#8217;t miss OWASP&#8217;s exclusive opportunity to learn from and rub elbows 
with the most senior security developers and experts out there.  No 
matter what industry you&#8217;re in, or where you live, this exciting, 
international conference is the place to be as a security and 
information leader.

Best,

Tiffany Long
Community Manager
