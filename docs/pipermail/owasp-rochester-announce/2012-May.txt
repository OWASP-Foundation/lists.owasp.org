May OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting.

When: Tuesday, May 29th, from 11:30 AM -1:00 PM CST

Topic: Closing the Window of Opportunity

?Closing the window of opportunity? and will be discussing the state of web application security based on recent statistics drawn from WhiteHat?s database of thousands of sites under service and the characteristics of a program that can help organizations develop a strong web security posture and reduce or eliminate the opportunities attackers have to compromise their applications.

This will be a product agnostic presentation, of course, though we will be using WhiteHat data (along with Jim?s long experience) to present the problems we see and how we can go about solving them.

Speaker(s):

He worked with a small software company working on an early rapid application development tool that produced code from UML diagrams, a small nonprofit on a tool to permit English and Chinese speakers to study the bible in its original tongues without learning those ancient languages, and a couple Fortune 500 companies helping them process, utilize, and analyze their financial data.
