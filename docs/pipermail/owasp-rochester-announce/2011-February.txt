> As you can see by the Summit's highlights, we achieved an amazing amount of work during the 3 days we were together in Portugal! 
> 
> Amazingly, we also had a great time, and created/consolidated an enormous amount of friendships/relationships. Just look at the the number of similes (and focused faces) that exist on the Summit's official photo album: https://picasaweb.google.com/owaspphotos/OWASPSummit

> I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Summit organization team, the Working Session chairs, the 180 on-site participants and the 1000s remote participants, for working so hard and achieving so much.
