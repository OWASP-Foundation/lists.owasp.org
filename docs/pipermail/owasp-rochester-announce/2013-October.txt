The Rochester Security Summit coming up in 2 weeks  (Oct 22-23) is done
in partnership with the Rochester OWASP Chapter.
If you're able to come and help promote the chapter at the event, please
let me know.  We'll have a table and literature there, and some give
aways.  Also if you're a paid OWASP member let me know and we'll get you
a discount code.

Here's the info.

Don't wait to register or it's likely to be too late.
