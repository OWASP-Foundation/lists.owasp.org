DESCRIPTION:We'll have some brief news and chapter business followed by a 
 presentation by Larry Kovnat. Food will be provided so please register by 
 responding to this email. You can park below the building and bring your p
 arking pass for validation.\n\nAbstract: Embedded controllers are being in
 corporated into electro-mechanical devices and connected to the Internet a
 t an increasing rate\, yet the developers of such equipment often have lit
 tle experience in assessing the security risks. Management and developers 
 both are quick to grasp the advantages of embedded control and connectivit
 y\, yet often underestimate the vulnerabilities that may be unintentionall
 y introduced. This talk will discuss real-world aspects of gaining the tru
 st and support of both management and developers for the use of a security
  development lifecycle and how such an approach results in better product 
 quality and lower product acquisition costs.\n\nBio: Larry Kovnat (CISSP\,
  CISM) was previously Senior Product Security Manager at Xerox Corporation
 \, and is a widely recognized expert in embedded systems security. At Xero
 x\, Larry led the effort to build security into the embedded controllers o
 f advanced hardcopy multifunction devices. Larry brought a risk assessment
  and mitigation approach to secure development and instituted a secure pro
 duct development lifecycle that distinguished Xerox as a leader in hardcop
 y device security\, with over 50 products achieving Common Criteria certif
 ication from multiple international schemes. Now an independent consultant
 \, Larry has long experience in product development and product security a
 t the senior management level. \n\nLocation: Nixon Peabody LLP - 1300 Clin
