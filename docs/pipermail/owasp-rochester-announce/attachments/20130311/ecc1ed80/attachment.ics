 itle: Ethical Hacking as a Professional Penetration Testing Technique\n\nRa
 lph will briefly discuss Ethical Hacking (EH) and Penetration Testing (PT)\
 , why they are important and how they differ. He will talk about the ethica
 l hacking mindset and the ethical hacking process and why it's important as
  a professional penetration testing meta-technique. The presentation will t
 hen apply the EH process with audience participation on exploiting sample v
 ulnerabilities of both servers and clients. The examples will cover several
  specific\, yet basic tools and techniques that continue to be effective in
  the exploitations of systems\, applications and clients. Of course he'll a
 lso briefly discuss how to defend against these attacks. Although the cool 
 tools and sexy exploits tend to get much of the attention when it comes to 
 penetration testing\, the focus will be on the ethical hacking as a meta-te
 chnique and how it can be applied to maximize the usefulness of the results
  to the hiring organization. The presentation will also cover some common m
 isconceptions\, mistakes\, ethical issues and non-professionalisms that con
 tinue to trouble the profession. \n\nBio\n\nRalph Durkee is the principal s
