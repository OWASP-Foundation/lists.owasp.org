Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] Informal Chapter Meet
Message-ID: <53AC8844.1070202@rd1.net>

I'd like to have an informal Rochester OWASP meeting next week to get
discuss plans and ideas for meeting and activities the rest of the
year.  We'll meet at a local eatery, to be announced. Our chapter will
provide appetizers.  As you may already now the chapter is partnering
with the Rochester ISSA to host an OWASP track at the Rochester Security
Summit, and I'd like to discuss the volunteer opportunities associated
with the Summit, as well as next OWASP meetings.

I'd like to discuss:

* Presentation ideas and offers for a future OWASP meeting.
* Suggestions and offers for future chapter meeting locations
* Presentation or training ideas for Rochester Security Summit
presentation and sponsorship suggestions.
* Application security topics and issues.


With short notice and to maximize participation I've created a doodle
poll for those that are interested. 

http://doodle.com/a7efp77dmryw9fdg

Please respond by end of business day Friday to the Doodle poll with the
meeting times that work for you.  There are 3 options, Yes, No and
If-need-be for those that are  do-able but not preferred time slots.  
If you'd rather respond directly via email that's fine too.

Thank You.
