ISTS6 Is long overdue. For those of you who don't know, the Information
Security Talent Search is SPARSA's yearly competition to find the best and
the brightest in the security field. You have 5 hours to design and
implement four critical services for your team (20 teams, 4 people each) as
well as secure them as best as possible. Then you go into the Systems
Administration section of the competition, where all of the other teams are
pitted against eachother at once in one of the craziest events in computer
security. You are tasked with keeping your services up while attacking other
team's services. Services are monitored live and are projected on a big
screen so others may see how people are progressing.

Admission is $50 per team for early bird signup (until Feb1)
After Feb 1 admission is $60 per team.

This year's sponsors include:
GCCIS

Good Info, thanks for posting.  A couple of us had previously talked to 
them about helping with the event a couple years back, and one year we 
started to get a team together for one of the event, but it didn't come 
together.  I will be away on the 28th teaching a course, so I'm not sure 
it would work out for me, unless the Friday night is optional.
Anyone else interested?  Should be a fun experience whatever happens.

Ralf,

I might leave to Italy that weekend, still waiting for a confirmation  
from a customer though. Sounds fun!
