   January Meeting Rescheduled

We apologize for the late notice.

Due to a sudden family matter for one of the speakers, the Rochester OWASP
chapter meeting scheduled for this coming Monday, January 18th, is being
rescheduled.

We are rescheduling the meeting so that it will replace the February
informal meeting (February 15th).

A reminder email will be sent prior to the February meeting confirming the
time and location.
