<PRE>Dear OWASP followers, after our big annual event, the Rochester Security Summit, followed by a period of low activity during the holidays, it's time to start a new year with new ideas! And we need your feedback. Help us help you! 

We prepared a quick survey that you can fill out online on SurveyMonkey: <A HREF="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MTBH3S2">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MTBH3S2</A>

If you prefer to reply by email, please answer the questions below.

It will only take 5 minutes of your time but it will help us a lot!

Looking forward to seeing you at the next OWASP meeting.

2. We currently meet every month. How often should we meet? [Examples: Monthly, Every other month, Quarterly, Other (please specify)]

4. We currently try to balance education and social networking. Is this good or should we be focus more on one or the other? [Examples: Education and social networking is a good balance, I want more presentations, I prefer social networking, Other (please specify)]
