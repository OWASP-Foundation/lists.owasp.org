I'll be there... and there's a rumor that my spouse may actually be in
tow with me.  We should be sure to extra geek-up the conversation
tonight ;-)

Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] December & January Meetings
Message-ID: <ebed042ed039f245018b803e5fc757a1@mail.gmail.com>

The December meeting is being rescheduled to January. An announcement for
the January Meeting will be sent a week before the meeting.

*When:* January 17th

*Location:* TBD

*Abstract:*
*State of OWASP and the State of Web Application Security*
A quick update on OWASP, and what is happening? And of course plans for the
2011 OWASP Global Summit. We?ll do a quick overview of OWASP AppSec DC 2010
conference, and then talk about the State of Application Security which will
include information from the conference. I?ll do an overview of current
state and trends as well as tools and techniques that are in use, and
discuss their cost effectiveness. I?d like to spend some time with some
interactive discussion on some meaty questions like:

Where are we and where should we be headed? Are we making progress? In what
areas are we as an application security industry doing better, and where is
improvement needed. How has the risks changed? Are we getting ahead of or
keeping up with the threats? Are there major changes needed or helpful to
?fix? the application security profession?

*Bio:*
