Title: SCAP - The Security Content Automation Protocol



Speaker: Robert Hayden, CISSP, GIAC, Xerox Corporation



Abstract: SCAP is a suite of specifications for organizing, expressing, and
measuring security-related information in standardized ways, as well as
related reference data such as unique identifiers for vulnerabilities.



SCAP is currently comprised of six specifications&#8212;eXtensible Configuration
Checklist Description Format (XCCDF), Open Vulnerability and Assessment
Language, Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Configuration
Enumeration (CCE), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), and Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)&#8212;and their interrelationships.



Defining security checklist questions and vulnerability checks in a standard
format has obvious benefits for InfoSec professionals and facilitates easier
integration with (or migration to) other toolsets. Although SCAP adoption is
a significant undertaking, anyone looking to create or improve upon a
security compliance framework should investigate the potential benefits that
partial or total SCAP adoption can provide.





Speaker's bio: Bob is a 30 year veteran of the IT world, having spent the
last 13 years with Xerox Corporation doing information security work.  In
addition to being a Java evangelist, Bob likes discussing politics and
pretending to be a car and motorcycle mechanic.



Bob holds a BA degree in Computer Science from State University of New York
at Potsdam.
