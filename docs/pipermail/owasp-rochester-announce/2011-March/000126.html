*Abstract:*
Pastebin is a website for collaboratively sharing code, chat logs,
configuration files or any other large text document and then hosts them
publicly. This system has been used by tens of thousands of users since
2002. However, sometimes, these text files contain extremely sensitive
information including Social Security Numbers, Addresses, Names, IP
addresses, Usernames, Passwords; everything that shouldn't be publicly
available. After 1 month of scraping, the amount of sensitive information is
paramount. Silas has examined the information that is publicly facing and
put together some statistics of the amount and how dangerous the information
is that has been leaked from this website.
