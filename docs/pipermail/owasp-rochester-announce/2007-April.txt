Hello Everyone,

We will be meeting tomorrow night at our regular time and place (details
on www.owasp.org/rochester).  Unfortunately, I don't have a description
of the presentation for you, but I can say that we have a special guest
speaker planned.  If I get more information I'll be sure to pass it
along before the meeting.  Hope to see you there.
