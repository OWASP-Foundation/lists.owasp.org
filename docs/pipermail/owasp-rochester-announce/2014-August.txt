Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] Conferences: AppSec USA and Rochester
	Security Summit
Message-ID: <53F93FD4.5050708@rd1.net>

The AppSec USA OWASP conference is September 18-19 with training Sept
16-17th.  $800.00
Owasp members receive a $50 discount, and you have an opportunity to
designate a portion of your registration to our local chapter.
I've already registered for the conference, if you're planning on going
drop me an email so we can get together.

Also the Rochester Security Summit is Oct 7-8 this year.  We'll have an
OWASP track with AppSec speakers on day 2 of the Summit, along with
hands on Ethical Hacking training on Day 1.  Registration is expected to
sell out again this year, so don't wait too long to register.

Also we  have a 20% OWASP Discount code:  Owasp21Nov

Let me know if you have any questions.
Hope to see you there!
