<PRE>We've been invited by Digital Rochester to be part of their September  
9th networking event. Get Connected! is Digital Rochester's annual  
event that gathers a select group of networking and service  
organizations from around the region in order to make connections that  
can benefit the greater Rochester community. Some are hard-core  
techies, others more social, many have a mission that could inspire  
you to get involved! Come to learn more about the organizations and to  
meet some of Rochester's most interesting professionals as we all Get  
Connected!

WHEN: Tuesday, September 9th, 5:30 &#8211; 8:00 pm

WHERE:  Village Gate, 2nd floor atrium - 274 North Goodman Street

Over twenty groups will be there to share information about their  
organizations and the ways in which people can get involved with some  
of their activities. We'll have a table, but as you mix with the  
crowd, be sure to help us spread the word about OWASP!

There'll be light refreshments from Salena&#8217;s Mexican Restaurant, free  
beer - while it lasts - courtesy of High Falls and Wright Wisner, and  
a cash bar with soda and wine!   There's no charge to attend.

For more info:  <A HREF="http://www.digitalrochester.com/details.php">http://www.digitalrochester.com/details.php</A>

Bring a friend!  Meet some new people!  We'll see you there!

Andrea

======================
REMINDER: September meeting will be on Sep 22nd and will feature a  
videoconference with Jeff Williams, Chair of OWASP Foundation.
