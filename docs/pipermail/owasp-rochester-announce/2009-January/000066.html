<PRE>January meeting has been postponed to January 26th, 6pm at Bryant &amp;  
Stratton College. We'll have a presentation about Secure Programming  
Practices by Lou Leone, VP of Technology Development for UniteU  
Technologies Inc. of Pittsford, NY


Title: Paranoid Programming Practices

&quot;It&#8217;s not a matter of whether you&#8217;re paranoid or not.
It&#8217;s a matter of whether you&#8217;re paranoid enough.&quot;
  - Unknown. (He wouldn&#8217;t give me his name&#8230;)

Abstract: This presentation provides an overview of Policy Frameworks  
and their importance to formalizing secure programming practices  
within a software development organization. It also covers the primary  
elements of Secure Programming Practices including discussions on  
attackers, tenants, architectures, and principles. This presentation  
is focused towards OWASP and Payment Card Industries&#8217; Data Security  
Specification (PCI DSS) audiences and concludes with a review of the  
&#8220;Top 10&#8221; vulnerabilities along OWASP classifications.

Presenter: Lou Leone

Lou Leone is a Cognitive Science graduate from the University of  
Rochester. He is founder of Telperion Development Corp. and has  
provided services for the utility and telecommunications industries  
and for Rochester&#8217;s ever present Kodak and Xerox. He had a brief stint  
as the VP of Technology for PaeTec Communications, Inc. and is  
presently the VP of Technology Development for UniteU Technologies  
Inc. Over years of personally writing vast swaths of absolutely  
terrible code, he has developed a fine appreciation of the art of  
software architecture and the beauty of implementation excellence.
