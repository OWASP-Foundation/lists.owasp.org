January meeting is tonight, January 26th, 6pm at Bryant &amp;
Stratton College. We'll have a presentation about Secure Programming
Practices by Lou Leone, VP of Technology Development for UniteU
Technologies Inc. of Pittsford, NY

Title: Paranoid Programming Practices

&quot;It&#146;s not a matter of whether you&#146;re paranoid or not.
It&#146;s a matter of whether you&#146;re paranoid enough.&quot;
  - Unknown. (He wouldn&#146;t give me his name
)

Abstract: This presentation provides an overview of Policy Frameworks
and their importance to formalizing secure programming practices
within a software development organization. It also covers the primary
elements of Secure Programming Practices including discussions on
attackers, tenants, architectures, and principles. This presentation
is focused towards OWASP and Payment Card Industries&#146; Data Security
Specification (PCI DSS) audiences and concludes with a review of the
&#147;Top 10&#148; vulnerabilities along OWASP classifications.

Presenter: Lou Leone

Rochester. He is founder of Telperion Development Corp. and has
provided services for the utility and telecommunications industries

as the VP of Technology for PaeTec Communications, Inc. and is
