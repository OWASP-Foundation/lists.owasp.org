Tickets for the 2018 Rochester Security Summit are available to OWASP
members at a discount. The price for members is $150; that's $100 off
the current rate. The event is expected to sell out?_soon_, and ticket
quantity is limited.

Contact me for registration details.

Don't have an active membership to OWASP? A membership is only $50 for
the year, equal to the summit discount.
