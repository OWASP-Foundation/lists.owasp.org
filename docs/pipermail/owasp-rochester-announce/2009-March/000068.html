<PRE>Next OWASP meeting will be held on March 16th, 6pm at Bryant &amp;  
Stratton College.


Title: 2008 Web Security Trends

Abstract: The presentation will open with a brief review of the OWASP  
Top Ten from 2007, followed by a review and comparison of 2007 and  
2008 web security statistics. After this we'll review some recent high  
profile web site incidents and a few of the web site flaws personally  
discovered by Duane in 2008. We'll discuss how these vulnerabilities  
are easily exploited and how they are prevented. The presentation will  
be concluded by some industry web security predictions for 2009.

Presenter: Duane Peifer

Duane is CTO at UberGuard Information Security, LLC, in Avon, NY, were  
he provides UberGuard's customers with technical consulting and web  
site security assessments and penetration tests. He holds a B.S. in  
Computer Science from Rochester Institute of Technology and has 15  
years of Systems Engineering and Project Management experience. Duane  
is also the co-owner of UberScan, LLC, a startup software development  
company.
