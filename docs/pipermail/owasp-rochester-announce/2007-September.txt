Message-ID: <46DDC73D.5020506@rd1.net>

Our next OWASP meeting is next Monday September 10th 6pm.  We are 
meeting earlier in September in order to be part of the Global OWASP 
event. <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Day>  We plan to have a 
brief video by Jeff Williams. Followed by a presentation, and some 
survey / panel questions about OWASP.  There's a new OWASP top 10 that 
has been updated and published this year. We will be going over the new 
top 10, especially some of the items that may be less familiar. We will 
be upstairs in room 204. Enter the main entrance for the college, and go 
up the stairs and to the left. We will have some signs up as well.

Please let me know if you plan to attend, so I know how much pizza to bring.

Sorry for leaving out that we will be meeting at our usual location at 
Bryant & Stratton College:

*Location:*

I'd like you all to welcome Andrea Cogliati to the Rochester OWASP

position from Mike Starks who's been pretty busy lately.  Mike, Thanks 
for your years of service to our OWASP chapter.   The Web site has 
already been updated and He was able to join us at out last meeting, so 
I'm a bit late in getting this out.   Welcome!

	Connected! Oct 2nd 5:30pm
Message-ID: <F184325C-EDDE-4712-BCD7-CD0993EF1873@dollos.it>

OWASP Rochester Chapter has been invited by Digital Rochester to be  
part of
their October 2nd networking event. Get Connected! is Digital  
Rochester's
annual event that gathers a select group of networking and service  
organizations
from around the region in order to make connections that can benefit the
greater Rochester community. Some are hard-core techies, others more  
social,
many have a mission that could inspire you to get involved! Come to  
learn more
about the organizations and to meet some of Rochester's most interesting
professionals as we all Get Connected!

WHEN: Tuesday, October 2nd, 5:30 - 8:00 pm
WHERE: Village Gate, 2nd floor atrium
        274 North Goodman Street

Eighteen (or more!) groups will be there to share information about  
their
organizations and the ways in which people can get involved with some of
their activities. We'll have a table, but as you mix with the crowd, be
sure to help us spread the word about OWASP!

There'll be light refreshments from Salena's Mexican Restaurant, free  
beer
- while it lasts - courtesy of High Falls and Wright Wisner, and a  
cash bar
with soda and wine!
There's no charge to attend.

For more info visit: http://www.digitalrochester.com/details.php

Bring a friend! Meet some new people! We'll see you there!

I appreciate Andrea stepping in to take over these responsibilities.  As
Ralf mentioned, I have been pretty busy lately and have not been able to
give the chapter the attention it deserves.  I'm sure Andrea will do a
fantastic job.  I look forward to seeing you all at some meetings.
