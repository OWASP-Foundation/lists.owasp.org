May meeting will be held on March 18th, 6pm at Bryant & Stratton  
College.

Title: Key Management - One Perspective

Abstract: Encryption is easy. Key management is hard. Really hard. The  
difficulty arises not from the complexity of keys and encryption  
schemes, approaches to them, or their applications, but from the  
impacts of encrypted data to operational systems and procedures. One  
perspective on key management provides insight into implementing  
encrypted data storage in a typical n-tiered system and identifying  
the impacted concerns with appropriate implementation strategies for  
mitigating them.

Presenter: Lou Leone

the beauty of implementation excellence.

The first sentence of my previous message should read:

"May meeting will be held on May 18th, 6pm at Bryant & Stratton  
College."

Sorry for that,

We had a great meeting last night with Lou Leone presenting on issues 
with Key Management.  Very insightful.
The presentation has been uploaded to the Rochester OWASP website  
http://owasp.org/rochester

Thanks to UberGuard <http://uberguard.com/>  for sponsoring the meeting 
and providing the Pizza and Soda.

Also Andrea, Duane and I did a recent presentation to IEEE to introduce 
the group to OWASP which I mentioned at the meeting last night.  That 
presentation has also been uploaded.

Also please check-out the OWASP membership information 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership and consider supporting OWASP 
as a member, or ask your employer to  pay for a membership.   My own 
membership is up for renewal this month. Among the other benefits OWASP 
members will receive a discount to the Rochester Security Summit this fall.

Finally if you have questions or interesting news please post it to our 
Rochester Chapter discussion list.

Also the current plan is to move the June meeting to the 22nd instead of 
the 15th.  Hopefully this date will work for more people.
