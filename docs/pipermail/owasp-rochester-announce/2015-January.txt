Team,

Now that the days are slowly starting to get longer (and hopefully
warmer), it is time to start planning this year?s Rochester Security
Summit!  We expect to deliver the same quality conference this year and
need your help.  If you are interested in participating (active
participants enjoy free admission), please complete the Doodle poll below.

Planning meetings run every 3 or 4 weeks and will be held at the
downtown offices of Nixon Peabody.  Light refreshments will be served.

Please forward this note to anyone that you think might be interested in
helping out.

Best regards,

Rich Savacool
