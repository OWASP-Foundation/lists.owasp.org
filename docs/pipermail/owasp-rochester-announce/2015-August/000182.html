*Presentation: OWASP Application Security &#8211; Building and Breaking
Applications*

Application Security continues to be the most challenging and demanding
area for securing our information. Even large organizations like Google
and Microsoft that are well funded and have a strong commitment to
security, have difficulty developing secure software. Too often, when a
vulnerability is found and a software patch is provided, the initial
patch is soon found to be lacking and is still vulnerable. The initial
patch for the recent Android StageFright vulnerability is a prime
example. So yes, writing secure software is a serious challenge, but it
can be done. Knowing how to build secure software and how to break
insecure software can be both fun and profitable. There is and will
continue to be a growing demand for developers and application
penetration testers that &#8220;get it&#8221;. We'll discuss specific examples from
the OWASP Top 10 and the OWASP secure coding principles about how things
can go very wrong, and what we can do to keep the bad guys out.

  * OWASP Top 10 -
    <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10#OWASP_Top_10_for_2013">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10#OWASP_Top_10_for_2013</A>
  * OWASP Secure Coding Principles -
    <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_Coding_Principles">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_Coding_Principles</A>

Come join your friends and bring your colleagues for a great
presentation, food, good drink, and fun conversation.
