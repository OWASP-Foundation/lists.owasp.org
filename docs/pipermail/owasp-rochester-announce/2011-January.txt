Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] 2011 Student Outreach Initiative
Message-ID: <49eda4ef227e70528ce6a42e388645f5@mail.gmail.com>

The Rochester Chapter of OWASP is committed to reaching out to all
individuals and organizations directly or indirectly involved in the Web
Application Security Ecosystem. Especially strategic to our outreach are
college students in computer science and other scientific disciplines as
they are the future developers, software architects, and managers who will
be developing the next generation of Internet infrastructures and
applications. The purpose of the Student Outreach Initiative is twofold: on
one side we want to have students involved in the OWASP community, on the
other side we want to be in touch with what our local colleges are doing in
our field so we can foster a productive and mutually beneficial
relationship.

The Student Outreach Initiative is designed to allow students to present on
a topic of their choice, as long as it's relevant to Web Application
Security, at a local OWASP meeting in front of the local webappsec community
and to compete for the best presentation award. Students who are interested
in competing may submit an abstract of their proposed presentation. The
Rochester OWASP Board will select the best abstracts and their authors will
be invited to present at a special OWASP meeting showcases student work.
Presentations will be limited to 20 minutes. At the end of the meeting, the
attendees will vote for the best presentation.

Prizes:
    *First Prize:* Honorary OWASP membership (a $50 value) plus a $100 VISA
gift card
    *Second Prize:* $50 VISA gift card
    *Third Prize:* $25 VISA gift card

Abstracts must be submitted by email to andrea.cogliati at owasp.org by
February 18th.
Final slides must be submitted by March 4th.
The finalists will be invited to present on March 21st.

Please submit any questions you may have regarding this initiative to
andrea.cogliati at owasp.org

*Abstract:*
*State of OWASP and the State of Web Application Security*
A quick update on OWASP, and what is happening? And of course plans for the
2011 OWASP Global Summit. We?ll do a quick overview of OWASP AppSec DC 2010
conference, and then talk about the State of Application Security which will
include information from the conference. I?ll do an overview of current
state and trends as well as tools and techniques that are in use, and
discuss their cost effectiveness. I?d like to spend some time with some
interactive discussion on some meaty questions like:

Where are we and where should we be headed? Are we making progress? In what
areas are we as an application security industry doing better, and where is
improvement needed. How has the risks changed? Are we getting ahead of or
keeping up with the threats? Are there major changes needed or helpful to
?fix? the application security profession?
