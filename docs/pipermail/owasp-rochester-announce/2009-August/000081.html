OWASP Announces International Application Security Conference for 2009 
Speaker Agenda Released and Registration Open for 2009's Largest Web 
Application Security Event


Washington DC August 20th, 2009 -- Following in the footsteps of the 
Open Web Application Security Project's (OWASP, <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org">http://www.owasp.org</A> ) 
immensely successful and popular conferences earlier this year in 
Australia, Poland, Ireland, and Brazil, Washington DC will be hosting 
the 2009 OWASP Application Security Conference (AppSec DC, 
<A HREF="http://www.appsecdc.org">http://www.appsecdc.org</A> ), North America's premier web application 
security conference, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on 
November 10-13th, 2009.

AppSec DC 2009 will provide a venue for hundreds of IT professionals 
interested in securing web technologies to learn, interact, network, and 
attend presentations and training given by some of the world's top 
practitioners of web application security, suitable for everyone from 
federal decision makers and management to application security engineers 
and developers.  Executives from Fortune 500 firms along with technical 
thought leaders such as security architects and lead
developers will be traveling to hear the cutting-edge ideas presented by 
Information Security's top talent. OWASP events attract a worldwide 
audience interested in &quot;what's next&quot; in the world of application 
security. The conference is expected to draw 600-700 technologists from 
Government, Financial Services, Media, Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare, 
Technology, and many other verticals.

&quot;AppSec DC is a unique opportunity for federal decision makers and key 
technologists to become familiar with OWASP and the resources it has to 
offer,&quot; said Doug Wilson, co-chair of the Washington DC OWASP Chapter 
and organizer of AppSecDC. &quot;The federal government has already
embraced the OWASP Top Ten and other OWASP guidelines. OWASP's mission 
and community align closely with the goals set forth by the US Chief 
Information Officer: transparency, engagement of staff, reduction of 
cost, and innovation in technology. OWASP can enable the government to 
attain these goals in the pursuit of securing critical technologies that 
depend on the web.&quot;

Highlights for AppSec DC 2009 include a keynote from Joe Jarzombek, 
Director for Software Assurance in the Department of Homeland Security's 
(DHS) National Cyber Security Division (NCSD), a panel discussion of US 
Federal Government Chief Information Security Officers on their 
experiences with application security, a panel of industry experts on 
implementing security in development cycles, and a wide variety of talks 
by leading personalities in the field of web
application security, including Robert &quot;RSnake&quot; Hansen, Robert Auger, 
Chris Wysopal, and others.

&quot;For AppSec DC 2009, We're really trying to reach out to developers, 
testers and quality assurance staff because they are pivotal to solving 
the root causes of application security problems,&quot; said Mark Bristow, an 
organizer of AppSec DC and a founding member of the OWASP Global 
Conferences Committee. &quot;To this end, we have a dedicated secure 
development track designed specifically for these folks to give them the 
skills they need to build secure software effectively.&quot;

AppSec DC 2009 will feature interactive, hands-on training courses led 
by some of the leaders in application security (Security Compass, Aspect 
Security, WhiteHat Security, Inguardians and others) on the 10th and 
11th of November followed by four distinct speaking tracks on the 12th 
and 13th.  Opportunities to interact with AppSec sponsors and vendors 
will also be available, as well as an OWASP-sponsored Capture the Flag 
competition and other events.
