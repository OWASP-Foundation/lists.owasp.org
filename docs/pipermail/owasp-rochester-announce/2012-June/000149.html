</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Food will be provided. Please RSVP to this note so we can get a head count for our food order. You can also attend the presentation remotely (see instructions below).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Topic: Architecting Secure Web Systems
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this session we delve into the process of architecting a secure web application from the ground up. We'll start with some basic n-tier architecture (web vs app vs DB), throw in some firewall and DMZ concepts, then talk about server hardening with client firewalls (iptables), disabling services, and other techniques. Whether you're a code monkey wondering how the rest of the world works or an infrastructure person trying to assemble the pieces securely, this presentation is for you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Speaker: Josh Sokol

In his current role, Josh manages all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability management activies for NI.
