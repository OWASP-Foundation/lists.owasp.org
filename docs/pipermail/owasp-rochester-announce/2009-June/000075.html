<PRE>I'd like to announce some changes to the Rochester OWASP leadership 
board.  In the past we have used the summer to re-examine our chapter 
goals and plans and to reorganize the chapter;  This year we're getting 
an earlier start.  I'm very pleased that Lou Leone has agreed to serve 
as our chapter communications officer and chapter evangelist. I am also 
very pleased that Duane Peifer has offered to serve as Webmaster and 
Mail List Administrator.  Andrea Cogliati is now serving as Vice 
President, Event Coordinator and as Treasurer.  I (Ralph Durkee) will 
continue as President for this coming year.   Chris Karr and Steve Buck 
have stepped down from their positions.  We thank them for their much 
appreciated service and hope they will continue to be involved with our 
chapter.   OWASP is now a key organization in charting the future of Web 
application security across the world, and our Rochester chapter will 
continue to grow as we get the word out, and developers and security 
professionals realize the criticality of the message, and the huge value 
that Rochester OWASP chapter provides to our community.

Thanks,

--
