Abstract: The presentation will open with a brief review of the OWASP  
Top Ten from 2007, followed by a review and comparison of 2007 and  
2008 web security statistics. After this we'll review some recent high  
profile web site incidents and a few of the web site flaws personally  
discovered by Duane in 2008. We'll discuss how these vulnerabilities  
are easily exploited and how they are prevented. The presentation will  
be concluded by some industry web security predictions for 2009.
