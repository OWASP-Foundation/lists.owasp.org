*How Billion Dollar Enterprises Manage Application Security at Scale*

Security Compass recently completed a research study by surveying companies
across multiple industries with the goal of discovering how large, complex
organizations address application security at scale.  The majority of
respondents surveyed were multinational organizations who reported annual
earnings greater than $1 billion USD.  Through this new research study, we
have gleamed novel insights on how large organizations manage application
security at scale.  Through this presentation, we will reveal aggregated
insights, industry trends, and best practices that illuminate how
organizations are addressing application security at scale, so that you may
apply and compare these learnings to the state of application security at
your own organization.

*Speaker: Altaz Valani*

Altaz Valani is a Research Director at Security Compass responsible for
managing the overall research vision and team.  Prior to joining Security
Compass, Altaz was a Senior Research Director in the Application
Development Practice at Info-Tech Research Group providing IT managers,
directors, and senior managers with guidance and analysis around
application development &#8211; including Agile, Cloud, Mobile, and the overall
SDLC.  His other past positions include Senior Manager at KPMG, and various
entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial positions where he worked side by side
with senior-level stakeholders at blue chip clients to drive business value
through software development.

Altaz enjoys coding, teaching, and the challenge of learning.  He received
his BEng in Computer Engineering from McMaster University, and his MBA from
the University of Western Ontario.
