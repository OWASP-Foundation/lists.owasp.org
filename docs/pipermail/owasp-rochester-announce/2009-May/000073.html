<PRE>We had a great meeting last night with Lou Leone presenting on issues 
with Key Management.  Very insightful.
The presentation has been uploaded to the Rochester OWASP website  
<A HREF="http://owasp.org/rochester">http://owasp.org/rochester</A>

Thanks to UberGuard &lt;<A HREF="http://uberguard.com/">http://uberguard.com/</A>&gt;  for sponsoring the meeting 
and providing the Pizza and Soda.

Also Andrea, Duane and I did a recent presentation to IEEE to introduce 
the group to OWASP which I mentioned at the meeting last night.  That 
presentation has also been uploaded.

Also please check-out the OWASP membership information 
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A> and consider supporting OWASP 
as a member, or ask your employer to  pay for a membership.   My own 
membership is up for renewal this month. Among the other benefits OWASP 
members will receive a discount to the Rochester Security Summit this fall.

Finally if you have questions or interesting news please post it to our 
Rochester Chapter discussion list.

Also the current plan is to move the June meeting to the 22nd instead of 
the 15th.  Hopefully this date will work for more people.
