<PRE>May meeting will be held on March 18th, 6pm at Bryant &amp; Stratton  
College.

Title: Key Management - One Perspective

Abstract: Encryption is easy. Key management is hard. Really hard. The  
difficulty arises not from the complexity of keys and encryption  
schemes, approaches to them, or their applications, but from the  
impacts of encrypted data to operational systems and procedures. One  
perspective on key management provides insight into implementing  
encrypted data storage in a typical n-tiered system and identifying  
the impacted concerns with appropriate implementation strategies for  
mitigating them.

Presenter: Lou Leone

Lou is a Cognitive Science graduate from the University of Rochester.  
He is founder of Telperion Development Corp. and has provided services  
for the utility and telecommunications industries and for Rochester&#8217;s  
ever present Kodak and Xerox. He had a brief stint as the VP of  
Technology for PaeTec Communications, Inc. and is presently the VP of  
Technology Development for UniteU Technologies Inc. Over years of  
personally writing vast swaths of absolutely terrible code, he has  
developed a fine appreciation of the art of software architecture and  
the beauty of implementation excellence.
