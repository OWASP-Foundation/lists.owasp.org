	Connected! Tonight at 5:30pm
Message-ID: <A879D4B4-3FA4-45A0-9B1B-794B4B8022DD@dollos.it>

This is a reminder about the Digital Rochester Get Connected! event.

OWASP Rochester Chapter has been invited by Digital Rochester to be  
part of their October 2nd networking event. Get Connected! is Digital  
Rochester's annual event that gathers a select group of networking  
and service organizations from around the region in order to make  
connections that can benefit the greater Rochester community. Some  
are hard-core techies, others more social, many have a mission that  
could inspire you to get involved! Come to learn more about the  
organizations and to meet some of Rochester's most interesting  
professionals as we all Get Connected!

WHEN: TONIGHT, October 2nd, 5:30 - 8:00 pm
WHERE: Village Gate, 2nd floor atrium
        274 North Goodman Street

Twenty-two groups will be there to share information about their  
organizations and the ways in which people can get involved with some  
of their activities. We'll have a table, but as you mix with the  
crowd, be sure to help us spread the word about OWASP!

There'll be light refreshments from Salena's Mexican Restaurant, free  
beer - while it lasts - courtesy of High Falls and Wright Wisner, and  
a cash bar with soda and wine!
There's no charge to attend.

Bring a friend! Meet some new people! We'll see you there!

If any of you are able to make it to this year AppSec conference, here's 
the info ...

-- Ralf Durkee

OWASP and WASC have agreed to join forces this year to put together an 
incredible AppSec 2007 Conference for the application security 
community. A huge concentration of industry leading experts will be in 
attendance presenting high quality web application security content. 
AppSec 2007 offers a unique opportunity for security professionals, 
software developers, and IT managers to get up to speed on the latest 
and greatest attack techniques, defense strategies, and industry trends 
in an atmosphere of peers. The conference format and venue is also 
perfect for networking and sharing experiences with others that are down 
in the trenches.

 

Full details on the conference are available at:

There are many new firsts to this conference that I wanted to mention:

 

1)      This is the first joint OWASP and WASC AppSec Conference

eBay has generously offered OWASP the use of their San Jose conference 
facility for this event. (Thank you eBay)

3)      A 3^rd track has been added on Day 1 that focuses exclusively on 
Web Services Security, which is an important area for OWASP to get 
involved with (and it is)

Details on this track are available at:

for the first time at an OWASP conference on Nov 13 and Nov 14.

Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] October meeting - RVSP by Oct 12th
Message-ID: <A8A7CC8B-C5AD-4D4D-991E-A12386221122@dollos.it>

Rochester OWASP Board proposes to alternate regular formal meetings  
with beer and wings meetings at McGregor?s on Jefferson Rd. The  
McGregor?s meetings are a nice diversion because, as Chris Carr  
pointed out, InfoSec is exponentially easier over beer and wings!

So, we will have a formal meeting (featuring a presentation) in odd  
numbered months and informal events (open forum with beer and wings)  
in even numbered months.

October meeting will be held on Monday October 15th at 6pm. Starting  
topic for the discussion is "Hacker Safe-like certifications: good  
value or vapor-security?", but feel free to bring your own questions,  
ideas and comments.

If you plan to attend the meeting, please email me by October 12th so  
we can reserve a table accordingly.

When: Monday October 15th at 6pm
Location: Mac Gregor's Grill & Tap Room, 300 Jefferson Rd, NY 14623

Please note that while the attendance to the meeting is free and open  
to anyone, everybody needs to pay for their own food and drinks.

Have a nice weekend,

Andrea
