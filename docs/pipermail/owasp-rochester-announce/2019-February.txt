*OWASP Rochester Chapter Meeting*
February 27, 2019
6:00pm
Nixon Peabody
1300 Clinton Square, 14th Floor

*Please RSVP to john.king at owasp.org <john.king at owasp.org> by 2/25 if you
wish to attend.*

*Food will be provided.*

*OWASP Amass Project*

Today, large organizations deal with the challenge of running their
infrastructure across many networks and namespaces due to the use of cloud
and hosting services, legacy environments and acquisitions. This can make
it difficult for an organization to maintain visibility of its
Internet-facing assets and an ability to track down systems that pose a
risk to its security posture. The OWASP Amass Project attempts to help
organizations perform network mapping of its attack surface and better
understand how its assets are distributed across the networks of trusted
partners. During this talk, contributors to the OWASP Amass Project will
discuss how to utilize the tools and demonstrate how to regain visibility
of a large network infrastructure.

*Jeff Foley, Project Leader of the OWASP Amass Project*

Jeff has spent the last eighteen years as an innovative technologist and
technical leader taking on challenges in the area of cyber warfare. He
started the Amass project after noticing the need for robust and practical
OSINT tools that aid information security professionals in mapping complex
networks.

*Anthony Rhodes, Contributor to the OWASP Amass Project*

Anthony has over five years of industry experience as a penetration tester,
red teamer, and software engineer. He has been following the OWASP Amass
Project since its inception and has recently joined as a contributor to
help enrich its functionality beyond DNS enumeration and network mapping.

*Parking*

Free parking is available underneath the building. Please bring your ticket
with you for validation.

My apologies, but we've had to cancel this Wednesday's OWASP meeting. Based
on RSVPs, very few people would have been able to attend. However, we hope
to reschedule this talk to a later date.

Best,
John
