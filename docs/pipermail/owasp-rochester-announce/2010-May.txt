The next Rochester OWASP Chapter meeting will be held on May 17th at 6pm.

Where: Mykonos/BlueTie at 220 Kenneth Dr, Rochester, NY (entrance from Lehigh Station Rd or W Henrietta Rd), near 390 and Lehigh Station Road

Topic: New Techniques in Application Intrusion Detection

Speaker: Al Huizenga, Director of Product Management, Mykonos Software, Inc.

Abstract: Current solutions for securing legacy Web applications rely on a ?lock-it-down? approach, similar to how IT security administrators use firewalls to lock down ports and servers. But applications are complicated, and it?s often impractical to create a rule set that tightly filters every app-level input. New alternative approaches to intrusion detection and response at the application layer are emerging. One key trend is to enhance the application code itself with built-in defensive logic. By instrumenting application code with incident detection triggers and dynamic responses, administrators can prevent application abuse before bad users establish an attack vector. In this presentation, we?ll discuss the merits and challenges of this approach. We?ll focus on specific examples, including the OWASP AppSensor project and the Mykonos Security Appliance.

Speaker Bio: Al Huizenga runs product strategy for Mykonos Software, a startup focused on new ways to secure Web applications from abuse. Al has 11 years experience marketing Web-based products and technologies. He is fascinated by how the same technology attributes that drive Web application adoption ? openness, transparency, and ubiquity ? also represent severe risk to the businesses that use them.

*** CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS ***

Rochester Security Summit October 20-21st, 2010 Rochester, NY http://RochesterSecurity.org

The fifth annual Rochester Security Summit is being planned for October 20-21 in Rochester, NY and is looking for top speakers. This year there will be three tracks: Business Professional, Technical Professional, and Software Professional. 

If you believe you have a significant research or technical presentation that the security community would value and enjoy hearing, we invite you to submit your presentation topic for consideration.

All three tracks will consist of presentations in 50-minute blocks, including Q&A. Presentations may be allowed to span two blocks to accommodate topic exploration to different depths if the committee sees the merit in the longer time allotment.

?      Please submit your proposal submissions before July 27, 2010.
?      We will respond to proposals by August 17th.
?      Draft copy of the slides for the papers must be submitted by September 14, 2010.
?      Final submissions are due by October 5th.

Proposals may be submitted via e-mail to <present2010 at rochestersecurity.org> or by using the on-line submission form at <http://rochestersecurity.org/presentation.html>.

Summit attendees are a mix of technical security professionals, vendors, programmers, web application developers, security testers, students, network administrators and IT executives. Preference will be given to speakers who can present innovative technical content to a broad technical audience. Of course, all presentations are expected to challenge the brightest and quickest of attendees.

The Rochester Security Summit is not a vendor fest.  There is zero tolerance for heavy commercial content in presentations. Presenters are expected to avoid any marketing that is not immediately backed up with rationale for its inclusion.

2.   Employer and/or affiliations.
3.   Brief biography, list of publications and papers.

6.   Reason why this material is innovative or significant or an important tutorial.
7.   Optionally, any samples of prepared material or outlines ready.
8.   Will you have full text available or only slides?
9.   Please list any other publications or conferences where this material has been or will be published or submitted.
10.     If you think a second 50-minute block will be required to do your topic justice, please let us know and give a rationale for the longer format.

Please include the plain text version of this information in your email as well as any file, pdf, sxw, ppt, or html attachments.

Please forward the above information to

?      <present2010 at rochestersecurity.org> or via
