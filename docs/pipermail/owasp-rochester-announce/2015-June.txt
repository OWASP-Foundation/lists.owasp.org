Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] AppSecUSA Sept 22-25
Message-ID: <55775BE5.5010600@rd1.net>

The AppSecUSA is in San Francisco this year, Sept 22-25 
http://2015.appsecusa.org/c/
I'm working on getting a discount code for the Rochester chapter.  It
would be $100 off of June/July Registrations.
I plan to be there again this year.
Send me an email if planning on going, or send an email to our chapter
discussion list.
