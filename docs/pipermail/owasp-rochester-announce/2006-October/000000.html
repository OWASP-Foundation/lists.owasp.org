October Meeting Details

Date: Monday, October 16, 2006, 6:00 PM

Presentation: The first of the OWASP top ten: unvalidated input, by 
Steve Buck.

At this meeting we will be discussing the first of the OWASP top ten 
list: unvalidated input. We will discuss the problems posed by not 
validating input on the server side. These problems include: forced 
browsing, command insertion, cross site scripting, buffer overflows, 
bypassing site security, format string attacks, SQL injection, cookie 
poisoning, and hidden field manipulation.

We will cover how to determine if you are vulnerable to one of these 
attacks, and also how to protect yourself. We will also have a demo of 
some of these exploits in action. Finally, we will have an open 
discussion with any questions about the subject matter.

Bio: Steve Buck is a consultant for Mindex Technologies. He has been 
working with various web technologies since 1996, involving everything 
from Perl and C CGIs to J2EE.

Steve has experience as a UNIX system administrator instructor with a 
specialty in system security.

Michael Starks, CISSP
