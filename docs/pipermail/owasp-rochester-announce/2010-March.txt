*****Title:* Why Software is Still Insecure: Conclusions from a Ten-Year
Study Ed Adams, Security Innovation

*****Abstract:* Software security depends to a great degree on an
organization's application security maturity (ASM). ASM can be charted on a
continuum from the "panic scramble" through the "pit of despair" to the
"security-enabled business." Kolodgy and Adams draw on 10 years of research
to distill these application security concepts into a visual model that
enables any organization to determine its maturity and chart a path of
progress toward secure application development. The session will cover
business drivers for application security, common mistakes, best practices,
case studies, controls, prioritization, planning, measurement, and use of
tools and training.

*****Speaker bio:* Ed Adams is the President and CEO of Security Innovation,
the independent authority on application security risk assessment, risk
mitigation and education. He is a seasoned software executive with
successful leadership experience in various-sized organizations that serve
the IT security and quality assurance industries. As CEO, Mr. Adams applies
his information security and business skills, as well as his pervasive
industry experience in the Application Quality space, to direct software
security experts in helping organizations understand the risks in their
software systems and developing programs to mitigate those risks. His
organization has delivered high-quality risk solutions to the most
recognizable companies in the world including Microsoft, IBM, Visa, Fedex,
ING, Sony, Symantec, State Farm and HP. Mr. Adams is the founder and
business owner of the Application Security Industry Consortium, Inc.
(AppSIC), an association of industry technologists and leaders establishing
and defining cross- industry application security guidance and metrics. He
