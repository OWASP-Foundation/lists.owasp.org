Food will be provided. Please RSVP to this note so we can get a head count for our food order. You can also attend the presentation remotely (see instructions below).
 
Date/Time: Monday, June 18th at 5:30 PM (the meeting will start with the ISSA chapter business, the presentation will start at 6:00 PM)

Topic: Architecting Secure Web Systems

In this session we delve into the process of architecting a secure web application from the ground up. We'll start with some basic n-tier architecture (web vs app vs DB), throw in some firewall and DMZ concepts, then talk about server hardening with client firewalls (iptables), disabling services, and other techniques. Whether you're a code monkey wondering how the rest of the world works or an infrastructure person trying to assemble the pieces securely, this presentation is for you.

Speaker: Josh Sokol

Josh Sokol, CISSP graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer Science in 2002. Since that time, he has worked for several large companies including AMD and BearingPoint, spent some time as a military contractor, and is currently employed as the Information Security Program Owner at National Instruments. In his current role, Josh manages all compliance, security architecture, risk management, and vulnerability management activies for NI. Josh is the President of the Austin OWASP Chapter and is very active in the local security community. He has spoken on dozens of security topics at conferences across the country.
