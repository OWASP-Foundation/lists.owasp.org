De-Anonymizing Anonymous
--------------------------
What do you see when you take the Guy Fawkes mask off?  In 2011, Imperva managed to witness an assault by hacktivist group Anonymous including the use of social media for communications and, most importantly, their attack methods.  Since Anonymous' targets are highly variable, anyone can fall victim and security professionals need to know how to prepare.
 

This talk will give a walk-through the key stages of an Anonymous campaign:

*       Recruitment and communication: We show how Anonymous leverages social networks to recruit its members and pick a target.

*       Application attack:  We detail and sequence the steps Anonymous hackers deploy to take data and bring down websites.

*       DDoS: In this final stage, we shed light on the DDoS techniques deployed to take down websites.

Finally, we recommend key mitigation steps that organizations need to take if they ever become a target.
 

Noa Bar-Yosef
-----------------
Noa is a senior security strategist at Imperva. In this role Noa researches and analyzes the trends in the threat landscape. She is a frequent contributor to different security magazines, comments on security-breaking news, and is regularly invited to speak at industry events. Currently, Noa also writes a bi-weekly column on hacker trends and techniques for SecurityWeek.  Previously, she held the position of a senior security researcher for Imperva's Application Defense Center. She holds a MSc degree (specializing in information security) from Tel-Aviv University.
