Just a quick personal note to inform you that I have been accepted into the PhD program in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Rochester where I will do research on computational music. It's a big career shift that I have been trying to pursue for quite a while. It will also take me away from INFOSEC so I am resigning from my position as President in the local OWASP chapter. I will be lurking in the mailing lists and, my school engagements permitting, I will try to attend the meetings but it looks like my spare time will be severely limited in the future. Please let me thank the board and all the OWASP members for the support I have received in these past few years.

I wish you all the best, and be safe and secure!

Andrea
