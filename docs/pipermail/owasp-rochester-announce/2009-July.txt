We will get together at McGregor's at our usual time on Aug 17th.   For 
September we have a special treat planned.  We will have a joint meeting 
with the local Linux group www.Lugor.org  on Apache Web Application

  **** CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS ****
Rochester Security Summit October 28-29th, 2009 Rochester, NY
http://RochesterSecurity.org

The fourth annual Rochester Security Summit is being planned for October 
28-29th in Rochester, NY and is looking for top speakers. This year 
there will be three tracks, Business Professional, Technical 
Professional and Secure Software Development.

In all tracks, we are looking for content that matters to IT Security 
and Software professionals today.  If you believe you have a significant 
research or technical presentation that the security community would 
value, and enjoy hearing, we invite you to submit your presentation 
topic for consideration. All three tracks will consist of presentations 
in 55 minute blocks, including Q&A. Presentations will be allowed to 
span two blocks to accommodate topic exploration to different depths if 
the committee sees the merit in the longer time allotment.  If possible. 
please make your proposal submissions before July 22nd, 2009 We will 
respond to proposals by Aug 10th. Draft copy of the slides for the 
papers must be submitted by August 31st, 2008. Final submissions are 
needed by Sept 28th.
Please review the speaker guidelines on the web site, 
<http://rochestersecurity.org/guidelines.html> before submitting a 
proposal. Proposals may be made via e-mail or using the on-line 
submission form.<http://rochestersecurity.org/presentation.html>

Summit attendees are a mix of technical security professionals, vendors, 
programmers, web application developers, security testers, students, 
network administrators and IT executives. Preference will be given to 
speakers who can present innovative technical content to a broad 
technical audience. Of course, all presentations are expected to 
challenge the brightest and quickest of attendees.

*The Rochester Security Summit is not a vendor fest. *Consequently, 
there will be little tolerance for heavy commercial content in 
presentations. Presenters are encouraged to avoid any marketing that is 
not immediately backed up with rationale for its inclusion.  Please 
forward information to present2009 at rochestersecurity.org or submit the 
information on-line http://rochestersecurity.org/presentation.html For
