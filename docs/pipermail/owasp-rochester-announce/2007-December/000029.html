<PRE>December informal meeting will be held on Monday December 17th at 6pm.

Chris Karr and Duane Peifer of &#220;berGuard Information Security  
Consulting will introduce the discussion talking about increase in  
security awareness among businesses. Then we'll go on talking about  
WebScarab, Paros and similar tools for Web Application Security. This  
is an open forum, so feel free to bring your own questions, ideas and  
comments.

OWASP recently published a book with selected projects (like OWASP  
Top 10 2007 and OWASP Testing Guide) and best contents from OWASP web  
site. A few copies of the book will be available for people to look at.

An OWASP CD with all the presentations, tools and papers from the  
Global OWASP week, held in last September, is also available. Copies  
can be burned for interested people at nominal cost.

&#220;berGuard Information Security Consulting will sponsor the meeting  
offering the appetizers.

If you plan to attend the meeting, please email me by December 14th  
so we can reserve a table accordingly.

When: Monday December 17th at 6pm
Location: Mac Gregor's Grill &amp; Tap Room, 300 Jefferson Rd, NY 14623

Please note that while the attendance to the meeting is free and open  
to anyone, everybody needs to pay for their own food (besides the  
appetizers) and drinks.

Have a nice weekend,

Andrea
</PRE>
