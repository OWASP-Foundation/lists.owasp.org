Sorry for the delays in getting this out.   Effective the first of 
January 2010, Andrea Cogliati has taken over as the Rochester chapter 
president and I will server as the chapter Vice President.
This change was made to help prevent overload for myself, and it seemed 
like a good time to allow the chapter fresh leadership.  I started the 
chapter in 2004, and I'm glad to see the chapter reach a maturity where 
we can have new leadership.  Andrea was already active in in leading our 
chapter for the last few years, so I'm very confident the transition 
will be a benefit to us all. 
Congratulations to Andrea.
