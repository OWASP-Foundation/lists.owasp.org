Hello Everyone,

OWASP Rochester is not having a March meeting, but that doesn't mean you
have to sit home sulking in web application security depression!

The Rochester chapter of ISSA will be having a free and
open-to-the-public meeting on Monday, March 19 at 5:30 PM.  James Kist,
CISSP will be presenting on Web Application Security.  James will be
discussing common problems such as SQL Injection, as well as the
not-so-common problems, such as AJAX and AJAX worms.

Full details, including the location, can be found at:

Hope to see you there.
