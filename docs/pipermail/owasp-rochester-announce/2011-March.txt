*Abstract:*
Pastebin is a website for collaboratively sharing code, chat logs,
configuration files or any other large text document and then hosts them
publicly. This system has been used by tens of thousands of users since
2002. However, sometimes, these text files contain extremely sensitive
information including Social Security Numbers, Addresses, Names, IP
addresses, Usernames, Passwords; everything that shouldn't be publicly
available. After 1 month of scraping, the amount of sensitive information is
paramount. Silas has examined the information that is publicly facing and
put together some statistics of the amount and how dangerous the information
is that has been leaked from this website.

Title: SCAP - The Security Content Automation Protocol



Speaker: Robert Hayden, CISSP, GIAC, Xerox Corporation



Abstract: SCAP is a suite of specifications for organizing, expressing, and
measuring security-related information in standardized ways, as well as
related reference data such as unique identifiers for vulnerabilities.



SCAP is currently comprised of six specifications?eXtensible Configuration
Checklist Description Format (XCCDF), Open Vulnerability and Assessment
Language, Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Configuration
Enumeration (CCE), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), and Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)?and their interrelationships.



Defining security checklist questions and vulnerability checks in a standard
format has obvious benefits for InfoSec professionals and facilitates easier
integration with (or migration to) other toolsets. Although SCAP adoption is
a significant undertaking, anyone looking to create or improve upon a
security compliance framework should investigate the potential benefits that
partial or total SCAP adoption can provide.





Speaker's bio: Bob is a 30 year veteran of the IT world, having spent the
last 13 years with Xerox Corporation doing information security work.  In
addition to being a Java evangelist, Bob likes discussing politics and
pretending to be a car and motorcycle mechanic.



Bob holds a BA degree in Computer Science from State University of New York
at Potsdam.
