*How Billion Dollar Enterprises Manage Application Security at Scale*

Security Compass recently completed a research study by surveying companies
across multiple industries with the goal of discovering how large, complex
organizations address application security at scale.  The majority of
respondents surveyed were multinational organizations who reported annual
earnings greater than $1 billion USD.  Through this new research study, we
have gleamed novel insights on how large organizations manage application
security at scale.  Through this presentation, we will reveal aggregated
insights, industry trends, and best practices that illuminate how
organizations are addressing application security at scale, so that you may
apply and compare these learnings to the state of application security at
your own organization.
