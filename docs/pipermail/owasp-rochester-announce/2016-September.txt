Did you know that TODAY (Thursday, Sept. 15) is the last day for early bird
registration for AppSecUSA? https://2016.appsecusa.org/

We also look forward to seeing you at RSS:2016 (
https://www.rochestersecurity.org/), which will include a full-day OWASP
track sponsored by the Rochester chapter.  Although the conference has sold
out, we may have a couple tickets still available for OWASP members. Please
reply if you're interested.
