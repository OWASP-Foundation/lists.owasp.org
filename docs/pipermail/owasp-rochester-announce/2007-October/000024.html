<PRE>If any of you are able to make it to this year AppSec conference, here's 
the info ...

-- Ralf Durkee

OWASP and WASC have agreed to join forces this year to put together an 
incredible AppSec 2007 Conference for the application security 
community. A huge concentration of industry leading experts will be in 
attendance presenting high quality web application security content. 
AppSec 2007 offers a unique opportunity for security professionals, 
software developers, and IT managers to get up to speed on the latest 
and greatest attack techniques, defense strategies, and industry trends 
in an atmosphere of peers. The conference format and venue is also 
perfect for networking and sharing experiences with others that are down 
in the trenches.

 

Full details on the conference are available at: 
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_&amp;_WASC_AppSec_2007_Conference">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_&amp;_WASC_AppSec_2007_Conference</A> 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_&amp;_WASC_AppSec_2007_Conference">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_&amp;_WASC_AppSec_2007_Conference</A>&gt;

 

There are many new firsts to this conference that I wanted to mention:

 

1)      This is the first joint OWASP and WASC AppSec Conference

2)      This is the first conference being hosted at a company facility. 
eBay has generously offered OWASP the use of their San Jose conference 
facility for this event. (Thank you eBay)

3)      A 3^rd track has been added on Day 1 that focuses exclusively on 
Web Services Security, which is an important area for OWASP to get 
involved with (and it is)

Details on this track are available at: 
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/7th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_San_Jose_2007/Agenda#Nov_14:_Track_3:_Web_Services_Security">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/7th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_San_Jose_2007/Agenda#Nov_14:_Track_3:_Web_Services_Security</A> 


4)      The tutorials session has been expanded to 2 full days and we 
have five 2-day tutorials this time on Nov 12-13:

a.       Building and Testing Secure Web Applications

b.      Secure Coding for Java EE

c.       Secure Coding .NET Web Applications

d.      Web Services and XML Security

e.      Leveraging OWASP Tools and Documents to Secure Your Enterprise 
(Our first OWASP specific tutorial!! -- Taught by our Chief Evangelist 
-- Dinis Cruz)

Tutorial details are available at: 
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/7th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_San_Jose_2007/Training">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/7th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_San_Jose_2007/Training</A> 


5)      A Technology Expo has been introduced. Vendors of application 
security products and managed services will be demonstrating their wares 
for the first time at an OWASP conference on Nov 13 and Nov 14.

Tech Expo info is available at: 
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/7th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_San_Jose_2007/Agenda#Tech_Expo_-_Nov_13th-14th">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/7th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_San_Jose_2007/Agenda#Tech_Expo_-_Nov_13th-14th</A>

details are here:

6)      New Social Events! -- Breach is going to again have a cocktail 
party. This time its Nov 13. OWASP has its dinner on Nov 14. The OWASP 
Band!! Is also playing on Nov 14 (Check with Dinis for details). 
Microsoft has now joined in and is having a closing cocktail party on 
Nov 15.

 

I hope to see most of you there and I please help get the word out so we 
have a great crowd and can contribute to an excellent and growing 
conference!!

 

Thanks, Dave
