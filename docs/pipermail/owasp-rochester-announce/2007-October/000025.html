<PRE>Rochester OWASP Board proposes to alternate regular formal meetings  
with beer and wings meetings at McGregor&#8217;s on Jefferson Rd. The  
McGregor&#8217;s meetings are a nice diversion because, as Chris Carr  
pointed out, InfoSec is exponentially easier over beer and wings!

So, we will have a formal meeting (featuring a presentation) in odd  
numbered months and informal events (open forum with beer and wings)  
in even numbered months.

October meeting will be held on Monday October 15th at 6pm. Starting  
topic for the discussion is &quot;Hacker Safe-like certifications: good  
value or vapor-security?&quot;, but feel free to bring your own questions,  
ideas and comments.

If you plan to attend the meeting, please email me by October 12th so  
we can reserve a table accordingly.

When: Monday October 15th at 6pm
Location: Mac Gregor's Grill &amp; Tap Room, 300 Jefferson Rd, NY 14623

Please note that while the attendance to the meeting is free and open  
to anyone, everybody needs to pay for their own food and drinks.

Have a nice weekend,

Andrea
</PRE>
