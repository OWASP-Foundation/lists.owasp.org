<PRE>This is a reminder about the Digital Rochester Get Connected! event.

OWASP Rochester Chapter has been invited by Digital Rochester to be  
part of their October 2nd networking event. Get Connected! is Digital  
Rochester's annual event that gathers a select group of networking  
and service organizations from around the region in order to make  
connections that can benefit the greater Rochester community. Some  
are hard-core techies, others more social, many have a mission that  
could inspire you to get involved! Come to learn more about the  
organizations and to meet some of Rochester's most interesting  
professionals as we all Get Connected!

WHEN: TONIGHT, October 2nd, 5:30 - 8:00 pm
WHERE: Village Gate, 2nd floor atrium
        274 North Goodman Street

Twenty-two groups will be there to share information about their  
organizations and the ways in which people can get involved with some  
of their activities. We'll have a table, but as you mix with the  
crowd, be sure to help us spread the word about OWASP!

There'll be light refreshments from Salena's Mexican Restaurant, free  
beer - while it lasts - courtesy of High Falls and Wright Wisner, and  
a cash bar with soda and wine!
There's no charge to attend.

Bring a friend! Meet some new people! We'll see you there!
