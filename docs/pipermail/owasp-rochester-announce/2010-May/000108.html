<PRE>The next Rochester OWASP Chapter meeting will be held on May 17th at 6pm.

Where: Mykonos/BlueTie at 220 Kenneth Dr, Rochester, NY (entrance from Lehigh Station Rd or W Henrietta Rd), near 390 and Lehigh Station Road

Topic: New Techniques in Application Intrusion Detection

Speaker: Al Huizenga, Director of Product Management, Mykonos Software, Inc.

Abstract: Current solutions for securing legacy Web applications rely on a &#8220;lock-it-down&#8221; approach, similar to how IT security administrators use firewalls to lock down ports and servers. But applications are complicated, and it&#8217;s often impractical to create a rule set that tightly filters every app-level input. New alternative approaches to intrusion detection and response at the application layer are emerging. One key trend is to enhance the application code itself with built-in defensive logic. By instrumenting application code with incident detection triggers and dynamic responses, administrators can prevent application abuse before bad users establish an attack vector. In this presentation, we&#8217;ll discuss the merits and challenges of this approach. We&#8217;ll focus on specific examples, including the OWASP AppSensor project and the Mykonos Security Appliance.

Speaker Bio: Al Huizenga runs product strategy for Mykonos Software, a startup focused on new ways to secure Web applications from abuse. Al has 11 years experience marketing Web-based products and technologies. He is fascinated by how the same technology attributes that drive Web application adoption &#8211; openness, transparency, and ubiquity &#8211; also represent severe risk to the businesses that use them.
