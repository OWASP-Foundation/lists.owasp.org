<PRE>David,

we don't know all the details of the case, so I can only speculate:  
most security researchers agree that security flaws must be fully  
disclosed. There's disagreement on the timing and the extent of  
disclosure: the consensus is toward &quot;responsible disclosure&quot; -- you  
alert the vendor and give them a reasonable amount of time for making  
a patch; if they don't act, you can disclose the vulnerability in  
public -- others promote &quot;full disclosure&quot; -- vulnerabilities must be  
published immediately, no matter what. Of course, there are pros and  
cons on both sides.

Most countries (including the US) prohibit unsolicited security tests  
(sometimes including reverse engineering on products you buy, like in  
the DMCA). How did this guy get this information? Was he paid to  
perform a vulnerability assessment/pentest? Was he an insider? Did he  
have an NDA with the company? Did he discovered the flaws by mistake?  
Or was he trying to hack into the application?

The final questions on payments and rewards is a very broad one and,  
to me, it has several ramifications involving the whole free software  
movement. Thanks to the free software movement we have access to  
better software, tools and documentations, that's for sure. The  
reverse side of the coin is now the misconception that everything must  
be provided &quot;free of charge&quot;.

Finally, it looks like that consumers are protected by law from  
defective products (like an unsafe car or a microwave oven that  
explodes). Unfortunately, end users don't get the same protection from  
poor security in web applications.

</I>&gt;<i> This is a tough one for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The revealing of the 'flaw' to the public (and crackers) could harm
</I>&gt;<i> people using that companies software. At the same time asking to be  
</I>&gt;<i> paid
</I>&gt;<i> for information is not a 'new' thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the issue really is not that it is wrong to be paid for the
</I>&gt;<i> information... but the release of 'dangerous' information to potential
</I>&gt;<i> bad guys. Then again the security researcher did not 'make the flaw'  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> original software company did.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would people have thought if there had been a worker who knew  
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> a flaw in an automobile that caused it to explode but chose to not  
</I>&gt;<i> tell
</I>&gt;<i> anyone?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is one of those grey areas, but 'demands' and 'threats' tend to  
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> viewed in a poor light.
