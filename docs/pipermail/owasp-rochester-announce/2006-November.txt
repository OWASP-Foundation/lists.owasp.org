Hello Everyone,

If you haven't RSVPd yet for the meeting on Monday, please do so soon.
We'll need to have an accurate headcount so as to order enough food for
everyone.  To recap, Fortify Software will be presenting on 'Automated
Source Code Analysis'.  Full details, including directions to the
meeting, can be found here: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Rochester

Yours in security,
