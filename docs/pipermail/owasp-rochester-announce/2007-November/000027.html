<PRE>Due to Thanksgiving holiday, November meeting will be held on the  
fourth Monday instead of the usual third, namely on Monday November  
26th 6pm at Bryant &amp; Stratton College.


Presenter: Steve Buck

Topic: Sanitizing Database Inputs Using Parameterized Queries

We will spend an evening discussing why database inputs need to be  
sanitized from web forms, how to create parameterized calls in Java  
accessing any RDBMS (SQL Server will be used for demonstration  
purposes). Finally we will give an example of what can happen when  
database queries are not sanitized as a live demonstration of a SQL  
injection attack.

Bio: Steve Buck is a software engineer working for Thomson West in  
Rochester, NY. He has been creating web applications professionally  
for 12 years with various software development firms around the  
country. He has worked with a large number of different application  
servers and databases and has spent a fair amount of time as a UNIX  
system administrator as well.

Steve is a graduate of the Computer Science program at SUNY Brockport.


Attendance to the meeting is free and open to anyone. Please come and  
listen as Steve talks about the second most serious vulnerability in  
Web Applications as stated in OWASP Top Ten 2007!

Take care,

Andrea
