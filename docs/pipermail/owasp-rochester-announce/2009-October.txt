Subject: [Owasp-rochester-announce] Question: Is this extortion or security
	consulting?
Message-ID: <000001ca4520$a11c58e0$e3550aa0$@rr.com>

I saw this in LinkedIn in the Question and Answer section. People are
calling this payment extortion. Is that a correct view, or is the hacker
protecting consumers from poor security provided by corporations? Unstated
in this description is whether consumer identity information, such as credit
card numbers and/or social security numbers, were at risk of disclosure.
Also unstated is whether company assets, or revenue, were at risk due to the
security flaw. Were the security risks easily preventable, such as security
risks caused by SQL Injection attacks?

 

How to recognize on the financial statements a payment to a hacker, that
stops him from posting a security flaw on the internet?

A payment of 100,000 was made to keep the flaw of the program from being
public, how would this payment be recognized on the financial statements?

It's definitely blackmailing. Like it or not, the only "currency"  
received by security researchers for discovering vulnerabilities is  
credit. I don't entirely agree with this practice, but this is how the  
industry has been working for almost 10 years.

Question: What if the security flaw involved the potential exposure of
consumer identity information such as credit card numbers, social security
numbers, passwords, security questions such as mother's maiden name, full
name and address? Does this person have a moral obligation to current and
potentially future consumers to warn them of the problem? Especially with
the prevalence of identity theft?

What if the security flaw was due to basic security flaws such as SQL
Injection, which could be easily prevented by use of parameterized queries
and/or stored procedures? Whether the responsibility accrues to company
management (get the project done, we don't care about security, and no we
don't have time to address security issues), or accrues to software
developers is debatable. But if the company does not do due diligence, do
current and potentially future shareholders need to be informed of the
risks?

Is it a moral responsibility to protect those who could be injured by such
security flaws?

Doesn't this country still protect whistle-blowers?

And lastly, shouldn't those who labor in the security field get paid for
their work? There are those who believe that they shouldn't have to pay fair
market labor rates for Information Technology expertise.

This is a tough one for me.

The revealing of the 'flaw' to the public (and crackers) could harm
people using that companies software. At the same time asking to be paid
for information is not a 'new' thing.

So the issue really is not that it is wrong to be paid for the
information... but the release of 'dangerous' information to potential
bad guys. Then again the security researcher did not 'make the flaw' the
original software company did.

What would people have thought if there had been a worker who knew about
a flaw in an automobile that caused it to explode but chose to not tell
anyone?

This is one of those grey areas, but 'demands' and 'threats' tend to be
viewed in a poor light.

David,

we don't know all the details of the case, so I can only speculate:  
most security researchers agree that security flaws must be fully  
disclosed. There's disagreement on the timing and the extent of  
disclosure: the consensus is toward "responsible disclosure" -- you  
alert the vendor and give them a reasonable amount of time for making  
a patch; if they don't act, you can disclose the vulnerability in  
public -- others promote "full disclosure" -- vulnerabilities must be  
published immediately, no matter what. Of course, there are pros and  
cons on both sides.

Most countries (including the US) prohibit unsolicited security tests  
(sometimes including reverse engineering on products you buy, like in  
the DMCA). How did this guy get this information? Was he paid to  
perform a vulnerability assessment/pentest? Was he an insider? Did he  
have an NDA with the company? Did he discovered the flaws by mistake?  
Or was he trying to hack into the application?

The final questions on payments and rewards is a very broad one and,  
to me, it has several ramifications involving the whole free software  
movement. Thanks to the free software movement we have access to  
better software, tools and documentations, that's for sure. The  
reverse side of the coin is now the misconception that everything must  
be provided "free of charge".

Finally, it looks like that consumers are protected by law from  
defective products (like an unsafe car or a microwave oven that  
explodes). Unfortunately, end users don't get the same protection from  
poor security in web applications.
