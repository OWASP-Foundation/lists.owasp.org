Hi all,

Greetings. I am a new member to the group and wished to inform about our 
organisations' security ventures. So here it goes.

We at C-DAC (formerly NCST) Bangalore,E-City, are soon going to conduct
advanced training,certification courses in the form of contact sessions
and hands on practicals

The three courses are

    * SANS Security Essentials
    * Hacker Techniques, Exploits and Incident Handling
    * System Forensics, Investigation and Response

The courses are being conducted for the first time in India,
through a Local Mentor Program(LMP) in association with
SANS Institute, USA. (http://www.sans.org)

After completing the course, the participants are allowed to
take the well known GIAC (Global Information Assurance Certification)
certifications in the respective categories.

The detailed information (program contents, registration formalities,
contact persons etc) is available at

        http://www.ncb.ernet.in/giac/

Please feel free to contact me in case any doubts/queries.
