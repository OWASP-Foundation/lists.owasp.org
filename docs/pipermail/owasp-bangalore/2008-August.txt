the venue finaliztaion.
Moreover, the meeting starts in... mmm.. 7 minutes.

Since today's meet got screwed, can we meet on Saturday/Sunday at
Barista again?

The decided Wednesday was supposed be the last-Wednesday, and it was
not at all a short notice. Since people couldn't turn up, I thought we
should at least try to meet this Saturday/Sunday as I (and am hoping
others too) will be free on the day.

This Wednesday would be tough for me. I had to adjust a couple of
things at office to make it for the last Wednesday every month.
However, if majority is Okay with it, I can try.

Team,

We had good number of discussions around the meeting space and finally, we
could not meet last week.

Yesterday, I received a call from Mr. Syed Mohamed A, who is the AGM,
Security Services for Microland and who has been a very active member of
OWASP. He has been very considerate in arranging for a meeting place for us
for the next meeting :) At least for the next 6 months we need not look
back.

We can meet on Friday evenings/Saturday or Sunday at his office:

*Microland Ltd,* 1B, RMZ Eco Space
Bellandur Outer ring Road,
Bangalore - 38

When would be the ideal time for us to meet? Will Saturday around 3 PM or 4
PM be fine with all members? We can continue to have monthly meetings and
have the mailing list active and running.

Please let me know your thoughts soon, so that we can meet on *9th August
(Saturday) at 3 PM*.

Regards,
Hari

All,

Due to increased security measures at the venue, Syed requested that all of
the attendees information should be made available to the security.

I created a google document and shared with all at
https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pUR25ofggoYRuxseYRMqdXQ&hl=en. Could
you please take a moment and fill out the document with the required
information?

Appreciate it.

Doesn't it seem a bit scary to put out personal information out on the

Easy targets for spammers and phishers -  Ouch :-)

Ok, I just did , briefly though. (Not sure everyone sees the risk I
pointed out below...bit ironical for a list like ours I think :-)
 
Its great to see increased participation from chapter members.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to join these meetings as I am not
local but I will continue to hang out here. 
 
Keep up the good work.

All,

Today, we had our planned meeting at 3 PM. Few of us (including me) were
late, but the meet went on. It was nice to see enthusiasm of around 10 of
us. The numbers were less, but definitely we will make it big over the
period of time and I am sure about this :)

Quick summary
1. We will have our next meeting on the 6/7 September at the same venue (I
will update the Wiki too)
2. We can have the meeting timing customized monthly (Once on a weekend,
once during a weekday etc)
2. We will continue to have monthly meeting.
3. Agenda of the meet can be a demo and a presentation of any security
related product/service developed by working members.
4. We will need to spread the word of OWASP to as many people as we can.
Members can forward OWASP information to various groups
(Developer/Testing/Network) and spread the word to join with us to build the
security community in the city.

Agenda for the next meet:
1. What is OWASP? - Hari
2. Demo / How to of one of the OWASP tools - Ritesh, Microland

Please mark you calenders and do make yourself available.

Syed is considerate to provide us the venue for next few months and then we
can plan going foward.

Regards,
Hari

*OWASP*

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community
dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain
applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums,
and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application
security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process,
and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application
security include improvements in all of these areas. We can be found at
www.owasp.org.

OWASP has local chapters world wide and Bangalore Chapter was formed in 2004
to bring together Software Professionals to share and discuss aspects of
Software Security.

Even though we had few unsuccessful attempts to meet and bring people
together, the momentum is slowly gaining pace and we are now working towards
building security ecosystem in the city.

*Activities of the Chapter*

   - Meet once in a month
   - Effective utilization of the mailing list
   - Other activities as members initiate


*Monthly Meeting Agenda*
During the monthly meets, we have one presentation on a choosen topic by an
initiative member and one demo of any security related tool by members /
vendors.

*Next Meet*
The next meeting is scheduled for 6/7 September (Date and time to be
finalized). During this meet, we have:

   - Overview of OWASP Presentation
   - One of the OWASP Tool Demo.

*Venue*
Microland has been considerate to give us a meeting place in their office
during the weekends. We continue to have our meetings in their office.

Please sign up for the mailing list at
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-bangalore.

Anticipating your cooperation to make this movement a huge success.

*OWASP Linkedin Group*
If you have a linkedin account, you may join the OWASP Bangalore Chapter
Group<http://www.linkedin.com/groupInvitation?groupID=160212&sharedKey=2EF4BA2412B6>.

Hari

An interesting read from the Mumbai list, wanted to share with all here.
 
A new threat has been discovered against user supplied content.
Basically you can concatenate an image and a jar together and then
upload it to a server that allows for image upload.  This type of file
is called a gifar (gif + jar), but can be a jpg or other file types and
a jar.

The server can perform fairly comprehensive data validation on the gifar
beyond simply checking the file name extension, including actually
looking at the image header, etc. and conclude that it is an image,
completely missing the jar tacked onto the end.  You can unzip the file
and see the jar, unzip will ignore the image part of the file.

A browser (IE and Firefox both) will render the image portion of the
file via an image tag, and will also execute the jar portion of the file
via the applet tag.  Note that the applet tag can be on any page, the
important thing is to be able to upload the applet (embedded in the
image) and be able to reference its location (must be predictable).

Once the applet is running, it can contact the server, so the applet can
send any arbitrary and arbitrarily complex HTTP and HTTPS requests back
to the server the applet was retrieved from.  And, the kicker is that
the applet has access to the cookies related to the server it was
retrieved from, so it can masquerade as the user.  Evil.

Have a look at the following links:

to add to the note below, nothing earth shattering from Black Hat and
Defcon 08. 
 
But here is an interesting talk about a BGP hack. (the presenters were
able to successfully demonstrate that they could change the BGP routing
at Defcon and sent everything through a box in New York, only to come
back to Vegas.  Yes, they did this live.)

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] 7th Sept. meet --Promotion & Registration
Message-ID: <d326d36e0808290917q76667e18o58892372972c28fd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I haven't been able to do my bit of promotion (in colleges), mostly
because of my extended departure from Bangalore (part of which was
spent at OWASP Conf - Delhi :) ). Apologies for that. I'll try to do
whatever I can in the time left.
On a side note, I haven't seen any promotion mails on any mailing list
so far. I guess, we need more focus on marketing than on planning. ;)

That all being said, here is what you have to specify in all your
promotion mails/talks/presentations/persuasions-- ask them to register
for the event in advance by mailing to Hari or Syed. You could also
collect the information, in case of mass registration, and pass it
yourself. The information that could be collected is *Name*,
*Organization*, *Contact Info*.

@Akash:
Do we put up a mail on IndiaInfoSec too?

@Syed:
Did I miss something?

Regards,
Bipin Upadhyay
