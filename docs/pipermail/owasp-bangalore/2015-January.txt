Hi Members,

At times, due to location or other constraints some of members miss these
opportunities. Can we volunteer/contribute for setting up some video
conference and/or recording options. This actually helps in building group
by collaborating through another mode of communication and interacting with
more minds :-) . Participation from Audience / Speakers may also be
encouraged. I am not sure about the feasibility and associated cost but
open for discussing the same or if any of the chapter lead can take this up.

Regards,
Anuvrat Gambhir

Hi!

Shruthi Kamath and I are conducting a workshop for women exclusively on the
17th. This is in association with HasGeek and the event is going to be held
at the HasGeek house. The workshop will cover basics of Web App Security
and Network Security. The participants will work along with the instructors
as a hands on session.

Registration link : https://in.explara.com/e/info-sec-workshop

This event is for women only.  It is being held as a part of an initiative
to get more women into this field.

Please help us in spreading the word. Thanks.

If next meet up dates are fixed, I can block my saturday calendar, I can

Team, I am looking for help and I thought this is the forum to reach out for more insight.

I googled and found few tools mostly commercial, Has anyone used any tool (Open source / commercial) to identify list of software on a given platform?

Is there any tool that can help detect the following in windows and Linux platforms?


a.      List of software

b.      3rd party libraries

c.      Open source

Also, Do any of the open source tools have the ability to identify vulnerabilities on the listed Open source etc.

I am working on a program to revamp our Secure SDLC and this is one of my critical focus for this year. Any info on the same, will be really helpful. Thanks to you all.

Thank you.

How about SpiceWorks http://www.spiceworks.com/ ? Does well with
Software/Hardware Inventory, Licence Management, plus supporting a myriad
of other features. SpiceWorks worth with WMI for all client interactions. I
don't know if spice works can handle 3rd party libraries as well.
SpiceWorks also detects some malicious activities happening on your subnet
such an a computer trying to communicate with a potentially malicious IP
address.

Spice works is free (but closed source)

If you have open source code, there are some commercial cloud based
offerings for Static Code Analysis. https://scan.coverity.com/ is free for
open source.

Open Source

   - SpiceWorks (agentless, easy to set up but requires a common account
   across all systems), Runs on Windows machine. With plugins you can get
   license information of most applications. Ad based but for few bucks you
   can remove the ad and put your logo. Has Helpdesk module as well, which can
   be integrated with a portal or mail-based ticketing. Downside sometimes WMI
   issues are tough to troubleshoot
   - OcsInventory (agent based, client-server architecture, has a client
   for Windows as well as Linux machines & android phones not sure about mac)
   can run on Windows or linux


Commercial:

   - Microsoft SCCM (very robust, if you are already in a Win Environment)
   - Kaspersky Endpoint Security v10 (also does a good job of asset
   inventory in the network, requires installation of Network Agent apart from
   providing end point protection)

Message-ID: <F74EBD5768396745BA22C4126E93910D03542F@AUSX10HMPS306.AMER.DELL.COM>

Team, I am looking for help and I thought this is the forum to reach out for more insight.

I googled and found few tools mostly commercial, Has anyone used any tool (Open source / commercial) to identify list of software on a given platform?

Is there any tool that can help detect the following in windows and Linux platforms?


a.      List of software

b.      3rd party libraries

c.      Open source

Also, Do any of the open source tools have the ability to identify vulnerabilities on the listed Open source etc.

I am working on a program to revamp our Secure SDLC and this is one of my critical focus for this year. Any info on the same, will be really helpful. Thanks to you all.

Thank you.
