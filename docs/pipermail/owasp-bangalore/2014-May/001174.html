OWASP STING Game
Project&lt;<A HREF="http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/9ae0b3ebce">http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/9ae0b3ebce</A>&gt;

The OWASP STING Game Project is a card game in downloadable format or if
funded, printed and distributed at OWASP events.

STING is a combative card game in the style of Magic the Gathering designed
to teach application security attack and defense. Players will
simultaneously attack other players apps while defending their own and
supporting game business objectives.

For more information, please contact the Project Leader, Tony Turner

OWASP GoatDroid&lt;<A HREF="http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/dc356840fd">http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/dc356840fd</A>&gt;

OWASP GoatDroid is a fully functional and self-contained training
environment for educating developers and testers on Android security.
GoatDroid requires minimal dependencies and is ideal for both Android
beginners as well as more advanced users. The project currently includes
two applications: FourGoats, a location-based social network, and Herd
Financial, a mobile banking application. There are also several feature
that greatly simplify usage within a training environment or for absolute
beginners who want a good introduction to working with the Android platform.

For more information, please contact the Project Leader, Jack Mannino

OWASP PHP Security Training Project

The goal of this project is to create an interactive training system,
consisting of several units, for PHP developers. Every unit is divided in
an attack and a defense part. For more information, please contact the
Project Leader, Timo Pagel. &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-bangalore">timo.pagel at owasp.org</A>&gt;

OWASP Hardened Phalcon Project

The Phalcon Framework is the world's fastest PHP Framework, however, like
most frameworks it is not 'hardened' by default. OWASP Hardened Phalcon
aims to help developers harden their Phalcon applications in-line with the
published OWASP guidelines. For more information, please contact the
Project Leader, Rhodry Korb. &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-bangalore">rhodry.korb at owasp.org</A>&gt;

project. The Project Summit will be taking place June 23-24 Anglia Ruskin
University in Cambridge, UK and is free and open to the Community. You do
not need a conference pass to attend the Project Summit.

Summit. Sign up to participate in the Project Summit by contacting Samantha

        [image: communication]  OWASP Committees 2.0

OWASP is an organization that has been built on collaboration and community
involvement. I also hope that OWASP is an organization that can support and
innovation - encouraging the community to try new things and be willing to
look frequently and assess what is working and what isn't.

We have grown to the point where an improved process needs to be
implemented where our leaders can lead and those who wish to participate
can do so easily and productively.

In 2008, the Foundation created committees. These committees were
successful in that they pushed forward some much needed guidelines and put
some structure around areas that were undefined.

Unfortunately, over time, there were built in flaws with the committee
design that created roadblocks and eventually their failure.

We would like to propose a revamped committee structure based on a solid
foundation that provides the voice and opportunities to the community. This
structure will depend on a high level of community engagement.

Wiki page outlining structure for the committees
2.0&lt;<A HREF="http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/a154140b71">http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/a154140b71</A>&gt;

Most importantly - We want your input! not just leaders, or individuals
with an owasp.org email, anyone in the community is encouraged to
participate in this poll of both the general idea of the committees 2.0 and
particular features of the new model. Participate

*Let's see who has the fastest solution this week ...*

Five pirates have obtained 100 gold coins and have to divide up the loot.
The pirates are all extremely intelligent, treacherous and selfish
(especially the captain). The captain always proposes a distribution of the
loot. All pirates vote on the proposal, and if half the crew or more go
&quot;Aye&quot;, the loot is divided as proposed, as no pirate would be willing to
take on the captain without superior force on their side. If the captain
fails to obtain support of at least half his crew (which includes himself),
he faces a mutiny, and all pirates will turn against him and make him walk
the plank. The pirates start over again with the next senior pirate as
captain.

What is the maximum number of coins the captain can keep without risking
his life?

Send your answers to our comment desk &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-bangalore">support at owasp.org</A>&gt; for a chance to
win a prize. Winners will be announced in the next connector.
