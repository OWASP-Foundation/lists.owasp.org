Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] null Bangalore Bachaav | JavaScript Security on
 Saturday 21st December 2013
Message-ID: <CAJcbuYftGftfzJdFLCKvSqo_4h8-orMWtCxOBExGbc5Bar9bXA@mail.gmail.com>

This session will cover a small part of JavaScript security, which is of
prime importance nowadays. Today, JavaScript is the only language which
runs on every machine by default, owing to the fact that it is the
scripting language of the browsers. Due to the not so awesome nature of
earlier ECMAScript versions and a very quirky implementation of the
Document Object Model (DOM) in the browser, dealing with JavaScript code
can become very tricky at times.

If you have ever wondered about the security implications which lies
beneath these quirky behaviours, this session is totally for you. Talking
about client-side browser security for a whole day would be cool, but how
about we make it more relevant to our day to day web applications?

*The session would concentrate on*

   -     Fixing browser based injection attacks like DOM XSS
   -     Sandboxing the DOM properties
   -     Implications of polluting the global namespace
   -     Thought process of bypassing an XSS filters and then fixing them


Since defending requires a very good understanding of what the attack
surface is like, we make sure that the attacking part is completely covered
as a primer, before defending something. You don?t need to be a Mutation
XSS expert to attend this. As long you know what Javascript is and have
written basic web applications, you will find this useful and interesting.

*Pre-requisites*

   -     Basic knowledge of JavaScript.
   -     Written a few basic web applications


*Bachaav Champion | @skeptic_fx* *| Nafeez Ahamed*

Nafeez Ahamed works as a security engineer solving exciting and new
problems in the security space. His areas of expertise include client-side
security and network security. Most of his time is spent, trying to find
new ways to defend things in the browser. He feels that defending anything
is much harder than attacking, especially if you know what the
sophisticated attackers are up to.

*Important information for attendees*

Bachaav sessions are free to attend but only with prior invitation.
Participants will be selected based on how they fill the registration form.
All applications are evaluated by the Bachaav Champion to select those who
the Champion thinks will get the most from the session. Only selected
applicants will be emailed further details. Even though we would like to
get everyone to attend, sometimes the topic at hand requires extensive
knowledge of the subject and this means that the Champion may not feel
confident to have an applicant in the session.

New OWASP Projects

* OWASP Security Labeling System
Project*<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/e6f1135abe/5fae4856fa/c595dbe2a3>

The purpose of this project is creating a transnational and market wise
software security labeling system. Security is invisible, so the OWASP
labeling system will help to make it visible. The system consists of
different kinds of OWASP security labels for Web applications and Software.

* OWASP Financial Information Exchange Security Project*

This project focuses on the FIX protocol with the aim of developing a java
client to be used during security assessments of custom FIX
implementations. The project will also produce best practice guidance for
FIX protocol security. More to come soon ...

* OWASP Reverse Engineering and Code Modification Prevention Project*

The purpose of this project is to educate application security experts
about the risks and appropriate mitigation techniques that organizations
should implement to prevent an adversary from reverse engineering or
modifying the developer's code within untrustworthy environments. More to
come soon ...

I am in need of authors to sign up to finish some chapters of the Code
Review Guide V 2.0. I am hoping we can get twelve articles done by the
first of the year.

Authors, if you want to write other content, please do so. We have a lot of
work already completed. We need to finish this book. Please do not sign up
for more than one article at a time. You can do more than one article, but
lets concentrate on one thing at a time.

Hello Team,
I have attended your recent meet @ Bangalore yesterday and I
congratulate you for sharing interesting things happening in
application/web security domain.

I wish I could attend upcoming Bachao Meet On javascript, but due to
some personal work , I will be out of Bangalore and would not be able
to attend it in person.
Due to this reason, I want to know if you will be sharing/steeming it
live so that I can attend it online.
Let me know the details so that i can get benifited with it.

Regards,
Swaroop Shastri

Hi Swaroop,

Due to the way hands-on workshops are conducted, we don't think it will add
any value to stream/record the sessions. We do release all the code,
presentations and related documents under an open license for anyone to
peruse.

Thank you for your query.

Implementation Sessions
To: null-co-in at googlegroups.com


Hi all,

The Bangalore chapter is planning to start a series of sessions on
Cryptography Theory and examples of implementation in various programming
languages. These sessions are largely going to be theoretical with a couple
of example demos. We would want to figure out the amount of interest this
has in the community and are requesting interested members to fill out the
following form to obtain feedback regarding the participation.

Remember, like all null sessions, these sessions will also be conducted
free of cost.

Please provide feedback/comments/register here:
