Hi all,

A blog entry of this email here
<A HREF="http://null.co.in/2009/09/07/null-bangalore-meeting-on-5th-september-2009-an-update/">http://null.co.in/2009/09/07/null-bangalore-meeting-on-5th-september-2009-an-update/</A>

We had a combined NULL + OWASP meeting this time. The response was
very encouraging with over 20 people showing up.

TALKS

We had two informative talks
1. Cookie Replay Attacks by Ravi Gopal
2. Cloud Security by Shashidhar

In the cookie replay attacks talk and demo, Ravi demonstrated how
trivial it is to sniff an ethernet network to find google cookies and
then replay them to gain access to the gmail accounts. His research
has indicated that only the GX cookie value is enough to do this. The
attack is mitigated by using secure HTTP for your entire gmail
session. His blog entry about this is
<A HREF="http://ravigopalt.blogspot.com/2009/09/gmail-account-hacking-through-gx-cookie.html">http://ravigopalt.blogspot.com/2009/09/gmail-account-hacking-through-gx-cookie.html</A>

In the the Cloud Security talk Shashidhar explained from the basics of
what is the historical background for cloud computing and took it all
the way to explain 15 domains people should be aware of before taking
their apps/businesses to the cloud. Interesting arguments were put
forth in support of and against what he presented. This also led to
Simran proposing the next meeting's topic.

One of the members was concerned that if all the sysadmin/security
related functions move to the cloud what will happen to his job.
Shashidhar assured him that there will be plenty of work going around
in the 15 domains he spoke about. Due to paucity of time he wasn't
able to cover all the points in the presentation he will surely
respond to any questions you might have after going through the
presentation.

MISC

1. We had a lucky draw to giveaway one NULL t-shirt. Gursev was the
one who won that.
2. Shashidhar suggested that in case the number of attendees becomes
more than 40 we can use the ISACA office for holding our meetings.
