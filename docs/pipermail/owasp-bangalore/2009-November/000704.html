NASSCOM-DSCI Information Security Summit
2009

Hotel
Shangri-La, Ashoka Road, New Delhi (November 23-24, 2009) 
 
Dear Sir / Madam 
Data Security
Council of India (DSCI) has developed Best Practices for
Data Protection through its programs that include the Content
Aggregation Program (CAP), Security Surveys, and collaboration with
knowledge sources and information security experts. As part of CAP,
DSCI has mapped several compliance regulations, into appropriate
security controls that need to be deployed for complying with these
requirements. This was a critical step towards defining DSCI Best
Practices for Data Protection. The compliance requirements have been
mapped with ISO 27001 international standard for security practices,
and OECD Privacy Principles for privacy requirements, among other
international standards. Mapping with these standards has helped
standardize the controls, and led to the creation of DSCI Security
Framework (DSF) and DSCI Privacy Framework (DPF), which will enable
service providers in India to be not only in compliance with regulatory
requirements of clients&#8217; countries, but also make them really secure.
The best practices meet will focus on: 
DSCI Security (DSF&#169;) and Privacy (DPF&#169;) Framework and the
DSF&#169; Technical Model 
 
	* Outsourcing Security Challenges: Outside-In
View
	* Forensics Investigation Practices for
strong Data Protection Regime
	* Emerging Disciplines of Security
	* Relevance of DSF&#169;, DPF&#169; and the
SRO Ecosystem
Security has
been established as an important function of
organizations, and is now expanding to strategic, tactical and
operational layers of the organization. Growing challenges of managing
security, increasing threats exposure of an organization and fast
expanding compliance regimes demand a comprehensive approach towards
security. On the other hand, the organizations&#8217; IT  ecosystem is
changing because of virtualization and migration to cloud computing.
These trends challenge the established notions of security, and require
an overhaul of organization&#8217;s security strategy. The complex web of
compliance regulations that are specifying increasing requirements for
data security and privacy are putting increasing pressure on the
security managers. This has created immense opportunities for security
discipline, which have seen phenomenal growth in the recent times.
Different approaches and frameworks have emerged that promises to
address specific or enterprise wide security challenges. Security
market is responding to these changes by the way of consolidation and
innovation that lead to creation of an existing security technology
market profile. The summit will take a review of all such trends
including:

	* Building a comprehensive security landscape
	* Security in changing IT ecosystem:
virtualization and cloud computing
	* Expanding compliance regime- dictating
security priorities
	* Protecting your enterprise: Challenges,
approaches and frameworks
	* Consolidation and dynamism of security
technology market trends 
You are
cordially invited to participate in the 2 days summit. You may
also depute senior representatives to attend the conference as esteemed
delegates. We would request you to confirm your participation to my
colleagues Nikhil Chachra / Anshul Yadav latest by closing hours of
