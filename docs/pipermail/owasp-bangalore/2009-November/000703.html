<PRE>   NASSCOM-DSCI Information Security Summit 2009
 Hotel Shangri-La, Ashoka Road, New Delhi (November 23-24, 2009)

  Dear Sir / Madam  Data Security Council of India (DSCI) has developed Best
Practices for Data Protection through its programs that include the Content
Aggregation Program (CAP), Security Surveys, and collaboration with
knowledge sources and information security experts. As part of CAP, DSCI has
mapped several compliance regulations, into appropriate security controls
that need to be deployed for complying with these requirements. This was a
critical step towards defining DSCI Best Practices for Data Protection. The
compliance requirements have been mapped with ISO 27001 international
standard for security practices, and OECD Privacy Principles for privacy
requirements, among other international standards. Mapping with these
standards has helped standardize the controls, and led to the creation of
DSCI Security Framework (DSF) and DSCI Privacy Framework (DPF), which will
enable service providers in India to be not only in compliance with
regulatory requirements of clients&#8217; countries, but also make them really
secure. The best practices meet will focus on:
DSCI Security (DSF&#169;) and Privacy (DPF&#169;) Framework and the DSF&#169; Technical
Model

   - Outsourcing Security Challenges: Outside-In View
   - Forensics Investigation Practices for strong Data Protection Regime
   - Emerging Disciplines of Security
   - Relevance of DSF&#169;, DPF&#169; and the SRO Ecosystem

Security has been established as an important function of organizations, and
is now expanding to strategic, tactical and operational layers of the
organization. Growing challenges of managing security, increasing threats
exposure of an organization and fast expanding compliance regimes demand a
comprehensive approach towards security. On the other hand, the
organizations&#8217; IT  ecosystem is changing because of virtualization and
migration to cloud computing. These trends challenge the established notions
of security, and require an overhaul of organization&#8217;s security strategy.
The complex web of compliance regulations that are specifying increasing
requirements for data security and privacy are putting increasing pressure
on the security managers. This has created immense opportunities for
security discipline, which have seen phenomenal growth in the recent times.
Different approaches and frameworks have emerged that promises to address
specific or enterprise wide security challenges. Security market is
responding to these changes by the way of consolidation and innovation that
lead to creation of an existing security technology market profile. The
summit will take a review of all such trends including:

   - Building a comprehensive security landscape
   - Security in changing IT ecosystem: virtualization and cloud computing
   - Expanding compliance regime- dictating security priorities
   - Protecting your enterprise: Challenges, approaches and frameworks
   - Consolidation and dynamism of security technology market trends

  You are cordially invited to participate in the 2 days summit. You may
also depute senior representatives to attend the conference as esteemed
delegates. We would request you to confirm your participation to my
colleagues Nikhil Chachra / Anshul Yadav latest by closing hours of November
