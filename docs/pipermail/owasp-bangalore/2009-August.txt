Hi,

Can we get to know the meeting details (venue & time) by Friday evening? it
becomes easy to plan accordingly if we know it in advance.

Regards,
Amit

Well Amit ,
Most of the times a meet is scheduled well ahead in advance except for the
recent few meets ,
since we had issues with Venue and went into last minute updates.
As decided we go with 1st Sunday of every month .

However all the updates are sent sent across the SMS updates that is
available for our
user group in case of any changes.

Sundar.

Vimal,

You have valid questions, but i highly recommed that you attend one of the
meets and then inquire these aspects.

We have been regularly sending updates on the meets on the mailling list
(which you are a part of) and also on the web page

Thanks Ravi & others  , who come up to take up sessions.
It is nice to see so many interested in sessions ,
& hope to see many more to come forward .
Also do let know the month you want to take sessions for.

@Ravi : when would you be available to take sessions.
Also we are in process of finalizing the venue.
@Sriram Narayanan: let know the availability of venue if we could work it
out.

Regards,
Sundar.*

Hi Sundar & other members,

I can take session in this month.

But I don't have personal laptop so somebody need to arrange it to take

Do let me know the Date, venue and time and possibilities.

Regards,
Ravi Gopal

hi sundar, et al,

i am happy to sponsor a stable regular place to meet... but can only do so
on saturday mornings ...

this morning we had the null.co.in meet in my office - the talk today was
focussed on web application security... which is right up the alley of what
owasp discusses / presentations as well.

may i recommend we meet on saturdays (null meets every second saturday,
today was one of the meetings, and i'm sure an update will send out on the
null list about it soon - it was excellent, and next time we have a live
hack session :)

That way we have a consolidated group and session...

The location of my office is in frazer town, and the exact address and
location can be found at http://www.praxeva.com/contact_us.html

If you are up for it, let me know and i'll ensure the space is available...
btw, the next null meet is on the 22nd of August, so perhaps we can have
some OWSAP presentations then too.

simran.

Hi All,

Just a few notes on the place... (a few people had trouble finding it last
time)...

* End of mosque road there is a CCD, from there, if you look diagonally
opposite (onto coles road), you will see a pizza hut (approx 100 meters).
The office is on the 3rd floor of the pizza hut building.

My number in case you have trouble finding the place is: +91 9741 39 1086

Sundar, can you please send me your contact details to keep handy...

Looking forward to the meet, cookie replay attacks is one very interesting
topic :)

simran.

Hi just an update about the combined NULL+OWASP meet up planned for
5th September 2009 starting at 10 AM ( Saturday )

There are two talks planned

1. Cookie Replay Attacks by Ravi (OWASP)
2. Cloud Security - 15 domains to think about before moving your app
to the cloud. by Shashidhar (NULL)

We plan to start dot on 10 AM as there is a lot of stuff to cover. The
venue has a projector, power points, chairs and usually we get
tea/coffee as well. In short an excellent place to have a fruitful
discussion and learn from each other.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] CFP for IEEE workshop on Collaborative Security
	Technologies
Message-ID: <b81186a60908260106l5f579921kb0ab5a464da96c82@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I would like to share with you about an upcoming IEEE workshop on
Collaborative Security technologies. http://www.cosec-workshop.info/
Please do consider submitting your research/analytical work in the form of
technical papers for the workshop.
If you are interested in participating the workshop in some way (for e.g. a
demo or otherwise) or you would like more information, please do let me
know.

thanks

Workshop on Collaborative Security Technologies (CoSec 2009)

in conjunction with the

3rd International Conference on
Internet Multimedia Systems Architecture and Application (IMSAA-09)
Bangalore, India
9 - 11 December 2009

The increasing number of Internet-scale threats is becoming a serious
concern for any organization which is connected to the Internet. With
decreasing large-scale computing and networking costs,attackers are
sufficiently equipped to carry out wide-ranged long-lived collaborative
attacks on a single target. Attackers have learned the power of
collaboration and knowledge-sharing, as proven by multiple cases wherein
similar attack code or patterns (albeit at different scales) have been used
to target individuals, small-medium businesses or large corporations alike.

The security community has always benefited from knowledge-sharing to work
together in developing sturdy solutions. Can a similar approach be applied
to define collaboration-based security technologies which can prove to be
more resistive against co-ordinated attacks? This workshop on Collaborative
Security Technologies (CoSec), aims to discuss whether an approach based on
the ?United we stand, but divided we fall? can be applied to security
technologies as well. This workshop is a first of its kind, focusing on
discussion of how a given security concept can be exponentially more useful
when used in a collaborative way across a given set of nodes, rather than
working in a stand-alone mode. Some of the technical areas wherein we
believe the collaborative nature of security technologies can be applicable
are as follows.

- Collaborative defence against DDoS attacks
- Collaborative approaches against web-based attack (phishing etc) detection
and protection
- Social networking-based collaboration for malware detection and
quarantining
- Collaborative Policies definition and enforcement across administrative
boundaries
- Collaborative responsibility for Privacy enforcement of multi-domain
information
- Collaborative forensics
- Collaboration within Govt. and Public Safety organizations against
national security concerns
- Collaborative or Distributed versions of well-known security protocols
- Multi-domain or Multi-technology-based collaboration for generating an
end-to-end views of a global or large-scale attack patterns and their
mitigation
- Augmentation methods for review of Security logs and information from
multiple sources

For more information please visit the conference web pages at
http://www.cosec-workshop.info/

The workshop welcomes papers in the standard double-column, IEEE format, but
in 10 pt font, and no longer than 6 pages (including all figures and
references).

Last Date for Paper Submission: 10th September 2009
Paper Acceptance Notification: 5th October 2009
Last Date for Camera Ready: 15th October 2009

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] BSNL Modems Exploit
Message-ID: <cf2478a20908280755l4eb54118wad195b534f2160c5@mail.gmail.com>

Just got hand of it, thought of sharing with you all.

As per my knowledge, BSNL India gives 80 % of users ZTE modems. Specifically
- ZXDSL 831 II.

here are few exploits out on wild.. watch out.

Change Admin Password & get full access to the modem

http://192.168.1.1/adminpasswd.cgi

URL Below gives access to configuration of the modem and you can get PPPOE
user & password with any Asterisk Password Revealers

http://192.168.1.1/vpivci.cgi

Is anyone aware at BSNL or informed them ? If they dont push a firmware
update (Hope they do) there are lakhs of Indian users at risk.

If you are BSNL User with this modem, watch out.

- Prakash

Dear Prakash,

This is a good discovery. I recommend you to report this to the CPE vendor,
ZTE and the service provider, BSNL. Of course, they don't have vulnerability
reporting channel with them, at least we can report it through tech support
or to senior officials in BSNL. You can also report it to CERT India, which
is now being strengthened with more power and responsibility. You need to
provide sufficient proof of exploitation for them to act.

To over come such vulnerabilities or other weak implementations (in earlier
Huawei and other modems), you can configure your computer to directly
dial-in using PPPoE (if you have a single computer) or use another router
like Linksys, Netgear or Dlink (which seem to have better and secure
implementation) and configure PPPoE dial in through the modem. This
effectively turns the BSNL router/modem into a dumb device, working just as
a modem. This method does not fix the actual vulnerabilities but reduces the
attack surface.

Unfortunately, I don't have a ZTE modem to test this vulnerability.

Below are some contact you can use:
ZTE: http://wwwen.zte.com.cn/en/contact_us/

CERT: http://cert-in.org.in/vul-reporting.htm

BSNL: http://www.bsnl.co.in/directory_officer.htm
