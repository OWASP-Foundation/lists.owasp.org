 Hi dear OWASP leaders and OWASP friends,

*please, w**e need your help! *
The new OWASP CISO Survey 2014 will be closing soon. Hundreds of CISOs
already shared their thoughts, but we need to broaden the data pool further
to later be able to derive good regional analysis of the results.


*So please help by forwarding to your chapters, sharing with your
colleagues, and forwarding to the security managers **within your
organisations and peers! *

As respected information security leaders in the industry, OWASP (Open Web
Application Security Project, www.owasp.org) would like to hear your
opinion and invite you to share this survey invitation with your security
managers and/or peers.

*Link to take the CISO Survey 2014 now:
**<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014</A>&gt;*

OWASP is preparing the Global CISO report 2014 and conducting a survey
among CISOs and senior information security managers in relation to
application security with the aim of providing you with new insights about
the state of application security across various industry sectors and about
new security trends and aligning our efforts to better help solving the
problems of the future that you face.

The survey shall take only a few minutes of your precious time and by
completing it you are helping shape the future of Internet and software
security. At the conclusion of the survey, the aggregated results will be
publicly available in the form of a free report on the owasp.org website,
keeping your information completely anonymous. (If you are interested, the
published results of the last CISO Survey Report 2013 can be found
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_CISO_Survey.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_CISO_Survey.</A>)

As you may know, OWASP is a volunteer open-source organization dedicated to
fighting the causes of software insecurity. We are also a registered
charity &amp; non-profit in the USA and the EU. See more at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP</A>

*The survey can be found here: **<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014</A>&gt;*

Or if you prefer a different language, this survey is also available in:
* Chinese: <A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014cn">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014cn</A>
* Hebrew: <A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014iw">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014iw</A>

* Japanese: <A HREF="https://jp.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014jp">https://jp.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014jp</A>

*Early participants, **before October-8 (23:59 GMT)*, can take part in a
raffle. If you provide your contact details at the end of the survey, you
will be entered into a drawing for one of the generously donated prizes.

The Survey *will finally close on Oct**ober 31st*.

Thank you very much in advance for your time and input.

Best regards,

Your OWASP Global CISO Survey &amp; Report Project team
