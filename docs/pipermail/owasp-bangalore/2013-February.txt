Hi,

Is anyone playing the CTF at http://ctf.nullcon.net ?

The web levels are really nicely designed and if you finish all the 5 I
guarantee you will learn a thing or two.

It is running till 9 PM tomorrow night, so if you have a few spare hours
this weekend go ahead.

I am playing with my name makash and currently trying to finish 5th level
of the web.

See you there.

What do you mean by OWASP in unbuntu? It would be clear if you can provide
your objectives. And also what sort of help that you are seeking?

Hi Prabhu,

If you are asking about the OWASP Live CD (URL:
http://appseclive.org/content/downloads) on Ubuntu, here's what you can do:

   - Download and install a virtual machine hosting software (VMWare or
   VirtualBox). I've used Virtual box.
      - For VirtualBox downloads on Ubuntu refer to this link:
      https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
   - Download the virtualbox image of LiveCD
   http://appseclive.org/category/tags/download-iso-vmware-image-virtualbox
   - Start Virtual box and point the source OS to image downloaded in #2.

This should start the OWASP LiveCD on Ubunut environment.

Regards,
Akshay
