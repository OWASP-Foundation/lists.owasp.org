<PRE>CALL FOR PAPERS

COMPUTE 2011: The 4th International Conference in the annual conference
series of ACM Bangalore Chapter,
<A HREF="http://www.http://compute.acmbangalore.org/">http://www.http://compute.acmbangalore.org/</A>



25-26 March, 2011
Bangalore, INdia


It is widely recognized that Information Technology and applied research in
Computer Science will play an increasingly vital role in business and
industry. This is particularly true in the area of information management
and knowledge services. There has been an explosive growth of digital
content and handheld devices and vast networks of sensors have become
ubiquitous. As a result of these developments, massive amounts of data and
information are becoming available for numerical and symbolic processing and
analysis. This information is a virtual goldmine for society, government and
industry, but the task of extracting, analyzing and storing relevant
information and making it available to the right user (or application) at
the right time poses formidable technological challenges, many of which
remain unsolved. The COMPUTE 2011 has  brings together researchers,
practitioners and technology market movers in order to advance the state of
the art and practice in computer science research as it applies to these
technological challenges and to help bridge the digital divide.
