 JOIN US FORTHE MOST COMPREHENSIVE WORKSHOP ON SECURITY IN DEVOPS

You are in the fast lane. Your products are being delivered in lightning
fast speeds, going from requirement to deployment at a rapid pace. You may
be leveraging DevOps practices like Continuous Integration, Continuous
Deployment
and Continuous Delivery, but the what stops you is a Continual, Consistent
and a Seamless Application Security process.

Security flaws come in between you and a smooth DevOps lifecycle. They
cause serious problems, in the form of *endless fix iterations, irate
customers, outages, product overruns and multiple vendor management issues* to
name a few. In addition, traditional models of application security such as
an end-of-the-chain activity like a one time Penetration Test often results
in a huge strain on the operating resources and an increase in the mean
time to deployment.

What if there was a way to integrate Security into your DevOps process?
What if *DevOps became SecDevOps?*
