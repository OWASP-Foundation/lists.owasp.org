  - Attach your source code/exploit/full paper along with the submission

Message-ID: <CAO_7Mb2PzZ3hRL6O-AGR9v8y5+Ey8SKnP7QsgDEff+EyWijKDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Please let me know if Nessus is capable of doing password policy checks.
Something like, if I have lets say I have 10 systems in my network, can I
use it to scan through the network for all 10 systems to give me results of
only password policy checks. Like, password expired, password changed / not
changed / week password configuration etc....Both including Windows and
Linux/Unix.

Please help me with Nessus configurations if you have any

Raju,
Nessus scanner will try to brute force crack the passwords of some of the
default usernames like root, guest, administrator etc This is over a
network connection.

It will not however be able to find out the password age or if it is
expired.

Hope this helps!

Best regards,
Prathap
