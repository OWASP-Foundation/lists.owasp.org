<PRE>OOB: Out of Band access. This is a form of backup access mechanism you
will find on servers inside data centers, where physical access is not
always possible for SA's. This is kinda alternate communication channel
that lets you see your box from bootup and troubleshoot if the OS
crashes and wont boot. Kind of remote terminal which is equivalent to
local console. 

In the hackers jargoan, OOB access can refer to any method of
communication that allows to bypass major security enforced doors into a
network. For example, you might have your DMZ 4 layer hardened with IPS
and firewalls, VPN's with IPSEC and God knows what. But you have a
dialup modem pool specifically for the stupid managers so that they can
log into their office machine to check mail !!! , because they find OWA
complex to use. A hacker only needs to social engineer the manager or
wardial the modem pool and WALLAH ! he is inside your network, suddenly
seems all the millions you spend on the security infra would have rather
been spent on paying higher bonus to the poor SA's.

This kind of alternate access is very deadly from security point of
view. The major culprit in this category can be the public IM usage
inside the network. The hacker makes a phony girl screen name, convinces
the clerk guy to chat with him, what do you know the next moment the
hacker has a trojan inside your network and is digging out instead of
digging in. No firewalls, no IPS, no nothing, its easier for him to
break out then break in.

I can list couple of such OOB access available to a hacker, I am still
working on the list creating papers for each one I can think of. If you
can think of something more please let me know:
1. exposed ethernet cables. The ones you see dangling down the wall or
running over the ground ( like behind banks ;-) ).
2. Improperly implemented Wireless AP's
3. Public IM and Mail usage inside private networks.
4. Social engineering: I know this is a vast field, but I am only
referring to the situations where say, you leave a mp3 player look-alike
usb memory stick, with a Trojan, on the ground, near the entrance door,
and the first employee to see it takes and happily plugs it into the
office system (Do you remember &quot;Curiosity is by far the biggest killer
of crows !!! :-D &quot;)
5. Dial-up modem pools. (often the most neglected in terms of security
hardening, not the SA guyz fault really, how many security devices or
technologies do you find in the market that are targeted for modem
pools?)
6. Data storage and computer devices that are allowed to be taken
outside the company. IPOD's, laptops, memory sticks, camera's (yes
camera's too), audio/video CD's, PDA's etc etc.
7. Like pumba would tell timon .. ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON
AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON....
