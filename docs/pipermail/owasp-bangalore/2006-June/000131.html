<PRE>Hi Nikun,
Do you have any info on vulnerabilities present in AOL?
I am referring to AOL's Basic, video and voice chat as well file and photo
transfers.
Additional due to the peer to peer nature of Skype? Could it compromise our
communication.
Regards,
Yaseen

Hi Mayank,


&gt;<i> &gt; Looking from an IDS/IPS perspective, what do you feel abuot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usefulness of a generic signature, capturing all paterns, designed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the now popular PCRE expressions? I am referring to the article
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at <A HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1768">http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1768</A>
</I>

Yah generic regular expressions have been the fore-fathers of IDS's. As
a sys admin I have found and used regular expressions for basic log
analysis and security incident detection for years. Sql injection, xss
scripting and related hacking techniques on the other hand have leaped
bounds in complexity over the years. Today the two major factors
affecting an IDS approval from management includes (but not limited to)

1. Percentage of human intervention required: which has to stay as
minimum as possible.
2. Intelligence and smartness in avoiding false positives: which has to
stay as maximum as possible.

That said: 

1. Even putting aside management approval requirements, basic regular
expressions, not fine tuned to avoid false positives, can create false
alarms in the magnitude of around &quot;18000 tip-offs on an average&quot; on a
normal day. I have known of days when it has reached figures of upto
50000+. Imagine how much man hours would go into filtering them. 
2. If you are deploying an IDS, you probably want to consider the
network and CPU resource/bandwidth allocatable to it. With such sheer
amount of false positives, you run the risk of DOS'ng your own server
and affecting your &quot;genuine-alert&quot; visibility. (Not to mention spamming
up your mail box until your managers mails start bouncing back, and he
bumps into your cabin with a shot gun ;-) )
3. The most important point. Re-visiting the &quot;genuine-alert&quot; visibility
stated above. The complexity of todays SI and XSS attacks, clubbed with
automated attacks, are giving rise to worms, SAM (spyware, adware,
malware) and botter which can spread into million computers and run
automated attacks of huge magnitude. This initiates a twister in your
office, the wide top of which lies at the VP's, P's and VIP's, and the
singular bottom point of which lies on poor you. The next moment you
know you are dragging your ass and burning your midnight fuel to wade
off these attacks.  The intruder takes this opportunity to enter your
network, complete his evil intentions and leave without a trace, because
you are too busy to see him and the log servers are already overflowing.
&quot;Diversion at its evil best&quot;.

So personally I think generic generalized regular expressions is good
enough to minimize missed alerts but brings home a lot of negative
security issues too. Its more of a trade off between effectiveness and
accountability. 

One thought though: You can write regexp's to detect SI/XSS for
obfuscation done via using hex codes, as can be seen in the article, how
would you do it for obfuscation done via UNICODE, you cant just write
regexp's due to the sheer amount of alternatives available?

I would be very careful with the Regexp's I tie into my IDS ...


&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nothing much to write as of now...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think CEH is becoming quite popular these days, right? What do you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guys feel?
</I>
No comments. But I would like to mention here, CEH can get you the base
clear if you want to learn hacking.

My 2 cents

Hi Guyz,
I am compiling a research paper for exploitable vulnerabilities with
instant messengers (not website, only IM ... client side) like yahoo,
hotmail, gmail, LCS, sametime, jabber and stuff like that. Does anybody
have some good references, urls or papers regarding them. Is anybody
working actively in this field? 

This paper is an episode from a series of papers which talk about
alternative entry points for hackers. ummm.. Something like OOB
access :-)

Thankyou,
Nikun

Do you remember FOSS.IN Rasmus gave a lecture on this. He has created

Lets see what I can find on this.

Can you elaborate what is OOB access ?

OOB: Out of Band access. This is a form of backup access mechanism you
will find on servers inside data centers, where physical access is not
always possible for SA's. This is kinda alternate communication channel
that lets you see your box from bootup and troubleshoot if the OS
crashes and wont boot. Kind of remote terminal which is equivalent to
local console. 

In the hackers jargoan, OOB access can refer to any method of
communication that allows to bypass major security enforced doors into a
network. For example, you might have your DMZ 4 layer hardened with IPS
and firewalls, VPN's with IPSEC and God knows what. But you have a
dialup modem pool specifically for the stupid managers so that they can
log into their office machine to check mail !!! , because they find OWA
complex to use. A hacker only needs to social engineer the manager or
wardial the modem pool and WALLAH ! he is inside your network, suddenly
seems all the millions you spend on the security infra would have rather
been spent on paying higher bonus to the poor SA's.

This kind of alternate access is very deadly from security point of
view. The major culprit in this category can be the public IM usage
inside the network. The hacker makes a phony girl screen name, convinces
the clerk guy to chat with him, what do you know the next moment the
hacker has a trojan inside your network and is digging out instead of
digging in. No firewalls, no IPS, no nothing, its easier for him to
break out then break in.

I can list couple of such OOB access available to a hacker, I am still
working on the list creating papers for each one I can think of. If you
can think of something more please let me know:
1. exposed ethernet cables. The ones you see dangling down the wall or
running over the ground ( like behind banks ;-) ).
2. Improperly implemented Wireless AP's
3. Public IM and Mail usage inside private networks.
4. Social engineering: I know this is a vast field, but I am only
referring to the situations where say, you leave a mp3 player look-alike
usb memory stick, with a Trojan, on the ground, near the entrance door,
and the first employee to see it takes and happily plugs it into the
office system (Do you remember &quot;Curiosity is by far the biggest killer
of crows !!! :-D &quot;)
5. Dial-up modem pools. (often the most neglected in terms of security
hardening, not the SA guyz fault really, how many security devices or
technologies do you find in the market that are targeted for modem
pools?)
6. Data storage and computer devices that are allowed to be taken
outside the company. IPOD's, laptops, memory sticks, camera's (yes
camera's too), audio/video CD's, PDA's etc etc.
7. Like pumba would tell timon .. ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON
AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON....
