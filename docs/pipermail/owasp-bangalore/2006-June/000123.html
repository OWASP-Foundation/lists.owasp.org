<PRE>Hi Akash &amp; list members,

While I am away from Bangalore updates, but very keen to particiapte in the
discussions. I just had an informal mail session with Nikun. Infact Akash,
you have just peneed down my wish to have a OWASP India. By the way, is it
not there already (Sorry I didnt google it) ? and if its not, then we
definitely can have it. as fasr as my experience goe, there ARE many many
Indians and Indian companies doing nice stuffs in Secueity especially
AppSecurity.

Still, till the time that doesnt happen, let us start sharing our
experiences and have some good discussions?

Since Akash you have mentioned about SQL injection...and also, there was an
earlier mail discussing on SQL injection, let me start with my doubt on this
topic..

Looking from an IDS/IPS perspective, what do you feel abuot usefulness of a
generic signature, capturing all paterns, designed with the now popular PCRE
expressions? I am referring to the article at
<A HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1768">http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1768</A>

</I>&gt;<i> What about the agenda. Its your meeting too. What would you like to

</I>&gt;<i> Tell everyone about any great paper / tool / trick you learned which

</I>&gt;<i> Also larger issues like is Bangalore too small a community to really

</I>&gt;<i> can and should be discussed over email.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am personally interested in learning about web application security.
</I>&gt;<i> My CEH knowledge didn't cover enough for me to be sure about it.
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically I have been learning about SQL Injection on the web and
</I>&gt;<i> found many Indian websites vulnerable.
</I>

If one visits latest CVE threats at NVD site
<A HREF="http://nvd.nist.gov/">http://nvd.nist.gov/</A>  and do advanced search for high, remote vulnerabilites
in June 2006,
you'll find many SQl Injection and XSS vulnerabilites.....this could also be
attributed due to many applictions rapidly developed and usage of those
applications in some other sites (particularly forums, discussion boards
etc)....so Akash, this seems to be a behavior of not only Indian sites but
many  others...

I am not sure how to proceed
&gt;<i> and inform the admins without looking culpable. There have been cases
</I>&gt;<i> of researchers being charged in the US. Maybe as a OWASP BLR or OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> India community we can educate and inform people about such issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The point is there can be many agendas everyone has the trick is to
&gt;<i> find out a few which we all have in common and start working towards
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>

You are correct Akash, there have been many quoted cases. I think there is a
hidden protocol which is mostly followed in Security industry where the
security researcher informs to the vendor about the vulnerability and until
its patched its not quoted publicly. Another way is to report the
vulnerability to sites like NVD where they ask one to write a mail. But I
really dont know when is this reporting done, prior to informing the vendor
or afterwards...since we are actually informing to a standard bodies.....I
will try look into the issue..as its interesting one and imp to follow
up....

Nothing much to write as of now...
I think CEH is becoming quite popular these days, right? What do you guys
feel?
regards
Mayank
