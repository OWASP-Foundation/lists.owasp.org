Its a vicious circle. People want to meet to kick start but most back
out in the end because not enough people are there to kick start. I
guess if we start using the mailing list a bit more effectively in the
sense increase the traffic here with the kind of topics we would like
to discuss. I know of two people here who would like to start
experimenting and learning about new ways of hacking and the
techniques to securing.

&gt;<i> Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)

Let the doubts, experiences etc. with OWASP tools and the top 10 list
start flowing.
What about the agenda. Its your meeting too. What would you like to
discuss in the meet.
Tell everyone about any great paper / tool / trick you learned which
can help someone else.

Also larger issues like is Bangalore too small a community to really
stand out. Maybe we should have a OWASP India. Something of the things
can and should be discussed over email.

I am personally interested in learning about web application security.
My CEH knowledge didn't cover enough for me to be sure about it.
Specifically I have been learning about SQL Injection on the web and
found many Indian websites vulnerable. I am not sure how to proceed
and inform the admins without looking culpable. There have been cases
of researchers being charged in the US. Maybe as a OWASP BLR or OWASP
India community we can educate and inform people about such issues.

The point is there can be many agendas everyone has the trick is to
find out a few which we all have in common and start working towards
them.

Sincere apologies over the long email.

regards
akash
