<PRE>Hi Mayank,


&gt;<i> &gt; Looking from an IDS/IPS perspective, what do you feel abuot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usefulness of a generic signature, capturing all paterns, designed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the now popular PCRE expressions? I am referring to the article
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at <A HREF="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1768">http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1768</A>
</I>

Yah generic regular expressions have been the fore-fathers of IDS's. As
a sys admin I have found and used regular expressions for basic log
analysis and security incident detection for years. Sql injection, xss
scripting and related hacking techniques on the other hand have leaped
bounds in complexity over the years. Today the two major factors
affecting an IDS approval from management includes (but not limited to)

1. Percentage of human intervention required: which has to stay as
minimum as possible.
2. Intelligence and smartness in avoiding false positives: which has to
stay as maximum as possible.

That said: 

1. Even putting aside management approval requirements, basic regular
expressions, not fine tuned to avoid false positives, can create false
alarms in the magnitude of around &quot;18000 tip-offs on an average&quot; on a
normal day. I have known of days when it has reached figures of upto
50000+. Imagine how much man hours would go into filtering them. 
2. If you are deploying an IDS, you probably want to consider the
network and CPU resource/bandwidth allocatable to it. With such sheer
amount of false positives, you run the risk of DOS'ng your own server
and affecting your &quot;genuine-alert&quot; visibility. (Not to mention spamming
up your mail box until your managers mails start bouncing back, and he
bumps into your cabin with a shot gun ;-) )
3. The most important point. Re-visiting the &quot;genuine-alert&quot; visibility
stated above. The complexity of todays SI and XSS attacks, clubbed with
automated attacks, are giving rise to worms, SAM (spyware, adware,
malware) and botter which can spread into million computers and run
automated attacks of huge magnitude. This initiates a twister in your
office, the wide top of which lies at the VP's, P's and VIP's, and the
singular bottom point of which lies on poor you. The next moment you
know you are dragging your ass and burning your midnight fuel to wade
off these attacks.  The intruder takes this opportunity to enter your
network, complete his evil intentions and leave without a trace, because
you are too busy to see him and the log servers are already overflowing.
&quot;Diversion at its evil best&quot;.

So personally I think generic generalized regular expressions is good
enough to minimize missed alerts but brings home a lot of negative
security issues too. Its more of a trade off between effectiveness and
accountability. 

One thought though: You can write regexp's to detect SI/XSS for
obfuscation done via using hex codes, as can be seen in the article, how
would you do it for obfuscation done via UNICODE, you cant just write
regexp's due to the sheer amount of alternatives available?

I would be very careful with the Regexp's I tie into my IDS ...


&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nothing much to write as of now...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think CEH is becoming quite popular these days, right? What do you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guys feel?
</I>
No comments. But I would like to mention here, CEH can get you the base
clear if you want to learn hacking.

My 2 cents
