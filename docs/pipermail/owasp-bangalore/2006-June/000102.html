<PRE>:<i>) Thanks Akash,guyz, you ppl are a cool bunch. BTW do we yet have a
</I>venue and timing for this saturday's meeting.

My DaVinci:
Hi all this is Nikun. I am a C|EH certified and CISSP aspirant, and a
seasoned Sys Admin &amp; Security guy. I have been working into Network and
Systems security for quite a long time now. My areas of interest are IM
threats, spwares/adwares/malware (I call it SAM), systems security
(Linux/windows) and networks security (IDS, IDDS, IPS, Firewalls and
other layer 3 devices).

But unfortunately I haven't been much good at Application security, and
this is one of the reasons for joining this group. The other reason
being, I have been looking out for a geek ;) bunch to hang out with on
my weekends.

I hope I am gonna learn something from here and be able to contribute
something back to the community.

I am also the founder of the W&amp;D community, a small group of CEH'ers,
basically an unofficial C|EH user group

I like to work in close confined circles and don't prefer going public.
Neither me nor my work.

Umm.. there's a lot I could talk about my work, but I would prefer to
stand back and wait until I am asked to. At least until I am more
familiar with the group.

Geee guys, sorry for such a long Da Vinci :-D.

-Nikun
