<PRE>Hi All,

I am new to this team and also to the space of Web App Security.
Nevertheless, I am keen in understanding this space and exploring it
further.

I second what Akash mentioned. While it's a great idea to meet, lets
initiate more value packed discussion on the mailing list itself so that
we automatically derive an appropriate agenda and a premise to conduct a
formal meeting.

Regards,
- Ranjith

Its a vicious circle. People want to meet to kick start but most back
out in the end because not enough people are there to kick start. I
guess if we start using the mailing list a bit more effectively in the
sense increase the traffic here with the kind of topics we would like to
discuss. I know of two people here who would like to start experimenting
and learning about new ways of hacking and the techniques to securing.

&gt;<i> Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)

Let the doubts, experiences etc. with OWASP tools and the top 10 list
start flowing.
What about the agenda. Its your meeting too. What would you like to
discuss in the meet.
Tell everyone about any great paper / tool / trick you learned which can
help someone else.

Also larger issues like is Bangalore too small a community to really
stand out. Maybe we should have a OWASP India. Something of the things
can and should be discussed over email.

I am personally interested in learning about web application security.
My CEH knowledge didn't cover enough for me to be sure about it.
Specifically I have been learning about SQL Injection on the web and
found many Indian websites vulnerable. I am not sure how to proceed and
inform the admins without looking culpable. There have been cases of
researchers being charged in the US. Maybe as a OWASP BLR or OWASP India
community we can educate and inform people about such issues.

The point is there can be many agendas everyone has the trick is to find
out a few which we all have in common and start working towards them.

Sincere apologies over the long email.

akash
