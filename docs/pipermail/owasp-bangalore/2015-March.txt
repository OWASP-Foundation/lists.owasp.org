Hi - Do we have any experts in the Bangalore who can talk to us about ASVS?
It could be a special OWASP event or as a talk during the combined monthly
meet (April is the earliest possible).

Regards

Hello Srihari,

There are a lot of tools available in the market. But the requirement you
are quoting are two different ones.

One I think is the tool which identifies the total number of software which
are installed on your server, may it be Linux or Windows.

The second one is finding out if there are issues with respect to the
vulnerabilities in the third party libraries which are there in your
systems or server.

I have used a couple of them for your second requirement and have found
promising results.

http://www.codenomicon.com/products/appcheck/ is one good one.

I think the website speaks it all but if you are looking for specific
information let me know either here on this forum or on my personal email
ID ...


Regards,
AMIT

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Regarding Microsoft Threat Modeling tool 2014
Message-ID: <2BFAB8A31E9BD54A8B7CC07BCD01970645D74912@chnshlmbx14>

Hi Folks,



Has anyone worked on Microsoft Threat Modeling tool 2014 version? We couldn't find any documentation on tool features . For e.g. what each type of Stencil is all about, etc. We are trying to build an application threat model . However, the tool gives out a lot of generic errors and warnings and we couldn't find any supporting documentation to help resolve those.



Sample Errors and Warnings:-



The connector is not attached to stencils in a close proximity. Error   Diagram 1       True

External interactor should communicate over trust boundary.     Warning Diagram 1       True



Attached TMTGettingStartedGuide.docx doesn't explain tool features in detail.  Any suggestions would be of great help. Thanks in advance.



Kind Regards,

Archana
