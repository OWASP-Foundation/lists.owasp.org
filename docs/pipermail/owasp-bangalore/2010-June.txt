Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Who is responsible for Application Security in
	the SDLC?
Message-ID: <001701cb01a4$e582a5c0$b087f140$@org>

As members of OWASP, this webinar might not be for you - as you already know
about the importance of security in web-applications - but what about
getting others involved? Ever wanted to get your Program Managers a little
more familiar with the principals of secure coding? How about QA or the
Architects?  And what about the Team Leads and certainly the new Developers
who you'll be working beside.

 

Why not suggest that they attend a webinar specifically tailored for them. 

 

Featured Webinar:  <http://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/20658> WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR APPLICATION SECURITY in the Software Development Lifecycle?

Sponsored by: SCIPP International

 

WHEN: Live, June 3rd, 2:00 EST, or anytime after via Webcast

 

SPEAKER: Dow Williamson, CISSP, CSSLP, Executive Director of SCIPP
International

About This 45-Minute Webinar

You will hear that application security is a "finger-pointing" blame game.
Traditional Security staff claim that it's the responsibility of the
Developers.  Developers say security is not mandated in the design specs.
And, Program Managers think security has to do with patches and virus
scanners. No one seems to know who is responsible - and typically, no one
steps up and takes responsibility. 

This webinar will explore how to change all of this through a three-tiered
approach - Awareness, Training, and Education. Depending on your role within
the SDLC, you have some responsibilities for security - but to what extent
is determined by various factors. Some may just need to be familiar with the
fundamentals of secure coding, while others may need in-depth training -
while even others may want a formalized education and possibly receive
certification of their skills and knowledge.

Hopefully this presentation will discuss the following:
 
- Responsibility for Application Security as described in SAMM vs what
this speaker may state as a different answer
- Industry analyst research that he thinks does a particularly good job
of answering this question
- How much training is enough? Are cheaper forms of training such as
couple hour webinars sufficient

Its not just rediff.com, almost all other Indian portals - in.com,
indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection,
Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless.

I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year,
and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.

I am not from Rediff. I personally dont like the disclosure to public list

Rediff had several vulnerabilities at many pages. I had informed them last
year itself. They didn't care until some senior guy from Rediff asked them
to fix them. So its old trend in Rediff. Similar is the case of Indiatimes.

Is it legal to hack websites without any authorization from the owner? If
you hack sites like rediff/indiatimes, they might take legal action against
you right? Even you inform them about vulnerabilities, will this kind of act
be legal or illegal? Could you throw your opinions.

I think ringing the only door bell is not illegal, until unless you do
something that can harm them financially. I have several times informed them
about various vulns but they took action after a very long time.

Hi Experts,

I need a small help from you.

Is RE legal for security assessments of products purchased from vendors?

There has been a bit of confusion around RE topic.

I know it is illegal to do RE to steal the idea, however this one, I
need feedback from you folks.

If you can share some authoritative resources that could confirm on
the legality/illegality, it would be great.

Yeah, but EULA is not as comprehensive as law.

For example: EULA says, Decompiling and Disassembiling of product is
prohibited.

However there have been cases where if the application/product is
reverse engineered, the decision was in favour or party who reversed
it. The following link provides more details on examples:

Agreed! How about Java Applets?

I believe they are subject to manual decompilation. Correct me if I am
wrong.
