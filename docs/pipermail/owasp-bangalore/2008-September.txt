Amit,
You just have to provide your contact info to Syed/Hari (just of
logistic purposes), and you are good to go.
Welcome to the bandwagon. :)

Interestingly I dont see any security related sessions being put for bcb7

I think it would be great if anyone would give a session on OWASP top 10

Remember,

Hi,

We have a conflict with Barcamp schedule on the same dates at IIMB Please
see this http://barcampbangalore.org/wiki/Main_Page Should we reconsider the
schedule?

However IIMB as location looks just perfect to me because Barcamp, MoMo
Monsoon etc are also organised there frequently.

Thanks,
-Sumit

   - Assistance in *bridging the gap* between developers and IS teams.
   - Ensure that code *delivered is secure* and allows IS teams
   to.concentrate on Network / Infrastructure vulnerabilities.
   - Understand how* hackers turn a vulnerability into a hack *through trace
   back and detailed explanations.

 *IS and Audits teams :*

   - Report *less vulnerabilities at the application layer* thus reducing
   costs as most vulnerabilities are reported at the development stage.
   - Better *coordination between different application groups *as the trace
   back pin points root cause of vulnerabilities.

Hi All,

Today I got a chance to attend a session on Application Security by Vincent
Liu , better known as Vinnie, managing director of Stach & Liu. He is a very
senior guy in the area of application, network and computer security and is
very well known in the world for his security stuff and his hands on with
worlds top most hackers. I got this chance free of cost due to my nature of
work and completely due to company I work for where Vinnie is a consultant.
He has come down to India only to visit my company, NDS (http://www.nds.com).
A damn good session. He also mentioned about OWASP and its top ten
guidelines.

Guys, If you all agree then I'll request him to join all of us in an
informat tea session somewhere for an hour. I am not sure whether he'll
accept the invitation and whether he'll have some time. But, nevertheless, I
can try if all of the guys are interested in meeting him. I'll meeting him
tomorrow evening again for an informat chat, thats when I can put forward
this meeting request if there are few eager people who'll turn up also.
Again, I am not sure whether he'll agree for this but i can definitely give
it a try.

what say?

Regards,
Amit Goel

Sounds good to me; the only trouble being that I'll be Pune for
PHPCamp over the weekend. :(
So apparently, my vote doesn't count.

BTW, you should have started a new thread.

I'd love to change the world,
but they won't gimme the source code.

That sounds great.
I am sure a lot of people like us
would be eager to meet people like Vinnie

Sundar.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] MoM - OWASP meet at BarCamp 7
Message-ID: <d326d36e0809172141r740d88e4g4725f16648adbeb9@mail.gmail.com>

Hola everyone,

OWASP Bangalore Chapter met at BarCamp 7 on the day following the
Teacher's Day, i.e. September 6th. :)
It was attended by Hari, me, Parshuram, Peeyush, Sharmishtha, Ankit,
Sumit, Kishore, and some names that I can't recall now. Sincere
apologies.

Hari introduced the junta to OWASP using his presentation, which he
downloaded over the (pathetically) slow net connection. Since we could
not get a room, we had to host in the open. The presentation was
accompanied/followed by a lot of questions, and I'd like to believe
that we have successfully roped in a couple of new members. ;)
The good part, however, was the participation by some enthusiastic
college students. I am pretty hopeful that we can find out ways to
spread the movement via these spirited souls. More on that during the
meeting.

We have scheduled the next meeting on *October 5th (Sunday) at 9:00 AM*.

Regards,
Bipin Upadhyay.

I'd love to change the world,
but they won't gimme the source code.

Sounds good to me; the only trouble being that I'll be Pune for
PHPCamp over the weekend. :(
So apparently, my vote doesn't count.

BTW, you should have started a new thread.

Hi Guys,

Sorry for not organizing this meeting. I did not get any replies earlier. So
I thought that it might not be feasible for everyone to make it. Also, Today
is the last day of his visit to India. So, i don't think he'll be having any
more time.

but if you guys wish, I can definitely talk in a nutshell about what he
discussed with us during the sessions.

Regards,
Amit

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] OWASP Bangalore Chapter - Can we have the
	meet on 12th Oct?
Message-ID: <216934.4933.qm@web8906.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

One request. Actually, due to 2 holidays in first week in our company, I planned extended holiday and will not be in Bangalore. If we can shift the meet to next weekend(12th Oct), that would be a nice.

But if current plan is fine with everyone else, then no issue. I will surely join the next meet.

Regards,
Vikas

I remember there was a discussion of moving the meet day to next week to
have more people attend. Is the group fine to have the meeting this Sunday?
Alternatively, if the majority wants it next week, we can move it too.

This is a little troublesome (as Shikamaru would rant in Naruto -a
Japanese Anime) ;)

I am not sure if shifting the date would really have any big effect;
considering that 9th is again a holiday. However let's see. If there
are not many people opposing the idea to shift the date, we'll be
having it on 12th Oct. 9 AM.

I have just one concern, let's keep it uniform -either the first
Sunday every month, or the second.

I vote for this sunday itself :-) next week will be puja (dassehra) time and
then some (not me) might be unable to attend because of that. Lets see how
many appear this sunday.

Hari,

A request to you, what is the concrete agenda for the meeting? Being my
first meeting, i would be looking forward to discussions on
1. What are the running projects?
2. How one can contribute?
3. What is the international community working on currently?
4. Walk through and demo of active tools available with owasp community.

Bipin,
Naruto would have exclaimed - "datte baayo" :-p

-Sumit
