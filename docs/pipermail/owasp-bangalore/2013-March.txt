Hi Akash,

Thank you for your valuable reply.

After executing the webgoat.sh the output of " echo $JAVA_HOME " is a empty
line without the path.

Most likely your java bin path is not set up properly.

Can you try the following commands

$ which java
Based on the output of the above command
$export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java

And then run webgoat

I need a list of payloads that can be used during a manual web pen test. For example I looking for use cases like ?OR 1=1? that we type in to check for SQL injections vulnerabilities. I need the whole list of usages like this for various vulnerabilities. Any help is highly appreciated.

If you are just looking for payloads and attack vectors then I'm guessing
you are fuzzing.

Here's OWASP list for fuzz testing:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_Appendix_C:_Fuzz_Vectors

For SQL injection:
http://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/sql-injection-authentication-bypass-cheat-sheet/

There are some cheatsheets on: *ha*.*ckers*.org

Do a web search with <attack name> cheatsheet...you will find many :)

Cheers!
Sharath

If you are just looking for payloads and attack vectors then I'm guessing you are fuzzing.

Here's OWASP list for fuzz testing: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_Appendix_C:_Fuzz_Vectors

For SQL injection: http://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/sql-injection-authentication-bypass-cheat-sheet/

There are some cheatsheets on: ha.ckers.org

Do a web search with <attack name> cheatsheet...you will find many :)

Cheers!
Sharath
