Sadly this seems to be the case. BTW Mayank has left Bangalore so that
is one interested member less.

My suggestion is that whosoever is interested for the time being lets
keep in touch using this mailing list. See if we can build some
momentum here.

My personal interest is in web application security and currently
trying to gain more knowledge about this. Maybe we can start
discussing various aspects of this.  For reference we can take up the
OWASP web application security guide and start from there.

http://www.owasp.org/documentation/guide/guide_downloads.html

Hope we can kickstart this.

akash

wow, i didnt expected that somebody will reply so fast.
you r right. we hav to keep this group alive. even iam also intrested in web
aplication security coz iam working with web applications for the past 4
years.

ookay i hav a doubt. hope this may start a thread.
whatz my doubt is regarding the very old sql injection and cross scripting.
currently iam in a .net project. As we all know .net by default take cares
of the malicious characters from the user inputs. But i still feels like
this handling is not enough.
*so what i want to know is is this handling is 100% perfect ?? *

Dear Friends,

My name is Gaurav and i am new to this group. I want to know more web 
application security and work on finding vulnerabilities in web 
applications. Unfortunately most of the tools that are really good are 
priced very heavily. I am looking for the best open source tool for web 
application and vulnerability assessment. Please advice.

Thanks,

Sadly we just don't have enough people or in leiu of that any focus to
have regular meetings. Lets see if we can gather atleast 5 people we
can have a some BoF session somewhere.

Please respond with your views on this.

I wonder where Harinath is.

Hi Hari,

We met during our one and only meet of OWASP  BLR.
Since you have the admin rights of the mailing list can you make
slight changes to it.
Right now if I hit reply to any message from the mailing list, by
default, it goes to the person sending it rather than to the mailing
list.
It will be really convenient if you can make this change.

Valid Point

Then how about this Saturday 13th May 2006 ?
We can meet at Barista at Koramangala next to the William Penn store.
This was the venue for the last meet held on 25th March.

What do you say ?

Also whenever you reply to any mail from the mailing list add the
OWASP-BLR address to the CC list as its not happening right now.
I have mailed Hari about this, hopefully he will respond.

Hello Akash,

The necessary change has been made. 

Also, as Deepson mentioned, I think we should be planning for our second
meeting. Previously it was suggested that we meet on the third Saturday of
every month. Does that sill hold good? 

Could we meet this month's 3rd Saturday?

Well there is another thread in the mailing list about meeting this
Saturday itself (May 13th ). How about that ?

Hi All,
May be meeting every 3rd Saturday would be a better idea since most of us would be tied up in the work and may be working on Saturdae's and Sundae's and so meeting every third Saturdae and making it planned before hand(like the Meeting Place,Agenda etc) would be a better idea...
 
What do others say about this?
 
With Regards,
Himanshu.

Subject: [OWASP-BLR]Queries regarding NIKTO and Nessus
Message-ID: <BAY107-F18DCD93B93267815EA9F27E3930@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I have few questions regarding NIKTO and Nessus.

NIKTO
---------
I want to use NIKTO from a windows XP machine to explore vulnerabilities in 
my IIS 5.0 Server running on another windows XP machine. I have downloaded 
the latest vesion from the CIRT website but i have not been able to install 
it on windows. Any idea how can i install it on windows?

NESSUS
-----------
When i use Nessus to scan my system, it gives me a list of the open ports on 
my server system. I want to check if my program running as a service is 
having any buffer overflow or not. Does anybody have an idea from where can 
i get the plugin for buffer overflow.


Thanks,
Gaurav Gupta

What is the error you are getting in installing?

any nessus plugin is basically a check for  a vulnerable
software/version. That is why nessus is called a vuln assessment
tool/scanner.

If you want to exploit a vuln after detecting it you need an exploit framework.
For example Metasploit, securityforest, canvas etc.

Dd you verify whether you have correctly installed perl module
libwhisker.pmNikto requires this module to generate attacks.

As rightly mentioned by Akash, for working on buffer overflow, and if your
requirements is for a framework kind of environment, you may use metasploit.
Here you get option to select exploit and then select various payloads for
the exploits.

Specifically if you woud like to target a particular application, then you
may need to search the vulnerability (CVE id) which might have affected this
application, and then search for an exploit/proof of concept payload which
will carry out BOA.

Enjoy Buffing... :-)

Deepson,

I should apologize for keeping mum...I am terribly sorry about this. 

Anyway, I think all of us have to wake up and keep the momentum going. 

Please speak out members!!!
