Alexander Soritov, Jacob Appelbaum etc. have found a way to create
rogue CA and sign SSL certs exploiting weaknesses in MD5 algorithm.

More information is here http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/

We can have a discussion about this or maybe someone can explain the
technical aspects to the group.

Any volunteers? :-)

Hi Guys,

It was a wonderful discussion on BoF we had today.

I just wanted to share few links to gives more insight on the BoF

Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit<http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html>:
URL: http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html

This is one good article which details about 'smashing the stack' process
with examples and other illustrations. Try this if you are keen in
understanding it thoroughly.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) <http://cve.mitre.org>
URL: http://cve.mitre.org

Vikas had mentioned about the CVE database, just thought of sharing the link

CVE(R) International in scope and free for public use, CVE is a dictionary of
> publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures.
> CVE's common identifiers enable data exchange between security products and
> provide a baseline index point for evaluating coverage of tools and
> services.
>

OllyDbg <http://www.ollydbg.de/>
URL: http://www.ollydbg.de/

This is one tool which can be used to perform run time overflows and
assembly level manipulations which I had mentioned. This tool can be
downloaded for free. *Note: Dont mess your executables with Ollydbg unless
you know what you are doing.* Next session we will have demo with this tool.

OllyDbg is a 32-bit assembler level analysing debugger for Microsoft(R)
> Windows(R). Emphasis on binary code analysis makes it particularly useful in
> cases where source is unavailable

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] A very informative video about "History of
	Hacking"
Message-ID: <546659.30421.qm@web95414.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hi Everyone,

This video covers three generations of Hacking.

John Draper(Captain Crunch) -> Steve Wozniak -> Kevin Mitnick

"Hackers started out as champions of technological advancement, a group of idealistic young men who believed in the creative pursuit of knowledge and the principle that information should be free. They are now public enemy number one. So what went wrong?"

Sundar,

It was finalized in the last meeting itself; right? Rajiv will give a demo
on debugging and potentially exploit using OllyDbg and i will have a similar
demo using gdb on Ubuntu.

Thanks,
