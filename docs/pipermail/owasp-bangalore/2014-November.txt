if they can introduce themselves to the list.

If you are not sure how to cover it, please feel free to use the following
format

1. Start with your Name
2. Tell us about where you work/study
3. What prompted your interest in OWASP and application security?
4. How did you get to hear about the mailing list?
5. What would you like to learn with us or even better teach us?
6. Anything else you would like to share with us.

Thank you so much for contributing to the community. :)

Message-ID: <BLU180-W9AC263B5E0FA646EFD9B1C0890@phx.gbl>

I am Sherin and I am working now in SLK software service under IDM (identity management) which is a part of information security that is taken care of all the authentication and authorization related things. I am a CEH guy, I got interest in infosec from my second year of btech onwards. We had workshop on Ethical Hacking by "Art of hacking team" which is lead by Benild Joseph. He was the one who guided me to this OWASP meet and organization. From the last OWASP meet, I came to know about the mailing list from where we can get all the updates and all. 

I want to become a pentester and I think this is one of the best platform that i can learn and make contacts and connections. I have met lots of awesome people or awesome hackers in the last meet. It is my honor to be a part of this bangalore chapter and this mailing list. I want to know all the things that will make me a good pentester. Thank you guyz for all the support.

Hi Sherin - There is a meet this weekend. This is a combined meet of 3
different security groups (OWASP, Garage 4 Hackers and null). I'd encourage
you to attend it. It even features a talk from an OWASP member. The below
link gives you more information. Feel free to register for the event
(although, not mandatory).

Hi All - I am Sandesh Anand. I work as a software security consultant with
Cigital. I have known about OWASP for a long time, but only recently joined
the mailing list. I also help organize security related events in
Bangalore.

I look forward to participating in more OWASP events :)

Sandesh

Hi,

I am Shubham Mittal, working as Information Security Engineer with
Makemytrip, based out of gurgaon. And at times, I  try my luck with Bug
Bounty programs. :D

I was known to OWASP because of the number of good projects running under
it and specifically Owasp testing guide (learned most of the concepts from
this), but never thought of joining mailing list, Joined this after Akash
mentioned about it in one of the meets.

I am quite keen to learn new test-cases and techniques in Web App Sec
domain meanwhile being open for any discussion in my areas of interests,
but not limited to, Web App Sec, Network Forensics and Infra Security.

Anyone on the mailing list should feel free to reach me out for any sort of
assistance in these domains (and I would like to come up with my best
effort).

Looking forward to participate in more OWASP events (in any possible ways
for me).

Cheers.

Message-ID: <CADKSn5pRDaMMtSCC_GqTyjbiTD1dkX6h-OvKEc88wObgMC-pNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am shruthi here, so about me I am technical specialist (web application
security tools) at Intouchworld.
I came to know about web application security domain from Prashant (null
and owasp chap lead).
I came to know abt Owasp special meet prog from Akash wen I met him at STPI
training.
'Hack lik a pro' by Jayesh was very informative for me as I m very much new
to this domain and I want to learn more so I can be a pen tester.
@Akash you needed some volunteers to help you out with designing I would
lik to help you wit tht stuff.

Thank you so much guys for your efforts to educate more about appsec who
are new and are willing to learn about it.

Thanks and Regards
Shruthi

But would like to share the knowledge that i have with?respect to email security , malware , antivirus , web security implementations, real time security issues etc??

I came to know abt Owasp special meet prog from Akash wen I met him at STPI

@Akash you needed some volunteers to help you out with designing I would

Thank you so much guys for your efforts to educate more about appsec who

Hi,

I am Maran (leave my complete name Marudhamaran Gunasekaran to the
government id cards and office registers;), a relative stranger at this
mailing list. Computer programming and Security fascinates me, and the
monthly nul/OWASP/G4H meets/webcasts/groups are my chances to meet like
minded fascinating professionals.

In the coming meet on Nov 22, I am going to demonstrate OWASP ZAP - an easy
to use penetration testing (read as vulnerability analysis) tool. I am a
ZAP Evangelist - a non-coding contributor to the OWASP ZAP project. With a
sample vulnerable application, I very excited to cover cover pen test
scenarios and how ZAP features come to aid. It doesn't matter if you work
for IT infra, sw development, or information security, ZAP is suitable for
all audiences. If it interests you below are the features that are waiting
for the premiere. Looking forward to meet everyone this Saturday.

Hi Everyone,

I am Anant Shrivastava, Recently joined bangalore mailing list (in
bangalore for past 2yrs), been active in multiple information security
forums like Null, garage4hackers and now at OWASP bangalore too i am
planing to to play an active role.

Professionally I am working as an Independent Security Consultant. Where i
help organizations with securing  *Mobile and web applications, and
Infrastructure.* I keep blogging about my adventures over at
http://blog.anantshri.info/

>From OWASP prospective, I am active with OWASP OWTF project, co-mentored
one GSoC student this year. I am also one of the contributing author for
OWASP Testing Guide v4.0.

I also lead 2 non-OWASP Projects

1) *Android Tamer* : A live ISO environment specifically created for
android users. This Environment allows people to work on large array of
android security related task?s ranging from Malware Analysis, Penetration
Testing and Reverse Engineering. (http://androidtamer.com/)

2) *CodeVigilant* : Code Vigilant project is created out of the need to
have a more secure open source software. It is a known fact that a large
number of users use opensource software but a very few of them contribute
back in terms of identifying and making these opensource software a more
secure piece of software. We are slowly but steadily making progress in
this project. (http://codevigilant.com/)

Feel free to contact me regarding any discussions, doubts or suggestions
for Mobile, Web application or Infrastructure or any of the above listed
projects..

Looking forward to meet all of you in next meet.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Burp - ZAP proxy chain
Message-ID: <CAOQeMO3Nbsdo24R9MrVvhs2nQwfBsFqJGZEuFY+wxSDER+xb7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

First to with introduction, my name is Sagar Belure, a security
professional, windows/linux admin, open source enthusiast. Mostly work on
Web/Network side of information security. A beginner in Digital Forensics
world of information security domain.

All right, going with query -
I have configured proxy chains in following way -
Web server -> Burp -> ZAP -> web browser

This works perfectly fine for non-SSL traffic, if I configure upstream
proxy in ZAP, pointing to burp running on different system.
1. I tried with checking "Enable unsafe SSL/TLS negotiation" under Tools ->
Options -> Certificate in ZAP, with no luck.
2. Also, tried importing burp certificate into ZAP, again no luck.

Is there any way, ZAP (or IronWASP) could be configured to upstream proxy
with SSL connection.

The error I get on firefox - "The connection was interrupted".

PS: Q. Why do I want to do that? Ans: There are few reasons. Primary and
important being, to route my traffic from my home network to target
network. Burp and ZAP are running on two separate systems. And then there
are some other reasons too.

Sagar Belure

Do you have any logs on ZAP when this fails?

Also do you get any status code in the browser when this happens?

Hi,

I am Maran (leave my complete name Marudhamaran Gunasekaran to the
government id cards and office registers;), a relative stranger at this
mailing list. Computer programming and Security fascinates me, and the
monthly nul/OWASP/G4H meets/webcasts/groups are my chances to meet like
minded fascinating professionals.

In the coming meet on Nov 22, I am going to demonstrate OWASP ZAP - an easy
to use penetration testing (read as vulnerability analysis) tool. I am a
ZAP Evangelist - a non-coding contributor to the OWASP ZAP project. With a
sample vulnerable application, I very excited to cover cover pen test
scenarios and how ZAP features come to aid. It doesn't matter if you work
for IT infra, sw development, or information security, ZAP is suitable for
all audiences. If it interests you below are the features that are waiting
for the premiere. Looking forward to meet everyone this Saturday.

Hi Everyone,

I am Anant Shrivastava, Recently joined bangalore mailing list (in
bangalore for past 2yrs), been active in multiple information security
forums like Null, garage4hackers and now at OWASP bangalore too i am
planing to to play an active role.

Professionally I am working as an Independent Security Consultant. Where i
help organizations with securing? *Mobile and web applications, and
Infrastructure.* I keep blogging about my adventures over at
http://blog.anantshri.info/

>From OWASP prospective, I am active with OWASP OWTF project, co-mentored
one GSoC student this year. I am also one of the contributing author for
OWASP Testing Guide v4.0.

I also lead 2 non-OWASP Projects

1) *Android Tamer* : A live ISO environment specifically created for
android users. This Environment allows people to work on large array of
android security related task?s ranging from Malware Analysis, Penetration
Testing and Reverse Engineering. (http://androidtamer.com/)

2) *CodeVigilant* : Code Vigilant project is created out of the need to
have a more secure open source software. It is a known fact that a large
number of users use opensource software but a very few of them contribute
back in terms of identifying and making these opensource software a more
secure piece of software. We are slowly but steadily making progress in
this project. (http://codevigilant.com/)

Feel free to contact me regarding any discussions, doubts or suggestions
for Mobile, Web application or Infrastructure or any of the above listed
projects..

Looking forward to meet all of you in next meet.

Hello all,

First to with introduction, my name is Sagar Belure, a security
professional, windows/linux admin, open source enthusiast. Mostly work on
Web/Network side of information security. A beginner in Digital Forensics
world of information security domain.

All right, going with query -
I have configured proxy chains in following way -
Web server -> Burp -> ZAP -> web browser

This works perfectly fine for non-SSL traffic, if I configure upstream
proxy in ZAP, pointing to burp running on different system.
1. I tried with checking "Enable unsafe SSL/TLS negotiation" under Tools ->
Options -> Certificate in ZAP, with no luck.
2. Also, tried importing burp certificate into ZAP, again no luck.

Is there any way, ZAP (or IronWASP) could be configured to upstream proxy
with SSL connection.

The error I get on firefox - "The connection was interrupted".

PS: Q. Why do I want to do that? Ans: There are few reasons. Primary and
important being, to route my traffic from my home network to target
network. Burp and ZAP are running on two separate systems. And then there
are some other reasons too.

Sagar Belure

Not sure, where I can see logs for ZAP. But 'History' tab does not reflect
anything.

When I check with Response headers for "The connection was interrupted" in
firefox, it gives response headers of 'about:neterror' and not from
ZAP/burp/web server.

Hi Team,

I would like to propose two probable talks.

   - Topic : Testing SSL/TLS issues : pentester approach.
   Details :
   will be tool demo but not just a single tool rather 2-3 tools and manual
   approach to validate issues. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing
   *for_Weak_SSL/TLS_Ciphers,_Insufficient_Transport_Layer_Protection*
   %28OTG-CRYPST-001%29
   <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weak_SSL/TLS_Ciphers,_Insufficient_Transport_Layer_Protection_%28OTG-CRYPST-001%29>

Would help pentesters to validate those automated findings and identify
false positives.

*if this doesn?t suites the purpose and we specifically want a OWASP tool
demo then*

   - Topic : Demo : OWTF tool.

Details : Will cover purpose of the tool, and how to use OWTF tool.

-Anant

Should someone talk about ASVS? It isn't a tool (has the potential of being
one), but a really important project and possibly, a flagship one.

Great Idea. Maybe not for the next meet as I committed for a tool demo kind
of thing. But we need to cover that for sure.

I actually have an outline for a talk that I was going to create but it
will be great if others join in.

I would prefer OWTF for now.

Getting more and more people aware about the great open source projects of
OWASP is something we need to do more and more of.

Hi Folks,

We have had an overwhelming response and our venue can accomodate only 50
people.

The following people have been sent the venue details.

*We are arranging a repeat of this workshop on 14th December 2014 (Sunday)
for people who we weren't able to accomodate. *

If there are any drop-outs, we will invite the next person in line. Please
note, this is purely on the order of registration basis and there wasn't
any selection involved.
