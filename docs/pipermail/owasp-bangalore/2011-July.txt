Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Project Jugaad released
Message-ID: <CANn_Hrx58gnA9UPUHOf-4JvC5pDWjp6Y-tD3E6OjsZNcFS-TWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've released the first version of Jugaad library. 'libjugaad' enables a
binary to inject code (as a thread) within the context of another process on
Linux. It exposes a simple API which is somewhat similar to
CreateRemoteThread() on Windows and is very easy to use.



int create_remote_thread(pid_t pid,
                                     size_t stack_size,
                                     unsigned char * tpayload,
                                     size_t tpsize,
                                     int thread_flags,
                                     int mmap_prot,
                                     int mmap_flags,
                                     void * bkpaddr);

For the knowledge hungry and for people who missed my talk at nullcon 2011,
the detail paper is uploaded on http://null.co.in/2011/07/03/project-jugaad/.
If time permits I'll also post a video on the usage and internals of the
library on SecurityTube.

Why create the library?
Because there is no such (until now :p) functionality provided by the *nix
platform for remote thread injection.

Why this email?
A request to test / use the API. Appreciate feedback from people on what
distribution it fails or if there are any bugs - as I am yet to deliver it
at defcon 2011. Your contribution (a valid bug report) would definately be
mentioned as contributor in my presentation.

Source code?
Details: http://null.co.in/2011/07/03/project-jugaad-2/
git repo: git://github.com/aseemjakhar/jugaad.git

Cheers,

Hi Team,
?
After a protracted linger, Mickey mouse won the Game in APAC. Below is a 
astonishing occasion to become a honoured member of OWASP. Believe me the 
membership has lot of benefits to the individual such as getting discounted pass 
to the conferences where you can join hands with the world leading Security 
daemons to change the world bringing security hunger. I have personally got this 
experience after been to OWASP Summit 2011. Also a certain amount of this fund 
is used to the local charter to conduct security conferences, advisory and other 
activities that really promote OWASP. This amount has been proposed by me along 
with other APAC charter leads in the board keeping in mind of all of us to join 
as members of OWASP.
?
I hope you can very much utilise this opportunity and encourage your 
peers/colleagues to become a prestigious?member of OWASP and gets benefited. 
Please reach me for the Promotional Code to utilize this opportunity. 

?
Appreciate your passion in this regard. 
?
Regards,
Gandhi Aryavalli
Global Membership Committee Member (OWASP)
