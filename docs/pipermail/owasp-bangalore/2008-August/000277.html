<PRE>Hello Everyone,

I haven't been able to do my bit of promotion (in colleges), mostly
because of my extended departure from Bangalore (part of which was
spent at OWASP Conf - Delhi :) ). Apologies for that. I'll try to do
whatever I can in the time left.
On a side note, I haven't seen any promotion mails on any mailing list
so far. I guess, we need more focus on marketing than on planning. ;)

That all being said, here is what you have to specify in all your
promotion mails/talks/presentations/persuasions-- ask them to register
for the event in advance by mailing to Hari or Syed. You could also
collect the information, in case of mass registration, and pass it
yourself. The information that could be collected is *Name*,
*Organization*, *Contact Info*.

@Akash:
Do we put up a mail on IndiaInfoSec too?

@Syed:
Did I miss something?

Regards,
Bipin Upadhyay
