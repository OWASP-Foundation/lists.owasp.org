Hi All,

I am trying to learn security/pen testing applications deployed in Docker.

How will a pen test of application deployed in Docker differ from regular
web app/ cloud app?

What are all the tools available to test Docker deployed app?

Should we testing or how should we be testing the application VM for any
known vulnerabilities?

Please share your experience working with Docker application security.

Look for misconfigurations.

Docker is just what is used to put the code in. Any persistent storage will
be in a docker volume on the actual host.
Also docker is not a vm, its a container.

Some people think docker adds to security. Thats not true.

Regards.

Hi Raju,

Docker has bit similarity as virtual box/ vmware.but instead of creating
new virtual os docker engine use existing system lib (host system). and
deploy application in same manner.  or you can think it as git.

the application run top of that are normal web application.

regards

Thank you for correcting my Docker understanding,

I would like to know if there are any vulnerability scanners available or
how can we assess security for each docker container? It is Docker which
makes one single OS with many application packages(containers), I would
like to understand how can we scan or assess each containers? Because, each
container will have different application dependencies and how can we make
sure all containers are safe against known vulnerabililties.

If there are any vulnerability scanners available to do the job? We use
QualysGuard and Nexpose for our vulnerability scanning. Please let me know
if these has features of scanning Docker containers.

Regards,
Raju
