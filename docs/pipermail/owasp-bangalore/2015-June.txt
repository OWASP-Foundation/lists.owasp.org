Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] AppSecUSA Chapter Discount Program
Message-ID: <CA+QUGmOQVmHXxVsuMTk1EooZyguSPtaxxYsu_GSkxq5siZsHOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,


The orgs of AppSecUSA are providing OWASP chapters with a discount to the
conference and a chance to earn free tickets to the event.

OWASP Bangalore can get a coupon code which will shave off $100 from the
conference ticket price.

Additionally if 5 of such coupons are used, OWASP Bangalore will get 1 free
ticket to the conference.

If enough of you show interest, we will apply to get these coupons.

Do let me know on the list itself.

Thank you.

Akash Mahajan

Regarding web application testing,
web application hackers handbook covers almost everything. it is also
cheaper than the beginners guide.
http://www.amazon.in/The-Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook/dp/8126533404/

TCP IP Illustrated volume 2 is more into programming and not concepts.
Volume 1 is the concepts book that is good to understand the protocols.
Volume 2 is the programming edition and needs volume 1 to understand
the concepts.
Douglas Comer's Internetworking With TCP/IP are also regarded equally
good and follow a similar pattern.

Between WAHH and Beginners Guide the latter does a better job of explaining 
context. While WAHH is brilliant at covering all aspects of app sec for web 
sometimes, the reader does need to be able to understand the concept with 
the whole picture. 

For the basics and getting started the Beginners Guide is definitely more 
suitable IMHO.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Javascript function for cookie.
Message-ID: <CA+G3S3hWELM8X036QZwYcNOHh5tp+zrE=dC+91dxs1B5zNWzQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Another awesome Owasp bangalore meet, wish we have frequently such meets.

As we discussed, we can start a study group to learn Online courses and
complete a application security book :)

As a takeaway from our last meet, i started looking at javascripts
(Suggested by Akash) from test application noticed a cookie.js javascript.
I suspect there could be some vulnerability in this javascript. I am
struggling to decode it, i am not very good in programing. Can someone
please help me to understand below javascript snippet. Please let me know
if you require any other information.

// sets a cookie
function SetCookie( name, value, expires )
{
    var today = new Date();
    today.setTime( today.getTime() );

    if ( expires ) {
        expires = expires * 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
    }

    var expires_date = new Date( today.getTime() + (expires) );

    document.cookie = name + "=" +escape( value ) +
    ( ( expires ) ? ";expires=" + expires_date.toGMTString() : "" );
}

// this function gets the cookie, if it exists
function GetCookie( name )
{
    var start = document.cookie.indexOf( name + "=" );
    var len = start + name.length + 1;
    if ( ( !start ) &&
         ( name != document.cookie.substring( 0, name.length ) ) )
    {
        return null;
    }
    if ( start == -1 ) return null;
    var end = document.cookie.indexOf( ";", len );
    if ( end == -1 ) end = document.cookie.length;
    return unescape( document.cookie.substring( len, end ) );
}

// this deletes the cookie when called
function DeleteCookie( name )
{
    if ( GetCookie( name ) )
        document.cookie = name + "=" +
        ";expires=Thu, 01-Jan-1970 00:00:01 GMT";
}

I definitely missed the meet . And could not get context of this script as
well.
Yet i thought of replying with the understanding since i developed a script
very similar to this one in past.

Ok before jumping into the script we would be aware
*Javascript cannot delete an cookie.*
we can write javascripts only to change expire time-stamp of an cookie.

So GetCookie iterates through all the cookie that browser has stored for
THE domain to look for a particular cookie say JSESSIONID. PHPSESSIONID or
so.
DeleteCookie expires the cookie which we got from GetCookie by setting
expire time-tamp to 1 Jan 1970 (A Timestamp very familiar to Java
developers )
SetCookie adds another 24 hours to cookie expiry.

Hi,
In one of our web application, we have a url ending with partition id=1.
When I add an escape character ( ' ), it is giving me an internal server
error. Apart from that, when I paste the below code in in url feild, I got
a "invalid data request" error.
By seeing these, can anyone help me to identify whether there is chance of
SQL injection in our application?



Thanks
Sadiq

I am guessing there is some sort of string blacklisting in place and when
you try to use SQL codes, it would give you invalid data requests?

Try encoding your payloads that you test and look if they bypass the WAF.
Start with something like UnIoN, un/**/ion, etc.
