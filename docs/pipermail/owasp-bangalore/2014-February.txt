Hi All,

My name is Murugesh and I recently joined this group.

I'm interested in learning more about Web Application Security. I'm looking
for good training institutes in Bangalore who conduct trainings/workshops,
with hands-on exercises.

If someone can share details on this, it would be helpful. Thanks for your
assistance in advance.

Regards,
Murugesh Vadivel
