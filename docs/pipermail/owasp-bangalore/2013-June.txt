Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] CFP Extended, Do it now!
Message-ID: <CA+Rr0=6cek_PW7mSobXq8uwPSrvhhfk5uHqicpzRqf+BShwBkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Good News for information security experts who couldn't yet submit their
papers for "OWASP InfoSec India Conference 2013" happening at Hotel Crowne
Plaza, Gurgaon, New Delhi NCR, India from August 30-31, 2013.

With few great papers submitted already, we would like to take this
opportunity to extend the CFP submission dates to 10 more days in order to
allow maximum participation.

CFP is now closing on June 25th, 2013, more details can be found at:
http://2013.owasp.in/category/cfp/

Don't miss out the opportunity to present your paper to a vibrant
information security community of CIOs, CISOs, investigators, policy
makers, INTs, defense, CERTs in the cyber city and national capital region
of India.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv Soi
Chair - OWASP India

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Certified Web Application Security Professional -
	Training Workshop
Message-ID: <CA+dehJDpqceim+qC7Xd+2uFtdQHZfj9+pOANjTmHPJ3==KFGFw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Bangalore OWASPians

My company is hosting a first-of-its-kind training workshop on Web
Application Security called WCWASP (we45 Certified Web Application Security
Professional) in Bangalore on July 24 and 25th 2013. After our success with
this program in Oman, Vietnam and Bahrain, we have decided to bring it to
India.

Its a in-depth training program meant for Developers, Architects, Security
and Risk Professionals. The program is replete with case studies, examples
and code snippets. Participants will be provided with vulnerable web apps
that they can test. We will be delving into Web Application Security Best
practices across multiple platforms. The workshop will also highlight
application security requirements for multiple compliance requirements like
PCI, ISO and so on. *Herewith attached is the program brochure for your
perusal.*

I am confident that you, members from your technology teams, security teams
and so on will derive great value from this program. You can also

Regards
Abhay

Forwarding from the null list.

Any thoughts on how this will change your plans about security testing?

I personally plan to update my training content and security testing
approach in 3-6 months.

The much anticipated OWASP Top Ten 2013 List was Officially Released on
June 12, 2013. Seems like Injection flaws are still holding No. 1 position
since 2010 and Broken Authentication and Session management flaws has taken
one position above Cross site scripting (XSS).

Interesting ....
