Hello Everyone,
 
Thank you for taking interest in joining the group. 
 
As I mentioned in my introduction mail, OWASP concentrates on spreading
the importance of security and provides a platform for sharing
information and best practices related to the group. Most of the
information is available on the official web site of OWASP -
www.owasp.org <http://www.owasp.org/>  and if you have any questions
regarding the same, please don't hesitate to call / email me. 
 
Regarding the activities of OWASP-Bangalore Chapter, we need to
meet/discuss over the mailing list to see how we can proceed. 
 
Can anyone suggest any place for our meet? As the group is not too huge
(we have around 12 interested members subscribed to the list), we can
meet in some common place and introduce ourselves and go forward. 
 
Any suggestions for our meeting?
 
Your Partner in Learning,
Hari

Hello everyone on the mailing list. How are you all and how are things
going? 
 
I sent my first email couple of weeks back and unfortunately there is no
response. Can we all meet once to plan and discuss the future of OWASP
Bangalore Chapter? 
 
I also wanted to share that, I am trying for the recognition of our
meetings so that each meeting can be counted for CPE Credits for the
CISSP Exam. 
 
Please let me know a comfortable time and place so that we can plan for
meeting.
 
Your Partner in Learning,
Hari

Hi all,
Since everyone of us in this group are working professionals so it is better we go for some weekend.

Hi Hari,

That would be a good idea.
But let us know the duration of the meeting so that it would be better
to decide on when to meet

When the going gets tough, the tough get going.

Hello Co-OWASP Enthusiast's,
 
Thanks for the immediate response. The time for the meeting should not
be more than an hour as this is the first time we are meeting. And also,
as mentioned I really don't mind if it is a weekend or a weekday. 
 
I work in the heart of the city on Kasturba Road, so meeting any where
in the city is not a problem for me. 
 
For the moment, until our group gets recognized and we have more number
of people joining us, any Coffee Day outlet or Barista outlet should
suffice our requirement. What do you say? 
 
Pitch in your thoughts.
 
Your Partner in Learning,
Hari

Hi All,

 

This sounds fine to me.

 

As I work in one corner of Bangalore, a week day meeting after 7 PM should
be great.

 

Thanks

 

V Anand
