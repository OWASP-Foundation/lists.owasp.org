<PRE>Hi Team,
&#160;
After a protracted linger, Mickey mouse won the Game in APAC. Below is a 
astonishing occasion to become a honoured member of OWASP. Believe me the 
membership has lot of benefits to the individual such as getting discounted pass 
to the conferences where you can join hands with the world leading Security 
daemons to change the world bringing security hunger. I have personally got this 
experience after been to OWASP Summit 2011. Also a certain amount of this fund 
is used to the local charter to conduct security conferences, advisory and other 
activities that really promote OWASP. This amount has been proposed by me along 
with other APAC charter leads in the board keeping in mind of all of us to join 
as members of OWASP.
&#160;
I hope you can very much utilise this opportunity and encourage your 
peers/colleagues to become a prestigious&#160;member of OWASP and gets benefited. 
Please reach me for the Promotional Code to utilize this opportunity. 

&#160;
Appreciate your passion in this regard. 
&#160;
Regards,
Gandhi Aryavalli
Global Membership Committee Member (OWASP)

Hello,

OWASP has recently announced a new membership model.&#160; Now you might be able to 
pay a discounted membership while enjoying the full benefits of a OWASP member.&#160; 
For example, the regular&#160; annual membership fee is $50, but people from some 
developing countries pay only $20.&#160; To find out how to take advantage of this 
discount, just send an email to your chapter leader or reply to this email.&#160; 


Benefits of OWASP members include professional association, voting rights for 
OWASP elections, as well as discounted attendance at OWASP conferences.&#160; For 
example, if you are a member, then there is no charge to attend AppSec Asia 2011 
in Beijing, China from November 8 to 11.

OWASP is a worldwide not-for-profit organization.&#160; For the last ten years, it 
provides free, open and unbiased application security materials to the public.&#160; 
Your donation supports your local chapter and other operational costs.&#160; To 
become a proud member today, please go to 
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Please_Join_Usand">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Please_Join_Usand</A> then click on the
