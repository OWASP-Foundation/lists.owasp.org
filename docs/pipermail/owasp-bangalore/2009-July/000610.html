Subject: Q3 Update OWASP NEWS
To: OWASP Worldwide Mailing List &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-bangalore">owasp-all at lists.owasp.org</A>&gt;


Wanted to communicate a Q3 update about OWASP Foundation to all
mailing list members on a couple of high-level items.

#0 - OWASP @ Blackhat 2009 - If you will making the trip to #Blackhat
(that's twitter speak) be
sure to join us for the OWASP breakout briefing about Critical
Infrastructures July 29, 16:45 in Genoa room this is the OFFICIAL
meet-up.

#1 - OWASP EU Poland Videos are now online (thanks Seba) and people
can quickly get to them by going to <A HREF="http://www.owasp.tv">http://www.owasp.tv</A>    or
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2009_-_Poland">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2009_-_Poland</A> see
OWASP blip videos share any of them with your teams = free SDLC
training

#2 -  OWASP board meetings have been happening every month for
sometime now. One of the most common questions I get personally is
&quot;what happened at the last meeting...&quot; well its not a secret ivory
tower actually - we keep agenda's and results of each monthly meeting
ensuring that the OWASP ethics and principals are being adhered to.
So you can find this information both historic and future meetings
online see: <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Board_Meetings">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Board_Meetings</A> -
should you have a topic that you feel is critical for OWASP Foundation
we request that you communicate first with the appropriate Global
Committee as the purpose of these groups is to be a VOICE for each
region in the world and then focus on a defined mission with a team of
energy filled persons see:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Pages">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Pages</A> note each
committee is led by a board member as well.

Questions about money, tax returns etc., are all located online as
well see: <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Foundation">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Foundation</A> and managed
by Alison, what other professional technology group do you belong to
that is this transparent?

#3 - Global Committee's brings out another point - if you would like
to help OWASP continue to grow and have some cycles for selflessness
volunteerism or simply a suggestion based on your experiences - join
the mailing list and or contact the Global Committee
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Pages">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Pages</A> the best way to
change the world is to start with your local chapter, then region the
globally.

#4 - OWASP PodCasts <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Podcast">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Podcast</A>  got
questions, comments or feedback for Jim Manico and team that have been
working very hard to bring you interviews with AppSec folks globally,
let them know send a email to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-bangalore">podcast at owasp.org</A> with your comments and
favorite episode and why.

#5 - OWASP Projects have been updated. Have a review of the existing
ones as well as detailed how-to on new projects see:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project</A>

#6 - HELP WANTED - The OWASP Job Board has lots of active postings of
firms looking for the best in the industry, if you are looking for
employment or if it is time to change gears and accelerate your career
visit <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs</A> to have a look around

#7 - OWASP Conferences -
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference</A>  the
USA, DC OWASP event is going to be a BIG event plan now to attend it
lock in your hotels and travel early.  If you would like to host a
conference in 2010 be sure to contact Kate Hartmann with your proposal
for consideration for 2010.

#8 - OWASP GRANTS/SoC want to work on a OWASP project?  Want to
sponsor a OWASP project take the time to review the following:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Season_of_Code_2009">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Season_of_Code_2009</A>
