<PRE>Hi Natarajan,

Not sure if you have already evaluated these, but some other commercial scanners I know are Cenzic, WebInspect, Appscan. I heard false positives are less in Cenzic but tool is  not user friendly. Webinspect, is easy to navigate, gives users multiple options to customize their scans with various crawling methods. Privilege escalation checks and some of the authorization checks can be done in Cenzic but is not available with Web Inspect. Pricing part, I think web inspect is costlier than Cenzic.

Thank you,

SEKHAR

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Suggestion for a good Web security scanner

Hi Fellow OWASPers,

I've been trying to evaluate tools that would help me find XSS and other security loopholes on a given site.

Scanmus is one that is not available to anyone outside of Yahoo!
Acunetix is another that I found.
Burpsuite Professional doesn't let users trial the software before buying it.
It is difficult to evaluate these software without getting hold of a copy.

Any suggestions or pointers from your experiences would be highly appreciated

PS: Excuse me about cross posting to bangalore and chennai lists, incase there are people subscribed to both.

Thanks,
Rajagopal
