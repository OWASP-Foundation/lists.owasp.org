<PRE>Hi Team,
&#160;
It was nice talking to you through this email.&#160; I am Gandhi working with McAfee, 
had a chance to participate in OWASP - Global Summit, Portugal from India.&#160; 
There were lot of things that I have discussed regarding OWASP (India), and 
would like to share few highlights in our next meet.
&#160;
Could you please let me know are we all have a common place to meet (similar to 
NULCON), and do similar sessions every 3rd or 4th of every month, such that we 
will be all meeting in a common place.
&#160;
Also would like to know a volunteer that will be the single point of contact for 
organising these events, and share the updates on Information Security as OWASP 
rest of the charters were really doing well compared to India charter, and we do 
have plan to organise a world summit in 2012 in India - especially Bangalore.
&#160;
I would like to know the challenges of improving our Bangalore community very 
well, and would like to support on each and every activity.&#160; Feel free to share 
your thoughts on our next OWASP meet (separate - I know we are all meeting in 
NULL) to discuss on the challenges, and chalk out a plan to make OWASP 
(Bangalore) grow bigger.
&#160;
Also could you please send&#160;to ME&#160;the list of the audience who are currently in 
the list of the community in the below format, such that I'll consolidate and 
share the details to the thread such that every one knows who we are all 
about...
