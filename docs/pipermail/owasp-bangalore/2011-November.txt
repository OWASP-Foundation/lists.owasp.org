Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Session Fixation counter: Asp.Net
Message-ID: <CAGsSLnXrDS8YP813YxZ+vL8N0gUSArV0s_gJnA=LjwJPVVsugQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I am looking for the mitigation of Session fixation vulnerability on ASP
.NET platform. My development team is unable to devise the solution to
change the session id post-authentication. Please help me in this regard.

I am looking for something synonymous to PHP's session_regenerate_id() in
ASP .NET. Other solutions are greatly appreciated.

Thanks in anticipation
Vaibhav Gupta
