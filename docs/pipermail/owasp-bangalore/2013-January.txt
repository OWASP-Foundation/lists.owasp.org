Hi Saran,

Apologies for the delayed reponse. I completely forgot to check emails in
OWASP last week!

We have a combined meetup of OWASP/null/SecurityXploded/G4H on the 19th of
Jan already planned with sessions. I am working on coming out with a simple
calendar of meets we can do over the next year.

Most likely the next OWASP meet should be in Feb sometime. We can have your
session then.
I will keep the list updated.

Thank you.

Shaadi.com has already fix this (after that only m disclosing!) As
this clearly indicates it is very easy to get other people profile,
modify, send interest to other profile, accept/reject interest, Modify
profile, see contact number etc,   If you/your friends are on
shaadi.com   you/they want to cross verify each details once again.

You may want to share with your friends with good intention and ask
them to double check with their profile/interest and other things
(more detail is in the link above)

Hi Raxit,

I appreciate that you have reported this issue and it has been fixed.

But please stop doing a reply all. Ideally you shouldn't be cross posting
in the first place.

Thank you.

Akash & other hackers!

Good Morning,

Intention of X-posting was bit different, And now marking only
owasp-null, coz i know here are some of the best guys who can
understand this!

Just i was approached by one of the employee of People group (i think
it is best to not disclose his name!) and he wrote,  Copy pasting

"Hats off to you Buddy !! i have done a Cyber Security Presentation
and informed about all the open cs threats to our CEO Mr.Anupam Mittal
and all the Business Heads in October 2012 but unfortunately many of
them were ignored by the technical team but today i really feel proud
after you gave the reality check to them, i am very proud of you. I am
from Navi Mumbai working with Shaadi.com People Group, worked with
<snipped>  earlier..."


Nothing new,  Many times Big/Small companies keep ignoring suggestions
from their internal team.  We will fix only if someone will report it
(in B2C), We will fix only if client will ask us multiple time (in
B2B) kind of stuff!

Any similar experience with anyone?
