<PRE>Hi Vinod,

I don&#8217;t think any tool or algorithm available to calculate avg time to fix the vulnerabilities. It depends on the developer experience and the complexity of the vulnerability. But if you are working on a product it is possible to derive on your own.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Details on effort needed to remediate the static scan findings.

Hi All,

I am trying to create an algorithm to calculate the total effort in man hours to fix the findings from a web static scan. Please let me know if there is any good and recognized source from where I could get the details like average time to fix different vulnerabilities like  SQLi or XSS and so on.

Regards,
