Dear OWASP Chapter Leader or Board Member, 

You are receiving this email because you are listed on the OWASP wiki as the leader (or part of the leadership) of an OWASP Chapter. To ensure that all Chapter Leaders are aware of their responsibilities as well as the resources available to help them with their chapter, we are requesting that all OWASP Chapter Leaders read and agree to the revised Chapter Handbook (completed in December 2011).  The Handbook is available on the OWASP Wiki: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Leader_Handbook

Additionally, as a point of information, the funds available for each chapter (updated through the end of 2011) are available on the Donation Scorecard here:  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Donation_Scoreboard.  All funds are listed in USD and if your chapter is not listed, then your chapter account balance is zero.

Please submit your Chapter Handbook acknowledgement through this Google Form:  https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dF92bVI0bXRIUU85SHVwdUdlSHIyQmc6MQ no later than the end of February 2012. A response is requested from each member of a chapter's leadership team  and if we do not receive your response by then, we will assume you are "opting out" of chapter leadership going forward.  If no responses are received for a chapter, we will consider that chapter inactive.  Any funds will be donated to the foundation to support the Chapter Committee on a global scale.

Regards,

Sarah Baso on behalf of the
OWASP Global Chapter Committee

Dear OWASP Chapter Leader,

This is the 4th email (original below) that has been sent to you requesting acknowledgement of the revised chapter handbook and confirmation that you are still interested in continuing as chapter leader.  We have not received any response from your chapter and if none is received by the end of February (in one week), we will move forward with tagging your chapter as inactive.  This will also result in the funds allocated to your chapter being reallocated to help other chapters.

I suspect quite a few people receiving this email are new chapter leaders who don't think it is necessary to respond because they just started their chapter... We need ALL chapter leaders who are currently active to respond.

Thanks for your time in completing the google form: https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dF92bVI0bXRIUU85SHVwdUdlSHIyQmc6MQ
