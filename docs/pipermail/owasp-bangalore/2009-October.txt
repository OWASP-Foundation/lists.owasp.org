Hi OWASP,

I am writing this such that it can be informed to concerned authorities.
I tried to find mail id of the respective institue to inform them but
could'nt find any.

Details are as follows....
Visit to anypage on* http://www.nagarjunauniversity.ac.in*
and right click to "View Source", we'll find the following site embedded in
iframe *http://bale.ws/show.php*
When we open above site it gets redirected to *
http://superpupermegacasino.com/* which hosts *SmartDownload.exe*

Details of the EXE at virustotal is shown as *Win32/CasOnline!Adware*
http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/9709a6f32be02642671f96ee264bae85fc924072ceb1a6f07c94ab94ae77943d-1254763534


the page has eval() and base64_decode() methods. When we decode the base64
content site *esli.tw* is embedded.

There is one more site embedded *http://b.nt002.cn/E/J.JS*

When we visit few pages on this site and if any AV is installed on ur
machine (McAfee AntiVirus is installed in my case and triggers PDF-Exploit
alert) it should trigger some alert.

Interested folks can further analyze. Please inform concerned guys from
Nagarjuna University.

Best Regards,
Praveen Darshanam,
Security Researcher

Unbelievable !! Just wondering why no one there at the university didn't
notice this and rectify this..
Also, I would really appreciate if some could one explain how the malicious
site did this on a seemingly reputed university's site.. Any inputs?

Rgds,
Sajin.

This is not very surprising. I have found several XSS vulnerabilities with
some very reputed universities and B-schools across the country (I shall not
name them). I have sent several mails to them and reported the issue, but it
is obviously not of high priority for them. I believe that, in some cases,
they dont know how to fix the problem also.

This phenomenon of embedded and obfuscated Javascript is common of the
Nine-ball and Gumblar worms. You might want to report this problem in such a
light.

Abhay

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] India Income Tax Mail and Phishing Site
Message-ID: <3ea7730b0910182349t6a4d9a44od64e1707772143d2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys,

Today I received a mail from the sender ?India Tax Departament? that I am
yet to receive the tax refund amount. The first this I did was to check the
sender email id and it was from ?*wnrlky at aol.com*?. I can assume that this
id has been long used for phishing attacks (the id resembles ?winnerlucky?).


Knowing that this is a phishing mail I wanted to check the link which was
embedded. The site to which I was redirected was surprisingly similar to the
actual India IT site. The site contained a form which accepts the credit
card and other details.

Please check this page for the complete details :
