Hi All,

To make sure our update broadcasts are send quickly and reach all, we can
use Google Labs SMS Channels at http://labs.google.co.in/smschannels/browse,
which helps us like the google docs share.
As we already have google accounts, we can create a private channel and get
ourselves subscribed to it and the OWASP blr moderator(s) can post messages
which we receive as SMS on our mobiles.

Hope it helps.

regards,
Niranjan

Saurabh,

Please go this presentation regarding the risks with OpenID :
http://www.slideshare.net/rohit11/risks-with-openid-presentation

About no-techie users :
If they are in US, they most likely have AOL account. AOL provides
OpenID, and so does Yahoo. More likely than not, they already have
Yahoo account. So it might be worth the try.

Wordpress allows the comments to be OpenID enabled, but in case user
doesn't have OpenID, s/he can go through normal routine of providing
name/email when posting comment. You can try similar option, enable
OpenID access, but don't make that the "only" option. Allow the users
to create "yet another username password pair" if they are OK with it.

-Mandar

ensure that we take this project forward.

Coming to the next meeting, I was thinking it would be good to have our meet
at BarCamp Bangalore 7 which is happening on the 7/8 March at Yahoo.

Yup! Feels good... and I guess you were right Hari. The group was indeed 
waiting for me to leave Bangalore :(

Are the presentations/docs being uploaded somewhere?

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] OWASP Project: WebGoat | Simulation for web
	attacks
Message-ID: <213064.22185.qm@web95415.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hi Everyone,

Yesterday, I was just browsing through OWASP website, when I found this tool named as WebGoat. Today only, I installed it and started working on it and found it very informative. This application is basically for novice like me, who wants to have hands on experience of attacks.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project


WebGoat is a deliberately insecure J2EE web
application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web
application security lessons. In each lesson, users must demonstrate their
understanding of a security issue by exploiting a real vulnerability in the
WebGoat application. For example, in one of the lessons the user must use SQL
injection to steal fake credit card numbers. The application is a realistic
teaching environment, providing users with hints and code to further explain
the lesson.

Regards,
Vikas

Its not that way Bipin; you took so long to bring this group to Barcamp from
where things took better shape :-) I echo Hari's idea. It will help draw
more members for sure.

Again, we can use the Google Docs here to upload and share our documents :)
Google recently started supporting presentation files in ppt format, in  
addition to spreadsheet, pdf, word and forms.

Lakshman,

Please subscribe to
http://labs.google.co.in/smschannels/channel/OwaspBangalore created by
Sundar. We are thinking of having it along with Barcamp (
barcampbangalore.org) on Mar 7th or 8th. Venue would be Y! Bangalore. But
wait for the confirmation.

Hari/Sundar,
Do we need to do something specific to have our meeting as part of Barcamp
(other than ofcourse adding sharmishtha's session there)?

Thanks,
-Sumit

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] [Open Discussion] Security Breach -- What to do !
Message-ID: <3895ddbf0902160903m180cd7e9sc29af57cb1bcf880@mail.gmail.com>

Hi  Dinesh

interesting discussion , forwarding to various relavant groups.



Ok ! So context is... you have found some security loophole in XYZ site, you
inform the concerned company that there is critical loophole, which can
breach security/privacy or both. [Please note, these sites are having
thousands of active users !].

Now there are few possibilities....after disclosing technical details to
concerned site....

1.  Ex. Like Myntra.... They were get back to us, fixed within few days.
After that disclosed publically, there was some critical bug !

Note :  check this url for further info.
http://www.pluggd.in/wtf/myntra-invoice-hack-3409/

Good. Atleast site owner has taken the steps to protect their user data !

2.

However i had talk with copule of folks, who has reported some critical
security breach to some Big Guys (or Small guys ! not matter !).  Now  these
site owners are falling into this category, they are not listening. Their
sites are up for security/privacy breach.  Even after informing to them, and
waiting for 5-6 days or 2 week, they are not even caring to even reply Nor
they are fixing it ! What do you think, what should be done ? Assume,  Site
is still open for hack what should one do ?

Any IT-Act in place  ?


Should report to  CERT-India ?


Cybercrime (normally i found cybercrime is active when anyone reports any
online harrasment or lottery fraud. but not for Application or site is  up
for hack]


Or Should publish to blog, and disclose everything to public without caring
all that legal issues ?


Or Any other thoughts ????

How about including this discussion (khullam khulla) as an agenda item
in the next meet ?

It willgive me some more real stuff for my blog !! And maybe a case
study on the pathetic attitude of the "big guys" towards private
information.

Hi

Its high time that the vulnerability is disclosed to public forums so that
the vendors/site developers are forced to fix it.

Please go ahead and submit at sites like xssed.com<http://www.xssed.com/submit>
,cert.org <https://forms.cert.org/VulReport/> etc.

Fyi, statement of Xssed in submission page

"Submit cross-site scripting vulnerabilities using the form below (HTTP
response splitting, frame redirect and other vulnerabilities that can be
exploited against users are also allowed).
Note: Script insertion vulnerabilities, which can lead to cross-site
scripting, can also be used to damage the site by blocking its visual
access, note that it could represent a crime in many countries and we do not
support this action. *Once the mirror has been validated and published, you
should contact the webmasters of the affected web site and help them to fix
the flaw.*"


Statement of Cert in the submission page

"We accept reports of security vulnerabilities and serve as a coordinating
body that works with affected vendors to resolve vulnerabilities. If you
believe you have found a security
vulnerability<https://forms.cert.org/VulReport/vrf_instructions.jsp#vulnerabilities>
that
has not been resolved, please complete the following form. As our vulnerability
disclosure policy <http://www.cert.org/kb/vul_disclosure.html> explains, we
send information submitted in vulnerability reports to affected vendors. By
default, we will share your name with vendors and publicly acknowledge you
in documents we publish. If you do not want us to share your name or
publicly acknowledge you, select the appropriate responses below."

Go ahead and submit, as a precaution send the disclosed info to the vendor.
There is nothing illegal unless you exploit the vulnerability.

Please check this link to know about Full
Disclosure<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure>
 concept.

Message-ID: <6b0ba69c0902252048i6e5ad9e4udfeaeeb5a0183e96@mail.gmail.com>

Hi team,

Need your help here.
I work as an infosec manager and I have a strange request from a dev
team for an application security assessment tool!
I know it sounds little naive, but what they are looking for is
something in the lines of Nessus but are ok if it?s not comprehensive
one.
They did understood when I explained about OWASP guidelines, OWASP top
ten, SANS/MITRE top 25, webappsec.org, etc.. For them, a tool which
can quickly scan and give out vulnerabilities/ exploits quickly is
desired.

Google for web vulnerability scanners

I would start with http://sectools.org/web-scanners.html

I have personally used nikto a lot. You can customize it easily.
I also use twill, selenium proxy as well.

Have heard nice things about appscan and acunetix. But haven't used
them personally.

If they are curious about learning they can try out web scarab and web goat

Niranjan - I am a great fan of open source security tools, sadly there
aren't comparable tools like Nessus on the application front from the
open source.

Having used AppScan, WebInspect and Acunetix, I would recommend
AppScan for several reasons. I have used these tools over hundreds of
applications over several years. There were times when WebInspect lead
the pack. Since a year or so I find AppScan a few steps well ahead of
WebInspect.

I work for IBM, that might give you a feeling of biased opinion. I
recommend you run WebInspect and AppScan evaluation versions at your
end and learn for yourself as to what best meets your requirement.

All the best!

Dear Niranjan,

Acunetix is a wonderful tool for finding vulnerabilities.
But only problem is its commercial. But you can find cracked version of it
by doing some R & D on net.
It will solve your purpose.

WebInspect is another $ good one. If it is one time requirement, you may try an Eval 15 days copy.

Hi Niranjan,

You can also use commercial tools like Canvas, CoreImpact etc. for scanning
and finding vulnerabilities.
