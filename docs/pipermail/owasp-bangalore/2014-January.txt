based on pre-determined conditions and scan the code for different
vulnerabilities.

10:50 - 11:20:  Struts Validation Framework: Part 2 - Satish
This session is the second part of the talk on Validation frameworks. These
frameworks are used to secure information from entering business model in
an MVC architecture. ?Struts Validation framework? is a set of predefined

Hi All,

I am trying to create an algorithm to calculate the total effort in man hours to fix the findings from a web static scan. Please let me know if there is any good and recognized source from where I could get the details like average time to fix different vulnerabilities like  SQLi or XSS and so on.

Hi Vinod,

I don't think you can get any sort of average time (which is reliable) for
fixing XSS etc. unless you can freeze on the language, framework and a
particular coding standard.

Hi Vinod,

I don?t think any tool or algorithm available to calculate avg time to fix the vulnerabilities. It depends on the developer experience and the complexity of the vulnerability. But if you are working on a product it is possible to derive on your own.

The schedule for this month's meet is as outlined below:

09:30 - 10:10:  Web Application Security for Beginners: DOM Based XSS -
Jayesh Singh
This is a multipart series on Web Application Security. This session will
cover part 2 of the DOM based XSS subsection, the identification and
concepts behind it. The session will also cover filter bypasses and
different XSS payloads in that context.

10:10 - 10:20:  Introductions

10:20 - 10:50: Automated Source code review using Fortify - Rupam
Bhattacharya
This talk+demo will cover the automated source code review tool called
Fortify . The demo will show on how to configure Fortify, select rules
based on pre-determined conditions and scan the code for different
vulnerabilities.

10:50 - 11:20:  Struts Validation Framework: Part 2 - Satish
This session is the second part of the talk on Validation frameworks. These
frameworks are used to secure information from entering business model in
an MVC architecture. ?Struts Validation framework? is a set of predefined
plugin codes which have proven best practices in Data validation. We will
take a look at the working of the framework and understand how malicious
data is treated.

11:20 - 11:40:  Networking and Break

11:40 - 12:20:  Security Onion  - Nishanth Kumar
"Security Onion" is an full Linux distribution with packet capture,
network-based and host-based intrusion detection intrusion detection
systems (NIDS and HIDS, respectively) and other powerful analysis tools.
The talk will cover the following aspects of this OS:
 1. Introduction of Security Onion
2. Tools included in the OS and usage of these tools for exploitation.
3. How to do Analysis of Packets using tools

12:20 - 12:50: Web Application Security: The pitfalls and the brickwalls, a
developer perspective - Vamsi Krishna
This is a multi-part series on common developer mistakes that result in
major security vulnerabilities. This month we will see how unsanitized data
causes SQL injection due to poor programming practices. We will also take a
look at Insecure Direct Object references where a developer does not
anticipate a permission model for objects resulting in unauthorized access
to data.

12:50 - 13:10:  Feedback and Topic discussion for next month meet

Hi All,

I was looking for Web Application Firewall. Any opinions, which WAF should
I go for.

I looked into following options for comparision.

   - Fortify Defender
   - Imperva
   - Armorlogic Profense Web Application Firewall
   - XyberShield

Eventhough Commercial firewalls are good as they are more supported and
updated
What do you think about Mod Security WAF

http://www.modsecurity.org/

And How  is Mod WAF compared to
https://www.barracuda.com/products/webapplicationfirewall?

I once deployed Citrix Netscaler .. it is an excellent WAF ... and has
other capabilities too

Among the responses, I like the Mod Security suggestion.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Registration Closed | OWASP Bangalore Special
	Meet on 8th Feb 2014
Message-ID: <CA+QUGmOh=-XRpkpj8UaUEaDR7+TzXva15jn_2bmW5t_T6N6owA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

We have closed the registration for the OWASP Bangalore Special Meet on 8th
of Feb 2014. We have an allowed capacity of 50 and the number of
registrations has far exceeded this number.

So this is what is going to happen now.

1. If you are a paid member of OWASP you will be given a confirmed seat.
2. For everyone else we will invite based on timestamp.

In case you have registered but are not able to make it please do let me
know so that we can offer the seat to someone else.

Please expect an email today or tomorrow for confirmation.

Thank you.

Warm regards,
Akash Mahajan

The first set of folks who registered have been sent the details for
confirmation of attendance.

We are looking at streamlining registration and RSVP for further events.
