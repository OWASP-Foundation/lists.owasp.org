<PRE>Hi All,

Just was curious to bring the topic &quot;Recession Vs Enterprise Security&quot; topic
to limelight. This has been discussed a lot in various other forums
now-a-days but wanted to know what you guys have to say about this.

There are two possible consequences of global recession.

1. Management will start thinking that security is an add-on for existing
business, considered as an additional expense than investments/ future
benefits. This will reduce the importance of security guys around.

2. Hackers understand that security measures are relaxed due to budget
constrains, which will make their lives easier. More and more hackers
evolve. This implies opportunity for people in security domain and keeps
them busy.

These two possibilities are absolutely contradictory when we consider the
impact of recession on security domain.

So what do you guys say. Which is most probable to happen 1 or 2 ???

RegardsRajiv
