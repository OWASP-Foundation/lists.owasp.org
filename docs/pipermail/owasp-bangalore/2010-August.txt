>From my experience, website defacement does not bother people much unless
there is some financial implication. That may be the reason companies are
lax about it. Moreover, I see CISOs find it very hard to get budgets for
this unless the management takes it seriously.

Someone asked about awareness programs... DSCI Bangalore Chapter has started
some work on the same. They are targeting various groups that you have
mentioned. But they have not rolled it out. Yday I read that some kid had
written syllabus for schools/colleges to address cyber security. If Govt
bites into that, it would be a good start.

Application security is more concern in the SDLC. As a fresher I want to start my career as Appsec professional, could any one explain how to start.

Thanks

Good day Kishore,

I would recommend starting off by making sure you have a good foundation of
knowledge. Mr. Mark Merkow is one of the leading authorities in this area
and has just released a fantastic book on this very subject.  You can find
out everything about this book by going to
http://www.crcpress.com/ecommerce_product/product_detail.jsf?isbn=9781439826
966

I can attest to Mark's knowledge, skills and abilities from first-hand
knowledge, as I have known and worked with Mark for years.  Mark is also the
Lead Course Architect for SCIPP International's Secure Web-Application
Development Awareness course that covers the principles of secure coding and
the OWASP Top-10.  More information on that course can be found at
http://www.scippinternational.org/secure-web-applications-training.html

We all wish you luck in your endeavors and applaud your desire to understand
the need to incorporate security within the SDLC process.

Best wishes,

don
