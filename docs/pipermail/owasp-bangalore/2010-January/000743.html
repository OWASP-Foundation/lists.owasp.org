<PRE>Hi all,

Greetings from null!
We thought it will be a good idea to get people to warm-up before
nullcon, so here is your chance to Win a free pass + two nights stay
at The Retreat. All you have to do is run over few trivial puzzles and
challenges and the prize is yours. In case you have already bought the
ticket don't worry we'll reimburse your ticket if you win.

Hacking Challenge: <A HREF="http://nullcon.net/challenge/">http://nullcon.net/challenge/</A>

Theme:
If you have spent anytime with puzzles like notpron or klueless, or
other hacking challenges, this one lies somewhere in between. (We
thought if you are going to pull your hair out solving the puzzle, its
only fair that you learn something while doing so.)

Rules:
Ok, here you should pay more attention:
1. Each level gives you sets of clues to reach to the next level.
Following these clues you should figure your way to the next level.
Once you have reached the final level you'll know how to claim the
booty.
2. Hints will be provided for each level through twitter or null
mailing list or nullcon.net website. More details will be available
shortly.
3. This challenge does NOT give participants any legal permission to
exploit <A HREF="http://nullcon.net">http://nullcon.net</A> or its hosting partner in a destructive
manner . Any attack against the site or the hosted servers will be
observed under general legal framework.

Tools:
1. Armed with your favorite hacking and debugging  tools is advisable.
(It will be a good idea to take the new Matriux or BT4 for a ride.)

Good Luck and Have fun :)
