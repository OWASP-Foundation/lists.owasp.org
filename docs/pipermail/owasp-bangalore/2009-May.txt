Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] This Month's Meet Has Been Canceled
Message-ID: <3ea7730b0905110631t713f3a40s1d722021b6263d83@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys,

This month's session is canceled due to some issues with the logistics.

We will meet up for the next session on 6-Jun-09.
Topic for the next session would be 'Iframe Injection' (by Praveen) and/or
'Turn your Firefox Into an Ultimate Hacking Tool - Part I' (by myself)..

We have not decided upon a venue for next session. Please do suggest if you
have any good place in your mind.

Thanks & Regards,
*Rajiv Vishwa*

Hey Hackers and BarCampers.

http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=QWsZc3LorUw BharatMatrimony. com Hack

Few days (months, it was Feb !)  back  i posted below E-mail,  that India's
Leading matrimonial website (not revealing the name it was
BharatMatriony. com !) having Security loophole, on their login page. !

BM has having 1.5 crore + members. (source Bharatmatrimony. com --> about
us). Finally uploading the Video (i have captured the videos when Site was
open with security loophole.)

BM has not approached since many days, nor they have taken care  to revert,
However more importantly seems like the reported issue is fixed, and i think
its good to put   "How it was done"

with hope you find it interesting, and may prevent such mistake in your
website. :)

Funny Enough, it was Valentine day, i was supposed to go to Y! hackday but
can't due to some time conflicts... .and
i was searching my (would be )life partner, but find bug :)   Poor Me :(

Cheers and Happy Hacking :)

Arun

Client applicaiton is Web/ Java based or VB based ?

 

You can run commerically avaialble Vulnerability scanning tools for
Windows-OS & web based applicaitons, and try to address the listed High/
Medium vulnreabilities.

 

For Winodws OS - ISS Scanner will do

For Web based applicaiton, both commerical and free ware tool is
avaialble.

 

Also Antivirus is a must.

 

Chandra can provide much more information.

 

regards

Murugan

Hi Folks,

 

I've been trying to find out ways of performing security assessment of
stand-alone windows-based client applications. But I couldn't get any
lead on that.

 

It would be of great help, if anyone in this distro has any knowledge or
prior experience in that area. Please throw some light on security
assessment of stand-alone client applications.

Regards,

R.Arun Sundaresh

First of all, let us try and understand what type of application. By "Client
Application", do you mean Desktop Application, in which case it changes the
way you approach security assessment in the first place.

Guys,

Venue still seems to be a big issue. This weekend i went around MG Road to
find a suitable place. There are couple of CCDs, Barista and Mocha; if
everybody in the group is ok with these places.

Thanks,

Couple of approaches

1. Start the application.
2. Start ollydbg/your favourite debugger
3. Attach the process.
4. See where all can you input data.
5. Automate entering of data using autohotkey or something like that.
6. If it crashes try this http://www.codeplex.com/msecdbg

Or

1. What does it use for IPC
2. Does it rely on a network socket.
3. Can you send data to that ?

Or maybe

1. Find out what it was written in.
2. Find a fuzzing tool for that

Hey recently a client wanted to know why would anyone refer to OWASP
for guidelines to securing their web apps. The question was in the
context of if the app is already ISO 27002 certified etc.

I created a simple one page PDF and shared with them. Might be useful
in your organisations as well.

Feedback more than welcome.

The information has been taken from various sources online and the
copyright only applies to presenting them in this manner. Feel free to
use them anywhere and if you do quote me great but its ok otherwise as
well. It was more for the client than anything else.

Akash - my 2 c, in addition to your document.
>From what I know an App cannot be certified to ISO 27001 because there is no
provision in the standard to certify an application for security.
The standard sets up the ISMS in the organization and will ask that
applications be secured and tested for security vulnerabilities. However it
does not go into the nitty gritty of application testing and this is left
for the organization to decide upon. If you see this is the case with Risk
Management, Asset Management etc in ISO 27k1 too.

So for your client to be asking why OWASP when ISO is there the answer is
that ISO is a standard for ISMS but OWASP is the framework to build / test
security in the application.

And thanks for the PDF - it gives some good industry references to the use
of the OWASP guidelines.

Good effort but to get it accurate, PCI DSS Version 1.2 is already out
(Oct1, 2008). The requirement is 6.5 is the one which talks on OWASP
specifically while 6.6 talks of manual application VA or WAF. 

 

Cheers,
Dharshan

Akash - my 2 c, in addition to your document.

 

>From what I know an App cannot be certified to ISO 27001 because there is no
provision in the standard to certify an application for security. 

 

The standard sets up the ISMS in the organization and will ask that
applications be secured and tested for security vulnerabilities. However it
does not go into the nitty gritty of application testing and this is left
for the organization to decide upon. If you see this is the case with Risk
Management, Asset Management etc in ISO 27k1 too.

 

So for your client to be asking why OWASP when ISO is there the answer is
that ISO is a standard for ISMS but OWASP is the framework to build / test
security in the application. 

 

And thanks for the PDF - it gives some good industry references to the use
of the OWASP guidelines.

Hey recently a client wanted to know why would anyone refer to OWASP
for guidelines to securing their web apps. The question was in the
context of if the app is already ISO 27002 certified etc.

I created a simple one page PDF and shared with them. Might be useful
in your organisations as well.

Feedback more than welcome.

The information has been taken from various sources online and the
copyright only applies to presenting them in this manner. Feel free to
use them anywhere and if you do quote me great but its ok otherwise as
well. It was more for the client than anything else.
