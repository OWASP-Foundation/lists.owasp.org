There is nothing to be surprised here. With not much control of the hosting
environment and shared hosting servers, these days one should be prepared
with such things whether it is a security consulting/training company or
a non-IT business line. There were many such cases including one where an
independent security researcher's website was hacked just before he was to
deliver a security talk at a conference, (I am not able to get that news
article at this time, some one could help). He gracefully accepted and
shared it in the conference.

What is expected from this firm but not showed is a professional approach to
the incident. They seem to have quickly recovered but no indication
of openness in declaring the defacement incident or accepting the risks
faced. A classic case of incident handling and analysis with true spirit of
openness is of the Apache XSS hack.
