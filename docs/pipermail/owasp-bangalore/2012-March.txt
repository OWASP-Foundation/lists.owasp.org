Any information from Bangalore, Raj?

As an aside, I am booked for the morning of April 18th to speak to
the Cloud Security Group at Wipro. ?Their Security Architects have
shown interest in learning about RC3.

Here is also one more piece of interesting information you might
want to share with the OWASP chapter:

-----
A free and open-source web-application - StrongKey CryptoCabinet -
was released today for General Availability. The CryptoCabinet is
built using the RC3 architecture and can be used to encrypt files
and store them in public or private clouds (or SAN/NAS devices)
while storing cryptographic keys securely outside the cloud on the
StrongAuth KeyAppliance. The CryptoCabinet uses the StrongKey
CryptoEngine (http://www.cryptoengine.org - also FOSS) for its
underlying cryptographic functions and cloud communications.

Details can be found at http://www.cryptocabinet.org.

Thanks.

AppSec Asia Pacific features two days of training April 11-12, followed by

Derry added, "In accordance with the broadening of OWASP's mission after
the 2011 OWASP Global Summit, AppSec APAC is extending its content beyond
the realm of web applications to include all aspects of web and application
security. We invite all practitioners of application security and those who
work with or interact with all facets of application security to submit
papers and participate in the conference."



OWASP AppSec APAC attracts a worldwide audience. Executives from Fortune
500 firms along with technical thought leaders such as security architects
and lead developers will be traveling to hear the cutting-edge ideas
presented by Information Security?s top talent. Past conferences have drawn
more than 800 technologists from Government, Financial Services, Media,
Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare, Technology, and many other verticals.



Sponsored by Fortify, Appsecure, Imperva, Ionize, Content Security Pty Ltd.
and Trustwave, AppSec APAC is hosted by the Open Web & Application Security
Project (OWASP), a 501c3 Not-For-Profit. OWASP is an open-source
application security project made up of corporations, educational

vendor-neutral, practical, cost-effective application security guidelines,
the organization has become the de facto standards body for application
security over the past decade.
