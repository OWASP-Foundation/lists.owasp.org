All,

Today's meeting went really well. We had a presentation by Sundar on "Access
Controls".

There is a change to the next meeting. We will not be meeting on the 4 Jan
and will be meeting at the same time and same venue on the 11 Jan.

The wiki is updated with all required information and the agenda for the
next meet.

Also, as a reminder, we have the presenters list at
http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pUR25ofggoYQAxXpNRsZ6Ng. Please
update a topic of your interest to present or if you would like to listen or
learn about something, please do update the list.

Regards,
Hari

ANNOUNCING THE NEW "OWASP TESTING GUIDE v3

OWASP is announcing the new OWASP Testing Guide v3. The project as
part of the OWASP Summer of Code, started on April 2008 reviewing the
version 2, improving it.
OWASP Testing Guide v3 is a 349 page book; we have split the set of
active tests in 9 sub-categories for a total of 66 controls to test
during the Web Application Testing activity.
Each control has an OWASP name, so for example a SQL Injection is
called: OWASP-DV-005, meaning that it is the 5th control of the Data
Validation category.
We got a dream team of 21 authors and 4 reviewers: after 6 months of
hard work and great team work we realized the v3.

We'd like to ask you to support OWASP to reach the following goals:

*** Continuously improve the guide.
The Guide is a "live" document: we always need your feedback!
Please join our testing mailing list and share your ideas:
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing

*** Promote the Testing Guide.
We would like to have some more media coverage on the guide, so
please, if you know somebody in there put them in touch.
If you have the chance, you can write an article about the Testing
Guide and the new OWASP Projects.
Also you can pick up the OWASP Testing Guide presentations and talk
about it in local conferences and Chapter meetings.
http://www.owasp.org/images/2/2c/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3.ppt

*** Add 'quotes' to the Guide.
We made a special 'quotes' pages for the Testing Guide.
Here we'd want to add all the comments and references to the Guide.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_Quotes

The OWASP Testing Guide includes a "best practice" penetration testing
framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a
"low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for
testing most common web application and web service security issues.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Exploit-Me: a suite of Firefox web application
	security testing tool
In-Reply-To: <96d915ba0812180142y763a5f20h90ffecf87cbca3dc@mail.gmail.com>
References: <96d915ba0812180142y763a5f20h90ffecf87cbca3dc@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <96d915ba0812180142r249e0324o756be0bf4a8ea987@mail.gmail.com>

Not sure, if people on this list are already aware of this tool for firefox.
Please see http://www.securitycompass.com/exploitme.shtml Source code can
also downloaded from their website.

*XSS-Me*
 <http://www.securitycompass.com/exploit_me/xssme/xssme_faq.shtml>

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common flaw found in todays web
applications. XSS flaws can cause serious damage to a web application.
Detecting XSS vulnerabilities early in the development process will help
protect a web application from unnecessary flaws. XSS-Me is the Exploit-Me
tool used to test for reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

*SQL Inject-Me*
 <http://www.securitycompass.com/exploit_me/sqlime/sqlime_faq.shtml>

SQL Injection vulnerabilites can cause a lot of damage to a web application.
A malicious user can possibly view records, delete records, drop tables or
gain access to your server. SQL Inject-Me is the Exploit-Me tool used to
test for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.


*Access-Me*
 <http://www.securitycompass.com/exploit_me/accessme/accessme_faq.shtml>

Access vulnerabilites in an application can allow an attacker to access
resources without being authenticated. Access-Me is the Exploit-Me tool used
to test for Access vulnerabilities.
Cheers,
-Sumit

Hello Sumit,

Good list of tools.

However on a sad note, Access Me does not work on Firefox v3.0.5 (Latest)

Wish they release new update soon.

Guys,

For some reason, my new year plans are off for now. I'll be in Bangalore
only so thought to check if 4th Jan sounds good for everybody. I know Hari
is out of station but he won't be back until Jan end. Here is the link to
the event http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1456819 , please respond whether
you will be able to attend or not on the 4th. I will replan (keep it to 11th
Jan only) in case most of us are busy on 4th.

Wishes,
-Sumit

11th jan would be better.....
it's is long weekend for most of us extending upto 4th jan.....
most people return back on 4th.....so it might be difficult to attend OWASP
meeting on the same day.

regads,

Guys,

So far i've received only one opposition on 4th Jan; so i'm counting that
4th Jan is on! Please respond to the mail itself in case the upcoming link
is not opening for whatever reasons (firewall etc). Anybody has Amit's phone
number? Haven't heard from him. Following guys confirmed their participation
on 4th: Sundar, Sharmishtha, Rohit, Aman, Somebody with id(v_jn), TRG

Thanks,
-Sumit

Hi Every one,
According to the responses received,
guess most of us are fine with 4th Jan .
I guess we could go ahead to have the
Meet on 4th Jan 2009.
So lets start a secure new year.
And wish all a great new year ahead in advance..

Sundar.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] January Meet on 11th Jan only
Message-ID: <96d915ba0812310326t3aa8f2b0k7c238c7ae582b953@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

Considering that people are showing interest in 11th Jan and others have not
objected on it, lets meet on 11th only so as to have more participants. I
hope those who strongly came forward for 11th will be present for sure.

With wishes for a "safe and secure" new year.
-Sumit
