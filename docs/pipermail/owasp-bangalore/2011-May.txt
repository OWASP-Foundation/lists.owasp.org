Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Skype IM (MAC OS X) - Is this the 0day ?
Message-ID: <BANLkTinUUtkOYMkqLCHgCzNCPiXa8uYZaw@mail.gmail.com>

*Skype IM (MAC OS X) - Is this the 0day ?
*
Recently, we have came across about the news on SKYPE 0
DAY<http://www.purehacking.com/blogs/gordon-maddern/skype-0day-vulnerabilitiy-discovered-by-pure-hacking>that
results in remote exploitation on MAC OS. However, we have also
discovered the same pattern of vulnerability in Skype two months ago. Due to
testing reasons, we were not indulged in the process of reporting it to
vendor because we were looking at the malware paradigm related to this
vulnerability(whether it can be exploited to download malware in MAC OSX).

More Info:

Now that Microsoft has acquired skype,  these 0 days makes sense.....may be
more on their way....pun intended :)
