Hi All,

Was looking for Qualys Vulnerability Scanner but was not getting clear
understanding about it's working, I mean it's deployment structure and
how Scan servers (if any), SOC, Scanning Agent are aligned from
architecture perspective. Also, what is the purpose of it's physical
and Virtual appliances from deployment perspective and how in actual
it works for scanning external and internal IPs.

Hi Anuvrat,

Qualys has deployed scanner on cloud based environment. As per my
experience they will not provide any binary to install in our machines. For
external (Internet facing) applications/infrastructures we can use cloud
based system by using the URL : http://www.qualys.com or
https://qualysguard.qualys.com/ (Register for free trial). If you need to
scan internal perimeter you can contact Qualys team to install their
virtual appliances in your perimeter and then you can scan.

Hope this helps you, please let me know if more details are required.

Best Regards,
Deepak
