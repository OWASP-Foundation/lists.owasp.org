Subject: IT Security certification training - Certified Ethical Hacker
 
Dear Mr. Pudipeddi,

IntelleSecure is pleased to inform you that we will conduct a training
program for the &quot;Certified Ethical Hacker&quot; certification offered by the
EC-Council this month. In May, we will conduct a Workshop on the Sarbanes
Oxley Act, Web Application Security &amp; in June we will conduct our next
Workshop for CISSP aspirants.
 
We would be much obliged if you could forward this information to your
friends and colleagues who would be interested in these certifications.
Thank you!

Our five-day Certified Ethical Hacker training program aims to enable each
participant to identify and correct exploits that make information systems
vulnerable to attack. We focus on providing the skills required to obtain
the CEH certification which will serve as a significant step in your career
development as an information security professional. Each participant will
work on the latest techniques and tools for penetration testing because the
best way to protect an organization from hackers is to be an expert ethical
hacker. The Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures course prepares candidates
for the CEH exam. The course focuses on hacking techniques and technology
from a defensive perspective. This class will immerse the student into an
interactive environment where they will be shown how to scan, test, hack and
secure their own systems. The lab-intensive environment gives each student
in-depth knowledge and practical experience with current security systems
and technologies. Participants will understand how hackers attack and
exploit the vulnerabilities of a system, expose system weaknesses and
uncover unknown vulnerabilities. They will learn to implement
countermeasures to secure all of these.

Please refer to the attached document that contains:

   1. A detailed course description
   2. The list of domains covered during the program
   3. Details regarding the facilitator for the workshop - Kishin Fatnani
(CISSP, CEH, SANS GIAC Certified Incident Handling Analyst (GCIH) Gold &amp;
Forensic 
       Analyst (GCFA), Check Point Certified Security Expert (CCSE), ISS
Certified Architect (ISS-CA)).
   4. The eligibility requirement, schedule, course fee and registration
process.
 
To register/nominate your colleagues, please contact the undersigned. We
urge you to confirm your participation at the earliest since the number of
participants is limited to 12. If further information is required, please
