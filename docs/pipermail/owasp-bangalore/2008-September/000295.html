Dear Mr. Harinath Pudipeddi,



Hope this email finds you well.



We at Ostfold Software would like to meet with your core teams to discuss
about how can help you by setting up a Secure Coding lab with best practices
to write secure web come. We have just come from the OWASP conference in
Delhi and we have had great reviews and interest from the Indian Developer /
QA / Application Security community. We would like to extend your interest
in learning more about our solutions, Armorize CodeSecure and Armorize
HackAlert, by giving out some online trial accounts.



We would also like meet with the core teams interested in securing your web
applications effectively and give a demonstration at your convenient time.
Different teams within your organization can benefit as follows:



*Development Teams:*

   - Write and deliver *secure code*.
   - Get Security vulnerabilities *fix recommendations* based on the
   language.
   - Integrated *performance dashboards* help get visibility into the entire
   vulnerability assessment of the project.
   - Understand how* hackers turn a vulnerability into a hack *through trace
   back and detailed explanations.
   - Write code in *compliance* to top standards such as PCI, OWASP, SOX,
   etc.
   - Enterprise interface and *IDE-integration* ensure that vulnerabilities
   are identified, understood and remedied with minimal cost and impact on
   project progress.
   - Better *coordination between different application groups *as the trace
   back pin points root cause of vulnerabilities.

*QA Teams**:*

   - *Vulnerability assessment* through automated Source Code Analysis (SAC)
   with very little configuration.
   - Assistance in *bridging the gap* between developers and IS teams.
   - Ensure that code *delivered is secure* and allows IS teams
   to.concentrate on Network / Infrastructure vulnerabilities.
   - Understand how* hackers turn a vulnerability into a hack *through trace
   back and detailed explanations.

 *IS and Audits teams :*

   - Report *less vulnerabilities at the application layer* thus reducing
   costs as most vulnerabilities are reported at the development stage.
   - Better *coordination between different application groups *as the trace
   back pin points root cause of vulnerabilities.
   - *Vulnerability assessment* through automated Source Code Analysis (SAC)
   with very little configuration.
   - Integrated *performance dashboards* help get visibility into the entire
   vulnerability assessment of the project.

 Kindly send this mail across to all managers within Development, QA and IS
teams so that we can arrange for demos and online trials for interested
people.



*Do reply back with the names and email addresses of the interested people
to evaluate the solutions*. The benefits of the solutions are given below.



Looking forward a to a reply at the earliest.
