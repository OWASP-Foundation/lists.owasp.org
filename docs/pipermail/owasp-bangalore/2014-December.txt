Message-ID: <CA+QUGmNSpWGugF62c1tBCv6Oz+BexZN3v6NZDmxzKdojRuWbnw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

At the moment we are sorry to announce that we will not be conducting the
XWH session planned on 14th of December.

Our session trainer Mr. Riyaz is busy with other things and will not be
able to give his time.

We will let you know if we do the session via the mailing list.

Thank you.

Recently someone asked about .net security related question.

I refer to the following time and again. Might be useful for the list.

All the resources are free and open source under very liberal licensing, so
even companies can peruse this without any legal implications.

   3. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_.NET_Project
   4. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASP.NET_Misconfigurations


Please do share your favourite resources or discuss about these.

Hi Rohit and others,

Please start with this guide.

The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must
Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)
http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html


Then move to
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Canonicalization,_locale_and_Unicode

More reading is here

http://stackoverflow.com/a/222424

Also a newer article I haven't read so far but looks very good.
What every programmer absolutely, positively needs to know about encodings
and character sets to work with text

Hi Sherin,

There is nothing stopping you from doing that. But usually this job
requires an Incident Responder. Someone who can go through web server logs
to understand the attack point etc.

Hey folks,

Please find the slides for todays demo session.

http://www.slideshare.net/anantshri/owasp-bangalore-owtf-demo-13-dec-2014

as the crux of the presentation was in the demo and we can't really do a
demo on slides
hence i have embedded a video which OWTF team created as part of Brucon
showcasing the ability of OWTF in Demo section.

hope that will help.

Feel free to voice in your queries to me or @7a_ and we will be happy to
help.

Hi Sherin,

We do have a logo now. It is on the wiki page.

Shruthi was kind enough to make one for us. :)
