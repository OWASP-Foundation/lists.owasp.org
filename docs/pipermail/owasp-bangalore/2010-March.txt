	Challenge
Message-ID: <b8546451-610c-45e4-8175-53c45ea2e3c6@c37g2000prb.googlegroups.com>

The Department of Homeland Security is working with many
organizations, both individually and through the National Cyber
Security Alliance, to find ways of raising public awareness of
cybersecurity. As we develop strategies and messages that will
resonate with various groups, we want the benefit of your ideas on how
you would get the word out to your colleagues, or your friends, or
your parents and children. This competition will gather and share
publicly the best, most creative ideas for making the public more
cyber secure, cyber smart, and cyber assured.

The Challenge

The National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Challenge Competition is
designed to solicit ideas from industry and individuals alike on how
best we can clearly and comprehensively discuss cybersecurity with the
American public.

Key areas that should be factored into the competition are the
following:

    * Teamwork
    * Ability to quantify the distribution method
    * Ability to quantify the receipt of message
    * Solution may under no circumstance create spam
    * Use of Web 2.0 Technology
    * Feedback mechanism
    * List building
    * Privacy protection
    * Repeatability
    * Transparency
    * Message

It should engage the Private Sector and Industry leaders to develop
their own campaign strategy and metrics to track how to get a unified
cyber security message out to the American public.

Proposals should be submitted in Word format by April 30, 2010 and
should include the following:

    * Company name, Point of Contact and contact information
    * Outline of Campaign Strategy
          o Strategic overview of plan and definition of success
          o Organizations involved
          o Target audience
          o Timeline
          o Metrics used to define success.
    * Distribution of Message
          o Communication methods to reach targeted audience
                + Traditional media/PSAs
                + New Media
                + Literature/Pamphlets

Winners of the Challenge will be invited to an event in Washington
D.C. in late May or early June.  Winners will partner with the
Department to lead in the planning of the National Cybersecurity
Awareness Campaign and to ready the campaign for its launch during
Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.

I think we had a wonderful meet this time & i suppose each one of 30+ audience went out from the room with a sense of learning & accomplishment.?

Overall it was a day worth attending and we will remember those 3 hours
 & 45mins for long time. Please find the ppt from my session attached(ofcourse without Pamela), i will be working more on it and will send the further updates soon. On Popular demand also find Anish's colourful presentation attached.Tamaghna & Manju will be sending their ppts soon.

Message-ID: <c1e982c51003230806v74c07432nc1e31a83cfe2945c@mail.gmail.com>

Durex condom orders leak on web

Remember the Astroglide<http://archive.pogowasright.org/article.php?story=20070421094259854>
breach <http://archive.pogowasright.org/article.php?story=20070423173959506>,
when customers who ordered samples of the lubricant had their personal
details exposed online? Now there are allegations that Durex condom orders
were leaking on the web.

Last week, this site [databreaches.net <http://www.databreaches.net/>]
received a lead about a security problem involving the web site of a Durex
product. On March 5, a customer reportedly discovered that anyone could view
his and other customers? orders on the kohinoorpassion.com web site by
simply inserting a different order ID number in the url without any login
required. Names, addresses, phone numbers, and type of products ordered were
all there for ready viewing. The orders had not been placed on the
kohninoorpassion.com web site, but on the Durex India e-store
site<http://www.durexindia.com/estore>.


>From what the customer could determine, the earliest order exposed online
dated back to February 23, 2009, but there is no confirmation as to for how
long the customer records might have been accessible without a login.
According to the customer?s web site about the breach, no credit card or
financial data were exposed.

The customer reported that he promptly contacted TTK-LIG (the marketer of
the Durex brand in India and manufacturer of Kohinoor condoms) and SSL
International (the owner of the Durex brand worldwide) about the problem and
that by the next day, the site appeared to be better secured. But that
wasn?t the end of the story, it seems. The customer created his own web site
and FAQ about the breach
<http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/home>and has been
updating it since then. A review of the updates suggest that
things took an ugly turn within a matter of weeks.

It started cordially enough. By email on March 6, TTK-LIG thanked the
customer for alerting them to the problem, and indicated that they would be
sending him a gift hamper by courier and SSL International also reportedly
responded to the customer. Neither indicated that they would be notifying
any customers of the exposure, however, which was less than satisfactory to
the customer.

On March 18, the lawyers appeared. TTK-LIG?s attorneys allegedly sent a
threat letter to the customer, reproduced
here<http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/updates/07legalnoticefromttk-liglimited>.
It said, in part:

5. During their on-going investigations, our client discovered to their
shock from their records that, between the time of intimation to our client
on March 5, 2010 at around 1.40 pm India time and the subsequent remedial
actions to provide full security to our client?s website on 5th March 2010
at around 11:40 pm India time, you have unauthorisedly downloaded 3,906
order details relating to 2,753 customers, who have transacted with our
client through their e-store. You had no business or any authority to
download and / or copy the personal information relating to other customers
and deal with the same, in breach of the terms of the user of the said
e-store or otherwise and you have breached the confidentiality of the other
customers. Your action breaches the terms of the user of the said e-store.
Such misuse of our client?s website constitutes, among others, an offence
punishable under the Information Technology Act read with the provisions of
Indian Penal Code.

6. We on behalf of our client state that the civil and criminal wrong
already committed by you under the pretext of discovering a so-called ?data
breach? in our client?s websites, has stood aggravated by your further acts
which include the following:

i. Creation of a website which has the effect of falsely instilling a sense
of alarm in the minds of our client?s customers and posting various comments
therein;

ii. Contacting various customers of our client on the basis of information
unauthorisedly extracted by you from our client?s website and thereby
inter-alia infringing their privacy. In this regard, our client wishes to
add that at least five customers have written to our client in this matter
after being alerted by an email generated from the email address
durexwhistleblower at gmail.com.

[...]

The letter concluded with the typical lawyerly demands.

On March 19, the customer says that he
replied<http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/updates/08responsetolegalnotice>,
in part:

5. Kindly note that unless you are either able to appropriately substantiate
your allegations or I receive a full retraction of all allegations made
against me in your note and an unconditional apology from your client within
24 hours of your receipt of this letter via email or at any rate by 10 am on
March 21, 2010, I fully intend to (i) commence legal proceedings against
your client for serious breach of my privacy and gross negligence with data
received in connection with a purchase I made from your client of an
intensely personal nature, and (ii) to widely publicise the contents of your
legal notice and related information in my possession in the public interest
and exercising my rights to protected free speech.

Both the lawyers? deadline and the customer?s deadline came and went. E-mail
inquiries sent to both TTK-LIG and SSL International on Saturday were not
answered by the time of this publication.
