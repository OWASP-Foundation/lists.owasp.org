  Hi,

I received a Phishing Mail. Feel like reporting the same to you as I found
it's a risk to the respective banker users. Please do the needful. I am
forwaring the received mail below along with the header information.

I tried accessing the below URL and found that it's phishing site which
simulates the ICICI Bank. * *

http://artinfusion.com/images/onlineverification/index.html ... Attached the
page.

Here is the host details, in my initial study.


*Host of the IP:*

artinfusion.com [Whois]

*IP country code:*

*IP address country:*

*IP address state:*

*IP address city:*

*IP postcode:*

*IP address latitude:*

*ISP of this IP [? <http://www.ip-adress.com/isp>]:*

*Organization:*

*Local time in United States:*

I believe atleast 1% of the users will get trapped into these phishing sites
even enough education happening from banker.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimGQHVd-8t53HaPTFYszay6fgERhLVIJLiN8oxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings from null!

We are proud to announce the launch of our latest project: n|u Jobs
n|u Jobs a.k.a null security jobs is an initiative by null - The open
security community. The aim of the project is to aid and boost
employment in the field of information security. The job posters
and seekers both can post/apply for jobs online and are not
charged anything for using the service.

Website: http://jobs.nullcon.net
Email: jobs_a t_null.co.in
Working for Peanuts? Working under Hari Sadu? Logon to jobs.null.co.in
Today :-)

About null
null is an open community and a non-profit initiative with the aim of
bringing together the best minds in the information security field and
work on innovative solutions to counter current an emerging threats.
It is also a forum to freely discuss and responsibly disclose security
vulnerabilities via project Keeda.


What is null Keeda Project?
Keeda Project is a database of vulnerabilities reported by the
security community at large to null. The aim of Keeda project is to
inform the vendors and govt about any vulnerabilities found in the
wild and reported to us to enable the organizations respond to that
security threat quickly and fix it before crackers can steal
confidential data or infect their systems. Keeda is a free service and
we don't charge anything to the vendors. Although a Thank you note for
the person who reported the vulnerability and Keeda would encourage
more people to report vulnerabilities to us (eventually to you
privately) instead of disclosing them in public which can harm any
organization's business reputation.

Email: keeda_a t_null.co.in
Contact us if you have found any vulns (and also if the vendors are
not responding).

0 days or known - Our priority is based on it's "reported to Vendor" status.

Both i.e. products as well as custom software ( custom web apps for example).

It's totally your decision and no we don't possess any super
natural/voodoo skills :-).
Although we can try to speed up the process or make noise about it in
front of the right people.

> Site Specific, Isn't that illegal and lame in the first place?

Our reports directly go to CERT-IN and the vendors.
Illegal - I don't think so, lame - may be :-).

Hope that answers your queries. let me know if you have any further queries.

Subject: [Owasp-leaders] OWASP Testing Guide v4: start-up
To: owasp-testing <owasp-testing at lists.owasp.org>, Owasp leaders <
owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>


Hi all,
thanks to the OWASP Foundation, it's time to start-up with a new OWASP
Testing Guide project!

Introduction and Project purpose for v4:
============================
The OWASP Testing Guide v3 includes a "best practice" penetration
testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations
and a "low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques
for testing most common web application and web service security
issues. Nowadays the Testing Guide has become the standard to perform
a Web Application Penetration Testing and many Companies all around
the world have adopted it.
It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that
represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

Project Roadmap
=============
- 1st phase: Brainstorming
18th July 2010: starting a brainstorming with the OWASP Leaders and
project contributors to share goals and project's objectives.
The following are the main improvements we have to realize:
- Inserting new testing techniques, OWASP Top10 update: HTTP Verb
tampering, HTTP Parameter Pollutions, URL Redirection, Insecure Direct
Object References, Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Failure to Restrict
URL Access, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection, Unvalidated
Redirects and Forwards.
- Review and improve all the sections in v3,
- Create a more readable guide, eliminating some sections that are not
really useful, Rationalize some sections as Session Management
Testing,
- Create a new section: Client side security and Firefox extensions testing.
- Create a test case for each test to perform using O2 platform

- 2nd phase: Set-up the team
15th August: Introduce the new project to the OWASP mailing list
seeking for contributors. We need to involve also the final users of
the Testing Guide (for example Banking Companies to understand how
they would like to improve that).

- 3rd phase: Create a new Index
15th September: creating a new table of contents of the OTGv4
assigning a task for each contributor.
Here is the v3 Index:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents

- 4th phase:  Writing and reviewing
1st October 2010: Starting writing
1st November 2010:Starting the first review phase,
15th November 2010: Starting writing articles II phase,
1st December 2010: Starting the second review phase,
15th December 2010: Create the RC1,
15th January 2011: Release the version 4.

1st phase
=======
Now, we are at the 1st phase, and I think this phase it's the most
important to create a solid project as we saw from the last versions.
This time I found really important to open a debate about the following
item.

- OWASP vulnerabilities -
The OWASP Testing Guide checklist represents the set of controls to
test: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist
We divided it into 10 categories (Information Gath, Config. Mng,
Authentication, etc...). For each category we tell what test to
perfom.
The last column tells you what vulnerability you can find if the test
demonstrate a weakness of the application.
Now I see that the list of vulnerabilities is not alligned with all
the OWASP Guides.
Imo the point is that is foundamental to create a list of OWASP
Vulnerabilities shared between the OWASP projects. Why?
Because the OWASP DevGuide, Code Review and Testing Guide should be
linked to this common KB: in this way the 3 projects are linked
between the others and Companies can uderstand for each vuln how to
protect from this vuln (Dev), how to review that code (CR), and how to
test the app running (TG). Then because it is very important for the
Companies have a full list of the possible WebAppSec vulns (I think
there is a lack now).

At this time we have: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability
But this list does not represents what I mean.
I would like to start from the OWASP Testing Guide checklist and
collect all the vulnerabiities we can find from the last column, add
the new ones. Then maybe Eoin's team should add the white box
vulnerabilities: we know some are the same of the black box
assessment, but others can be found only perfoming a Code Review, for
example "Backdoor in the code". Then the Dev Guide team should point
to this set of vulnerabilities telling how to write code to protect
the application for each vulnerability.

What do you think about that?

Thanks,
Mat

Hey

Anyone is having top level contacts can forward it ? Its home page is open.
i found this from linkedin, and but none keen to listen.

As it is still open, i dont think it is wise to publish details, however you
can try its very easy, just 2min it will take.

There are tons and tons of websites vulnerable.

If people don't care, what is the point making ruckus about it on the group.
Its a decision they are taking - "not to fix". As long as someone is
understanding the risk and ready to live with that risk, its good
enough :)

Folks ,

Why don't we make a website and publish them .
I mean not the flaws , just that some website has so and so problem .
I know bad guys would try to exploit it , but atleast it would bring
pressure on the website owners to close those holes .

It's not actually.
If end-users are in trouble due to  administrator's negligence, it's discretionary to disclose. That's the essence of full-disclosure.
In any case, Raxit's been fairly responsible by not disclosing the details yet.

Hi,

I am just following this mail thread. But could not able to get that to whom
this information has been passed in that organisation.
Is he/she the right person to whom we have passed the message and in general
regular IT people may not understand the implications of it until unless
some one explain them what exact wrong happens and how vulnerable they are.

In today's news paper there was a message about the FaceBook database hack.
At the same time owners of the same mentioned to the public that any way the
information which ever is hacked from the DB is already public information.
May be background they are working on the same.

In this context, I have an idea.I have this from long time but didn't
execute this in full strength.

Some of the security folks has to gather together. May be even from OWASP
Bangalore Chapter. Openly telling we can not stop all the attackers and at
the same time we can not go and inform each and every vulnerable site
owner. We need to plan for different types of public information security
awareness programs in a non-commercial mode. As of now, In my mind I thought
we need to have 3 different types of awareness program:
1. General Public community who all exposed to computers and computer based
transactions. This will make awareness to them in the context of "what all
attacks can happen and how much attention and care can be taken by
individual". This will go more over in non-technical terms.
2. Developers and the web site owners etc.. This will have a deeper level of
awareness what all the different attacks and how to handle them using
different open source program and why to handle them.
3. Student. This is more over like No.2. But the main objective of this
community is to create motivation towards this security and getting the
force to re-create the same when they enter into the IT industry.

I know this requires commitment and some background work. If minimum of 5-6
people are interested we can put initial things together and work on it.

As of now, please provide some comments with your experience about these
sort of awareness programs. Based on the comments we can start a mail thread
to discuss on this topic. :-)

Vinod Duggirala
