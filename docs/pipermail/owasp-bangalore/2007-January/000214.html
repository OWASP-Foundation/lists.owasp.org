<PRE>
Season's greetings to OWASP Community in Bangalore.  I noticed that not
much activity is going within this list in Bangalore.  It would be
interesting to have some threads of discussions on the Bangalore
community.  For starters , it would be interesting to see whether there
are any metrics on the Appsecurity testing segment. Metrics categorized
on the typical owasp guide lines for different types of applications.
Would anyone be aware of this ?

 

Regards

Sai Lakshmi
