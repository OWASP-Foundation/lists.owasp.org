Hi All,

I have been wanting to attend one of these meets since a long time. However,
not been able to do it so far. One of the reasons being the time of the
meet. This is quite early for a Sunday morning for me :-). Can we schedule
this at 11am?

Best regards,
Prathap

Prathap,

Early morning helps people meet their other engagements; besides early
morning means least traffic in Bangalore. Considering the benefits, we would
like to continue this schedule only. Once a month should not be a big issue,
right? If you wish, one of us will wake you up in the morning ;-)

Wishes,
-Sumit

Pratap,

This has been debated a lot of time. The reason we chose this time is to
ensure everyone has their holiday. Also, the traffic is less and parking is
easy to get. Also, we wind up by 10:30 or so and people can be back home
early.

Please try to make it by 9 AM.

Hari

Hi Guys,

So this week's session is 'Turning Firefox into Ultimate Hacking Tool (Part
I)'. This will be taken in series and this week it will be an intro session.


Make sure that you reach at 9.00AM, since the presenter (me [?]) has some
other program at 10AM, he has to finish the OWASP session as quick as
possible.

Regards
*Rajiv*

so dangerous. It will be useful to you as it contains some measures to
secure against the worm. Please read it at
http://citadelnotes.blogspot.comand spread the word because this is an

 Thanks to Rajiv for the wonderful session & Abhay to add on to it.
I Guess Abhay is covered most of the talk in his blog ,
which leaves very little to minute the meet.
Neways looking forward for the next meet in July.

Regards,
Sundar.

Thanks all. It was a nice meeting, although the locale could've been better
(I am working on a better location for the next one). Thanks, Rajiv for
sharing the info on the addons. I was planning to do a talk on
"Multi-tasking Web Application Malware - A dish best served cold!" for the
next meeting. I have been doing some research on the subject and thought I
would share it with the OWASP circle in Blore.

Cheers
Abhay

Just to add to this. Have a look at FireCat

http://www.security-database.com/toolswatch/+-FireCAT-+.html

This is based on a technical paper called "Turning Firefox to an
ethical hacking platform"

Hi All,
i have been working on Appsec domain for past 3.5 yrs, i have been following this mailing list for sometime now. i have a sincere request to consider the timings of the meeting. think from perspective of people working in Elec city or ITPL, they need to get up by 6 am? to reach office in time by 8 am everday.
To be at venue for OWASP meet by 9 we need to get up at 7-7.30 am. if we want community to grow and people to particiapte then we need to be considerate. 
?i would suggest if we can have a poll on the timings of the meet and then decide the timings for the future meets, by the way its just not my views, i read similar request earlier also.

Regards
Prashant

the timing.

We are ready to do a poll. Just to give you the statistics, there are more
than 300 in the mailing list and unfortunately not more than 10 turn up for
the meetings.

May I suggest something? For once, if you can take the initiative of coming

Adding to Hari`s thought :
Its easier to find parking early Sunday morning and by around 10.30  we are
done .
Hence we have the whole of Sunday at our disposal after this. Am sure all of
us
would want to more of weekend time for various reasons.These are just my
thoughts ,
however every one is free to raise their opinion :)

Sundar.

I suggest we create an online survey so that we have maximum participation.

 

Harinath - Just to add, I have people using free service of surveymonkey.com
in the past. You may want to try it. Let me know if you need any help.

 

Thanks,
Dharshan

To be at venue for OWASP meet by 9 we need to get up at 7-7.30 am. if we

I have planned many times to attend the meeting but i could not make it
there just it being early sunday morning. I think meeting a bit late , say
around 11.00 AM will be much more suitable.

May be you can try it for next months meet and still, if people don;t turn
up, you can go back to 9.00 AM schedule.

Hi,

I think you are missing Hari's point.

I was a part of OWASP Bangalore when the decision to carry out meetings 
at 9 am on Sunday mornings was taken after several debates and 
discussions. Although I am no more in Bangalore, I still believe (from 
previous experiences) that the current meeting schedule is what best 
suits everyone.... and that's exactly where the problem lies. People who 
are SURE to be regular attendees should be the ones allowed to cast 
their votes. Hence online survey may not give the correct picture.

(Okay, "allowed" is quite a strong word, but you get the idea. Right? :) )

Regards,
Bipin Upadhyay.

Lets have a vote the next meet with the people who turn up .
Does not make sense to count people who do not turn up.
Atleast we can be sure of people who are genuinely willing
to be part meets

Sundar.

I was discussing with Hari and I feel that we will go by the poll for the
immediate next meeting. If the response is poor, we will revert to the
previous timeslot. I think it is fair for those who have been attending and
for those who want to genuinely attend as well.

Regards
Abhay

Why would you send a doc file attachment, instead of just copy-pasting

Hi.

I'm looking for help (tuts, papers, comments etc) related to using
whitelists for protection against XSS.  I need to help some UI developers
implement whitelists in a java (JSP) project.  Any help from the community
will be appreciated. I'm sure this discussion will also profit others.

I saw somewhere that everything that goes out of hte server should be HTML
encoded (no white listing). So the special meaning of all the non alpha
numerics are masked. Any comments on this?

for example...a search string that contains XSS characters '<script' will be
converted to &#60;script.
The browser when reading the encoded chars will not interpret the special
meaning of '<' it will be displayed as '<' ie. there is no double decoding.

Yes basically that is how it is supposed to work. But there are
different languages, character sets

< in one charset might be something else in another char set. This
also differs a lot based on different browsers. Behaviour in IE6/FF3.1
etc. can be different.

Which is why white listing makes sense. But is more effective when
introduced as part of the whole software development life cycle. The
link i have mentioned has many examples for this.

 Does that total encoding solution i mentioned have any drawbacks? because
it seems to be a simple solution but not many use it.

Encoding HTML entities is an effective defence against XSS. But that
is for output. White listing is meant to be used while taking input
for an app.

Refer to the OWASP page on this
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A1

HTML encoding makes a lot of sense, when (as Akash mentioned) the 
character-set usage is proper.

For example, in UTF-7, "+ADw-" implies "<" and "+AD4-" implies ">". 
Search for Google UTF-7 XSS Vulnerability. It'll make things a bit more 
clear.

Oh ok that explains my main doubts .... Thanks.. The link echos what u said
here..Input has to be validated and output has to be encoded....
But XSS is executed only at the client (browser)...so why take the pain of
filtering the input ...for all you know those characters may mean something
useful to the application itself.

Dear all,
?There appears to be some confusion as to why?I sent the message to the mailing list?with an attachment.
?I had myself received it from another source,and saved the message,in my reference files,before sending it to this group.
?I am sending the file again,this time as a 'cut and paste' ,below
?
The newest virus circulating is the UPS/Fed Ex
Delivery Failure. You will
receive an email from UPS/Fed Ex Service along with a
packet number.. It will
say that they were unable to deliver a package sent to you
on such-and-such a
date. It then asks you to print out the invoice copy
attached. 
DON'T TRY TO PRINT THIS. IT LAUNCHES THE VIRUS! 
Pass this warning on to all your PC operators
at work and home. This virus has caused Millions of
dollars in damage in the
past few days.

?Snopes confirms that it is real.

That is why the application has to be developed, keeping in mind the inputs
and their contents. Although XSS seems like an innocuous client side attack,
it is an attack usually aimed by one user of the application against another
user of the same web application. XSS (especially persistent) can result in
anything from a Denial of Service (a la Samy worm for Myspace) to a stealing
of session credentials (the introduction to XSRF) and in some cases even
launching an attack against another website without the user's knowledge
(XSS proxy). It is quite a serious issue, to be given enough respect.

Simple answer: Understand the application, understand its input and encoding
requirements and users (attacks may be also using foreign characters) and
then develop a whitelist.

Abhay

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Help with whitelists for protection against
	XSS
References: <mailman.3.1244649602.4161.owasp-bangalore@lists.owasp.org>
Message-ID: <1D2CAFE5C009A4448FDEA321F108F3B256E7B1@MPBABTPEX01.corp.mphasis.com>


Best approach to validate is to accept only "Known Good" characters, i.e. the characters that are to be expected. If this cannot be done the next strongest strategy is "Known bad", where we reject all known bad characters. The issue with this is that today's known bad list may expand tomorrow as new technologies are added to the enterprise infrastructure. 

There are a number of models to think about when designing a data validation strategy, which are listed from the strongest to the weakest as follows. 

1.Exact Match (Constrain) 
2.Known Good (Accept) 
3.Reject Known bad (Reject) 
4.Encode Known bad (Sanitise) 

In addition, there must be a check for maximum length of any input received from an external source, such as a downstream service/computer or a user at a web browser. 

Rejected Data must not be persisted to the data store unless it is sanitized. This is a common mistake to log erroneous data, but that may be what the attacker wishes your application to do. 

1.Exact Match: (preferred method) 

Only accept values from a finite list of known values. 
e.g.: A Radio button component on a Web page has 3 settings (A, B, C). Only one of those three settings must be accepted (A or B or C). Any other value must be rejected. 


2.Known Good: 

If we do not have a finite list of all the possible values that can be entered into the system, we use the known good approach. 
e.g.: an email address, we know it shall contain one and only one @. It may also have one or more full stops ".". The rest of the information can be anything from [a-z] or [A-Z] or [0-9] and some other characters such as "_ "or "-", so we let these ranges in and define a maximum length for the address. 


3. Reject Known bad: 

We have a list of known bad values we do not wish to be entered into the system. This occurs on freeform text areas and areas where a user may write a note. The weakness of this model is that today known bad may not be sufficient for tomorrow. 


4. Encode Known Bad:

This is the weakest approach. This approach accepts all input but HTML encodes any characters within a certain character range. HTML encoding is done so if the input needs to be redisplayed the browser shall not interpret the text as script, but the text looks the same as what the user originally typed. 



5.HTML-encoding and URL-encoding user input when writing back to the client.

In this case, the assumption is that no input is treated as HTML and all output is written back in a protected form. This is sanitisation in action.




Also,Stinger (www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Stinger_Project) and ESAPI (www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI ) can be of good help.

Dear all,
?There appears to be some confusion as to why?I sent the message to the mailing list?with an attachment.
?I had myself received it from another source,and saved the message,in my reference files,before sending it to this group.
?I am sending the file again,this time as a 'cut and paste' ,below
?
The newest virus circulating is the UPS/Fed Ex
Delivery Failure. You will
receive an email from UPS/Fed Ex Service along with a
packet number.. It will
say that they were unable to deliver a package sent to you
on such-and-such a
date. It then asks you to print out the invoice copy
attached. 
DON'T TRY TO PRINT THIS. IT LAUNCHES THE VIRUS! 
Pass this warning on to all your PC operators
at work and home. This virus has caused Millions of
dollars in damage in the
past few days.

Message-ID: <1c5437370906140837p466fde3bn4b9d5de8d203b042@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

The results of the survey for the Bangalore OWASP Meetings is as follows:

*17 entries came in for the survey* (including myself), which is not very
encouraging, considering the size of the mailing list is 300+

Time Most Conducive for OWASP Meetings

   1. 7 am to 11 am - 33%
   2. *11 am to 2 pm - 60%*
   3. 2 pm to 6 pm - 6.7%
   4. 6 pm onwards - 0%

Day of the week most conducive for OWASP Meetings:

   1. Weekday - 0%
   2. Saturday - 47.1%
   3. *Sunday - 52.9%*

Abhay

Hi Guys,

Thanks for all the replies..... I found the Stinger project to be
pretty useful.  I tested it for a sample app against non-persistent
XSS and found it effective.  the question is, since stinger encodes
the string, how would the DB (MySQL, postgres) treat it.  Would the
special characters cause a problem or would it function smoothly?

Comments from anyone who has used it previously.

Regards,
Chaitanya

Abhay,

Can you share the numbers please? In the 17, I am also included. So,
technically only 15 voted. How many regular's are there in the 15? Lets
deduct that and see how many newbies have voted and then make the final call
on the upcoming meeting.

Message-ID: <3895ddbf0906250907p15d123b6w1123d4f3d7e958b6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys



On this sunday(21st jun 2k9), found few critical personal data open on
Outlook Money website  which i twitted After it has been fixed etc.. [i.e.
first it is fixed and then i twitted !!! just to avoid any confusion.]

Now i just wanted to know why to put disclosure or bring this to public
(After it has been fixed !) ?  [if they are not fixing and to force them to
fix, doing public disclsure is fine ...But once they have done the fix...
Should one ?]


Open for thoughts !

Hello Raxit,I just want to recollect, what I understood from your email.

"Some vulnerability in outlook money website has been reported and fixed.. But even after the fix, you are still able to exploit the vulnerability."

I this case, I would suggest to go for public-disclosure. Please correct me if I misunderstood something.

Regards,
Vikas

What he means is...Why talk about a vulnerability that is already fixed....

We all learn from something that already happened. if you see any security
tutorial, They talk about how some websites 'were' hacked they never teach
you how to hack.
Thats for you to figure out.

It is like reading the poems of other great poets to get inspired and write
your own.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Why full/public disclosure of WebAppSec
	hack/vulnerability !
Message-ID: <207189.12092.qm@web53705.mail.re2.yahoo.com>


Hi Raxit,

The main idea of public disclosure is to tell public (the users of the application) that a particular version of the product has a vulnerability and they should patch the application by the patch provided by the vendor to avoid any attacks. Ethically public disclosures are not done to force the vendor to fix the issue.

This means that the public disclosure should happen under the criteria set by the finder and the vendor after the fix is provided.

You can contact few popular websites to get your findings out. Ideally tell the version that has the problem, and the patch that fixes it.

thanks,
apurv

Hi Prashanth,

It's important to talk about it so that the end user knows about the problem and would help them decide to upgrade the application or not. It at times is critical to know why an upgrade is essential. Either because of the new functionality or bug fixes (including security).

Here it?s not important "how" to exploit a vulnerability, but the awareness of the problem that exists.

thanks,
apurv

It is not application it is website ! its not at all under user's control !
Disclosing one more vulnerabitliy of Gmail will help you in anyway (just for
example !) ?

U stole the words from my mouth Raxit. Exactly. Google has had an XSS
vulnerability with multibyte chars if i am not wrong about a year back...did
u know about it?
Yahoo search has had a search redirection logic that could be used for
phising. which also I presume from hte date of the blog, that it was a year
back.

Disclaimer: I read about them in blogs and some books some time back. Can't
give any references.

Allright. My bad. I read Raxit's mail in a giffy. I was under the impression that he was talking about an application, and I would stand by my words if it was an application. But if it's a site we are talking about, yes, I hear what you are saying.

Anyone with experience reporting to CERT-IN? They have a special
mention on their website for vulnerability reporting
http://www.cert-in.org.in/vul-reporting.htm

It says you could fill a form and email them.

CERT-IN website. The person on the other end cut the phone as soon as
heard me say vulnerability.
