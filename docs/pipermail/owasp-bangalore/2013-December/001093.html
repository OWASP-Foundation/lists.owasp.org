1. Reiterate the importance of digital privacy and cyber security to the
success of democracy and the continued protection of free expression.
2. Encourage us to see ourselves as part of a larger system of democratic
governance and civic participation. This means understanding how technical
capabilities intersect with civil society, and then use them to advocate
for a more open, accessible, and private cyberspace.
3. Reinforce that digital media literacy education is vital to ensuring a

Additionally, the speaker will present ideas and recommendations for what
