<PRE>Hi Hari,

I have also been a member but could not see/initiate/participate in any 
activity. Probably the number of users are quite less here. But as far as 
my experience goes, there are many people in Bangalore who are working in 
Security domain and have been quite active.

Anyways, let us first decide upon some kind of agenda and then perhaps we 
can meet. If this agenda is to just welcome/meet and decide on activities, 
I feel that could be done on mails/forums itself (as not many are in an 
active phase).

Let us see the mail's reaction. I am expecting some mails on this thread. 
Get started group :-)

Regards,
Mayank Bhatnagar
