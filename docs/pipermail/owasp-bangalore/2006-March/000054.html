<PRE>Hello Mayank,

Any particular reason why you would not be able to make it this weekend? It
would be great if you can be there...

Barista (Beside William Penn showroom) in Koramangala opens at 7 AM. So, can
we catch up there? 

Alternatively, Shanti Sagar on the Koramangala main road (100 Ft Road) is
also open which can accommodate people to sit and eat. 

Any more suggestions are also welcome..

If we can confirm, then I will post it on the web site.

Regards,
Hari

Hi Hari,

Thanks for keeping us all connected. Seems most of the members can 
converge with Sat morning....in my last mail I had discussed about general 
OWASP working group agenda. I think in this meeting the most important 
(from my point of view) work could be

 	a) Identifying why we are here
 	b) how do we relate ourselves to security
 	c) individual introduction and his/her interests/view on security
 	d) ofcourse breakfast, coffee (you can have tea as well :-) )
 	e) Responsibilities
 		- Making the group active
 		- Initiating some kind of activities (may be tools 
knowledge &amp; usage, standard docs, practices etc)

Anything else ..... group....

Also Sat morning, time can be confirmed.....8.30 or 9.00am seems 
nice.....dont know whether shops are opened at that time....

Personally I will not be able to attend the meeting but will definitely 
ping you guys to get updated what happened....I request Akash (my friend 
and former colleague to update you all about C-DAC'a security group 
activities....)


Regards,
Mayank
