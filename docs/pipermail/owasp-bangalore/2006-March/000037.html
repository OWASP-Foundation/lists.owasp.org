Hello Mayank,

Welcome to the OWASP Bangalore Chapter and thank you for kick starting a
thread. Yes, as you mentioned, there are quite a number of people in
Bangalore who work with the Security domain, but have not been on to OWASP.
As far as my understanding goes, only people with interest have joined here
(as this is not a yahoo group where everyone registers). I strongly feel
that the potential to meet and discuss is not being utilized. 

I have started welcome messages long time back, but have not seen any
replies. You are the first one to start. 

It would be good if we can discuss over mails and also make some time to
meet so that we develop 'togetherness'.

Anticipating many mails to pour in...

Your Partner in Learning,
Hari

Hi Hari,

I have also been a member but could not see/initiate/participate in any 
activity. Probably the number of users are quite less here. But as far as 
my experience goes, there are many people in Bangalore who are working in 
Security domain and have been quite active.

Anyways, let us first decide upon some kind of agenda and then perhaps we 
can meet. If this agenda is to just welcome/meet and decide on activities, 
I feel that could be done on mails/forums itself (as not many are in an 
active phase).

Let us see the mail's reaction. I am expecting some mails on this thread. 
Get started group :-)

Regards,
Mayank Bhatnagar
