<PRE>Hello Hari, Mayank and group,

Its good to see some activity kicking in at last.
It would be good if we could have a prelim meeting of some sorts--as a
means of networking, knowledge sharing etc.

Always open to ideas.

Heres hoping the others in the group chip in with their responses.

Thanks
Karthik A

Hello Mayank,

Welcome to the OWASP Bangalore Chapter and thank you for kick starting a
thread. Yes, as you mentioned, there are quite a number of people in
Bangalore who work with the Security domain, but have not been on to
OWASP.
As far as my understanding goes, only people with interest have joined
here (as this is not a yahoo group where everyone registers). I strongly
feel that the potential to meet and discuss is not being utilized. 

I have started welcome messages long time back, but have not seen any
replies. You are the first one to start. 

It would be good if we can discuss over mails and also make some time to
meet so that we develop 'togetherness'.

Anticipating many mails to pour in...

Your Partner in Learning,
Hari

Hi Hari,

I have also been a member but could not see/initiate/participate in any
activity. Probably the number of users are quite less here. But as far
as my experience goes, there are many people in Bangalore who are
working in Security domain and have been quite active.

Anyways, let us first decide upon some kind of agenda and then perhaps
we can meet. If this agenda is to just welcome/meet and decide on
activities, I feel that could be done on mails/forums itself (as not
many are in an active phase).

Let us see the mail's reaction. I am expecting some mails on this
thread. 
Get started group :-)

Regards,
Mayank Bhatnagar
