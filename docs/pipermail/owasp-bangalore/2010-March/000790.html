Durex condom orders leak on web

Remember the Astroglide&lt;<A HREF="http://archive.pogowasright.org/article.php?story=20070421094259854">http://archive.pogowasright.org/article.php?story=20070421094259854</A>&gt;
breach &lt;<A HREF="http://archive.pogowasright.org/article.php?story=20070423173959506">http://archive.pogowasright.org/article.php?story=20070423173959506</A>&gt;,
when customers who ordered samples of the lubricant had their personal
details exposed online? Now there are allegations that Durex condom orders
were leaking on the web.

Last week, this site [databreaches.net &lt;<A HREF="http://www.databreaches.net/">http://www.databreaches.net/</A>&gt;]
received a lead about a security problem involving the web site of a Durex
product. On March 5, a customer reportedly discovered that anyone could view
his and other customers&#8217; orders on the kohinoorpassion.com web site by
simply inserting a different order ID number in the url without any login
required. Names, addresses, phone numbers, and type of products ordered were
all there for ready viewing. The orders had not been placed on the
kohninoorpassion.com web site, but on the Durex India e-store
site&lt;<A HREF="http://www.durexindia.com/estore">http://www.durexindia.com/estore</A>&gt;.


&gt;<i>From what the customer could determine, the earliest order exposed online
</I>dated back to February 23, 2009, but there is no confirmation as to for how
long the customer records might have been accessible without a login.
According to the customer&#8217;s web site about the breach, no credit card or
financial data were exposed.

The customer reported that he promptly contacted TTK-LIG (the marketer of
the Durex brand in India and manufacturer of Kohinoor condoms) and SSL
International (the owner of the Durex brand worldwide) about the problem and
that by the next day, the site appeared to be better secured. But that
wasn&#8217;t the end of the story, it seems. The customer created his own web site
and FAQ about the breach
&lt;<A HREF="http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/home">http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/home</A>&gt;and has been
updating it since then. A review of the updates suggest that
things took an ugly turn within a matter of weeks.

It started cordially enough. By email on March 6, TTK-LIG thanked the
customer for alerting them to the problem, and indicated that they would be
sending him a gift hamper by courier and SSL International also reportedly
responded to the customer. Neither indicated that they would be notifying
any customers of the exposure, however, which was less than satisfactory to
the customer.

On March 18, the lawyers appeared. TTK-LIG&#8217;s attorneys allegedly sent a
threat letter to the customer, reproduced
here&lt;<A HREF="http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/updates/07legalnoticefromttk-liglimited">http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/updates/07legalnoticefromttk-liglimited</A>&gt;.
It said, in part:

5. During their on-going investigations, our client discovered to their
shock from their records that, between the time of intimation to our client
on March 5, 2010 at around 1.40 pm India time and the subsequent remedial
actions to provide full security to our client&#8217;s website on 5th March 2010
at around 11:40 pm India time, you have unauthorisedly downloaded 3,906
order details relating to 2,753 customers, who have transacted with our
client through their e-store. You had no business or any authority to
download and / or copy the personal information relating to other customers
and deal with the same, in breach of the terms of the user of the said
e-store or otherwise and you have breached the confidentiality of the other
customers. Your action breaches the terms of the user of the said e-store.
Such misuse of our client&#8217;s website constitutes, among others, an offence
punishable under the Information Technology Act read with the provisions of
Indian Penal Code.

6. We on behalf of our client state that the civil and criminal wrong
already committed by you under the pretext of discovering a so-called &#8216;data
breach&#8217; in our client&#8217;s websites, has stood aggravated by your further acts
which include the following:

i. Creation of a website which has the effect of falsely instilling a sense
of alarm in the minds of our client&#8217;s customers and posting various comments
therein;

ii. Contacting various customers of our client on the basis of information
unauthorisedly extracted by you from our client&#8217;s website and thereby
inter-alia infringing their privacy. In this regard, our client wishes to
add that at least five customers have written to our client in this matter
after being alerted by an email generated from the email address
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-bangalore">durexwhistleblower at gmail.com.</A>

[...]

The letter concluded with the typical lawyerly demands.

On March 19, the customer says that he
replied&lt;<A HREF="http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/updates/08responsetolegalnotice">http://sites.google.com/site/durexdatabreach/updates/08responsetolegalnotice</A>&gt;,
in part:

5. Kindly note that unless you are either able to appropriately substantiate
your allegations or I receive a full retraction of all allegations made
against me in your note and an unconditional apology from your client within
24 hours of your receipt of this letter via email or at any rate by 10 am on
March 21, 2010, I fully intend to (i) commence legal proceedings against
your client for serious breach of my privacy and gross negligence with data
received in connection with a purchase I made from your client of an
intensely personal nature, and (ii) to widely publicise the contents of your
legal notice and related information in my possession in the public interest
and exercising my rights to protected free speech.

Both the lawyers&#8217; deadline and the customer&#8217;s deadline came and went. E-mail
inquiries sent to both TTK-LIG and SSL International on Saturday were not
answered by the time of this publication.
