Hi All,

We are moving to a new platform for the Owasp Chapters. I will be updating
the mailing list in the new group. However, requesting you as well to join
Here's a "one-click" link to join the new Google Group:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/bangalore-chapter/join

We've create a Google doc that explains how to join a Google Group for
people with existing Google/@owasp.org accounts and *those you don't want
to create Google accounts*. *You don't have to have a Google account to
join, send and receive email from a Google Group*.How to join with or
without a Google account is documented here
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA>
.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You,
