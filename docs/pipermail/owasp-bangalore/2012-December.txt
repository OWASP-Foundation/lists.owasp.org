Message-ID: <2BFAB8A31E9BD54A8B7CC07BCD019706088FB10A@chnshlmbx14>

Hi All,
                We are in the process of arriving at the Security best practices or Security framework containing view per paradigm (Web, intranet, extranet) for the different areas of Web Application i.e. UI layer, Database layer, Business layer, Services layer, Transport across layers . The different categories that are targeted in Security framework are Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability, Non-repudiation .

                There are a lot of material available for Secure SDLC practices but little on the above topic. Any pointers will be of great help. Thanks in advance!

Kind Regards,
Archana
