Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Suggestion for a good Web security scanner
Message-ID: <AANLkTimHS-ef3iprhd8AJQmSWB-Cce-5kgQTj2TqDSM=@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Fellow OWASPers,

I've been trying to evaluate tools that would help me find XSS and other
security loopholes on a given site.

Scanmus is one that is not available to anyone outside of Yahoo!
Acunetix is another that I found.
Burpsuite Professional doesn't let users trial the software before buying
it.
It is difficult to evaluate these software without getting hold of a copy.

Any suggestions or pointers from your experiences would be highly
appreciated

PS: Excuse me about cross posting to bangalore and chennai lists, incase
there are people subscribed to both.

Thanks,
Rajagopal

Hi,

Try Netsparker OR Nstalker.. I found both are good.. Netsparker has
extensive pen test built in so use it very cautiously on production..

Let me know any other good tool apart from these even i am also evaluating..
I am looking at somthing URL injection should also detect..

Because now a days i am coming across lot of URL injection on the cached
pages..If any one has idea how to check this kind of attack that would be
very helpful also how to mitigate or take care if affected sites. I am new
to this...

Thanks in advance..

OSCAR

Hi Natarajan,

Not sure if you have already evaluated these, but some other commercial scanners I know are Cenzic, WebInspect, Appscan. I heard false positives are less in Cenzic but tool is  not user friendly. Webinspect, is easy to navigate, gives users multiple options to customize their scans with various crawling methods. Privilege escalation checks and some of the authorization checks can be done in Cenzic but is not available with Web Inspect. Pricing part, I think web inspect is costlier than Cenzic.

Thank you,

SEKHAR

I would like to know the challenges of improving our Bangalore community very 
well, and would like to support on each and every activity.? Feel free to share 
your thoughts on our next OWASP meet (separate - I know we are all meeting in

(Bangalore) grow bigger.

Hi Gandhi,

My details may not be of interest of you at all, but without that I don't
want to make this email sound like a trivial 'how did you do it' question.

I've just been introduced to python scripting language after having spent 3
years on manual testing. Through one python mailing list I found Owasp and I
think you seem to be the right person to ask this to: how does one begin to
build a career in Infosec?

I'll be very grateful, if you could please take some of your precious time
to bring light to this question.

Regards,
Fibinse

Hi Gandhi,

Nice to hear the name McAfee (I am an ex-McAfee employee :)). Anyways, just
1 question. Why concentrating only Bangalore audience? I am right now
working with Adobe, Noida and I am sure there will be quite a many people
like me who are not in Bangalore anymore.

Thanks,
Arun

Nice to hear from you Arun.? I am not only focussing on Bangalore, but want to 
change the India Charter, and?need to promote as we are far behind to the rest 
of the Charters.

Could you please go-ahead volunteer yourself and start a community at NOIDA & 
Delhi, and share the updates to me every Saturday (in case we need to jump on 
Concall, will do so).? Also share me what are your issues that blocks?OWASP 
meets regularly, please share to me, such that we will get them resolved.

At this moment I consider you as a Active Volunteer for OWASP Noida/Delhi 
Charter.?Let me know incase of any concerns.

I need to have OWASP regular meets every Week and Knowledge sharing sessions 
that will happen and I'll update you related some interesting news for the OWASP 
members (who will join as a member, as we are working out nice options for OWASP 
members) and the rest of the changes happening only for ASIA Charters.

Hence, there you go...

Hi Gandhi,

Nice to hear the name McAfee (I am an ex-McAfee employee :)). Anyways, just 1 
question. Why concentrating only Bangalore audience? I am right now working with 
Adobe, Noida and I am sure there will be quite a many people like me who are not 
in Bangalore anymore.

Thanks,
Arun

Correction: OWASP Delhi community already exists and allows participation
from the entire NCR region which makes it the largest community comparing to
any other OWASP local chapter. http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Delhi 

 

Volunteers interested to participate at OWASP Delhi can connect with the
OWASP Delhi committee members
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Delhi#OWASP_Delhi_Committee_Members) to get
updates on past events, industry communication, registration, etc. and we
would be glad in offering assistance on taking the OWASP flagship forward.

 

Gandhi, Let us connect offline and discuss.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Nice to hear from you Arun.  I am not only focussing on Bangalore, but want
to change the India Charter, and need to promote as we are far behind to the
rest of the Charters.

 

Could you please go-ahead volunteer yourself and start a community at NOIDA
& Delhi, and share the updates to me every Saturday (in case we need to jump
on Concall, will do so).  Also share me what are your issues that blocks
OWASP meets regularly, please share to me, such that we will get them
resolved.

 

At this moment I consider you as a Active Volunteer for OWASP Noida/Delhi
Charter. Let me know incase of any concerns.

 

I need to have OWASP regular meets every Week and Knowledge sharing sessions
that will happen and I'll update you related some interesting news for the
OWASP members (who will join as a member, as we are working out nice options
for OWASP members) and the rest of the changes happening only for ASIA
Charters.

 

Hence, there you go...

My details may not be of interest of you at all, but without that I don't
want to make this email sound like a trivial 'how did you do it' question.

 

I've just been introduced to python scripting language after having spent 3
years on manual testing. Through one python mailing list I found Owasp and I
think you seem to be the right person to ask this to: how does one begin to
build a career in Infosec?

 

I'll be very grateful, if you could please take some of your precious time
to bring light to this question.

Hi Team,

 

It was nice talking to you through this email.  I am Gandhi working with
McAfee, had a chance to participate in OWASP - Global Summit, Portugal from
India.  There were lot of things that I have discussed regarding OWASP

Could you please let me know are we all have a common place to meet (similar
to NULCON), and do similar sessions every 3rd or 4th of every month, such
that we will be all meeting in a common place.

 

Also would like to know a volunteer that will be the single point of contact
for organising these events, and share the updates on Information Security
as OWASP rest of the charters were really doing well compared to India
charter, and we do have plan to organise a world summit in 2012 in India -
especially Bangalore.

 

I would like to know the challenges of improving our Bangalore community
very well, and would like to support on each and every activity.  Feel free
to share your thoughts on our next OWASP meet (separate - I know we are all
meeting in NULL) to discuss on the challenges, and chalk out a plan to make
OWASP (Bangalore) grow bigger.

 

Also could you please send to ME the list of the audience who are currently
in the list of the community in the below format, such that I'll consolidate
and share the details to the thread such that every one knows who we are all

Yes Correct! Delhi Chapter is already there and very much alive and kicking.
First time I saw mail from Gandhi, I was bit confused between Charter and
Chapter. :)
But yes as far as Delhi Chapter is concerned, it already exists.
