Vimal, thanks for sharing this info.
 
I find it really odd that when queried in google, most security
companies in bangalore do not show up. Anyone aware where we can find a
comprehensive list?

The websites of two of the net's most critical oversight organizations
were hijacked by Turkish hackers who sent visitors to rogue pages that
challenged the overseers' authority.

People who tried to visit the sites were greeted with a message that
read: "You think that you control the domains but you don't! Everybody
knows wrong. We control the domains including ICANN! Don't you believe
us?"

Team,

Have not heard from anyone as to how the Security Camp went? I could not
attend the camp as i was doing a course during that week.

Hari,

Security Camp was good. The best and worst point being one -- low attendance.
Apart from the regular talks, Akash and the lady (I am unable to
recall her name, apologies :P ) presented the introductory talk on
OWASP. I am not sure how fruitful it's going to be, but there were
quite a few inquisitive creatures at the meet. Oh and yes, almost all
the members from the _core team_ (if I dare use that word) were
present.
I am sure others will add-in if I missed anything important.

Now, two things apart from the meet:
1. I have been working on the college thing I proposed, and have
prepared a list of some engineering colleges in Bangalore. Will
discuss during the monthly meet, which I presume is on 30th of July.
2. I am trying to get permission to host the monthly meet at my office
at Hebbal. Would that be okay for everyone?

Bipin,

Fantastic efforts. Yes, let us try to discuss this during our monthly
meeting.

Also, it is great that you are finding a place for us to meet and i can
definitely understand that is a bit far for many of OWASP members. However,
as we are getting some space to work together, it is a good idea to utilize
the opportunity.

On the other hand, if anyone has any other options, please shoot them out
and we can decide based on convenience for most of the members.

Can we decide on the venu and time for the meet please?

Regards,
Hari

Hi Hari,

I am Sreedhar Ambati came to SecureCamp.
I liked most of the sessions except OWASP introduction.
Aakash and Manjula .. they couldnt able to convince the folk about the
importance of OWASP.
I know personally OWASP is very important as security is taking important
role in web application development and other projects.
First of all speakers should have full zeal and enthusiasm in their speech.
They are very committed people.No doubt about it.
But they have to show the same enthusiasm before audience too.

Thanks
Sreedhar Ambati
