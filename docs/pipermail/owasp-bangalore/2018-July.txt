You can use the combination of StringEscapeUtils from Apache commons API
and regex based whitelists for xss prevention.

Cheers,

An excellent place to start with Threat Modelling is to look at

https://www.reddit.com/r/threatmodeling/

Adam Shostack (Author of the best book on Threat Modeling) himself is part
of the sub reddit.

If you are looking at a light weigh way to get started with Data Flow
Diagrams consider using OWASP Threat Dragon to create those and enumerate
the risks.

Also I am keenly awaiting more documentation or video from this particular
talk at the recently concluded OWASP Summit.

I second Akash's recommendations.

I'd also like to add the following:

   - https://www.owasp.org/images/a/aa/AppSecEU2012_PASTA.pdf => PASTA
   Threat Modeling Methodology
   -
   https://2017.appsec.eu/presos/CISO/Threat%20Modeling%20with%20PASTA%20-%20Risk%20Centric%20Application%20Threat%20Modeling%20Case%20Studies%20-%20Tony%20UcedaV%C3%A9lez%20-%20OWASP_AppSec-Eu_2017.pdf
   => Similar Presentation on Threat Modeling
   - I'd recommend some work done by Continuum Security as well.
   - I have been extensively involved with both attack and defensive threat
   modeling, specifically around automation and integrating it into
   AGILE/SCRUM like environments. Here's an article:
   https://medium.com/@abhaybhargav/a-gentle-introduction-to-abuser-stories-for-scrum-teams-90df52652a63
      - A tool that we have authored (open source) that expounds and adds
      on to these concepts, called ThreatPlaybook:

Hi,

There is Microsoft Threat modeling tool -
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/security/azure-security-threat-modeling-tool.md

To start work community edition would be useful.
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/secdevblog/2017/04/21/whats-new-with-microsoft-threat-modeling-tool-preview/

A good place to start is the OWASP REST Security Cheat Sheet -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet

Another popular checklist is by Shieldfy
https://github.com/shieldfy/API-Security-Checklist

As to your question about JSON or XML I am not sure that is a security
requirement either ways. That choice should depend on the API requirement
and design.

I am not sure I understand the following question.

*What ext for secure REST calls?*
