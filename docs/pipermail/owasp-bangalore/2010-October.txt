*Reverse Honey Trap - Striking Deep inside Online Web Antivirus Engines and
Analyzers*


Web based online anti viruses are used heavily for scanning malware files
and providing the resultant output. There are number of online service
providers which perform inline scanning of uploaded malware executables by
the normal user or the victims. This process is based on the hierarchical
functions and different steps opted to analyze the viruses and other worm
activities. The infections occur dynamically when the executable becomes
active in the environment. Everything is automated in this process as
servers residing at the backend scan the executable and sent the information
to other third party servers for secondary analysis or updating their record
directly. That?s how the normal functioning of free online malware scanner
works.

*Notorious Datacenter Support Systems - Pwning through Outer Sphere*
*Exploitation Analysis of Help Desk Systems*

The online world has been encountering massive levels of malware attacks in
the
recent times. The outbreak of injected malware has reinforced its
devastating stance by
contaminating a large number of websites. Most of the traces have been found
in the
websites under shared and virtual hosting which further includes content
from third
party delivery networks. Well, it?s the truth that a minor inherited
weakness in applied
software can cause havoc if exploited appropriately. Recent mass level
attacks have
endorsed this fact. This paper talks about the nature of techniques used by
malware
writers engaged in performing continuous analysis of differential malware.
The paper
aims at knowledge sharing by presenting the layout of datacenter compromises
through
simple support systems used for assisting the customers. The reality of
support system
shows the nature of insecure work functionality which is exploited heavily
by malware
writers. This paper is an outcome of real time analysis of compromised
systems. This
paper has been generalized for security and responsible disclosure reasons.
