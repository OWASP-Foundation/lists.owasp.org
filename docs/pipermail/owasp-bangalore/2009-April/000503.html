*Title:* Security aspects of Wireless Cellular Systems

*ACM Tech Talk
*
The use of mobile phones based on cellular technology is prevalent the world
over. As users, we take for granted that our
conversations and data are secure. As these systems become more widespread,
they become more of a target for those
who want access to other people&#8217;s information.

This talk is an insight into security aspects of wireless cellular systems,
primarily GSM/GPRS and UMTS. The talk will
cover security across different domains - subscriber, network, application
and radio control. Algorithms and security
procedures used in cellular systems will be introduced.

The speaker shall also address the security concerns of the startup
companies who are venturing into the space of wireless
and mobility.

*About the Speaker*
An alumni of the National University of Singapore, Arvind Padmanabhan has 13
years of experience in the field of wireless
telecommunication since 1996. Presently, he is working as the Technical
Director of Sloka Telecom Corp, a startup venture
developing WiMAX basestations and NMS solutions.  In his previous
assignments, Arvind was working for ST Microelectronics
Inc, Singapore and later at Altran Technologies Inc, UK. Arvind Padmanabhan
was involved in the UMTS and GPRS protocol
stack development with ST Microelectronics. At Anritsu, UK, he was involved
with HSDPA, HSUPA, GSM and MBMS
technologies.
