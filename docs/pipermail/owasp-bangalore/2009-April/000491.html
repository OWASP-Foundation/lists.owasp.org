<PRE>Hello Everyone,

For past sometime, I have been reading something or other about our Vedic culture and also the scientific verification of the advanced facts mentioned there. Below mentioned articles might give more information in this direction:
Blog Entry: <A HREF="http://think-smile.blogspot.com/2009/03/scientific-verification-of-vedic.html">http://think-smile.blogspot.com/2009/03/scientific-verification-of-vedic.html</A>
Youtube: <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY4Q2xx7BTc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY4Q2xx7BTc</A>

Now having said that, I have been thinking that be it Cyber Security or physical security, there must be some basic rule or security design which might be mentioned in any of our ancient books. Probably we are putting are effort in the wrong directions and that is why internet is still very insecure.

One example could be, information and knowledge is for sharing purpose like OWASP and GNU are working. Now take the case of entertainment industry. They are trying to invent technology that can stop piracy but if we think it from design perspective &quot;Knowledge/Fun is to share, not to patent and sell&quot; like Vedas, Ramayana and Mahabharata. Any geek would agree that there can't be any piracy protection technology, which can't be cracked. So in a way we are putting our effort in wrong direction. 

Similarly, what is the right direction/design for security? If anyone like to share any information or anyone whom they thing could give me some direction, that would be a great help.

Regards,
Vikas
