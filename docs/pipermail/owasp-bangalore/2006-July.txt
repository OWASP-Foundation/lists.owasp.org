Hi,

   Gr8 hari, at last you came from nowhere :-) 

What I suggest is those who are interested in "OWASP group" not OWASP,
letz meetup and plan how we can make our Bangalore chapter active. Let
the mailings and discussions continue via the mailing list. 

 

A club or a group will be active and lively only when some events
happen. So we have to conduct some sessions or training programs. 

People from the group itself can take that. I can see a lotz of
experienced persons in our mailing list.  

 

Thanks & Regards,

    Deepson Thomas

Hello All,

 

I sincerely apologize for being silent for quite a long time. Life has
been really hectic and I am trying to sort things out...

 

Thank you Deepson, for introducing me.

 

For one question which I read about OWASP India chapter, let me keep you
posted that there are various chapters around India, but I really don't
know how active they are. Visit www.owasp.org <http://www.owasp.org/>
and check out all chapters in the interactive map :-)

 

When we met last time (Deepson, Akash (if I am not wrong) and myself),
we decided to meet once in a month on the third Saturday. 

 

This weekend and the next, I am tied up with work. If you wanna meet, I
would definitely encourage that. But, I will be there from the next
meeting. 

 

If we can work on bringing OWASP Conference to India, that would be
great, but it's a huge task. 

 

Keep writing folks...

 

Regards,

Hari

Hi everyone,
 
It's now fantastically easy to upload presentations to your OWASP chapter
page.  All you need to do is click on the "upload" link at the very bottom
of the left-hand menu.  You select the file from your hard drive and it's
added to the wiki.
 
If you add the category [[Category:OWASP Presentations]] to the "image"
page, the presentation will show up in the list of all presentations in the
menu.
 
You can create a link to the presentation by using a link like
[[Image:filename.ppt]] or [[Media:filename.ppt]] in your page.
 
And don't forget to notify us on the chapter leader list that you've posted
a presentation. Then maybe we can all share!
 
Thanks,
 
--Jeff

www.nikun.net/chat .. specially built for ppl in companies that block
IM .. ;-)

I am planning to put up a jabber server soon, once thats done we can
have a tunnel listener set up on port 80, so that you can use gaim to
chat even from inside company networks where IM is blocked. Probably
latter, I will also put in the yahoo and hotmail gateways on it.

Deep is it possible for you to come online on nikun.net/chat ?

.. also everybody else, whenever there's time, we can meet here for
chat.

For example I didn't recieve the "meeting on 22 july" mail directly
either, I only saw it in the daily digest. Am I missing something :(

and is it possible that we have the meetings sheduled on sundays rather
than saturdays since most of are held up with work even on saturdays

Hi All,
 
Thought of sharing this piece of information with you all:
 
McAfee launches security journal
Bangalore, July 26

Security firm McAfee announced the launch of Sage, a semi-annual
security journal designed to update and inform technical personnel and
security executives on cutting-edge security topics to help them make
more informed security decisions. The premier issue of Sage includes
feature articles, op-eds and in-depth technical pieces by respected
industry experts discussing compelling security topics, including the
role of financial incentives in malware, the widespread adoption of open
source philosophy and practices in malware development, and the effects
of increasingly professional-grade malware. Sage is available for
download through the McAfee Threat Centre:
http://www.mcafee.com/us/threat_center/default.asp
 
Been there and downloaded the journal:
http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/threat_center/mcafee
_sage_v11_en.pdf
 
Cheers,
- Ranjith

Hello Sundar,

The MOM and meeting dates will be posted on
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bangalore.

Coming to your point of meeting on Sundays, my personal opinion is that it
would be difficult for people with families. Usually Saturdays people work
and relax completely on Sundays. 

If we can have more attendance on Sunday, then I absolutely don't mind
meeting on Sunday too. 

Let others throw in their thoughts.

Regards,
Hari

Hi All,
Till now I have just sent mails and not been in a position to meet you people :)
And again the date you have fixed is not possible for me ...
If you people dont mind , could we postpone the meeting so that we get more attendance
and I would definitely turn up this time :)
 
With Regards,
-Himanshu

Hello Sundar,

The MOM and meeting dates will be posted on
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bangalore.

Coming to your point of meeting on Sundays, my personal opinion is that
it
would be difficult for people with families. Usually Saturdays people
work
and relax completely on Sundays.

If we can have more attendance on Sunday, then I absolutely don't mind
meeting on Sunday too.

Let others throw in their thoughts.

Regards,
Hari

Since all the members are in Bangalore and since most of the people
usually take weekends off to travel somewhere or spend time with families,
How about having the meeting on a weekeday evening ? I suspect this will
be much easier for everyone to attend than on a weekend.

What do others think ?

thanks,

Hi,
  No way. Coz even the actual office timing is 9 to 6, as per my
knowledge almost everybody will be there in office even after that :)

This model was tried by the Bangalore Linux user group and the
participation, shot up overnight. I, for one, am out of town most of the
weekends :)

Hi All,
Till now I have just sent mails and not been in a position to meet you
people :)
And again the date you have fixed is not possible for me ...
If you people dont mind , could we postpone the meeting so that we get more
attendance
and I would definitely turn up this time :)

With Regards,
-Himanshu

Hello Sundar,

The MOM and meeting dates will be posted on
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bangalore
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bangalore> .

Coming to your point of meeting on Sundays, my personal opinion is that
it
would be difficult for people with families. Usually Saturdays people
work
and relax completely on Sundays.

If we can have more attendance on Sunday, then I absolutely don't mind
meeting on Sunday too.

Let others throw in their thoughts.

Regards,
Hari

hi everyone,
It was really sad that i missed the first meet,
but still looking for the next meet.
can we the meet minuted and the same in brief  be uploaded
so that that would help people like me wo had ha missed out.
and is it possible that we have the meetings sheduled on sundays rather
than saturdays since most of are held up with work even on saturdays

Since all the members are in Bangalore and since most of the people
usually take weekends off to travel somewhere or spend time with families,
How about having the meeting on a weekeday evening ? I suspect this will
be much easier for everyone to attend than on a weekend.

What do others think ?

Hi,
  No way. Coz even the actual office timing is 9 to 6, as per my
knowledge almost everybody will be there in office even after that :)

This model was tried by the Bangalore Linux user group and the
participation, shot up overnight. I, for one, am out of town most of the
weekends :)

Hi all,
        Which is the best XSS and SQL scanner (preferably OS) available?
Currently I use Cenzic hailstorm, but too frustrated with its false
positives.
