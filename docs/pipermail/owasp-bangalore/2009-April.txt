Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Security Design from Ancient India - Looking for
	inputs
Message-ID: <731505.11193.qm@web95411.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hello Everyone,

For past sometime, I have been reading something or other about our Vedic culture and also the scientific verification of the advanced facts mentioned there. Below mentioned articles might give more information in this direction:
Blog Entry: http://think-smile.blogspot.com/2009/03/scientific-verification-of-vedic.html
Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY4Q2xx7BTc

Now having said that, I have been thinking that be it Cyber Security or physical security, there must be some basic rule or security design which might be mentioned in any of our ancient books. Probably we are putting are effort in the wrong directions and that is why internet is still very insecure.

One example could be, information and knowledge is for sharing purpose like OWASP and GNU are working. Now take the case of entertainment industry. They are trying to invent technology that can stop piracy but if we think it from design perspective "Knowledge/Fun is to share, not to patent and sell" like Vedas, Ramayana and Mahabharata. Any geek would agree that there can't be any piracy protection technology, which can't be cracked. So in a way we are putting our effort in wrong direction. 

Similarly, what is the right direction/design for security? If anyone like to share any information or anyone whom they thing could give me some direction, that would be a great help.

Regards,
Vikas

Interesting! I've always been a fan of applying knowledge from one 
particular field in another. For example, I'd designed a Fraud/Phishing 
IDS for financial institutions based on some statistical tools like 
Control Charts. (Note: Control Charts are pretty controversial :) )

One thing that crosses my mind right now, is the analogy between 
"Chakravyuh" and the "Onion model". Provide protection in several layers 
so that it's either impossible to break through, or the _prize_ isn't 
worth the effort.
I'm sure we can find other similar analogies too. Would love to hear 
what other members have to say.

Sundar,

Last time i visited Coffee House (much after we thought it went for
renovation) it was pretty much open. I even had breakfast there. Can
somebody please check if that place is still up and running (just in case
you happen to be around that area)?

Thanks,
-Sumit

The use of mobile phones based on cellular technology is prevalent the world

they become more of a target for those
who want access to other people?s information.

This talk is an insight into security aspects of wireless cellular systems,
primarily GSM/GPRS and UMTS. The talk will
cover security across different domains - subscriber, network, application
and radio control. Algorithms and security
procedures used in cellular systems will be introduced.

The speaker shall also address the security concerns of the startup
companies who are venturing into the space of wireless
and mobility.
