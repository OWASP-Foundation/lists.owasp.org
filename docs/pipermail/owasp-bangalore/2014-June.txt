We will work on OWASP Mobile Risk M2 : Insecure Data Storage (

sample vulnerable application to understand the cause of the issues as well
as what kind of protection can be applied.

a glimpse of events happening in upcoming one month.

ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web
application security control library that makes it easier for programmers
to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make
it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications.
The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Wiki Updated with a new look
Message-ID: <CA+QUGmMHJCDjPguWKBs5CMWm-7hOw8OhFxM0p1nazRHoyZvwiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I wanted to let you know about a few updations we have made to the OWASP
Bangalore Wiki page.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bangalore

We have also created a short URL

http://bit.ly/owaspblr

The new interface has tabs, I think it makes the whole information easier
to find, do let us know what you feel about that.

Also there are over 600 subscribers to the list, how about telling us what
would you like to use the list for. Especially new joinees share your
reasons for joining.

Thank you.

p.s. The next meet is on the 14th of this month. More details here http://

Message-ID: <CA+QUGmOhBOgT42uh1=FG18axxgrtYUAFLHcsM-bcZD0-9vhFPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Folks,

I am extremely proud to announce that we have another Chapter Leader for
OWASP Bangalore - Mr. Riyaz Walikar

I will leave Mr. Walikar to introduce himself as I will not be able to do
justice to sheer talent he possess and the passion he brings to Application
Security and OWASP.

Just to give you an idea about his skill, he discovered an entirely new
class of attacks called Cross Site Port Attacks (XSPA)
