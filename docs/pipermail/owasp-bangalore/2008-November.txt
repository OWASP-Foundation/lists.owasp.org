http://infosecevents.net/ also keeps track of information security
events around the world. They have mailing lists and feeds and I have

Hellu Everyone,

I am leaving Bangalore and moving to Mumbai in a few days. I wanted to
get together with all the members, new and old, once again before
leaving. And since we didn't have a meet this month, I thought I'd
take the freedom of calling for one.
Would you guys be able to make it on Saturday, Nov. 15th, 9:00 AM?
Venue would be the same - ICH, MG Road, and breakfast on me. ;)

@Hari, Manjula, Syed, Akash:
You guys in town?

Regards,
Bipin Upadhyay.

Message-ID: <3e3d5d7a0811140339h72651e4t4b01e16fadd6c019@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am delighted to share the recent OWASP updates with all the members
here. After the OWASP EU Summit held early this month in Portugal,
OWASP has recently formed global committees
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Committee_Pages].

Puneet Mehta is now part of global chapter committee
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Chapter_Committee] and I
become the part of global conference committee
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Conferences_Committee]. This
is really going to help us in bringing further application security
awareness into Indian industry and invite the best application
security experts under a common platform.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv
OWASP Delhi Board

Hi Bipin, 

I don't think we have met, and wanted to hang around if it was a Saturday. I have a marathon on Sunday and I will be on a 50KM track and will have to miss the breakfast at ICH.

Anyways...we will meet later. Good luck for what ever you are going for.

thanks,
apurv

Hellu Everyone,

I am leaving Bangalore and moving to Mumbai in a few days. I wanted to
get together with all the members, new and old, once again before
leaving. And since we didn't have a meet this month, I thought I'd
take the freedom of calling for one.
Would you guys be able to make it on Saturday, Nov. 15th, 9:00 AM?
Venue would be the same - ICH, MG Road, and breakfast on me. ;)

@Hari, Manjula, Syed, Akash:
You guys in town?

Regards,
Bipin Upadhyay.

Hi All ,
Do find some interesting notes on App security for the newbies.
this is a thread from web appsec community.

Sundar.

*******************************************
For web application security specifically:

The Web Application Hackers Handbook by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto is
currently the gold standard.  It's not small though.

Ajax Security by Billy Hoffman and co is a pretty easy to read book on
"Ajax" and regular web vulnerability security, and is a great place to start
if you have no experience.  It is more conceptual, while the above Web
Application Hackers Handbook goes much deeper into the techniques and
details.

The Database Hackers Handbook is a good starter guide to SQL injection,
which is one of the most common and dangerous things to find in a web
application.

OWASP, particularly the OWASP testing guide, webgoat for a hands-on
tutorial, and conference papers and video for keeping up with the latest
attacks.

WASC(http://www.webappsec.org/), particularly the threat classification.

Also Hacking: the Art of Exploitation , Counter Hack,  Fuzzing: Brute Force
Vulnerability Discovery, and The Art of Software Security Assessment are all
very good.  They are more about general software and network
vulnerabilities, but the knowledge is quite useful in web apps, even though
the days of finding buffer overflows, command injection, and format string
type errors in web apps are mostly behind us.

Security Engineering by Ross Anderson is the best big picture view to
security out there, and is highly recommended.

There's also lots of good training out there if you'd rather go that route.

To be really good at it takes a long time, but you can learn the basics in a
few weeks.

Hope you enjoy the journey!

Steve

Team,
It was really nice to the OWASP Meetings catching up. As discussed today, we
will continue to research on open source participation and next month during
the meet, Sundar will speak on Access Control.

In the mean time, I request you to look at the google doc I created and
update the topic which you would like to listen to or speak about. This
would provide an opportunity for each of us to know who is looking for
what.

If there is a topic in which you are interested in speaking about, please
add your name to the topic or add the topic and append your name to it. We
will go by turns and share our knowledge about the same.

Link to the spreadsheet is
http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pUR25ofggoYQAxXpNRsZ6Ng

At present, I locked the security of the sheet to ensure that you log in
with your google account. If this is difficult and you don't have a google
account, please let me know and I will make it public.

Also, with regards to the links which I spoke about, please find my blog
post Interesting OpenSource Links on my blog www.harisays.wordpress.com.

Bipin, thank you very much for the breakfast treat and wish you all the very
best with your new association.

Regards,
Hari

HI ,
This is one of the vulnerabilities published by students of MIT at DEFCON.
Its a pretty old one, just thought might interest some people.
Just follow the link below for more information

Hi Hari,

For some reason, the document is read-only and is not allowing me to edit,
even though i'm logged in with my gmail id. Would you please look into it?

Thanks to Bipin, even though he will be leaving soon, he has infused some
new momentum. Hope it continues from here.
Best wishes for your future endeavors Bipin, keep in touch!! :-)

Sorry i forgot name of the guy who was discussing about his research on Y!
Messenger password hacking; would you please share the links on the same
with group?

Hello Everybody,
  It's been awhile that I've been running away from a crucial topic called
'CRYPTOGRAPHY'. It is mainly because of mathematics. So, finally I've
made-up my mind that I'll no more be ignorant and I'll work towards
enhancing my mathematical skills required to understand the cryptography
language, algorithms and relations.

 My humble request to everybody is to guide on what aspect or which
mathematical subject that I'am supposed to focus on.

 Thank you and hoping to find a path ahead.

It was nice to be at the OWASP meeting yesterday. Even I am not able to edit
the google spreadsheet. I think the sharing might be chosen as Viewer
instead of Collaborators.

There are two good books on Cryptography by experts

1) Applied Cyrptography - Bruce schneier .. (www.schneier.com)
2) Handbook of applied cryptography - A. Menezes, P. van Oorschot, and S.
Vanstone.

Both are good books but for a bit advanced reader. But as you have mentioned
that you need mathematics first, try doing some applied maths first. try to
study calculus and partial fractions.

Amit

Message-ID: <mailman.0.1227022691.2281.owasp-bangalore@lists.owasp.org>

Google accounts SSL login page suffers from highly critical XSS

Written by Dimitris Pagkalos

Wednesday, 12 November 2008

 

In this case, the fact that SSL is being used on the login page, does not
necessarily mean that the users' login information is secured. UPDATE: this
was fixed a few hours after publishing it.

Malicious people can exploit this Google XSS to propagate malware, spyware,
adware and steal authentication credentials.

It's been a great association so far and will continue be on the
mailing list. I'd have loved if it could go on, but then when you
got-to-go, you got-to-go.
Moreover, you heard Hari. My departure has brought in more participation. ;)

Now looking forward to my association with Mumbai Chapter. Thank you

[image: *]  Web Services and Application Security

[image: *]  Common Application related Threats and Risks seen in Asia
Pacific

[image: *]  Business Risks with Application Security

[image: *]  Vulnerability Research in Application Security

[image: *]  Web Application Penetration Testing

[image: *]  OWASP Tools and Projects

[image: *]  Secure Coding Practices

[image: *]  Technology specific presentations on security such as AJAX, XML,
etc.

[image: *]  Anything else relating to OWASP and Application Security.

The call for papers/presentations is out. The official closing date for
receiving a synopsis of the presentation is December 20th, 2008.
Announcements on selected candidates will be provided the first week of
January 2009. Complete presentations will need to be submitted by the 7th of
