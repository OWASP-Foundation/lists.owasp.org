<PRE>OWASP Bangalore members,

I represent the Mobile Resource Group who oversees the Certified Mobile
Device Security Professional (CMDSP) and have been authorized to extend a
once-in-a-lifetime offer to the Bangalore OWASP community with full
concurrence from the list manager.

As I'm sure you are quite aware, most high-stakes credentials required the
candidate to pass an exam (along with meeting other KSA's and maintaining a
proficiency through CPE's). We feel that our exam needs additional rigors
and needs to be overseen by the profession as a whole (peer review per se').
To accomplish this, we are allowing an initial cadre of mobile device
security pros to receive certification via a scored assessment of their
KSA's in lieu taking the exam. Knowing that other high-stake credentials
such as the CSSLP from ISC2, with the blessing from ANSI, have gone this
route - we decided to move forward with the plan for the first 250 qualified
individuals.

Net - net, here's what we are offering:   Bangalore OWASP has some of the
best technical sessions anywhere, so we are allowing, for a  very limited
time, any OWASP Bangalore member to earn their CMDSP certification WITHOUT
taking an exam!!! 

All you will  need to do is just sign-up for the CMDSP, submit a brief work
history (I've attached the link to the DRAFT submission / qualification form
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cmdsp.org/forms/cmdsp_application_for_certification_v1.0.pdf">http://www.cmdsp.org/forms/cmdsp_application_for_certification_v1.0.pdf</A>&gt; ),
attest to being a member of the Bangalore OWASP group and pay the CMSDP fee.
We'll do the scoring and you will receive your CMDSP credential, assuming
that you meet the scoring criteria outlined within the qualification form.
Of course we'll invite the &quot;best of the best&quot; to be a part of future Job
Task Analysis sessions, Test Development and Item Writing Sessions, and
Study Guides / Prep-Course, etc. You will be forever viewed as one of the
early pioneers and will help put Mobile Device Security in the forefront -
as it needs to be!! 

Please feel free to contact me directly, or reach out to Jim Black, the
CMDSP Program Manager at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-bangalore">jblack at cmdsp.org</A> or +1(240) 258-2107

 

Warm regards,
