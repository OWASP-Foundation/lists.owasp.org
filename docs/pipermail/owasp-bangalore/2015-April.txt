Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Meet is being postponed
Message-ID: <CAJcbuYfWEyZav5j+S2avqXf4DGK_XwZpvkGU4e5GhpZHD1t=yw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

There is a complete Karnataka Bandh tomorrow on 18th of April.

While the final decision hasn't been taken on either cancelling the meet or
postponing it, I would recommend OWASP Bangalore folks to stay indoors and
not risk coming to the meet.

I apologise for the late notice but these are circumstances beyond our
control.

Thank you.

p.s. If you have any questions and prefer calling up my number is
9980527182. If my number is not reachable feel free to try calling Riyaz on
9886042242

Warm regards,
Akash Mahajan

Hi everyone,

My previous mail had a typo... The date I mentioned was on 26th, which was
a mistake. Correct date is Saturday 25th April.

Please let us know if you are interested in giving a talk

Regards

Satish
