All,

It has really been long time since the OWASP-Bangalore Chapter went into
hibernation. With the growing demand and need to application security, I
think this group should start being more pro-active and work towards
building the community stronger.

Over the last few days, I have been personally receiving calls and inquiries
as to what is happening at the chapter and when in the next meeting and
other general questions.

Can we start being active? Why don't we plan for a meeting and then chalk
out a plan for going forward.

Regards,
Hari

Certainly.

I've been an active member in OWASP-Mumbai. My new job is from
Bangalore so I joined this group.

A meeting would be good. I can give a talk on recent appsec vulnerabilities.

Absolutely!
We had met during the DevCamp and had a discussion on the topic, if
you remember :) . I am all in for the revival. We could also use
HouseOfHackers to get others.
I had created a group "Hackers From India". We can use it to dissipate the news.

All,

FYI, We are close to 102 members on the mailing list and I got 10
response's  in total for the below email.

Its time to plan our meet and take the first step towards creating a
revolution :)

Based on my experiences with the other groups I am involved with, I
recommend that we have our first meeting on a Sunday morning. The reason I
am suggesting is that you will not have traffic problems and it would be a
peaceful drive no matter from which part of the city you are coming in and
you will DEFINITELY get parking space.

I do not know where each one is located except for a few. Hence I suggest we
meet at India Coffee House (ICH), on MG Road. This is just beside Deccan
Herald office. This is a very old coffee house and breakfast should not go
over Rs.30 (Including coffee). After we have our first meeting, we can plan
going forward.

Will the coming Sunday (29 June) morning 9 AM suit all of us?

Regards,
Hari

All righty. I did receive around 5 responses to the meeting invite. Rakesh,
I know it a bit early, but give and take another half-an-hour and please do
come down. Once we have a decent crowd and get started, we can plan from
next time with a convenient time which suits most of us.

So, it is fixed.

Sunday, 29 June 2008
India Coffee House, MG Road

Waiting to see you all.

Regards,
Hari

All,

FYI, We are close to 102 members on the mailing list and I got 10 response's? in total for the below email.

Its time to plan our meet and take the first step towards creating a revolution :) 

Based on my experiences with the other groups I am involved with, I recommend that we have our first meeting on a Sunday morning. The reason I am suggesting is that you will not have traffic problems and it would be a peaceful drive no matter from which part of the city you are coming in and you will DEFINITELY get parking space. 

I do not know where each one is located except for a few. Hence I suggest we meet at India Coffee House (ICH), on MG Road. This is just beside Deccan Herald office. This is a very old coffee house and breakfast should not go over Rs.30 (Including coffee). After we have our first meeting, we can plan going forward. 

Will the coming Sunday (29 June) morning 9 AM suit all of us? 

Regards,
Hari

All,

It has really been long time since the OWASP-Bangalore Chapter went into hibernation. With the growing demand and need to application security, I think this group should start being more pro-active and work towards building the community stronger. 

Over the last few days, I have been personally receiving calls and inquiries as to what is happening at the chapter and when in the next meeting and other general questions. 

Can we start being active? Why don't we plan for a meeting and then chalk out a plan for going forward. 

Regards,
Hari

Hi List,
I'm trying to find a list of pentesting/security services companies in
Bangalore. 
Searched the web but did not find anything useful. If there is no such
one place where this info can be found, would appreciate if you can give
me names of the companies (including startups) that you know of.
 
Thanks,
 
-Jitesh

Hi,

Was great to meet you guys today. While Hari posts the MoMs, I thought
I'd put up the Security Camp wiki link in the meanwhile -
