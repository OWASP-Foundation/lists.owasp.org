HI Swaroop,

I am not sure if OWASP will answers for creating a security spec document.

I googled for "creating a security specification document", which gave me
some interesting results. Maybe you want to try that?

Maybe you also want to try the null mailing list as this goes beyond
Application Security and researchers there might have more to add.

Do share what you find with us here on this list as well.

Thank you.

Hi Swaroop,
You also might want to look at OWASP ASVS(Application Security verification specifications) that provides a list of security requirements that need to be part of an application/product based on which the maturity level of that application/prd can be quantified.

However, this is more for a web application security, please check if it also helps on network related product.

Thanks,
Satish

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] SourceNAT IP to be in scope for Scanning or not?
Message-ID: <CAO_7Mb3SR3cAeivzPcpiNSDR+8eb4KscxvpbwBgv9cf-_p-s=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am unable to come to a conclusion to say the sourceNAT IP of a firewall
should be covered or in-scope for vulnerability scanning.

I get to hear from my network team that firewall managment IP is already
covered to find issues related to Firewall, having source NAT IP included
inscope does not make any sense.

I do agree to them for certain extent that scanning source NAT IP from
external perspective does not fetch any results or may be I could be wrong?
However, I feel there should be a scan performed atleast internally.

Kindly, help me clearing my query.

thank you for the response, so scanning NAT IP from external source doesn't
make a sense. It is good idea to scan only from internal source, correct?
