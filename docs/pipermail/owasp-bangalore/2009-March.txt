Guys,

Please use mailing list for any discussions. SMS Channel will become a spam
engine otherwise. SMS channel should only be used to announce events or any
special notices (like last moment changes in venue etc).

Sundar, is there any setting to restrict that only you(the owner) could send
messages using the channel.

Thanks and appreciate it,
-Sumit

As sunder asked the topic for next meet, I am a php dev more concering about
secure applications. I propose to on "*php web application and protecting it
from hackers*". I hope it sounds good and awaiting for consent from all of
you.

By the way, This will be my second owasp bangalore meet after attending it
accidently at yahoo and was shocked that this security group exists in
bangalore as well. I was expecting to be part of this kind of group since a
long.

Any how, what you think about the topic ? Also let me know, if you want me
to cover anything specific in this presentation?

Regards
*Jayesh*

Apologies for the mobile spam, seems to be sending the messages multiple
times.
As of now I have given broadcast permissions to all members , however we
shall use this
only for important announcements to prevent spam.As far as possible use the
mailing list.
And I guess we could plan our next meet on Apr 12th due to short of time.
from the coming month we have it the 1`st Sunday recurring every month.

Sundar.

Akash,

Leaders,

The Global Projects Committee is in the process of improving the OWASP
Project structure by determining orphaned projects, updating and
augmenting the existing project criteria, and reclassifying projects
to help users find OWASP Projects that are relevant and important to
them. To that end, we have sent out a Project Update survey to all
OWASP Project Owners to fill out before April 1st, 2009.

In addition, we would like to give the OWASP Community the opportunity
to provide feedback for any particular OWASP Project.

If there's a particular project that you enjoy using or have some
suggestions for, please fill out the feedback form here:
https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=cEp6TlUxeU5KZDdXaTdlNk5PRUgxWVE6MA
..

Please keep feedback constructive and note that all feedback will be
made public.

Feel free to share this feedback form with other OWASP Community
members, OWASP Project users, etc.

You can read more about the Global Project Committee's efforts here:

Is there any public URL you can share where this CAPTCHA is running?

Also you can look at these two links.
1. http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha // A list of different CAPTCHA
implementations and their weaknesses
2. http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/gimpy/ // More like a research
paper, interesting nonetheless

Hope This Helps.

Hi *sundar and all owasp members*,

I have listed the topic on devcamp.in "Protecting Web Application (PHP &
MySQL) From Hackers and Making Data and Application Secure (OWASP Meet)" as
from mailing list I came to know that this time meet will be on DevCamp at
ThoughtWorks.

I have updated the session topic at
http://devcamp.in/wiki/DevCamp_Bangalore_2_Sessions

I trust, all member of OWASP will like the session.

If you have anything special to cover in the topic, if you are facing any
issue in web application security, I would try to focus more on those
specific points. So your inputs are welcomed.

Regards
*Jayesh*, Paxaal Inc
Bangalore, India
