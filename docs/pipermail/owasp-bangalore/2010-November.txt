It is widely recognized that Information Technology and applied research in
Computer Science will play an increasingly vital role in business and
industry. This is particularly true in the area of information management
and knowledge services. There has been an explosive growth of digital
content and handheld devices and vast networks of sensors have become
ubiquitous. As a result of these developments, massive amounts of data and
information are becoming available for numerical and symbolic processing and
analysis. This information is a virtual goldmine for society, government and
industry, but the task of extracting, analyzing and storing relevant
information and making it available to the right user (or application) at
the right time poses formidable technological challenges, many of which
remain unsolved. The COMPUTE 2011 has  brings together researchers,
practitioners and technology market movers in order to advance the state of
the art and practice in computer science research as it applies to these
technological challenges and to help bridge the digital divide.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Microsoft Network Transfer Module Over HTTPS SQL
	Injection
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTi=QDwyGAv9xX3hs2G55CbsfqRwUfc3qf9wKV+C3@mail.gmail.com>
References: <AANLkTi=QDwyGAv9xX3hs2G55CbsfqRwUfc3qf9wKV+C3@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <AANLkTika9w0o5R8P=Hu3EcqnzGb=iNd8NtNjhPahtyE1@mail.gmail.com>

Microsoft network uses transfer file module over HTTPS which is a part of
internal FTM process. This module was prone to input injection scenario and
reflected errors shown the high possibility of SQL injection. The error
leveraged lot of potential information about module which could be used to
exploit the inherent functionality of FTM. Primarily, it can be fuzzed more
intensively by generating false metadata combination which can be passed as
an input to FTM.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] NoScript (2.0.5.1 < less ) - Bypass "Reflective
 XSS" through Union SQL Poisoning Trick (SQLXSSI)

Hi List

NoScript fails to detect the reflective XSS from trusted domains when an
attack is conducted through SQLXSSI. The bypass in NoScript has been
successfully conducted by using "Reflective XSS" through Union SQL
poisoning attacks by exploiting the reverted errors in the browser. The
attack string used to bypass is stated below

http://www.example.com/news.php?news=12%27union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,0x3c7363726970743e616c657274282f73636861702f293c2f7363726970743e,9,10,11,12,version%28%29%20from%20tbl_news--<http://www.example.com/news.php?news=12%27union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,0x3c7363726970743e616c657274282f73636861702f293c2f7363726970743e,9,10,11,12,version%28%29%20from%20tbl_news--+>

The attacker can create a potential attack patterns using the above stated
vector.

The exploitation video has been released at SecNiche Security channel -
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-kgKNspqjQ

Disclosure: The bug was disclosed to the author on 24th November 2010. A
new version of NoScript 2.0.6 is released today (25th November 2010).
Further, NoScript 2.0.6 version fails to combat against this attack vector
and can be bypassed with the same.
