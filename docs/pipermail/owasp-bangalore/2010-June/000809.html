<PRE>As members of OWASP, this webinar might not be for you - as you already know
about the importance of security in web-applications - but what about
getting others involved? Ever wanted to get your Program Managers a little
more familiar with the principals of secure coding? How about QA or the
Architects?  And what about the Team Leads and certainly the new Developers
who you'll be working beside.

 

Why not suggest that they attend a webinar specifically tailored for them.

About This 45-Minute Webinar

You will hear that application security is a &quot;finger-pointing&quot; blame game.
Traditional Security staff claim that it's the responsibility of the
Developers.  Developers say security is not mandated in the design specs.
And, Program Managers think security has to do with patches and virus
scanners. No one seems to know who is responsible - and typically, no one
steps up and takes responsibility. 

This webinar will explore how to change all of this through a three-tiered
approach - Awareness, Training, and Education. Depending on your role within
the SDLC, you have some responsibilities for security - but to what extent
is determined by various factors. Some may just need to be familiar with the
fundamentals of secure coding, while others may need in-depth training -
while even others may want a formalized education and possibly receive
certification of their skills and knowledge.
