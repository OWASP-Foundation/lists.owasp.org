<PRE>Hopefully this presentation will discuss the following:
 
- Responsibility for Application Security as described in SAMM vs what
this speaker may state as a different answer
- Industry analyst research that he thinks does a particularly good job
of answering this question
- How much training is enough? Are cheaper forms of training such as
couple hour webinars sufficient

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Who is responsible for Application Security
inthe SDLC?



As members of OWASP, this webinar might not be for you - as you already
know about the importance of security in web-applications - but what
about getting others involved? Ever wanted to get your Program Managers
a little more familiar with the principals of secure coding? How about
QA or the Architects?  And what about the Team Leads and certainly the
new Developers who you'll be working beside.

 

Why not suggest that they attend a webinar specifically tailored for
them.

About This 45-Minute Webinar

You will hear that application security is a &quot;finger-pointing&quot; blame
game.  Traditional Security staff claim that it's the responsibility of
the Developers.  Developers say security is not mandated in the design
specs.  And, Program Managers think security has to do with patches and
virus scanners. No one seems to know who is responsible - and typically,
no one steps up and takes responsibility. 

This webinar will explore how to change all of this through a
three-tiered approach - Awareness, Training, and Education. Depending on
your role within the SDLC, you have some responsibilities for security -
but to what extent is determined by various factors. Some may just need
to be familiar with the fundamentals of secure coding, while others may
need in-depth training - while even others may want a formalized
education and possibly receive certification of their skills and
knowledge.
