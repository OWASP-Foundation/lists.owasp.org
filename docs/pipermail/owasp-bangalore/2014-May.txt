Message-ID: <CAO_7Mb3H49qUbdWEw11Wn0OxuipMZHovyRpFTGi9imCiqTLAqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I had been struggling to give a business justification to my application
owners about application pen test timelines.

We usually quote 2 weeks of application pen test time for any major
releases and new applications.
Our application owners has a constraint for 2 weeks of pen testing time for
getting their applications live.

They understand security risk and get the application tested by squeezing
the timelines to a week or so. And they also aware of risks imposed by
squeezing pen test timeline. However, they have a valid justification for
their own application releases which are frequent every month or so.

What is the best security solution that we can provide to them? They also
take examples of Ebay or other big sites how do they manage security
testing of applications for which they will push updates every overnight?

Any possible process/procedure/solutions/suggestions are welcome.

Hi Raju,

Here is what we do in our organization, we do run a full scan of the application on Pre-production environments(which are similar to the live or production environments).
Once the full scan/Full testing is done, we are aware of the application behavior from there on its only the patches or small defect changes in the code or the functionality.
You could probably test the delta(change in functionality/code) which would take much less than a week which would inturn help the application team to concentrate on the release every fortnight. 

Please let me know if it helps. 

Thanks & Regards

Thank you all for your valuable responses.

To conclude from various responses I have few data points collected and
listed in below;

*1. Follow Risk Based Approach - For the security issues that app team
cannot fix in stipulated time-frame. Let the app team release the app with
accepting the risks however, take confirmation from the team to have the
fix release in future releases. We do have an exemption process for High,
Medium.*

*2. Delta Testing - For new releases only test for the changes between the
gaps. If it seems to be huge application - test for the delta only on
sensitive interfaces. And again follow the Risk based approach on gaps
which were not covered.*

*3. Having more resources*

*4. Automating application testing *

*5. And reduce documentation*

Message-ID: <CADRqLtTNixH8GqGLAEinNfBcyRtWvsYa2BhkEfntJmVSMQbeRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Guys,

I have a small confusion, CSRF Token is used to make sure that the request
is generated for the same domain right and CSRF tokens are generated
dynamically for each request. Am I right on this?

In that case what are the disadvantages/impact of having CSRF token created
once during a log in and the same token is used through out the session.

Thanks in advance! :)

The whole idea of having the CSRF token is to have a unique identifier per request so that the requests are not forged. That is the reason that every request should have a fresh token. If it is a single token for a session then there is no reason that we should have one at all, the session itself would have sufficed.

Project Announcements

Open Source Showcase

The AppSec EU Conference Team is happy to announce that there will be ten
projects participating in this year?s Open Source Showcase at AppSec EU
this summer. The Open Source Showcase is an unique event module that allows
project leaders and/or project contributors to showcase their work in a
demo setting and gain exposure for their projects without to conduct a full
session. The Showcase affords a more personal view of project between
attendees.

Throughout the conference, these project will be demoing at the Open Source
Showcase space within the conference venue. Join us at the Open Source
Showcase June 23-26. Demo times to be announced closer to the conference.

See you in Cambridge!

interact with software defect tracking systems.

Project Summit

We are just a little over a month away from AppSec EU and the 2014 Project
Summit. So far we have some great projects signed up to participate, but we
need more projects participating. The Project Summit is a fantastic
opportunity to workshop your project and gather new volunteers for your
project. The Project Summit will be taking place June 23-24 Anglia Ruskin
University in Cambridge, UK and is free and open to the Community. You do
not need a conference pass to attend the Project Summit. Don?t have a
project? No problem, we can still use your help at the Project Summit. Sign

OWASP STING Game
Project<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/9ae0b3ebce>

The OWASP STING Game Project is a card game in downloadable format or if
funded, printed and distributed at OWASP events.

STING is a combative card game in the style of Magic the Gathering designed
to teach application security attack and defense. Players will
simultaneously attack other players apps while defending their own and
supporting game business objectives.

For more information, please contact the Project Leader, Tony Turner

OWASP GoatDroid<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/dc356840fd>

OWASP GoatDroid is a fully functional and self-contained training
environment for educating developers and testers on Android security.
GoatDroid requires minimal dependencies and is ideal for both Android
beginners as well as more advanced users. The project currently includes
two applications: FourGoats, a location-based social network, and Herd
Financial, a mobile banking application. There are also several feature
that greatly simplify usage within a training environment or for absolute
beginners who want a good introduction to working with the Android platform.

For more information, please contact the Project Leader, Jack Mannino
New OWASP Projects

OWASP PHP Security Training Project

The goal of this project is to create an interactive training system,
consisting of several units, for PHP developers. Every unit is divided in
an attack and a defense part. For more information, please contact the
Project Leader, Timo Pagel. <timo.pagel at owasp.org>

OWASP Hardened Phalcon Project

The Phalcon Framework is the world's fastest PHP Framework, however, like
most frameworks it is not 'hardened' by default. OWASP Hardened Phalcon
aims to help developers harden their Phalcon applications in-line with the
published OWASP guidelines. For more information, please contact the
Project Leader, Rhodry Korb. <rhodry.korb at owasp.org>

        [image: communication]  OWASP Committees 2.0

OWASP is an organization that has been built on collaboration and community
involvement. I also hope that OWASP is an organization that can support and
innovation - encouraging the community to try new things and be willing to
look frequently and assess what is working and what isn't.

We have grown to the point where an improved process needs to be
implemented where our leaders can lead and those who wish to participate
can do so easily and productively.

In 2008, the Foundation created committees. These committees were
successful in that they pushed forward some much needed guidelines and put
some structure around areas that were undefined.

Unfortunately, over time, there were built in flaws with the committee
design that created roadblocks and eventually their failure.

We would like to propose a revamped committee structure based on a solid
foundation that provides the voice and opportunities to the community. This
structure will depend on a high level of community engagement.

Wiki page outlining structure for the committees
2.0<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7c4dfa1834/0307c7c15a/a154140b71>

Most importantly - We want your input! not just leaders, or individuals
with an owasp.org email, anyone in the community is encouraged to
participate in this poll of both the general idea of the committees 2.0 and
particular features of the new model. Participate

*Let's see who has the fastest solution this week ...*

Five pirates have obtained 100 gold coins and have to divide up the loot.
The pirates are all extremely intelligent, treacherous and selfish
(especially the captain). The captain always proposes a distribution of the
loot. All pirates vote on the proposal, and if half the crew or more go
"Aye", the loot is divided as proposed, as no pirate would be willing to
take on the captain without superior force on their side. If the captain
fails to obtain support of at least half his crew (which includes himself),
he faces a mutiny, and all pirates will turn against him and make him walk
the plank. The pirates start over again with the next senior pirate as
captain.

What is the maximum number of coins the captain can keep without risking
his life?
