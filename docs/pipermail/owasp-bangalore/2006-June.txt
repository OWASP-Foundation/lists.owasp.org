Welcome to the group. Sadly there are just a few of us and have just
met once AFAIK.
If you would like to, please introduce yourself and your primary
interest in joining the group.
If you have any queries  (technical / non technical ) just ask as
people including me are nice and friendly.

:) Thanks Akash,guyz, you ppl are a cool bunch. BTW do we yet have a
venue and timing for this saturday's meeting.

My DaVinci:
Hi all this is Nikun. I am a C|EH certified and CISSP aspirant, and a
seasoned Sys Admin & Security guy. I have been working into Network and
Systems security for quite a long time now. My areas of interest are IM
threats, spwares/adwares/malware (I call it SAM), systems security
(Linux/windows) and networks security (IDS, IDDS, IPS, Firewalls and
other layer 3 devices).

But unfortunately I haven't been much good at Application security, and
this is one of the reasons for joining this group. The other reason
being, I have been looking out for a geek ;) bunch to hang out with on
my weekends.

I hope I am gonna learn something from here and be able to contribute
something back to the community.

I am also the founder of the W&D community, a small group of CEH'ers,
basically an unofficial C|EH user group

I like to work in close confined circles and don't prefer going public.
Neither me nor my work.

Umm.. there's a lot I could talk about my work, but I would prefer to
stand back and wait until I am asked to. At least until I am more
familiar with the group.

Geee guys, sorry for such a long Da Vinci :-D.

-Nikun

Good I have been looking for the same too. If you are somewhere around
koramangala we can definitely meet up. Doesn't even have to be a full
blown OWASP meeting.

Hi all,
   Sounds gr8 from all the mails.. 
   Hari where you? .. Those who don't know Hari, let me introduce him.
He is the one who started the Bangalore chapter of OWASP. I am surprised
why he is not sending any mails 

We can definitely arrange for the second meeting of Bangalore OWASP
chapter this or next Saturday.

Hi All / Cherian,
    Let me tell you one thing frankly, I will be really happy if we all
conduct the meeting on the coming or next Saturday. I am sure that there
won't be more than 5 people. In the first meeting we expect around 8 but
only 3 were there. 

What I suggest is instead of going to a formal planning and all, it
would be better if all (those who are currently in this mail thread)
make sure to attend the Saturday's meeting and we will discuss about how
we have to drive the Bangalore chapter effectively. First at least let
the people meet. 

Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)   

Thanks & Regards,
    Deepson Thomas

Its a vicious circle. People want to meet to kick start but most back
out in the end because not enough people are there to kick start. I
guess if we start using the mailing list a bit more effectively in the
sense increase the traffic here with the kind of topics we would like
to discuss. I know of two people here who would like to start
experimenting and learning about new ways of hacking and the
techniques to securing.

> Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)

Let the doubts, experiences etc. with OWASP tools and the top 10 list
start flowing.
What about the agenda. Its your meeting too. What would you like to
discuss in the meet.
Tell everyone about any great paper / tool / trick you learned which
can help someone else.

Also larger issues like is Bangalore too small a community to really
stand out. Maybe we should have a OWASP India. Something of the things
can and should be discussed over email.

I am personally interested in learning about web application security.
My CEH knowledge didn't cover enough for me to be sure about it.
Specifically I have been learning about SQL Injection on the web and
found many Indian websites vulnerable. I am not sure how to proceed
and inform the admins without looking culpable. There have been cases
of researchers being charged in the US. Maybe as a OWASP BLR or OWASP
India community we can educate and inform people about such issues.

The point is there can be many agendas everyone has the trick is to
find out a few which we all have in common and start working towards
them.

Sincere apologies over the long email.

Hi All,

I am new to this team and also to the space of Web App Security.
Nevertheless, I am keen in understanding this space and exploring it
further.

I second what Akash mentioned. While it's a great idea to meet, lets
initiate more value packed discussion on the mailing list itself so that
we automatically derive an appropriate agenda and a premise to conduct a
formal meeting.

Regards,
- Ranjith

In related information OWASP - Mumbai just had their first meeting on
24th. I guess the difference there is that its more company driven.
All the three presenters were from various security companies and the
space also was provided by one company.

Hi all,
   Sounds gr8 from all the mails.. 
   Hari where you? .. Those who don't know Hari, let me introduce him.
He is the one who started the Bangalore chapter of OWASP. I am surprised
why he is not sending any mails 

We can definitely arrange for the second meeting of Bangalore OWASP
chapter this or next Saturday.

Hi All / Cherian,
    Let me tell you one thing frankly, I will be really happy if we all
conduct the meeting on the coming or next Saturday. I am sure that there
won't be more than 5 people. In the first meeting we expect around 8 but
only 3 were there. 

What I suggest is instead of going to a formal planning and all, it
would be better if all (those who are currently in this mail thread)
make sure to attend the Saturday's meeting and we will discuss about how
we have to drive the Bangalore chapter effectively. First at least let
the people meet. 

Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)   

Thanks & Regards,
    Deepson Thomas

Its a vicious circle. People want to meet to kick start but most back
out in the end because not enough people are there to kick start. I
guess if we start using the mailing list a bit more effectively in the
sense increase the traffic here with the kind of topics we would like
to discuss. I know of two people here who would like to start
experimenting and learning about new ways of hacking and the
techniques to securing.

> Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)

Let the doubts, experiences etc. with OWASP tools and the top 10 list
start flowing.
What about the agenda. Its your meeting too. What would you like to
discuss in the meet.
Tell everyone about any great paper / tool / trick you learned which
can help someone else.

Also larger issues like is Bangalore too small a community to really
stand out. Maybe we should have a OWASP India. Something of the things
can and should be discussed over email.

I am personally interested in learning about web application security.
My CEH knowledge didn't cover enough for me to be sure about it.
Specifically I have been learning about SQL Injection on the web and
found many Indian websites vulnerable. I am not sure how to proceed
and inform the admins without looking culpable. There have been cases
of researchers being charged in the US. Maybe as a OWASP BLR or OWASP
India community we can educate and inform people about such issues.

The point is there can be many agendas everyone has the trick is to
find out a few which we all have in common and start working towards
them.

Sincere apologies over the long email.

regards
akash

Guyz I think, instead of trying to work up an agenda and a formal
meeting, we should just meet. Just for the heck of it, just for fun.
This is not a business meeting to worry about agenda. Lets just meet and
have fun. Some fun things we can try in our meeting is

-Wifi sniffing and hacking.
-hacking into each others machines, as we all will be there on network.
-compete with each other to see who can stuff the most no. of burgers
and coffee into the hard disk.
-if somebody wants to talk about some hacking techniques, tips and
tricks then they can do it. (ahmed sir, you listening?, its compulsory
for you ! :-D )
-and finally I think we can use the occasion to get out of our dingy
dens glittering with the lights from comps and cpu's, and watch some
beautiful girls and see how far evolution has leaped while we were in
there.


My 2 cents, what say you pordner?

Nikun

Hi All / Cherian,
    Let me tell you one thing frankly, I will be really happy if we all
conduct the meeting on the coming or next Saturday. I am sure that there
won't be more than 5 people. In the first meeting we expect around 8 but
only 3 were there. 

What I suggest is instead of going to a formal planning and all, it
would be better if all (those who are currently in this mail thread)
make sure to attend the Saturday's meeting and we will discuss about how
we have to drive the Bangalore chapter effectively. First at least let
the people meet. 

Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)   

Thanks & Regards,
    Deepson Thomas

Its a vicious circle. People want to meet to kick start but most back
out in the end because not enough people are there to kick start. I
guess if we start using the mailing list a bit more effectively in the
sense increase the traffic here with the kind of topics we would like
to discuss. I know of two people here who would like to start
experimenting and learning about new ways of hacking and the
techniques to securing.

> Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)

Let the doubts, experiences etc. with OWASP tools and the top 10 list
start flowing.
What about the agenda. Its your meeting too. What would you like to
discuss in the meet.
Tell everyone about any great paper / tool / trick you learned which
can help someone else.

Also larger issues like is Bangalore too small a community to really
stand out. Maybe we should have a OWASP India. Something of the things
can and should be discussed over email.

I am personally interested in learning about web application security.
My CEH knowledge didn't cover enough for me to be sure about it.
Specifically I have been learning about SQL Injection on the web and
found many Indian websites vulnerable. I am not sure how to proceed
and inform the admins without looking culpable. There have been cases
of researchers being charged in the US. Maybe as a OWASP BLR or OWASP
India community we can educate and inform people about such issues.

The point is there can be many agendas everyone has the trick is to
find out a few which we all have in common and start working towards
them.

Sincere apologies over the long email.

regards
akash

Guyz I think, instead of trying to work up an agenda and a formal
meeting, we should just meet. Just for the heck of it, just for fun.
This is not a business meeting to worry about agenda. Lets just meet and
have fun. Some fun things we can try in our meeting is

-Wifi sniffing and hacking.
-hacking into each others machines, as we all will be there on network.
-compete with each other to see who can stuff the most no. of burgers
and coffee into the hard disk.
-if somebody wants to talk about some hacking techniques, tips and
tricks then they can do it. (ahmed sir, you listening?, its compulsory
for you ! :-D )
-and finally I think we can use the occasion to get out of our dingy
dens glittering with the lights from comps and cpu's, and watch some
beautiful girls and see how far evolution has leaped while we were in
there.


My 2 cents, what say you pordner?

Guyz I think, instead of trying to work up an agenda and a formal
meeting, we should just meet. Just for the heck of it, just for fun.
This is not a business meeting to worry about agenda. Lets just meet and
have fun. Some fun things we can try in our meeting is

-Wifi sniffing and hacking.
-hacking into each others machines, as we all will be there on network.
-compete with each other to see who can stuff the most no. of burgers
and coffee into the hard disk.
-if somebody wants to talk about some hacking techniques, tips and
tricks then they can do it. (ahmed sir, you listening?, its compulsory
for you ! :-D )
-and finally I think we can use the occasion to get out of our dingy
dens glittering with the lights from comps and cpu's, and watch some
beautiful girls and see how far evolution has leaped while we were in
there.


My 2 cents, what say you pordner?

Nikun

   Hari where you? .. Those who don't know Hari, let me introduce him.
He is the one who started the Bangalore chapter of OWASP. I am surprised

Hi All / Cherian,
    Let me tell you one thing frankly, I will be really happy if we all
conduct the meeting on the coming or next Saturday. I am sure that there
won't be more than 5 people. In the first meeting we expect around 8 but
only 3 were there. 

What I suggest is instead of going to a formal planning and all, it
would be better if all (those who are currently in this mail thread)
make sure to attend the Saturday's meeting and we will discuss about how
we have to drive the Bangalore chapter effectively. First at least let
the people meet. 

Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)   

Thanks & Regards,
    Deepson Thomas

Its a vicious circle. People want to meet to kick start but most back
out in the end because not enough people are there to kick start. I
guess if we start using the mailing list a bit more effectively in the
sense increase the traffic here with the kind of topics we would like to
discuss. I know of two people here who would like to start experimenting
and learning about new ways of hacking and the techniques to securing.

> Suggestions and comments are mostly welcome :)

Let the doubts, experiences etc. with OWASP tools and the top 10 list
start flowing.
What about the agenda. Its your meeting too. What would you like to
discuss in the meet.
Tell everyone about any great paper / tool / trick you learned which can
help someone else.

Also larger issues like is Bangalore too small a community to really
stand out. Maybe we should have a OWASP India. Something of the things
can and should be discussed over email.

I am personally interested in learning about web application security.
My CEH knowledge didn't cover enough for me to be sure about it.
Specifically I have been learning about SQL Injection on the web and
found many Indian websites vulnerable. I am not sure how to proceed and
inform the admins without looking culpable. There have been cases of
researchers being charged in the US. Maybe as a OWASP BLR or OWASP India
community we can educate and inform people about such issues.

The point is there can be many agendas everyone has the trick is to find
out a few which we all have in common and start working towards them.

Sincere apologies over the long email.

akash

Hi Akash & list members,

While I am away from Bangalore updates, but very keen to particiapte in the
discussions. I just had an informal mail session with Nikun. Infact Akash,
you have just peneed down my wish to have a OWASP India. By the way, is it
not there already (Sorry I didnt google it) ? and if its not, then we
definitely can have it. as fasr as my experience goe, there ARE many many
Indians and Indian companies doing nice stuffs in Secueity especially
AppSecurity.

Still, till the time that doesnt happen, let us start sharing our
experiences and have some good discussions?

Since Akash you have mentioned about SQL injection...and also, there was an
earlier mail discussing on SQL injection, let me start with my doubt on this
topic..

Looking from an IDS/IPS perspective, what do you feel abuot usefulness of a
generic signature, capturing all paterns, designed with the now popular PCRE
expressions? I am referring to the article at
http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1768

If one visits latest CVE threats at NVD site
http://nvd.nist.gov/  and do advanced search for high, remote vulnerabilites
in June 2006,
you'll find many SQl Injection and XSS vulnerabilites.....this could also be
attributed due to many applictions rapidly developed and usage of those
applications in some other sites (particularly forums, discussion boards
etc)....so Akash, this seems to be a behavior of not only Indian sites but
many  others...

I am not sure how to proceed

You are correct Akash, there have been many quoted cases. I think there is a
hidden protocol which is mostly followed in Security industry where the
security researcher informs to the vendor about the vulnerability and until
its patched its not quoted publicly. Another way is to report the
vulnerability to sites like NVD where they ask one to write a mail. But I
really dont know when is this reporting done, prior to informing the vendor
or afterwards...since we are actually informing to a standard bodies.....I
will try look into the issue..as its interesting one and imp to follow
up....

Nothing much to write as of now...
I think CEH is becoming quite popular these days, right? What do you guys
feel?

Yah generic regular expressions have been the fore-fathers of IDS's. As
a sys admin I have found and used regular expressions for basic log
analysis and security incident detection for years. Sql injection, xss
scripting and related hacking techniques on the other hand have leaped
bounds in complexity over the years. Today the two major factors
affecting an IDS approval from management includes (but not limited to)

1. Percentage of human intervention required: which has to stay as
minimum as possible.
2. Intelligence and smartness in avoiding false positives: which has to
stay as maximum as possible.

That said: 

1. Even putting aside management approval requirements, basic regular
expressions, not fine tuned to avoid false positives, can create false
alarms in the magnitude of around "18000 tip-offs on an average" on a
normal day. I have known of days when it has reached figures of upto
50000+. Imagine how much man hours would go into filtering them. 
2. If you are deploying an IDS, you probably want to consider the
network and CPU resource/bandwidth allocatable to it. With such sheer
amount of false positives, you run the risk of DOS'ng your own server
and affecting your "genuine-alert" visibility. (Not to mention spamming
up your mail box until your managers mails start bouncing back, and he
bumps into your cabin with a shot gun ;-) )
3. The most important point. Re-visiting the "genuine-alert" visibility
stated above. The complexity of todays SI and XSS attacks, clubbed with
automated attacks, are giving rise to worms, SAM (spyware, adware,
malware) and botter which can spread into million computers and run
automated attacks of huge magnitude. This initiates a twister in your
office, the wide top of which lies at the VP's, P's and VIP's, and the
singular bottom point of which lies on poor you. The next moment you
know you are dragging your ass and burning your midnight fuel to wade
off these attacks.  The intruder takes this opportunity to enter your
network, complete his evil intentions and leave without a trace, because
you are too busy to see him and the log servers are already overflowing.
"Diversion at its evil best".

So personally I think generic generalized regular expressions is good
enough to minimize missed alerts but brings home a lot of negative
security issues too. Its more of a trade off between effectiveness and
accountability. 

One thought though: You can write regexp's to detect SI/XSS for
obfuscation done via using hex codes, as can be seen in the article, how
would you do it for obfuscation done via UNICODE, you cant just write
regexp's due to the sheer amount of alternatives available?

I would be very careful with the Regexp's I tie into my IDS ...

No comments. But I would like to mention here, CEH can get you the base
clear if you want to learn hacking.

My 2 cents

Do you remember FOSS.IN Rasmus gave a lecture on this. He has created
a simple php tool to automate the checking for XSS.

OOB: Out of Band access. This is a form of backup access mechanism you
will find on servers inside data centers, where physical access is not
always possible for SA's. This is kinda alternate communication channel
that lets you see your box from bootup and troubleshoot if the OS
crashes and wont boot. Kind of remote terminal which is equivalent to
local console. 

In the hackers jargoan, OOB access can refer to any method of
communication that allows to bypass major security enforced doors into a
network. For example, you might have your DMZ 4 layer hardened with IPS
and firewalls, VPN's with IPSEC and God knows what. But you have a
dialup modem pool specifically for the stupid managers so that they can
log into their office machine to check mail !!! , because they find OWA
complex to use. A hacker only needs to social engineer the manager or
wardial the modem pool and WALLAH ! he is inside your network, suddenly
seems all the millions you spend on the security infra would have rather
been spent on paying higher bonus to the poor SA's.

This kind of alternate access is very deadly from security point of
view. The major culprit in this category can be the public IM usage
inside the network. The hacker makes a phony girl screen name, convinces
the clerk guy to chat with him, what do you know the next moment the
hacker has a trojan inside your network and is digging out instead of
digging in. No firewalls, no IPS, no nothing, its easier for him to
break out then break in.

I can list couple of such OOB access available to a hacker, I am still
working on the list creating papers for each one I can think of. If you
can think of something more please let me know:
1. exposed ethernet cables. The ones you see dangling down the wall or
running over the ground ( like behind banks ;-) ).
2. Improperly implemented Wireless AP's
3. Public IM and Mail usage inside private networks.
4. Social engineering: I know this is a vast field, but I am only
referring to the situations where say, you leave a mp3 player look-alike
usb memory stick, with a Trojan, on the ground, near the entrance door,
and the first employee to see it takes and happily plugs it into the
office system (Do you remember "Curiosity is by far the biggest killer
of crows !!! :-D ")
5. Dial-up modem pools. (often the most neglected in terms of security
hardening, not the SA guyz fault really, how many security devices or
technologies do you find in the market that are targeted for modem
pools?)
6. Data storage and computer devices that are allowed to be taken
outside the company. IPOD's, laptops, memory sticks, camera's (yes
camera's too), audio/video CD's, PDA's etc etc.
7. Like pumba would tell timon .. ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON
AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON....

:-D

Thankyou,
Nikun

affecting an IDS approval from management includes (but not limited to)

1. Percentage of human intervention required: which has to stay as
minimum as possible.
2. Intelligence and smartness in avoiding false positives: which has to
stay as maximum as possible.

That said: 

1. Even putting aside management approval requirements, basic regular
expressions, not fine tuned to avoid false positives, can create false
alarms in the magnitude of around "18000 tip-offs on an average" on a
normal day. I have known of days when it has reached figures of upto
50000+. Imagine how much man hours would go into filtering them. 
2. If you are deploying an IDS, you probably want to consider the
network and CPU resource/bandwidth allocatable to it. With such sheer
amount of false positives, you run the risk of DOS'ng your own server
and affecting your "genuine-alert" visibility. (Not to mention spamming
up your mail box until your managers mails start bouncing back, and he
bumps into your cabin with a shot gun ;-) )
3. The most important point. Re-visiting the "genuine-alert" visibility
stated above. The complexity of todays SI and XSS attacks, clubbed with
automated attacks, are giving rise to worms, SAM (spyware, adware,
malware) and botter which can spread into million computers and run
automated attacks of huge magnitude. This initiates a twister in your
office, the wide top of which lies at the VP's, P's and VIP's, and the
singular bottom point of which lies on poor you. The next moment you
know you are dragging your ass and burning your midnight fuel to wade
off these attacks.  The intruder takes this opportunity to enter your
network, complete his evil intentions and leave without a trace, because
you are too busy to see him and the log servers are already overflowing.
"Diversion at its evil best".

So personally I think generic generalized regular expressions is good
enough to minimize missed alerts but brings home a lot of negative
security issues too. Its more of a trade off between effectiveness and
accountability. 

One thought though: You can write regexp's to detect SI/XSS for
obfuscation done via using hex codes, as can be seen in the article, how
would you do it for obfuscation done via UNICODE, you cant just write
regexp's due to the sheer amount of alternatives available?

I would be very careful with the Regexp's I tie into my IDS ...

No comments. But I would like to mention here, CEH can get you the base
clear if you want to learn hacking.

My 2 cents

Hi Guyz,
I am compiling a research paper for exploitable vulnerabilities with
instant messengers (not website, only IM ... client side) like yahoo,
hotmail, gmail, LCS, sametime, jabber and stuff like that. Does anybody
have some good references, urls or papers regarding them. Is anybody
working actively in this field? 

This paper is an episode from a series of papers which talk about
alternative entry points for hackers. ummm.. Something like OOB
access :-)

Thankyou,

Do you remember FOSS.IN Rasmus gave a lecture on this. He has created

I know someone working on finding weakness in yahoo IM. But he doesn't
really like to share.
Lets see what I can find on this.

Can you elaborate what is OOB access ?

OOB: Out of Band access. This is a form of backup access mechanism you
will find on servers inside data centers, where physical access is not
always possible for SA's. This is kinda alternate communication channel
that lets you see your box from bootup and troubleshoot if the OS
crashes and wont boot. Kind of remote terminal which is equivalent to
local console. 

In the hackers jargoan, OOB access can refer to any method of
communication that allows to bypass major security enforced doors into a
network. For example, you might have your DMZ 4 layer hardened with IPS
and firewalls, VPN's with IPSEC and God knows what. But you have a
dialup modem pool specifically for the stupid managers so that they can
log into their office machine to check mail !!! , because they find OWA
complex to use. A hacker only needs to social engineer the manager or
wardial the modem pool and WALLAH ! he is inside your network, suddenly
seems all the millions you spend on the security infra would have rather
been spent on paying higher bonus to the poor SA's.

This kind of alternate access is very deadly from security point of
view. The major culprit in this category can be the public IM usage
inside the network. The hacker makes a phony girl screen name, convinces
the clerk guy to chat with him, what do you know the next moment the
hacker has a trojan inside your network and is digging out instead of
digging in. No firewalls, no IPS, no nothing, its easier for him to
break out then break in.

I can list couple of such OOB access available to a hacker, I am still
working on the list creating papers for each one I can think of. If you
can think of something more please let me know:
1. exposed ethernet cables. The ones you see dangling down the wall or
running over the ground ( like behind banks ;-) ).
2. Improperly implemented Wireless AP's
3. Public IM and Mail usage inside private networks.
4. Social engineering: I know this is a vast field, but I am only
referring to the situations where say, you leave a mp3 player look-alike
usb memory stick, with a Trojan, on the ground, near the entrance door,
and the first employee to see it takes and happily plugs it into the
office system (Do you remember "Curiosity is by far the biggest killer
of crows !!! :-D ")
5. Dial-up modem pools. (often the most neglected in terms of security
hardening, not the SA guyz fault really, how many security devices or
technologies do you find in the market that are targeted for modem
pools?)
6. Data storage and computer devices that are allowed to be taken
outside the company. IPOD's, laptops, memory sticks, camera's (yes
camera's too), audio/video CD's, PDA's etc etc.
7. Like pumba would tell timon .. ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON
AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON....

:-D

Thankyou,
Nikun

Hello All,
 
I sincerely apologize for being silent for quite a long time. Life has been
really hectic and I am trying to sort things out.
 
Thank you Deepson, for introducing me.
 
For one question which I read about OWASP India chapter, let me keep you
posted that there are various chapters around India, but I really don't know
how active they are. Visit www.owasp.org <http://www.owasp.org/>  and check
out all chapters in the interactive map :-)
 
When we met last time (Deepson, Akash (if I am not wrong) and myself), we
decided to meet once in a month on the third Saturday. 
 
This weekend and the next, I am tied up with work. If you wanna meet, I
would definitely encourage that. But, I will be there from the next meeting.

 
If we can work on bringing OWASP Conference to India, that would be great,
but it's a huge task. 
 
Keep writing folks.

Hi,

   Gr8 hari, at last you came from nowhere :-) 

What I suggest is those who are interested in "OWASP group" not OWASP,
letz meetup and plan how we can make our Bangalore chapter active. Let
the mailings and discussions continue via the mailing list. 

 

A club or a group will be active and lively only when some events
happen. So we have to conduct some sessions or training programs. 

People from the group itself can take that. I can see a lotz of
experienced persons in our mailing list.  

 

Thanks & Regards,

    Deepson Thomas

Hi
 
For OOB access this link might help you
http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1812/183.htm

this oertains to routers
Routers MUST support Out-Of-Band (OOB) access. OOB access SHOULD provide the same functionality as in-band access. This access SHOULD implement access controls, to prevent unauthorized access.
