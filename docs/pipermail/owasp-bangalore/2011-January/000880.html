<PRE>Hi all,

Hope you are doing well.

So there was this thread on CAPTCHAs on Security focus lately and I happened
to read this new idea on CAPTCHA. This is what he said.

&quot;I hate captchas, always have so I use a reverse captcha on sites that I
build. You add a field to the form with name and id of email. You then give
it a label that says &quot;Please leave blank&quot; and hide them both with CSS. Most
people won't see them because the CSS works, even if they do see them they
read the message and obey. Spam engines on the other hand spot the email
field and happily fill it in. You then silently drop any contact forms with
values in the email field.&quot;

Just wanted to know your opinion on this. How did you find this idea of
tricking spammers? I am concerned about this idea because of the easiness of
its implementation. But there can be concerns regarding customization of bot
softwares depending on the individual forms with such implementations. What
else do you have in mind?
