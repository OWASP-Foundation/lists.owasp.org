Subject: [OWASP-BLR]password in clear - mailed
Message-ID: <bb1a49670601112008y1c62173fla0c38b3fb05ffbf0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Just subscribed to this mailing list, while doing so, i noticed(couldnt have
missed it, its in BOLD). Dont use a valuable password and line following it
was even interesting, your password will be sent in clear once a month.
Just being little bit paranoid, are there reason why passwords are sent
'pro-actively' once a month in mail?
It could have been a reactive one, like when user forgets password, ask him
to provide email address and send password. Agreed we are just using this
password to protect mailiing list, but still i feel users in order to avoid
passwords might have same password used else where or might show a pattern
which is still dangerous, any comments!
