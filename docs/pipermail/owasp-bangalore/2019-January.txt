Thanks Amir!

It sounds clear and we are planning to implement "X509" certificate
authentication (handles only authentication) with JWT tokens (handles
authorization). I believe this implementation is very secure.

You can always use easy-rsa if you are not interested in going down the
route of managed PKI.

https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Easy-RSA

I have used easy-rsa to do PKI for internal LANs in the past and works
fairly well when you control the servers and the hosts.

Hey Abhay are you talking about this from cloudflare?

https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl

Never used it before but would love to hear your thoughts on its usage.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] CSP- Implementation Issue - Query
Message-ID: <CA+waq764Y1ZBZVG4ZYZUF-TdFFx8=YuHKePKODbmki_31CwT=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Following is CSP policy. for example derived from gmail response headers..

Question is ?
Below implementation allowed white listed domains only in "script-src"
directive but a 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' directives also used next
'self'.

*Is this 'unsafe-inline' / 'unsafe-eval' will be used by all white-listed
domains including 'self' ? or It's only for 'self' domain only ?*

content-security-policy:
script-src https://clients4.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/
 https://www.google.com/js/bg/
 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'
 https://mail.google.com/_/scs/mail-static/
 https://hangouts.google.com/

Thanks & Regards,
Sai

A CSP Policy only applies on the origin that is current. Or in other
words: the domain that you see on the address bar.

The following CSP:

```
content-security-policy:
script-src https://a.com 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'
```

in english means:

allow script tags on the current webpage (where this header is being
served) to use the following 4 sources.

So a script tag of <script src="https://a.com/a.js"> will load, but
<script src="https://b.com/b.js"> will immediately get rejected.

The self, unsafe-inline, and unsafe-eval also _only apply on the current
page. If for some reason you have a <iframe src="x.com">, this policy
won't apply there.

For eg, for embedded resources, the spec[0] says:

>The policy of the embedding resource controls what may be embedded. The
embedded resource, however, is controlled by the policy delivered with
the resource, or the policy of the embedding resource if the embedded
resource is a globally unique identifier (or a srcdoc frame).

As with all things CSP, it is easiest to answer questions by testing out
things, just setup 2 webservers on different ports and test out by
sending different headers/content and observe the behaviour.

Hope this helps,
Nemo

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Backdoor malware sources required
Message-ID: <CANH+qkySvDv1ygUtW8omNiTwwPgDX46KwLY8hX46QBKTP1+rYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I have started working on a project to perform static and dynamic analysis
on malware specifically backdoors that affect Windows systems.
But am unable to find any viable sources to download backdoors, VX Heaven
seems to have a large collection of malwares and viruses but unable to
download them.

Can someone suggest any good sources to download backdoors from (which
target Windows) ?
Also any recommendations on opensource tools which I could use for this
project ?

Regards,
Ankita S Shetty
