Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Introducing myself to the members
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=GRrK2ATwkg0meQH2GYDrBptzSqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OWASP Bangalore members,

Greetings!

I am Shailendra Kadre from JP Nagar. I have just joined this mailing list.
So thought of just introducing myself to this group.

I am an IT professional with conventional ADMS back ground. 14 years of
experience in Application Development and Maintenance, Project and Program
management. New to the IT Security field but I am pretty serious about
it.Recently I have published a book by the name 'Going Corporate: A Geek's
Guide' in USA with Apress Inc. The book is on IT Operations and Delivery
Management.

I have two kids Neha (7) and Vivek (3). Neha is going to PSBB school in 3rd
standard and Vivel has just started schooling. My wife Meenakshi works for
an insurance company. Currently I am on my own trying to cut a niche for
myself in the field of InfoSec. I am guest lecturer in Operations Management
in a couple of Universities in Bangalore. My hobbies are photography,
travelling, reading and making new friends.

It will be great to know the other members of this group as the time passes
by. Some one recently told me, I can take some courses at OWASP site but
when I visited the site yesterday there was nothing like that. Can anybody
help me with that?

Cheers,

Shailendra

I have an excellent opportunity with my team in Bangalore for a senior
security engineer, focusing on application security that I would like to
post to your local OWASP community.  I have posted to the Global OWASP
AppSec job board, with little success.  This is the main reason for my
grassroots efforts with various communities like yours.  I can?t think of a
better audience to present this message to and would love you help.****

** **

I?ve attached the details of the role and my contact info is included.
Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you in advance. ****
