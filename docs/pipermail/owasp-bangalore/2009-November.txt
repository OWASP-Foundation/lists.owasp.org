Dear OWASP Members,

There is no denying that cyber security has become integral part of
protecting our nation's integrity. This fact can't be highlighted more
than the venerable presence of the most respected technocrat India has
ever produced, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (Former President of India) and Vice
Admiral Shekhar Sinha VSM, NM & BAR, Chief - Integrated Defence Staff,
Ministry of Defence who will grace the upcoming event "Securitybyte &
OWASP AppSec Asia 2009" to be held on 17th - 20th November 2009 at Hotel
Crowne Plaza, Gurgaon, Delhi NCR.

OWASP India is glad to know that our whole and sole mission has reached
the most highest echelons of government. 

You would be glad to know that as of now we have got 300+ confirmed
participation requests. The participation is in amalgamation of the best
and the brightest - civil/government servants, successful entrepreneurs,
InfoSec experts, hackers, other IT professionals and academia. 

We appreciate your enormous support and foresee similar participation
for our future events as well. We have very limited seats available and
even if you intend to register onsite then let us know today to check
the availability.

Many Thanks,

	Collaborative Security
Message-ID: <b81186a60911112302x1f816b9au4630382aba6695ea@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP members,
Some time ago, I had shared on this mailing list about an IEEE
workshop that we are organizing in Bangalore on Dec 9th.
You can find the updated information at http://www.cosec-workshop.info/

Now, in addition to the already planned Academia talks (as shown on
the website) and a couple of Industry talks (being planned), we would
also like to do a hands-on tutorial session on a security tool (say
for pen-testing or disassembly - IDA Pro ? OllyDbg ? etc).

So, if anybody on this list would be interested in giving an Invited
tutorial at the workshop, then please do reply back. It should be
around 30-45 minutes, entirely technical, hands-on and most important
of all, it should NOT be a product promotion (sorry folks, but this
being a research-based workshop we usually discourage such
promotions).

Please do respond back at the earliest, and we can then discuss your
presentation topic and finalize on maybe 1 or at most 2 such tutorial
sessions.

thanks and regards
Samir Saklikar

During the OWASP APPSECDC event Jeff Williams the OWASP Board Chair provided
a keynote to summarize OWASP Foundation where we are,  where we are going;
this can now be found on the HOME PAGE of http://www.owasp.org on the top
right

Or you can click here:
http://www.owasp.org/images/4/49/OWASP_AppSec_DC_2009_Speech.pdf

We encourage you to review it and then communicated this message to your
local chapters as we ALL continue to evolve OWASP Foundation in to the
professional association that it has become.

If you have contacts with the media, press etc., this would be of value to
them to better understand the mission of OWASP

===

Discussion for those that were not at OWASP APPSEC SUMMIT or APPSECDC ?  Do
you agree/disagree with the statements, what did was missed?

   NASSCOM-DSCI Information Security Summit 2009
 Hotel Shangri-La, Ashoka Road, New Delhi (November 23-24, 2009)

  Dear Sir / Madam  Data Security Council of India (DSCI) has developed Best
Practices for Data Protection through its programs that include the Content
Aggregation Program (CAP), Security Surveys, and collaboration with
knowledge sources and information security experts. As part of CAP, DSCI has
mapped several compliance regulations, into appropriate security controls
that need to be deployed for complying with these requirements. This was a
critical step towards defining DSCI Best Practices for Data Protection. The
compliance requirements have been mapped with ISO 27001 international
standard for security practices, and OECD Privacy Principles for privacy
requirements, among other international standards. Mapping with these
standards has helped standardize the controls, and led to the creation of
DSCI Security Framework (DSF) and DSCI Privacy Framework (DPF), which will
enable service providers in India to be not only in compliance with
regulatory requirements of clients? countries, but also make them really
secure. The best practices meet will focus on:
DSCI Security (DSF?) and Privacy (DPF?) Framework and the DSF? Technical
Model

   - Outsourcing Security Challenges: Outside-In View
   - Forensics Investigation Practices for strong Data Protection Regime
   - Emerging Disciplines of Security
   - Relevance of DSF?, DPF? and the SRO Ecosystem

Security has been established as an important function of organizations, and
is now expanding to strategic, tactical and operational layers of the
organization. Growing challenges of managing security, increasing threats
exposure of an organization and fast expanding compliance regimes demand a
comprehensive approach towards security. On the other hand, the
organizations? IT  ecosystem is changing because of virtualization and
migration to cloud computing. These trends challenge the established notions
of security, and require an overhaul of organization?s security strategy.
The complex web of compliance regulations that are specifying increasing
requirements for data security and privacy are putting increasing pressure
on the security managers. This has created immense opportunities for
security discipline, which have seen phenomenal growth in the recent times.
Different approaches and frameworks have emerged that promises to address
specific or enterprise wide security challenges. Security market is
responding to these changes by the way of consolidation and innovation that
lead to creation of an existing security technology market profile. The
summit will take a review of all such trends including:

   - Building a comprehensive security landscape
   - Security in changing IT ecosystem: virtualization and cloud computing
   - Expanding compliance regime- dictating security priorities
   - Protecting your enterprise: Challenges, approaches and frameworks
   - Consolidation and dynamism of security technology market trends

  You are cordially invited to participate in the 2 days summit. You may
also depute senior representatives to attend the conference as esteemed
delegates. We would request you to confirm your participation to my
colleagues Nikhil Chachra / Anshul Yadav latest by closing hours of November
21, 2009. For any further assistance, they can be reached at  (Mobile:
09810118828/09953221908, Email: nikhil at dsci.in / anshul.yadav at dsci.in). The
