hi;

In content spoofing there is not only html based injection but it can be
done various ways like  e-mail (phishing), bulletin-board postings(XSS) and
chat-room transmissions(XSS). An attacker may modify information and links
in an  Web site by accessing and altering content on the server if there is
lack of permission.

Content Spoofing is a general concept. If I am the administrator of a
company's proxy server, I can modify the content before it reaches the
employees. This would be called content spoofing. Spam emails claiming to
come from a bank are also a type of content spoofing.

HTML Injection is just one of the several ways to spoof content. It is
similar in concept to XSS, except that here you are trying to inject HTML
instead of Javascript. Its by far the easiest way to spoof content, and very
much prevalent.

As per my knowledge there's not much difference. HTML Injection is the way
to do Content Spoofing. In other words HTML Injection is a vulnerability and
Content Spoofing is a consequence of that (attack). Altering the contents of
a page by injecting fake contents may actually change the content of the
article.

A very nice read indeed. These attackers really have spent enough effort in
building the strategy. Neat execution.
