Subject: [OWASP-BLR]Introduction, Meeting Planning
Message-ID: <E1F5GDT-0005oG-Mj@mail.sourceforge.net>

Hello All,
 
First, I would like to welcome you all to the OWASP Bangalore Chapter
Mailing list.
 
To give you a brief update, I have been with OWASP since the beginning and I
was very much interested to run the Bangalore Chapter. As you are aware,
there are meetings happening all over the World Chapters and Bangalore
Chapter has been quite since the beginning. 
 
Initially, I tried to organize for a meeting, but could not succeed as there
was no place for us to meet. 
 
May I request members to send in their suggestions for organizing meetings
at Bangalore? Can anyone sponsor for the first meeting? It can be your
office space or any other. Alternatively, I really don't mind meeting at a
Coffee outlet too, but we should not have a lot of disturbance. This is the
only constraint. 
 
Please let me know your thoughts and we shall definitely start meeting and
plan forward. 
 
Your Partner in Learning,
Hari
