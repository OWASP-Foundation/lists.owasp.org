Sir,

I am research Scholar from IIT roorkee. My research
area is cross site scripting vulneratbilities. I am
realy delighted to see the activiities of OWASP . The
objective of OWASP and its systematic approaches
motivates me to learn more from the organisation.  At
present I have finalised my topic and I am in the next
phase of my research. I wish to partcipate in the
activities of OWASP Bangalore and like to receive
guidance from the Experts of OWASP . I am intereseted
to reside at Bangalore for atleast  a period of 6
months from January 2007. My Guide at IIT Roorkee
Dr.Kum Kum Garg has encouraged me to do so.  In this
concern I need to submit a acceptance letter from an
expert associated with OWASP -Bangalore. The expert
should act as external guide for this period during my
stay at Bangalore. 
I would request your goodself to be my guide or
recommend a guide. Kindly advise me regarding this.

Thanking You
Yours faithfully
