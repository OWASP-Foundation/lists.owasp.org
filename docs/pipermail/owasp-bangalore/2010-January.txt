Srikanth,
A good starting point would be from OWASP Top 10 , 
and get some hands on with Webgoat already present on OWASP project archives.

Sundar.

Welcome to 2010! We are proud to announce the immediate availability of
our newly ?reborn? HITB ezine! You can grab your digital copies here:

https://www.hackinthebox.org/misc/HITB-Ezine-Issue-001.pdf

As some of you may know, we?ve previously had an ezine that
used to be published monthly, however the birth of the HIT-
BSecConf conference series has kept us too busy to continue
working on it. Until now that is...

As with our conference series, the main purpose of this new
format ezine is to provide security researchers a technical
outlet for them to share their knowledge with the security
community. We want these researchers to gain further recog-
nition for their hard work and we have no doubt the security
community will find the material beneficial to them.

We have decided to make the ezine available for free in the
continued spirit of HITB in ?Keeping Knowledge Free?. In addi-
tion to the freely available PDF downloads, combined editions
of the magazine will be printed in limited quantities for distri-
bution at the various HITBSecConf?s around the world - Dubai,
Amsterdam and Malaysia. We aim to only print somewhere
between 100 or 200 copies (maybe less) per conference so be
sure to grab a copy when they come out!

Happy New Year once again and we hope you enjoy the zine!

How a security consultant can act as a Forensic Investigator? What kind of
business opportunity and how to use some specific technologies to adapt
Forensic investigation



* *

*Hacking Web Goat** **by** **Sundar *



WebGoat is a deliberately insecure J2EE web application maintained by OWSAP
designed to teach web application security lessons. In each lesson, users
must demonstrate their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a
real vulnerability in the WebGoat application. For example, in one of the
lessons the user must use SQL Injection to steal fake credit card numbers.
The application is a realistic teaching environment, providing users with
hints and code to further explain the lesson.

*News Bites** **by** **Akash***


Fifteen minute update and discussion on computing security aspects that made
it into the news since the last meet.

Hi Sundar,

It would be great to get examples/case-studies of where historically
security has been breached in public infrastructure and what impact it had.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Pre-nullcon Hacking challenge (Win Free Pass + 2
	nights stay at the venue)
Message-ID: <b71b09a51001180237p633d5f0agd4742bde62b981ca@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Greetings from null!
We thought it will be a good idea to get people to warm-up before
nullcon, so here is your chance to Win a free pass + two nights stay
at The Retreat. All you have to do is run over few trivial puzzles and
challenges and the prize is yours. In case you have already bought the
ticket don't worry we'll reimburse your ticket if you win.

Hacking Challenge: http://nullcon.net/challenge/

Theme:
If you have spent anytime with puzzles like notpron or klueless, or
other hacking challenges, this one lies somewhere in between. (We
thought if you are going to pull your hair out solving the puzzle, its
only fair that you learn something while doing so.)

Rules:
Ok, here you should pay more attention:
1. Each level gives you sets of clues to reach to the next level.
Following these clues you should figure your way to the next level.
Once you have reached the final level you'll know how to claim the
booty.
2. Hints will be provided for each level through twitter or null
mailing list or nullcon.net website. More details will be available
shortly.
3. This challenge does NOT give participants any legal permission to
exploit http://nullcon.net or its hosting partner in a destructive
manner . Any attack against the site or the hosted servers will be
observed under general legal framework.

Tools:
1. Armed with your favorite hacking and debugging  tools is advisable.
(It will be a good idea to take the new Matriux or BT4 for a ride.)

Good Luck and Have fun :)
See you at nullcon Goa 2010

nullcon Goa 2010 Highlights
- Technical talks by renowned speakers
- Win FREE seat for SANS Sec 504: Hacker Techniques, Exploits &
Incident Handling class (worth USD 4095)

*Null Bangalore Upcoming Meet for Feb*

*Saturday, 13th of Feb 2010 **10am sharp*

**Forensics** **by** **Dr.* *Chandrasekar Umapathy* **

How a security consultant can act as a Forensic Investigator? What kind of
business opportunity and how to use some specific technologies to adapt
Forensic investigation





*Introduction to securing critical  infrastructure such as power
grid,nuclear plants etc by Sundar*



WebGoat is a deliberately insecure J2EE web application maintained by OWSAP
designed to teach web application security lessons. In each lesson, users
must demonstrate their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a
real vulnerability in the WebGoat application. For example, in one of the
lessons the user must use SQL Injection to steal fake credit card numbers.
The application is a realistic teaching environment, providing users with
hints and code to further explain the lesson.
