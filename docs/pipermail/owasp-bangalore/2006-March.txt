Hello Mayank,

Welcome to the OWASP Bangalore Chapter and thank you for kick starting a
thread. Yes, as you mentioned, there are quite a number of people in
Bangalore who work with the Security domain, but have not been on to OWASP.
As far as my understanding goes, only people with interest have joined here
(as this is not a yahoo group where everyone registers). I strongly feel
that the potential to meet and discuss is not being utilized. 

I have started welcome messages long time back, but have not seen any
replies. You are the first one to start. 

It would be good if we can discuss over mails and also make some time to
meet so that we develop 'togetherness'.

Anticipating many mails to pour in...

Your Partner in Learning,
Hari

Hi Hari,

I have also been a member but could not see/initiate/participate in any 
activity. Probably the number of users are quite less here. But as far as 
my experience goes, there are many people in Bangalore who are working in 
Security domain and have been quite active.

Anyways, let us first decide upon some kind of agenda and then perhaps we 
can meet. If this agenda is to just welcome/meet and decide on activities, 
I feel that could be done on mails/forums itself (as not many are in an 
active phase).

Let us see the mail's reaction. I am expecting some mails on this thread. 
Get started group :-)

Hello Hari, Mayank and group,

Its good to see some activity kicking in at last.
It would be good if we could have a prelim meeting of some sorts--as a
means of networking, knowledge sharing etc.

Always open to ideas.

Heres hoping the others in the group chip in with their responses.

Thanks
Karthik A

hi Har (wei have 2 Haris here)....,

Well ass of now we received around 3 mails...but I am sure there are other 
people who are also involved.

We have a full fledged Security group in C-DAC and I kow some friends who 
are into Web Apps Seurity. Before calling everyone and others....let us 
discuss what should be the focus of the group.

OWASP Local Chapter guidance is available at this URL
http://www.owasp.org/local/rules.html

What should be focus on?
- Development
- Expertise on already exisiting OWASP tools
- Contribution to docs
- Organising workshops etc...

discuss what should be the focus of the group.

OWASP Local Chapter guidance is available at this URL
http://www.owasp.org/local/rules.html

What should be focus on?
- Development
- Expertise on already exisiting OWASP tools
- Contribution to docs
- Organising workshops etc...

  Thanks,
  Hariprasad.

Subject: [OWASP-BLR]Meetings & Workshpts
Message-ID: <E1FHwwz-0007k2-2t@mail.sourceforge.net>

Hello All,
 
It's very nice to see suggestions pouring in for the group.
 
As my other learned members mentioned, there are quite a number of people
who are into Software Security and before we go any further, we should all
meet once and work on the agenda and then get going with the group. 
 
I work on Kasturba Road (one end of MG Road) and live near Sarjapur Road. I
am giving this information so that if other members can send in their office
and residence locations, we can consolidate and meet at a point where it
will not be a great burden to at least most of us. 
 
Also, which day of the week would be better for us to meet? For me, a
Saturday morning breakfast session would be much better (it will be a
relaxed meeting)..
 
Suggestions are welcome. 
 
Your Partner in Learning,
Hari

I work with Fidelity Investments near KGA Golfcourse, and non-office

Hello All,
 
It's very nice to see suggestions pouring in for the group.
 
As my other learned members mentioned, there are quite a number of
people
who are into Software Security and before we go any further, we should
all
meet once and work on the agenda and then get going with the group. 
 
I work on Kasturba Road (one end of MG Road) and live near Sarjapur
Road. I
am giving this information so that if other members can send in their
office
and residence locations, we can consolidate and meet at a point where it
will not be a great burden to at least most of us. 
 
Also, which day of the week would be better for us to meet? For me, a
Saturday morning breakfast session would be much better (it will be a
relaxed meeting)..
 
Suggestions are welcome. 
 
Your Partner in Learning,
Hari

Hello All,
 
I don't think it is wise to wait for people to respond, considering the fact
that each one is busy with their own schedules. My sincere suggestion is
that we who have shown interest and responded should take the initiative and
meet. Once the ball gets rolling, it speeds up.
 
What do you say?
 
As per the emails, I can Deepson (Koramangala 8 Block), Mayank (Near
E-City), Akash (Koramangala 8 Block), Guruprasad (Girinagar), Sunil
(Girinagar), Himanshu and I (Sarjapur Road) are connected and ready to meet.
Read the information in braces as place of Residence. 
 
So, why don't we all catch up next Saturday morning for breakfast? I
apologize if I missed any one in the list, but I have just taken names from
people who have provided their work and home locations. 
 
What would be the ideal place for meeting? 
 
Hari

Hello Mayank,

Any particular reason why you would not be able to make it this weekend? It
would be great if you can be there...

Barista (Beside William Penn showroom) in Koramangala opens at 7 AM. So, can
we catch up there? 

Alternatively, Shanti Sagar on the Koramangala main road (100 Ft Road) is
also open which can accommodate people to sit and eat. 

Any more suggestions are also welcome..

If we can confirm, then I will post it on the web site.

Regards,
Hari

Hi Hari,

Thanks for keeping us all connected. Seems most of the members can 
converge with Sat morning....in my last mail I had discussed about general 
OWASP working group agenda. I think in this meeting the most important 
(from my point of view) work could be

 	a) Identifying why we are here
 	b) how do we relate ourselves to security
 	c) individual introduction and his/her interests/view on security
 	d) ofcourse breakfast, coffee (you can have tea as well :-) )
 	e) Responsibilities
 		- Making the group active
 		- Initiating some kind of activities (may be tools 
knowledge & usage, standard docs, practices etc)

Anything else ..... group....

Also Sat morning, time can be confirmed.....8.30 or 9.00am seems 
nice.....dont know whether shops are opened at that time....

Personally I will not be able to attend the meeting but will definitely 
ping you guys to get updated what happened....I request Akash (my friend 
and former colleague to update you all about C-DAC'a security group 
activities....)


Regards,
Mayank

Hi Hari,

Thanks for keeping us all connected. Seems most of the members can 
converge with Sat morning....in my last mail I had discussed about general 
OWASP working group agenda. I think in this meeting the most important 
(from my point of view) work could be

 	a) Identifying why we are here
 	b) how do we relate ourselves to security
 	c) individual introduction and his/her interests/view on security
 	d) ofcourse breakfast, coffee (you can have tea as well :-) )
 	e) Responsibilities
 		- Making the group active
 		- Initiating some kind of activities (may be tools 
knowledge & usage, standard docs, practices etc)

Anything else ..... group....

Also Sat morning, time can be confirmed.....8.30 or 9.00am seems 
nice.....dont know whether shops are opened at that time....

Personally I will not be able to attend the meeting but will definitely 
ping you guys to get updated what happened....I request Akash (my friend 
and former colleague to update you all about C-DAC'a security group 
activities....)


Regards,
Mayank

Hi,

I support Akash. Even if we have 2 or 3 people meeting, this Saturday the 
meeting should happen or otherwise it will keep on extending.....as 
said Akash can very well represent our secueity activities and I can be in 
direct touch with him.

So as of now, Harinath, Depson, Akash (total 3) seem positive and 
confirmed. I was informed in advance this Monday itself that Sat & Sun are 
engaged for some official purpose. I really will not be able to make it. 
Sorry for that....but all the best and wishes for the first active 
meeting, and I hope it gets started this Saturday.... :-)

You are most welcome to join.

OK a couple of things.

1. The URL for OWASP-Bangalore : http://www.owasp.org/local/bangalore.html
2. Hari is the chapter leader. Could you please update the meeting
details since it can get lost in the mails we have been passing
around.

Sorry another one. When ever i reply to a mail in the list rather than
going to the mailing list address I get the individual memeber email
address. I think its because the way the mailing list software has
been configured. Can something be done about this. Please.

regards
akash

Subject: [OWASP-BLR][Owasp-world] Reminder: 2006 European OWASP AppSec Conference - May 30-31, 2006 near Brussels
Message-ID: <02db01c650e0$f9251050$1204a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is holding its annual European AppSec (Application Security)
Conference May 30-31, 2006 at the Catholic University of Leuven (aka
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or K.U. Leuven) in Leuven, which is 25 km
from Brussels.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES: Early registration for the conference ends April 30.
The reduced rates for the conference hotels ends mid to late April depending
on the hotel.

AGENDA: This conference has dual tracks like last years' US conference. The
speakers and agenda are available on the OWASP website at:

             http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html.

This year's speakers include popular speakers from previous conferences like
Dinis Cruz and Ivan Ristic, but also includes many new speakers to the OWASP
Conference, including Andrew Van Der Stock (project lead for the OWASP
Guide), Roger Thornton (CTO of Fortify), Mike Andrews of Foundstone, and
myself (Dave Wichers - COO of Aspect Security).

NEW: We also have introduced for the first time two panels, which should
generate some lively debate. The first panel is on "Should companies be
emulating Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)?" and the 2nd is
on: "Are we winning the war?" - Are we actually getting a handle on
application security issues and making things better, or are things still
getting worse?

REGISTRATION DETAILS: Registration is open and the conference fee is 300
Euros for early registration and 350 Euros for registrations after April 30,
2006.

TUTORIALS - May 29, 2006:

OWASP has arranged to have two one-day tutorials the day prior to the
conference. These one day tutorials will be held at the university and are
only 600 Euros for conference attendees.

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE: This powerful hands on course
focuses on the most common web application security problems, including the
OWASP Top Ten. The course introduces and demonstrates hacking techniques,
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students
really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code. 

WEB SERVICES and XML SECURITY: The movement towards Web Services and Service
Oriented architecture (SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to
deal with new risks posed by these architectures. This session takes a
pragmatic approach towards identifying Web Services security risks and
selecting and applying countermeasures to the application, code, web
servers, databases, application, and identity servers and related software.

More details on these training courses are available at:

        http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/training.html 

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - May 30, 2006: The traditional evening dinner/social
event is being held at the nearby Faculty Club. The Faculty club is a
restaurant annex conference centre located in a medieval part of Leuven. We
can walk there from the conference, and will have a social hour followed by
a 3-course dinner. Dinner is typically followed by drinks nearby. The dinner
event is 40 Euros.

HOTELS - We have arranged for conference rates at nearby hotels. Many of
these rates expire mid to late April, so please book early. More information
is available at:

 
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/accommodations.html 

If you know others that would be interested in attending this OWASP
conference, please forward them this email and let them know about this
opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Thanks, Dave
