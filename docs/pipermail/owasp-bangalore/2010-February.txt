Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] Cross-Site History Manipulation (XSHM)
Message-ID: <9A91891EFFF4824C8F364DE14CC14B673C18CE50A1@GS2K7CLUSTER.fiserv.co.in>

Checkmarx Research Labs has identified a new critical vulnerability in
Internet Explorer (other browsers are probably exposed the same way) that
would allow hackers to easily compromise web applications. Cross-Site
History Manipulation (XSHM) is a newly discovered zero-day attack: attackers
may have been using it for a long time, but the application and security
communities do not know it.

Seems some DNS issue with different records. www.tcs.com works but tcs.com
is pointed to some other IP. IP looks to be of the same range as NS for
tcs.com so hopefully all is well. Sysadmin might not find good appraisal
this season!

Strange. It was different when I last did. Could be under maintenance or
misconfiguration, doesn't seem to be defacement though! Rest TCS folks on
the lists can confirm.

Message-ID: <4b6eadec.9713f30a.3f48.2aa7@mx.google.com>

Here is the sequence that I observed:

 

1.     www.tcs.com and tcs.com were found to be pointing to different IPs.
www.tcs.com was working properly with
http://www.tcs.com/homepage/Pages/default.aspx as default home page and
tcs.com was available for sale. 

2.     After a while, Rakshit pointed that both the domains had same IP
address but tcs.com was still "available for sale" while www.tcs.com was
working. Till this time, it appeared to be some configuration error.

3.     Waited for some more time, both the domains were available for sale.
With all the files deleted from the web root of www.tcs.com. I tried
http://www.tcs.com/homepage/Pages/default.aspx  and
http://www.tcs.com/careers to get runtime error and page not found error
respectively. Couple of their other portals like nextstep etc. were throwing
error to the browser while accepting ssl certificates. Not sure, if it is
usual or appeared today only.

 

The domain sale page had a contact listed abed_uk at hotmail.com. I googled
this email account to find it listed as technical contact for many domains
with a similarity that all those domains were registered at Network
Solutions and obviously had same "available for sales" page set as home
page. Seems that their server(s) was compromised for few hours today.

Correct. The IP address that was resolving against the domain during
compromised period was: 205.178.152.154 and now after restoration its:
216.15.200.140. So not really network/application attack but DNS/account
compromise.

Dhruv,

I just want to add that based on your description it is not the server but
the domain registar or their account there that was probably compromised.

It seems like it was a DNS-related hack. No deep technical details available
but seems like the website was defaced for some time and then possibly taken
down to diagnose and rectify the flaw.

http://techie-buzz.com/india-tech/tcs-hacked-by-french-hacker.html

<http://techie-buzz.com/india-tech/tcs-hacked-by-french-hacker.html>

The website TCS.com which belongs to India?s largest software vendor, Tata
Consultancy Services, was hacked today by a French hacker. This hack will
definitely lead to total embarrassment for the softwarefirm who thrives on
creating software and security systems day in and day out.

If you visit TCS.com right now you will be greeted with a screen which looks
similar to the screenshot below.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] burp sequencer ?
Message-ID: <e5aa66f71002072358u6facb5b8ye9fb5b426a42f171@mail.gmail.com>

hi Friends,

How do we increase the size of Data intake for burp sequencer ?

Currently Burp Suite v1.1 supports a data size of 20000 (twenty thousand
units). how do we increase it significantly to a value of 200000 or more ?

Java experts do comment (Increase Java heap size or any other code changes
etc)

Thanks & regards,
Satyajit

I would like to ask users/WebAdmins/DBAs/Network Admins to keep their web software and other related softwares  up-to-date, no matter if it is a pain to do, because you could be the next in line to get hacked for using software which has vulnerabilities.


Thanks and Regards,

It seems like it was a DNS-related hack. No deep technical details available but seems like the website was defaced for some time and then possibly taken down to diagnose and rectify the flaw.

http://techie-buzz.com/india-tech/tcs-hacked-by-french-hacker.html


The website TCS.com which belongs to India's largest software vendor, Tata Consultancy Services, was hacked today by a French hacker. This hack will definitely lead to total embarrassment for the softwarefirm who thrives on creating software and security systems day in and day out.

If you visit TCS.com right now you will be greeted with a screen which looks similar to the screenshot below.

Automated discovery will never discover "all" vulnerabilities.
Think about this way, do you really want to find out all CSRF holes in 
your app? How exactly does an app discover a logic flaw?

In any case, w3af would be a nice open source start. If you got moolah, 
there are tons of neat tools from SpiDynamics, Watchfire, Acunetix, 
Armorize etc.
It may also be a good idea to involve source code analysis (provided you 
have access to the source).

Well, good discovery. But it doesn't seem to be an official website.
This is what the message on hacked site translates to:

???? ????????? ???????? = Moroccan-ul-Mujahideen group

Find screenshots of the original page from Google archives and also the
hacked page for the record.
Have copied this mail to the sites admin. Not sure if he/she can access mail
account if the login is compromised or if he cares!

Need to do some testing on the security of the products based on Zigbee.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] [Owasp-Mumbai] SOAP & Web Services issues -
	vulnerabilities
In-Reply-To: <d7b6f19b1002250350o3bb355b1s8122fcadbb0510fe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Purohit,

You can test for the following vulnerabilities in SOAP based Web Services:
External entity
XPath / Xquery Injection
XML Injection
Recursive payload
Oversized payload
WSDL scanning
Schema poisoning
Authentication/Authorization
Input flaws (SQL / XSS)
Error handling

Hope that helps.

The free version just checks for XSS and shows a lot of false positives.
