<PRE>Hi Arshad,
&#160;
Glad to see your email.&#160; Sorry for the delay as hasn't had a chance to log into my personal email due to other priorities.&#160; 
&#160;
Added Akash and Prashant to look and organise this event at Bangalore.
&#160;
Akash/Prashant, this presentation will be really a value add for audience and we are lucky that Arshad is here with us in Bangalore and&#160;he is a well known speaker of OWASP and is presenting at OWASP-Sydney.
&#160;
Hope we can get together for Arshad presentation.&#160; Including Null group too.
&#160;

Any information from Bangalore, Raj?

As an aside, I am booked for the morning of April 18th to speak to
the Cloud Security Group at Wipro. &#160;Their Security Architects have
shown interest in learning about RC3.

Here is also one more piece of interesting information you might
want to share with the OWASP chapter:

-----
A free and open-source web-application - StrongKey CryptoCabinet -
was released today for General Availability. The CryptoCabinet is
built using the RC3 architecture and can be used to encrypt files
and store them in public or private clouds (or SAN/NAS devices)
while storing cryptographic keys securely outside the cloud on the
StrongAuth KeyAppliance. The CryptoCabinet uses the StrongKey
CryptoEngine (<A HREF="http://www.cryptoengine.org">http://www.cryptoengine.org</A> - also FOSS) for its
underlying cryptographic functions and cloud communications.

Details can be found at <A HREF="http://www.cryptocabinet.org.">http://www.cryptocabinet.org.</A>

Thanks.

Arshad

&#160; &#160;BTW, do you know the OWASP Chapter leader in Bangalore? &#160;I am going to
&#160; &#160;be in Bangalore for 4-5 days between April 16th and 21st and I would
&#160; &#160;be happy to give them a similar presentation as I gave the Hyderabad
&#160; &#160;chapter. &#160;In fact, the presentation is updated now and will include a
&#160; &#160;demonstration of one of the RC3 applications we've created.

&#160; &#160;Would you be able to put me in touch with the BLR chapter contact?
&#160; &#160;Thanks.

&#160; &#160;Arshad
