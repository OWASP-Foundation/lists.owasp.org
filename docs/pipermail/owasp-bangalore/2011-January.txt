Message-ID: <AANLkTimCV-J4_fs4QWKsAoSg5ykjZ_F-j2wHBd8_dFu9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

We are proud to present (..drum roll starts ...)
The second edition of our very own, very popular ( ..increasing drum roll
tempo.. )
HackIM 2011 - The Pre-nullcon Hacker Challenge .. tadda!

Link: http://nullcon.net/nullconctf/hackim-2011/
After the remarkable success of last years challenge ( well we consider
frustrating 1000+ n00bs and keeping dozens of haXors sleepless for weeks as
success :) ). Here's your chance to Win a free pass with two days stay for
nullcon Goa 2011. All you have to do is run over few trivial puzzles and
challenges and the golden ticket is yours. In case you have already bought
the ticket don't worry we'll reimburse your ticket if you win.

Theme:
If you have spent anytime with puzzles like notpron or klueless, or other
hacking challenges, this one should lie somewhere in between. ( We thought
if you gonna pull your hair out solving the puzzle, its only fair that you
learn something while doing so.)

This time, first few levels are puzzle/quiz based and the later are based on
realistic scenarios.

Rules:
1. Players will need to create an account in order to participate in the
challenge.
2. Each level gives you sets of clues to reach to the next level. Following
these clues you should figure your way to the next level. Once you have
reached the final level you'll know how to claim the booty.
3. The unofficial back channel for the challenge is
irc.chat4all.org#nullcon & #n|u. Hints will also be provided for each
level through twitter
or null mailing list. More details will be available shortly.
4. This challenge does NOT give participants any legal permission to exploit
http://nullcon.net or its hosting partner in a destructive manner . Any
attack against the site or the hosted servers will be observed under general
legal framework.
5. Running Automation tools (Scanner/Enumerators/Password Crackers, etc) is
not allowed and won't help you complete the challenge in anyway.
6. Scoreboard for the challenge is available on
http://www.nullcon.net/challenge/scoreboard.php

Tools:
1. Armed with your favorite hacking and debugging  tools is advisable. (It
will be a good idea to take the new Matriux or BT4 for a ride.)

Good Luck and Have fun :)

Regards,
null Team

Hi all,

Hope you are doing well.

So there was this thread on CAPTCHAs on Security focus lately and I happened
to read this new idea on CAPTCHA. This is what he said.

"I hate captchas, always have so I use a reverse captcha on sites that I
build. You add a field to the form with name and id of email. You then give
it a label that says "Please leave blank" and hide them both with CSS. Most
people won't see them because the CSS works, even if they do see them they
read the message and obey. Spam engines on the other hand spot the email
field and happily fill it in. You then silently drop any contact forms with
values in the email field."

Just wanted to know your opinion on this. How did you find this idea of
tricking spammers? I am concerned about this idea because of the easiness of
its implementation. But there can be concerns regarding customization of bot
softwares depending on the individual forms with such implementations. What
else do you have in mind?

Hi Gunwant,
This method is good for a run-of-a-mill bots. The bots which simply scans
webpages for comments form and submit their spammy link ther filling all the
details asked. so yes you can make a plugin for off-the-shelf
CMS(WP/Drupal/Joomla) by this way. "A non intrusive spam protection"

But that's not what all the bot do, rather people customize bots as per web
pages to exploit the features.
Say a bot for web services like cbl.abuseat.org or iptools.com. Even for non
standard comments page like one at blogoscoped.com

In any such case where a script is modified for the target webpage, this won't work

thanks

*1. I think this point is valid even if you deploy full-fledge CAPTCHAs.
CAPTCHA deployed today could be exploitable a year later or may be earlier.*
**
*2. What if I use Auto-complete feature to turn-off the same, thereby
compromising user-convenience against Security?
