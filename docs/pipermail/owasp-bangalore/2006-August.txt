I think its rather nice that this mailing list can act as a meeting
point for customers and businesses as long the mailing list is not
profit driven.

But tell me something if your company is in Bangalore is it possible
to use it as a meeting place for our meets. Usually we get stuck on
choosing the appropriate venue every time.

In fact Hari mentioned in the very first meet about the need for
coporate sponsorship.

Team,
 
Gaurav is down with back problem and hence he will not be able to take the
session during this months meeting. Can anyone of you suggest a topic and
take the same for a small presentation for a discussion for the 19th
meeting?
 
Also, we need to work on the venue for the meeting. I request all members to
speak out their area of convenience and we shall pick the location which is
suited for the majority and going forward we can meet at various places. 
 
Suggestions requested.
 
Your Partner in Learning,

Hi Harinath, 
We are in need of Application Security tool  for testing our Java

Could you please pass on this information to me, if you know any one or any

XSS is so difficult to test it or what ? You can find
lot of tools in the Internet and regarding SQL
injection better to do code review...

If you like to use some tool to find SQL injection,
then it find's only very very easy SQL injection stuff
!!

application/your filtering/DB/place of bug
everything matters.

I dont think anybody do that in India !! ;-)

Don't want this to be a shameless plug, but my company (Secuprise) 
specializes in Web application security (XSS, SQL injection, Cookie/Auth 
handling etc).

Krishna/Hari, you guys can get in touch with me off-list.

thanks,
- Kalyan

I think its rather nice that this mailing list can act as a meeting
point for customers and businesses as long the mailing list is not
profit driven.

But tell me something if your company is in Bangalore is it possible
to use it as a meeting place for our meets. Usually we get stuck on
choosing the appropriate venue every time.

In fact Hari mentioned in the very first meet about the need for
coporate sponsorship.

Sounds like a plan. My company just grew out of its small office space 
and are in the process of moving to a bigger office and also moving 
towards the center of the city. I doubt the place will be ready for this 
months meet, but from next month on, my office space is free for all the 
meets :)

Attention OWASP Community,

OWASP is moving all of our mailing lists off of SourceForge and onto our
own infrastructure. We?re making this move to allow for better control
over the mail infrastructure and to address some service problems we?ve
been experiencing. Your account will be moved automatically, and you
don?t need to take any action. However, you may want to set your spam
filter to allow messages from the new lists. All OWASP email lists will
come from @lists.owasp.org. All OWASP lists can be found at
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo

Thank you for your continued support of OWASP.

Hi Krishna,

There are of course tools available for automated SQL and XSS testing but 
then my exp with these tools has been far from satisfactory.
Anyways you can contact me on jatin.libra at gmail.com if u want links to these 
tools but I would suggest you to hire any of the professional Pen-Testers 
out here to get ur apps tested manually.
There are no shortcuts to Pen-Testing.
Cheers
Jatinder

Hi Cherian,
Thanks for sharing that article. It was an interesting one no doubt.
My 2 cents on this topic.
Ok agreed that webScarab has some impressive functions and Burp is really 
helpul as a proxy to intercept data also That article also talks of tools 
like AppScan which have hardly ever pushed any of the apps i've pen-tested.
AppScan in particular just throws up false positives upon false positives.
I work as a pen-tester for a bank and we've tried various tools to automate 
our pen-test process and i've realied at the end of the day you need an 
experienced pen-tester.

Regards
Jatinder

Message-ID: <E1GCgT8-0006Ht-2z@mail.sourceforge.net>

Team,
 
Gaurav is down with back problem and hence he will not be able to take the
session during this months meeting. Can anyone of you suggest a topic and
take the same for a small presentation for a discussion for the 19th
meeting?
 
Also, we need to work on the venue for the meeting. I request all members to
speak out their area of convenience and we shall pick the location which is
suited for the majority and going forward we can meet at various places. 
 
Suggestions requested.
 
Your Partner in Learning,
Hari
