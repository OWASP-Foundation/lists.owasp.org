Subject: [Owasp-bangalore] OWASP @ BarCamp Bangalore 4
Message-ID: <mailman.14.1180282799.2372.owasp-bangalore@lists.owasp.org>

Hello All,
 
It has been really long since there has been an activity. Even though
meetings of OWASP Bangalore chapter have kicked off earlier, the momentum
has not been kept up and we could not continue to meet. I was looking at
various options and have been waiting for the right time to propose the next
meeting and I think I have the right time now. 
 
Have you heard of BarCamp? I will not explain a lot on BarCamp in this
email, however would request you to visit http://barcamp.org
<http://barcamp.org/>  to understand what these un-conferences are all
about? 
 
BarCamp Bangalore
Bangalore has been a host for the last 3 BarCamps and now we are preparing
for BarCamp Bangalore 4. Please visit http://barcampbangalore.org
<http://barcampbangalore.org/>  to have a look at what has happened at the
BCB (as it is shortly called) 3. After BCB3, we have (fortunately, I have
been part of the organizing committee) planned a calendar for BCB for 2007.
The BCB 4 is going to happen either during 14th/15th July or 21st/22nd July.
I will confirm the dates once we finalize them. 
 
OWASP @ BCB 4
The theme for BCB 4 is going to be something like a MetaCamp. OWASP as a
group can register and be there on those dates for discussions /
presentations with regards to Web Security. 
 
This is a very small introduction to my proposal, I would want to wait and
hear from all of you. I definitely think it would make sense for us to be
there at the event. If Yes, then we can plan for a meeting during the coming
weekend and take this forward. 
 
If you have not been to a BC earlier, I strongly recommend that you block
your calendars for the dates above. 
 
Anticipating energetic responses.
 
Regards,
Hari
