FIDELITY INTERNAL INFORMATION

Hi All,

This is Satish here. I am new to this mailing list. I am interested in
attending the session in Frazer town this weekend. I would like to know
if there are any formalities to complete before attending the session.
Is it open to everyone ? Do I have to book a seat? Whom to contact for
more details?  

Regards,

Satish G

Just got hand of it, thought of sharing with you all.

As per my knowledge, BSNL India gives 80 % of users ZTE modems.
Specifically
- ZXDSL 831 II.

here are few exploits out on wild.. watch out.

Change Admin Password & get full access to the modem

http://192.168.1.1/adminpasswd.cgi

URL Below gives access to configuration of the modem and you can get
PPPOE
user & password with any Asterisk Password Revealers

http://192.168.1.1/vpivci.cgi

Is anyone aware at BSNL or informed them ? If they dont push a firmware
update (Hope they do) there are lakhs of Indian users at risk.

If you are BSNL User with this modem, watch out.

- Prakash

Hey,

Could someone confirm whether the planned event is in the same venue.  I
do want to join, but just like to know that there is no change in the
planned meet tomorrow.

Thanks
Gandhi

Hi Satish,

No formalities... although the host of the location i have heard gives
seating preferences to people who bring him cookies :)

Just kidding... you will be most welcome both as a atendee and equally
important as a interactive participant, and together our knowledge base
shall grow.

Hi, 



Sorry I'm new to this mailing list. I would like to know more about Database security and the various compliance standards.

Any tools that could be evaluated OR tools which can be downloaded and investigated?

Hi Sarika,

Database security is not a small topic. There are many things involved in
database security.
Please be specific on what exactly are you looking for.

The standards that you are talking of are not specifically meant for
database security.
Secure database could be one of the requirements for complying to those
standards.

When you talk of tools, which tools are you exactly looking for ?

If you are looking for a Database vulnerability scanner, there are some
professional scanners as well as free to use available.

NGSSquirrel from Next Generation Secure Software is a professional database
scanner.

If you are looking around for a free tool which you can play around with,
you can use Scuba from Imperva.

Hope this helps.

Thanks,
Chintan

AppDetective is a commercial tool that you could evaluate.

>From open-source there are plenty of them that could be plugged
together to give you some amount of testing. You can check some from
the BackTrack toolset. My understanding is they together are not as
comprehensive as AppDetective. But you know what you want so may be
open-source ones could do the job for you.

For standards & hardening, the vendor sites generally provide good
best practices & hardening guides that you could validate against.
Usual good resources are MSDN for SQL, red-security & Oracle for
Oracle.

Please specify your problem area:

1. Database Name & version
2. Name of compliance you wanted to follow (each compliance has specific
requirement but @ bottomline is same "data -
    protection")
3. Criticality & Nature of data being stored
4. Current problem & how you see it & how you wanted to fix it.

There are several methods & tools to fix it but all can not be listed and
discussed. For a general info. just type your query in google and read tons
of material on everything you wanted to know.

Note/ Request: If you are taking specific help with someone then mail that
person only in-spite of complete mailing list
                       otherwise you may end-up revealing your confidential
information to everybody hence inviting a possible future
                       breach in ur company.

Yes, I did notice that when I searched for 'Australia Brazil football results' on google last day, clicked on the first link and there came this alert... Google wouldn't have topped that site unless otherwise it had a good page rank, I can't imagine how many would be infected by now. 

Thanks & Regards,

Subject: Null Bangalore Meeting on 5th September 2009 - An Update
To: null-co-in at googlegroups.com


Hi all,

A blog entry of this email here
http://null.co.in/2009/09/07/null-bangalore-meeting-on-5th-september-2009-an-update/

We had a combined NULL + OWASP meeting this time. The response was
very encouraging with over 20 people showing up.

TALKS

We had two informative talks
1. Cookie Replay Attacks by Ravi Gopal
2. Cloud Security by Shashidhar

In the cookie replay attacks talk and demo, Ravi demonstrated how
trivial it is to sniff an ethernet network to find google cookies and
then replay them to gain access to the gmail accounts. His research
has indicated that only the GX cookie value is enough to do this. The
attack is mitigated by using secure HTTP for your entire gmail
session. His blog entry about this is
http://ravigopalt.blogspot.com/2009/09/gmail-account-hacking-through-gx-cookie.html

In the the Cloud Security talk Shashidhar explained from the basics of
what is the historical background for cloud computing and took it all
the way to explain 15 domains people should be aware of before taking
their apps/businesses to the cloud. Interesting arguments were put
forth in support of and against what he presented. This also led to
Simran proposing the next meeting's topic.

One of the members was concerned that if all the sysadmin/security
related functions move to the cloud what will happen to his job.
Shashidhar assured him that there will be plenty of work going around
in the 15 domains he spoke about. Due to paucity of time he wasn't
able to cover all the points in the presentation he will surely
respond to any questions you might have after going through the
presentation.

MISC

1. We had a lucky draw to giveaway one NULL t-shirt. Gursev was the
one who won that.
2. Shashidhar suggested that in case the number of attendees becomes
more than 40 we can use the ISACA office for holding our meetings.

ATTACHMENTS
1. Cookie replay attacks presentation
2. Cloud Security presentation

NEXT MEETING on 19th SEPTEMBER 2009 - 10 AM

The following talks are scheduled

1. Practical Aspects of Taking your Application to the Cloud - Simran
Gambhir
2. Discussion on security incidents in the past - Led by Gursev
3. Demonstration of a tool - Amit Parekh

sundar, vibhav, et al,

i agree it was a great meet and the speakers were well prepared and very
knowledgeable. i think all there are more keen on the topics and level of
discussion rather than affiliations, so lets keep all informed as to what is
coming up, and everyone is welcome of course... affiliations are good to
help organise "events" as and when desired...

simran.

Subject: [OWASP-Bangalore] exploitable Crash Analyzer - Open Source Security
	Tool from Microsoft
Message-ID: <cf2478a20909110842l183ff6e1q18cd7f70acdae9d7@mail.gmail.com>

Microsoft released an open-source program designed to streamline the
labor-intensive process of identifying security vulnerabilities in software
while it?s still under development.


It provides automated crash analysis and security risk assessment. This tool
was created by the Microsoft Security Engineering Center (MSEC) Security
Science Team. exploitable Crash Analyzer (pronounced ?bang exploitable crash
analyzer?) combs through bugs that cause a program to seize up, and assesses
the likelihood of them being exploited by attackers. It?s a Windows debugger
extension that?s used during fuzz testing, when testers test the stability
and security of an application by throwing unexpected data at it.



The tool creates hashes to ensure each crash is unique then rates them
according to how exploitable it is - Exploitable, Probably Exploitable,
Probably Not Exploitable or Unknown.

Has anyone really tried this? If yes please explain.

James, it would be nice if you share what is that you are trying to 
understand. I for one do not endorse the idea of identifying a person by 
the company he/she works for.  I know many people who do not even work 
but better than folks working in companies you are asking for.

Cheers

james, it would be indeed nice to understand context as to why you want to
know what? as a point of interest, there are multiple IBM people and
multiple ex-satyam people that i know of... as for the others... its a big
group...

if your question was in the context of understanding if such an event is
more relevant to dynamic startup type of people or process driven large org
type of people (huge generalisation there, but i *presume* this is the
generalisation you *might* be making) - the know that the presentations are
relevant to all... as security is not a destination, its a process and the
process applies equally to large and small companies... the risks you take
depends on the type of data you are handling...

I am interested in seeing community expansion as this is the best method
for those who are newer to the topic of web application security than
those who have been doing it for awhile. I believe that IBM, Microsoft
and Oracle also have employees who have great knowledge but otherwise
only present it in an insular, internal-only context. The respective
bodies of knowledge from these firms needs to become more open where
they are sharing to the outside world and by participating in user
groups, this goal can be realized.

surprisingly, i have historically found mavericks in niche little
companies... pursuit of passion rather than process... there's a lot to be
said for the structure big companies can teach you (such as IBM), but don't
for a second think that people outside them are any less... in fact, in many
cases, they are far better as in big companies (especially like microsoft),
you get to the ceiling quicker, but the glass ceiling also keeps you from
going that extra step...
