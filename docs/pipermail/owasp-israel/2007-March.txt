Subject: [Owasp-israel] Announcement: 2nd OWASP IL mini conference at IDC,
	May 21th 2007

Hi Everyone, 

Following the big success of the 1st one, I'm glad to announce the 2nd
OWASP IL mini conference at Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC) on
May 21st 2007. The mini conference would be a half day event from around
14:00.

I'd like to officially make a call for speakers and sponsors. As at the
last event we had around 100! attendees, this can be a nice exposure for
both presented and sponsors.

Call for speakers
=============
If you would like to speak at the conference please send me a title and
abstract of your proposed topic as well as few words about yourself. 

Sponsorships
=========
Companies who would like to sponsor the event are welcomed to contact
me. This is a not for profit event and sponsorship is pretty inexpensive
and used directly to cover costs, mostly refreshments. In return to
sponsorship the sponsoring company would be able to have a small table
and a poster in the event lounge and handle out brochures to event
attendees. Please contact me for details at ofers at breach.com or at
054-4431119.

Hi Everyone,

Following the big success of the 1st one, I'm glad to announce the 2nd
OWASP IL mini conference at Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC) on May
21st 2007. The mini conference would be a half day event from around
14:00.

I'd like to officially make a call for speakers and sponsors. As at the
last event we had around 100! attendees, this can be a nice exposure for
both presented and sponsors.

Call for speakers
=============
If you would like to speak at the conference please send me a title and
abstract of your proposed topic as well as few words about yourself.

Sponsorships
=========
Companies who would like to sponsor the event are welcomed to contact me.
This is a not for profit event and sponsorship is pretty inexpensive and
used directly to cover costs, mostly refreshments. In return to
sponsorship the sponsoring company would be able to have a small table and
a poster in the event lounge and handle out brochures to event attendees.
Please contact me for details at ofers at breach.com or at 054-4431119.

Hello list,

I've subscribed to this list a few days ago and haven't had the chance
to introduce myself yet (I don't even know if that's a custom here or
not..) so, my name is Shahar and I work for Zend Technologies as a
technical consultant. As such much of my work revolves around PHP
application security.

Most of my experience is as a PHP developer and consultant, and I've
been traveling all over the world (but mostly in Europe) for Zend
visiting and consulting for some of the larger PHP sites out there. 

I don't know how many PHP people are on this list (I know PHP is not
very strong in Israel) but I am willing to contribute any knowledge I
might have if someone has any questions.

Thanks!

Welcome to the list!
PHP sure needs more "working hands", in order to make the language & the applications more secure.

Hi,
My name is Mickey and I am the R&D Group Leader of Glasshouse Israel
(former integrity-sys).
I will be happy to share my knowledge of secured J2EE application and
Architecture.

I am addressing issues of applicative security solutions in the past
year and the need for knowledge is rapidly growing as the vendors are
enabling more and more agility and simplicity in their products.

If there are guys that wishes to gather on a monthly basis for knowledge
exchange I can contribute our meeting room (and some coffee :-))

Best Regards,
Mickey Ohayon
 
Development Group Leader
