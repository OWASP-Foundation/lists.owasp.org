Subject: [OWASP Israel] research assistant in web-app security and anonymous
	communication
Message-ID: <CAHBw0M92Zn86jJVGvwVF4koKSTxG4VUnvJrfBJ+RAHKgnue=YA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

I am looking for a strong programmer to help us in our research on web-app
security, incl. DoS and privacy attacks, and anonymous communication. A
main part of the job will be to make open-source versions of our research
prototypes. The job can be full or part time, will involve research, and if
desired, could be combined with graduate studies. Candidates should have
(at least) BA/BSc in computer science or related area, with good grades.

To get better picture of our activities, visit my homepage or download some
of our recently published/accepted papers from:
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amir_Herzberg/publications

Please forward to relevant candidates :-)

If interested, pls send me cv, grades and short statement as to what you
are interested in (full/part time, duration). Thanks!

Best, Amir

Subject: [OWASP Israel] Call to action - Samsung Tel-aviv
Message-ID: <CAOyucb2u+TsbiGA+hDwsqPX0B7uFR01PnEapfpv+qwiy91L6hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
For those of you who do not know, Samsung-TLV has launched a few dev-rel
programs that need your help.

*Biz-dev #2*
During Q1 (February-march) we're organising the second event in our series,
aimed to educate developers, designers and managers in the fine arts of
startup creation and in this event we'll focus on cyber aware product
strategy which means that *we're very interested in speakers content* that
could teach the uninitiated about design patterns to use during the initial
product design and architecture in order to avoid gaping cyber-security
holes, later on, in their product's life as well as terms in cyber security
in order to communicate with cyber security professionals.

*Micro-studio*
As part of our effort to enable and facilitate the creation of quality
online content we've built a micro-studio and we're very interested in
aiding you in the creation of professional segments,
We'll help you format it in a way that works best online (we created one
after 6 months of research to create high production values with very
little time since we know how busy you are), record, edit, publish (on free
channels such as youtube) and publicise it.
For an explanation as well as an example  - here
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz36vWgk7LA>.

*Device library and office hours*
We're not only about asking for your help, we'll be glad to assist as well
and have created programs to aid developers and startups in any way we can,
here are 2 prime examples:
*Office hours*
We enlisted top experts in a variety of fields from UX and marketing to
dev-ops and cloud computing who have volunteered free consultation time for
those in need.
If you're interested, please sign up here <http://goo.gl/forms/oMc73CHdpD>.
*Device library*
Since we're a part of Samsung and Google partners we have created a device
library and it's open for you to use on our premises in the Sarona WeWork
offices free of charge with no strings attached.
If you're interested, please sign up here <http://goo.gl/forms/O6gcQcedo1>.

For any additional information please feel free to email Royi Benyossef,
Dev-Rel programs manager for Samsung Tel-aviv <royiby at gmail.com>
Looking forward to see what we'll accomplish together.
