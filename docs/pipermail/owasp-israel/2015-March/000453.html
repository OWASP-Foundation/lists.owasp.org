<PRE>Hi,

Just reminding you to register, if you are planning on coming to the OWASP
chapter meeting. 

Reminder: the meeting will take place on March 30th, at 17:00, in NCR's
office in Raanana, 9 Dafna St.  

 

Registration link: <A HREF="https://owasp-israel-march-2015.eventbrite.com">https://owasp-israel-march-2015.eventbrite.com</A> 

 

Agenda: 

 

-          17:00 - 17:30

Gathering, food &amp; drinks (KOSHER)

 

-          17:30 - 17:40

Opening Note

 

-          17:40 - 18:20

&gt;<i>From Zero to Secure in One Minute
</I>
Nir Valtman, NCR

 

Nir will share with us his talk that he is giving the week before at Black
Hat Asia, on securing IaaS instances in an automated, dynamic manner. 

Nir will also introduce a new open source tool called &quot;Cloudefigo&quot; and
explain how it enables accelerated security lifecycle. We demonstrate how to
launch a pre-configured, already patched instance into an encrypted storage
environment automatically while evaluating their security and mitigating
them automatically if a vulnerability is found. In the live demo, we
leverage Amazon Web Services EC2 Cloud-Init scripts and object storage for
provisioning automated security configuration, integrating encryption,
including secure encryption key repositories for secure server's
communication. The result of those techniques is cloud servers that are
resilient, automatically configured, with reduced attack surface.

 

-          18:20 - 19:00

Shell over what ?! Naughty CDN manipulations 

Roee Cnaan, Cipher Security

 

In this talk, Roee will introduce the unique concept of carrying malicious
traffic over Content Distribution Networks and de-facto whitening and hiding
it by using CDN native features.

 

-          19:00 - 19:20

Coffee break

 

-          19:20 - 20:00

Looking forward to seeing you all there! 

Avi D
