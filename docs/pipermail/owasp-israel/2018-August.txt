Message-ID: <0e1f01d42fbf$70ebfd40$52c3f7c0$@owasp.org>

Hi all! 

 

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference  will take place this year on
Thursday, September 6th, 2018. Our Training Day will be the day before, on
Wednesday, September 5th. This year we are partnering with Tel Aviv
University, to host the conference in the University facility.

 

We need your help! 

AppSec Israel is a free conference, and yet still provides some of the best
content anywhere. But hosting such a large event, with a comfortable venue,
free food and coffee all day long, and other activities - all this costs a
lot of money. 

If your company chooses to support this amazing community, you will get a
wonderful opportunity to show off your company, product, or service to a
fabulous collection of incredibly talented people - whether you are looking
to sell or recruit, this is the right audience for you! 

Sponsorships are very reasonably priced with a variety of options, please
see details here:
https://2018.appsecil.org/assets/AppSecIL_2018_Sponsorships.pdf 

We are getting close to the Conference, and still need more support! Please
contact me (avi.douglen at owasp.org <mailto:avi.douglen at owasp.org> ) by next
week to get in on time! 

 

 

As you all know, OWASP's AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. We
are expecting 700-800 people to attend the conference, and hundreds more for
the training. The Conference will include multiple lecture tracks, TWO
marvelous keynotes, workshops, Capture the Flag competition, and a sponsors
display area for vendors of products and services relevant to Application
Security. We will also have a special Women in AppSec (WIA) event on
Wednesday evening. 

 

Don't miss it this year! All events are free to attend, but you must
register in advance: https://2018.appsecil.org/Register 

 

 

Much thanks to our generous sponsors, for supporting our community and
enabling us to improve the conference, while still keeping it free for
everybody!

Hi everyone,

I would like to let you know about the Cyber Security startups accelerator
that The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) in the UK and O2/Telefonica
is setting up. We are currently looking for startups that could benefit
from the technical support of the NCSC, and explore if the product could be
used by Telefonica/o2, or can be re-sold to our 300M customers worldwide.

Additionally, we are looking to invest free equity 25K and free workspace
with up to 10 great start-ups in the space. If you know of any good
startups that could have a good fit for this, could you please let us
know? *You
can find here the info and application form: https://wayra.co.uk/ncsc/
<https://wayra.co.uk/ncsc/>*

They would be part of a programme that has seen the likes of Elliptic,
StatusToday and Secure Code Warrior involved.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

All the best,

Jaime

Hi All,
The countdown had began, we are less than a week from AppSec Israel 2018!
We are close to our registration limits so I encourage you (if you haven't
done that yet) to register to training/WIA/conference days in -
https://2018.appsecil.org/Register

If you want to help us with conference and training organization please
reach out Hemed Gur-Ary at hemed.gur.ary at owasp.org

We are also planning to have some outstanding activities during the
conference days such as:

   - Capture the Flag activity - lead by Tomer Zait (F5 networks) and
   Nimrod Levy (Scorpiones), registration for teams and individuals is open at
   https://owaspil.ctf.today/ and the contest will start few days before
   the conference!!
   - Resume Review / CV Critique workshop - lead by Guy Barnhart-Magen, So
   many talented young professionals in the AppSec field (and some not so
   young) miss out on great opportunities in which they would excel, and bring
   amazing value to their employers. Often, this happens because of a
   lackluster resume or CV, which does not properly showcase their talent and
   abilities. We are recruiting experienced managers, interviewers, and HR
   professionals to help you improve your resume (reach out Guy at
   barnhart.guy at gmail.com), and offer tips to better show off what you can
   do - and get you in the door at the right employer! Remember to bring your
   resume or CV with you! (Preferably paper printout, as that is easier to
   review).


We are looking forward to seeing you on training day next Wednesday and
conference day next Thursday.

Thanks,

*Or Katz*
