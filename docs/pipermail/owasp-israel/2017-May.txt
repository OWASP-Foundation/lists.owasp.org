(????? ????)

Hi Everybody!

 

I am happy to announce that the annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will
take place this year on Wednesday, October 18, 2017 ? shortly after Sukkot.

 

The conference will be held, as previous years, in The College of Management
(Michlala l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion. 

 

As you all know, OWASP?s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. 

Last year over 650 people attended ? don?t miss it this year! 

 

The Conference will include multiple lecture tracks, and a sponsors display
area for vendors of products and services relevant to Application Security. 

 

This year, we are making some exciting new changes? 

Importantly, this year we will be having TWO days of AppSec! Before the
regular AppSecIL conference, we will have another full day of Security
Training! 

The Training event will be conducted by professional security trainers,
selected by OWASP, and free to attend. 

This Training Day will take place in the same location, on Tuesday, October
17, 2017 and will be a full day of core application security topics, instead
of advanced research, allowing all developers to attend. 

 

And, we have some more surprises for you? We?ll share details as they are
ready! ;-) 

 

We will open the Call for Presentations (CFP) and the Call for Training
(CFT) soon, within the next few weeks ? so start writing up your ideas!

We will also start a sponsorship drive soon, and we are working on updating
the sponsorship model.

In the meantime, if you are interested in volunteering some time and effort,
we could use your help! 

 

I will send out more details soon! 

 

Looking forward to seeing you all!

Subject: 30 days to go for the Owasp Summit 2017

 

Hi Summit Participants (please share the email/info below with your peers)

Also published in this linkedIn article <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-days-go-owasp-summit-2017-dinis-cruz>  and this blog post <http://owaspsummit.org/2017/05/12/Thirty-Day-to-go.html> 

-------

In 30 days (12 June) Owasp will host its 2017 Global Summit <http://owaspsummit.org>  in London <http://owaspsummit.org/website/venue.html>  where hundreds of participants <http://owaspsummit.org/website/participants.html>  will join forces in Working Sessions <http://owaspsummit.org/website/working-sessions.html>  focused on solving hard Application and Cyber Security problems.

This is not a conference with unidirectional presentations. Using the same model as the past two OWASP Summits in Portugal, this 5-day event will be a high-energy experience, during which attendees get the chance to work and collaborate intensively. Every thoroughly prepared working session is geared towards a specific application security challenge and will be focused on actionable outcomes.

With participants flying from all over the world and from major security/development teams, service/product providers and research organizations, this is the place to be to learn and collaborate with industry peers (and even competitors).

The event is split over the following tracks, each focusing on a specific set of challenges:

*	Threat Modeling <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Threat-Model/>  - This is one of the strongest tracks, with most of the core Threat Modeling talent in the world joining forces and collaborating
*	OwaspSAMM <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/OwaspSAMM/>  - This is another track where we have the main contributors and users of this Owasp project participating at the Summit
*	DevSecOps <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/DevSecOps/>  - This track has been generating quite a buzz among participants, since it is addressing real pain points and problems that companies face today
*	Education <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/DevSecOps/>  - Always strong in OWASP, this track ranges from University master degree to how to create the next generation of AppSec professionals
*	Mobile Security <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/>  - Another track where the key Owasp leaders of Mobile-related Owasp projects are participating
*	CISO <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Education/>  - This track reaches a wide audience of CISOs and covers a wide range of CISO-related topics
*	Research <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Research/>  - This track covers really important and interesting research topics (it?s important to look at the future and work on the next generation of Application Security)
*	Agile AppSec <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Agile-AppSec/>  - This is a track driven by a couple participants who really care about Agile and want to find better ways to integrate it with AppSec practices
*	Security Crowdsourcing <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Security-Crowdsourcing/>  - This is a track that is focused on scaling AppSec activities via internal and external crowdsourcing
*	Owasp Project?s Summit <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Project-Summit/>  - Last but not least, this track has 31x Working Sessions directly related to an Owasp Project (with most having the Project Leader participating)

Each track?s Working Session will be expected to deliver something tangible and usable by the Owasp community (whitepaper, documentation, play-books, code, action-plans, books, decisions, etc.) and all Participants are expected to participate actively in Working Sessions (as an organizer or contributor).

Owasp Summit?s Schedules are different from normal conferences, since they are focused on maximizing the Participant?s time and Working Sessions they want to be actively involved. The current Schedule is under development and will be released in the next weeks.

Here are some of the Working Sessions that will be worked on at the Summit:

*	Application Security BSc/Masters Curriculum Design <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Education/AppSec-BSc-Masters-Curriculum-Design.html>  , Creating AppSec Teams <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Education/Creating-AppSec-Teams.html> 
*	Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet <http://owaspsummit.org/2017/05/12/Working-Sessions/Threat-Model/Threat-Modeling-Cheat-Sheet.html> 
*	Software Defined Everything (SDx) <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Education/Software-Defined-Everything-%28SDx%29.html> 
*	Using ML and AI to detect Attacks <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Research/Using-ML-and-AI-to-detect-attacks.html> 
*	Agile Practices for Security Teams <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Agile-AppSec/Agile-Practices-for-Security-Teams.html>  , Integrating Security into a Portfolio Kanban <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Agile-AppSec/Integrating-Security-into-a-Portfolio-Kanban.html>  , Using Security Risks to Measure Agile Practices <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Agile-AppSec/Using-Security-Risks-to-Measure-Agile-Practices.html> 
*	Scaling Static Analysis Reviews and Deployments <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Tools/Scaling-Static-Analysis-Reviews-and-Deployments.html>  , NextGen Security Scanners <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Tools/NextGen-SecurityScanners.html> 
*	GDPR and DPO AppSec implications <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/CISO/> , Cyber Insurance <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/CISO/>  , InfoSec Warranties and Guarantees <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/CISO/InfoSec-Warranties-and-Guarantees.html> 
*	Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/MSTG.html> 
*	Implications of Owasp Top 10 2017 <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Owasp-Top-10-2017> , Data behind Owasp Top 10 2017 <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Owasp-Top-10-2017/Data-behind-OWASP-Top-10-2017.html> 
*	Juice Shop <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Project-Summit/Juice-Shop.html>  , NodeGoat <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Project-Summit/NodeGoat.html>  , Testing Guide v5 <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Project-Summit/Testing-Guide-v5.html>  , Application Security Guide for CISO <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/CISO/Application-Security-Guide-for-CISO.html>  , OWASP Risk Rating Management Project <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Project-Summit/Risk-Rating-Management.html> 
*	Crowdsourcing Security Knowledge <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Security-Crowdsourcing/Crowdsourcing-Security-Knowledge.html>  , Responsible Disclosure <http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Security-Crowdsourcing/Responsible-disclosure.html> 

In order to attract as much talent as possible to the Summit, the Summit Tickets <http://owaspsummit.org/website/buy-ticket.html>  were kept at a low price. A 5x 8h daily ticket costs ?400 (i.e. without accommodation) and a 5x 24h daily ticket costs ?1,200 (i.e. with 4-night accommodation), with a 10% discount (for 5 to 9 tickets) and a 20% discount (for 10+ tickets). 1x daily 8h tickets are also available at ?100 and 24h tickets at ?300.

A key factor of the Owasp Summit?s high level productivity and collaboration is the Lodge/Villa accommodation model, where participants will stay, and be literally involved in AppSec/Security conversations and debates from morning till dusk (a number of daily and evening Working Sessions will occur in the Lodges)

Some companies are bringing larger teams to the Summit (with a dedicated Lodge/Villa) where they can double-up as team-building, strategic planning and offsite events.

The Owasp Summit is going to be the largest concentration of AppSec and Security talent focused on solving problems in 2017.

Gleb Keselman, Development Manager, Intuit Data Protection Services

Intuit's internal key management service served, just over a month ago, to
encrypt the tax and financial history of more than 30 million American
citizens. Overall, this required 2 billion cryptographic operations to
encrypt and decrypt application data. 

 

Scaling a key management service requires a combination of system-level best
practices along with with novel cryptographic solutions. We will discuss how
we are able to achieve a high level of security, combined with ease of use
for developers and great performance.  

 

".well then, we have an OWASP Top 10 opportunity"

Josh Grossman, Comsec Group

A couple of months ago the draft 2017 version of the OWASP Top 10 list was
released and with it came some surprises and some controversy.

 

Whilst the Top 10 is very widely used, many people do not realise how it is
actually produced and what it is based on. When I dug into the process
behind it, the picture became even more concerning. 

 

In this session, I will explain the basis of the latest Top 10 list,
summarise the reaction to the recent release and give my take on what I
think should be done next. I will also suggest how we can use the Top 10
list and other OWASP projects to give better application security advice and
also how we can contribute back. 

 

Cloud Security for Startups - From A to E(xit)

Shahar Maor, Information Security Manager, Outbrain 

Eitan Satmary, Security Architect, Wix

Founding a startup is a hard work. The daily roller coaster can exhaust you
fast. And on top of that, you need to cope with information security
challenges, compliance and tough questions from customers. 

 

The Israeli chapter of the Cloud Security Alliance is helping the local
startup community cope with those challenges. Over the last couple of years
we have identified a gap in the InfoSec knowledge and produced a Best
Practices manual, designed for startups that rely on Cloud infrastructure. 

 

This talk is a digest of a paper created by the Israeli Chapter of the CSA
to help Software-as-a-Service startups (SaaS-SUs) gain and maintain client
trust, by building solid security foundations. Link to the paper:
