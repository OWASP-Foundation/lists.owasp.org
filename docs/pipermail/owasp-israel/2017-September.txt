Hi Everybody!

 

As announced, the annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference
<https://appsecil.org/>  will take place this year on Wednesday, October 18,
2017 ? shortly after Sukkot.

There will also be an additional Training Day, on Tuesday, October 17, 2017
and will be a full day of core application security topics, allowing all
developers to attend. 

 

The Conference and Training will be held, as in previous years, at The
College of Management (Michlala l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion. 

Free registration is required: https://appsecil.org/Register

 

As you all know, OWASP?s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. 

Last year over 650 people attended, and we expect over 700 this year ? don?t
miss it! 

 

The AppSec Israel 2017 Conference will have two lecture tracks from an
amazing group of speakers, and additional activities such as a Capture the
Flag competition. 

We also host a sponsors pavilion with vendor booths to promote the latest
advances in security technology relevant to application security and
developers. Many of our sponsors are also recruiting. 

 

The Training Day on Tuesday, October 17, 2017 will be a full day of
application security topics, aimed at software developers, QA engineers, and
anyone new to the AppSec field.

The Training event will be conducted by a professional security trainer,
hired by OWASP Global, and free to attend. 

Specific details are being finalized, and will be published shortly at
https://appsecil.org/Training. 

 

Both the Conference and Training are free to attend, but registration is
required! 

Please register here: https://appsecil.org/Register 

 

The final agenda will be published shortly at https://appsecil.org/Agenda,

Subject: [OWASP Israel] The Rumours Of Our Hacking Have Been Greatly
	Exaggerated
Message-ID: <044b01d32b8a$da87f220$8f97d660$@owasp.org>

Good morning, 

 

Some of you may have encountered a scary warning sign, when trying to access
our site, warning of malware and similar unpleasantness. We?re sorry about
this, but here is what you need to know: 

 

First thing: 

The AppSecIL website has NOT been hacked, no credit cards were stolen, and
no animals harmed. 

In fact, it is literally a static, automatically generated site ? if anyone
is interested in the details, we?d be happy to share. 

 

Second: 

The AppSecIL website, and all OWASP websites, do NOT host or redirect to any
type of malware, phishing pages, or other malicious websites. 

 

Our mission, as you know, is to improve the security of all websites,
everywhere. Injecting malware into our users? machines would not serve that
purpose; nor would allowing a simple website to be attacked so easily. 

 

Third: 

This is NOT a trick test, to make sure you?re ?l33t? enough to register for
a security conference ;-) 

 

So, what actually happened? 

 

Details below, but if you just want to register, you can still do this
directly on EventBrite: https://appsecil2017.eventbrite.com 

 

 

Here?s what we know so far: 

 

This is actually not a problem with our site at all, but a miscategorization
by Google, likely due to incorrectly configured intercepting VPNs. 

 

Our site uses Let?s Encrypt certificates for TLS authentication, as many
other sites do. Unfortunately many VPNs do not recognize this CA as
legitimate, so if you are behind a such corporate network that implements
decrypt-and-scan, you may have received errors earlier in the day. It is
even possible Chrome browsers encountering this would report these spoofing
attempts to Google, which would interpret this as a forged site (though this
has yet to be confirmed). 

 

Coincidentally, this was published just yesterday:
https://www.blog.google/topics/safety-security/safe-browsing-protecting-more
-3-billion-devices-worldwide-automatically/ 

In short, Google just made a big push (with AI & Machine learning) to get 3
Billion devices protected and uses machine learning 'magic' to protect the
realm. 

 

So, a site that registered a domain name, launched and got a Let's Encrypt
TLS cert all on the same day - hmmm. 

In addition the VPN issue just mentioned, with the likely browser reports,
may have been enough to push the AppSecIL site over the malicious threshold.

 

Again, some of this is just conjecture at this point, though after several
hours of investigation by OWASP staff and volunteers. Currently we have
opened a resolution request, and are waiting to hear back from Google. 

 

Bottom line: 

This was a false positive, caused by faulty crowdsourced information and
untuned machine learning, likely influenced by misconfigured networks and
questionable security products. 

Now, if only there were somewhere to hear about improving security products
and hacking machine learning? :D 

 

What should you do now? 

There is nothing for you to do about the website at this point, unless you
want to use a different browser. This will be fixed by Google at some point
in the next few hours. 

In the meantime, you can register right now! At
https://appsecil2017.eventbrite.com 

 

One other thing you can do, is talk to your network operators and system
administrators, and verify that their devices are all configured properly,
to accept Let?s Encrypt certificates and to stop breaking TLS needlessly. 

 

Again, sorry this happened, and we?re on it.

Hi Everybody!

 

As announced, the annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference
<https://appsecil.org/>  will take place this year on Wednesday, October 18,
2017 ? shortly after Sukkot.

There will also be an additional Training Day, on Tuesday, October 17, 2017
and will be a full day of core application security topics, allowing all
developers to attend. 

 

The Conference and Training will be held, as in previous years, at The
College of Management (Michlala l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion. 

Free registration is required: https://appsecil.org/Register

 

As you all know, OWASP?s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. 

Last year over 650 people attended, and we expect over 700 this year ? don?t
miss it! 

 

The AppSec Israel 2017 Conference will have two lecture tracks from an
amazing group of speakers, and additional activities such as a Capture the
Flag competition. 

We also host a sponsors pavilion with vendor booths to promote the latest
advances in security technology relevant to application security and
developers. Many of our sponsors are also recruiting. 

 

The Training Day on Tuesday, October 17, 2017 will be a full day of
application security topics, aimed at software developers, QA engineers, and
anyone new to the AppSec field.

The Training event will be conducted by a professional security trainer,
hired by OWASP Global, and free to attend. 

Specific details are being finalized, and will be published shortly at
https://appsecil.org/Training. 

 

Both the Conference and Training are free to attend, but registration is
required! 

Please register here: https://appsecil.org/Register 

 

The final agenda will be published shortly at https://appsecil.org/Agenda,

We are grateful to our sponsors for supporting our community and enabling us
to improve the conference, while still keeping it free for everybody!

Conference, and it is free to attend after registration
<https://appsecil.org/Register> . 

 

This hands-on, crash course in application security is NOT for security
experts with many years of experience, but for those who need it the most:
developers, QA engineers, and beginners in the AppSec field!

 

This crash course trains the participants in the basic toolset, in
penetration testing skills and in secure development practices. 

It will cover the methodologies, common toolsets and over 7+ different high
impact attack vectors, as well as the 

code-level techniques required to mitigate these attacks.

 

The Training aims to introduce the audience into the field of
application-level attacks and white-hat hacking 

methodologies, as well as the equivalent secure coding best-practices, and
provide the basic tools, understanding 

and processes required for assessing the security of modern web
applications.

 

Its aim is to enable trainees get the initial understanding and hands-on
skills required to find their path in the appsec field, 

whether as an appsec professional or as a developer of secure, resilient,
and robust code.
