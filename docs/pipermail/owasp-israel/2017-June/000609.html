<PRE>Hi everyone! 

 

A quick reminder about our next chapter meeting for OWASP Israel, this
Tuesday, June 20, 2017. Starting at 17:00, it will likely finish between
20:00 and 20:30. 

 

The meeting will be hosted by Intuit Israel, their address is HaHarash St 4,
Hod Hasharon. Building C, 2nd Floor - there is a map with directions and
parking instructions here:

g 

 

Attending the meeting is free of course, but advance registration is
required: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/240224137/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/240224137/</A> 

 

IMPORTANT: If you will be attending the meeting, please update your meetup
details with your full name ASAP - this is required for security purposes
and to enter the parking lot. 

If you choose not to update your full name, you should at least print out
the invitation and bring it along with you as it will be difficult for the
security guard to grant access with neither one of these. 

 

Registration will be closed Monday at noon, please register and update your
full name before then. 

 

Hope to see you all there!

Avi D 

 

 

 

Agenda: 

 

17:00 - Gathering, food &amp; drinks

 

17:30 - Opening note

 

17:45 - Encrypting Data at Scale

Gleb Keselman, Development Manager, Intuit Data Protection Services

Intuit's internal key management service served, just over a month ago, to
encrypt the tax and financial history of more than 30 million American
citizens. Overall, this required 2 billion cryptographic operations to
encrypt and decrypt application data. 

 

Scaling a key management service requires a combination of system-level best
practices along with with novel cryptographic solutions. We will discuss how
we are able to achieve a high level of security, combined with ease of use
for developers and great performance.  

 

18:30 - &quot;.well then, we have an OWASP Top 10 opportunity&quot;

Josh Grossman, Comsec Group

A couple of months ago the draft 2017 version of the OWASP Top 10 list was
released and with it came some surprises and some controversy.

 

Whilst the Top 10 is very widely used, many people do not realise how it is
actually produced and what it is based on. When I dug into the process
behind it, the picture became even more concerning. 

 

In this session, I will explain the basis of the latest Top 10 list,
summarise the reaction to the recent release and give my take on what I
think should be done next. I will also suggest how we can use the Top 10
list and other OWASP projects to give better application security advice and
also how we can contribute back. 

 

19:15 - Coffee Break 

 

19:30 - Cloud Security for Startups - From A to E(xit)

Shahar Maor, Information Security Manager, Outbrain 

Eitan Satmary, Security Architect, Wix

Founding a startup is a hard work. The daily roller coaster can exhaust you
fast. And on top of that, you need to cope with information security
challenges, compliance and tough questions from customers. 

 

The Israeli chapter of the Cloud Security Alliance is helping the local
startup community cope with those challenges. Over the last couple of years
we have identified a gap in the InfoSec knowledge and produced a Best
Practices manual, designed for startups that rely on Cloud infrastructure. 

 

This talk is a digest of a paper created by the Israeli Chapter of the CSA
to help Software-as-a-Service startups (SaaS-SUs) gain and maintain client
trust, by building solid security foundations. Link to the paper:
