Subject: [OWASP Israel] Cyber mentor related
Message-ID: <CANM5d8dro1=juqgztQc9qV8dGZcPeEy9-G8Y1r0zMQHhfs46=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

TL;DL:
On behalf of Hamakor, I'm looking for a programmer who is willing to mentor
someone in the next OSS hack night. He wants to contribute to an OSS cyber
related project. The next night is in th 13.3.2019:
https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-and-Free-Software-in-Israel/events/nqzqrqyzfbpb/

About Hamakor hack nights:
I'm helping organizing Hamakor <https://www.hamakor.org.il/en/> (foundation
for spreading OSS in Israel) hack nights. Someone contacted us and asked if
there is an OSS cyber mentor available.
Hamakor monthly OSS nights serve as an introduction for people who would
like to contribute to OSS.
Do you know anyone who can help?

Thanks,

Shay Gover

Hi, your account has been infected! Renew the password this time!

You do not know anything about me and you may be probably surprised for what reason you're reading this particular letter, proper?

I'm hacker who exploitedyour emailand all devicesnot so long ago.
Never try out to msg me or alternatively seek for me, it's impossible,
because I forwarded you this message using YOUR hacked account.

I've installed special program on the adult videos (porno) site
and guess that you visited this site to have fun (you understand what I mean).

While you have been keeping an eye on video clips,
your internet browser started out to act like a RDP (Remote Control)
having a keylogger that provided me access to your screen and network camera.

Then, my softobtainedall information.
You have typed passcodes on the online resources you visited, I caught them.
Surely, you are able change each of them, or have already modified them.
However it doesn't matter, my program renews needed data regularly.

What actually I have done?
I generated a reserve copy of every your system. Of all the files and each contact.
I formed a dual-screen videofile.
The first part displays the film that you were watching (you have got an interesting preferences, ahahhh...),
and the second screen displays the recording from your own camera.

What exactly should you do?
Clearly, I think, $755(USD) will be a fair price for our small riddle.
You will make the deposit by bitcoins
(if you do not understand this, go searching "how to purchase bitcoin" in any search engine).

My bitcoin wallet address: 1PAcoXVyzBDRryyg3MAmBQhDuofNYu55Uo
(It is cAsE sensitive, so copy and paste it).

Important:
You will have 2 days in order to make the payment.
(I have an unique pixel in this letter, and at the moment I understand that you've read through this email).

To tracethe reading of a messageand the actionsin it, I utilizea Facebook pixel.

Thanks to them. (That whichis usedfor the authorities may helpus.)

In case I fail to get bitcoins,
I shall undoubtedly send your video files to each of your contacts, along with relatives, co-workers, etc?

Subject: [OWASP Israel] Call for Sponsors - Global AppSec Tel Aviv
Message-ID: <07f001d4d4ad$2d3166b0$87943410$@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone! 

 

As previously announced, the OWASP Israel chapter will be hosting OWASP
Global AppSec Tel Aviv, on May 26-30, 2019.

3 days of Training and other activities, and then 2 days of exciting content
at the Conference! We expect hundreds of OWASP leaders and security
professionals worldwide to be joining us, with over 600 participating. Our
theme this year is "AppSec: The Community of Innovation". 

Website: https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/ 

 

As you probably know, OWASP is a global, non-profit organization, supported
by its members and our events. 

But we need your help to support us and help make this conference a success!


 

A Global AppSec sponsor booth is an excellent place to reach many of your
target audience, with so many of our industry attending - security
researchers, CISOs, appsec practitioners, security-aware developers and
managers. And not just from Israel, at this event we will be hosting several
hundred from the international community, from Europe, US, and the rest of
the world. 

This is the place to reach them all! 

 

This is really a great opportunity to reach a wider, global audience -
details on our sponsorship options here:
https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/docs/Global_AppSec_Tel_Aviv_2019_Sponsorshi
p_Opportunities.pdf

 

I should point out that this is a separate, and very different type of event
from our usual AppSec Israel regional conference, with a much higher
production value, and a week's worth of events and activities. As fabulous
as our regular AppSecIL usually is, this is now a one-time opportunity to
have this Global event right here in our community! 

 

I look forward to discussing with you how your company can support the
event, and the community.

 

Cheers! 

Avi D

Hi List,
As some of you saw a spam email was sent to the entire list, this email was
not approved by list moderators and it was probably an issue of the mailman
system that OWASP global are working on improving. As part of changes
driven by the global organization we will move to google emails system in
the next few weeks.

I apologize for the inconvenience

Message-ID: <CAPHzLZpf5TVBHwmmOqzW0LcE_-MUE5uq6TYu-ci1WdBhBW60VQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a reminder that registration for this event at the end of May is now
open here: https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/registration/registration-locals
!
(Note that prices on that page include VAT)

This is the first time a Global OWASP conference has come to Israel and it
is important that we make it a success! For more information about how this
conference is different to the regular AppSec Israel conference, you can
see my slides from the last chapter meeting here:
https://www.slideshare.net/JoshGrossmanCISSP/intro-to-global-appsec-tel-aviv-137272294


I particularly want to highlight the excellent set of training courses we
have on the programme. Many of the trainers who are coming here will be
going on to deliver their courses at Black Hat, Hack In Paris and other
major conferences (at a higher cost!).

Places on the training courses will be limited so I would strongly
recommend registering early to avoid missing out!

Any questions, feel free to speak to me or any of the local board members!

Thanks,

Josh
