Subject: [OWASP-Israel] Reminder! OWASP Israeli chapter meeting next Wednesday (8/6) at 17:30
Message-ID: <01FE74AA95A56946ADF84A4976618B9701438EA9@mammoth.utopiasystems.net>

Hi Everybody,

 

I want to remind you that the first meeting of the Israeli OWASP chapter
will be held on June 8th at 17:30, in Breach Security offices in
Herzelia. You can find details about the meeting and the agenda at
http://www.owasp.org/local/israel.html
<http://www.owasp.org/local/israel.html> . Until now the responses were
overwhelming and I think that it would be a great meeting. By
participating in this meeting you will have a unique chance to take part
in forming the chapter and defining its goals and activities in the
future.

 

Participation is free and open to all, but please inform us (mail me at
ofers at breach.com) that you are coming so that we will be better
prepared.

 

 

Thanks You

~ Ofer

Hey All,

I am writing this mail in order to thank Ofer for the organization, hosting and lecturing of this event. As I mentioned in my email to Ofer, I see Israel as technological pioneers in application security, having some of the world's best experts in this field. I think an Israeli OWASP chapter is a great initiative and hope it will continue taking place, contributing to all parties involved, and the security community itself. Also, this is naturally the place to thank Ariel for a great lecture I enjoyed alot.

Hi All,

 

Sorry if you get this twice as I'm sending a similar mail to both the
OWASP IL mailing list and directly to people who participated in
yesterday's meeting.

 

Yesterday we held the 1st Israeli OWASP chapter meeting. I certainly
enjoyed it very much and feedback from people. After the holiday I'll
contact everyone said he wants to be active in the chapter and we will
meet and discuss future activities.

 

I'll post the presentation on lines in the coming days

Subject: [OWASP-WEBSCARAB] Scripting hooks

Hi folks,

I'm looking for suggestions for places to insert scripting hooks.

Currently, if you go to the Tools menu, and select Script Manager, you 
will see only 3 hooks defined under the Proxy plugin:

* Allow connection
* Intercept request
* Intercept response

The first allows you to refuse connections from a particular IP address,

or based on something else you already know when the initial connect is 
made, such as time of day.

The second allows you to modify requests, similarly to the beanshell 
proxy plugin, and the third does the same for responses.

One additional hook that has been suggested is an "addConversation" hook

at the framework level. This would fire immediately after a conversation

has been performed, but before it gets saved in the model, and passed on

to all the other plugins. A script executing on this hook might refuse 
to add images, or other "opaque" content such as sounds or PDF's to the 
overall model, while still allowing the operator to view such content 
through the proxy, or via the manual-request plugins.

The intention is to remove the proxy beanshell plugin, as well as the 
rest of the Misc plugins, and leave only the ManualEdit plugin. The rest

of the Misc plugins can be implemented as scripts listening to the 
various hooks, and can be enabled or disabled as desired.

Naturally, I plan to improve the Script Manager dialogs and interface 
significantly before removing existing functionality. ;-)

So, what other hooks would be useful?

Rogan
