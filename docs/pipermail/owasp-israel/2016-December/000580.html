<PRE>Hi!
Next week we&#8217;re doing SecSessions #3, with 4 interesting talks.
Details &amp; Registration here:
<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/SecSessions-Cybersecurity-Meetup/events/236088394/">https://www.meetup.com/SecSessions-Cybersecurity-Meetup/events/236088394/</A>
Beer &amp; Pizza will be served :)
The Talks:
Want to reveal APT attacks? C&amp;C traffic is a good place to start.
Moshe Zioni, Security Research Manager - Verint
Command &amp; Control traffic detection is NOT the only way to address advance persistent threat attacks. However, C&amp;C traffic is one of the most promising ways to reveal APTs since the traffic is always in place. Of course, you have to know how to find it. Let&#8217;s try to understand the best way. Classic techniques for C&amp;C discovery include black listing and behavior signatures. Anomaly detection is a newer approach but still not fully effective.


Meanwhile, the C&amp;C techniques are evolving as well and getting harder to detect. Contemporary malware uses various protocols for calling home, including communications over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, ICMP, raw TCP and UDP. Even the IRC protocol in use by malware more than a decade and half ago has gotten a second wind. In recent years, malware developers have started to use social networks as part of their C&amp;C platforms, which further complicates the detection.


We&#8217;ll be covering various detection techniques, their pros and cons, and how these techniques meet contemporary requirements. Supervised machine learning is an area on which we&#8217;ll especially focus. Multitudes of attackers have had to overcome similar obstacles to establish secret cover channels. In many cases, C&amp;C traffic look similar across completely different malware families. By implementing supervised machine learning techniques, it&#8217;s possible to hunt these particularities and reveal unknown C&amp;C channels with a high level of confidence. We&#8217;ll demonstrate the concepts and explain how unknown malware C&amp;C traffic can be detected based on previous knowledge. Attendees will walk away with an educated view of the techniques required to detect C&amp;C and how to implement them.


Security in Car2Car communication
Yoni Kahana, CyberSecurity Group Manager, GM
We will review the basic concept of the car-to-car communication in Europe that will be used to share collaborative information between cars.
Can your car be manipulated via this channel?
Can it abused to create artificial traffic jams?
Will it enable tracking your car?

These security and privacy concerns and others with the solutions and the tradeoffs will be discussed.


I know what you saw last minute
Ran Dubin, Researcher, Ben Gurion University &amp; Seculert
Every day, hundreds of millions of Internet users view videos online - in particular on mobile phones whose numbers are clearly going to increase. Currently, most of the video streaming web sites including YouTube are using HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS). Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is de facto standard method for HAS. In DASH, each quality representation is encoded in to variable bit rates (VBRs). VBR vary the amount of output data per time segment and does not attempt to control the output bit rate of the encoder, so that the distortion will not vary significantly. DASH often uses HTTP byte range mode. In this mode, the byte range of each segment request can be different. This depends on the client's network conditions and playout buffer levels. Previous research has shown that information can be extracted from multimedia streams. Saponas et al. uncovered security issues with consumer electronic gadgets that enables information retrieval such as video titles classification. So if it has already been done, what's new?


Since these works have been conducted, there have been several changes in video traffic over the internet:Adaptive byte range selection over HTTP - This means that a single title download from the same quality will look different each time. VBR adaptive streaming with multiple representation layers - Each title can be represent by multiple quality without explicit order. HTTP version 2 - new secure and HTTP multiplexed session network protocol makes the classification much more difficult.


This paper presents an algorithm for encrypted HTTP adaptive video streaming title classification. By Exploiting the HAS multi bit-rate encoding, data mining, network reverse engineering and machine learning, we demonstrate that current network encryption efforts are not enough in order to protect user content anonymity and their viewing titles can be recognized. We evaluated our algorithm on a new YouTube popular videos dataset that was collected from the internet under real-world network conditions. Our algorithm's classification accuracy is 98%.


AliBobo and the 360 thieves
Matan Lion, Security Researcher, Imperva
&quot;Open Sesame&quot; were the two magic words used by Ali Baba from the folk tale &#8220;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&#8221; to open the entrance to the treasure hideout. It took an experienced attacker, Alibobo 360, the same amount of effort and ease to compromise a cluster of web servers for a coordinated, lucrative phishing campaign.
Recently, while checking his work emails, one of the researchers at Imperva Defense Center received an email including what seemed to be a legitimate Adobe PDF Online login request. Adobe PDF Online is the required software for viewing online attachments especially if one needs to edit a document. Even though the login screen appeared authentic and convincing, the unauthorized URL related to the attachment triggered enough paranoia for us to perform an in-depth security investigation.
Following the trail of the phishing attempt, we discovered an extensive network executing the phishing campaign that included exploiting compromised web servers to be used as relays between the victims and the attacker. In this presentation we will investigate the phishing campaign from both the victims&#8217; and the attacker&#8217;s perspectives, analyzing the profiles of the victims and the techniques of the attacker. We will also estimate the attacker&#8217;s financial costs to understand how profitable the campaign might have been.
