Hi Everybody! 

 

The OWASP AppSec Israel conference last week was a huge success - over 650
people attended! 

Thanks to everybody who participated and supported us! 

 

>From all that I've heard so far, it was as interesting and exciting as it
seemed to me!

I hope everyone had a positive experience, and I would be happy to hear
about it (in addition to the feedback forms, which were sent to all those
who attended). 

 

Only a few of the presentations are online yet, but we are collecting the
rest of them and will upload them as soon as we can. 

They are available at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2016_Presentations , and the
rest will be there within a few days. 

 

Videos of all of the talks were also recorded, and these will also be
uploaded and available online shortly. 

 

A collection of photos is available here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0_K8tApcXxmVzBkcDNFUmt5S0U (thanks
to Liran Vaknin). 

If you have any other pictures, videos, etc of the conference - please send
me a link to them (avi.douglen at owasp.org <mailto:avi.douglen at owasp.org> ) to
share on the web page!

 

Some numbers about the Conference: 

-         Over 650 attended  - continuing our steady growth! 

-         17 Sponsors - 3 Platinum, 6 Gold, 6 Silver, and 2 Community
Supporters.

-         15 Booths

-         16 Track sessions (in 2 auditoriums)

-         1 Panel

-         19 Speakers 

-         1 Capture the Flag competition 

-         4 CTF winners

-         1 Raffle 

-         3 coffee breaks and one lunch :) 

 

As was mentioned several times - we love feedback! We really want to hear
your perspective and experience, so that we can plan next year's conference
to be even more awesome. 

 

Our thanks go out to: 

-         A special thanks to Dr. Yehuda Elmaliach and the College of
Management and staff (Shiran, Ety, Yehuda, et al), who graciously offered to
host us again this year. 

-         Thank you to all the sponsors that enabled us to make the most out
of the conference, without worrying about hunger, thirst, or caffeine
deficiency. 

-         Thanks to all the speakers, who made it all worthwhile - and, in
the words of several attendees, "even better than the international
conferences like BlackHat and RSAC" :)

-         Thanks also to all those who submitted a proposal for a talk - and
there were so many excellent proposals! Though we were unfortunately not
able to fit in all the talks this year, I hope we can entice you all to join
us at one of the next chapter meetings. I hope you all continue to
contribute, and that we'll be able to hear you next time! 

-         Thanks to all the volunteers who helped facilitate flow and timing
- Lavie BB, Michael Furman, Liran Vaknin, Isaac Goldstand, Israel Ben Harus,
Emette Douglen, and anyone else I may have forgotten! 

-         Thanks to Sarah Manning and the rest of her Tikshoret.biz crew,
Yael Lampert and David Wellins, without whom the Conference would have
descended into a steaming chaos of disorganized hellfire (as usually
happens). 

-         And many thanks to all the rest of the team and staff that helped
organize the event - Shiran Cohen, Ety Amram, Or Katz, Erez Metula, Hemed
Gur Ary, Ofer Maor, and Yossi Oren!
