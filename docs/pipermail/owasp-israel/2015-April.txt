Agenda:

Gathering, food & drinks (KOSHER)

 

-          17:30 - 17:40

Opening Note

 

-          17:40 - 18:20

Collateral DDoS

Ido Leibovich, Imperva

 

Application Layer DDoS attacks are well known and well-studied for many
years, with numerous attack vectors varying in their origin and in their
methods, but sharing the basic objective to deprave the ability of the
target application to serve its clients. 

In this session we will present a very unique DDoS attack that we stumbled
upon when monitoring web traffic, whose targets are innocent applications,
which seem to be chosen at random. 

We will show how DNS corruption operations allegedly made as part of the
so-called "Great Firewall of China", the well-known censorship system of
Chinese authorities, with the peer-to-peer unmanaged nature of the
BitTorrent ecosystem, result in massive and synchronized HTTP traffic
targeted to arbitrary victim applications, and in highly effective DDoS
attack on these applications. 

We will show how this attack looks like from the victim side, including the
timeline and the volume of the attack traffic. 

We will also isolate the parts of the BitTorrent protocol that make it prone
to become the ground for such attacks.

 

-          18:20 - 19:10
Transcending From Digital to Physical

Yaniv Simsolo, Palantir Security

 

The next generation of attacks aimed at the physical realm, can be attained
using the digital realm. The origins of hacking were aimed at the physical,
long since have been replaced with money gaining hacks, are back with us.

Since the Moore's Law is becoming invalid, hackers possess greater abilities
than ever. Re-aiming the guns towards the physical realm is highly
lucrative. We will discuss and demonstrate attack vectors on the digital
realm aimed at the physical realm.

 

-          19:10 - 19:30

Coffee break

 

-          19:30 - 20:15 

Shell over what ?! Naughty CDN manipulations 

Roee Cnaan, Cipher Security

 

In this talk, Roee will introduce the unique concept of carrying malicious
traffic over Content Distribution Networks and de-facto whitening and hiding
it by using CDN native features.

 

Cheers!

Avi D
