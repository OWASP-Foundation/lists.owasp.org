<PRE>Hey Everybody! 

 

I know you haven't heard from me in this forum in a while now. 

We were trying to set up an OWASP chapter meeting sometime this month,
unfortunately our planned venue fell through and they are not able to host
us this month. 

 

So we are looking for a company that would like to host an OWASP chapter
meeting! 

In case you're not familiar, this is a technical evening, usually after
17:00 for a few hours, with a few presentations for security pros on
research, methodologies, really any typical OWASP fare. 

We typically have between 120-150 attending, so it would need to be a fairly
large sized room with at least those many seats, audio/visual support, etc.
Besides the physical location the only other expense is typically some light
refreshments. 

 

If you or your company have the facilities to host us, I would love to hear
from you as soon as possible!

Please get in touch with me directly. 

 

 

In addition, we would be happy to receive additional proposals for talks at
this (or any other) meeting, you can just email me your topic directly. 

 

Thanks! 

Avi D
