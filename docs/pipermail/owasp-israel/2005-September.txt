Hello Everybody,

To start the new OWASP IL year, I would like to invite you to present a
lecture in one of the OWASP IL meetings this year. If you think that you
have something interesting to say about application security, OWASP IL
is the best place to present your lecture.

*** Please also mark in your diaries that OWASP IL next meeting will be
held on September 21st at 17:00, most probably in Comsec office in
Petach-Tikva. More details will follow ***

Some interesting subjects might be:
- New application security vulnerabilities
- Real world stories of app layer attacks or pen testing
- Solutions to the application security issue (but see the commercial
restriction below)
- Secure development & secure development tools
- Security in specific environments such as dot net.

The OWASP charter prevents us from having commercially oriented lectures
in our meetings. As a presenter you would be allowed to name the company
you work for and use company slides.

So if you are interested please send me the title and a three line
summary of your lecture and I contact you to discuss it.

About OWASP & OWASP IL
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an all-volunteer
group that produces free, professional-quality, open-source
documentation, tools, and standards. OWASP IL is the Israeli chapter of
OWASP. OWASP IL holds periodical meetings in which presentations are
given on topics such as application security vulnerabilities, testing,
solutions and events. 

Web Application Security is considered a very important issue in Israel,
as shown by the large number of Israeli vendors developing web
application security solutions, and we are sure that OWASP-Israel will
provide leading edge information to its participants and guests. 

Participation in OWASP-Israel meetings, mailing list and other
activities is free and open to all. Refer to
http://www.owasp.org/local/israel.html for more details.

Subject: [OWASP-Israel] Early Registration Ending Soon: 2nd US OWASP AppSec Conference - Oct 11-12 - Near DC
Message-ID: <01FE74AA95A56946ADF84A4976618B9701C914F0@mammoth.utopiasystems.net>



I just wanted to remind everyone that early registration for the OWASP
conference ends on Sept 9th (this Friday). On Sept 10. the registration 
fee
will increase by $50 for both Standard and Government registrants. Full
details on the conference are available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc.html

Also, I have been informed by the staff at NIST that there will be NO 
ONSITE
REGISTRATION. Thus, you must register for the conference by Oct 10th via

the
website. We then have to provide a list of registrants to the Guards at
NIST. You will be required to provide them with picture ID. If you are 
on
the registration list, they will then let you enter the facility to the
conference building where you can pick up your conference badge.

Also, the training class on Oct 10, the day before the conference, is 
almost
full so I encourage anyone interested in signing up to do so soon. If 
there
are enough registrants over the course max, we might open up a second
offering of the class at the same date and location. However, we need to
decide this soon so we can reserve the room. So please register for the
course as soon as possible if you are interested to ensure you get a 
spot.

Registration info from previous announcements repeated below:

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a non-profit charitable organization, and with
NIST's sponsorship, OWASP has been able to keep the cost to $300 per 
seat if
you are able to register prior to Sept. 10, 2005. The cost to government
employees is only $250 prior to Sept. 10th.

Registration information is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/docroot/owasp/Registration/index.jsp

PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL TICKETS ARE NON REFUNDABLE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATION
COSTS

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE - Oct 10: OWASP has arranged 
to
have a one-day hands on Web Application Security training course the day
prior to the conference. This one day class will be held at the nearby
Holiday Inn and is only $600 for conference attendees. Registration for 
this
course can be done via the conference registration page.

More details on this training course is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc/training.html

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - Oct 11: An optional dinner event is being held at

the
Holiday Inn Gaithersburg, which is the same location where the training 
is
to be held on the 10th, and where discounted rooms are being made 
available
to all conference attendees (see Accommodations below).

This event involves a dinner at the hotel from 7-9 PM, followed by 
drinks at
O'Malley's Irish Pub right in the hotel or out by the hotel's indoor 
pool
adjacent to the pub. We hope to see all of you there as this is a great
chance to mingle and meet many members of the OWASP community.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you all
there!

Thanks, Dave

Subject: [OWASP-Israel] ANN: WebGoat 3.7 - Application Security hands-on learning environment
Message-ID: <01FE74AA95A56946ADF84A4976618B9701C9176B@mammoth.utopiasystems.net>

The *only* way to learn application security is to test applications 
"hands on" and examine their source code. To encourage the next 
generation of application security experts, the Open Web Application 
Security Project (OWASP) has developed an extensive lesson-based 
training environment called "WebGoat".

WebGoat is a lessons based, deliberately insecure web application 
designed to teach web application security. Each of the 25 lessons 
provides the user an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding by 
exploiting a real vulnerability. WebGoat provides the ability to examine

the underlying code to gain a better understanding of the vulnerability 
as well as provide runtime hints to assist in solving each lesson. V3.7 
includes lessons covering most of the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities and 
contains several new lessons on web services, SQL Injection, and 
authentication.

WebGoat 3.7 is available for free download from:

    http://www.owasp.org/software/webgoat.html

Simply unzip, run, and go to WebGoat in your browser to start learning.

The OWASP Foundation is dedicated to finding and fighting the causes of 
insecure software. Find out more at http://www.owasp.org.

Subject: [OWASP-Israel] 2nd meeting of OWASP IL on September 21st!
Message-ID: <01FE74AA95A56946ADF84A4976618B9701D745C7@mammoth.utopiasystems.net>

 

Hi Everybody,

 

Time of the 2nd meeting of OWASP IL! The Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP) is an all-volunteer group that produces free,
professional-quality, open-source documentation, tools, and standards.
The OWASP community facilitates conferences, local chapters, articles,
papers, and message forums. It is most known for the OWASP guide and the
OWASP top 10, which are among the most important references regarding
applications security. 

 

The 2nd meeting of the Israeli OWASP chapter will be held on September
21st, 17:30, at Breach Security <http://www.breach.com/>  offices, 11th
Bareket St. Herzliya. Participation is free and open to all, but please
inform us (mail me at ofers at breach.com) that you are coming so that we
will be better prepared.

 

Feel free to distribute this e-mail to others in your organization or
outside that you think may be interested in the meeting. You can also
register to the OWASP Israel mailing list at
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-israel in order to
receive updates regarding chapter's meetings. For further details please
contact me.

 

The meeting agenda will be: 

17:30

Gathering, Socializing and Pizzas

17:50

Scripting with the Phishes - advanced Cross site scripting and phishing
attacks.
Ofer Maor, CTO hacktics <http://www.hacktics.com/>  

 

Cross site scripting (XSS) attacks are usually undervalued since the do
not affect the organization but rather its users. They are also
disregarded since many associate them with blogs, webmail services and
other socially oriented web applications and not with serious web sites.
New XSS attack techniques enable much deeper exploitation of XSS. One
such example is employing XSS to generate highly effective phishing
attacks. 

Ofer will discuss those new XSS techniques, demonstrate them and discuss
ways to protect from them.

18:35

HTTP Request Smuggling
Amit Klein, Officer, Web Application Security Consortium

 

Amit has published a research article regarding a new class of
application security vulnerabilities in HTTP called HTTP request
smuggling and would present the new technique in his lecture.

HTTP Request Smuggling works by taking advantage of the discrepancies in
parsing between devices which the HTTP request passes such as cache
servers, proxy servers, web application firewall and others. HTTP
Request Smuggling enables attacks such web cache poisoning, session
hijacking, cross-site scripting and most importantly and the ability to
bypass web application firewall protection.

19:15

Your feedback and Questions

 

See you all!

Subject: [OWASP-Israel] The IIS 48K request body feature (follow up to Noam's comment)
Message-ID: <43329954.23800.576DE1B@localhost>

Hi everybody

Thanks for attending yesterday's OWASP-IL meeting. If you remember, Noam Ben-Yochanan 
commented that IIS/5.x provides with the programmer with a way to consume the request body 
(beyond the 48K usually read), thus disabling the HTTP Request Smuggling caused by this 
anomaly. Today Noam sent me a link that clarifies this (and proves that he was rignt!):

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;810957

The short story is that IIS reads the body in buffers of 48K (the default value of 
UploadReadAheadSize in the MetaBase registry). It probably always reads the first buffer. 
Now, the HTTP Request Smuggling trick works by sending any Content-Type OTHER THAN 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. This means that IIS has nobody parsing the data and 
consuming more data, so it stops reading after those 48K, and whatever comes next is 
considered the next request (while MS says it is "by design", in my opinion this is still a 
bug, and with security implications).

As Noam noted, it is possible to "artificially" consume the data using Request.BinaryRead, 
e.g. something like:

  Dim data
  data = Request.BinaryRead(Request.TotalBytes) 

And by this, restore order.

So a possible solution is to insert the above code in every ASP page.

However, there is a serious downside to this method: if a page accesses Request.BinaryRead, 
it cannot access the Form collection (see the documentation of BinaryRead in 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/iissdk/html/c84b1f88-1a8a-
4370-95de-e907f7fdd5e7.asp).

Here's an improved solution. Note that the Content-Type of the request must be anything 
other than application/x-www-form-urlencoded for the attack to work (I understand now that 
this is due to the fact that in application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the IIS ASP.dll consumes 
the request body in fullness). So if a script wants to secure itself, it should check 
whether the Content-Type (accessible via ServerVariables("HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE") is 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
If it is, then the script can proceed as usual, and access the data through the Form 
collection. If the Content-Type is not "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", then the script 
should consume the data (as in the above example), and log the event (since this is 
probably an attack). Ideally, the script would terminate the TCP connection, but
I don't know whether a script can terminate the TCP connection in a reliable manner. 
Perhaps sending a "Connection: Close" header can do the trick (or a 400 status code?). 

So the proposed solution would be something like (pardon me for any ASP syntax error):

If (Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE")!="application/x-www-form-urlencoded") Then
	' Log a security error condition
	' Consume leftover data
	Dim data
	data = Request.BinaryRead(Request.TotalBytes) 
	' Exit gracefully - do not proceed to normal flow
EndIf

Still, it requires every ASP page to embed this kind of code. I think this makes the 
solution infeasible. Frankly I still call this a bug (be it by design or not) - an ASP page 
should not worry about its content-type or consuming the request body.

Thanks again to Noam!
-Amit
