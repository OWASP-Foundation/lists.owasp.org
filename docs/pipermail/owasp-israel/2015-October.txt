I am honored ? and very excited! ? to announce that the Keynote address at
the AppSec Israel Conference will be given by none other than Jeremiah
Grossman! 

 

Jeremiah Grossman, CTO and Founder of WhiteHat Security, possesses a unique
combination of technology savvy, customer advocacy and personal passion for
application security. A world-renowned web security expert, sought-after
speaker and influential blogger, Jeremiah brings a literal lifetime of
information security experience, both homegrown and from his days as
Yahoo!?s information security engineer. The ultimate ?WhiteHat,? Jeremiah is
also founder of the Web Application Security Consortium. In his spare time,
Jeremiah practices Brazilian Jiu jitsu and has earned a black belt.

 

He will likely speak about the history of AppSec, how much of it began right
here in Israel, and share a bit of stories around that and the past couple
of decades since. 

 

The Keynote will be in English, and more details will follow.

Hi Everybody! 

AppSec Israel 2015 conference is TOMORROW! Very exciting ? it looks like it
is going to be a fantastic event! 

 

We are needing some volunteers to help with on-site organization and
coordination (e.g. room proctors, doormen/women, etc.)

No climbing or heavy lifting involved, I promise. 

If you are able to help out ? please get in touch ASAP with Or Katz
(katz3112 at gmail.com <mailto:katz3112 at gmail.com> ) with your cellphone
number.

Volunteers will receive a free lunch, and free tickets to next year?s

The conference will take place TOMORROW, Tuesday, October 13th, 2015, at the
College of Management (Michlala LeMinhal) in Rishon LeZiyon, starting from
9:00.

Opening words will start at 9:30, and the Keynote immediately after. 

The address is Eli Weisel St. 2, Rishon LeZiyon. There is plenty of parking
available, entrance is via gate 4. 

(Please note that parking should be paid during the day, to avoid a lengthy
backup if everyone pays on exit. The cost of parking is ~10 shekel for the
entire day). 

 

We had to close the registration, as we are expecting over 500 people to
attend!

We ask everyone to please try to get there as early as possible, to avoid a
backlog at the registration desks, and to ensure you have a spot in the main
auditorium. 

(Safety codes prevent us from allowing more than the maximum number of
people to get in to the rooms). 

If you?ve already registered, we?ll see you tomorrow ? make sure to come say
hi! 

If you haven?t registered ? what were you thinking?? 

 

We are looking forward to two tracks of fantastic talks by an amazing group
of speakers, see below for details. (Please note, there have been some
changes to the schedule). 

And one more thing? The Keynote address will be given by Jeremiah Grossman,
Founder of WhiteHat Security, and one of the original innovators of the
appsec field! 

 

More details are at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2015, and

We NEED your feedback on the conference, and it wont take more than a few

Did you already send your feedbacks? If not, we'll wait, go ahead.
http://goo.gl/forms/7QfFrnSi5u 

 

Only a few of the presentations are online yet, but we are collecting the
rest of them and will upload them as soon as we can. 

They will be available at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2015_Presentations within a

Videos of most of the talks were also recorded, and these will also be
uploaded and available online shortly. 

Many thanks to our video sponsor, Checkmarx! 

 

If you have any pictures, videos, etc of the conference - please send me a

Some numbers about the Conference: 

-         Over 550 attended (out of 730 registered) - our biggest ever! 

-         17 Sponsors - 1 Platinum, 7 Gold, 5 Silver, and 4 Community

-         16 Speakers 

-         3 coffee breaks and one lunch :) 

 

As was mentioned several times - we love feedback! We really want to hear
your perspective and experience, so that we can plan next year's conference
to be even more awesome. 

If you attended the conference, please take a few minutes RIGHT NOW to fill
in this online form (if you haven't already): http://goo.gl/forms/7QfFrnSi5u


 

Your feedback on the conference is VERY important to us, to help us decide
which sessions to select for next year's conference. Please do give us as
much information as you can. 

(And no need to try to brute-force the form either, that is no challenge. So
please don't. ) 

 

Our thanks go out to: 

-         A special thanks to Dr. Yehuda Elmaliach and the College of
Management and staff, who graciously offered to host us this year. 

-         Thank you to all the sponsors that enabled us to make the most out
of the conference, without worrying about hunger, thirst, or caffeine
deficiency. 

-         Thanks to all the speakers, who made it all worthwhile - and, in
the words of several attendees, "even better than the international
conferences like BlackHat and RSAC" :)

-         A special thanks to our keynote speaker, Jeremiah Grossman, for
travelling all the way over to join us and share his vision with the crowd! 

-         Thanks also to all those who submitted a proposal for a talk - and
there were so many excellent proposals! Though we were unfortunately not
able to fit in all the talks this year, I hope we can entice you all to join
us at one of the next chapter meetings. I hope you all continue to
contribute, and that we'll be able to hear you next time! 

-         Thanks to all the volunteers who helped facilitate flow and timing
- Eitan Caspi, Ilya Chernyakov, Iris Levari, Elad Kirson, Boris
Chernilovsky, Moshe Zioni, Eliraz Broyer, Ofir Inbar, Anton Khitrenovich,
and anyone else I may have forgotten! 

-         And thanks to all the rest of the team and staff that helped
organize the event - Shiran Cohen, Ety Amram, Or Katz, Ofer Maor, Erez
Metula, and Hemed Gur Ary!  

 

See you all next year! 

 

Avi D 

Chairman, OWASP Israel
