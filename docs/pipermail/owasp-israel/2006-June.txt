Hi all,

 

We at breach have several development positions open. While prior experience in application security is not required, it can certainly be a big plus!

 

1. Software developers

3-5 years development experience in C++, Linux/Unix

Knowledge in complex and multi-threading environments

Networking, security and HTTP knowledge is a plus

Work as independent and as part of a team

Excellent human relations

 

2. QA Student

2nd year student in Computer Science / software engineering

Linux knowledge is a plus

Be able to work at least 20 hours a week

Excellent human relations

 

3. Configuration Management (Software practical engineer or a student)

Excellent human relations 

We need someone who has basic knowledge in programming ? C/C++.

Advantage of knowing UNIX scripts and Perl

Advantage (not mandatory): CM experience.

Education: best is Practical Engineer, but also transferred engineers (??????) or no experience engineers.

 

See you working at Breach!
