Message-ID: <BAY402-EAS8523059581995C473A04CBB1480@phx.gbl>

The OWASP Israel Conference will take place this year on 1/10/2013. 

 

In order to ensure fascinating lectures as every year, we are opening a Call
for Papers and inviting you to send proposals for lectures. 

 

In order to ensure that we can give serious consideration to the content of
the lecture, please send proposals in the following format: 

 

*         Please send all proposals to me ? douglen at hotmail.com
<mailto:douglen at hotmail.com>  

*         The subject of the email should be: OWASP Israel CFP ? [Title]
(where Title is the actual title of the talk)

*         The email should come from the Speaker him/herself (do not submit
proposals in others? name). 

*         The email should include: 

o   Lecture title ? in Hebrew and in English

o   Abstract (at least a paragraph, no more than half a page) 

o   Short biography of the speaker

o   Technical level of the talk (introduction / intermediate / advanced)

o   If the talk will be delivered in any language other than Hebrew ? please
specify this explicitly! 

*         Proposals should be submitted no later than 13/9/2013 (Erev Yom
Kippur). We will not be able to consider any proposals that arrive later. 

 

In general, there is no restriction on the subject of the talks, as long as
the topic is related to Application Security (not necessarily Web). We will
not accept any talks regarding other aspects of Security, that are not
applicative in nature. Talks at any technical level can be accepted ? we are
planning two tracks, one more technical than the other. 

 

We would especially appreciate talks from security folk in large
organizations who can share different Case Studies from the field. 

 

I would like to emphasize that we usually receive more proposals than the
number of slots we have for lectures at the conference. We apologize in
advance that we cannot include all worthy proposals.
