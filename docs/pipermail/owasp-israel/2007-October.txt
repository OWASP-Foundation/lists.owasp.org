Subject: [OWASP IL] Call for presenters and sponsors for OWASP Israel
	conference 2007, Dec 3rd 2007
Message-ID: <50E6558DF2E9624DA8DADDE0C5018486B66685@midas.utopiasystems.net>


Just before wrapping up 2007, we will be holding OWASP IL 3rd conference
on Monday, December 3rd. Continuing our successful relationship with the
information security program at the Efi Arazi Computer Science school of
the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya, we will hold the conference
there. 

As usual, we will strive to make it one of the most professional
security events in Israel, and as always the best for professional
networking. So mark Monday, Dec 3rd starting around noon on you on your
calendar.

If you would like to present at the conference, please contact me at
ofers at breach.com, or call me at +972-54-4431119 to discuss you
presentation.

We are also looking for sponsors who are interested in sponsoring the
event. Sponsorship is targeted solely to cover event costs and not for
any commercial gain (and is therefore pretty cheap). Sponsors get, among
other things, a booth in the event's lobby, and have their logo on the
conference page on the OWASP site.
