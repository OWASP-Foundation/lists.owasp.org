Hi all,

AppSecEU 2014 is approaching quickly and we have lots of great speakers and
exciting presentations and trainings for you.
Your opportunity to discuss with the best in our field, hear the latest
security tech presentations and learn and have a lot of fun.

This year AppSecEU will be in Cambridge, just a short 1-hour train ride
from London.
We got a great venue at Anglia Ruskin University?s Cambridge campus and
will on June-25 have a stylish conference dinner in the Victorian Gothic
style Great Hall at Homerton College. An evening event not to miss. :-)

*AppSecEU** 2014*
*Date: June 23-26*



*Venue: Cambridge, Anglia Ruskin University Program: Conference
(June-25/26)*
The main conference will be on June 25th and 26th with lots of amazing
keynote speakers flying in, and tech talks about the latest on mobile
security, hacking web applications and how to defend them, to management
topics like lots of best practices and stuff that works. And while there,
you'll have the opportunity to meet and discuss with your peers and
industry experts and also visit tables from our sponsors in the hallway,
who will show their latest tools and products at the exhibition hall.
*T**r**ainings (June-23/24)*
Before that on June-23th and 24th we have 1- and 2-day training classes and
bootcamps where you can dive deep into the technical problems and learn
from the leading experts in the field (and see how deep the rabbit hole
goes). The classes will be about mobile app security, injection flaws,
WebHacking, defensive programming and writing secure code, up to management
trainings about openSAMM and a CISO training about managing application
security for senior managers.

Here the link to the conference page:
https://2014.appsec.eu

And for your registration:
https://2014.appsec.eu/registering-for-the-conference/

(For your convenience, we also secured a block of very affordable rooms
close to the venue - but better book quickly as they go fast.)

Please spread the word among your colleagues and friends and looking
forward to seeing you all end of June in Cambridge!

Cheers, Tobias

Rise of the Machines

Shlomo Yona, Applied Researcher and Innovation Group Leader, F5 Networks

 

Why we need machines to handle machine generated intel and how to do it. 

We will discuss a severe and growing problem of IT/Ops/Security
professionals and exemplify concretely with a description of how we
reproduced results reported in ?An Empirical Study Of Passive 802.11 Device
Fingerprinting? (http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6457) with some modifications and
use the opportunity to see how Automated Statistical Inference can be
utilized to identify spoofed MAC addresses.

 

-          18:20 ? 19:00

Security Testing & The Depth Behind OWASP Top 10

Yaniv Simsolo, Senior Security Expert

 

OWASP changed the Top 10 List in 2013. Some new security areas are
incorporated into the updated Top 10 list. In the past few years modern
systems? architecture and coding practices have also changed, evolved and
transformed exponentially. Relying on proven security concepts is not
sufficient anymore and therefore other approaches are required.

We will venture into the depth of the more obscure security areas now
included in the Top 10, and the reality of the security of modern systems.
The pitfalls of security tests will be reviewed and an alternative approach
for modern systems security testing will be discussed in length.

 

-          19:00 ? 19:20

Coffee break

 

-          19:20 ? 20:00 

DDoS Attacks: Peeling The Onion On One Of The Most Sophisticated Ever Seen

Eldad Chai, VP Products, Incapsula

 

Taking down a competitor's website can be very valuable. Unlike Hacktivists,
with generally short attention spans, or regular cybercriminals, who usually
give up when faced with adequate protection, these well-funded attacks
persist over time, and employ multiple, sophisticated vectors. This session
will review a real case study defending against one of the largest, most
sophisticated and persistent DDoS attacks. These include: Networking
Capacity, Client Classification, Whitelisting/Blacklisting/Crowdsourcing,
Challenge mechanisms, Anomaly detection and the secret sauce...

 

 

Hope to see you all there! (And don?t forget to register?)

Hi again,

I'm re sending this message for two reasons:
a. The links were somehow gone
b. Too many people wanted to know more and I don't want to lose any
volunteer because of a misunderstanding.

Here's the original message with the links:

Please send a short email if you want to join the project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More about the project:

The CISO Survey is a global OWASP project in it's second year. The
project's aim is to provide insight into CISO needs and concerns both to
OWASP and the CISO themselves. Avi and me have decided it would a good
project to invest in locally. Adding the local data to the global one would
would benefit us in understanding our national standpoint and what
differentiates Israel from the world. The project can also provide more
exposure to our organization.

The main task we have for volunteers at the moment is translation.


Thanks,

Hemed
