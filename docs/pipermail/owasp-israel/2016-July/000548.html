<PRE>Hi, 

The OWASP Foundation is undergoing a rather big project, to reorganize the main website / wiki. Since many people use the website, in many different ways with different requirements, the organization is trying to collect as much information as possible. 

 

Everyone is invited to join this chat and share your perspective.

Subject: [Owasp-community] OWASP Talk Back/Town Hall Re: Website Changes

 

Hello Everyone, 

 

We now have the results of the Needs Assessment done by Sooryen (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/images/b/b2/OWASP_Needs_Assessment_Report.pdf">https://www.owasp.org/images/b/b2/OWASP_Needs_Assessment_Report.pdf</A>). 

 

 The main takeaways of the report were:

*  Clean up our navigation and content strategy to increase usability and search capability.

*  Create a cleaner front page and select landing pages (such as the main Projects Page) so that people coming to our site can clearly figure out their next steps.

*  Improve the wiki aspect of our site so that it is easier to use.

*  Better integrate back end systems and communication.

*  Create a distinction between business/organization information and App Sec information.

Now we need your opinions on the matter.  To that end we will be hosting a Twitter and FB chat on July 25th where you can discuss your thoughts with Ram Ganesan, Gin Cheng from Sooryen as well as myself. Please share this information with your Chapters, Projects, Leaders, and fellow Members.  It is vital that we have as much participation as possible in this discussion. 

 

The Facebook chat will be hosted from 2 am PDT/9 am GMT to 8 am PDT/3 pm GMT on our FB Page &lt;<A HREF="https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/ffe97632-8093-43fd-874e-367d6297da7e/facebook-com-open-web-application-security-project-296236753839074">https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/ffe97632-8093-43fd-874e-367d6297da7e/facebook-com-open-web-application-security-project-296236753839074</A>&gt;  

 

The Twitter chat will be hosted form 8 am PDT/3 pm GMT to 9 am PDT/4 pm GMT.  The hashtag will be #OWASPChat

 

The Questions covered are:

1.     For the top level navigation, what do you think are the most relevant categories that should be included? 

2.     What are your thoughts on segregating the business and security information? 

3.     What are your thoughts on moving off of the MediaWiki platform? 

4.     What search engine would you recommend (elasticsearch)?

5.     What are your thoughts on the redesigns?

6.     What communications platforms or methods do you think we should adopt to better communicate with the community?

7.     Do you feel positive about moving forward with the site make over and improvements?
