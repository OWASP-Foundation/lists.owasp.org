<PRE>As you all know, the AppSecIL conference is free to attend. 

However, that is not to say there are no costs involved. Every year, the
costs of the conference are covered by our fantastic sponsors. 

This year, we are still in need of additional sponsors to cover expenses.  

 

And it will be a great conference! We have a fantastic set of talks,
hundreds of people have already registered - we are expecting over 400
people to attend this year! (If you haven't signed up yet - you can do so
here <A HREF="https://appsecil2014.eventbrite.com/">https://appsecil2014.eventbrite.com/</A> )

 

If you or your company is in a position to support the application security
community in Israel, PLEASE CONSIDER SPONSORING! 

There are several levels of sponsorship opportunities, with varying prices. 

 

Even if a full sponsorship is not an option (for whatever reason), I would
urge you to consider being a &quot;Community Supporter&quot; - this is not very
expensive and it would go a long way to help us put on a great conference. 

 

See all the details regarding sponsorships and benefits here:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship</A> 

 

Please contact Ory Segal (CC'd) or myself ASAP if you can help us! We need
to finalize the arrangements by tomorrow, so we need every possible sponsor
to step up today. 

 

Thank you for your continuing support!

Subject: [OWASP Israel] OWASP AppSec IL 2014 Conference - 2nd. Call For
Sponsors

 

Hi Everyone,

 

The conference is still in need of additional sponsors in order to cover the
expenses of this year's event. You can find more details about the
sponsorship plans here:
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship</A>&gt;
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship</A>

 

** Attention Non-profits, Government offices, and small Start-ups: **

For the first time, we have an entry-level sponsorship plan called
&quot;Community Supporter&quot; (
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship#Community_Supporters">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship#Community_Supporters</A>&gt;
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship#Community_Supporters">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship#Community_Supporters</A> )
- the price is only $500 USD. 

 

This entry level sponsorship enables you to:

*	Show your appreciation to OWASP Israel and this event in particular
(especially if you send numerous employees to the conference)
*	You will be able to leave a stack of flyers or swag at a central
table
*	Have your logo appear on the conference page

This level does not entitle you to a booth/table of your own - but it's
still a great way to be a part of this event!

 

Thank you for your support,

-Ory

Subject: OWASP AppSec IL 2014 Conference - Call For Sponsors

 

Hello Everyone,

 

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will take place this year on
Tuesday, September 2, 2014. The conference will take place at the IDC in
Herzliya, as in previous years.  

 

OWASP Israel encourages companies to sponsor the conferences and help pay
for expenses such as refreshments, photography, video etc. The conferences
are not commercial and the cost goes directly to cover expenses. Since our
conferences draw an increasingly large number of attendees, conference
expenses also rise accordingly.

 

If you or your company benefit from OWASP materials and/or conferences, we
encourage you to support us! Moreover, the associated publicity and
community goodwill can go a long way. We have several levels of sponsorships
available, appropriate for the different organizations that wish to support
OWASP Israel activities. Of course, if you are an OWASP Corporate Member (at
any level) and allocate a percentage (20-40%) of your membership fees to the
Israeli chapter, we can consider those funds as conference sponsorship. It
is also possible to be creative and find non-financial ways to support us
and contribute to the successful running of the conference.

 

You can find more information about conference sponsorship in the following
page:

 &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship</A>&gt;
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship</A>  

 

If you have any questions, or would like your organization to sponsor the
event, please contact Ory Segal:  &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">orysegal at gmail.com</A>&gt;
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">orysegal at gmail.com</A>

 

We truly appreciate your help!

OWASP Israel
