Subject: [OWASP IL] OWASP IL 2008 Turbo Talk (a.k.a. Rump) Session
Message-ID: <38e2d2a70807220646r1ff7ebc4v4d6df636493fef71@mail.gmail.com>

Shalom All,

This year OWASP IL will include for the first time a Turbo Talk session
(a.k.a. rump session), inspired by the CRYPTO conference rump
sessions<http://www.iacr.org/conferences/crypto2007/rump.html>and by
the O'Reilly
IGNITE sessions <http://ignite.oreilly.com/>. Quoting from the CRYPTO 2007
rump session CFP <http://www.iacr.org/conferences/crypto2007/rump.html>:
*"This is intended to be an informal session in which participants give
short and entertaining presentations on recent results, work in progress,
and other topics of interest to the community. Presentations that are not
purely technical in nature are also possible ? and encouraged!"*Let's see
you give a talk in *5 minutes*!  From experience, this is a dynamic and
interesting event which is a lot of fun both for presenters and for
attendees.

For more information, go ahead and visit the CFP at:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2008_Conference_Turbo_Talks

Hope to see you there,
Yossi.
