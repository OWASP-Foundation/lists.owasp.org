Rise of the Machines

Shlomo Yona, Applied Researcher and Innovation Group Leader, F5 Networks

 

Why we need machines to handle machine generated intel and how to do it. 

We will discuss a severe and growing problem of IT/Ops/Security
professionals and exemplify concretely with a description of how we
reproduced results reported in ?An Empirical Study Of Passive 802.11 Device
Fingerprinting? (http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6457) with some modifications and
use the opportunity to see how Automated Statistical Inference can be
utilized to identify spoofed MAC addresses.

Security Testing & The Depth Behind OWASP Top 10

Yaniv Simsolo, Senior Consultant, Comsec Consulting

 

OWASP changed the Top 10 List in 2013. Some new security areas are
incorporated into the updated Top 10 list. In the past few years modern
systems? architecture and coding practices have also changed, evolved and
transformed exponentially. Relying on proven security concepts is not
sufficient anymore and therefore other approaches are required.

We will venture into the depth of the more obscure security areas now
included in the Top 10, and the reality of the security of modern systems.
The pitfalls of security tests will be reviewed and an alternative approach
for modern systems security testing will be discussed in length.

 

-          19:00 ? 19:20

Coffee break

 

-          19:20 ? 20:00 

DDoS Attacks: Peeling The Onion On One Of The Most Sophisticated Ever Seen

Eldad Chai, VP Products, Incapsula

 

Taking down a competitor's website can be very valuable. Unlike Hacktivists,
with generally short attention spans, or regular cybercriminals, who usually
give up when faced with adequate protection, these well-funded attacks

Message-ID: <SNT404-EAS488A6731F8EE429F32A5F9B1240@phx.gbl>

I re-opened the registration, it seems that the available seats were snapped
up pretty quickly. 

If you were blocked from registering before, you can now try again. 

 

PLEASE NOTE: We do have some strict space restrictions, and need to plan
accordingly. 

If you are not planning on coming (or haven?t decided yet), please do not
register needlessly. 

Likewise, if you have registered but will not come (or are registered
twice), please cancel your registration accordingly, to allow the space to
go to someone else. 

 

Thanks,

Avi D

Rise of the Machines

Shlomo Yona, Applied Researcher and Innovation Group Leader, F5 Networks

 

Why we need machines to handle machine generated intel and how to do it. 

We will discuss a severe and growing problem of IT/Ops/Security
professionals and exemplify concretely with a description of how we
reproduced results reported in ?An Empirical Study Of Passive 802.11 Device
Fingerprinting? (http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6457) with some modifications and
use the opportunity to see how Automated Statistical Inference can be
utilized to identify spoofed MAC addresses.

 

-          18:20 ? 19:00

Security Testing & The Depth Behind OWASP Top 10

Yaniv Simsolo, Senior Consultant, Comsec Consulting

 

OWASP changed the Top 10 List in 2013. Some new security areas are
incorporated into the updated Top 10 list. In the past few years modern
systems? architecture and coding practices have also changed, evolved and
transformed exponentially. Relying on proven security concepts is not
sufficient anymore and therefore other approaches are required.

We will venture into the depth of the more obscure security areas now
included in the Top 10, and the reality of the security of modern systems.
The pitfalls of security tests will be reviewed and an alternative approach
for modern systems security testing will be discussed in length.

 

-          19:00 ? 19:20

Coffee break

 

-          19:20 ? 20:00 

DDoS Attacks: Peeling The Onion On One Of The Most Sophisticated Ever Seen

Eldad Chai, VP Products, Incapsula

 

Taking down a competitor's website can be very valuable. Unlike Hacktivists,
with generally short attention spans, or regular cybercriminals, who usually
give up when faced with adequate protection, these well-funded attacks
persist over time, and employ multiple, sophisticated vectors. This session
will review a real case study defending against one of the largest, most
sophisticated and persistent DDoS attacks. These include: Networking
Capacity, Client Classification, Whitelisting/Blacklisting/Crowdsourcing,
Challenge mechanisms, Anomaly detection and the secret sauce...

 

 

Hope to see you all there! (And don?t forget to register?)
