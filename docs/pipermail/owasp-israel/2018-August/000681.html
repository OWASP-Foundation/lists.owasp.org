<PRE>Hi all! 

 

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference  will take place this year on
Thursday, September 6th, 2018. Our Training Day will be the day before, on
Wednesday, September 5th. This year we are partnering with Tel Aviv
University, to host the conference in the University facility.

 

We need your help! 

AppSec Israel is a free conference, and yet still provides some of the best
content anywhere. But hosting such a large event, with a comfortable venue,
free food and coffee all day long, and other activities - all this costs a
lot of money. 

If your company chooses to support this amazing community, you will get a
wonderful opportunity to show off your company, product, or service to a
fabulous collection of incredibly talented people - whether you are looking
to sell or recruit, this is the right audience for you! 

Sponsorships are very reasonably priced with a variety of options, please
see details here:
<A HREF="https://2018.appsecil.org/assets/AppSecIL_2018_Sponsorships.pdf">https://2018.appsecil.org/assets/AppSecIL_2018_Sponsorships.pdf</A> 

We are getting close to the Conference, and still need more support! Please
contact me (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">avi.douglen at owasp.org</A> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">avi.douglen at owasp.org</A>&gt; ) by next
week to get in on time! 

 

 

As you all know, OWASP's AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. We
are expecting 700-800 people to attend the conference, and hundreds more for
the training. The Conference will include multiple lecture tracks, TWO
marvelous keynotes, workshops, Capture the Flag competition, and a sponsors
display area for vendors of products and services relevant to Application
Security. We will also have a special Women in AppSec (WIA) event on
Wednesday evening. 

 

Don't miss it this year! All events are free to attend, but you must
register in advance: <A HREF="https://2018.appsecil.org/Register">https://2018.appsecil.org/Register</A>

enabling us to improve the conference, while still keeping it free for
everybody!
