<PRE>Hi All,
The countdown had began, we are less than a week from AppSec Israel 2018!
We are close to our registration limits so I encourage you (if you haven't
done that yet) to register to training/WIA/conference days in -
<A HREF="https://2018.appsecil.org/Register">https://2018.appsecil.org/Register</A>

If you want to help us with conference and training organization please
reach out Hemed Gur-Ary at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">hemed.gur.ary at owasp.org</A>

We are also planning to have some outstanding activities during the
conference days such as:

   - Capture the Flag activity - lead by Tomer Zait (F5 networks) and
   Nimrod Levy (Scorpiones), registration for teams and individuals is open at
   <A HREF="https://owaspil.ctf.today/">https://owaspil.ctf.today/</A> and the contest will start few days before
   the conference!!
   - Resume Review / CV Critique workshop - lead by Guy Barnhart-Magen, So
   many talented young professionals in the AppSec field (and some not so
   young) miss out on great opportunities in which they would excel, and bring
   amazing value to their employers. Often, this happens because of a
   lackluster resume or CV, which does not properly showcase their talent and
   abilities. We are recruiting experienced managers, interviewers, and HR
   professionals to help you improve your resume (reach out Guy at
   <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">barnhart.guy at gmail.com</A>), and offer tips to better show off what you can
   do - and get you in the door at the right employer! Remember to bring your
   resume or CV with you! (Preferably paper printout, as that is easier to
   review).


We are looking forward to seeing you on training day next Wednesday and
conference day next Thursday.

Thanks,

*Or Katz*
*OWASP Israel Chair*
