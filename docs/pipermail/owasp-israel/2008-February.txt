Subject: [OWASP IL] Web Hacking Incidenets Database 2007 annual Report is out
Message-ID: <00e001c86a14$29e569d0$7db03d70$@com>


The Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID) annual report for 2007 is out.

The WHID 2007 annual report builds on the new metrics we recently added to
WHID, such as attack method, attack outcome, country and industry sector of
hacked organization to analyze web hacking trends in 2007.

In the report we discuss the drivers for web hacking, the vulnerabilities
exploited and the types of organization attacked. We hope that the report
can serve to highlight the web application security issue and as a base for
risk analysis for web applications.

The report was prepared by The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC)
together with Breach Security Labs, the research arm of Breach Security,
which sponsors the project. 

The report is available at:
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/statistics.shtml

Subject: [OWASP IL] Web Hacking Incidents Database Update for Feb 20th
Message-ID: <006101c873bb$08595550$190bfff0$@com>

The latest bunch of events added to the Web Hacking Incidents Database
include many international incidents. Enjoy. And if you still haven't had a
chance to read our 2007 annual report, it is quite fascinating. you can find
it at http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/statistics.shtml.

* In Korea, a Chinese hacker stole 18 Million(!) customers' records from an
auction site: http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-10.shtml. 

* In Greece and Ecuador government web sites where defaced
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-12.shtml,
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-11.shtml). 

* In the US a small financial firm in Montana lost the information of all
its 226,000 customers
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-08.shtml)

But the incident I want to focus on this week is one I just added from late
last year: In India a large newspaper site was broken into and malware was
planted on it
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2007-85.shtml). Why is it
important? based on a recent report by WebSense, 51% of the sites hosing
malware are legitimate sites that have been broken into. This is a major
shift in web based threats. For end users, it is not sufficient anymore to
keep to web sites they trust. For site owners it means that protecting their
sensitive applications is no longer sufficient. Hackers have a financial
incentive to attack any popular page. The direct damage of such an attack,
even though invisible, is less visitors as more and more browser add-ons
block access to sites hosting malware. The indirect damage is of course a
branding and marketing damage.

Message-ID: <346038b60802210140w435b02denece54c141aa94472@mail.gmail.com>

I am a customer of Discount Bank, and use their internet self service.
Occasionally I have to change my password, and the new password is checked
for compliance with their password policy.
Guess what the password policy is? Exactly 6 (six) characters. I can't use 4
or five, which makes sense.
But I can't use 7, 8, or more characters even if I want to. Now, that
doesn't make sense...

Still, the locked account countermeasure and the password policy
countermeasure should be unrelated.
I agree that as a total solution you will be locked down, so that the
user is (supposed to be) safe, but still they narrowed down the total
number of possible passwords and by that weakened the security of the
total solution.

Correct me if I'm wrong, a few unsuccessful login attempts will lock the

account.
That will extremely narrow the chance for a successful BF attack.

BTW, the "locked down" solution can be easily used by an attacked to DOS
a specific user... 
Let's say that the victim is supposed to perform some operation in the
site, and the attacker knows about it. All he has to do is intentionally
fail to authenticate (just before the victim) under the victim's account
the number of times it needs to block him from the login.

Username is secret...? Obscurity at its finest form.

And, as you said, there's sometimes a pattern in it. And even if not it is very easy to get it.

That's why you're supposed to keep both your username and password secret, and they're both supposed to be hard-to-calculate from user-details (supposedly random).

though most banks have some structure at lest in the username, which could be used to DOS the entire bank client?le.

Subject: [OWASP IL] Password policy of Discount Bank's internet services

 

I am a customer of Discount Bank, and use their internet self service.
Occasionally I have to change my password, and the new password is checked for compliance with their password policy.
Guess what the password policy is? Exactly 6 (six) characters. I can't use 4 or five, which makes sense. 
But I can't use 7, 8, or more characters even if I want to. Now, that doesn't make sense...

That's why you're supposed to keep both your username and password secret,
and they're both supposed to be hard-to-calculate from user-details
(supposedly random).

though most banks have some structure at lest in the username, which could
be used to DOS the entire bank client?le.

The question is if limiting the number of possible passwords to 6 characters instead of the option to use any number of characters (6 or more in this case) is a security problem.

IMHO, if you implement a good mechanism to lock the user after 3-5 bad login attempts and set policy to choose a new password every time a user locks down you'll see that brute force is not a real security issue in this case.

After all - 6 characters give ~60^6 password options (why 60? All the lower and upper case, add 1-0 and you'll get 62 and I didn't mentioned the special characters)  and with a 5 bad login attempts lock - It is impossible to brute force.

  Still, the locked account countermeasure and the password policy
  countermeasure should be unrelated.
  I agree that as a total solution you will be locked down, so that the

In this specific case (Discount bank), the username is in the form of an
Israeli I.D. number.
I.D. number can be easily deduced from details such as the name and address
of the victim using "population registration" databases (such as
"Reshumon", etc.).
Therefore, as Erez suggested, a targeted attack against a victim should be
rather simple.

Guy, 

To start with, the password space is a bit smaller - passwords are not case sensitive and special chars are not allowed.

IMHO you don't adress the real problem.

MY BANK HAS A ROTTEN PASSWORD POLICY!!! 

When you issue a corporate password policy, your user will tell you that you don't make sense: even the bank does not insist on more than 6 characters! And why use special characters? Why use mixed case?  If a simple password is good for the bank, surely it is good enough for me, no?

It makes you wonder what else they may have missed in their security procedures.

  The question is if limiting the number of possible passwords to 6 characters instead of the option to use any number of characters (6 or more in this case) is a security problem.

  IMHO, if you implement a good mechanism to lock the user after 3-5 bad login attempts and set policy to choose a new password every time a user locks down you'll see that brute force is not a real security issue in this case.

  After all - 6 characters give ~60^6 password options (why 60? All the lower and upper case, add 1-0 and you'll get 62 and I didn't mentioned the special characters)  and with a 5 bad login attempts lock - It is impossible to brute force.

    Username is secret.? Obscurity at its finest form.

    And, as you said, there's sometimes a pattern in it. And even if not it is very easy to get it.

    That's why you're supposed to keep both your username and password secret, and they're both supposed to be hard-to-calculate from user-details (supposedly random).

    though most banks have some structure at lest in the username, which could be used to DOS the entire bank client?le.

    Still, the locked account countermeasure and the password policy
    countermeasure should be unrelated.
    I agree that as a total solution you will be locked down, so that the
    user is (supposed to be) safe, but still they narrowed down the total
    number of possible passwords and by that weakened the security of the
    total solution.

    Correct me if I'm wrong, a few unsuccessful login attempts will lock the

    account.
    That will extremely narrow the chance for a successful BF attack.

I agree it is far from being a good password mechanism, but one thing should be cleared: Discount Bank passwords need to be _at least_ 6 characters long and not "exactly" 6 characters long.

Check out http://www.discountbank.co.il/cgi-bin/inetcgi/discount/front/main_item.jsp?catID=-536887533

In addition I can tell you for a fact that passwords longer than 6 characters work, and giving only the first 6 characters doesn't work.

 

OTOH, the fact that they do an automatic to_lower or sth similar (apparently it is a true fact, albeit not listed anywhere on their site) is indeed outrageous.

 

I'm leaving the discussion about the strength of passwords to Schneier and the rest of you ;-)

Julius Cesar said, when Poska, his adviser, urged him to double the guards: "Guards can protect me from my enemies; they can't protect me from my allies. After few weeks he had been murdered by his ally, Brutus, in the senate.

 

In my bank, unlock the account is only by phone, quiet nasty procedure. Support center is not 24/7. 

 

The DOS attack is possible & the possible is the inevitable ... (assuming the attacker knows the username ... an 'ally'),

 

and even "6 char password + 3 wrong guesses lock"  is strong enough to eliminate an effective BF attack.

 

Sincerely,

Amit Gefen
