<PRE>This year, in addition to the exciting AppSec Israel conference, we are adding a full day of training. 

 

The Training Day will take place on Tuesday, October 17th, 2017 &#8211; right before the AppSecIL Conference, and in the same location: The College of Management (Michlala l&#8217;Minhal), in Rishon LeZion. 

 

This AppSecIL Training is part of the OWASP World Tour (OWT) &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_World_Tour">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_World_Tour</A>&gt; , who will be providing  professional security trainer, and is aimed at developers and newcomers to appsec. The purpose of this OWT Training is to improve the security of all software, and to grow the pool of skilled professionals in the field. 

 

Attending the Training is free, of course. 

We are limiting it to 500 attendees however, and registration will be required (we will open registration in early September). 

 

We are now calling for trainers to submit their proposals to deliver this training, for which they will be paid appropriately. 

The Training will be a full day event, lasting 6 to 8 hours, and should provide an overview of core application security topics, as applies to software development. 

 

Topics may include, but not limited to:

*	General Security Principles as they relate to Application Security
*	Application Security specific topics
*	Preventing attacks and mitigation
*	Security mechanisms
*	Secure code

*	Consideration will be given to how OWASP projects can assist in the topics covered 

 

Please submit your bid (including your requested fee) here: <A HREF="https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/91874/owasp-global-training-tour-tel-aviv-israel-rishon-10-17-2017">https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/91874/owasp-global-training-tour-tel-aviv-israel-rishon-10-17-2017</A> 

 

The CFT and OWT teams will select the training based on content, quality of submission, and expertise of trainer(s), and are completely independent of any vendor or sponsor support. 

 

Please also forward this email to relevant people or companies who might be interested in delivering this high-impact training. 

 

Thanks,

Avi D 

OWASP Israel Chairman
