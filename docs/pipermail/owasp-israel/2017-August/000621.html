<PRE>With the biggest AppSec event in the country just two months away, we are
calling on you for your support: we still need additional sponsors!  

Several sponsors have already committed, however we do need more.  

 

Sponsorship funds go directly to covering the costs of the conference,
including food, coffee, badges, and other logistics. We rely on our
sponsors' support, in order to keep the conference free. 

 

ONLY 10 DAYS LEFT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EARLY BIRD DISCOUNT! 

10% off all premium sponsorship tiers, until September 1. 

For more details please see
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/images/5/50/AppSec_Israel_2017_Sponsorships.pdf">https://www.owasp.org/images/5/50/AppSec_Israel_2017_Sponsorships.pdf</A>

 

And while we look forward to you supporting the community, it is also a
fantastic opportunity for marketing to the many organizations that attend
the conference, or are part of our community. It is also an excellent
opportunity for recruiting, from amongst the hundreds of qualified
professionals! 

 

Please be in touch with Or Katz (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">katz3112 at gmail.com</A>
&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">katz3112 at gmail.com</A>&gt; ) for more details, or to reserve your spot
today. 

 

Thank you!

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference is the largest conference in
Israel for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of
participants. Over 650 people attended last year! 

 

Whether you have a product to showcase, offering a service, or you are
recruiting, sponsoring the OWASP AppSec Israel event gets you the right
exposure. This year we are expecting well over 700 attendees, including
security professionals, developers, managers, and more. 

 

The conference will take place this year on Wednesday, October 18th, 2017,
at The College of Management (Michlala l'Minhal), in Rishon LeZion - just
south of Tel Aviv. In addition, we will be hosting a free Training Day, part
of the OWASP World Tour, on October 17th, 2017. This will provide developers
with the basic skills they need to build secure systems. 

 

Sponsoring the AppSecIL Conference also helps support the OWASP community,
and ensures that we can keep on making our conferences better and better.
Sponsorship fees are intended to cover the costs of the Conference. Since
the Conference is open to all and free of charge to attend, we need your
support to enable us to put on a great conference. 

 

Past sponsors include Intuit, SafeBreach, GE Digital, Akamai, Imperva,
Checkmarx, Synopsys, Ben Gurion University, LivePerson, and many others. 

 

OWASP is an open source, non-profit organization. While our activities are
free for all, we do have costs, and need your help to make our activities
better. 

 

We are now offering Silver, Gold and Platinum sponsorship levels. There is
also a cost-effective &quot;Community Supporter&quot; option for non-profits,
government offices, small startups, and such. Of course, if you are a
Corporate Member of OWASP (at any level) and allocate a percentage (20-40%)
of your membership fees to the Israel Chapter, we consider those funds as
conference sponsorship accordingly. 

 

Early bird sponsors that sign a contract by September 1st will get a 10%
discount.

reach out to me directly.

 

Thanks!
