Dear Friends,

You are cordially invited to attend a two-day workshop on electronic voting
and its potential impact on society and democracy. The idea is to provide
multiple points of view of the potential, the dangers, and the state of the
art. The background for the workshop is the recent initiative by the
Israeli government to employ an electronic voting scheme. However, the
workshop promises to be very interesting on its own.

The workshop will take place on Sunday May 17th at IDC and Monday May 18th
at TAU. Please see more details and a schedule at the attached invitation
and also at: <A HREF="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/voting/">http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/voting/</A>


The workshop is sponsored and supported by the Check Point Institute for
Information Security.


Please circulate this invitation widely to whomever you think might be
interested. In addition, if you plan to attend, please register online at
the site above. Registration is free and can be anonymous. Its only purpose
is to help us plan the venue and refreshments.

Best,

Ronitt, Alon, Assaf and Ran
