Hi All,

Save the day! 5/9, 17:00
========================
The next meeting of OWASP Israel will be held on September 5th at 17:00.
This time Watchfire will host and sponsor the meeting. But don't rush to
bring a map: it is the building adjacent to Breach in Herzeliya. Thanks
to Ory Segal from Watchfire for organizing that.

The event will be part of the global security week (September 3rd-9th:
http://www.globalsecurityweek.com/). In this OWASP holds mini conference
and chapter meetings around the world and so will we.

More information about the OWASP and OWASP Israel chapter can be found
at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/israel.


Call for presenters
===================
If you would like to present in the meeting, please send me details of
the presentation.
