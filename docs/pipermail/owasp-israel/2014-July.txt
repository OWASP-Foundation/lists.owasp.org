Subject: [OWASP Israel] OWASP AppSec IL 2014 Conference - Call For Sponsors
Message-ID: <CFEAEB37.1F1BF%orsegal@akamai.com>

Hello Everyone,

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will take place this year on Tuesday, September 2, 2014. The conference will take place at the IDC in Herzliya, as in previous years.

OWASP Israel encourages companies to sponsor the conferences and help pay for expenses such as refreshments, photography, video etc. The conferences are not commercial and the cost goes directly to cover expenses. Since our conferences draw an increasingly large number of attendees, conference expenses also rise accordingly.

If you or your company benefit from OWASP materials and/or conferences, we encourage you to support us! Moreover, the associated publicity and community goodwill can go a long way. We have several levels of sponsorships available, appropriate for the different organizations that wish to support OWASP Israel activities. Of course, if you are an OWASP Corporate Member (at any level) and allocate a percentage (20-40%) of your membership fees to the Israeli chapter, we can consider those funds as conference sponsorship. It is also possible to be creative and find non-financial ways to support us and contribute to the successful running of the conference.

You can find more information about conference sponsorship in the following page:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IL_Sponsorship

If you have any questions, or would like your organization to sponsor the event, please contact Ory Segal: orysegal at gmail.com

We truly appreciate your help!
OWASP Israel
