that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased (partially or wholly) before, it will fall under
current research category even though there are enhancements/changes
to the original
research.

2. Current Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Submission Format
------------------------------
Email the paper to: cfp at hardwear.io
The subject should be: CFP EU 2016 <Paper Title>
Email Body:

Organization and Designation
Contact Number
Have you presented or submitted this paper at any other conference(s),
magazine(s) or portals?
Yes, No.
If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the previous
ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or are due
to be given elsewhere prior to hardwear.io will be considered as current
research category talks unless they consist of cutting edge and ground
breaking technology, which is at the judgement of the review committee.

Are you releasing an open source hardware(or specification)?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the design for review)

Are you releasing an exploit?
Yes/No.

Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

Paper Abstract ? Please provide detailed working or your
research/work. The more details you provide the better it is for the
reviewers. Please keep the abstract to the point. Please do not try to
hide the technical details or say ?I can?t disclose it till bla bla?
as it does not help the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a
low score because of insufficient information available in the
abstract. Please make sure to add as much technical details as
possible as short abstracts also tend to get low score due to
insufficient information.

Message-ID: <dcf715e537c449e2299ce2af4fa0467c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!



Next OWASP?Israel meeting will take place on Tuesday,?June *14th , 2016*?at
17:00 ? *that?s in just 2 weeks!*



The meeting will take place at Amdocs Auditorium.

Amdocs' offices are located in Raanana, 8 Hapnina St.



Agenda is below.



As always, attendance is free but we do need you to register in advance.
Stay tuned at our meetup page:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/229662688/



See you at the meeting,

Erez Metula,

OWASP?IL





*Agenda:?*



*17:00 ? Gathering, Food & drinks*



*17:30 ? Opening Note *





*17:45 ? Insiders ? The Threat is Already Within*

*Sagie Dulce:, Shiri Margel, Imperva*

*In recent years, we have witnessed a growing number of enterprises and
government agencies suffer data breaches. While organizations are buffing
up their security layers?which is important?most of the focus is on
preventing direct threats that come from outside, while detecting threats
from within is neglected. *



*In this talk we will present our research data. Our data shows that
insider threats, weather attributed to malicious, negligent or compromised
insider, go unnoticed by common security tools. In order to detect insider
attacks we suggest a mixture of Behavior Analytics and Deception
technology. These technologies were deployed in several production
environments. We then collected data from these environments and discovered
different forms of insider threats in each and every deployment. Our data
suggests that organizations are already experiencing some form of insider
attack which current security technology does not address *





*18:30 ? 1Password protects you, but how protects 1Password ?*

*Adi Ludmer, Perimiterx*



*1Password is one of the most popular Password managers in the world.*

*The most important quality for tools in this category is the level of
trust that they provide us when we let them guard our most sensitive data.*


*In this talk we will explain (and demonstrate) several flaws in the design
of 1Password?s architecture, that could potentially be exploited and put
our sensitive data which is stored there at risk.We will also explain
several flaws which have already been disclosed, and give some
recommendations for how to use Password managers in a safer way. *



*19:15 ? Coffee break *



*19:30 ? Proxy based assertion*

*Erez Kalman, Amdocs*



*Secure method of using a single proxy entry point to pass assertion data
for user authentication and authorization using the headers to other
systems *
