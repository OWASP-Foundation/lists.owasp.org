<PRE>
Just before wrapping up 2007, we will be holding OWASP IL 3rd conference on
Monday, December 3rd. Continuing our successful relationship with the
information security program at the Efi Arazi Computer Science school of the
Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya, we will hold the conference there. 

As usual, we will strive to make it one of the most professional security
events in Israel, and as always the best for professional networking. So
mark Monday, Dec 3rd starting around noon on you on your calendar.

If you would like to present at the conference, please contact me at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">ofers at breach.com</A>, or call me at +972-54-4431119 to discuss you presentation.

We are also looking for sponsors who are interested in sponsoring the event.
Sponsorship is targeted solely to cover event costs and not for any
commercial gain (and is therefore pretty cheap). Sponsors get, among other
things, a booth in the event's lobby, and have their logo on the conference
page on the OWASP site.

Further details can be found at the OWASP Israel web page at
