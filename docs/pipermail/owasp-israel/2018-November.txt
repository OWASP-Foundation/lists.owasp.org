Subject: [OWASP Israel] We're looking for a Security Champion for a Digital
 Health Application (Haifa!)
Message-ID: <DB5P101MB0070E8046D2C657B248639B499C40@DB5P101MB0070.NAMP101.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

GE's new digital health initiative in Acute Care is one of two targets on which GE and Roche Diagnostics have recently partnered. The leader in in-vivo diagnostics (GEHC) and the leader in in-vitro diagnostics (Roche) expect to make tremendous progress in the management of cancer and sepsis. Sepsis is a major challenge in medicine. Its incidence is increasing so significantly, that it is now considered an epidemic, with 250,000 deaths from sepsis per year, and approximately $19 billion of healthcare costs in the US alone.
With the Acute Care initiative, we have undertaken the challenge to reduce the incidence and costs associated with sepsis as a first target for a new digital health offering that is based in real-time sensing, biological markers, and data science. The Acute Care Data Science team in Haifa is developing novel AI and machine learning predictive and prescriptive solutions for medical practitioners using this rich and untapped medical data.
We are seeking candidates to join the Acute Care team, to develop and design innovative cyber security solutions for unique and complex technologies. The ideal candidate will demonstrate a thorough understanding of Cyber Security attack techniques and mitigation in the application level and infrastructure level.
Responsibilities:
* Application security reviews
* Review of third-party services (e.g. SaaS-providers)
* Audit, assessment, and penetration testing techniques
* Projects and research work as needed
* Security training and outreach to internal development teams
* Security guidance documentation
* Security tool development
* Security metrics delivery and improvements
Requirements -
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related field
* Minimum of 5 years of experience with any combination of the following: threat modeling experience, secure coding, identity management and authentication, software development, cryptography, system administration and network security.
* 5+ years of working knowledge and understanding of security engineering, system and network security, authentication and security protocols, cryptography, or application security
* An understanding of web services
* A team player. Collaborative and communicative. Able to adapt to change.

Subject: [OWASP Israel] OWASP Israel November meetup
Message-ID: <CAHfWneb7+xUpBKTZGCkhx_81oT971RBC9hjh=AKmHbmp37-uaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
We will have our quarterly OWASP Israel meetup in Synopsys office in
Herzliya (Maskit St 8) on November 20th.
For more details and registration -
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/255823857/

The agenda for the meetup:
17:30 - 18:00: Gathering and Networking

18:00 - 18:45: ?Scratching the Surface of your CD?? Ofer Maor, Director,
Solutions Management, Synopsys
Continuous Delivery (CD) introduces a new set of challenges for application
security testing, even compared with already fast Continuous Integration
(CI) and DevOps methodologies. CD development organization can produce
hundreds or even thousands of software updates per day, some of them taking
no longer than a few hours from beginning to end.
True continuous testing calls for true, inline, continuous security
testing, which does not rely on any dedicated testing slots. In this talk
we will talk about some of these concepts - how to streamline security
testing in the background, how to fit it into modern A/B testing cycles,
and how to build an approval process that fits a modern CD workflow, rather
than an old security go/no-go approach.

18:45 - 19:30: "Client JavaScript Security - an Oxymoron?" Hadar Blutrich,
Source Defense co-founder
Your firewall, WAF, source code review, and many other security solutions
are focused on your internal servers and their communication with your
customer 's browser. 3rd party scripts are hosted on remote servers which
are completely outside of your security system's reach and executed on the
customer 's browser over which you have no control. Thus, after every layer
of your corporate security program has already done its job, the user 's
browser is communicating with these remote servers. This means that you
have no visibility, management, or control over the behaviors and actions
of each 3rd party. Source Defense will discuss preventing JavaScript from
accessing data that the JavaScript was not intended to access.

We are working on adding another presentation to the agenda and will update
once we have more details.

Thanks,

Or Katz
OWASP Israel Chair
