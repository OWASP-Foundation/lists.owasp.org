Hi All,

I am happy to tell you that more than 120 people confirmed they are coming
to the conference, so I?m sure it will be a big success. Some updates:

* ??? ???? ????????:

	+ ????? ?? ????? ??????.

	+ ???? ?????? ????? ?????. ???? ???????! ?? ??????.

?????? ???????? ???.
	

* Volunteers needed - I need volunteers for two things:

	- I want to try to video the presentations. I am going to bring my
own video camera, but I'm looking for (a) a tripod and (b) a volunteer to
operate it. Nothing more than keeping an eye and switching tapes. If you can
help with a more professional solution all together we would welcome that.

	- We are going to have name tags and I need someone to see there at
the tags desk between 12:30 and 13:30 and help people with their tags (which
I will print in advance). Any volunteer?


* ????? ???????:

?????? ???. ????? ???????? 19:30.

* Last minutes notes -
	
	- If you did not notice, lectures start at 13:30, but you are more
than welcome to get there starting at 13:00 to meet people, socialize and
get some refreshments. We expect to finish by 19:30.

	- links to IDC maps and driving directions can be found on the
conference page at

And lastly, if you still did not register, this is the time! Apart from
being better prepared, I also prepare name tag in advance as I want them to
be printed and professional looking

Hi All,

 

Thanks for attending the OWASP Israel 2007, the 1st official OWASP
conference held in Israel. With 8 wonderful talks and around 200 people I
had a great time. I always love meeting you guys, and I hope you also
enjoyed the event as much as I did. In order for send you information about
future OWASP meetings and activities I am enrolling those of you not already
on the list to the OWASP IL mailing list. This is a VERY low volume list
that includes mostly information about our meetings. If you really don't
want to be on the list, or are already subscribed using a different e-mail
address, let me know and I will remove you.

 

Few of the presentations given in the conference are already online on the
conference page at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2007_Conferenc. I hope to get
the rest in a few days and I will e-mail the mailing list once I get them.

 

I would appreciate your comments, feedback and ideas on how to improve next
time as well as feedback to our presenters. Can you assign a grade between 1
to 5 to each of the presentations and add any written comment you have. I
will provide the speakers with your feedback without disclosing the source.
