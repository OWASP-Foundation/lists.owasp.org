Hi everyone! 

 

There is still some time to submit your proposal to speak at the best
security conference in the region - AppSecIL, this time at Tel Aviv
University! 

 

But there are only a few days left, so why not do it now!
https://www.papercall.io/appsecisrael2018 

Or submit your idea for developer training on our Training Day -
https://www.papercall.io/appsecisrael2018training 

 

The Conference will be held on September 5th (Training) and 6th
(Conference), and we are expecting 700-800 security pros, CISOs, developers,
and researchers at the Conference - aside from the 400 developers that will
attend the Training Day! 

We will be having 2 tracks of amazing, high quality content, in addition to
CtF, workshops, and more. 

And an AWESOME surprise Keynote Speaker! 

 

Oh yeah, both the Conference and Training are FREE to attend! 

Register here for one of the best security conferences around:
https://2018.appsecil.org/Register 

 

P.S. we are also still looking for sponsors, to help cover costs of keeping
this fantastic conference free. We also have cost-efficient options if do
not have budget for a booth, but would still like to support this wonderful
community - https://2018.appsecil.org/assets/AppSecIL_2018_Sponsorships.pdf 

 

Hope to see all of you there! 

 

Cheers!
