Subject: [OWASP Israel] Invitation to Eurocrypt 2018, Tel Aviv - Israel,
 Apr 29 - May 03, 2018
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1803042249330.4882@cs.haifa.ac.il>

Dear all,

Eurocrypt 2018 is one of the flagship conference of the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research (www.iacr.org). It covers a wide 
range of topics in cryptology: theory of cryptography, new ciphers,
cryptanalysis of existing ciphers (breaking them), cryptographic 
protocols, electronic elections, cryptocurrencies (e.g., bitcoin), and 
more.

For the first time, this conference will be held in Israel - at Dan 
Panorama in Tel Aviv between 29th of April and the 3rd of May. The 
conference is organized by the Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security 
Research Center at the Technion.

This year (which is the 37th one), the 69 academic papers discussing 
cutting edge cryptographic research, will be accompanied by two invited 
talks (keynotes): Prof. Anne Cantaeut will present "Desperately Seeking 
Sboxes", whereas Prof. Matthew Green will present "Thirty Years of 
Digital Currency: From DigiCash to the Blockchain".

In addition, one evening is dedicated to "fresh from the oven" 
results - short presentations discussing results in the process of 
submission, or even not submitted yet! This session (rump session, 
Tuesday) is a great place to hear about exciting results (and enjoy a 
light atmosphere).

More information (including the program, registration, sponsors, etc.) can 
be found at https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2018. Please note that early 
registration deadline ends on 15th of March.

And one final candy, on Sunday 29th (just before Eurocrypt starts), there 
will be an affiliated workshop discussing lightweight cryptography (e.g., 
cryptography for low-end devices, IoT, and similar environments). More 
information at http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/LWD/.

A poster of the conference is attached available at 
http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/Poster.pdf. We will appreciate if you 
could help in more than just participating - tell colleagues, friends, 
neighbours, about the event! (on a different note, we still look for more 
sponsors to support attendance of students in the conference, so if you 
want to help an event taking place in Israel, please let us know).

Hi All,
We are seeking presenters to the upcoming OWASP meet-ups, from the
application security community, to discuss interesting topics related to
the security of applications, from the fields of web, mobile, cloud, and
other types of software.

Some possible topics include, but are not limited to:

   - Secure development: secure coding, static analysis, application threat
   modelling, web frameworks security, countermeasures, SDLC, DevOps, etc.
   - Mobile security: Development and/or testing devices and the mobile web
   - Cloud security: Offensive and defensive considerations for cloud-based
   web applications
   - Applicative Infrastructure security: Database security, VoIP,
   hardware, identity management
   - Penetration testing: Methodologies, tools, exploit development,
   evasion techniques, OSINT, etc.
   - Emerging web technologies and associated security considerations
   - Internet of Things: IoT security and other devices
   - SCADA and Industrial Control Systems: and how these can be secured, or
   hacked, at an application or software level.
   - Applied Cryptography: Relevant research, new models, algorithm usage,
   interesting attacks, and other applications.
   - Incident response: Threat detection, triage, malware analysis,
   forensics, rootkit detection
   - OWASP tools and projects in practice
   - Policy and legal: Legislation, privacy, regulations and compliance,
   C-level considerations, etc.
   - Cool hacks and other fun stuff: cryptography, social engineering, etc.

We're looking forward for interesting and exciting talks!
Please send me email with abstract of your proposed talk and your bio.
