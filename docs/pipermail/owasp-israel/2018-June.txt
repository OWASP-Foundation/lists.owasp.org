Subject: [OWASP Israel] Call For Paper - OWASP AppSec Israel 2018
Message-ID: <CAHfWneau-Qvwba08Fo_DCNhg=QcijtMvA5qX5AOdcqc9m=b5GA@mail.gmail.com>

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference is the largest conference in
Israel for application and software security, has been going regularly for
over a decade and always draws hundreds of participants. Over 650 people
attended last year, this year we expect well over 700!

OWASP AppSec Israel will take place this year on September 6th, 2018. The
Conference usually starts at 9AM and lasts until 18:00. It will also be
preceded by a day of Developer Training.

But AppSecIL is not just for security experts! We also have talks aimed at
developers, testers, architects, product designers, and managers - anyone
involved with the software lifecycle is welcome, regardless of type of
software, website, mobile app, or any other type of application.


*If you are responsible for, or involved with:*

   - web security
   - devops security
   - cloud security
   - mobile security
   - application security
   - software development
   - quality assurance
   - software maintenance or operations


? we want to hear from you at AppSecIL!

Follow this link for submitting your paper -
https://www.papercall.io/appsecisrael2018

AppSec Israel 2018 will have two lecture tracks. There will also be a
sponsors pavilion for vendors of products and services relevant to
application security and developers, and for recruiting. Note that
sponsorship deals never include talks! The content is selected
independently of sponsors, and we do not abide ?pay for play? (i.e. $ !=
talk).

AppSec Israel always has excellent talks, but even if you?ve never done
this before - you should not be discouraged from submitting! It is very
important to us to have a diverse variety of speakers, and even if this is
your first time presenting we will ensure that you have the support needed
to give a great talk, including speaker mentorship if you want. (AppSecIL
is also a super friendly crowd, so it?s a great place to start out!)


*CFP Description*
Anything and everything AppSec! Application security, software security,
web security?

In general, the only restriction on the subject of the talks is being
related to Application Security or Software Security in some way (not
necessarily Web). We will not accept any talks regarding other aspects of
Security, that are not applicative in nature. Talks at any technical level
can be accepted.

We especially appreciate talks from security folk in large organizations
(?security consumers?) who can share different Case Studies from the field.
Specifically, the topics we look for include, but are not limited to, the
following subject areas:


   - Secure development: secure coding, static analysis, application threat
   modelling, web frameworks security, countermeasures, SDLC, DevOps, etc.
   - Mobile security: Development and/or testing devices and the mobile web
   - Cloud security: Offensive and defensive considerations for cloud-based
   web applications
   - Applicative Infrastructure security: Database security, VoIP,
   hardware, identity management, serverless and containers framework
   - Penetration testing: Methodologies, tools, exploit development,
   evasion techniques, OSINT, etc.
   - Emerging web technologies and associated security x`considerations
   - Internet of Things: IoT security and other devices
   - SCADA and Industrial Control Systems: and how these can be secured, or
   hacked, at an application or software level.
   - Applied Cryptography: Relevant research, new models, algorithm usage,
   interesting attacks, and other applications.
   - Incident response: Threat detection, triage, malware analysis,
   forensics, rootkit detection
   - OWASP tools and projects in practice
   - Policy and legal: Legislation, privacy, regulations and compliance,
   C-level considerations, etc.
   - Cool hacks and other fun stuff: cryptography, social engineering, etc.


AppSecIL will include 2 lecture tracks. The specific division of these
tracks will be decided later, but it will likely be aligned with OWASP?s
Builders / Breakers / Defenders nomenclature:


   - Builders: Targeting developers, testers, and managers involved in the
   secure software development lifecycle.
   - Breakers: Focusing on matters relevant to penetration testers,
   researchers, and other security professionals.
   - Defenders: Emphasizing operations issues affecting infrastructure
   security teams, administrators, support, etc.
   - Policy and Legal: Addressing privacy, compliance, and legal issues
   affecting development and security communities.


Since we usually get many more ?Breaker? talks than Builder or Defender
talks, we may give extra weight for these.

Subject: [OWASP Israel] Call for Training Announcement - AppSec Israel 2018
Message-ID: <CAPHzLZoQfs=qOqiHpgrP7QJVGO7i3Yh0HVnKQ9Zw8QshOe+puw@mail.gmail.com>

This year, in addition to the exciting AppSec Israel conference we are once
again organising a full day of training.

The Training Day will take place on Wednesday, September 5th, 2018 ? right
before the AppSec Israel Conference in the same location (Tel Aviv
University) and will be free to attend.

The training will be mostly aimed at developers and newcomers to
application security but also at those with slightly more experience with
the goal of improving the security of all software and growing the pool of
skilled professionals in the field.

We are now calling for pro-bono trainers who are willing to support the
Israeli AppSec community and submit proposals to deliver this training. The
format has changed slightly this year and we are looking for multiple
trainers to volunteer to deliver, hands-on, workshop-style training in
English lasting between 1.5 and 3 hours although we would also be
interested in proposals for a full day of training.. The training will
remain single track. We are also intending to provide travel assistance
this year if necessary.

Topics we are interesting in seeing in proposals include:
*    Workshops on common (OWASP Top 10 2017) attacks and their mitigations

*    Secure development with modern paradigms such as Single Page
Applications and WebSockets.
*    General application security mechanisms
*    Secure coding guidelines

Please submit your proposal here:
<https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/91874/owasp-global-training-tour-tel-aviv-israel-rishon-10-17-2017>
https://www.papercall.io/appsecisrael2018training

The CFT closes at 23:59 (GMT+3) on 25th July 2018.

Acceptance notifications should start from 8th August 2018.

The CFT team will select the training based on content, quality of
submission, and expertise of trainer(s), and are completely independent of
any vendor or sponsor support.

However, preference will be given to submissions which:

*    Make use of OWASP projects as part of the workshops

*    Provide content and exercises which the attendees can take home with
them

*    Refer to modern technologies such as (but not limited to) node.js, Go,
Python, Scala

*    Have a strong interactive and hands-on focus.

Benefits for trainers:

*    Trainers will be invited to take part in the speaker?s dinner after
the conference itself

*    Training slides can be branded with the trainer?s company (but must
not be focused on the company?s products)

*    Trainers are welcome to give out swag during their sessions


Please forward this information to relevant people or companies who might
be interested in delivering this high-impact training.
