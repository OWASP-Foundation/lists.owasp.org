Subject: [OWASP Israel] Security Architect - NCR
Message-ID: <5F2C66A2-0393-4219-B86C-F14645F3C607@ncr.com>

Hello OWASP folks,

I am looking for a Security Architect candidate to join a new team in NCR (formerly Retalix, but the scope of this position is much bigger).
Earlier this year, the Retail Division of NCR established a new organization focused on Payments, Security and Cloud Services. The Security Architect will be part of this new and dynamic team that centralizes all security efforts in one place (including building security tools for internal use). To be more specific about the role in Israel ? the Security Architect will own the security of the CTO organization, which is focused on the latest technologies and the innovation of the division.

The mandatory requirements are:
- NCR needs the Bar Refaeli of the application security!  Thus, a VERY deep application security knowledge is required.
- I?m located in the US, thus the candidate must have self motivation and leadership capabilities.
- Being able to translate <IMG onmouseover="alert('xxs')?> to a management level.
- Must have experience in Console.WriteLine(?Hello World?);
- International customer facing experience. If you wonder, I don?t mean selling merchandise in Goa.
- Fluent English speaking.

The official application link is here: https://ncr.taleo.net/careersection/3/jobdetail.ftl?job=677744&lang=en&media_id=33335&src=OWASP
If you want more details, please reply to me directly.

Regards,
Nir Valtman
If you think that security is expensive, try to ignore it!
