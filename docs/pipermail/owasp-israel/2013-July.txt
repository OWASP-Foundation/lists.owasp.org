Subject: [OWASP Israel] Pythonect 0.6.0 released + Hacking Like It's 2013
	Slides
Message-ID: <CAD-_V77eJ2tTuFhHaXuTtupoHABmO8uruxEMZ+P0uSoaRN3kFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce the 0.6.0 release of Pythonect:
http://www.pythonect.org

Pythonect is a new, experimental, general-purpose dataflow programming
language based on Python. It provides both a visual programming language
and a text-based scripting language. The text-based scripting language aims
to combine the quick and intuitive feel of shell scripting, with the power
of Python. The visual programming language is based on the idea of a
diagram with ?boxes and arrows?.

Pythonect interpreter (and reference implementation) is a free and open
source software written completely in Python. It is available under the the
BSD 3-Clause License.

Earlier this year I gave a talk at a few conferences called 'Hacking Like
2013' (slides: http://www.ikotler.org/HackLikeIts2013_RVASec.pdf and
https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2013ams/materials/D1LAB%20-%20Itzik%20Kotler%20-%20Hack%20Like%20It%27s%202013.pdf)
in there I explain and show my vision for Pythonect as a tool for IT
Security Professionals.

Among the examples you can find in the slides are simple web pentest
scripts, fuzzers/fuzzing scripts, and some basic malware analysis
automation.

Pythonect is still a work in progress and I'd be happy to hear your
thoughts and feedback on it. Also, I am looking for interesting case
studies and uses for Pythonect, and I am willing to do some development
from my side to make it work.

Feel free to contact me off the list.

P.S.

The SMALL (Simple Malware Analysis Language) source code can be found at:

Itzik Kotler | http://www.ikotler.org
