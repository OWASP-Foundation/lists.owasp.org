<PRE>Hi, your account has been infected! Renew the password this time!

You do not know anything about me and you may be probably surprised for what reason you're reading this particular letter, proper?

I'm hacker who exploitedyour emailand all devicesnot so long ago.
Never try out to msg me or alternatively seek for me, it's impossible,
because I forwarded you this message using YOUR hacked account.

I've installed special program on the adult videos (porno) site
and guess that you visited this site to have fun (you understand what I mean).

While you have been keeping an eye on video clips,
your internet browser started out to act like a RDP (Remote Control)
having a keylogger that provided me access to your screen and network camera.

Then, my softobtainedall information.
You have typed passcodes on the online resources you visited, I caught them.
Surely, you are able change each of them, or have already modified them.
However it doesn't matter, my program renews needed data regularly.

What actually I have done?
I generated a reserve copy of every your system. Of all the files and each contact.
I formed a dual-screen videofile.
The first part displays the film that you were watching (you have got an interesting preferences, ahahhh...),
and the second screen displays the recording from your own camera.

What exactly should you do?
Clearly, I think, $755(USD) will be a fair price for our small riddle.
You will make the deposit by bitcoins
(if you do not understand this, go searching &quot;how to purchase bitcoin&quot; in any search engine).

My bitcoin wallet address: 1PAcoXVyzBDRryyg3MAmBQhDuofNYu55Uo
(It is cAsE sensitive, so copy and paste it).

Important:
You will have 2 days in order to make the payment.
(I have an unique pixel in this letter, and at the moment I understand that you've read through this email).

To tracethe reading of a messageand the actionsin it, I utilizea Facebook pixel.

Thanks to them. (That whichis usedfor the authorities may helpus.)

In case I fail to get bitcoins,
I shall undoubtedly send your video files to each of your contacts, along with relatives, co-workers, etc?

</PRE>
