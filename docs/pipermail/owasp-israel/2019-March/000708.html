<PRE>Hi Everyone! 

 

As previously announced, the OWASP Israel chapter will be hosting OWASP
Global AppSec Tel Aviv, on May 26-30, 2019.

3 days of Training and other activities, and then 2 days of exciting content
at the Conference! We expect hundreds of OWASP leaders and security
professionals worldwide to be joining us, with over 600 participating. Our
theme this year is &quot;AppSec: The Community of Innovation&quot;. 

Website: <A HREF="https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/">https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/</A> 

 

As you probably know, OWASP is a global, non-profit organization, supported
by its members and our events. 

But we need your help to support us and help make this conference a success!


 

A Global AppSec sponsor booth is an excellent place to reach many of your
target audience, with so many of our industry attending - security
researchers, CISOs, appsec practitioners, security-aware developers and
managers. And not just from Israel, at this event we will be hosting several
hundred from the international community, from Europe, US, and the rest of
the world. 

This is the place to reach them all! 

 

This is really a great opportunity to reach a wider, global audience -
details on our sponsorship options here:

I should point out that this is a separate, and very different type of event
from our usual AppSec Israel regional conference, with a much higher
production value, and a week's worth of events and activities. As fabulous
as our regular AppSecIL usually is, this is now a one-time opportunity to
have this Global event right here in our community! 

 

I look forward to discussing with you how your company can support the
event, and the community.

 

Cheers! 

Avi D
