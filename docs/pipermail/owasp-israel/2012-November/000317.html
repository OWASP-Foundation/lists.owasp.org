<PRE>The OWASP Jerusalem chapter will have its first meeting in two weeks, on
November 22nd. NDS has graciously agreed to host the group. They are
located at Shlomo Momo Halevi Street. 5, Har Hotzvim. There is a parking
area above the buildings (before the electric gate) as well as several bus
lines that stop near by. If you plan on coming please drop me an email so
that we can gauge the amount of space needed. The agenda for the meeting is
as follows:

*Schedule:*
18:15-18:45 &#8211; Gathering/Networking
18:45-19:15 &#8211; Introduction to CRIME (by Guy Barnhart-Magen)
19:15-19:45 - A is for Anonymous and Application Layer DoS Attacks (by Josh
Amishav-Zlatin)
19:45-20:00 &#8211; conclusion and wrap-up

*Presentation Abstracts:*

*Introduction to CRIME:*
In a recent conference the research pair that introduced the BEAST attack
on SSL found a new and exciting way to attack SSL from a different
direction. The new attack, named CRIME, makes it possible to hijack the
session for transactions over HTTPS (such as google, paypal, ebay, citibank
etc). This talk will explore the scenario and the attack vector on SSL,
with some background on the security mechanism chosen for attack here.

*A is for Anonymous and Application Layer DoS Attacks:*
Denial of service (DoS) attacks are like an annoying pest that wont go
away. DoS attacks are a persistent problem on the Internet, which are
extremely difficult to solve in a scalable fashion. According to WHID data,
Denial of Service attacks make up a very significant portion of web based
attacks. Despite efforts to code your app securely, a malicious user with
minimum bandwidth might still be able to take your application offline at
will. In this talk, we will focus on Slow HTTP DoS attacks which have been
a popular attack method by various hacktivist groups such as Anonymous. We
will also discuss several techniques that can be used to mitigate this
threat.
