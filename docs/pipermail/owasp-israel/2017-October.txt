The Training Day on Tuesday, October 17, 2017 will be a full day of
application security topics, aimed at software developers, QA engineers, and
anyone new to the AppSec field.

The Training event will be conducted by a professional security trainer,
hired by OWASP Global, and free to attend. 

Specific details are being finalized, and will be published shortly at

Hi, 

 

Regrettably, we have received some reports of the website being flagged as a
false positive by some outdated antivirus or commercial network edge
products. (Notably Sophos and ESET). A likely cause is that some commercial
vendors refuse to accept Let?s Encrypt certificates. 

This in effect blocks some of you from reaching the website. 

 

I am sorry if you have had difficulty registering, or seeing the agenda.  

I would like to reiterate that our site is completely safe, and is
automatically re-generated from simple markdown files (you are welcome to
review the GitHub repo if you like :) ). TLS is configured very securely,
and receives an A+ from SSLLabs
(https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=appsecil.org
<https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=appsecil.org&latest>
&latest). 

 

If you are currently being blocked  by your AV or VPN from reaching the
site, here are a few recommendations: 

-         Update your antivirus definitions. 

-         Swap your ?security? products to those that work properly in
modern networks.

-         In the meantime you can register here:
https://appsecil2017.eventbrite.com/ 

-         The schedule only can be seen here:
https://owaspappsecisrael2017.sched.com/ 

:) 

 

P.S. If you work with developers & QA engineers, or if your workplace has
R&D teams, or if you have family or friends that would be interested  ?
please let them know about the free Secure Development Training
<https://appsecil.org/Training>  day on October 17th! We want to help as
many developers as possible, in order to meet our mission: making software
security visible, and helping secure the world?s applications.

Message-ID: <CANDNuK6JcM=X9v3UYcYw8bALH0y3-FOOtsFeqq_ZwkpHCp+bDw@mail.gmail.com>

Appsec Israel is less than two weeks away and we are working hard getting
everything done.
As in past years we are happy for all the help we can get and we are
building a team of volunteers for the event days.

The core team of volunteers will be doing some or all of the following
roles:

   - Hospitality
   - Lecture room hosts
   - Crowd control
   - Logistics
   - Go-fer'ing

Additionally we are looking for volunteers to do one of these specialized
roles:

   - Survey management - writing conference surveys and analyzing the
   responses
   - Resume assessment booth - we will designate a booth where anyone can
   come and have his/her resume assessed by professionals

So if you can donate an hour or more to any of the roles above the
community will really appreciate it. Please contact me by e-mail.

Cheers,
Hemed

Last year over 650 people attended, and we expect over 700 this year ? don?t

The AppSec Israel 2017 Conference will have two lecture tracks from an
amazing group of speakers, and additional activities such as a Capture the
Flag competition. 

We also host a sponsors pavilion with vendor booths to promote the latest
advances in security technology relevant to application security and
developers. Many of our sponsors are also recruiting. 

 

The Training Day on Tuesday, October 17, 2017 will be a full day of
application security topics, aimed at software developers, QA engineers, and
anyone new to the AppSec field.

The Training event will be conducted by a professional security trainer,
hired by OWASP Global, and free to attend. 

Specific details are being finalized, and will be published shortly at
https://appsecil.org/Training. 

 

Both the Conference and Training are free to attend, but registration is

Workshops: also at https://appsecil.org/Activities 

 

 

This year for the first time, we will be hosting a Resume Review / CV
Critique workshop!

So many talented young professionals in the AppSec field (and some not so
young) miss out on great opportunities in which they would excel, and bring
amazing value to their employers. Often, this happens because of a
lackluster resume or CV, which does not properly showcase their talent and
abilities.

We are recruiting experienced managers, interviewers, and HR professionals
to help you improve your resume, and offer tips to better show off what you
can do - and get you in the door at the right employer! 

Remember to bring your resume or CV with you! (Preferably paper printout, as
that is easier to review).

 

P.S. We are still looking for a few more people to donate some time to help
those with less experience (or none). If you review resumes or interview
potential employees all day long ? please let Hemed (hemed.gur.ary at owasp.org
<mailto:hemed.gur.ary at owasp.org> ) know if you are willing to help! 

 

 

Don?t miss out, register before you forget! https://appsecil.org/Register

https://appsecil.org/Register 

 

Don?t miss your chance! Only a very few seats left for the Training

You can find and cancel your order here:
https://www.eventbrite.com/mytickets/ 

 

We also still have some space for the WIA event <https://appsecil.org/WIA> .


We are expecting around 700 people to attend the Conference
<https://appsecil.org/Agenda> , you can still join them! 

 

Since many have asked, both the Conference and the Training will be in
English, as mentioned previously. 

This is part of the conference ?growing up?, in response to international
demand and especially leading up to next year?s AppSecEU, and in line with
our statistics.

 

We do still need volunteers, for both days ? if you are willing to donate
some of your time to help keep things running smoothly, please be in touch
with Hemed - hemed.gur.ary at owasp.org <mailto:hemed.gur.ary at owasp.org>

Starting on Tuesday, October 17th with the Training Day for developers.
https://appsecil.org/Training 

 

Tuesday evening with the special mentoring session and career advice, for
women only, at WIA. https://appsecil.org/WIA 

 

The main AppSecIL conference will be next Wednesday, October 18th ? 2
tracks, amazing lectures, fantastic sponsors, exciting competition, helpful
workshops! 

Agenda: https://appsecil.org/Agenda 

Capture the Flag: https://appsecil.org/Activities 

Workshops: also at https://appsecil.org/Activities 

 

 

This year for the first time, we will be hosting a Resume Review / CV
Critique workshop!

So many talented young professionals in the AppSec field (and some not so
young) miss out on great opportunities in which they would excel, and bring
amazing value to their employers. Often, this happens because of a
lackluster resume or CV, which does not properly showcase their talent and
abilities.

We are recruiting experienced managers, interviewers, and HR professionals
to help you improve your resume, and offer tips to better show off what you
can do - and get you in the door at the right employer! 

Remember to bring your resume or CV with you! (Preferably paper printout, as
that is easier to review).

 

P.S. We are still looking for a few more people to donate some time to help
those with less experience (or none). If you review resumes or interview
potential employees all day long ? please let Hemed (hemed.gur.ary at owasp.org
<mailto:hemed.gur.ary at owasp.org> ) know if you are willing to help! 

 

 

Don?t miss out, register before you forget! https://appsecil.org/Register 

 

Much thanks to our generous sponsors, for supporting our community and
enabling us to improve the conference, while still keeping it free for
everybody!
