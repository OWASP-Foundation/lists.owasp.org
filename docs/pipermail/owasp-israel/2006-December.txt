Subject: [Owasp-israel] Next OWASP meeting Wed 24/1/2007 - Call for papers
	and sponsors
Message-ID: <02E766F69AF6AC48B9CF52ABC0DA11E101C6AE28@MERCEDES.utopiasystems.net>

 

Hi All,

 

???? ?? ????! ?????? ???? ?? OWASP IL ???? ?-24/1/2006 ???? 17:00. ??????? ?????.

 

Mark the date! The next OWASP IL chapter meeting will be held on January 24th 2007 at 17:00. Details to follow.

 

At this time I would to announce:

 

- Call for papers: anyone interested in presenting in a coming OWASP event is invited to suggest a topic. Please send me at least a title and an abstract.

 

- Call for sponsors: If you are interested in sponsoring this OWASP meeting or a future one, please let me know. See details about sponsoring below.

 

Regular meeting sponsorship: you provide the meeting place (at least for 40 people) and refreshments. In return you get:

            - People coming to your office and knowing about you.

            - Banner on the meeting page at OWASP.org

            - Placing roll ups (well it is your place) 

- Distributing marketing materials to the group.

- As for speaking opportunity ? you will have a priority in getting a speaking slot, but only if the you have somebody who can talk about something interesting to the group and not about your produts and services, and for now I'm the judge.

 

Conference meetings: after the success of the last event at IDC, we are going to have an additional such event in around 6 months. Such a meeting may get as many as 100 attendees. In return for sharing the refreshments cost (depends on the number of sponsoring companies, I just split the sum between them) you get:

            - Placing roll ups (well it is your place) 

            - Banner on the conference page at OWASP.org

- Distributing marketing materials to the attendees.

 

I do also expect sponsors to help by sending invitations out to their mailing list. 

 

I also do not rule out additional sponsorship for a normal meeting, but naturally the additional sponsor cannot compete with the company where the meeting is held.

Subject: [Owasp-israel] No more monthly password reminder
Message-ID: <02E766F69AF6AC48B9CF52ABC0DA11E101D5FA8E@MERCEDES.utopiasystems.net>

 

A member has asked so I changed the list options not to send a monthly
password reminder for security reason. 

 

If someone feel this is inconvenient please e-mail me and tell me why,
I'm sure we will find a solution.
