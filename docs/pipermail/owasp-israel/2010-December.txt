Hi All,

 

While not directly OWASP, it is in very much related to web security.  So -
if you haven't already heard or been invited, enclosed is an invitation to
the CSA Israel convention for this Thursday. Please confirm with Guy Alfassi
if you wish to attend. 

 

Also - we will have an OWASP Israel meeting in January (11/1). We already
have venue and most lectures, and I will send an invitation next week (If
you would like to present there, please let me know..)

 

CSA Israel Invitation

 

The next meeting of our chapter will take place on Thursday, December 23rd,
14:00, at CA offices in Herzelia.

The meeting will present the various aspects in which CSA (and its Israeli
chapter) can help and interest you:

We'll review the new concepts and technologies, as presented at the global
CSA event that took place in Orlando last month (next best thing to actually
being there.)

We'll look at the new cloud security certification program (CCSK). 

We'll officially launch the Israeli chapter's unique contribution to CSA:
The technology showcase wiki.

We'll discuss one of the cloud's most important security aspects - Identity
and Access management.

We'll hear two vendors, a major player and a startup, describe their
approach to cloud security.

We'll learn from the experience of a company already practicing cloud
security in the real world, 

and we'll broaden our horizons with a guest presentation from our very
cooperative friendly cousins at OWASP.

The agenda for the upcoming meeting is as follows:


* Highlights of the CSA event in Orlando - Guy Alfassi, Alfa Consulting
* CCSK -  Ariel Litvin, PWC
* Cloud Identity and Access Management - Hadass Harel, eBay
* The Technology Showcase Wiki - Iftach Amit, Security Art
* Security management to, for, and from the cloud - Oded Tzur, CA
* OWASP Israel & Introduction to OWASP Top 10- Ofer Maor, Hacktics & OWASP
Israel
* Practical Enterprise use cases of  data protection in the cloud - Guy
Bejerano, LivePerson
* Navajo Systems' Virtual Private SAAS - TBD

Attendance is free, but requires prior registration.
Please respond through LinkedIn or drop me an email and say you're coming
(guy at alfaconsulting.co.il), so we can prepare the logistics accordingly.

Looking forward to seeing you there,

Guy Alfassi, on behalf of the CSA Israel board

The OWASP Global Summit is *the* place where application security experts
meet to discuss plans, projects and solutions for the future of application
security. The Summit is *not* a conference - there are no talks or training
seminars - this is an opportunity to do *actual work* to further the field
of application security. Participants will stay in shared accommodations and
collaborate to produce tangible progress towards influencing standards,
establishing roadmaps, and setting the tone for OWASP and application
security for the coming years.

Get involved, change the world
