Subject: [OWASP Israel] AppSec Israel 2018 - It's a Wrap!
Message-ID: <CAHfWneYZDDuRthFewoMEwGYJ78baxS28Vmu4hXBDrmsuCkvFHw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I would like to thank all of those that attended, presented, sponsored and
helped with the organization of AppSec Israel 2018! Here are few of the
highlights from this year events:

   - Nearly *700* people attend on the conference day, *300* on training
   day and over *70* on WIA event
   - We had *29* sponsors that supported us and enabled this conference
   being as successful as it was
   - We had *22* sessions speakers and *2* keynote speakers on conference
   day and *2 *industry leading trainers on training day
   - Other activities during the conference day: CtF and CV workshop

But the most important outcome of this year AppSec Israel conference was
the testimony of the strength of our community. Moving forward what will
continue to guide our chapter activities are principles of free education
and full visibility to all out community members.

I would also like to remind you all that OWASP foundation global election
will be at the end of September and our former chapter chairman Ofer Maor
is running for the board therefore I encourage you all to become a OWASP
member, vote for Ofer and to support him in any possible way.
Membership fee is $50 a year and it provides significant discounts to any
global OWASP conference.
For more information on Ofer's resume -

I would also like to invite you to participate in our activities throughout
the year including attending, presenting or otherwise assisting to, helping
to constantly improve our community.

Finally we would like to get your feedback on this year conference by
filling this survey - AppSec Israel 2018 Survey

Thanks,

*Or Katz and OWASP Israel Board*
