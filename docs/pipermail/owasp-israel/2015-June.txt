Subject: [OWASP Israel] Chapter meeting + Other Announcements
Message-ID: <SNT404-EAS355CE7BCCD9A2554ACD34CBB1AD0@phx.gbl>

We had another great meeting last week, thanks to everyone for coming! We
had over 120 people, and 3 great talks. 

Thanks to Microsoft for hosting us, and putting on such a lovely event. 

Also thanks to Moshe Ferber and CSA Israel for helping set it all up. 

 

All the presentations from all three talks are available here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_June_2015 

There are also some pictures from the event, uploaded to
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8J0WK4IGF11MElhR08tb1hDVkE
<https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8J0WK4IGF11MElhR08tb1hDVkE&usp=sha
ring> &usp=sharing (Thanks Moshe!) If you have any more, feel free to share
them. 

Thanks to Itay, Tal, Almog, and Julia for sharing their fantastic talks with
us! 

 

 

Another few announcements, as I mentioned at the meeting: 

 

1.      AppSec USA (https://2015.appsecusa.org/) - anyone planning on
attending the upcoming AppSecUSA conference in September, is invited to use
our chapter's discount code - US2015_IS. This will grant you a $100 discount
per ticket - and, if enough of our members use this, possibly a little
something extra - like a free ticket(s) to be raffled off to the chapter
members! 
So please register using the discount code - US2015_IS. 

 

2.      OWASP Israel chatroom - the OWASP Foundation has recently opened a
Slack for the entire OWASP community. (For those unfamiliar with Slack, it
is like IRC on steroids - or, a hipster version of a chatroom - but very
sleek and useful). 
You can register for OWASP's Slack here: http://owasp.herokuapp.com/ After
you sign up, you will have access to various chatrooms with other OWASP
members around the world, including some dedicated to specific areas of
learning. 
Specifically, I opened a chatroom for our local chapter -
https://owasp.slack.com/messages/chapter-israel/. Feel free to discuss any
local issue, argue about security in Hebrew (it works, I checked), or just
idle community chitchat. I hope this will be a useful resource for the
community (and, of course, if it is not, then don't feel any pressure to
make it active - it is there if you want it!)

 

3.      While I'm talking about that, I will mention our other presence on
other social networks - make sure to join/follow/subscribe to them all! 

*         Twitter - https://twitter.com/OWASP_IL 

*         Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/groups/owasp.il/

*         LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=39702 

*         This mailing list :) -
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel 

*         And of course the chapter webpage -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Israel 

 

4.      Saving the best for last.. SAVE THE DATE! Our big yearly conference,
AppSecIL 2015, has been scheduled! The conference will take place Monday,
October 12th (one week after Sukkot). Watch this space for news about a
change in venue, and other updates! 

 

Cheers!
