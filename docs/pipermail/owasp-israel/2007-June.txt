Subject: [Owasp-israel] Feedback on the presentation at OWASP IL IDC
Message-ID: <50E6558DF2E9624DA8DADDE0C50184863E4B78@midas.utopiasystems.net>

 

Thanks all of you for the feedback you provided on the last OWASP IL
event at IDC. This feedback is both important for me when organizing the
next meeting and to the speakers. I have shared with each speaker his
average score, ranking position and your remarks (anonymously).

 

The interesting point was the varied feedback I got. So if you did not
like a presentation, it does not necessarily mean it was bad. It might
have been very interesting to others.

 

Some general remarks worth sharing with all:

 

+ Erez Metula's presentation on .Net reverse engineering got very good
feedback, but the remarks indicate that it requires a different format
due to its length and technical details. I'm thinking about splitting
such an event next time into lectures and tutorials more suitable for
longer and deeper technical discussion.

 

+ While David's Lewis presentation on application security management
did not fit well the audience, there was a general agreement that the
subject is important. If anyone has an idea how to present this topic so
it is digestible to OWASP techies, let me know.
