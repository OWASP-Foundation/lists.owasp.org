Dear Hacking-Lab & OWASP User,

the 4'th challenge to win a ticket is now open.


Countdown Challenges -- Win Free Tickets to AppSec EU Research 2013 in Hamburg!


The OWASP German Chapter will host the OWASP AppSec Europe Research 2013 global conference in Hamburg, Germany from August 20-23. The event will be composed of 2 days of training (August 20-21), followed by 2 days of conference talks (August 22-23). The conference is expected to draw 400-500 technologists from Research, Government, Financial Services, Media, Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare, Technology and many other verticals.

Visit the conference page  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2013  for details.

There will be a challenge posted on the conference wiki page every month up until the event in August. The winner of each challenge will get free entrance to the conference, worth about ?420. Be sure to sign up for the conference mailing list  https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013  to get a monthly reminder.
