Agenda:

17:30

Gathering, Socializing and Pizzas

18:00

Introduction to OWASP &amp; the WebScarab project as an example to OWASP
activities
Ofer Shezaf, OWASP Israel Chair, CTO Breach Security
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.breach.com">http://www.breach.com</A>&gt; 

OWASP is an important organization for application security
professionals as it defines some of the most influential references in
this area, including the OWASP guide and the OWASP top 10. Coming back
from the OWASP conference and chapters chairs meeting in London, I will
present the organization, its goals and direction. I will also present
to you how you can benefit and contribute to OWASP.

WebScarab is one of OWASP premier projects and serves as a good example
for OWASP projects. It is an open source tool for application security
auditors for analyzing web applications. The presentation will introduce
WebScarab and its more interesting features.

18:45

Managing web development form a security standpoint - common mistakes
and pitfalls
Ariel Pisetski, CSO NetVision &lt;<A HREF="http://www.netvision.co.il">http://www.netvision.co.il</A>&gt;  

While application security is becoming one of the major information
security concerns, and as such get a lot of attention from information
security professionals, most developers lack knowledge and awareness
regarding the issue. In order to reach sufficient security for
applications the information security professional has to work hand in
hand with development teams.

Ariel Pisetski, who as the CSO of NetVision is in charge of the security
of popular applications such as NetAction and Nana, as well as numerous
applications hosted at NetVision will share with us his view on how to
create secure applications and present common mistakes and pitfalls
during development that affect the final application's security.

19:30

Unconventional SQL injection
Ofer Shezaf, OWASP Israel Chair, CTO Breach Security
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.breach.com">http://www.breach.com</A>&gt; 

SQL injection is becoming an &quot;old story&quot;. Most developers assume that if
they check that their login form is not vulnerable to SQL injection, the
application is secure. Newer attack techniques, such as automated SQL
injection, show that the simplest &quot;glitch&quot; and at times even correct
behavior of the application can lead to severe damage caused by SQL
injection. The presentation will talk about these techniques, present
real world examples and solutions for protecting against these issues.

20:00
