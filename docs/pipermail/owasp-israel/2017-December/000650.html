<PRE>Hello,

Today, I am sorry to share some bad news.

I am sure most of you have heard that our local community was intended to host next year's Global Conference, AppSec Europe 2018, here in Tel Aviv. Many of you were excited. We had planned out a remarkable event, which would have proved to be one of the biggest and most successful AppSecEU's yet, and would have served as an excellent fundraiser for OWASP's activities. Both thanks in large part to the local industry and the amazing community here.

Sadly, the OWASP Leadership have made the unprecedented decision to cancel the event.
Even though we had strictly followed all of OWASP's process, and were well on track to fulfilling all of the organization's goals for the event at very low risk, they have decided to restart the conference planning and organization in a new location, after more than half way through the process, instead of hosting AppSec Europe in Tel Aviv with the full support of the local community. Apparently, the OWASP Leadership does not consider Israel (the &quot;cyber capital of the world&quot;) to be an &quot;appropriate&quot; location for a Global AppSec conference.

To be absolutely clear: The OWASP Israel chapter is vehemently opposed to this move, and we do not accept nor agree with the official statement in any way.
This action, moving the conference location without cause halfway through planning, is unprecedented for any community or similar organization. This is a black mark on the OWASP Foundation, and how it conducts itself with the many volunteers worldwide that have been willing, until now, to step forward and invest their time in promoting OWASP and its cause. The Foundation's claim for transparency has been severely damaged through this terribly political and opaque process, and the misleading statement they have issued.

It should be noted that this decision was made WITHOUT consulting with the local chapter and conference committee, or even gathering the relevant information from us. No one from OWASP Israel was even allowed to provide accurate data on the situation before this vote was finalized. It is simply inconceivable that a responsible organization would allow such a decision to be made without hearing from the people involved. This decision, made without critical information, completely disregards the existing process and rejects the community efforts involved. This course of action makes clear that the decision is not based on facts, planning status, or current estimates.

There has been a lot of strategic miscommunication from OWASP Leadership, and even in the public announcement of the move there are numerous statements that are noticeably incorrect. Even the manner in which it was sent, deliberately delaying giving the Conference Team an answer until Friday night while many of us are already away for the weekend or offline for Shabbat, and right before the Leadership all leave for weeks of holidays, is illustrative of the type of pseudo-transparent tactics that are being used.

For those of you that are interested, I have posted all the relevant facts as they are, as a counter to their claims. You can read the full refutation here: <A HREF="https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/owasp-you-keep-saying-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means-avid">https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/owasp-you-keep-saying-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means-avid</A> . I will also share the link to the recording of the Board of Directors' meeting.

We want to thank the many volunteers who have donated many hundreds of hours of their time to work relentlessly to make this event happen, and apologize for OWASP Foundation's shameful behavior. We as a community do appreciate it greatly, and we asked for your help based on the assumption of OWASP Foundation's good will towards its community, and commitment to advancing its mission. We are shocked by this recent shift in OWASP culture to exclude local communities that are outside the popular centers such as London, and prioritize personal politics and short-term financial gains (no matter how tenuous or imaginary) over long-term community growth and progress in our mission.

We also apologize for OWASP Foundation to those that have already paid for travel arrangements, initiated visa processes, or made other commitments around this once-great event. We do invite you to attend the other fantastic events happening here in Tel Aviv that week, and also our other amazing conferences such as AppSecIL later in the year. I will personally endeavor to make your visit worthwhile :)

Though my love for OWASP is great (as many of you know), I now have to state that the OWASP Foundation is no longer tenable. A decision has not yet been made as to what sort of relationship we can continue to have. The local Chapter leaders (Or, Ofer, Yossi, Hemed, and myself) are discussing our options, and considering what is best for the future of our community and how we can continue to function as a healthy, vibrant community. We appreciate your feedback, and would love to hear your thoughts. You can reach us privately via email, or publicly on twitter or in comments here: <A HREF="https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/owasp-you-keep-saying-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means-avid">https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/owasp-you-keep-saying-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means-avid</A>

I want to reiterate what I always say at our fantastic AppSecIL conference: Regardless of what the OWASP Leadership believes about the AppSec community in Israel, we have the privilege of having one of the strongest, most active OWASP communities in the world. With over 700 people participating in AppSecIL every year, and dozens of AppSec vendors supporting the community both locally and globally, we have substantial influence in global markets.

I call on all of you to let the OWASP Leadership know that this declaration of animosity for our local community is unacceptable. Though this pains me greatly, I would like everyone's help with sharing this, especially to those that are planning on attending or speaking at AppSecEU.

For those companies that usually support or sponsor OWASP Foundation and AppSec conferences, I call on you to continue to support the OWASP communities and its mission - but support the local chapters that are actually doing the work, the projects that are building tools to help in our mission, and all the amazing volunteers around the world who bring their passion to our cause. Do not continue to prop up a toxic organization that sabotages its community and deals in bad faith with its volunteers.

And to all the other fantastic communities, chapters, and projects that are so dedicated to our shared cause of bringing application security to everyone - &quot;making software security visible&quot; - I would recommend you consider this as a cautionary tale, and review your commitment and obligations towards an organization that is willing to throw its volunteers off a cliff for personal reasons and imaginary dollars (or euros). Dedicate yourself to your community, whether local or global, instead of the toxic Foundation that measures the worth of your community based on how many dollars can be collected from your members, and not their actual contributions. Ensure your community can survive - and thrive - despite sabotage from the very people that should be most supporting you. And while OWASP absolutely requires plenty of funds to operate, remember that it is the many wonderful volunteers that get stuff done and achieve our mission. The dollars and euros are the nuts and bolts in the vehicle, but it is the community that is it's engine.

We have just finished celebrating Chanukah, the Festival of Lights. This is a time of rededication. A time to bring light unto darkness, to rise up in the face of adversity, and grow stronger together. I do not know what our community will look like in the future, but I am proud to a part of it.

Regards,
Avi D
Ex-Conference Chair for AppSecEU 2018

P.S. I am posting from this private account, instead of my regular @owasp.org address, since that account has coincidentally been blocked. I'm sure it's just an accidental glitch with unfortunate timing...
