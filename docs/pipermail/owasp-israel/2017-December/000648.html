Hi Everybody! 

 

The OWASP AppSec Israel conference last month was a huge success! Thank you
all for joining, and special thanks to everybody who supported us! 

 

We've received a lot of excellent feedback, and even a few items that we
need to work on for next year. We look forward to your help :) 

I hope everyone had a positive experience, and I would be happy to hear
about it (in addition to the feedback forms, which were sent to all those
who attended).

 

Over 600 people attended the conference, a great turnout! 

Additionally we had close to 350 developers attending our OWT Training Day,
and around 45 women joined our WIA (Women in AppSec) evening event.   

 

Most of the the presentations are online, and can be found directly in each
session on the agenda  (<A HREF="https://appsecil.org/Agenda">https://appsecil.org/Agenda</A>). For example, the
slides from Guy's excellent talk on Adversarial Machine Learning can be
found at
<A HREF="https://owaspappsecisrael2017.sched.com/event/CSDR/adversarial-machine-learn">https://owaspappsecisrael2017.sched.com/event/CSDR/adversarial-machine-learn</A>
ing-some-rules-can-be-bent-others-can-be-broken . The rest are available at
<A HREF="https://owaspappsecisrael2017.sched.com/">https://owaspappsecisrael2017.sched.com/</A> .

(If you notice a session missing the slides, please let us know and we will
ask the speaker to upload as soon as possible). 

 

Videos of all of the talks were also recorded, and these will also be
uploaded and available online shortly. 

 

If you have any other pictures, videos, etc of the conference - please send
me a link to them (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">avi.douglen at owasp.org</A> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">avi.douglen at owasp.org</A>&gt; ) to
share on the web page!

As was mentioned several times - we love feedback! We really want to hear

to be even more awesome. 

 

Our thanks go out to: 

-         All the sponsors that enabled us to make the most out of the
conference, without worrying about hunger, thirst, or caffeine deficiency. 

-         All the speakers, who made it all worthwhile!

-         Thanks also to all those who submitted a proposal for a talk - and
there were so many excellent proposals! Though we were unfortunately not
able to fit in all the talks this year, I hope we can entice you all to join
us at one of the next chapter meetings. I hope you all continue to
contribute, and that we'll be able to hear you next time! 

-         Thanks to all the volunteers who helped facilitate flow and
timing! 

-         Thanks to Sarah Manning and the rest of her Tikshoret.biz crew,
Yael Lampert and Tammy Wellins, without whom the Conference would have
descended into a steaming chaos of disorganized hellfire (as usually
happens). 

-         And many thanks to all the rest of the team and staff that helped
organize the event - Shiran Cohen, Ety Amram, Or Katz, Irene Abezgauz, Hemed
Gur Ary, Ofer Maor, Yossi Oren, Erez Metula, Keren Elazari, Shira Shamban,
and Tiffany Long!
