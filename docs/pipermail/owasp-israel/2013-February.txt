Hi everyone!

 

I think that we had a very successful meeting on Tuesday with so many people
participating I lost count.

 

I would like to thank Or Katz who organized the meeting so well, Shay Chen
and E&Y for hosting and the speakers and panel members: Itzik Kotler, Renana
Friedlich, Amichai Shulman, Ido Breger, Nimrod Luria, Ory Segal and Shlomo
Narkolayev. And lastly I would like to thank all the participants (local and
remote!). Your participation makes organizing such events worthwhile and
fun.

 

We plan to hold the next meeting in May or June: contact Avi Douglen
<mailto:douglen at hotmail.com>  if you want to host or speak. Join the mailing
list at https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel to make sure
you receive the invite.

 

The agenda with links to presentational  can be found here:
