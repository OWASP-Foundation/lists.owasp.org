<PRE>Dear all,

Eurocrypt 2018 is one of the flagship conference of the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research (www.iacr.org). It covers a wide 
range of topics in cryptology: theory of cryptography, new ciphers,
cryptanalysis of existing ciphers (breaking them), cryptographic 
protocols, electronic elections, cryptocurrencies (e.g., bitcoin), and 
more.

For the first time, this conference will be held in Israel - at Dan 
Panorama in Tel Aviv between 29th of April and the 3rd of May. The 
conference is organized by the Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security 
Research Center at the Technion.

This year (which is the 37th one), the 69 academic papers discussing 
cutting edge cryptographic research, will be accompanied by two invited 
talks (keynotes): Prof. Anne Cantaeut will present &quot;Desperately Seeking 
Sboxes&quot;, whereas Prof. Matthew Green will present &quot;Thirty Years of 
Digital Currency: From DigiCash to the Blockchain&quot;.

In addition, one evening is dedicated to &quot;fresh from the oven&quot; 
results - short presentations discussing results in the process of 
submission, or even not submitted yet! This session (rump session, 
Tuesday) is a great place to hear about exciting results (and enjoy a 
light atmosphere).

More information (including the program, registration, sponsors, etc.) can 
be found at <A HREF="https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2018.">https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2018.</A> Please note that early 
registration deadline ends on 15th of March.

And one final candy, on Sunday 29th (just before Eurocrypt starts), there 
will be an affiliated workshop discussing lightweight cryptography (e.g., 
cryptography for low-end devices, IoT, and similar environments). More 
information at <A HREF="http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/LWD/.">http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/LWD/.</A>

A poster of the conference is attached available at 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/Poster.pdf.">http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/Poster.pdf.</A> We will appreciate if you 
could help in more than just participating - tell colleagues, friends, 
neighbours, about the event! (on a different note, we still look for more 
sponsors to support attendance of students in the conference, so if you 
want to help an event taking place in Israel, please let us know).
