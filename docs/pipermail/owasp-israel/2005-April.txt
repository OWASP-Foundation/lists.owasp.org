Hi guys,

 

I've taken the role of renewing OWASP Israel activities. I'm shooting
for a 1st meeting in early June.

 

I'm currently working to spread the world about OWASP and its new
Israeli chapter. You will be surprised at how many (application)
security people know the OWASP top 10, but have never stopped to look at
what OWASP stands for. Once there is a set date and Agenda for a meeting
I'll be happy if you helped me spread the word about it.

 

You are more than welcome to offer suggestions regarding the OWASP
Israeli chapter activity,

 

~ Ofer
