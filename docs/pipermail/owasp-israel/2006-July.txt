Hi All,

Time of the next meeting of OWASP IL! The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP <http://www.owasp.org/> ) is an all-volunteer group that produces free, professional-quality, open-source documentation, tools, and standards. The OWASP community facilitates conferences, local chapters, articles, papers, and message forums. It is most known for the OWASP guide and the OWASP top 10, which are among the most important references regarding applications security. 

The meeting will be held on July  26th, 17:15, at Breach Security <http://www.breach.com>  offices, 11th Bareket St. Herzliya. Participation is free and open to all, but please inform us (mail me at ofers at breach.com) that you are coming so room is limited. 

Feel free to distribute information regarding this meeting to others in your organization or outside that you think may be interested in the meeting. You can also register to the OWASP Israel mailing list <http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel>  in order to receive updates regarding chapter's meetings. For further details please contact me. 

Program:

17:15 - Gathering, Socializing and Pizzas 

17:30 - Exposing cryptography for software developers 

Shai Zalalichin, Head of AppSec group, Comsec 

Encryption is a very important tool in the application security tool chest, but is also a very complex technology. The presentation will explore common pitfalls & countermeasures that every developer should follow when writing crypto-aware applications. 

The presentation was originally given at OWASP Europe conference in May. 

18:30 - Preventing Spoofing, Phishing and Spamming by Secure Usability and Cryptography 

Prof. Amir Herzberg, dept. of computer science, Bar-Ilan University, Israel 

Spoofing, Phishing and spamming are of the worst security problems in the Internet. Amir will present vulnerabilities in the current email and web systems, causing the proliferation of such attacks. Amir will then discuss some recent proposals made by him as well as others to improve security against these threats. Some solutions involve secure usability, some use (simple) cryptographic protocols, while others involve both areas. 

19:20 - Questions & Feedback

Shalom Ofer

My family and I are making Aliyah to Israel next month.  I have been
reading the Israel OWASP list for some time now and see it as a great
networking opportunity for me being an Oleh Chadash.

I would like to know if you know of any positions available for myself
in the information Security/Risk field.  I am very interested in
growing and helping to grow security services within Israel and abroad
and looking to speak to organizations that are interested in doing
this.

See attached CV for you to review.

Thanks in advance for you

David Lewis
