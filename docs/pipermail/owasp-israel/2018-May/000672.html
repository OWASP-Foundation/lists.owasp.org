<PRE>Hi Everyone! 

 

We will be having our fantastic yearly AppSecIL conference this year on September 5-6, 2018. 

This year we have a wonderful new venue in central Tel Aviv &#8211; Tel Aviv University. The Conference will be on Thursday, September 6th, and it will be preceded by a full day of free developer training on Wednesday the 5th. 

 

As you probably know, OWASP is a non-profit organization, and we have no corporate or financial backing. The AppSec Israel Conference is always free, as well as the Training Day. 

 

But we need your help to support it and keep it free, and allow us to reach as many people as possible! 

 

An AppSec Israel sponsor booth is also an excellent place to reach many of your target audience, with so many of our industry &#8211; security researchers, CISOs, appsec practitioners, security-aware developers &#8211; attending. This is the place to reach them all, whether you are wanting to sell your product or your service, or if you are just looking to recruit top talent. 

 

You can see more details and the available options here: <A HREF="https://2018.appsecil.org/assets/AppSecIL_2018_Sponsorships.pdf">https://2018.appsecil.org/assets/AppSecIL_2018_Sponsorships.pdf</A> 

This year we are keeping the existing prices mostly without change, and we also added a few interesting benefits and options! 

 

There is also an Early bird discount on the premium tiers, for anyone that signs by July 15th.  

If last year is any indication, the best ones will go fast ;-)  

 

Please be in touch with me directly via email (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">avi.douglen at owasp.org</A> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">avi.douglen at owasp.org</A>&gt; ) to finalize and reserve your place as soon as you can. 

 

Thank you!

OWASP Israel Board member and AppSecIL organizing committee

Subject: [OWASP Israel] SAVE THE DATE! OWASP's AppSec Israel 2018

 

Hi Everybody!

I am happy to announce that the annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will take place this year on Thursday, September 6th, 2018.
 
This year for the first ever, we will partner with Tel Aviv University to host the conference in the University facility.

As you all know, OWASP&#8217;s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants.
Last year over 650 people attended &#8211; don&#8217;t miss it this year!
The Conference will include multiple lecture tracks, and a sponsors display area for vendors of products and services relevant to Application Security.

We will open the Call for Presentations (CFP) and the Call for Training (CFT) soon, within the next few weeks &#8211; so start writing up your ideas!


We also want to continue the tradition that was started last year, to have another full day of Security Training just before the conference day. We are reaching out to you, AppSec community to help and support us for making it happen, we are looking for trainers and sponsors.   

The Training event will be conducted by professional security trainers, selected by OWASP, and free to attend.


We will also start a sponsorship drive soon, in the meantime, if you are interested in volunteering some time and effort, we could use your help!

Looking forward to seeing you all!

Or Katz

OWASP Israel Chair
