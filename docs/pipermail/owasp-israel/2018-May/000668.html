<PRE>Don&#8217;t forget to register for the DevSecCon conference next Monday in Tel Aviv! Details below. 

I hear they are having some amazing speakers&#8230; ;-) 

 

We will also be having an OWASP Israel Chapter meetup on Tuesday evening &#8211; over 180 have already registered to attend! 

There will be 2 talks at the meetup, in addition to plenty of time for networking and meeting the rest of the community: 

Pushing Left Like a Boss by Tanya Janca (who is also a Keynote Speaker at DevSecCon, as well as OWASP DevSlop project leader and OWASP Ottawa chapter leader). 

Crypto-mining: The New Force Behind Remote Code Execution Attacks by Gilad Yehudai and Natan Elul (both security researchers with Imperva, and both with advanced academic degrees). 

More details and registration here: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/249361818/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/249361818/</A> 

 

In addition, the CyberLadies group will be hosting a women-only event on Wednesday evening, featuring Tanya Janca (again!) as well as Michal Braverman-Blumenstyk (CTO of the Cloud and Security division at Microsoft). 

More details and registration here: <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/events/195752657900950/">https://www.facebook.com/events/195752657900950/</A> 

 

I hope to see you at some of these events! 

(But not at the CyberLadies group, I won&#8217;t be going to that since it is for women only :D )
