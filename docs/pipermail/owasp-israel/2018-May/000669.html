<PRE>Hi Everybody!
I am happy to announce that the annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will
take place this year on Thursday, September 6th, 2018.

This year for the first ever, we will partner with Tel Aviv University to
host the conference in the University facility.

As you all know, OWASP&#8217;s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants.
Last year over 650 people attended &#8211; don&#8217;t miss it this year!
The Conference will include multiple lecture tracks, and a sponsors display
area for vendors of products and services relevant to Application Security.

We will open the Call for Presentations (CFP) and the Call for Training
(CFT) soon, within the next few weeks &#8211; so start writing up your ideas!

We also want to continue the tradition that was started last year, to have
another full day of Security Training just before the conference day. We
are reaching out to you, AppSec community to help and support us for making
it happen, we are looking for trainers and sponsors.

The Training event will be conducted by professional security trainers,
selected by OWASP, and free to attend.

We will also start a sponsorship drive soon, in the meantime, if you are
interested in volunteering some time and effort, we could use your help!

Looking forward to seeing you all!

*Or Katz*
*OWASP Israel Chair*
