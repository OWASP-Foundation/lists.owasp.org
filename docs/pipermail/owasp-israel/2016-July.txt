as always. 

However, advance registration is required. Please register here:
https://appsecil2016.eventbrite.com/ 

 

 

Please note that our Call for Presentations (CFP) is still open! 

We are seeking presenters from the application security and developer
communities to discuss interesting topics related to the security of
applications, from the fields of web, mobile, cloud, etc. We want to ensure
fascinating lectures as every year, so please feel personally encouraged to
submit your talk ? even if you?ve never done this before! 

The content committee is committed to having a variety of speakers, so if
this is your first time presenting we will ensure that you have the support
needed to give a great talk. 

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2016_CFP Submission deadline
is July 30th. 

 

 

It is very important to us to keep the conference free, in order to reach as
many people as possible ? and we seem to be succeeding, we are expecting
well over 600 people this year. However, there are of course rising
expenses, as such we rely on the support of our sponsors to be able to put
on a fantastic conference. 

 

We are calling for Conference Sponsors!

 

It is also a great marketing opportunity (and excellent for recruiting). If
you work at a company or organization that is involved in any way with
application security ? as a vendor, a service provider, or as a consumer ?
we need your help! 

 

Details and prices are here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2016_Sponsorships 

This year we are also offering cost-effective sponsorship options that are a
good fit even for startups, government offices, and enterprises that are
?users? of application security.

 

 

Looking forward to seeing you all!

Hi, 

The OWASP Foundation is undergoing a rather big project, to reorganize the main website / wiki. Since many people use the website, in many different ways with different requirements, the organization is trying to collect as much information as possible. 

 

Everyone is invited to join this chat and share your perspective.

Hello Everyone, 

 

We now have the results of the Needs Assessment done by Sooryen (https://www.owasp.org/images/b/b2/OWASP_Needs_Assessment_Report.pdf). 

 

 The main takeaways of the report were:

*  Clean up our navigation and content strategy to increase usability and search capability.

*  Create a cleaner front page and select landing pages (such as the main Projects Page) so that people coming to our site can clearly figure out their next steps.

*  Improve the wiki aspect of our site so that it is easier to use.

*  Better integrate back end systems and communication.

*  Create a distinction between business/organization information and App Sec information.

Now we need your opinions on the matter.  To that end we will be hosting a Twitter and FB chat on July 25th where you can discuss your thoughts with Ram Ganesan, Gin Cheng from Sooryen as well as myself. Please share this information with your Chapters, Projects, Leaders, and fellow Members.  It is vital that we have as much participation as possible in this discussion. 

 

The Facebook chat will be hosted from 2 am PDT/9 am GMT to 8 am PDT/3 pm GMT on our FB Page <https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/ffe97632-8093-43fd-874e-367d6297da7e/facebook-com-open-web-application-security-project-296236753839074>  

 

The Twitter chat will be hosted form 8 am PDT/3 pm GMT to 9 am PDT/4 pm GMT.  The hashtag will be #OWASPChat

 

The Questions covered are:

1.     For the top level navigation, what do you think are the most relevant categories that should be included? 

2.     What are your thoughts on segregating the business and security information? 

3.     What are your thoughts on moving off of the MediaWiki platform? 

4.     What search engine would you recommend (elasticsearch)?

5.     What are your thoughts on the redesigns?

6.     What communications platforms or methods do you think we should adopt to better communicate with the community?

7.     Do you feel positive about moving forward with the site make over and improvements?

Subject: [OWASP Israel] OWASP AppSec Israel 2016 conference - REGISTRATION
OPENED

 

Hi Everybody!

 

As announced previously, the annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will take
place this year on Monday, September 19, 2016 ? just before all the stress
of the holidays sets in :D

 

The conference will be held in The College of Management (Michlala
l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion. 

Please note that we will be using different additional areas of the College,
so it will not be as crowded as last time :)

 

As you all know, OWASP?s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. 

Last year over 550 people attended ? don?t miss it this year! 

 

AppSec Israel 2016 will have two lecture tracks from an amazing group of
speakers. We will also host a sponsors pavilion for products and services
relevant to application security and developers. More details:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2016 

 

Thanks to our generous sponsors, attending the conference is free of charge,
as always. 

However, advance registration is required. Please register here:
https://appsecil2016.eventbrite.com/ 

 

 

It is very important to us to keep the conference free, in order to reach as
many people as possible ? and we seem to be succeeding, we are expecting
well over 600 people this year. However, there are of course rising
expenses, as such we rely on the support of our sponsors to be able to put

It is also a great marketing opportunity (and excellent for recruiting). If
