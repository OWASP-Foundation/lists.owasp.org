<PRE>Hello Everybody,

To start the new OWASP IL year, I would like to invite you to present a
lecture in one of the OWASP IL meetings this year. If you think that you
have something interesting to say about application security, OWASP IL
is the best place to present your lecture.

*** Please also mark in your diaries that OWASP IL next meeting will be
held on September 21st at 17:00, most probably in Comsec office in
Petach-Tikva. More details will follow ***

Some interesting subjects might be:
- New application security vulnerabilities
- Real world stories of app layer attacks or pen testing
- Solutions to the application security issue (but see the commercial
restriction below)
- Secure development &amp; secure development tools
- Security in specific environments such as dot net.

The OWASP charter prevents us from having commercially oriented lectures
in our meetings. As a presenter you would be allowed to name the company
you work for and use company slides.

So if you are interested please send me the title and a three line
summary of your lecture and I contact you to discuss it.

About OWASP &amp; OWASP IL
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an all-volunteer
group that produces free, professional-quality, open-source
documentation, tools, and standards. OWASP IL is the Israeli chapter of
OWASP. OWASP IL holds periodical meetings in which presentations are
given on topics such as application security vulnerabilities, testing,
solutions and events. 

Web Application Security is considered a very important issue in Israel,
as shown by the large number of Israeli vendors developing web
application security solutions, and we are sure that OWASP-Israel will
provide leading edge information to its participants and guests. 

Participation in OWASP-Israel meetings, mailing list and other
activities is free and open to all. Refer to
