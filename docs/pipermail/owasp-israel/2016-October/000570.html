Hi All, 

OWASP is soliciting training providers for the AppSecEU conference which will be held in Belfast 8th - 12th May 2017. <A HREF="https://2017.appsec.eu">https://2017.appsec.eu</A>

Topics

We are interested in all topics related to Web Application Security and OWASP, in particular, but not limited to (these are just examples):

*         Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, methods, processes, SDLC

*         Vulnerability analysis: code review, pentest, static analysis

*         Threat modelling

*         Mobile security

*         Cloud security

*         Browser security

*         HTML5 security

*         OWASP tools or projects in practice

*         New technologies, paradigms, tools

*         Privacy in web apps, Web services (REST, XML) and data storage

*         Operations and software security

*         Management topics in Application Security: Business Risks, Outsourcing/Offshoring, Awareness Programs, Project Management, Managing SDLC

Training should be of a practical nature, i.e. we will look favorably on a hands-on training. Also, please refrain from submitting marketing talks or including sales pitches within the training.

*         should promote training on all available media eg. Twitter, Linkedin

OWASP will provide the venue, marketing, registration logistics and basic wireless internet access. If you need additional technical arrangements, it is important to let us know.

OWASP will reserve up to two training slots at no cost and the trainer may reserve up to one slot at no cost. Please note that for data privacy reasons OWASP can&#8217;t provide trainers with contact information of the attendees.
