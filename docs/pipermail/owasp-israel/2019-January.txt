Subject: [OWASP Israel] OWASP Israel Meetup February 2019
Message-ID: <CAJRrLgFWy1rRxbJUBKBFfsZU2LdsJbJaUM-=nKk=13Uv+5Pf9w@mail.gmail.com>

Save the date! we will have our quarterly OWASP Israel meetup on Tuesday
February 12, in PerimeterX office in Tel Aviv, HaArba'a St 30.
Please make sure RSVP on meetup page -
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/258268457/

*Agenda:*
*17:00 - 17:30:* Gathering and Networking

*17:30 - 18:15:* "When Applications & Infrastructure Converge - A
Perspective on Istio, the Service Mesh Platform", Gadi Naor, Alcide CTO
In this session we will dive into Istio - the leading service mesh platform
- the security machinery it offers, and the role it plays in application
security, throughout the application delivery lifecycle.
We will also peek into how serverless and Istio co-exist.

*18:15 - 19:00:* "OWASP Serverless Top 10", Protego Labs
In moving to serverless, we shift some security responsibilities to the
infrastructure provider by eliminating the need to manage servers.
Unfortunately, that doesn?t mean we?re entirely absolved of all security
duties. Serverless functions still execute code and can still be vulnerable
to traditional application-level attacks. As a new type of architecture,
serverless presents new security challenges. Some are equal to traditional
application development, but some take a new form.

In this talk, I will examine how the original Top 10 stack up for
serverless apps based on the OWASP Serverless Top 10 project and why they
are different from traditional attacks in attack vectors and defense
techniques. I will also introduce the Damn Vulnerable Serverless
Application (DVSA), a deliberately vulnerable, open-source tool, aiming to
be an aid for both security professionals and developers to better
understand the implications and processes of serverless security.

*19:00 - 19:15:* Coffee Break

*19:15 - 20:00:* presentation TBD

See you there...
