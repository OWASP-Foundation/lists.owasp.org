David leads security-specific R&amp;D and industry collaboration, including security-specific partnerships and standards. Most recently, David founded BlackBerry&#8217;s Center for High Assurance Computing Excellence (CHACE) and co-founded DTsec, an industry cybersecurity assurance standard and evaluation program for connected medical devices that includes membership from FDA, NIH, DHS, NIST, and a variety of manufacturers and caregivers.  David is also heavily involved in security-specific evangelism, business development, and M&amp;A. David is a world-renowned expert with deep experience in operating systems, high assurance software development techniques, mobile device security and the Internet of Things (IoT).
