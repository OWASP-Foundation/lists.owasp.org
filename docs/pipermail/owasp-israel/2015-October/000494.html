Many thanks to our video sponsor, Checkmarx!

As was mentioned several times - we love feedback! We really want to hear
your perspective and experience, so that we can plan next year's conference
to be even more awesome. 

If you attended the conference, please take a few minutes RIGHT NOW to fill
in this online form (if you haven't already): <A HREF="http://goo.gl/forms/7QfFrnSi5u">http://goo.gl/forms/7QfFrnSi5u</A>


 

Your feedback on the conference is VERY important to us, to help us decide
which sessions to select for next year's conference. Please do give us as
much information as you can. 

(And no need to try to brute-force the form either, that is no challenge. So
please don't. ) 

 

Our thanks go out to: 

-         A special thanks to Dr. Yehuda Elmaliach and the College of
Management and staff, who graciously offered to host us this year. 

-         Thank you to all the sponsors that enabled us to make the most out
of the conference, without worrying about hunger, thirst, or caffeine
deficiency. 

-         Thanks to all the speakers, who made it all worthwhile - and, in
the words of several attendees, &quot;even better than the international
conferences like BlackHat and RSAC&quot; :)

-         A special thanks to our keynote speaker, Jeremiah Grossman, for
travelling all the way over to join us and share his vision with the crowd! 

-         Thanks also to all those who submitted a proposal for a talk - and
there were so many excellent proposals! Though we were unfortunately not
able to fit in all the talks this year, I hope we can entice you all to join
us at one of the next chapter meetings. I hope you all continue to
contribute, and that we'll be able to hear you next time! 

-         Thanks to all the volunteers who helped facilitate flow and timing
- Eitan Caspi, Ilya Chernyakov, Iris Levari, Elad Kirson, Boris
Chernilovsky, Moshe Zioni, Eliraz Broyer, Ofir Inbar, Anton Khitrenovich,
and anyone else I may have forgotten! 

-         And thanks to all the rest of the team and staff that helped
organize the event - Shiran Cohen, Ety Amram, Or Katz, Ofer Maor, Erez
Metula, and Hemed Gur Ary!  

 

See you all next year! 

 

Avi D 

Chairman, OWASP Israel 

 

P.S. Don't forget the feedback. <A HREF="http://goo.gl/forms/7QfFrnSi5u">http://goo.gl/forms/7QfFrnSi5u</A>
