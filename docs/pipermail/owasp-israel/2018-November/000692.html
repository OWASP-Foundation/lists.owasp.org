<PRE>Hi All,
We will have our quarterly OWASP Israel meetup in Synopsys office in
Herzliya (Maskit St 8) on November 20th.
For more details and registration -
<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/255823857/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/255823857/</A>

The agenda for the meetup:
17:30 - 18:00: Gathering and Networking

18:00 - 18:45: &#8220;Scratching the Surface of your CD?&#8221; Ofer Maor, Director,
Solutions Management, Synopsys
Continuous Delivery (CD) introduces a new set of challenges for application
security testing, even compared with already fast Continuous Integration
(CI) and DevOps methodologies. CD development organization can produce
hundreds or even thousands of software updates per day, some of them taking
no longer than a few hours from beginning to end.
True continuous testing calls for true, inline, continuous security
testing, which does not rely on any dedicated testing slots. In this talk
we will talk about some of these concepts - how to streamline security
testing in the background, how to fit it into modern A/B testing cycles,
and how to build an approval process that fits a modern CD workflow, rather
than an old security go/no-go approach.

18:45 - 19:30: &quot;Client JavaScript Security - an Oxymoron?&quot; Hadar Blutrich,
Source Defense co-founder
Your firewall, WAF, source code review, and many other security solutions
are focused on your internal servers and their communication with your
customer 's browser. 3rd party scripts are hosted on remote servers which
are completely outside of your security system's reach and executed on the
customer 's browser over which you have no control. Thus, after every layer
of your corporate security program has already done its job, the user 's
browser is communicating with these remote servers. This means that you
have no visibility, management, or control over the behaviors and actions
of each 3rd party. Source Defense will discuss preventing JavaScript from
accessing data that the JavaScript was not intended to access.

We are working on adding another presentation to the agenda and will update
once we have more details.

Thanks,

Or Katz
OWASP Israel Chair
