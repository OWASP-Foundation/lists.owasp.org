<PRE>GE's new digital health initiative in Acute Care is one of two targets on which GE and Roche Diagnostics have recently partnered. The leader in in-vivo diagnostics (GEHC) and the leader in in-vitro diagnostics (Roche) expect to make tremendous progress in the management of cancer and sepsis. Sepsis is a major challenge in medicine. Its incidence is increasing so significantly, that it is now considered an epidemic, with 250,000 deaths from sepsis per year, and approximately $19 billion of healthcare costs in the US alone.
With the Acute Care initiative, we have undertaken the challenge to reduce the incidence and costs associated with sepsis as a first target for a new digital health offering that is based in real-time sensing, biological markers, and data science. The Acute Care Data Science team in Haifa is developing novel AI and machine learning predictive and prescriptive solutions for medical practitioners using this rich and untapped medical data.
We are seeking candidates to join the Acute Care team, to develop and design innovative cyber security solutions for unique and complex technologies. The ideal candidate will demonstrate a thorough understanding of Cyber Security attack techniques and mitigation in the application level and infrastructure level.
Responsibilities:
* Application security reviews
* Review of third-party services (e.g. SaaS-providers)
* Audit, assessment, and penetration testing techniques
* Projects and research work as needed
* Security training and outreach to internal development teams
* Security guidance documentation
* Security tool development
* Security metrics delivery and improvements
Requirements -
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related field
* Minimum of 5 years of experience with any combination of the following: threat modeling experience, secure coding, identity management and authentication, software development, cryptography, system administration and network security.
* 5+ years of working knowledge and understanding of security engineering, system and network security, authentication and security protocols, cryptography, or application security
* An understanding of web services
* A team player. Collaborative and communicative. Able to adapt to change.
