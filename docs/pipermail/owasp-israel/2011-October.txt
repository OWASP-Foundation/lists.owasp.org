*Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces*

 [image: logo] <http://www.usenix.org/events/sec11/>

*Abstract: *Modern automobiles are pervasively computerized, and hence
potentially vulnerable to attack. However, while previous research has shown
that the internal networks within some modern cars are insecure, the
associated threat model ? requiring prior physical access ? has justifiably
been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an open question if automobiles
can also be susceptible to remote compromise. Our work seeks to put this
question to rest by systematically analyzing the external attack surface of
a modern automobile. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible via a
broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics tools, CD players,
Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications
channels allow long distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin
audio exfiltration and theft. Finally, we discuss the structural
characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to such problems
and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them.

*Speaker Bio*: *Stephen Checkoway is a PhD student at UC San Diego. His
primary research interests are in systems security and voting?particularly
in voting security and post-election auditing. Beyond those, he is
interested in a number of topics such as tech policy?particularly 4th
amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures as it
relates to computers?modern algebra, category theory, cryptography,
programming languages, compilers. *
