Hi Everybody! 

 

The OWASP AppSec Israel conference on Tuesday was a huge success - well over
450 people attended! 

Thanks to everybody who participated and supported us! 

 

The presentations are not yet online, but we are collecting them and will
upload them as soon as we can. They will be available at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2014_Presentations within a
few days. Videos of most of the talks were also recorded, thanks to
Checkmarx, and these will also be uploaded and available online shortly. 

 

If you have any pictures, videos, etc of the conference - please send a link
to them, to Ofer Shezaf (ofer at shezaf.com <mailto:ofer at shezaf.com> ) to share
on the web page. 

 

Some numbers about the Conference: 

-         Well over 450 attended (out of 680 registered). For context, this
was bigger than AppSecEU! 

-         10 Sponsors - 2 Platinum, 4 Gold, and 4 Silver. 

-         8 Booths

-         12 Track sessions (in 2 auditoriums)

-         1 Opening Keynote + 1 Closing Session

-         16 Speakers 

-         3 coffee breaks and one lunch :) 

 

As was mentioned several times - we love feedback! We really want to hear
your perspective and experience, so that we can plan next year's conference
to be even more awesome. 

If you attended the conference, please take a few minutes RIGHT NOW to fill
in this online form (if you haven't already):
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SNS0pSiyRaqSq4nTfkH8HFiUsgPb9qTHRHlOx7Y0RRg
/viewform 

(If you did already write/email your feedback, no need to repeat it).

 

Your feedback on the conference is VERY important to us, to help us decide
which sessions to select for next year's conference. Please do give us as
much information as you can. (And no need to try to brute-force the form
either, that is no challenge. So please don't. ) 

 

This year we are trying to collect some additional information about you,
for statistics and better targeting. 

YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILL OUT THESE FIELDS, but it is helpful if you
choose to do so. 

 

Our thanks go out to: 

-         A special thanks to Dr. Anat Bremler and the IDC, who graciously
host us every year. 

-         Thank you to all the sponsors that enabled us to make the most out
of the conference, without worrying about hunger, thirst, or caffeine
deficiency. 

-         Thanks to all the speakers, who made it all worthwhile - and, in
the words of several attendees, "even better than the international
conferences like BlackHat and RSAC" :) 

-         Thanks also to all those who submitted a proposal for a talk - and
there were so many excellent proposals! But unfortunately we were not able
to fit in all the talks this year. I hope you all continue to contribute,
and that we'll be able to hear you next time! 

-         And thanks to all the staff that helped organize the event - Ilil,
Or, Ory, Itzik, Ofer and Ofer! 

 

See you all next year! 

 

Avi D 

Chairman, OWASP Israel
