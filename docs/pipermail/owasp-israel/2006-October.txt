Hi all,
the new OWASP Testing Project is started!

We want to review the old OWASP Testing Project and create the OWASP
Testing Guide v2 by the end of the year.

The Testing guide originated in 2003. Dan Cuthbert was one of the
original editors. It was handed over to Eoin Keary in 2005 and
transformed into a wiki. Being a wiki it is easier for more to
contribute and should keep up-to-date easier. Matteo Meucci has
decided to take on the Testing guide (which is not a trivial feat) and
update it.

Problem to be Addressed:
Many additional sections should be updated and reviewed. Also
additional areas of  discovery should be addressed. the guide
currently covers alot but could cover much more.

Benefit to OWASP Members and Community:
A reference to the testing community that is updated by the community.
Should provide many of the answers one would look for when testing an
application for security.

Goals and Deliverables:
The guide to be updated with a defined list pf topics and the current
guide reviewed. the list of additional topics has been agreed with the
AoC.
A revised and updated Testing Guide which shall be more extensive than
ever before.

**************************** Phase I: Call for participation
*****************************************
Work is underway on the 1st phase of the testing guide v2, and we
would love to hear from volunteers who could offer their knowledge in
creating this phase. If you have knowledge and experience in
application testing, and can spare a few hours a week, please contact
me and subscribe to our ml.

Firstly we have to discuss about the new index of the guide (deadline
15th October):
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Tes
ting_Guide_-_Index

Then write down the new paragraphs. We would like to collect the first
documentations by 5th November.

Raphael,

One comment though... this mailing list is in English (I don't recall a
Hebrew posting), so it may be a good idea to post in both Hebrew and
English, and/or to include a PDF or a link to a Hebrew page somewhere.

My two cents.

Hi Guys,

I asked Raphael to publish on the list only stories for that are
specifically relevant to application security. Such stories, when directly
relevant, can benefit all of us.
