<PRE>This year, in addition to the exciting AppSec Israel conference we are once
again organising a full day of training.

The Training Day will take place on Wednesday, September 5th, 2018 &#8211; right
before the AppSec Israel Conference in the same location (Tel Aviv
University) and will be free to attend.

The training will be mostly aimed at developers and newcomers to
application security but also at those with slightly more experience with
the goal of improving the security of all software and growing the pool of
skilled professionals in the field.

We are now calling for pro-bono trainers who are willing to support the
Israeli AppSec community and submit proposals to deliver this training. The
format has changed slightly this year and we are looking for multiple
trainers to volunteer to deliver, hands-on, workshop-style training in
English lasting between 1.5 and 3 hours although we would also be
interested in proposals for a full day of training.. The training will
remain single track. We are also intending to provide travel assistance
this year if necessary.

Topics we are interesting in seeing in proposals include:
*    Workshops on common (OWASP Top 10 2017) attacks and their mitigations

*    Secure development with modern paradigms such as Single Page
Applications and WebSockets.
*    General application security mechanisms
*    Secure coding guidelines

Please submit your proposal here:
&lt;<A HREF="https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/91874/owasp-global-training-tour-tel-aviv-israel-rishon-10-17-2017">https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/91874/owasp-global-training-tour-tel-aviv-israel-rishon-10-17-2017</A>&gt;
<A HREF="https://www.papercall.io/appsecisrael2018training">https://www.papercall.io/appsecisrael2018training</A>

The CFT closes at 23:59 (GMT+3) on 25th July 2018.

Acceptance notifications should start from 8th August 2018.

The CFT team will select the training based on content, quality of
submission, and expertise of trainer(s), and are completely independent of
any vendor or sponsor support.

However, preference will be given to submissions which:

*    Make use of OWASP projects as part of the workshops

*    Provide content and exercises which the attendees can take home with
them

*    Refer to modern technologies such as (but not limited to) node.js, Go,
Python, Scala

*    Have a strong interactive and hands-on focus.

Benefits for trainers:

*    Trainers will be invited to take part in the speaker&#8217;s dinner after
the conference itself

*    Training slides can be branded with the trainer&#8217;s company (but must
not be focused on the company&#8217;s products)

*    Trainers are welcome to give out swag during their sessions


Please forward this information to relevant people or companies who might
be interested in delivering this high-impact training.
