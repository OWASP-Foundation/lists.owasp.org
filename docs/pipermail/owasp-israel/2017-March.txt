Message-ID: <CAHxDhRQ5_Ao9=qo9knHHv94PzmmE2q6bTpAAufo4H=3-ajdqiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I wanted to share with you exciting news of my newly published book: Essential
Node.js Security <https://leanpub.com/nodejssecurity>.

Its audience is Node.js developers, and equipping them with secure code
methodologies, and common best practices in the Node.js ecosystem.

The book features many of OWASP security risks among the top 10
vulnerabilities and is fluent with practical source code examples, as well
as covering quite a few OWASP resources through-out.


I invite you to get a free copy of the book at http://leanpub.com/
nodejssecurity/c/OWASPIL.
I'll appreciate any feedback, and comments you may have.



On a personal note, I'm actively contributing to OWASP NodeGoat project,
and generally active around open source and Node.js security including my
talk on this topic in our previous OWASP AppSec 2016 conference.

So if anyone would like to connect and share more ideas I'll be happy to
meet you :)

This meeting will be hosted by Checkmarx, in the Amot Atrium Tower at 2 Jabotinsky St., Ramat Gan (right across from the Boursa).  

11th floor. 

 

We are currently working on setting up the agenda, and still have some slots available ? if you would like to propose a talk, please let me know ASAP! 

 

Please note that as usual, registration is required ? sign up here if you are planning to attend:

If you are not yet a member of the Meetup group, you will need to join (for free of course :) )

Nobody will be turned away, however space is limited so please only register if you will be attending, otherwise it is very difficult for us to plan (and bring the right amount of food :) )

 

Hope to see you all there!
