Subject: [OWASP Israel] SPAM on our List
Message-ID: <SNT140-ds196D3BFA631DF3A2306D32B1F60@phx.gbl>

Esteemed list members,

 

Contrary to the possible opinion that we believe certain time pieces to be a
beneficial announcement to the community, it seems our list has again been
the victim of some spam. 

 

While we do have strict controls on our mailing list, in this case it seems
to have bypassed those controls, apparently as a result of a
misconfiguration of the spam filter. As our mailing list is managed together
with the global lists, it is out of our direct control, however I will be
looking into the cause, and find out how this can be prevented in the
future. I will endeavor to share any additional relevant details I find out.


 

In the meantime, we apologize for the unpleasantness, and congratulate
anyone that does decide to buy a watch. 

 

Cheers,

Avi D

OWASP IL Board Member
