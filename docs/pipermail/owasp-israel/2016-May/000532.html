*Agenda:&#8239;*



*17:00 &#8211; Gathering, Food &amp; drinks*



*17:30 &#8211; Opening Note *





*17:45 &#8211; Insiders &#8211; The Threat is Already Within*

*Sagie Dulce:, Shiri Margel, Imperva*

*In recent years, we have witnessed a growing number of enterprises and
government agencies suffer data breaches. While organizations are buffing
up their security layers&#8212;which is important&#8212;most of the focus is on
preventing direct threats that come from outside, while detecting threats
from within is neglected. *



*In this talk we will present our research data. Our data shows that
insider threats, weather attributed to malicious, negligent or compromised
insider, go unnoticed by common security tools. In order to detect insider
attacks we suggest a mixture of Behavior Analytics and Deception
technology. These technologies were deployed in several production
environments. We then collected data from these environments and discovered
different forms of insider threats in each and every deployment. Our data
suggests that organizations are already experiencing some form of insider
attack which current security technology does not address *





*18:30 &#8211; 1Password protects you, but how protects 1Password ?*

*Adi Ludmer, Perimiterx*



*1Password is one of the most popular Password managers in the world.*

*The most important quality for tools in this category is the level of
trust that they provide us when we let them guard our most sensitive data.*


*In this talk we will explain (and demonstrate) several flaws in the design
of 1Password&#8217;s architecture, that could potentially be exploited and put
our sensitive data which is stored there at risk.We will also explain
several flaws which have already been disclosed, and give some
recommendations for how to use Password managers in a safer way. *



*19:15 &#8211; Coffee break *



*19:30 &#8211; Proxy based assertion*

*Erez Kalman, Amdocs*



*Secure method of using a single proxy entry point to pass assertion data
for user authentication and authorization using the headers to other
systems *
