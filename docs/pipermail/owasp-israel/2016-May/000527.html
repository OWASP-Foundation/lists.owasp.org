<PRE>Hi Everybody! 

 

Our next chapter meeting will take place on Tuesday, June 14, 2016. 

 

The meeting will be hosted by Amdocs, at their office at 8 Hapnina St.,
Raanana. 

As always, attendance is free but we do need you to register in advance -
please RSVP here: <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/229662688/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/229662688/</A> (you
will need to join the OWASP Israel meetup group, if you haven't yet). 

 

We are still working on the agenda, and will publish it as soon as it is
completed. 

 

On that note - we still need more speakers for this upcoming meeting. We are
always looking for more speakers! 

If you have an interesting talk to share on application security or other
OWASP topics - we want to hear from you! Even if it doesn't work for this
meeting, we are always happy to schedule your talk for the next one. 

 

If you want to present a talk - please send an email to Erez Metula
(<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">erezmetula at appsec-labs.com</A> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-israel">erezmetula at appsec-labs.com</A>&gt; ) with your
details, a short bio, the presentation's title and abstract, and any other
important information. 

 

We hope to finalize the talk selection by May 15th, so please send your
proposal as soon as you can! Or send it now and save a slot for next
meeting. 

 

Cheers! 

Avi D
