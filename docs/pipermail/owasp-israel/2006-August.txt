Hi all

 

Reading the OWASP PHP Top article I noticed the following - it is
recommended to disable magic_quotes_gpc as one of the steps of protection
against the SQL injection attack.

 

I was wondering why this PHP automatic quoting method is no longer
recommended.

Can you point me to any of the vulnerability in it?

 

Thanks

Hi,

It is advised to turn the automatic magic_quotes_gpc off from a couple
of reasons:

*	It only escapes GET, POST & Cookies (i.e. only handles HTTP
traffic)
*	It does not handle numeric fields
*	It is vulnerable to second order SQL Injections
*	It cannot be set at runtime
*	It hurts performance
*	It gives you a wrong sense of security !!!

 

It is preferred to escape the data at runtime.

 

Hope it helps,

Erez.
