Hi All,

 

We are planning to have another OWASP meeting before the summer. We haven't
scheduled the date yet - we're planning it for the end of May - but we are
looking your help with:

 

-        Location: We estimate that around 50-80 participants will be
joining, so we need a company that can host this amount of people in one
room (the meeting will start around 17:00 and will finish around 20:00).

 

-        Presentations: We are looking for experts to present their research
on application security.

 

Please send me an email if you can help.

 

Thanks!

 

Avi Douglen

OWASP IL Board Member
