39, Tel Aviv-Yafo* on *May 8th 18:00*.
As always, attendance is free but we do need you to register in advance in
the meet-up page -

The DevSecCon conference <https://www.devseccon.com/tel-aviv-2018/> will be
held in Tel-Aviv on the meet-up week and we will host international guests
therefore the presentation will be in English.

Agenda for the meet-up:
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/249361818/

*Title: Pushing Left Like a Boss*
*Abstract:*
With incident response and penetration testing currently receiving most of
our application security dollars, it would appear that industry has decided
to treat the symptom instead of the disease.  ?Pushing left? refers to
starting security earlier in the SDLC; addressing the problem throughout
the process.  From scanning your code with a vulnerability scanner to red
team exercises, developer education programs and bug bounties, this talk
will show you how to ?push left', like a boss.


*Tanya Janca - Bio:*Tanya Janca is a senior cloud advocate for Microsoft,
specializing in application security; evangelizing software security and
advocating for developers through public speaking, her open source project
OWASP DevSlop, and various forms of teaching via workshops, blogs and
community events.  As an ethical hacker, OWASP Project and Chapter Leader,
software developer, effective altruist and professional computer geek of
20+ years, she is a person who is truly fascinated by the ?science? of
computer science.


*Title: Crypto-mining: The New Force Behind Remote Code Execution Attacks*

*Abstract:*Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks involving crypto-mining are
gaining momentum. They've become attackers' new favorite way to exploit
vulnerabilities in web application source code and are prevalent in over
88% of all RCE attacks. In this talk we will investigate the methods
attackers are using to infect with crypto-mining malwares, specifically how
they exploit RCE and insecure deserialization vulnerabilities in order to
launch their attacks. We will analyze malicious crypto-mining scripts and
see how the attackers make money by tracing their actual crypto wallets and
mining pools. We will also explain why although there is a surge in crypto
mining attacks, we have not seen any Bitcoin mining, only mining of other
crypto currencies.

*Gilad Yehudai - Bio:*
Gilad Yehudai is an algorithm developer and security researcher within
Imperva?s research group. Gilad develops algorithms and solutions using
machine learning algorithms, and also researches new security threats and
vulnerabilities. Gilad holds both a bachelor?s degree and a master?s degree
in mathematics from Tel Aviv University.


*Natan Elul - Bio:*Natan Elul is a security researcher within Imperva?s
research group. Natan researches new security threats and vulnerabilities
and develops research infrastructures for vulnerability assessment and
malware analysis. Natan holds both a bachelor?s degree and a master?s
degree in Computer Science from Ben Gurion University.

Subject: [OWASP Israel]  DevSecOps Meetup
Message-ID: <C0AF48DC-4F1A-4392-86BC-FB940B5E2B5B@soluto.com>

Hey All
I would like to invite you to our DevSecOps meetup, hosted by Soluto.
I?ll introduce Glue, a tool developed by OWASP that ease the integration of security tools into the CI - including live demo. The tool has built in capabilities for filtering (for example, handling false positives) and reporting (for example to Jira or TeamCity).
Danny from Snyk will share details and insights from their research into open source security and demonstrate how it is possible to automatically identify and track publicly known vulnerabilities from the CVE database, source code hosted on GitHub, and various other interesting sources.

The talks will be recorded, and we?re working on live streaming from our Twitter account - @SolutoEng.

Looking forward to see you all!

Omer
