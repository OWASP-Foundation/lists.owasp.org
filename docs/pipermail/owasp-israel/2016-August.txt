OPENED

 

(????? ????)

Hi Everybody!

 

As announced previously, the annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will take
place this year on Monday, September 19, 2016 ? just before all the stress
of the holidays sets in :D

 

The conference will be held in The College of Management (Michlala
l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion. 

Please note that we will be using different additional areas of the College,
so it will not be as crowded as last time :)

 

As you all know, OWASP?s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. 

Last year over 550 people attended ? don?t miss it this year! 

 

AppSec Israel 2016 will have two lecture tracks from an amazing group of
speakers. We will also host a sponsors pavilion for products and services
relevant to application security and developers. More details:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2016 

 

Thanks to our generous sponsors, attending the conference is free of charge,
as always. 

However, advance registration is required. Please register here:
https://appsecil2016.eventbrite.com/ 

 

 

It is very important to us to keep the conference free, in order to reach as
many people as possible ? and we seem to be succeeding, we are expecting
well over 600 people this year. However, there are of course rising
expenses, as such we rely on the support of our sponsors to be able to put
on a fantastic conference. 

 

We are calling for Conference Sponsors!

 

It is also a great marketing opportunity (and excellent for recruiting). If
you work at a company or organization that is involved in any way with
application security ? as a vendor, a service provider, or as a consumer ?
we need your help! 

 

Details and prices are here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2016_Sponsorships 

This year we are also offering cost-effective sponsorship options that are a
good fit even for startups, government offices, and enterprises that are
?users? of application security.

 

 

Looking forward to seeing you all!

The conference will be held in The College of Management (Michlala l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion. 

Please note that we will be using different additional areas of the College, so it will not be as crowded as last time :)

 

As you all know, OWASP?s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants. 

Last year over 550 people attended ? don?t miss it this year! 

 

AppSec Israel 2016 will have two lecture tracks from an amazing group of speakers. We will also host a sponsors pavilion for products and services relevant to application security and developers. More details: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2016 

 

Thanks to our generous sponsors, attending the conference is free of charge, as always. 

However, advance registration is required. Please register here: https://appsecil2016.eventbrite.com/ 

 

 

It is very important to us to keep the conference free, in order to reach as many people as possible ? and we seem to be succeeding, we are expecting well over 600 people this year. However, there are of course rising expenses, as such we rely on the support of our sponsors to be able to put on a fantastic conference. 

 

We are calling for Conference Sponsors!

 

It is also a great marketing opportunity (and excellent for recruiting). If you work at a company or organization that is involved in any way with application security ? as a vendor, a service provider, or as a consumer ? we need your help! 

 

Details and prices are here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Israel_2016_Sponsorships 

This year we are also offering cost-effective sponsorship options that are a good fit even for startups, government offices, and enterprises that are ?users? of application security.

 

 

Looking forward to seeing you all!
