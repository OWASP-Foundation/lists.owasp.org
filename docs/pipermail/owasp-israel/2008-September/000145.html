<PRE> 

Dear All,

 

Thanks again for participating in OWASP AppSec Israel 2008 Conference.

We hope you have enjoyed the lectures and would like to ask for a quick
moment of your time to help us.

Filling this feedback form is your little contribution to the community -
and can help us decide which speakers to bring again. 

We really appreciate your help. 

 

You can fill this form by simply replying to the email, and grading between
1 (worst) and 5 (best) each of the fields for each lecture you have attended
(just leave the rest empty or erase them). Your voting is guaranteed to
remain anonymous (Speakers will only receive a summary of the results).

 

Note: If you have already submitted a printed form in the conference -
please do not fill again for that lecture 

(We have no way of telling which ones would be double)

 

Thanks,

OWASP Israel 2008 Steering Committee.
