Cloudy with a chance of WAF

Or Katz, Principal Security Researcher, Akamai Technologies

 

Web application firewalls are a critical tool to those seeking to protect
their web applications - it is the first line of defense that virtually
shields modern web applications from the malicious actions of web hackers. 5
years ago a typical web application firewall was an on-premise solution,
which was deployed and maintained by web application owners. Nowadays, as
more and more applications are migrated to the cloud, we are also witnessing
the cloudification of Web Application Firewalls. 

In this presentation I will discuss the non-obvious benefits and advantages
of cloud-based WAFs, for example - the ability to correlate web application
firewall events across numerous applications around the internet, detecting
widely distributed attack campaigns that in some cases go unnoticed and in
other cases may use zero day exploits that could not be detected otherwise,
etc.

 

 

-          18:30 ? 19:15

The Security of SSL

Itsik Mantin, WAF Architect and Researcher, F5 Networks

 

Over last few years, a number of attacks have been discovered in the
Transport Layer Security protocol.

The BEAST, TIME, BREACH and Lucky13 attacks were able to break the SSL
protocol and extract data protected by SSL such as session cookies. 

In the presentation I will discuss the details of these attacks from a
cryptographic perspective, and in particular how does it happen that
state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms suffer from a relatively large
number of vulnerabilities.

 

 

-          19:15 ? 19:30 

Coffee break

 

-          19:30 ? 20:15 

An Arms Race: Using Banking Trojan and Exploit Kit Tactics for Defense

Ziv Mador, Director of Security Research, SpiderLabs (Trustwave)

 

During this talk we will show how security products can use hackers'
advanced obfuscation tactics for their own defensive code. Once the malware
is ?improved? to overcome that obfuscation we will demonstrate how to back
deploy these hacker tricks to a security product Proof Of Concept to better
block exploit kits and other similar web based threats. 

(Note that this is a repeat of the talk Ryan Barnett and Ziv gave at the RSA
conference several weeks ago:
http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us14/agenda/sessions/1056/an-arms-race-u
sing-banking-trojan-and-exploit-kit. More details about it are included in
the blog they posted after their talk:
