<PRE>Hi Everybody,

This is a reminder that we at breach host the next meeting of the
Israeli ISSA chapter and since I'm going to be one of the speakers, it
is certainly going to have a lot about application security, so you
might be interested also. Please find the time to notify me if you are
coming, it is important for our preparations.

~ Ofer

Targeted attacks against web sites: would it happen to you? See for
yourself.

Ofer Shezaf, CTO, Breach Security

In recent years computer hacking has changed dramatically. Hacking is
not just for scripts kiddies that use scripts downloaded from the
Internet anymore. The most dangerous hacking is done for financial or
political gain, by organized crime, governments and terrorists. The main
difference is that modern cyber crime is targeted, effective and much
less visible.

 

The presentation will:

o               Explain the unique aspects of those targeted attacks, 

o               Bring examples of such targeted attacks from the world,

o               Include a demonstration of a targeted attack

o               Analyze whether your organization is the target of such
attacks. 

o               And lastly, discuss possible solutions.

 

19:00

Going out for drinks (for the brave ones)
