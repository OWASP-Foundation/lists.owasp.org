Dear OWASPers,

 

As in every year, OWASP AppSec Israel is the best, biggest, and most
interesting conference in Israel for Application Security. This year we are
expecting well over 500 attendees, including security professionals,
developers, managers, and more.. 

 

Whether you have a product to showcase, or you are recruiting, sponsoring
the OWASP AppSec Israel event gets you the right exposure. It also helps the
OWASP community, and ensures that we can keep up doing better and better
conferences. 

 

Some important updates:

-           In case you haven't noticed - the conference this year is moving
to a new location, to help fit our over growing community. The event will
take place in the Michlala Le'Minhal in Rishon LeZion. More details on the
website. 

 

-           Last year we changed the sponsorship tiers, and we are now
offering Silver, Gold and Platinum sponsorship levels. There is also a
cost-effective "Community Supporter" option for non-profits, government
offices, small startups, and such. 

For more details on the available sponsorship options please see:
