Do you want to define the future of Privacy?
A new ground-breaking startup, currently in stealth mode, is looking for a
Lead Cryptographic Researcher. If you are an experienced cryptographer,
with theoretical and practical experience, and the passion to do good, your
place is with us.
We are using cryptography to solve some of the toughest problems around
identity and privacy, dealing with the challenges brought on the heels of
the Equifax data breach, Cambridge Analytica, GDPR, and the consumer right
to her own data.

Required skills:
? Multi-party computation
? Cryptographic primitives and protocol design
? Protocol analysis under various adversarial models
? Taking into account computation, communication, and time limitations
? Understanding security, privacy, and the tradeoffs between them
? Able to communicate and work with theoretical and development
