<PRE>The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference is the largest conference in
Israel for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of
participants. Over 650 people attended last year!

Whether you have a product to showcase, offering a service, or you are
recruiting, sponsoring the OWASP AppSec Israel event gets you the right
exposure. This year we are expecting well over 700 attendees, including
security professionals, developers, managers, and more. The conference will
take place this year on Wednesday, October 18th, 2017, at The College of
Management (Michlala l&#8217;Minhal), in Rishon LeZion &#8211; just south of Tel Aviv.

In addition, we will be hosting a free Training Day, part of the OWASP
World Tour, on October 17th, 2017. This will provide developers with the
basic skills they need to build secure systems.

Sponsoring the AppSecIL Conference also helps support the OWASP community,
and ensures that we can keep on making our conferences better and better.
Sponsorship fees are intended to cover the costs of the Conference. Since
the Conference is open to all and free of charge to attend, we need your
support to enable us to put on a great conference.

*Past sponsors include Intuit, SafeBreach, GE Digital, Akamai, Imperva,
Checkmarx, Synopsys, Ben Gurion University, LivePerson, and many others*.

OWASP is an open source, non-profit organization. While our activities are
free for all, we do have costs, and need your help to make our activities
better.

We are now offering Silver, Gold and Platinum sponsorship levels. There is
also a cost-effective &#8220;Community Supporter&#8221; option for non-profits,
government offices, small startups, and such. Of course, if you are a
Corporate Member of OWASP (at any level) and allocate a percentage (20-40%)
of your membership fees to the Israel Chapter, we consider those funds as
conference sponsorship accordingly.

*Early bird sponsors that sign a contract by September 1st will get a 10%
discount. *
