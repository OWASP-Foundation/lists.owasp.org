Hey,
I thought that it will be helpful to create a group of all the Israelis that are going to the conference. This is could be useful for a lot of things: Going to talks together, sharing a talk you are speaking at, meeting for a launch or going for a beer, helping each other etc. So, if you are going to the conference, write down your mail here<https://goo.gl/forms/MLtkZyWjHUTrSP0m1> with the preferred communication method. I?ll update all the responders in mail about the chosen communication method at the end of next week.

See you there!
Omer
