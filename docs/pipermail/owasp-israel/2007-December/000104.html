<PRE>Sorry for yet another post, but the link I provided had a typo: correct link
is <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2007_Conference">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2007_Conference</A>

 

Thanks

Hi All,

 

Thanks for attending the OWASP Israel 2007, the 1st official OWASP
conference held in Israel. With 8 wonderful talks and around 200 people I
had a great time. I always love meeting you guys, and I hope you also
enjoyed the event as much as I did. In order for send you information about
future OWASP meetings and activities I am enrolling those of you not already
on the list to the OWASP IL mailing list. This is a VERY low volume list
that includes mostly information about our meetings. If you really don't
want to be on the list, or are already subscribed using a different e-mail
address, let me know and I will remove you.

 

Few of the presentations given in the conference are already online on the
conference page at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2007_Conferenc.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2007_Conferenc.</A> I hope to get
the rest in a few days and I will e-mail the mailing list once I get them.

 

I would appreciate your comments, feedback and ideas on how to improve next
time as well as feedback to our presenters. Can you assign a grade between 1
to 5 to each of the presentations and add any written comment you have. I
will provide the speakers with your feedback without disclosing the source.
