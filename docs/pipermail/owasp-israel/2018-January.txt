hi there,

so yes, I assume most of you on this list are regular Open Source
contributors, but I also assume you have a lot of co-workers who are not.
This is an opportunity to get them involved.

On  January 24th I am running a workshop in which I am helping people get
through their first Open Source contribution. This is a language
independent event. We don't even require people to know how to program.
There are plenty of things people can contribute even if they don't know
how to write code.

RSVP here: https://www.meetup.com/Code-Mavens/events/246683264/

regards
    Gabor

Subject: [OWASP Israel] OWASP Israel and Defcon Israel meetup - January 28th
Message-ID: <CAJRrLgGn1t+ykO3qaw1khz-S97xNWhHLUgMTJRTaORT0SWf1UA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
Save the date! We are going to have a joint meet-up with Defcon Israel on
January 28th 18:30 in SafeBreach Offices in Tel-Aviv (Yosef Karo 18, 4th
floor, Tel Aviv.)

*The meeting agenda is:*
18:30 - 18:45 networking
18:45 - 19:00 Brief introductions and updates.
19:00 - 19:45 Jumping into Heaven?s Gate - Yarden Shafir
19:45 - 20:30 Breaking obfuscations - Tomer Zait

*Presentations abstract:*

*Title*: Jumping into Heaven?s Gate - Yarden Shafir



*Abstract:*

The old days of 32bit applications are long bygone, nowadays most Operating
Systems are running in a 64bit environment, requiring 64bit applications.

So how can a 64bit Operating System run a 32bit legacy Application?

The native 64bit environment cannot directly support the execution of a
32bit Application.

32bit Applications expect several surrounding pillars which help it perform
necessary actions,

and those no longer exist in a 64bit environment.

However, in practice Windows contains many secrets, and one of those
secrets is the WoW64

subsystem.

The Wow64 Subsystem supplies a natural environment for the legacy 32bit
Application and enables anyone to run them on newer 64bit Operating Systems
without any trouble.

How the subsystem actually does this remains a question to many.

Any Application, whatever its type, begins its execution in 64bit mode.

The Operating System then relentlessly moves forward to the 32bit world by
loading the WoW64 Subsystem, in order to let the 32bit Application execute
freely.

In this talk we will dive into the WoW64 Subsystem and explain how a 32bit
Application performs 64bit (native) system calls.

We will also see how it is possible to exploit this mechanism in order to
create smarter malware that evade Next-Generation and Previous-Generation
AV products and integrates with the Cuckoo Sandbox to ?detonate? the
user-supplied specimen in a controlled environment to observe active mutex
objects and their effects on the malicious program.





*Title:* Breaking obfuscations - Tomer Zait



*Abstract:*

During my journey in de-obfuscating malicious scripts, such as JavaScript
and PowerShell, I have realized that there is a lack of good one-stop-shop
solution. Researchers still perform this tedious task manually while
encountering exploit kits, web injects, PowerShell and python post
exploitation agents as well as different legitimate JavaScript products.
During this Session I will demonstrate working with de-obfuscation tools I
created, of-the-shelf tools and how to create similar tools on your own .
In addition, I will touch Android de-obfuscation in practice and the
obfuscation attack surface each language provides.

Hope to see you all there!
