Subject: [OWASP Israel] Initial presentations online and joining OWASP
	mailing list
Message-ID: <019e01ca313f$b28bd690$17a383b0$@com>

Hi,

 

For those who came, thanks for joining us at OWASP Israel 2009. I think that
those who came (and there where nearly 150 who did so) found the
presentations very interesting.

 

I have uploaded the 1st two presentations from OWASP Israel 2009 online.
While not complete yet, there was lot of requests for Alex's presentation so
I thought it is worth letting you know. So Alex's ReDoS and Ronen's SSSL
presentations can be found here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Israel_2009

 

Additionally, for those of you are not yet members of the OWASP mailing
list, I am adding you to the list. The list is an extremely low volume list
with announcements of OWASP events and from time to time a job search
related mail in the web application field.

 

~ Ofer
