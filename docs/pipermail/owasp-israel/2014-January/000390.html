Subject: [OWASP Israel] Reminder: First OWASP Chapter Meeting in 2014 - Next
Week

 

Just a reminder to everybody that OWASP Israel&#8217;s first chapter meeting of
2014 will be held next week, on Tuesday, January 14, 2014 at 17:00, in the
Amdocs Auditorium. 

 

Please note that registration is required, as the Amdocs security personnel
may check everyone against the full list of names on entrance. (Only your
first and last names are required). 

Please make sure to RSVP here: 

<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-israel-chapter-meeting-jan14-tickets-9892">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-israel-chapter-meeting-jan14-tickets-9892</A>
286094 

If you haven&#8217;t registered yet, please do so soon, so we can get organized
appropriately. 

Likewise if you have registered, but you know that you will not be coming,
please cancel your registration.

NOTE: the registration was closed for a while, since originally there was a
maximum capacity of 100, which filled up pretty quickly. However, Amdocs has
graciously allocated a larger room to accommodate a larger audience, so the
registration has been re-opened. 

 

 

The chapter meeting will take place at the Amdocs&#8217; office, which is located
at Hapnina 8, Raanana. 

The building is called the Kenyon (it's the one on the right, where MS and
other companies are sitting).

In the Kenyon, the conference room is called the Auditorium. 

Parking is available in the visitor's parking lot.

PHP SuperGlobals: Supersized Trouble

Shelly Hershkovitz, Imperva

 

Used in over 80% of all websites, PHP is the most popular Web application
development platform in the world. The widespread use of PHP, however, makes
it an attractive target for malicious hackers. By focusing attacks on
vulnerabilities found in popular third party components, such as PHP,
hackers are able to expand their reach to many unsuspecting websites.

In this talk we look at in-the-wild modification and exploitation of PHP
SuperGlobal variables. This is a special case of a more general weakness
called &#8220;External Variable Modification&#8221;. This weakness was assigned a
specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) code, CWE-473 by MITRE, with the
following description: &#8220;A PHP application does not properly protect against
the modification of variables from external sources, such as query
parameters or cookies&#8221;.

We detail the in the wild exploitation of SuperGlobal variables issues for
the purpose of remote code execution, remote file inclusion, and security
filter evasions attacks. A special focus is given to the analysis of a
specific exploit that combines together different vulnerabilities in order
to achieve remote code execution. The analysis includes a deep dive into the
technical details of each of the vulnerabilities, analysis of the exploit
itself and its use in the wild.

Finally, we suggest several practical steps that allow security officers to
defend their websites against such attacks.

NTLM Based Authentication in Web Applications &#8211; The Good, The Bad, and the
NEW Ugly

Oren Ofer, EY

 

The crusade against NTLM started (without me) over 16 years ago.

Nevertheless, NTLM proved as a cunning opponent; It mutated, improved, got
stronger, survived, and still refuses to go away. &#8220;If there is no struggle
there is no progress&#8221; (F. Douglas).

The lecture will begin with a live demonstration which will reveal a new
design flaw in NTLM along with a dedicated tool that enables attackers to
fully impersonate any web application user.

The lecture will cover the mechanics of the new attack vector and will
inspect its relevancy to OWASP&#8217;s Top 10 categories and its deadliest
attacks.

Master of droids - Latest adventures in Android security bugs

Elad Shapira, AVG

 

This presentation will enable a rare glimpse into the technical details of
recent Android security bugs and in particular the 'master key'
vulnerability.

We will discuss and show what a malicious attacker is able to do with those
bugs all in a wild and fun atmosphere but with a serious, in-depth and
&#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221; perspective.

 

Hope to see you all there! (And don&#8217;t forget to register&#8230;)

 

Avi D 

OWASP IL Chairman
