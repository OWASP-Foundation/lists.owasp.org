Subject: [OWASP Israel] OWASP AppSec Israel 2017 Call For Presentation (CFP)
Message-ID: <0be401d2f96b$a6070320$f2150960$@owasp.org>

(????? ????)

Hi all! 

 

We're happy to announce that the Call for Presentations (CF) for the OWASP AppSec Israel 2017 conference is now open!

 

The OWASP AppSecIL conference is seeking presenters from the application security community to discuss interesting topics related to the security of applications, from the fields of web, mobile, cloud, and other types of software. 

 

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will take place this year on Wednesday, October 18th, 2017 ? a week after Sukkot, for a full day. 

The conference will be held in The College of Management (Michlala l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion, and we are expecting over 700 attendees this year. 

This year, there will also be an additional Training Day right before the Conference, on Tuesday, October 17th, 2017. A separate Call for Trainings will come shortly. 

 

In order to ensure fascinating lectures as every year, we are opening a Call for Presentations and anyone is invited to submit a proposal for a presentation. (See link below.)

This year, we are trying to improve our CFP process, and are implementing double blind reviews for talk selection. We hope this will help us remove any hidden bias, increase diversity, and bring in fresh new speakers! 

We will be happy to hear any constructive comments on this new process. 

 

As always, talks are selected based on content and quality of submission, and are completely independent of any vendor or sponsor support. 

 

If this will be your first time presenting at a conference, don?t worry! We can offer you a speaker mentor if you want, though it is not mandatory. (Mentorship is available for experienced speakers too :-) )

 

Some possible topics include, but are not limited to: 

*        Secure development: secure coding, static analysis, application threat modelling, web frameworks security, countermeasures, SDLC, DevOps, etc.

*        Mobile security: Development and/or testing devices and the mobile web

*        Cloud security: Offensive and defensive considerations for cloud-based web applications

*        Applicative Infrastructure security: Database security, VoIP, hardware, identity management

*        Penetration testing: Methodologies, tools, exploit development, evasion techniques, OSINT, etc.

*        Emerging web technologies and associated security considerations

*        Internet of Things: IoT security and other devices

*        SCADA and Industrial Control Systems: and how these can be secured, or hacked, at an application or software level.

*        Applied Cryptography: Relevant research, new models, algorithm usage, interesting attacks, and other applications.

*        Incident response: Threat detection, triage, malware analysis, forensics, rootkit detection

*        OWASP tools and projects in practice

*        Policy and legal: Legislation, privacy, regulations and compliance, C-level considerations, etc.

*        Cool hacks and other fun stuff: cryptography, social engineering, etc.

We're looking forward for interesting and exciting talks!

Subject: [OWASP Israel] AppSec Israel 2017 Sponsorships
Message-ID: <CAJRrLgE4rN2nH8tjLSTO_sanQhCfKMp7tnxhBfuE+FJVMiXC1g@mail.gmail.com>

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference is the largest conference in
Israel for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of
participants. Over 650 people attended last year!

Whether you have a product to showcase, offering a service, or you are
recruiting, sponsoring the OWASP AppSec Israel event gets you the right
exposure. This year we are expecting well over 700 attendees, including
security professionals, developers, managers, and more. The conference will
take place this year on Wednesday, October 18th, 2017, at The College of
Management (Michlala l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion ? just south of Tel Aviv.

In addition, we will be hosting a free Training Day, part of the OWASP
World Tour, on October 17th, 2017. This will provide developers with the
basic skills they need to build secure systems.

Sponsoring the AppSecIL Conference also helps support the OWASP community,
and ensures that we can keep on making our conferences better and better.
Sponsorship fees are intended to cover the costs of the Conference. Since
the Conference is open to all and free of charge to attend, we need your
support to enable us to put on a great conference.

*Past sponsors include Intuit, SafeBreach, GE Digital, Akamai, Imperva,
Checkmarx, Synopsys, Ben Gurion University, LivePerson, and many others*.

OWASP is an open source, non-profit organization. While our activities are
free for all, we do have costs, and need your help to make our activities
better.

We are now offering Silver, Gold and Platinum sponsorship levels. There is
also a cost-effective ?Community Supporter? option for non-profits,
government offices, small startups, and such. Of course, if you are a
Corporate Member of OWASP (at any level) and allocate a percentage (20-40%)
of your membership fees to the Israel Chapter, we consider those funds as
conference sponsorship accordingly.

*Early bird sponsors that sign a contract by September 1st will get a 10%
discount. *

For more details, see in
https://www.owasp.org/images/5/50/AppSec_Israel_2017_Sponsorships.pdf or
reach out to me directly.


Thanks.

	Presentation (CFP)
Message-ID: <06d301d305f5$bea33610$3be9a230$@owasp.org>

(????? ????)

Hi all! 

 

We're happy to announce that the Call for Presentations (CF) for the OWASP AppSec Israel 2017 conference is now open!

 

The OWASP AppSecIL conference is seeking presenters from the application security community to discuss interesting topics related to the security of applications, from the fields of web, mobile, cloud, and other types of software. 

 

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will take place this year on Wednesday, October 18th, 2017 ? a week after Sukkot, for a full day. 

The conference will be held in The College of Management (Michlala l?Minhal), in Rishon LeZion, and we are expecting over 700 attendees this year. 

This year, there will also be an additional Training Day right before the Conference, on Tuesday, October 17th, 2017. A separate Call for Trainings will come shortly. 

 

In order to ensure fascinating lectures as every year, we are opening a Call for Presentations and anyone is invited to submit a proposal for a presentation. (See link below.)

This year, we are trying to improve our CFP process, and are implementing double blind reviews for talk selection. We hope this will help us remove any hidden bias, increase diversity, and bring in fresh new speakers! 

We will be happy to hear any constructive comments on this new process. 

 

As always, talks are selected based on content and quality of submission, and are completely independent of any vendor or sponsor support. 

 

If this will be your first time presenting at a conference, don?t worry! We can offer you a speaker mentor if you want, though it is not mandatory. (Mentorship is available for experienced speakers too :-) )

 

Some possible topics include, but are not limited to: 

*        Secure development: secure coding, static analysis, application threat modelling, web frameworks security, countermeasures, SDLC, DevOps, etc.

*        Mobile security: Development and/or testing devices and the mobile web

Subject: [OWASP Israel] Reminder: OWASP AppSec Israel 2017 Call for Sponsors!
Message-ID: <078f01d30610$6b5a26b0$420e7410$@owasp.org>

The annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference is the largest conference in
Israel for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of
participants. Over 650 people attended last year! 

 

Whether you have a product to showcase, offering a service, or you are
recruiting, sponsoring the OWASP AppSec Israel event gets you the right
exposure. This year we are expecting well over 700 attendees, including
security professionals, developers, managers, and more. 

 

The conference will take place this year on Wednesday, October 18th, 2017,
at The College of Management (Michlala l'Minhal), in Rishon LeZion - just
south of Tel Aviv. In addition, we will be hosting a free Training Day, part
of the OWASP World Tour, on October 17th, 2017. This will provide developers
with the basic skills they need to build secure systems. 

 

Sponsoring the AppSecIL Conference also helps support the OWASP community,
and ensures that we can keep on making our conferences better and better.
Sponsorship fees are intended to cover the costs of the Conference. Since
the Conference is open to all and free of charge to attend, we need your
support to enable us to put on a great conference. 

 

Past sponsors include Intuit, SafeBreach, GE Digital, Akamai, Imperva,
Checkmarx, Synopsys, Ben Gurion University, LivePerson, and many others. 

 

OWASP is an open source, non-profit organization. While our activities are
free for all, we do have costs, and need your help to make our activities
better. 

 

We are now offering Silver, Gold and Platinum sponsorship levels. There is
also a cost-effective "Community Supporter" option for non-profits,
government offices, small startups, and such. Of course, if you are a
Corporate Member of OWASP (at any level) and allocate a percentage (20-40%)
of your membership fees to the Israel Chapter, we consider those funds as
conference sponsorship accordingly. 

 

Early bird sponsors that sign a contract by September 1st will get a 10%
discount. 

 

For more details, see
https://www.owasp.org/images/5/50/AppSec_Israel_2017_Sponsorships.pdf or
reach out to me directly.

 

Thanks!
