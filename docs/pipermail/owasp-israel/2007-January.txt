The agenda:


17:15 - Gathering, Socializing and Pizzas 


17:30 - Source Code Analysis and Application Security - Cheating the
maze 

Maty Siman, Founder & CTO, Checkmarx <http://www.checkmarx.com/>  

During the last few years automatically analyzing source code in order
to find security vulnerabilities became a popular method in the field of
Application Security. The presentation will discuss the theory and
research of static code analysis, the application of static code
analysis for security, comparing this method to other application
security defense technologies and will demonstrate the use of static
code analysis for application security. 


18:30 - Security Implications of .Net 3.0 and the Windows Communication
Foundation (WCF) 

Emmanuel Cohen-Yashar (Manu), Senior .NET technology consultant, Sela
Group <http://www.sela.co.il>  

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is the new Microsoft
communication framework bundled as part of of .NET Framework 3.0, the
new .NET Windows API succeeding Win32 with the release of Windows Vista.
WCF programming model unifies Web Services, .NET Remoting, Distributed
Transactions, and Message Queues into a single Service-oriented
programming model for distributed computing. The presentation will
describe the tenets of SOA - Service Oriented Architecture, introduce
WCF and discuss the security implications of this broad new
communication paradigm. 


19:30 - Analysis of the Universal XSS PDF vulnerability - Cause,
Solutions and Fun staff 

Ofer Shezaf, CTO, Breach Security <http://www.breach.com> , Leader or
ModSecurity Core Rule Set
<http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/rules/index.html>  open source
project 

Recently a new vulnerability was discovered in commonly used versions of
Adobe Acrobat software. Unlike common XSS attacks that require a
specific vulnerability in the attacked web site, in this case the
vulnerability in Acrobat is sufficient and no fault is required in the
attacked web site, and any site that serves PDF files is vulnerable.
Therefore it is called "universal XSS" vulnerability. 

The presentation will describe the vulnerability, the theoretical and
practical solutions for the vulnerability as well as some very funny
stories about the dynamics of such a high profile vulnerability, or in
other words, what happens when you try to get a car mechanic to fix an
application security vulnerability.
