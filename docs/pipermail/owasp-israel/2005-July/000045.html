Hi All,

 

OWASP IL leaders is a group of people that are dedicated to pushing
forward the OWASP Israeli chapter. We held a first leaders meeting last
week and this e-mail summarizes it. We are not a closed group, and
anyone who is interested to join the leaders group and is willing to
commit to it is welcomed - just send me a note. 

 

You don't have to become a leader to contribute and if you think that
you are interested in one of the projects listed below, please contact
me of directly the project leader. Specifically OWASP IL is currently
looking for sponsors in two areas:

- Meetings hosting.

- OWASP document translations.

We believe that both of these opportunities provide good return for the
sponsor.

 

The members of the leaders group are Irene Abezgauz , Guy Fighel, Moshe
Basol, Ofer Maor, Shai Zalal Yachin, Asaf Wexler, Amit Klein, Avishay
Gaziel, Roni Bachar &amp; myself. We are meeting monthly in order to ensure
continuous projects drive.

 

We have decided to embark on the following activities:

 

- Periodical meetings: like the one held in June. Shai Zalal-Yachin,
Ofer Maor and I will organize and select the content for the meetings. A
date for the next meeting and a call for presentations will follow in
the coming weeks.

 

- Content: Irene Abezgauz is OWASP IL content project leader, which
includes translation of OWASP documents such as the OWASP top 10 and the
OWASP guide to Hebrew. Apart from translation we are also looking for
publishing short articles (in Hebrew) about application security. If you
wanted to publish, this is your chance to get OWASP accreditation for
your article. Contact Irene for details.

 

- PR: Avishay Gaziel is OWASP IL PR project leader. Avhishay will
establish channels to the media in order to push OWASP and application
security stories suitable for the media and establish OWASP as a
reference for comments about related news stories.

 

- Education: Guy Fighel is OWASP IL educational project leader. Guy will
lead our effort to create academic level education material about
application security and push it to Universities, Colleges and
commercial training companies. Guy will also lead the effort to organize
an academic level application security conference in Israel.

 

- Legal: Asaf Wexler is OWASP IL legal project leader. Asaf will
establish relations with law and regulation enforcements organizations
in Israel in order to incorporate application security requirements and
reference to OWASP standards in them.

 

- Web site: the chapter is planning of having a web site
(www.owasp.org.il &lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org.il/">http://www.owasp.org.il/</A>&gt; ) to publish application
security content and the chapter's activities. We are still looking for
a volunteer to take care of the technical sides.
