Don?t forget to register for the DevSecCon conference next Monday in Tel Aviv! Details below. 

I hear they are having some amazing speakers? ;-) 

 

We will also be having an OWASP Israel Chapter meetup on Tuesday evening ? over 180 have already registered to attend! 

There will be 2 talks at the meetup, in addition to plenty of time for networking and meeting the rest of the community: 

Pushing Left Like a Boss by Tanya Janca (who is also a Keynote Speaker at DevSecCon, as well as OWASP DevSlop project leader and OWASP Ottawa chapter leader). 

Crypto-mining: The New Force Behind Remote Code Execution Attacks by Gilad Yehudai and Natan Elul (both security researchers with Imperva, and both with advanced academic degrees). 

More details and registration here: https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Israel/events/249361818/ 

 

In addition, the CyberLadies group will be hosting a women-only event on Wednesday evening, featuring Tanya Janca (again!) as well as Michal Braverman-Blumenstyk (CTO of the Cloud and Security division at Microsoft). 

More details and registration here: https://www.facebook.com/events/195752657900950/ 

 

I hope to see you at some of these events! 

(But not at the CyberLadies group, I won?t be going to that since it is for women only :D )

Hi Everybody!
I am happy to announce that the annual OWASP AppSec Israel Conference will
take place this year on Thursday, September 6th, 2018.

This year for the first ever, we will partner with Tel Aviv University to
host the conference in the University facility.

As you all know, OWASP?s AppSec Israel is the largest conference in Israel
for application security, and regularly draws hundreds of participants.
Last year over 650 people attended ? don?t miss it this year!
The Conference will include multiple lecture tracks, and a sponsors display
area for vendors of products and services relevant to Application Security.

We will open the Call for Presentations (CFP) and the Call for Training
(CFT) soon, within the next few weeks ? so start writing up your ideas!

We also want to continue the tradition that was started last year, to have
another full day of Security Training just before the conference day. We
are reaching out to you, AppSec community to help and support us for making
it happen, we are looking for trainers and sponsors.

The Training event will be conducted by professional security trainers,
selected by OWASP, and free to attend.

We will also start a sponsorship drive soon, in the meantime, if you are
interested in volunteering some time and effort, we could use your help!

Looking forward to seeing you all!

Hi Everyone! 

 

We will be having our fantastic yearly AppSecIL conference this year on September 5-6, 2018. 

This year we have a wonderful new venue in central Tel Aviv ? Tel Aviv University. The Conference will be on Thursday, September 6th, and it will be preceded by a full day of free developer training on Wednesday the 5th. 

 

As you probably know, OWASP is a non-profit organization, and we have no corporate or financial backing. The AppSec Israel Conference is always free, as well as the Training Day. 

 

But we need your help to support it and keep it free, and allow us to reach as many people as possible! 

 

An AppSec Israel sponsor booth is also an excellent place to reach many of your target audience, with so many of our industry ? security researchers, CISOs, appsec practitioners, security-aware developers ? attending. This is the place to reach them all, whether you are wanting to sell your product or your service, or if you are just looking to recruit top talent. 

 

You can see more details and the available options here: https://2018.appsecil.org/assets/AppSecIL_2018_Sponsorships.pdf 

This year we are keeping the existing prices mostly without change, and we also added a few interesting benefits and options! 

 

There is also an Early bird discount on the premium tiers, for anyone that signs by July 15th.  

If last year is any indication, the best ones will go fast ;-)  

 

Please be in touch with me directly via email (avi.douglen at owasp.org <mailto:avi.douglen at owasp.org> ) to finalize and reserve your place as soon as you can. 

 

Thank you! 

Avi D 

OWASP Israel Board member and AppSecIL organizing committee
