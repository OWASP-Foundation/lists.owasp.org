Thanks to everybody who participated and supported us! 

 

Most of the presentations are already online -

will be uploaded as soon as possible. 

 

If you have any pictures, videos, etc of the conference - please send a link
to them, to Ofer Shezaf (ofer at shezaf.com <mailto:ofer at shezaf.com> ) to share
on the web page. 

 

Some numbers about the Conference: 

-          Well over 450 attended (out of 615 registered). For context, this
was bigger than AppSecEU! 

-          11 Sponsors

-          9 Booths

-          12 Track sessions (in 2 auditoriums)

-          2 Plenary sessions

-          17 Speakers 

-          3 coffee breaks and one lunch :) 

 

Our thanks go out to: 

-          A special thanks to Dr. Anat Bremler and the IDC, who graciously
host us every year. 

-          Thank you to all the sponsors that enabled us to make the most
out of the conference, without worrying about hunger, thirst, or caffeine
deficiency. 

-          Thanks to all the speakers, who made it all worthwhile.  

-          Thanks also to all those who submitted a proposal for a talk, but
unfortunately we were not able to fit in this year. I hope you continue to
contribute, and that we'll be able to hear you next time! 

-          And thanks to all the staff that helped organize the event -
Ilil, Ofer, Or, Ory, and Itzik! 

 

See you next year!

Hi, 

I noticed that not many people filled out the feedback forms (despite Ofer's
frequent reminders :) )

Less than 10%...! 

 

For those of you who didn't fill out a form (or email your feedback to one
of the board members), please take a few moments to fill out this online
form:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15w2uyw8pY5tj2rGgcjUenct-5eFteLD35juYdYRX9mY
/ 

(If you did already write/email your feedback, no need to repeat it).

 

Your feedback on the conference is VERY important to us, to help us decide
which sessions to select for next year's conference. Please fill out your
feedback. (And no need to try to brute-force the form either, that is no
challenge. So please don't. ) 

 

Unlike with the written forms, we are trying to collect some additional
information about you, for statistics and better targeting. 

YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILL OUT THESE FIELDS, but it is helpful if you
choose to do so. 

 

Thank you,

Avi D

Much thanks to Checkmarx for filming most of the sessions! 

 

If anybody has any more pictures, videos etc of the event - please send them

In addition, as I am officially taking over the position of Chairman of the
Israel branch of OWASP, I would like to extend our gratitude to Ofer Maor,
for his 4 years of tireless and tiring service as Chairman. 

Thankfully, Ofer will continue on the chapter board, in addition to being
involved with OWASP at a global level. 

Thank you Ofer!
