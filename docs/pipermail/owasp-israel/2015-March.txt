chapter meeting. 

Reminder: the meeting will take place on March 30th, at 17:00, in NCR's
office in Raanana, 9 Dafna St.  

 

Registration link: https://owasp-israel-march-2015.eventbrite.com 

 

Agenda: 

 

-          17:00 - 17:30

Gathering, food & drinks (KOSHER)

 

-          17:30 - 17:40

Opening Note

 

-          17:40 - 18:20

>From Zero to Secure in One Minute

Nir Valtman, NCR

 

Nir will share with us his talk that he is giving the week before at Black
Hat Asia, on securing IaaS instances in an automated, dynamic manner. 

Nir will also introduce a new open source tool called "Cloudefigo" and
explain how it enables accelerated security lifecycle. We demonstrate how to
launch a pre-configured, already patched instance into an encrypted storage
environment automatically while evaluating their security and mitigating
them automatically if a vulnerability is found. In the live demo, we
leverage Amazon Web Services EC2 Cloud-Init scripts and object storage for
provisioning automated security configuration, integrating encryption,
including secure encryption key repositories for secure server's
communication. The result of those techniques is cloud servers that are
resilient, automatically configured, with reduced attack surface.

 

-          18:20 - 19:00

Shell over what ?! Naughty CDN manipulations 

Roee Cnaan, Cipher Security

 

In this talk, Roee will introduce the unique concept of carrying malicious
traffic over Content Distribution Networks and de-facto whitening and hiding
it by using CDN native features.

 

-          19:00 - 19:20

Coffee break

 

-          19:20 - 20:00 

TBA

 

 

Looking forward to seeing you all there!

agenda has been updated. Please see below. 

 

A reminder, if you are planning on coming to the OWASP chapter meeting,
please register: https://owasp-israel-march-2015.eventbrite.com

Transcending From Digital to Physical

Yaniv Simsolo, Palantir Security

 

The next generation of attacks aimed at the physical realm, can be attained
using the digital realm. The origins of hacking were aimed at the physical,
long since have been replaced with money gaining hacks, are back with us.

Since the Moore's Law is becoming invalid, hackers possess greater abilities
than ever. Re-aiming the guns towards the physical realm is highly
lucrative. We will discuss and demonstrate attack vectors on the digital
realm aimed at the physical realm.

Coffee break

 

-          19:30 - 20:15 

Collateral DDoS

Ido Leibovich, Imperva

 

Application Layer DDoS attacks are well known and well-studied for many
years, with numerous attack vectors varying in their origin and in their
methods, but sharing the basic objective to deprave the ability of the
target application to serve its clients. 

In this session we will present a very unique DDoS attack that we stumbled
upon when monitoring web traffic, whose targets are innocent applications,
which seem to be chosen at random. 

We will show how DNS corruption operations allegedly made as part of the
so-called "Great Firewall of China", the well-known censorship system of
Chinese authorities, with the peer-to-peer unmanaged nature of the
BitTorrent ecosystem, result in massive and synchronized HTTP traffic
targeted to arbitrary victim applications, and in highly effective DDoS
attack on these applications. 

We will show how this attack looks like from the victim side, including the
timeline and the volume of the attack traffic. 

We will also isolate the parts of the BitTorrent protocol that make it prone
to become the ground for such attacks.

 

Reminder: the meeting will take place on March 30th, at 17:00, in NCR's
office in Raanana, 9 Dafna St.  

 

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
