<PRE>Hi Friends,

As 2017 draws to a close, I find myself reminiscing about major application
security risks today. Unsurprisingly, I recall the OWASP Top 10
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project</A>&gt;, which has
become a de facto standard for web application security. In the Information
Security industry, it is well known that once a web application or service
is hosted, it is likely to be automatically probed for security flaws - and
perhaps compromised - within hours.

This year, the  OWASP Top Ten was revamped to cater to the latest changes
in web development technology.

Whether you're developing, maintaining, or own a web application or
website, the top 10 security risks you should be aware of and mitigate are:

*Injection: *Flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when
untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

*Broken Authentication: *Application functions related to authentication
and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing
attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens.

*Sensitive Data Exposure:* Sensitive data may be compromised without extra
protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special
precautions when exchanged with the browser.

*XML External Entities:* Many older or poorly configured XML parsers
evaluate external entity references within XML documents, which can lead to
remote code execution, denial of service, and other problems.

*Broken Access Control:* Restrictions on what authenticated users are
allowed to do are often not properly enforced.

*Security Misconfiguration:* This very common issue is usually a result of
insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, open
cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages
containing sensitive information.

*Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):* XSS flaws occur whenever an application
includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or
escaping.

*Insecure Deserialization:* This can often to lead to remote execution of
malicious code by attackers.

*Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:* If your software uses any
component - including 3rd party or open source - that has security flaws,
it could make your entire application and server vulnerable.

*Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring:* This allows attackers to further
attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper,
extract, or destroy data.

The list and description above is a tip of the iceberg. Click here to read
all about The OWASP Top 10 2017, including suggested mitigations.

Many thanks to my friend and co-lead at OWASP Nigeria, Eyitemi Egbejule,
for drawing my attention to OWASP Top 10 2017.

Best Regards,

Damilare
