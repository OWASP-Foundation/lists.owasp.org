Subject: [Owasp-nigeria] Are You Writing Secure Code?
Message-ID: <CAGphRea=bAvinmNsyW-_WBDFo0yU7be=SOkH20PM9NBysLzcAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Team,

*Adding security after bugs have been found by QA or your product has
shipped means you have to redesign and recode; more work, more expenses.
Whereas, if as early as product conception your team performs *
*secure design reviews and threat modelling, developers will naturally
Think Security while coding; Secure Coding.*

That's the teaser for a blog post
<http://damilarefagbemi.com/are-you-writing-secure-code/> I wrote up on
that topic over the weekend, And if you don't have time to read through my
ramblings... here are the most important bits

*My Top Picks for Secure Coding Guidelines and Principles*

1. The SEI CERT Coding Standards from the Software Engineering Institute at
Carnegie Mellon
<https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SEI+CERT+Coding+Standards>:
This includes detailed guidelines for secure coding in C, C++, Java, Perl,
and Android
2. The OWASP Secure Coding Practices ? Quick  Reference Guide
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide>:
Technology agnostic, general secure coding best practices.
3. The OWASP Secure Code Review Guide
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_review_V2_Table_of_Contents> to
check your code for security issues before they get exploited.

*Games for learning secure coding!*
