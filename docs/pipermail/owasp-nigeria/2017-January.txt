Hi Folks,

We're set to host the second OWASP Nigeria meetup event in Lagos on January
28, 2017. The day's agenda is a workshop on Secure Application Design.

This event targeted at application developers, architects, and security
professionals; anyone who's involved in building software.

More details and tickets are available on EventBrite
<https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/designing-secure-applications-tickets-8530732651>
.

Please connect with us on Facebook <https://facebook.com/owasplagos> and
Twitter <https://twitter.com/owasplagos> so you don't miss out on events,
security tips/ tools etc.

Cheers.

Best Regards,
Damilare

A great video I stumbled upon that provides an overview of the latest or
trending technologies in web development... back end, front end,
containers, devOps, cloud platforms etc.

It's a cool resource!

Hi Friends,

We deeply apologize for the late cancellation of the OWASP event planned
for January 28, 2017. Changes in the schedules of the speakers led to the
postponement of the event. The class will be rescheduled and updates
communicated.

We will keep sharing security tips, tools, and resources via social media (
https://twitter.com/owasplagos , http://facebook.com/owasplagos) and the
mailing list (owasp-nigeria at lists.owasp.org. Please join the conversation
as we continue to spread information security awareness.

'Let's build a secure future together'

Best Regards,

Damilare, OWASP Nigeria Chapter Lead
