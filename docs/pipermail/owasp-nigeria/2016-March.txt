	Testing Standard Initiative
Message-ID: <CAGphReaM0vd43gisV8Fj57EkVdbWv0Wysa=O9f6_1b=kgfn0og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Rotimi,

Great question. After the physical workshop, I think it should be possible
to share the drafted penetration testing standard  with OWASP members (and
other relevant parties) for feedback before it's finalized.

I can check this with Suleiman Farouk, who is NITDA's consultant on the
project.
