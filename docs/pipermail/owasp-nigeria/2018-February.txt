Subject: [Owasp-nigeria] OWASP Twitter and Facebook access
Message-ID: <CA+J2pFD71mtWDWoseFbh84AmaXaWfCQO-fPXwKQp=gs86c=NPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Deji, Shehu,

Apologies for asking about this repeatedly, but please can you share the
access credentials for the OWASP facebook and twitter accounts? We'll both
save it this time.

Eyitemi has been sharing some security updates with his circles and a slack
channel he leads. It'll be great if he can do the same via our OWASP
Nigeria social media accounts.

Eyitemi,
You can share with the OWASPmailing list via an email to
owasp-nigeria at lists.owasp.org.

To make it easy, perhaps you can setup some social media/ slack channel
bookmarks on your browser, then share any updates you have to all platforms.


Best Regards,
Damilare
