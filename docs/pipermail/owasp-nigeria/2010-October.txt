Subject: [Owasp-nigeria] UK Government ICT Strategy - Lessons for Nigeria
Message-ID: <63F9EEB44C574274AB83DEFDB9E1C05A@IDARAPC>

What lessons can Nigeria learn from the below?

The Cabinet Office published its "smarter, cheaper, greener" ICT
Strategy at the end of January:

http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2010/100127-ict.aspx

 to reduce costs and "create one secure, resilient and flexible
 network" and "deliver best IT to the public".  The 19 strategic
 principles include:

 * Ensure security from design through implementation to operation
 * Adopt greater standardisation and simplification

 * Adopt the principles of using open standards

 It's quite high-level, but I was wondering if anyone wanted to get
 together and provide feedback regarding this, on behalf of OWASP?  We
 should be encouraging the adoption of secure development and
 procurement practices.  Is this one place to do it?

 The key documents/sections are:

 The Conservative Party also have a parallel consultation document:

      http://www.makeitbetter.org.uk/?page_id=298

 that could be responded to as well.

Have you bought web application security books?

Used web application security resources such as Foundstone's  Hackme series 
and OWASP WebGoat


OWASP WebGoat Project
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebGoat_Project

Subject: [WEB SECURITY] Hacking The Interwebs


http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/hacking-the-interwebs

When the victim visits a malicious SWF file, a 4 step ATTACK will silently execute in the background. At that moment the attacker will have control over their router, pretty much regardless of its model. Many of the home routers are vulnerable to this attack as many of them support UPnP to one degree or another.

The attack does not rely on any bugs. Simply put, when two completely legitimate technologies, Flash and UPnP, are combined together, they compose a vulnerability, which exposes many home networks to a great risk. The attack depends on the fact that most, if not all, routers are UPnP enabled. The UPnP SOAP service can be accessed without authorization over the default Web Admin Interface. With the help of Flash, the attacker can send arbitrary SOAP messages to the router's UPnP control point and as such reconfigure the device in order to enable further attacks.. 

The most malicious of all malicious things to do when a device is compromised via the attack described in the link pointed at the top of this email, is to change the primary DNS server. That will effectively turn the router and the network it controls into a zombie which the attacker can take advantage of whenever they feel like it. It is also possible to reset the admin credentials and create the sort of onion routing network all bad guys want. Many routers come with Layer3 portforwarding UPnP service. This is also a potential vector that attackers can use. In cases like this, they will simply expose ports behind the router on the Internet facing side. 

We hope that by exposing this information, we will drastically improve the situation for the future. I think that this is a lot better than keeping it for ourselves or risking it all by given the criminals the opportunity to have in possession a secret which no one else is aware of. The best way to protect against this attack is turn off UPnP if your router's Admin Interface allows it. It seams that many routers simply does not have this feature.

Message-ID: <B27FF32F7E4E4BDFB95C2A1FD3A5AC9F@IDARAPC>

Hi Members of OWASP Nigeria Mailing List,

In technology matters we are often behind the curve.

Here is something starting or shall I say about to flower, how can we ensure 
that our Universities in Nigeria, Polytechnic Institutes, IT Schools and 
Other Academic Institutions Key into this?

Every other day in Nigeria we hear of some electronic/online banking/ATM 
fraud, how can we help grow a crop of websites/web application technology 
security specialists as well as awareness.

One way to go is to join the OWASP Nigeria Initiative.

Yet another way is to work on your contacts with the various educational 
institutions listed above and cause them to key into the OWASP Academies 
intiative from the very start.

Let's do more than just complain that the educational sector is less than 
perfect.

Let's do something positive.

>>> The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) set up a new working group
>>> WEBSEC (http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/websec/charter/) to identify
>>> and tackle these underlying issues and develop standards to solve them
>>> wherever possible. It will also work closely with the W3C Web
>>> Application Security Working Group to get the new changes on the road
>>> and implemented.
>>>
>>> These two working groups will provide the unique opportunity to
>>> actually change some of the underlying mechanisms and try to solve
>>> some of our biggest security challenges at the root. But for that to
>>> accomplish, it is important to understand what the problem and what
>>> should be done and what better place then OWASP, with the best Web
>>> Application Security minds, to ask what is good and what should be
>>> changed and corrected and in which way.
>>>
>>> So I would like to invite you to provide input for this and join the
>>> WEBSEC working group (note: the IETF is an open organization like
>>> OWASP and all WGs are open for everybody to join freely).
>>> You can join the group and its mailing-list here:
>>> https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/websec
>>> If you are new to the IETF, there is a small info page Tao of the IETF
>>> (http://www.ietf.org/tao.html)
>>>
>>> So what are your ideas to help mitigate many of the OWASP top ten?
>>> What are the biggest problems?
>>> What should be done?
>>> What HTTP headers, protocol and policies would you suggest we change
>>> or correct?
>>> Do we need to standardize new headers and certain browser behavior
>>> across the vendors?
>>> How should browsers behave to be safe or how should their behavior
>>> change for use to be able to build more secure web applications?
>>>
>>> The time frame for this opportunity of change is within the next few
>>> months, so if you have ideas and suggestions please come forward and
>>> we need to work on them now!
>>>
>>> Just as an example of the first items that we discuss are Media Type
>>> Sniffing, Web Origin Concept, integrity of the browser and server,
>>> usage of DNSSEC, Strict Transport Security, X-FRAME-OPTIONS, but
>>> there's a lot more to do and we need your input as OWASP experts!
>>>
>>> So if you have ideas, please join the WG and/or get in touch with me.
>>> And please forward this to interested chapters and people!
>>>
>>> Kind regards, Tobias
