<PRE>Hi Friends,

Apologies for this pretty short notice, but I would like to give some heads
up about a cyber security event to be led in Kano, by one of OWASP
Nigeria's leaders, Shehu Awwal.
Shehu is active leader in the information security ecosystem in Nigeria. He
is an avid pen tester. You can find more information about him and his work
on his website, <A HREF="https://www.shawsec.com/.">https://www.shawsec.com/.</A>

*For many of us who won't be able to make it to Kano, the session will be
recorded and shared via YouTube.*

*Event Date: *June 28, 2018
*Time:* 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM
*Venue: * Maiduguri Road, Opposite Al-Yuma House, Tarauni 700223, Kano

*Title: Cyber Security Awareness: Protecting Accounts Against Hackers*

In this talk, Shehu Awwal, an experienced Cybersecurity, researcher will
discuss Information and Data Security. He will demonstrate How Script
Kiddies, Hackers, and Social-Engineers use different ways to get
Information. He will provide in-depth analysis of attacker techniques like
Spear Phishing, Phishing, Email Spoofing.

Shehu will also explain how Internet users in Nigeria can avoid scams
perpetrated through Email, Text etc., Using OWASP references and prevention
guides. Finally, the SEToolkit will be used to demonstrate how Network
Attacks occur and how they can be prevented.


Best Regards,
Damilare
