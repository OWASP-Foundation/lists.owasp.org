Subject: [Owasp-nigeria] Kicking of 2016 with 2 Information Security Events
	in Lagos, Nigeria
Message-ID: <CAGphReb=TvUvw2-ooqOPui3kPO9eFXx=7z0wNhxG42+_Ro=atA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Team,

I am Damilare, a Product Security Champion at Intel and Chapter Lead at the
Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Nigeria in Lagos. My
Co-leads, Ayodeji, Temitayo, and I came on board as Chapter leads in Lagos
in November, 2015.

It's barely halfway through January and it's shaping up to be a very
interesting year for Information Security in Nigeria.

We want to invite you to two events:

   1. Nigeria's first Security BSides event <http://www.bsideslagos.org/>
   on January 22, 2016: Please register here
   <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bsides-lagos-cyber-security-conference-tickets-20087864343>
   2. Nigeria's first OWASP event on February 13, 2016: Please register here
   <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/meet-ethical-hackers-at-the-first-owasp-lagos-meetup-tickets-20788008493>

We will share more information on the OWASP Event in a separate email.

Hi Team,

We want to invite you to the very first OWASP meeting in Nigeria scheduled
for February 13, 2016. It's going to be a fun hacking experience.

We will provide some background on OWASP to set the stage and have already
lined up 3 talks:


Talk 1: Introduction to OWASP ZAP, the integrated web application
penetration testing tool

Talk 2: Exploiting a Vulnerable website to steal user credentials and gain
root

Talk 3: The OWASP Web Security Shepherd, a web and mobile application
security training platform

You can register here
<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/meet-ethical-hackers-at-the-first-owasp-lagos-meetup-tickets-20788008493>

*If you would like to give a talk or speak about one of
the identified topics, please drop me a line.*
