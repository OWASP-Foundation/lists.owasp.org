Subject: [Owasp-java-encoder-project] Buffer overflow in OWASP Encoder v1.1
Message-ID: <52B8B695.3090808@mir3.com>

I just updated issue #4 on the Google Code project's issue tracker-- 
somebody else had reported this bug back in October, but we added a 
proposed fix and test case to the issue.

I'm just posting to the mailing list because I'm not entirely sure that 
the Google Code issue tracker is being monitored-- if that's not the 
right place to report issues, then could somebody kindly direct me to 
the right place?

A buffer overflow in a Java library ?

That's interesting, are there more details published

Dinis - This is not a buffer overflow, rather
an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. I am a bit buried right now; I'll try to
take a look at this soon (unless of course Jeff gets to it first).

Mark - Thanks for reporting this and providing the patch!
