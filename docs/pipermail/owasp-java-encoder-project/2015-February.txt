We are using encoder-1.1.1.jar with one of our projects. We want to include the license, however, on the main page for the encoder project, the license reference is just a link to the BSD 3-Clause License template, without the OWASP name, year, etc. It doesn't exist in the repo or the jar either. Is there some place we can get a copy of it. I don't feel that filling out the template myself is quite acceptable. :)

Sure. The license link on the OWAP Java Encoder Project page 
is http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause. When you follow that
link, you get


"Here is the license template:

It's just a template. It doesn't mention the year, owner, or any info that 
identifies OWASP or the project. A completed version of the template probably
should be included in the source tree and the jars.

Regards,
Bill

Bill,

Do you have time to add the new license to the repo for us?  You 
contribution would be a great help. I'm a bit out of position right now.

I at least get the problem you are facing.

Aloha,
Jim

I'd be glad to. What should the year and owner values be?

Cool?

Thank you Bill! Shall I give you commit access? If so, what email?

Aloha,
