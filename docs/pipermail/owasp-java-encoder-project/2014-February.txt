Subject: [Owasp-java-encoder-project] OWASP Java Encoder 1.1.1 released!
Message-ID: <52EF73A3.5030607@owasp.org>

The OWASP Java Encoder is a Java 1.5 simple-to-use drop-in 
*high-performance* encoder class with no dependencies and little 
baggage. This project will help Java web developers defend against Cross 
Site Scripting!

Version 1.1.1 of the OWASP Java Encoder has been released.

Release Notes:

1) ESAPI for Java Integration! The following Jar will override the 
default ESAPI Java Encoder class and will provide a rather dramatic 
increase in runtime performance, a rather dramatic decrease in object 
instantiation and a rather dramatic reduction in memory utilization for 
scalable encoding needs. Yes, dramatic! Some drama IS good! We honor the 
ESAPI Encoder interface and satisfy all existing unit tests for Encoding.

Thank you for this bug report and we will endeavor to move faster in the 
future.

3) New Wiki Design! In an effort to provide a more professional front 
end for the project, we have already implemented the new OWASP wiki 
template that was released a few days ago.
