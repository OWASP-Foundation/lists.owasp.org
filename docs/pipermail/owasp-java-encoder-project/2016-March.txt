Hi,

I need to encode the output of JspWriter.

Owasp - Java Encoder Project
JAR : encoder-1.2.jar

Following is the method which I need to encode

e.g:

private void write(String value) throws JspException {

   try{
out.write(value);
    }catch(IOException e){
    }
}

I have tried to encode the in following ways but none of them works .

Encode.forXML(out, value) - not working (it displays the tags as it is in the browser)
Encode.forHtmlContent(out, value) - not working
Encode.forHtml(out, value) - not working



Thanks,
Gaurav Khanna

Try...

String encodedData = Encode.forHtmlContent(value);
out.write(encodedData);

I have tried the solution you have suggested but it is not working.

The html tags are displayed as text on the browser.

Try...

String encodedData = Encode.forHtmlContent(value);
out.write(encodedData);

Yes, these encoders are not meant to protect HTML markup. The HTML tags 
will be encoded and will be displayed as text in the browser ON PURPOSE 
so they do not execute. This is how you stop XSS.

If you need to accept and render HTML from user sources, use this 
project instead.
