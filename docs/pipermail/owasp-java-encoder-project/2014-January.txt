Hello,



My name is Jim Manico and I am supposedly one of the project managers of
the OWASP Java Encoder project.



I just discovered that not only was I not subscribed to this list (even
though I am the list administrator) but I was not getting bug reports from
Google code emailed to me. Both of these issues are fixed.



We had three active bugs reported on the project that are now being
addressed.



One was reclassified as a document enhancement request and will not block
the next release.
https://code.google.com/p/owasp-java-encoder/issues/detail?id=3



Another was a misunderstanding of the project and was politely rejected.



A third was reported in October 2013 and is rather serious. I am very sorry
that this has not been addressed sooner, it will not happen again.
https://code.google.com/p/owasp-java-encoder/issues/detail?id=4 We are
reviewing Mark?s patch right now and will endeavor to push out a new
official release as soon as possible.



Regards,

Jim Manico

OWASP Board Member
