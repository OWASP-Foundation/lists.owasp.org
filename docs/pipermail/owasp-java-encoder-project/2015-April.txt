Subject: [Owasp-java-encoder-project] OWASP Java Encoder 1.2 release....
Message-ID: <552AC7E1.4090600@owasp.org>

Folks,

First of all thank you to Jeremy Long for moving us to GitHub and 
getting us ready for the 1.2 release.

I just updated the following...

* GitHub readme.md file which you can see here 
https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-java-encoder
* OWASP Wiki pages here: 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project
* Deleted everything from Google Code and pointed up to GitHub 
https://code.google.com/p/owasp-java-encoder/
* Updated the GitHub wiki https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-java-encoder/wiki

CAN YOU PLEASE _*R*__*EVIEW THESE ARTIFACTS*_ BEFORE WE DO A BIG 
ANNOUNCEMENT ON OWASP LEADERS AND COMMUNITY?

THANK YOU!

Aloha,
Jim Manico

So, I don't know if this is a "known failure" or not, but after checking
out the project from github and running "git checkout v1.2 && mvn install"
the project fails to build complaining about esapi classes not existing.

Is there a preferred method here?  Otherwise I was just going to clone
esapi in-place.

 > What canonicalization functions are you thinking of?

Detection of encoded input.

Like if a user took an attack and then URL encoded it and then HTML 
Entity encoded it in an attempt to circumvent filters.

By noticing that input is already decoded - you might want to reject it 
as a form of intrusion detection for certain fields.

So like...

if (rawContent != 
htmlDecode(urlDecode(javascriptDecode(cssDecode(rawContent)))) {
    //we might want to reject this
}

//kindda like this
canonicalize(rawInput) {
   return htmlDecode(urlDecode(javascriptDecode(cssDecode(rawContent))));
}

Aloha,
Jim
