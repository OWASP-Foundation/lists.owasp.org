*MEETING TIME!*

Its that time again here in OKC. I feel ill last meeting but have made lots
of headway on the hive.

Some of the things I would like to talk around is recent events like ADOBE
and how they fail. No zero days came out of this :( ...

THE HIVE its been getting a makeover and I will show you.
https:netgreen.ushas been built.

If anyone else has anything to talk or try we can do that too.
