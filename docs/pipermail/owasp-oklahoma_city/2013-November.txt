Hi All,

How are you?
I haven't been to our chapter meeting for a long time due to conflicts with
other schedules but hope you know I never forget our chapter. ;-)

I met Cassie at InnoTech today. She said she will move to Austin in two
days.
I wish her good luck with her new job and new life in Austin and also your
happy holidays.

Grace

Grace: It was great seeing you today. Thank you for the well wishes and I will certainly keep in touch!

Jason and list: With the new year approaching, it would be a good idea to consider changes for upcoming chapter meetings. I know some of our attendees have schedule conflicts that prevent attendance on Tues/Thurs, and there was also buzz about a potential meeting venue change.

If any of you have preferences regarding meeting dates/times, please send your feedback to Jason Johnson. I'll still be poking my head in (virtually) to assist and will continue to contribute to OWASP in general.

Please keep in touch! I will still be available at Cassie.Park at owasp.org email.

Kind regards,
Cassie Park
