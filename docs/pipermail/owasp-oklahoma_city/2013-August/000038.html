<PRE>Hey all,

I hope this finds you well. This Thursday at 7pm we will have a special
guest, Zak Wolff to present on HTTP header abuse. This will be a great
presentation for builders, breakers, and defenders alike. You'll find the
presentation abstract below. Feel free to invite along anyone that may
benefit from the presentation. As always our meetings are open and free of
charge - membership is not required to attend.

Also, if you had the pleasure of attending Black Hat and/or DEF CON this
past week, we'd love if you'd like to share any information you've learned,
or any presentations our group would find of interest. Jason has some
exciting new progress to share on the HIVE project as well. We can't wait
to see you there!

Adventures In Large Scale HTTP Header Abuse
While the technique of sending malicious data through HTTP Header fields is
not new, there is a conspicuous lack of information on the topic. This
presentation explores research and testing results of random auditing of
1.6 million websites. The speaker will address the history of HTTP Header
attacks, the logic that went into the creation of an HTTP Header Audit
tool, and the most interestingly the findings of the test run. How many
vulnerable websites were discovered? What attacks were they most
susceptible to? Which Header fields are most likely to be vulnerable?
Finally, the presentation will discuss defensive techniques around HTTP
header abuse and how to efficiently audit a sites HTTP Header fields for
vulnerabilities.

8/8 7-9pm
