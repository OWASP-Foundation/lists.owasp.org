Hi OWASP Leaders,

Earlier this month several of the OWASP chapter leads in Canada help an
OWASP Canada [1] meetup which featured multiple host locations and a single
speaker that was live streamed, and supported internet based and location
based audience engagement.

The experience was broadcast via Google Hangouts On Air and streamed live
(and archived) on the OWASP Montreal youtube channel[2].

We thought the experiment was very successful, and although the original
objective was to create a recurring cross-Canada meeting, we realized that
was too limited in scope.

After a couple of discussions Jonathan, myself, and the other Canadian
chapter leads decided it would be worthwhile to put together a regular
monthly chapter call.

This format would provide a regular, streamed opportunity engage the OWASP
community, host speakers from all over the world, and most importantly,
enable true global participation.

The proposed model is a regular meeting with a repeatable structure, that
occurs on the first Wednesday of every month.  In order to ensure a global
reach, these meetings will be scheduled to have a different chapter lead
the meeting each month, and on a monthly basis the chapters will progress
through time zones covered by OWASP chapters, until next August the meetup
returns to PDT.

I realize that OWASP has a webex account and can use that to present to
audiences, but I feel that the requirements for using Google Hangouts are
less onerous (browser+flash+plugin, as opposed to browser+java) and provide
a great deal of flexibility to the partipants, and unless there are
overwhelming objections, I propose to continue using that platform.

At this point I would like to invite chapter leads to visit the newly
created Global Chapter meetup page[3] and review the schedule, and
volunteer (or nominate) to host the monthly meetup.  From there, the OWASP
community can help identify speakers, coordinate physical locations for
meetups where the time zones are compatible, and generally get the ball
rolling.  Over the next couple of iterations of the chapter meetups we can
shake out the technical details and document what is required so that by
the time chapter meetups move out of North American time zones there will
guides and documentation on how to host and run the meetups.

In order to facilitate this, I have taken the liberty of setting up a
Google+ page[4] (and the associated channel).  I can add others managers
for the page as the project grows.  Please let me know if you have any
feedback, are interested in participating as a speaker, host chapter,
online organization, or any other means of getting involved.  There are
only a couple of weeks left until the September 4th meetup, and while I am
happy to speak at the event (redoing the talk I will give at AppSecEU next
week), it would be great to get a speaker who is located in the time zone
engaged!

Cheers,
Yvan Boily &amp; Jonathon Marcil

Please note that using OWASP Montreal's YouTube channel is temporary since
we are looking into making a Global OWASP Channel as another project that
will mix live events and pre-recorded videos.
