Message-ID: <mailman.3248.1391446370.956.owasp-oklahoma_city@lists.owasp.org>

   I think we have much to talk about!

-The HIVE in education

-Team OWASP

-INTERFACE

   Anything anyone else may have? I'm not going to have a speaker but I
will share with everyone how my Introducer for the hive got hacked and
someone put some lovely phishing sites on it. COX went nuts! Who knew a
Beagle Bone Black could upset so many people!


Please let me know if there are any conflicts with the 404, I don't want to
step on other meetings...
