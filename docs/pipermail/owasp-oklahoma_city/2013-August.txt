Hey all,

I hope this finds you well. This Thursday at 7pm we will have a special
guest, Zak Wolff to present on HTTP header abuse. This will be a great
presentation for builders, breakers, and defenders alike. You'll find the
presentation abstract below. Feel free to invite along anyone that may
benefit from the presentation. As always our meetings are open and free of
charge - membership is not required to attend.

Also, if you had the pleasure of attending Black Hat and/or DEF CON this
past week, we'd love if you'd like to share any information you've learned,
or any presentations our group would find of interest. Jason has some
exciting new progress to share on the HIVE project as well. We can't wait
to see you there!

Adventures In Large Scale HTTP Header Abuse
While the technique of sending malicious data through HTTP Header fields is
not new, there is a conspicuous lack of information on the topic. This
presentation explores research and testing results of random auditing of
1.6 million websites. The speaker will address the history of HTTP Header
attacks, the logic that went into the creation of an HTTP Header Audit
tool, and the most interestingly the findings of the test run. How many
vulnerable websites were discovered? What attacks were they most
susceptible to? Which Header fields are most likely to be vulnerable?
Finally, the presentation will discuss defensive techniques around HTTP
header abuse and how to efficiently audit a sites HTTP Header fields for
vulnerabilities.

8/8 7-9pm

Hi OWASP Leaders,

Earlier this month several of the OWASP chapter leads in Canada help an
OWASP Canada [1] meetup which featured multiple host locations and a single
speaker that was live streamed, and supported internet based and location
based audience engagement.

The experience was broadcast via Google Hangouts On Air and streamed live
(and archived) on the OWASP Montreal youtube channel[2].

We thought the experiment was very successful, and although the original
objective was to create a recurring cross-Canada meeting, we realized that
was too limited in scope.

After a couple of discussions Jonathan, myself, and the other Canadian
chapter leads decided it would be worthwhile to put together a regular
monthly chapter call.

This format would provide a regular, streamed opportunity engage the OWASP
community, host speakers from all over the world, and most importantly,
enable true global participation.

The proposed model is a regular meeting with a repeatable structure, that
occurs on the first Wednesday of every month.  In order to ensure a global
reach, these meetings will be scheduled to have a different chapter lead
the meeting each month, and on a monthly basis the chapters will progress
through time zones covered by OWASP chapters, until next August the meetup
returns to PDT.

I realize that OWASP has a webex account and can use that to present to
audiences, but I feel that the requirements for using Google Hangouts are
less onerous (browser+flash+plugin, as opposed to browser+java) and provide
a great deal of flexibility to the partipants, and unless there are
overwhelming objections, I propose to continue using that platform.

At this point I would like to invite chapter leads to visit the newly
created Global Chapter meetup page[3] and review the schedule, and
volunteer (or nominate) to host the monthly meetup.  From there, the OWASP
community can help identify speakers, coordinate physical locations for
meetups where the time zones are compatible, and generally get the ball
rolling.  Over the next couple of iterations of the chapter meetups we can
shake out the technical details and document what is required so that by
the time chapter meetups move out of North American time zones there will
guides and documentation on how to host and run the meetups.

In order to facilitate this, I have taken the liberty of setting up a
Google+ page[4] (and the associated channel).  I can add others managers
for the page as the project grows.  Please let me know if you have any
feedback, are interested in participating as a speaker, host chapter,
online organization, or any other means of getting involved.  There are
only a couple of weeks left until the September 4th meetup, and while I am
happy to speak at the event (redoing the talk I will give at AppSecEU next
week), it would be great to get a speaker who is located in the time zone
engaged!

Cheers,
Yvan Boily & Jonathon Marcil

Please note that using OWASP Montreal's YouTube channel is temporary since
we are looking into making a Global OWASP Channel as another project that
will mix live events and pre-recorded videos.
