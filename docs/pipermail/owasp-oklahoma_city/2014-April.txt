I was curious if there are any security related companies that you all may
know of that would provide internship opportunities for students?

Thanks for the question, Jason.

Hi all, I am planning to write a thorough academic paper on defending
against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities this summer.
The OWASP Top 10 is nothing new but academia is a way behind in teaching
the subject, though not in research.
Any inputs related to industry practice is welcome.

I am also planning to write a paper w.r.t security policy in higher
education.
I was on the task force team for UCO information security policy team and
found difficulty in writing a good policy without having a security policy
expert.

Do you know anybody who is an expert in security policy?
I would like to have meetings with an expert before starting a paper.
Though the business environment might be different, overall approach will
be the same, I guess.
