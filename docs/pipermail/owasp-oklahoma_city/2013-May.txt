KICKOFF TIME Tomorrow!!!!

This is a reminder that at 7:00pm tomorrow the 15th Wednesday @ the 404 in Oklahoma City we are going to meet and talk about OWASP.

I was going to make a slide show and bore the living crap out of everyone, but I am not going to do that. I have a few things to show everyone, and Cassie may have some things also. If anyone has something they want to bring up to the group we can do that too. I want to give everyone an overview of OWASP and answer questions if any.

This is OPEN to anything anyone and always free...


I have some very exciting things that are coming up. I have a project that I want to introduce to OWASP OKC  in hopes to develop it further. OWASP Hive Project! more details to come. 

Thank you all... OWASP is nothing without the support of its members.

Jason, Heads up the weather is looking a little sketchy today so I may not drive up from Tulsa tonight. Larry. 
BTW I am the project support person for the Code Review Project 2.0 so I was hoping to give a shout-out about that tonight. This is a flagship OWASP project. If anyone has any questions we are still looking for authors and reviewers. Please contact me if anyone wants to help out this important project and fun project.  Larry.conklin at owasp.org

I am working on a IMG. I really want to include a version of WebGoat on
this. I got it working what I would like to do is create IMG's one would be
a clustered IMG so that a massive amount of PIES can operate as one.
Somehow I would like to be able to switch between this mode. So at any time
you can have 20 separate environments in the HIVE or one big HIVE with 20
ARM cpu's and 10gig of ram. This is Phase 3...

-The IMG is built off of PWNPI its a stripped down wheezy running OPENBOX
for the VM experience.


*Phase 1* establish funding and order the pies and cases for them. The HIVE
case will be manufactured from a laser cut acrylic. Create the IMG
final version 1.0 for the PI's.

*Phase 2* Build out of the HIVE itself power supply to power 20+ PI's and a
wireless router for the PI's to connect to. With the HIVE running you can
issue IP's to the groups for a environment all there own to play on.
(everyone wants to hack each others PI's) to keep sanity you can add or
remove them from the subdomians they are in. The main part of this phase is
to explore the possibility to allow the trainer or HOST to have access (ssh
or more) into all the OWASPi's <------cool name

*Phase 3* Give this thing to everyone!!!! I would like to find a way to
offer this at a LOW LOW cost so if we can produce this to cost less then
50$ thats a huge win but it seems 75$ is more realistic. You have the PI
itself that 35$ power adapter 5$ sd card 4gb 10$ and then a case 12$ Then a
HDMI cable DVI to HDMI 20$.

I'm the sole idea holder for OWASPi <--- COOOL name so anyone that wants to
team up to make this happen please help. I have two PI's right now that I'm
working on we need more to really proof this concept out. I hope the
funding goes through, if not I will find other means. My passion for this
project is driven from the ability to offer people something they can say
OHHH THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. and be able to test other attacks or even build
in safeguards. If something like this was around years ago I know my Pizza
delivery job could buy me one because my parents thought my computer
addiction was bad for my health. This has to happen... Every chapter needs
a HIVE!!! after all we are OWASP!

P.S.

Oklahoma metro was hit with a nasty round of tornado's. My family and
myself are all safe I hope the rest of the OKC Chapter is safe and there
families are safe also. My thoughts go out to the families in MOORE and the
parents, friends, children that lost there lives. Oklahoma is strong and we
will get through this.  [?]

Much Love
