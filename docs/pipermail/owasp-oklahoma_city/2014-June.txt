Subject: [Owasp-oklahoma_city] OWASP Build server test
Message-ID: <mailman.853.1403540351.1070.owasp-oklahoma_city@lists.owasp.org>

I am looking for code to build in OWASP build server for a test. I know
some of our apps have some dependencies and I would like to test a JAVA app
and a .NET app. If anyone has a suggestion or would like to help please let
me know. The server is running i just have a few more things to add and we
can test some builds.


Thanks

Jason
