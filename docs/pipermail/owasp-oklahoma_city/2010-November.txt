Hi

HP recently acquired Fortify Software and we are looking to hire several Application Security Consultants throughout the central US.

In short, we are looking for Application Security Consultants who can quickly become Fortify Tool Experts to support our client base.

Enjoy the stability, career path and benefits of the FORTUN 9 company, but still work in a flexible, nimble software type company.

Additional Positions in Chicago, NYC, San Francisco

Please send your resume directly to my attention.

Our conversation will be kept confidential.
