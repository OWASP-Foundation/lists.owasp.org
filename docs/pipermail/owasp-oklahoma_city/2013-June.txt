Message-ID: <mailman.4813.1370961718.2548.owasp-oklahoma_city@lists.owasp.org>

Dear Leaders and everyone,

   Before I start the v 1.0 of this HIVE project I have been up at night
thinking about how to power this and also cluster configuration. I found
out that BeagleBone is back and its BLACK. Now im torn... On one hand I
like RaspberryPI for one thing only. PRICE...Now beaglebone is just 10$
more and with x2 the processing power. It also has micro everything
USB,HDMI,SD-CARD... So RaspberryPI 35 - BeagleBone 45

   My question to you all is what to do? Should I stay with the RaspberryPI
or use BeagleBone? I think the beaglebone could be better is some aspects
because in testing SIEGE tests could only go up to around 75 users but this
is 2x faster and we all know more power means better experiences. Also they
place the chips better so less heat it may last longer.


I want to get this project out ASAP but I also want quality. If I slap a
OWASP logo on it I want it to last for years. Maybe I should test them both
side by side? I do not want to order 10 RaspberryPI's and then down the
road think damn I should have bought the BeagleBone for this project.

The thread
 http://www.element14.com/community/thread/23575

This is what it looks like. (One key feature is the shield adapter....So we
can develop hack shilds or hardware firewalls)

Use the help of a few other OWASP people with this, thats why the community is out there. Doing something huge alone is a real pain.

Jason,

<2?>

The idea is just plain awesome! There is a lot of hype around the 
RaspberryPI and it seems like everybody has one or can get one; so it 
seems like that would make it more accessible, more hackable and it is 
cheaper.

However, the BeagleBone is a better engineered product. BeagleBoard is 
much better suited for Real-Time linux and in the end this will be a 
giant advantage for any realtime analysis which will no doubt take 
place. I think thus, BeagleBone:

1) better engineered
2) likely to last longer 'in-field' due to #1
3) better suited for realtime linux
4) investment over time likely to be better due to #3

</2?>

Note: I have been wrong before :-)

It's very simple in my mind.  If you don't need and never desire Video why pay for the chip.

Thanks for the info on beaglebone.
I wish I could know about RP and BB better so that I can give you an input.
But I might later as I study more.

By the way, I was thinking about possible topics for the Thursday meeting.
Since I don't know the backgrounds of our members, I'd better wait until I
find something that benefits the members.
See you on Thursday. I will be late about 30 min due to an evening class.

It's funny you say that, when I read about your project I also thought, humm Jason should also try the BeagleBone since the latest models seem a lot like the RPI (like the linked article shows)

Now I have a couple RPIs in my house and they are pretty cool devices, I made an order the other day for a BeagleBone so I'll let you know my feedback on it.

Another option is the really interesting/powerful http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/435742530/udoo-android-linux-arduino-in-a-tiny-single-board (I'm a backer and should get one eventually). But I'm not sure when that is going to be out

Regarding the RPI and BeagleBone, Jason, can't you prototype with both? :)

Other interesting cheap devices out there with CPU power and code execution are the multiple Arduino boards and the new Android-powered-mini-devices (like the Justop http://www.justop.com )

Since I don't know the backgrounds of our members, I'd better wait until I
find something that benefits the members.
See you on Thursday. I will be late about 30 min due to an evening class.
Thanks,

Grace

Hi Jason and all other members,

I have just started to write a grant proposal which will be submitted to
National Science Foundation next March.
The proposal is about train high-school students and teachers on security
and mobile apps in order to expand future workforce in that area.
I am thinking about incorporating HIVE project into the proposal.

Thanks Jason for a valuable approach and I am looking forward to any input
and brainstorming as our chapter moves along.

This is outstanding we can work together and come up with a solid plan to
facilitate the requirements.
