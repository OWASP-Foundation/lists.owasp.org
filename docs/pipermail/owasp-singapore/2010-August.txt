Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Topics for our monthly meetups
Message-ID: <4C57ED3D.9040504@usa.net>

 Hi folks,

As discussed in our meetup yesterday, we will be having regular monthly
meetings, regardless whether there is a speaker.
We will be adopting a panel discussion format where all attendees can
have a chance to share with the rest.
Whenever there is a suitable speaker for a shortlisted topic, I will
definitely try to arrange for the speaker to present.

As such, I will like to hear from you on your preferred list of topics.
Do email me privately your preferred list so as not to spam the entire
group.
The most popular topics will be given higher priority and will be
organised at earlier dates.

Due to dynamic developments in IS, I will also be polling the group
every quarter to make sure the list of topics is constantly kept fresh
and relevant.

Hope to hear from you soon.
Thanks!

PS: Please DO NOT reply to the group with your preferred list of topics.

Onn Chee

Onn Chee,

Given the centralised monoculture that is IT in Singapore, combined with the
banks? (and Government?s) general attitudes, I?m amazed that it hasn?t
happened already... if it truly hasn?t.

There are flaws in any system. When an excessively large proportion of a
critically important industry (like, say, finance) is dependent upon a
single system with minor-at-best variation, the when-not-if meter goes to
11....especially in a top-down, reactive management environment.
Unfortunately, there?s only so much of the problem that can be solved by
technical means within the status quo otherwise.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] New Meetup: Sep 2010 Meetup: A New Path to Web
 Application Security: The end of consultancy?
Message-ID: <4C68DB23.80403@usa.net>

 Announcing a new Meetup for The Singapore Security Meetup Group / OWASP
Singapore!

*What*: Sep 2010 Meetup: A New Path to Web Application Security: The end
of consultancy? <http://www.meetup.com/SGSecurityMG/calendar/14435268/>

*When*: Thursday, September 9, 2010 7:00 PM

*Where*: Cairnhill Community Club
1 Anthony Road Room #03-05
Singapore
98387930

Web applications are more pervasive than ever and business owners are
always trying to out-do one another by improving functionality and
enabling greater business interaction with their customer base in order
to save money or find new sources of revenue. As they steam ahead, web
applications are oftentimes secured as an after thought rather than as
part of the development lifecycle. This is good news for consultants who
specialize in application vulnerability assessment services because
there is a continuous stream of work. But companies are realizing that
the consultancy approach does not scale and that scanning tools are
approaching the depth of what a consultant can do. Does continuous
improvement in scanning technology and SaaS offerings spell the end of
the consultancy approach? Can the tools possibly achieve the same depth
and cost-effectively scale across the enterprise? Are there hybrid
approaches that offer the best of both worlds? Attend this presentation
to discover the answers to these questions and more.

Speaker:
Claudio Scarabello, Global Product Manager

Personal Biography:
Claudio Scarabello is a Product Manager with Verizon Business
specialised in IT risk and compliance management methodologies. As an
articulate speaker and educator, he has been involved in information
security markets around the globe since 1996 and is currently
responsible for solutions focused on application security. Currently
based in Singapore, he previously spent over 6 years in Brussels
managing European responsibilities and had North American roles based in
Toronto, Canada.

Time is ripe for security folks to be software experts.
Else how can we, as security pros, expect to catch software bugs?

Friends who know me for long will find my statement above very familiar
(and sound like a broken record).
To date, I am still waiting for someone to convince me that security
vulnerabilities are not caused by poor software.

So friends, it is time to pick up the Dummies Guide on how to write codes!

Cheers!

Anton, I like what you suggested.

We should have a "Beautiful Code" series of programming books.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Just for fun: Comparison of our local banks' SSL
 strength vs SingPass' SSL strength
Message-ID: <4C74E7E6.2080806@usa.net>

 Hi folks,

These are the screenshots from the Calomel SSL validation add-on for
Firefox.
Now, as an end user, you can visually see the SSL quality of the
"secure" sites you are visiting.

Screenshots of DBS, UOB, OCBC and SingPass are included for your review.
Accordingly to the Calomel report, in descending order of SSL strength:

1) SingPass - Best of 4 (green - 100%)
2) DBS (blue - 72%)
3) OCBC and UOB (orange - 48%)

Hmmm....did not realise OCBC and UOB are using RC4 symmetric encryption
in their SSL....

Any one who can share these findings with OCBC and UOB?

Onn Chee

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Firefox, uTorrent,
 and PowerPoint hit by Windows DLL bug. - Plenty more where that
 came from
Message-ID: <4C75EAE5.2080301@usa.net>

 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/24/windows_dll_casualties/

"Microsoft said on Monday that the flaw stems from applications that
don't explicitly state the full path name of DLL files and other
binaries associated with the program. As a result, *each application
will have to be patched separately*, rather than there being a single
Windows update."

Wow! God bless all Windows security administrators.

A reminder - this is not a Microsoft vulnerability (pending more info on
claims of "affected" MS software).

Guess our fellow Windows admins will be busy patching all the 3rd-party
Windows apps till end of the year.

All thanks to poor coding practices.

Again.

Sign.... :-(

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Security concern on IE8 session merging
Message-ID: <AANLkTinkxgf1N-G9LTy+k-vixhKBRqUmLs-PiJQ_wMFe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I just recently came to know about IE8 session merging behavior. I
tried to look for more info if this was already highlighted/addressed
from a web vulnerability assessment perspective, but couldn't find
anything substantial so far. Does anyone nowadays check for HTML5
sessionStorage usage for authenticating a session during their
assessments, i.e. does anyone see this as a requirement?

A simple example would be:
1. Attacker gains access to unlocked machine.
2. Open IE.
2. Create a WSH script e.g. C:\test.js containing the following
WScript.CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")
3. Run it, then delete it.
4. Close IE, leave and wait.

The script will make one hidden IE instance to make non-persistent
cookies maintained even when user doesn't specifically asks for it
("Keep me logged in" checkbox).

Any input, especially when it comes to an assessment?

Regards,
G. Tanuel
