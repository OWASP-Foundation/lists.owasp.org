<PRE>Hi everyone,

As mentioned in Thursday's meetup, my company has set up a &quot;Stomp-like&quot;
site, &quot;Because I Matter&quot; @ <A HREF="http://community.resolvo.com,">http://community.resolvo.com,</A> for IS pros and
even general public to disclose and share infosec incidents. For those
of us who find that there is no avenue to raise your concerns about IS
matters here in Singapore, &quot;Because I Matter&quot; is for you. Feel free to
share pictures or video demos of any security issues on this community site.

We also welcome people who are interested to become group moderators and
help to drive awareness in a specific area of IS.

Do note there is some proper rules to adhere to while sharing
- no exact URL or personal info should be exposed in full, though the
identity of organisation can be disclosed.
- use layman terms and include pictures or videos as much as possible as
the non-IS-trained, general public may be reading the site.

Lastly, this site should not be a replica of CERT sites where
vulnerabilities are disclosed in very technical terms.
However, if some one have pictures or videos of how the vulnerabilities
can manifest, they are welcome to post such content to help educate the
public.

Hope to see all of you coming on board to build the Singapore's first
online voice for IS folks.

Let the world hears us speak!

Cheers!
Onn Chee
