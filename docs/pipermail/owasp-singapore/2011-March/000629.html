*Singapore&#8217;s 1^st Cyber Security Awareness Day*

Singapore&#8217;s 1^st Cyber Security Awareness Day will be launched on 13
April 2011, in conjunction with the Information Security Seminar 2011
(13 &#8211; 14 April 2011), jointly organised by the Infocomm Development
Authority of Singapore (IDA), Association of Information Security
Professionals (AISP) and Cyber Security Awareness Alliance (Alliance).
While various awareness outreach efforts are carried out throughout the
year, the Awareness Day will serve as a nation-wide call-to-action to
take personal responsibility to &#8220;Go safe online&#8221;.

The target is to draw at least 200,000 users to &#8220;pledge&#8221; to change their
passwords to a strong password on the Awareness Day. For the build-up,
we are reaching out to the public, private and people sectors to raise
awareness and obtain their pledges. In addition, objective of the
Awareness Day and relevant security messages will be published on
traditional prints and online media to heighten the importance of cyber
security leading to the launch of the Awareness Day.

As users of infocomm technologies, we hope that you will respond to the
call-to-action on Cyber Security Awareness Day, by submitting your
pledge to the Alliance secretariat (i.e. <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-singapore">cordelia_chee at ida.gov.sg</A>
&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-singapore">cordelia_chee at ida.gov.sg</A>&gt;via the pledge form) by _18 March
2011_. Your assistance is also sought to help to spread the message and
encourage your business associates, family and friends to respond to the
call-to-action.

As infocomm becomes increasingly pervasive, it is imperative to raise
the awareness and adoption of essential cyber security practices among
users. Well-informed users will not only keep personal / organisation
assets and information secure but will also help to improve the overall
security of cyberspace. We look forward to your favourable reply. Thank you.
