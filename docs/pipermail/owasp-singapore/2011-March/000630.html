<PRE>Hi folks,

Again, there are 2 free complimentary passes to paid, registered OWASP
SG members for the upcoming ISS event by IDA!
No reason not to become a OWASP member again. :-)

The free passes will be given to OWASP SG members on a first-come,
first-serve basis.
Please drop me a note informing me of your wish to obtain the free pass.
Priority will be given to those who did not enjoy free passes before for
earlier events supported by OWASP.

Even if you do not get the free passes, you can enjoy affiliates prices
when registering for this event via their website.

So if you are not a OWASP member, sign up now.
The price is only US$50.
And the benefits you get from your OWASP membership are worth than US$50.

PS: Do check out their website at <A HREF="http://www.aisp.org.sg/iss2011/">http://www.aisp.org.sg/iss2011/</A> for
the program.

 

 

 

Charting New Frontiers, Information Security as an Enabler

 

/*G*//*uest of Honor -- Mr Lui Tuck Yew, Minister for Information,
Communications and the Arts*/

Amidst the global backdrop of emerging infocomm security threats,
governments and organisations around the world are undergoing conceited
developments to enhance their infocomm security strategies. On the local
front, the Singapore Government has been proactive and innovative in our
approach to strengthen our infocomm security capabilities. 

The theme for this year's Seminar is &quot;Charting New Frontiers,
Information Security as an Enabler&quot; and centres on public, private and
people sector collaboration in enhancing our capabilities to prepare
Singapore against new and emerging infocomm security threats.
Singapore's 1st Cyber Security Awareness Day will also be launched, in
conjunction with the Information Security Seminar 2011. While we have
various outreach efforts throughout the year, the Awareness Day serves
as a nation-wide call to action to take personal responsibility to &quot;Go
safe online&quot;.
