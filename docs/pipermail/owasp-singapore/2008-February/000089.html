<PRE>It seems that a lot of people are buying into the Valentine day
frenzy, but I see that at least some of you will be joining us
tonight. I want to discuss the latest news from EFF where two
interesting cases has come up:
- US Customs allegedly search through your computer for files and copy
stuff off it
- An suspect, allegedly had illegal material on his computer, is using
the 5th amendment to prevent law enforcement officers to force him to
reveal the password to the encrypted drive

And as we are talking about encryption, I'll show you how to use
TrueCrypt to provide plausible deniability to protect your data from
snooping.

I am also interested in Security Metrics, if anyone got any
information to share please do so.

Best regards
 Michael Boman
