<PRE>*Data breach alerts linked to increased risk of ID theft*
<A HREF="http://www.scmagazineus.com/Data-breach-alerts-linked-to-increased-risk-of-ID-theft/article/156376/">http://www.scmagazineus.com/Data-breach-alerts-linked-to-increased-risk-of-ID-theft/article/156376/</A>

&quot;The survey also found that despite the fact that those who received a
notification letter were four times more likely to experience fraud,
*/just two percent of identity theft victims/* attributed the fraud to
the data breach, the study found. &quot;

Vamosi said that this finding could indicate a &quot;/*disconnect*/ between
breach notification and consumer understanding of the consequences.&quot;


Onn Chee's view:

When you were notified your identity was leaked due to a data leak, why
wouldn't you attribute subsequent frauds with your stolen identity to
the leak?

Are consumers becoming like characters in Dumb and Dumber????

That is getting beyond my comprehension....
