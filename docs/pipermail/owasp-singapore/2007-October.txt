Hi,
This is Rick. Is this list still alive? It seems the local OWASP chapter is
quite dead while Web Application security is the current "in" thing of the
IT Security world? Should we do something about it?

regards,
Rick Zhong

Hey Rick,
   Thanks for shouting.  Are you a security expert or professional ? 
What do you do ? Are you in Singapore ? Can we meet for a coffee ? 
Anyone else interested  ?

Count me in too. What's the difference if one is a "security expert"
or "professional"? And how would you define the two of them?

Best regards

I was wondering if he is a hobbyist like me or paid professional .  I 
should have stated it more clearly. Sorry about that.
Can we meet sometime this week end ? I'm ok with any time during week 
ends and evenings during week days. Are you guys interested ?
I'm also give a talk on Web Security in Singapore Linux Meetup this 
month and also at OSDC Australia.

Hi everyone,

Can I suggest  to catch up in the Raffles Place Park Coffee Club
restaurant on a weekday evening next week?

We have 25 recipients in the Singapore mailing list.
So if 25 of us are coming, we will need a much bigger space.

Cheers
Onn Chee

Hi guys
Nice to see all the replies and a lot of old friends in this list as well
...  How about next Tuesday (9 Oct) at Geek Terminal (
http://www.geekterminal.com) at 7:00pm?  Just make it a gathering to get to
know each other and see what can we do as a OWASP local chapter.

BTW  I am  working in Raffles area.. so  we can always meet for lunch  if
you guys are happened to be around the area.

regards,
Rick

talk on security ? Or can we have a BOF or something relating to security ?
Regards
Deepan

I can share with you my "Overcoming USB (In)Security" presentation
which I am presenting on the 24th at the NextGen CyberCrime Conference
here in Singapore. And get into the details on how to convert your
U3-enabled usb drive to a automated hacking tool... I missed the last
meeting due to other commitments.

Best regards
 Michael Boman

I would be very interested in hearing about your MMORPG research.

Anyone got any ideas for venue? I believe GeekTerminal has meeting
rooms, but anyone got anything on the cheep? For for us old SIG^2
members, can we try to get something from IDA?

I'd say we go for it. If we fill the room (8-9 ppl) it will be about
$5 a head per hour. It's certainly within my budget. How long do we
need the meeting room? I suggest we just use it for the presentation
itself and then we can do Q&A and BOF at the standard coffee tables,
what do you think? I can do my slot in 20 minutes, leaving the demos
to coffee section afterwards. Of course it only works if we are all
punctual.
