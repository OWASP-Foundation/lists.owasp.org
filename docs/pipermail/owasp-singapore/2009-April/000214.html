<PRE>Hi folks,

Kudos to Jackson!
This is our first leakage bust since the portal went live -
<A HREF="http://www.infothatmatter.org/forum/topics/disclosure-of-personal">http://www.infothatmatter.org/forum/topics/disclosure-of-personal</A>
As per our code of ethics and being a responsible portal, the identity
of LTA was not revealed until the leak was removed.

LTA was informed promptly about this leak and the private information
was subsequently cleaned up (within half a day which is very fast in
garmen terms).
I will like to give special credit to Vincent Leong and Faisal Mohammad
of LTA for their prompt action.

This is what this portal is about, folks!
:<i>-)
</I>
I hope more of you can contribute to this portal to make our online
world a safer place.
Cheers and have a nice weekend.


Regards
Onn Chee

</PRE>
