<PRE>Hi folks,

After the recent NUS email accident, it seems like the NUS staff / students are also equally guilty of not protecting their own private info.
You can refer to
<A HREF="http://www.infothatmatter.org/forum/topics/selfleakages-on-nus-website-by">http://www.infothatmatter.org/forum/topics/selfleakages-on-nus-website-by</A>
for more info.

(PS: These are just tip of the iceberg and the NUS School of Computing is already informed about this.)

If you ask me, the leakage of medical records of 1 person is more sensitive than the leakage of 15700 contact info in the earlier NUS
email accident.
(I feel sad for the person after reading the diagnosis)

As the above item shows, even individuals themselves can be as guilty as the service providers.

Cheers!
Onn Chee
