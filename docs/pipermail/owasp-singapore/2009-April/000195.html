&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned in Thursday's meetup, my company has set up a &quot;Stomp-like&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> site, &quot;Because I Matter&quot; @ <A HREF="http://community.resolvo.com,">http://community.resolvo.com,</A> for IS pros and
</I>&gt;<i> even general public to disclose and share infosec incidents. For those
</I>&gt;<i> of us who find that there is no avenue to raise your concerns about IS
</I>&gt;<i> matters here in Singapore, &quot;Because I Matter&quot; is for you. Feel free to
</I>&gt;<i> share pictures or video demos of any security issues on this community site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also welcome people who are interested to become group moderators and
</I>&gt;<i> help to drive awareness in a specific area of IS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do note there is some proper rules to adhere to while sharing
</I>&gt;<i> - no exact URL or personal info should be exposed in full, though the
</I>&gt;<i> identity of organisation can be disclosed.
</I>&gt;<i> - use layman terms and include pictures or videos as much as possible as
</I>&gt;<i> the non-IS-trained, general public may be reading the site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, this site should not be a replica of CERT sites where
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities are disclosed in very technical terms.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if some one have pictures or videos of how the vulnerabilities
</I>&gt;<i> can manifest, they are welcome to post such content to help educate the
</I>&gt;<i> public.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope to see all of you coming on board to build the Singapore's first
</I>&gt;<i> online voice for IS folks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let the world hears us speak!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!
