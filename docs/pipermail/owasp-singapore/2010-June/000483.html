<PRE><A HREF="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/061710-ipv4-addresses.html?source=NWWNLE_nlt_security_2010-06-21">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/061710-ipv4-addresses.html?source=NWWNLE_nlt_security_2010-06-21</A>


  Run on IPv4 addresses could exhaust supply by December


IANA tracks IPv4 address space in blocks of 16 million addresses, which
are known in network engineering parlance as a &quot;/8.&quot; At the beginning of
2010, IANA had 26 /8s left. Currently, IANA has 16 /8s remaining
unallocated.

&quot;We've gone through 10 /8s since the beginning of this year,&quot; Jimmerson
says. &quot;To put that in perspective, in all of 2009, we only went through
eight /8s. It's very possible that the IANA free pool will deplete in
December or January at the earliest.&quot;

One reason that unallocated IPv4 address space could be depleted this
year is that IANA has a policy that states that when there are only five
remaining /8s, it will automatically give one to each of the registries
and thereby deplete the free pool overnight.

&quot;When we get down to seven /8s, it could be a matter of days for us to
get from seven to zero,&quot; Jimmerson says. &quot;Once ARIN gets its final /8,
our pool could last anywhere from one day to six months, depending on
demand...The minute that carriers hear the IANA free pool has been
depleted, ISPs will be sure to get their requests in.&quot;
