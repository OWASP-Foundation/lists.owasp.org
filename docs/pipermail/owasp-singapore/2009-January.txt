Hi Stephen,

I'm pretty surprised by your response. The Servlet spec is a framework of
sorts actually. I think figuring out what level(s) to focus on is a good
discussion for the leaders list. The details below we can take to the Java
list if you want to go into more detail there.

Here are the items I've been working  on. Let me know if you think these
should be in Servlet or in a framework.

1) Disallow CR and LF in all HTTP headers. This will stop all
response-splitting/tunneling and file download injection attacks.

2) Disallow unlisted http-methods in security-constraints. This prevents the
bypass of authentication and access control by using verbs like HEAD, JEFF,
etc...

3) Provide support for a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) token. Would
require a token for any pages with a security-constraint in web.xml.

4) Enable HttpOnly flag on JSESSIONID. To prevent one bad consequence of
XSS.

5) Add a security note to 7.1.3 URL Rewriting. Originally I wanted this
removed, but they said no way. This method puts ;jessionid=9823429347 on the
URL.

6) Encoding/escaping support. To make it easy to properly escape data for
the appropriate HTML context.

--Jeff

I think trying to get web security issues addressed in the servlet  
spec is aiming at too low a level.  You might have better luck with  
web frameworks projects instead.  Similarly with Ruby, the language  
itself is too low level, but getting security features added to the  
Rails framework might be more feasible.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] PCI does not require end-to-end encryption within
	private networks??
Message-ID: <497FED0A.90006@usa.net>

Hi folks,

For those who are more familiar with PCI-DSS, are the claims below
correct - that PCI-DSS does not require end-to-end encryption within
private networks?

http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/012209-heartland-breach.html?hpg1=bn

"Billions is being spent on PCI compliance, but it isn't really
working," says Gartner analyst Avivah Litan. "PCI's dirty little secret
is that it doesn't mandate encryption inside a private network because
then all the processors would have to encrypt."

Regards
Onn Chee
