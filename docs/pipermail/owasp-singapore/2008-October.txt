Hello OWASP Leaders

If you are from the "old school" or are in contact with classic ASP
applications, you might be interested in this training course at
OWASP-Summit. Classic ASP 2.0 and 3.0 applications are still largely
used as this technology is more than 10 years old and was largely used.
there are thousands of sites on the wild that need guidance on the
security arena. This is where OWASP can come up and provide help for
?making the Web a better place?.

This 1 day training session will be held on Monday Nov 3rd. You will
learn how to develop, test and protect Classic ASP applications using
well known OWASP tools, these are the main topics:

    * Secure programming on ASP using OWASP ESAPI
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI> (All the Top 10 domains are
      covered)
    * Auditing ASP code with Code Review Project
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project>
      checklist
    * Implementing OWASP Stinger
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Stinger_Project>
      protection for Classic ASP
    * Complementary security best practices.

If you are interested or want more info about the course feel free to
reply back to me

Also feel free to distribute this email to others or send them the
course link

Juan Carlos
