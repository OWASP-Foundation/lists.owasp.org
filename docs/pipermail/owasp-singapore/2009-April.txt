Hi Dick,

Can I assume the Taiwanese company is Amrorize and the local partner is
MTech?

For the rest, Wayne, the OWASP Taiwan chapter leader, founded Armorize
(http://www.armorize.com) and has been organising OWASP Asia Conference
for past 2 years.

May I know who is coming down from Armorize?

Dear Onn Chee,
?
Yes, the team was here yesterday. But they have a packed schedule in this trip. Benson whom I spoke to said they would not mind meeting us the next time.
?
He will liaise with me if they have any plan of coming to Singapore again.

Hi SGNIC administrator,

As a concerned Singapore citizen, I will like to highlight that the
above domain name - www.posbank.com.sg which is not related to DBS/POSB,
is easy to be confused with the actual POSB domain - www.posb.com.sg

Fortunately, this site is not used for phishing purpose.
If it were, with its very similar domain name, it would have a high
success rate in tricking innocent visitors.

Appreciate your further attention.
Thanks.

Hi Frenky,

Thanks for the insight.

Perhaps someone from DBS/POSB should take this up.

Any group member from DBS?

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Question on Application Security Assessment
Message-ID: <BAY118-W5CDAB0ED5A076DECF0713F47F0@phx.gbl>


Hi All,
 
Need some help from the experts as Im relatively new to Application Security. Im also relatively new member of OWASP Singapore and Security Meet Up group. Though not active as I would like to but following the discussion in the mail group intently.
 
Anyway, I need some input from the experts here on doing security assessment of an existing application. I have created a framework which mainly comes from OWASP testing guide version 3. See below. Any comments/feedback or suggestions? Please HELP!!!! As I want to make this assessment a success.  Not to mention that this could mean a make or break for my career in the company. 
 
Regards,
Ruel Montallana
 
 
Information Gathering


Documentation review (support documentation, design or blueprint, architecture, code) -  Gathering all available documentation and ensuring that they have been updated. This is to ensure that support of the application can be done even without the principal support or developer. Moreover, reviewing all artifacts/documentation we will be able to visually identify potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors.
 


Technology review (all technologies used including linkages being used to other systems, versions of technology) -  Identifying the technologies used (e.g. language, version, etc). This is to ensure that the application is able to adapt changes to technologies, etc.

 


Security Requirements -  The security requirements will help in identifying and eliminating potential application vulnerabilities and security flaws. They are designed to address known application vulnerabilities. The security requirements will also form the basis of the security test plan.
 


Threat Modelling (identification of threat vectors) -  This is used to identify the threat vectors of an application. Meaning, the reasons for attack and the methods that an attacker would use to identify vulnerabilities or threat in the system. 
 


Code/Funtionality walkthrough -  Walkthrough of the main code elements/functionality. This will help all stakeholders understand the main code elements and identify areas where extra security should be implemented. This will also show if there are unnecessary code elements which should and can be removed from the code.  The purpose is not to perform a code review, but to understand at a high level the flow, the layout, and the structure of the code that makes up the application.
 
Formal Security Testing


Develop Security Test script (based on security requirements) - Developing a test plan based on the identified security requirements
 


Security Testing - Validating that the security requirements has been implemented appropriately.
 


Penetration Testing -  This is a method of evaluating the security of an application by simulating an attack. The process involves an analysis of the application for any weaknesses, technical flaws, or vulnerabilities. Will be focusing on testing the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities.

Hi Ruel,

I would remove "Develop Security Test script (based on security
requirements)"; developing a test plan is OK but I've never developed
any scripts in the 5+ years that I have been doing this stuff.

Your list is very comprehensive but what you will actually do is
dependent on what the development team has done and can provide you.
Rarely do security requirements exist but you can make a check list
via interviews and from company security policies, guidelines, and
procedures (if they exist).

At the very least, a pentest is done. If you have a checklist of
security requirements, then a pentest becomes a security assessment
(the 2 terms are used almost interchangeably in APAC, along with "risk
assessment" which you want to avoid like the plague :-)

Of course, if the code is available then do a code review if time permits.

Threat modeling is something every good pentester does mentally for
preparation, but be careful about committing to a written threat model
- it's very time-consuming.

To sum it up, it all depends on the time you have and what your
company wants to do. If you have a year or more, take a look at the
OWASP SAMM project (software maturity model) headed up by Pravir
Chandra.

Hope this helps,
Stephen

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Further refinements to the code of ethics for
 disclosure portal - www.infothatmatter.org
Message-ID: <49E2DB87.8000908@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Just received a "friendly" phone call from one of the schools who was
responsible for leaking students info.
Guess the ST article managed to kick someone into action.
Interestingly, the school was not mentioned in the ST article, but was
highlighted on www.infothatmatter.org

Their feedback is that too much information was disclosed.
I believe another member has replied with similar feedback too.

As this is our first attempt in setting proper disclosure standards and
we do honestly want to protect the privacy of affected individuals, we
will like to seek your opinion on the following refinements to the Code
of Ethics:

1) No disclosure of phone number - to avoid harassing calls

2) No disclosure of email address - to avoid spams

3) Partial disclosure of last 4 digits and alphabet checksum in NRIC -
this is to allow the affected individuals to quietly identify themselves

4) Partial disclosure of day and month in date of birth - again, this is
to allow the affected individuals to quietly identify themselves


The above refinements are on top of the existing restrictions such as no
names, no home address and no URL.

If you feel that there is more to be done to protect the public, feel
free to voice it out.

This portal - www.infothatmatter.org - was created for you to have a voice.
So do let us hear you. :-)

Thanks.

Regards
Onn Chee

Hi Ruel,

Can I assume that this is a web-based application?
Cos OWASP Testing Guide will be more applicable to web-based
applications than client-side applications.

Just want to highlight that without knowing the context and type of
application, the best that we, in the community, can do is to make
general comments, without any specific applicability. We also understand
that you can't disclose too much, hence do take what you hear from us
with a huge tablespoon of salt. ;-)

At the end of the day, you have to decide what is applicable and what is
not for your company.
That's the hallmark of a good infosec pro.

Just my 0.02.

Hi folks,

Got a call from SGNIC.
Frenky is right.

Their stand is unless DBS/POSB complains, they will register the domains
on a first-come-first-serve basis.

I further asked if a company other than OCBC register this domain -
www.ocbcbank.com.sg, will SGNIC allow.
The answer is yes.

Folks, not sure whether you agree with me, but something in my gut is
telling me that something is not right here.
Don't you agree?

Anyone from OCBC or DBS/POSB who cares to share your view?

Hi Francis,

Well said. :-)

Just want to clarify that I am referring to just .com.sg domains, not
.com domains.

In Singapore, I believe that everyone will assume posbank.com.sg as POSB
and ocbcbank.com.sg as OCBC
I may be wrong and stand to be corrected.

At the end of the day, you are right.
I have no better suggestion, as SGNIC is not equipped to decide on
intellectual property overlaps.

Only thing I can think of is to mimic what ACRA or ROS does when
allowing companies or societies to register.
>From my experience, even when one is registering a society with ROS, ROS
will do a check with ACRA for similar sounding names too.

If SGNIC can do something similar, it will reduce the likelihood of
cyber-squatting or even risks of phishing of .com.sg domain names.
This approach should work in Singapore since we are small in size.
(I won't prescribe this solution to .com registrars as it is not humanly
possible for them.)

Cheers.
Onn Chee

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Poll on whether to disclose identities of
 organisations who leaks info
Message-ID: <49E58D6F.3090102@usa.net>

Hi folks,

A poll was created on http://www.infothatmatter.org/ to seek your
feedback on whether we, as a group, should disclose the identities of
the organisations who are responsible for info leaks.

This is similar to the US regulation on disclosure of data breaches,
albeit we are doing it in a community approach.

Do note the disclosures of identities are still subjected to the code of
ethics, such as no disclosure of leaks' URLs.

Hope to hear from all of you.

Regards
Onn Chee

Hi Darren,

A simple question - what is the basis of suing?


Now, the not-so-simple points.

Firstly, when Websense recently reported that Fiat Singapore website was
hacked and users were at risk of infection when they visited the site,
was Websense sued? Websense did inform Fiat Singapore first. Just like
us - we do inform the organisations or their parent authority about the
leakages first.

Secondly, we did not perform any activities that violates Computer
Misuse Act as we did not compromise their computers.
A simple HTTP GET or POST will get you these results.
Last I check, such actions do not violate Computer Misuse Act.

Thirdly, ST also reported the identities of the guilty organisations.
If reporting such identities is illegal, should SPH be sued too?
SPH will have done their homework to know there is no libel element in
reporting real facts.
(Bet after the NKF case, no one in Singapore has the guts to do so anyway.)

Lastly, we disclose the identities of the responsible organisations, not
the private information (by blanking out such info in the images).
Can't see how this has anything violates privacy laws even if there is one.


So, the issue is not so much about legal risks (I believe).
The question is what we choose to do so as a group.

The upsides of disclosing are as follow:

a) allow the affected parties to identify whether their information is
leaked (through partial NRIC and partial DOB, if any). They can then
decide what to do.
This is about empowerment.

b) raise awareness about the importance of protecting private info
entrusted to the organisations by their clients, customers or even staff.

c) modelled after "better practices" in the US where data breaches are
required by law to be disclosed.

d) "persuade" the organisations to take effective actions to prevent
future occurrences.


The downside of not disclosing is this - organisations take a bo-chap
attitude and only take some nominal actions to remove current
occurrences, but not prevent future occurrences.
Trust me - most organisations, not just the disclosed ones, are guilty
of this.
To them, lesser things to do, the better.

I hope that with the disclosures, they can clean up their act and make
the online world a safer place.

The above points explain why we went for full disclosure.
Nevertheless, we will accord to the wishes of the public/community (PS:
We are still "democratic" though I know Frenky will disagree)
Hence, we are conducting this poll.

Do submit your vote if you want your views to be effective.
Thanks!

Regards
Onn Chee

Message-ID: <49E99A59.6040007@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Kudos to Jackson!
This is our first leakage bust since the portal went live -
http://www.infothatmatter.org/forum/topics/disclosure-of-personal
As per our code of ethics and being a responsible portal, the identity
of LTA was not revealed until the leak was removed.

LTA was informed promptly about this leak and the private information
was subsequently cleaned up (within half a day which is very fast in
garmen terms).
I will like to give special credit to Vincent Leong and Faisal Mohammad
of LTA for their prompt action.

This is what this portal is about, folks!
:-)

I hope more of you can contribute to this portal to make our online
world a safer place.
Cheers and have a nice weekend.

  Researcher offers tool to hide malware in .Net


http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/041709-researcher-offers-tool-to-hide.html?nlhtsec=rn_042009&nladname=042009securityal


".Net-Sploit allows a hacker to modify the .Net framework on targeted
machines, inserting rootkit-style malicious software in a place
untouched by security software and where few security people would think
to look, said Erez Metula, the software security engineer for 2BSecure
who wrote the tool.

"You'll be amazed at how easy it is to devise an attack," Metula said
during a presentation at the Black Hat security conference in Amsterdam
on Friday.

.Net-Sploit essentially lets an attacker replace a legitimate piece of
code within .Net with a malicious one. Since some applications depend on
parts of the .Net framework in order to run, it means the malware can
affect the function of many applications."


Any Java guru out there?

Hi folks,

Just want to keep everyone abreast of our progress.

Since successful disclosure and closure of the LTA leak, we are now
working on the following incidents.
Details will be disclosed once the incidents are closed by the site owners.

1) Private Company A - System info leak and exposure of default files
from app server
2) Private Company B - Leakage of customers' HR info
3) University A - self-leakage by staff of their own private info,
including medical records and personal photos
4) Government Site A - security loophole that allows hackers to send
malicious emails to users under the name of the Site.

As part of our code of ethics, we will keep everyone posted after the
above holes are closed.

So just bear with the suspense for the time being. :-)

	students
Message-ID: <49F2786D.6040403@usa.net>

Hi folks,

After the recent NUS email accident, it seems like the NUS staff / students are also equally guilty of not protecting their own private info.
You can refer to
http://www.infothatmatter.org/forum/topics/selfleakages-on-nus-website-by
for more info.

(PS: These are just tip of the iceberg and the NUS School of Computing is already informed about this.)

If you ask me, the leakage of medical records of 1 person is more sensitive than the leakage of 15700 contact info in the earlier NUS
email accident.
(I feel sad for the person after reading the diagnosis)

As the above item shows, even individuals themselves can be as guilty as the service providers.

Cheers!
