 Invitation to CSSLP Info Session
Message-ID: <4B6BEE34.4000402@usa.net>

Hi folks,

FYI, ISC2 is holding some free talks on their latest SDLC-related
security certification - CSSLP.
As I had always said, all security holes come from software.
For the next generation of security pros, we must be well-versed in SDLC
and be able to review how we develop software.

Feel free to attend if you are interested.

Cheers
Onn Chee

*News Release/Call For Contributors*
*OWASP Development Guide Project begins work on next Guide version*
*The Guide is a manual for designing, developing, and deploying secure
web applications*
 
OWASP Development Guide Project
MCLEAN
February 10, 2010
 
MCLEAN, Feb. 10 /OWASP Development Guide Project
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project>/ -- After
many months of planning and preparation, the OWASP Development Guide
project announced today that it is ready to begin work on the next
revision of the Guide, and that that the project is looking for
volunteers to do the work, both individuals and organizations.
 
The OWASP Development Guide is aimed at architects, developers,
consultants and auditors and is a comprehensive manual for designing,
developing and deploying secure web applications. The original OWASP
Development Guide has become a staple diet for many web security
professionals. Since 2002, the initial version was downloaded over 2
million times. Today, the Development Guide is referenced by many
leading government, financial, and corporate standards and is the Gold
standard for Web Application and Web Service security.
 
The next version of the OWASP Development Guide will be in effect the
detailed design guide for the requirements of the OWASP Application
Security Verification Standard (ASVS), which can be found
here: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS. Key features of the next
Guide will include use of the new OWASP common numbering scheme. The new
numbering scheme will be common across OWASP Guides and References, more
information can be found here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering. Additional key
features will be the inclusion of worksheets and checklists, such as the
sample input validation worksheet which can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/WebAppSecDesignGuide_D5_2_1_1
 
For more information, and for more information if you are interested in
volunteering, please see:
http://owasp-development-guide.googlecode.com/files/development-guide-contributing.pdf 
Please forward this email as you think appropriate. Got buddies and want
to work on a section or two as a team? Professional project management
will be a key feature of the next release of the Guide and can help to
facilitate such arrangements. Here is what the work streams will look
like: http://owasp-development-guide.googlecode.com/files/guide-org-chart.pdf. And,
the Guide project is always on the lookout for volunteers. If you think
you might have availability in the future, please do reach out at that
time. For more information, email the OWASP Development Guide project
manager Mike Boberski at mike.boberski at owasp.org
<mailto:mike.boberski at owasp.org>.

Not really surprise at all .. many companies outsource HR processes like
payroll, compensation and benefits etc. Many of those service providers are
not up to standard in terms of information security controls.

Hmmm, a suitable script for the next sci-fi thriller?

"The attack began on the afternoon of Jan. 11 when the hacker contacted
Register.com tech help via online chat and claimed to be from Baidu, the
complaint alleges. The attacker asked a support representative to change
Baidu's e-mail address on file. The representative then sent a
confirmation code to Baidu's e-mail account even though the hacker
answered a security question incorrectly, the complaint alleges.

The attacker could not access Baidu's e-mail account, so instead made up
a confirmation code and sent it to the support representative when
asked, the complaint alleges. Without comparing the two codes, the
support representative took the bogus answer to be correct and agreed to
the attacker's request to change Baidu's e-mail address on file to
"antiwahabi2008 at gmail.com", the complaint alleges.

"Incredibly," the complaint says, Register.com "thus changed the e-mail
address on file from one that was clearly a business address and
contained the name of the account owner, to an e-mail address that
conveyed a highly politically charged message ('antiwahabi'), with the
domain name ('gmail.com') of a competitor of Baidu, at the request of an
individual who not only could not produce the correct security
verification, but actually produced false information twice."
