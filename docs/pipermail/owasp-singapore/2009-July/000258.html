<PRE>Agreed Onn Chee. The intend was to provide a more vendor independent
approach to security. However, with the suggestion to installing multiple
browsers, I would like to present the other side of the story.

1. The more browser you install, the more vigilant you have to be in
patching. For example, instead of just IE, now you need to patch Firefox
regularly too. This is something that (unfortunately) administrator do not
like. I personally know of examples where organizations BANS Firefox simply
for this reason.

2. Installing more browser increases the exposure of being attacked.
Because browsers often comes with many components, it can often be
exploited as long as the component exist. This can also applies to the
number of plugins you install onto the browsers in order to increase the
functionality (as well as security risk).

3. Developers resists to multiple browser. They only wish to test their
software on 1 and make sure it work. The more browser there is to test, the
more work they need to do. Therefore more often than not, they simple put a
disclaimer to say it only works in browser X.

Being said the above, I installed more than 5 browsers myself though. The
reasons is more for testing and cross referencing the diff behavior (for
example to certain exploits).

As for the IE plugin, the affected DLL is msvidctl.dll. Microsoft's
solution via
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-032.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-032.mspx</A>
addresses this by using the Killbit to disable the function. Remember to
reboot your system after installing the patch though.

And kinda of a good news for Vista and 2K8 users, the vulnerability takes a
lot more to work on these systems.

Hi Winston,

Agree, we (at least for me) are not saying which browser is better than the
other.
Just as you said that FF (or Opera and Safari) has its own share of
vulnerabilities.
This topic is not about a browser war. :-)

Instead, I want to highlight that the usual practice of a single browser in
corporates is high risk and should be discouraged.
It is common sense that we do not put all our eggs in 1 basket.
And if we can do so for our security systems, such as F/W, why not apply
such good practice to the browser too?

I strongly advocate a dual browser environment for corporates, so that
organisations can enjoy the flexibility of switching browsers (can be
temporary) when any unpatched vulnerabilities in one of the browser are
found. To achieve this, all internal web applications must be cross-browser
compatible. Hence, the IS team must also work with the apps team to achieve
better protection from browser vulnerabilities.

Lastly, as a matter of curiosity, you mentioned that the recent IE is a
plugin problem.
So can we uninstall DirectDraw plugin from IE?
If yes, can you share with group?
Uninstallation, if possible, should be more effective than the MS method.

      To be fair, this vulnerability affected a particular plugin in IE,
      not the
      browser itself.

      All browsers has their own issues, you install one, you make sure you
      patch
      that one more. I believe safe browsing is still the fundamental
      protection
      that is required rather than a technical solution.

      Just for the scoreboard, Firefox just got 0-dayed against with
      another
      vulnerability.

      yes, and usually IE is the one browser...  i am still wondering

            Thanks, Aung.

            This incident further gives merit to the good&#65533; practice to use
            multiple
            browsers. :-)

            That's why I find corporates, who standardise on only 1
            browser, look a

      bit

            naive in terms of web security.

            Just like one should not only have firewalls from a single
            vendor, one
            should not only use web browser from a single vendor too.

            But well, good advice tends to fall on deaf ears.

            And many in Singapore have deaf ears. ;-)
            LOL.
