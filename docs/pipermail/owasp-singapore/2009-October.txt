Subject: [Owasp-singapore] DDOS attacks - topic for Oct meetup
Message-ID: <4AC6E5BF.8040601@usa.net>

Hi folks,

The recent concluded Govware saw lots of interest on DDOS attacks.

I will like to suggest the topic of DDOS attacks for our Oct meetup.

Any one for this topic?

Or even like to speak on this topic too?

Regards
Onn Chee

Hi everyone,

Just to keep all of you posted.

Kostas and Anton have kindly agreed to share with us on the topic of DDOS.
Hence, we may get 2 solid speakers for this upcoming meetup.
For time purposes, each sharing session is limited to 30 mins.

I will start off with a short leading introduction and close off the
whole meetup with some insights into the recent Melbourne Film Fest DDOS
by the Chinese hackers and a new form of Layer 7 DDOS attacks.

Regards

Now, it is time for security pros to show business mgt that it really

Guess Heartland may be going under soon now that Visa had removed
Heartland from the list of approved PCI-compliant processors....

Morning everyone,

Do anyone know how to calculate how long does a particular strength of an
encryption algorithm protect the data till?

For example, how long does brute force take to break a 3DES 192 bit
encrypted data? Is there any standard industry calculation used to determine
this?

i would recommend u to refer to Practical Cryptography -

This a chapter on keys, which i think will answer your question.

Hi Donald,

Do note that the time duration is also dependent on the computing power
of available machines in the market.

Remember Moore's Law that claims computing power doubles every 18 months.
Actually, the doubling in computing power had happened in less than 18
months.

Hi Onn Chee,

Yup, I know the term. I wanna to know better how the industry set a standard
that a certain no. of bits is consider good of particular algorithm for a
year before need to change the key again.

If I tell someone 1024bits RSA is good enough for his objective, I do wanna
prove it to them too. Just wonder is there certain way to calculate for such
things.

Donald

Many thanks to all those who attended the talk on Thu.
We had so many interesting discussions that we over-stayed and were even
chased out by the CC staff. :-)

Just an update to the group on the new Layer 7 DDOS attacks.
We had just completed initial tests against one of the commercial DDOS
protection systems with our DDOS assessment tool and, unfortunately, the
DDOS assessment tool was able to even bring down the system.

Many thanks to those who had agreed to offer their protection
systems/web servers for tests against this new DDOS attack. I will
follow up with you to conduct the tests asap. For the rest, if you are
interested to participate in this free assessment, do drop me a note.

Once the tests are completed, I will put up the list of generally
accepted countermeasures, which were proposed by those who were present,
to Puppetnets, the Melbourne Film Festival DDOS attacks and the new
Layer 7 DDOS attack.

I hope this list of countermeasures can then be published in the press
to share with rest of Singapore on how to protect against DDOS attacks.

Seems like keyloggers, not phishing, may be in play here.

Hi Anton,

In your view, is this a good development?

Cos if StartCom does not validate the owner of the certs properly (aka
like GoDaddy), it may open a can of worms for increased and better
phishing attacks.

  Programmer slip-up produces critical bug, Microsoft admits

Back to my constant pitch that most, if not all, security issues
originate from software.

Hence, we need the next generation of IS pros to be software experts in
being about to *prevent*, not just mitigate, security vulnerabilities.

The "a-peh" or older generation of IS pros had been playing a reactive
game, mainly restricting ourselves to the OS and network.
We need to change how we play to better survive in the new era.

I hope this is a wake-up call for IS pros to engage more in the software
development circle.

Just my $0.02.

Cheers
Onn Chee

Hi Ben,

Thanks for your kind support of my $0.02. :-)

That is one thing I will like to voice out, if you do not mind.

I think your claim about MS' SDL is the most mature and comprehensive
may not be substantiated.

For example, the IBM folks may counter that their SDL is more mature
since IBM has been around way longer than MS.

My view is that no one is the best (that's why MS continues to have
bugs, right?) and we just have to constantly learn from multiple sources
to extract the best from each source.

I wanted to update on the email security research we are doing.

 

Last week, we contacted 7 different enterprise networks, using different
email security solutions from various vendors. This list included
appliances, secure messaging services, hosted and in-house. Each contact
approved, so we sent a spoofed email and monitored/measured the results.
We are now compiling the information, and giving the vendors a chance to
respond.

 

Results Overview:

But the results were that our spoofed email attacks got by 100% of all
the latest email security controls and were delivered to the inbox. AND,
the client could click on the link without the client email program or
browser setting off any alarms or alerts. This is especially dangerous
with Smartphone's as they make it very hard to dig into the email
headers, if not impossible.

 

All the tests were sent using our testing framework, and the emails were
the same. Only thing changed was the TO: address for each test.  The
FROM: was clearly spoofed, and did not match up with our sending email
server.

 

I was told that most current email security appliances/services should
be able to pick up on spoofed emails, especially from well known brands
(Linkedin, EBay, PayPal, Microsoft, etc).

 

So to be fair, I'm going to send the research to each vendor and give
them time to respond before releasing details.

 

If you have email security controls in place, and would like for me to
send you a test email to be included in the research let me know. I'm
planning to release the research every Wednesday over the next month

 

1)      Email Research -- SaaS, Appliances, Vendor Security

2)      Client Security (Outlook, Outlook Express, Opera Mail,
Thunderbird, etc)

3)      Smartphone email client security (Iphone, Palm, Blackberry)

4)      Client exploit research

I am sure this will give security folks like us a "better" reputation

Anyone care to write an open letter to Steve Balmer on behalf of the
community?

It will carry more weight if the author is a MVP too. :-)

*Data breach alerts linked to increased risk of ID theft*
http://www.scmagazineus.com/Data-breach-alerts-linked-to-increased-risk-of-ID-theft/article/156376/

"The survey also found that despite the fact that those who received a
notification letter were four times more likely to experience fraud,
*/just two percent of identity theft victims/* attributed the fraud to
the data breach, the study found. "

Vamosi said that this finding could indicate a "/*disconnect*/ between
breach notification and consumer understanding of the consequences."


Onn Chee's view:

When you were notified your identity was leaked due to a data leak, why
wouldn't you attribute subsequent frauds with your stolen identity to
the leak?

Are consumers becoming like characters in Dumb and Dumber????

That is getting beyond my comprehension....
