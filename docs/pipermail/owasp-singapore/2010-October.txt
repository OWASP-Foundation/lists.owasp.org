Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Fwd: [Owasp-leaders] Fwd: OWASP XSS CAMPAIGN
Message-ID: <4CA9E28B.1090302@usa.net>

 Hi folks,

Please read the email below.

There is a site, http://xssed.com, for insecure websites with XSS, but
it is still very overseas-focused.

As mentioned before, I am all for raising the awareness of secure web
development via alternative means.

To date, I have not received any suggestions on how we can raise the
awareness without "/promotion of the "sexy hacked" headline news
grabbing xss stuff/".

Hope to hear from you soon.

If there is no better suggestion by end Oct, we will go for the public
disclosure route for insecure SG websites.
Do note that responsible disclosure process will still be observed in
the public disclosure portal if we ever set up one.

Regards
Onn Chee

Subject: OWASP XSS CAMPAIGN
To: owasp-leaders


We ALL really hate XSS its a lame finding at this point for many..

Last night over beers in NYC there were a few smirks that PCI leader
Visa and other banks are "on the list" this week

http://xssed.com/archive/special=1 

See VISA (9/19/2010)

Instead of being part of a problem -- I rather be part of solutions
that benefit the OWASP global mission.

I propose *_AWARENESS WEEK starting right now_* -  WE globally make a
effort to raise some attention for OWASP Worldwide using this issue for
a awareness campaign on blogs, articles, twitter interviews etc.. get
the word out.    By promotion of the "sexy hacked" headline news
grabbing xss stuff we can help raise awareness of local chapters -
additional visibility for application security (Our mission BTW) and
once again reinforce that OWASP Foundation is a lighthouse and resource
for the concerned to attend our events, read the guides.

This is how OWASP can "market" our professional association, gain more
respect from Industry as the good-guys here to help.

Knowledge: 
 
Conferences coming up -
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference
Local chapter meetings
- http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Chapter#Local_Chapters

and projects in the works to help those that want help
- http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_(OWASP-DV-001)
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_%28OWASP-DV-001%29> 

I know we are preaching to the choir at OWASP about XSS but the general
public is NOT AWARE OF THE IMPACT combined others from the Top 10 ie CSRF

Thank you in advance for getting on your soap box and contribution to
this awareness campaign.

"And because groups such as Team Elite go looking for them these
problems regularly get a public airing. Even though there's evidence of
miscreants exploiting these vulnerabilities that's no reason to dismiss

Subject: Stux it to the man

As I pick through the trail of debris left by Stuxnet in India, the turn of geopolitical events behind this watershed incident do not cease to spark my imagination. Enough has been said about the sheer technical brilliance and the blatant shortcomings of this attack, let's go a bit further and try to hypothesize (very briefly) the strategic and tactical underpinnings. For the sake of argument, blame it all on Israel as we usually do. 

I will continue from where Robert Baer left off. In March, the former CIA field officer and operative par-excellence wrote an article assessing the potential fallouts of the Mahmoud al-Mabhouh incident. Mabhouh, a senior Hamas operative, was found dead in a Dubai hotel on Jan 19, assassinated by a Mossad hit-squad. The brazenness and temerity with which this operation was executed left many nations fuming. With Dubai leading the acerbic opposition, any hopes to forge an Arab Sunni lobby or availing the Gulf airspace for a missile attack on Iranian nuclear installations were quashed. But the 'Plan B' was already in progress. Little did Robert knew that the world has changed a lot since Osirak. Stuxnet began spreading in January too. The chain of command must have explored all the options.

When I first heard about the little-known Stuxnet in July, I was inspired to write an article on how conventional armies will leverage cyberspace as an element of surprise, paving the way for swift and decisive information superiority. A 'Unified Cyber Command' using everything under its disposal - a decision analytics platform fed by information from a dedicated and ongoing CYBERINTEL campaign to an active electronically scanned array (AESA) based cyber-jammer mounted on a fighter. A few years ago when the cyberwar rhetoric had picked pace, this domain finally found its place in the 'conflict spectrum' - somewhere between 'petty crimes' and 'organized cartels'. Well, I am darn sure that Stuxnet pushed it up by a few notches on an axis which terminated on 'nuclear attack'.

 Operations - Daily Life of Infosec"
Message-ID: <4CB5BECE.9010200@usa.net>

 Hi folks,

I have secured a panelist who is willing to share on the above topic and
I will like to seek more panelists on this topic.

As mentioned before, we are going for a panel discussion format, so each
panelist only have to prepare no more than 5 slides.
The panelists can also pose only questions, instead of pointers.
Many a time, interesting questions do lead to interesting discussions.

The objective is to solicit more participation and ideas from the group.
As the saying goes, more heads are better than one.
And I believe with all our heads combined, we can be the right platform
for fellow infosec pros to gather, share and learn.

Hope to see you volunteering to be a panelist!
Cheers!

Hi folks,

As discussed earlier, we will like to build a rich media, (videos, PDFs,
PPTs, web articles) repository of developer-friendly educational content
based on OWASP Top 10 2010.

We will host this repository on OWASP SG website and the repository is
free for all to refer to.

The objective is to provide a good quality reference page with the
content friendly and easy to understand for developers.

Please actively contribute to this OWASP SG initiative to help bring the
secure development message to developers.

Regards
Onn Chee
