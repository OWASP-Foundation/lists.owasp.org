Meetup Description

Web applications are more pervasive than ever and business owners are
always trying to out-do one another by improving functionality and
enabling greater business interaction with their customer base in order
to save money or find new sources of revenue. As they steam ahead, web
applications are oftentimes secured as an after thought rather than as
part of the development lifecycle. This is good news for consultants who
specialize in application vulnerability assessment services because
there is a continuous stream of work. But companies are realizing that
the consultancy approach does not scale and that scanning tools are
approaching the depth of what a consultant can do. Does continuous
improvement in scanning technology and SaaS offerings spell the end of
the consultancy approach? Can the tools possibly achieve the same depth
and cost-effectively scale across the enterprise? Are there hybrid
approaches that offer the best of both worlds? Attend this presentation
to discover the answers to these questions and more.

Speaker:
Claudio Scarabello, Global Product Manager

Personal Biography:
Claudio Scarabello is a Product Manager with Verizon Business
specialised in IT risk and compliance management methodologies. As an
articulate speaker and educator, he has been involved in information
security markets around the globe since 1996 and is currently
responsible for solutions focused on application security. Currently
based in Singapore, he previously spent over 6 years in Brussels
managing European responsibilities and had North American roles based in
Toronto, Canada.

 Hi Kaushal,

I believe there are a number of our members working in consulting
organisations which can provide such services.

OWASP SG does not maintain such a list as we are vendor-neutral and do
not want to get involved in commercial interests.

Do you have a business need?

If yes, I will leave it to our members to contact you directly. :-)

Onn Chee

Hi Christian

Thanks for the response.
We just require the names of vendors who can do such Compliance testing for
us or our preferred vendors who help support the applications for us on
thier own infrastructure.

I need some references of such vendors in SG or APAC who can be contacted at
the earliest.

regards
Kaushal

I believe all the vendors in Singapore will tell you that they do follow the OWASP standards for application ethical hacking.

First of all, look for a reputable vendor. Second, request for their consultants' CV. Thirdly, test the consultant practical knowledge and methodology. Lastly, select the best consultants.

Andrew Chong

Just to add on some pragmatism.

Choose one that fits your budget too, cos your CFO usually does not give you the funds for the best consultant.

Subject: 	[Owasp-leaders] OWASP Project - AppSensor - Elevator Pitch
Date: 	Tue, 14 Sep 2010 11:32:19 -0700



All,

I found out that many active OWASP'ers are not aware of other very
active OWASP projects (myself included).  So here is an elevator pitch
for my very active project. I encourage other active projects to do the
same.

*OWASP AppSensor*
Would you know if you application is under attack? If it was, could you
stop the attacker? The AppSensor project builds an automatic detection
and prevention system into the application itself. The goal is to
identify a malicious attacker through detection points and eliminate
them before they can find and exploit a vulnerability in your app.

This project is making tons of progress and already supports ESAPI
integration or stand-alone use.

*Presentation from OWASP AppSecUSA*
http://www.slideshare.net/michael_coates/real-time-application-defenses-the-reality-of-appsensor-esapi-5181743

*Project Website*

Some interesting questions for us to think about:

- How were developers taught dodgy development practices?
- Is something broken in how we teach developers?
- If it is true that our developers are not taught in the right way,
should we focus our efforts on the schools where developers are trained,
instead of relying on OJT to learn about secure web app development?

What do you think?

 Hi Claudio,

Good insight.

Should we update consumers that they have the right to sue a website
owner if the website is insecure and infects their visitors?
This way, the business folks will stop ignoring the value of appsec.
When their pockets are hurt, the business folks will move.

Perhaps we should run an awareness campaign to educate and inform
consumers about their rights.
I believe such a campaign benefits all infosec pros.
What do you think?

The only people to benefit from law suits are the lawyers. 
Trust me they do not need another source of income.

I would agree that awareness and education is key. For consumers and businesses its one of choice. That is when people if realise they are at 'risk' will take their business else where.

What needs to be demonstrate that good security= trust = $.

Hi,

Coming back to the original question of secure development. This is a very big 
problem that has been there for sometime as all here know.

Almost all of OWASP is dedicated to help in scenarios like these. I would like 
to share some things I have with you.

First and foremost let me talk about a project I truly believe in. This is 
called as the OWASP Enterprise Security API. I am currently handling the project 
development for the Objective-C platform. The aim of ESAPI is this:
ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web 
application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to 
write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it 
easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The 
ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development.
Allowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions have the 
same basic design:
	* There is a set of security control interfaces. They define for example types 
of parameters that are passed to types of security controls.
	* There is a reference implementation for each security control. The logic is 
not organization?specific and the logic is not application?specific. An example: 
string?based input validation.
	* There are optionally your own implementations for each security 
control. There may be application logic contained in these classes which may be 
developed by or for your organization. An example: enterprise authentication. 


You can find the link here 
.. http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API

Currently ESAPI Java is the most updated version. The .Net and php versions are 
also out there and usable immediately. 

Objective-C is relatively new and still trying to catch up :) 

Any help that can be provided in development towards this project is 
appreciated. Feel free to contact me for any details necessary.

Best Regards,
Deepak Subramanian

 Hi folks,

If you are a registered OWASP SG member, you are in for a treat.

Thanks to Cecil, HITB is giving a discount of RM300 for OWASP SG members
when you register for HITB.

This means you only need to pay RM599 instead of RM899 (or RM1299 if you
walk in to register)

If you are interested to attend HITB, please contact me and furnish me
with your OWASP membership number.

Do note only registered OWASP members are eligible for such discounts.
