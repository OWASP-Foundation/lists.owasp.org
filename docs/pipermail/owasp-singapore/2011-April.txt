I bet McKinsey did not do pentesting for their email marketing vendor.

Please inform all your marketing folks about the risks, if you have not.

From: 	Paulo Coimbra



Leaders,

 

I am glad to announce we've just set a new project up -- the */OWASP
Hatkit Proxy Project,/* led by *Martin Holst Swende*. Please join me to
congratulate him!

 

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Hatkit_Proxy_Project#tab=Project_About

 

The primary purpose of the Hatkit Proxy (which is based on the Owasp
Proxy Project) is to create a minimal, lightweight proxy which stores
traffic into an offline storage where further analysis can be performed,
e.g. all kinds of analysis which is currently implemented by the proxies
themselves (webscarab/burp/paros etc).

 

As always, your suggestions and contributions would be greatly
appreciated.   

 

Thanks,

- Paulo

 

Paulo Coimbra,

OWASP Project Manager <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Paulo_Coimbra>

I probably shouldn't ask this and it's likely been asked and answered
somewhere.. but I keep asking myself: apart from the "TCP proxy"
functions, in what ways will we benefit from yet another HTTP MITM
proxy, especially when it's (again) Java based, and even more
particularly, derived from existing (still ongoing I supposed)
project?

I'll be the happy person if there's a .NET based one with similar
UI/UX as Burp/Paros/WebScarab -- not talking about Fiddler here if you
know what I mean. Or.. is one there already? Free/open, I hope?

In any case, I'm not trying to diss the project or author(s). In fact
I'll download and have it installed, just in case. You can even ignore
or belittle my armchair reaction above, no offense will be taken :)

Regards,
Ganius

Hi folks,

Does anyone know the person in charge of GV portal?

I was trying to buy something online and saw another person's NRIC, full
name, mobile and email address in the page source. I was so shocked as I
had bought movie tickets online before.

(OMG! It is awarded TrustSG seal too!)

Can't disclose anything more before this leak is plugged. ;-)

In the meantime, please refrain from buying tickets online from GV portal.

Hope someone can point me to the right person to escalate to.
Thanks in advance.

I nearly laughed my head off when I read this

"In the Observatory we have discovered many examples of CA-signed
certificates unqualified domain names. In fact, the most common
unqualified name is 'localhost', which always refers to /your own
computer/! It simply makes no sense for a public CA to sign a
certificate for this private name."

The web of trust inherent for CAs to function is slowly decaying....

Hi,

Just a thought that came to my mind.

How secure is SingPass as a authentication model in Singapore? SingPass was
introduced on year 2003, and till now handling millions of authentication
for our government.

Does anyone have any insights on how the SingPass authentication model
works?

You should go for NAF (National Authentication Framework) because of its
better security since STE Infosec has already embarked on its development.

I am not privy to the project timeline, but if you are interested, I can
link you up with them.

 eCrime Operations Summit V @ Kuala Lumpur April 27-29
Message-ID: <4DA7C46A.7090807@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) is holding their Fifth Counter eCrime
Operations Summit in KL from April 27-29.
For more details, you can refer to
http://www.apwg.org/events/2011_opSummit.html.

Here is a short description:

"The fifth annual Counter-eCrime Operations Summit (CeCOS V) will engage
questions of operational challenges and the development of common
resources for the first responders and forensic professionals who
protect consumers and enterprises from the ecrime threat every day. This
year's meeting will focus on the development of response paradigms and
resources for counter-ecrime managers and forensic professionals.
Presenters will proffer case studies of national and regional economies
under attack, narratives of successful trans-national forensic
cooperation as well as models for cooperation and unified response
against ecrime and data resources for forensic activities."

As OWASP members, you are entitled to discounted member rates of US$225,
instead of US$300.

If you are interested, do drop me a note about the discount code as I
can only release the code to registered and paying OWASP members.


Sorry for sounding like a broken record...please BECOME A OWASP member!

Cheers!
