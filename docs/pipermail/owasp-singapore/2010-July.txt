Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Poll: Full disclosure or wait until vendor
	releases fix
Message-ID: <4C3353EB.90406@usa.net>

Hi folks,

With reference of
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/30/windows_exploit_spike/,  I like
to seek your view on this perennial question:

Should we practice full disclosure before the fix or wait until the
vendor releases the fix?

The cons of the former have been mentioned in the above article that it
gives rise to increase in number of exploits.

For the latter, the problem is sometime the product vendors drag their
feet in releasing a fix.
To them, they usually focus on vulnerabilities which have known public
exploits first, instead of those discovered but undisclosed vulnerabilities.

Like to hear your personal views on this question.

Cheers!

Dear OWASP friends,

AppSec US 2010, the premiere OWASP conference in the US, is less than
2 months away. We have published training schedule and conference
agenda (http://appsecUSA.org/agenda). At this point, I would like to
ask your help to help promote the event -- to your friends, family
members, colleagues, bosses, other IT organizations, etc.

We are designating July 19-25 as AppSec TweetWeek and please promote
the conference on Twitter, and your other favorite social media. Here
are a few things you can do.

* Follow @appsec2010 (http://twitter.com/appsec2010).
* Tag your tweets/updates with #appsec2010
* Retweet @appsec2010
* Tweet about the schedule, keynote, training, classes
* Tweet about what to do in Southern Cal.

If you have a blog, please blog about the conference.

If you would like to volunteer for the conference, please let Neil
Matatall (neil at owasp.org) know.

Thank you very much for your help and we hope to see many of you in
Southern California in September!

Hi leaders!

The conference guide for OWASP AppSec Research 2010 featured an
interview I did with Jeff Williams, volunteer chair of OWASP. Now it's
online. Read his view on:

    * Will OWASP ever reach out to developers?
    * Application security and the word Trust
    * Do developers care about rugged software?
    * Java rootkits and trusted developers

Abstract

If your company?s website were hacked tomorrow, would you know what to do?

Forensics is not what you see on CSI, and most people have no idea what
they should do in the event of a compromise. What is an appropriate
incident response for a company, what do you say to your CEO and when do
you involve law enforcement? This presentation will demonstrate the
forensic process for a compromised website, and what an organization
should do when they find out they have been compromised. I will use case
studies from previous incidents I have investigated and demonstrate what
you should and shouldn?t do when you get pwned.

Speaker: Paul Craig

My name is Paul Craig and I work as the lead forensic incident responder
at Security-Assessment.com. I have seen first-hand hackers defacing,
defrauding and compromising small websites, large corporations and
government agencies. IT Forensics is here to pick up the pieces, and
it?s my job to spend long nights trying to provide answers to businesses
regarding what really happened.

Venue:

Cairnhill Community Club

Date/Time:

2 August 7pm.
