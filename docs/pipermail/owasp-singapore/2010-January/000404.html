Subject: 	OWASP for Charities: Haiti relief effort
Date: 	Tue, 19 Jan 2010 16:14:39 -0500
From: 	Kate Hartmann &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-singapore">kate.hartmann at owasp.org</A>&gt;

OWASP Members and Supporters,

OWASP was founded, and is supported as a non-profit organization, by a
group of dedicated volunteers who believe that all applications should
be secure and trusted.  As our organization matures we have taken those
beliefs broader, and have started setting up ways for our members to
donate to the global community.  Among these initiatives are:

    * OWASP has an active Kiva lending team who have donated $9,125.00
      to date.  <A HREF="http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522">http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522</A>
    * OWASP in response to the need in Haiti has set up a secure and
      trusted way for those within the OWASP community to donate funds
      to help the people of Haiti. This allows our OWASP community to
      help another with a single global voice.  100% of the collected
      donations will be transferred directly to victims for disaster
      relief such as food and medical requirements.  Please visit
      www.owasp.org &lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org">http://www.owasp.org</A>&gt; and click the link for
      G33k-4-HAITI.  In a time of crisis, OWASP can help those who are
      in great need. The OWASP community can help organize, support ,
      and promote efforts outside of application security.

OWASP is well aware there is a movement for phishers to utilize this
tragedy to get unsuspecting people to donate to a &quot;cause&quot; without having
a legitimate business back end and ultimately funneling all the money
directly into their own pockets.  The OWASP community is uniquely
qualified to help protect from this type of attack and educate about
attacks as well.

As the world becomes more dependent on technology and particularly web
applications, there are many who need protection who simply have no
options to protect themselves.  These include small companies,
individuals, charities, and others.  The OWASP community can help by
connecting qualified, trusted resources willing to volunteer their time
to those organizations which qualify. OWASP is setting up an outreach
program, which will be under the name project name of OWASP for Charities. 

We hope you will support OWASPs efforts to make a difference  in any of
the above ways. We are also open to suggestions in regards to where you
feel the OWASP Community can be of service.

Regards,

Your OWASP Board
