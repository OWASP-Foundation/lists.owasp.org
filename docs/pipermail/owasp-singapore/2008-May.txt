Subject: [Owasp-singapore] NSA Attacks West Point! Relax,
	It's a Cyberwar Game
Message-ID: <48299CE3.5050109@usa.net>

The 34 Army cadets comprising the West Point IT team operated in a 
different kind of battlefield, but their combat skills and instincts 
need to be every bit as sharp. Like George Washington said: "There is 
nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet the 
enemy."

The SQL injections, targeting their Fedora Core 8 Web server, were a 
piece of cake for these IT combatants. Each injection tried to smuggle 
malicious code inside the seemingly harmless language used by the 
network?s MySQL software. The cadets handily defended with open source 
Apache web server modules, plus some manual tweaking of the SQL database 
to "avoid any surprises," in the words of Lt Col. Joe Adams, a West 
Point instructor who helped coach the team.

But the kernel-level rootkit was much more dangerous. This stealthy 
operating-system hijacker can open unseen "back doors" into even highly 
protected networks. When they detected the rootkit's "calls home" the 
cadets launched Sysinternal's security software to find the hijacker, 
then they manually scoured the workstation to find the unwelcome 
executable file.

Then they terminated it. With extreme prejudice.

Hi Onn Chee,

Thank you very much for your help in sending the details out to your mailing list.

I am very sorry that due to overwhelming response, all the seats were taken up soon after I sent the mail out to you, and hence the registration was closed.

We hope that this has not caused you any inconvenience, and that we can work together for future application security activities.

Shir-ly

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] June 08 meetup - 19 June in Microsoft office +
	Photographer
Message-ID: <483ACB9C.3030001@usa.net>

Hi everyone,

I have managed to secure Dennis Chung from MS to present a talk on 
Windows 2008 Security to our OWASP/SSMG communities on 19 June in 
Microsoft office.

Is everyone ok with the change from our usual meetup on 2nd Thu of the 
month and our usual venue in JCU?
Will need at least 5 yes to indicate some degree of group consensus.

Lastly, we need some photographers who can help to take photos of our 
meetups.
Condition is that they cannot be as lousy as me. :-)
Any volunteers?

Regards,
Onn Chee
