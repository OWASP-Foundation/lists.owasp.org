 Doesn't Want To Do Windows Anymore

http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/google-reportedly-phasing-out-use-of-windows-marketnewsvideo.html?partner=alerts


    Google reportedly is phasing out use of Microsoft's Windows
    operating system internally. The Financial Times reported that,
    because of security concerns about hacking attacks and viruses,
    Google has been ending its use of Windows since January.

Question: If they have no Windows, how are they going to develop their
Windows apps???

"Somehow, the hackers have posted malicious HTML code on the affected
Web sites that redirects victims to a malicious Web server. This server
tries to install software on Web visitors' computers. If it's
successful, the software gives the criminals a way to remotely control
their victims' PCs."

" On some very large Web sites, attackers were able to install their
code only on certain pages, rather than the entire site. Often, hackers
get limited access because they break into a partner site -- an ad
company, for example -- that is allowed to post on certain parts of the
larger company's Web site."

Besides blocking SQL injection (which is useless against the "ad"
technique), will outbound monitoring of web servers further help detect
and even prevent the malicious links from being displayed to the
innocent visitors?

Message-ID: <4C190BCC.20105@usa.net>

http://praetorianprefect.com/archives/2010/06/going-after-bp/

Have fun reading how the "Reddit hacker" went about finding holes in BP
websites to poke.

I like the one which they found a valid username from the footer of a
Word doc and the one with usernames and passwords in PDF files.
;-)

And their ending statement. ;-)

Aside of having fun from reading this article, a more serious question
is how you can detect such info leakages from your organisation's web
sites today.
Lest your organisation becomes the target of the next funny article on
Praetorian Prefect.

Cheers

Poorly designed and developed web app in terms of protecting against
info leakage.

"There?s no hack, no infiltration, and no breach, just a really poorly
designed web application that returns e-mail address when ICCID is
passed to it."

Now, doesn't that sound very familiar?

Message-ID: <4C21AD9F.3020209@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Check out
http://www.infothatmatter.org/forum/topics/dmg-securities-leaked-out

Private emails sent between DMG and their customers since 2002 to this
month were leaked via the web.

We did not count the total number of email as there were 8 years worth
of emails being leaked.
Too damaging for our eyes to count. ;-)

After more than a month of notice and friendly reminders, they finally
protected email server with access control.
(But the authentication is not protected by SSL/TLS !! Now, that is
another story to be continued....)

I bet this leakage rivals those NUS cases published in the press. ;-)

Happy reading!

Regards
Onn Chee

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Are you ready for security in a IPv6 world?
Message-ID: <4C21B942.4040005@usa.net>

http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/061710-ipv4-addresses.html?source=NWWNLE_nlt_security_2010-06-21


  Run on IPv4 addresses could exhaust supply by December


IANA tracks IPv4 address space in blocks of 16 million addresses, which
are known in network engineering parlance as a "/8." At the beginning of
2010, IANA had 26 /8s left. Currently, IANA has 16 /8s remaining
unallocated.

"We've gone through 10 /8s since the beginning of this year," Jimmerson
says. "To put that in perspective, in all of 2009, we only went through
eight /8s. It's very possible that the IANA free pool will deplete in
December or January at the earliest."

One reason that unallocated IPv4 address space could be depleted this
year is that IANA has a policy that states that when there are only five
remaining /8s, it will automatically give one to each of the registries
and thereby deplete the free pool overnight.

"When we get down to seven /8s, it could be a matter of days for us to
get from seven to zero," Jimmerson says. "Once ARIN gets its final /8,
our pool could last anywhere from one day to six months, depending on
demand...The minute that carriers hear the IANA free pool has been
depleted, ISPs will be sure to get their requests in."
