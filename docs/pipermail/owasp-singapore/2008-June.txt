	project.
Message-ID: <48571438.6000406@usa.net>

Hi,

OWASP needs your help with a new important project.

We're creating the OWASP Application Security Desk Reference (ASDR) to 
capture and organize all the foundational knowledge in application 
security.  Like the Physicians' Desk Reference for doctors, this book is 
a well-organized reference work that anyone working in application 
security will want on their desk.

The OWASP ASDR covers application security principles, threat agents, 
attacks, vulnerabilities, controls, technical impacts, and business 
impacts. A 900-page alpha draft is available for your review.  We need 
your help to get a final version created by August 25, 2008!

Some links:

?        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASDR_Table_of_Contents
?        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_ASDR_Workplan

The OWASP ASDR will be the defining reference work in application 
security. Won't you please volunteer and contribute your knowledge to 
the world?  All you have to do is visit the Table of Contents 
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASDR_Table_of_Contents> link above and 
add your name to a section or topics.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Call for contributors - OWASP Testing Guide V3.0
Message-ID: <48586D83.3020509@usa.net>

Hi,

Once again, OWASP needs your help with an important project.

As you probably know, the OWASP Testing Guide V2.0 
<http://www.lulu.com/content/1375886> was a great success, with thousand 
of downloads and a great deal of companies adopting it as standard for a 
Web Application Penetration Testing. Now it is time to begin a new 
project based on the previous V2.0.

 

The project?s goal is to create a "best practices" penetration-testing 
framework, which users can implement in their own organizations and a 
"low level" penetration-testing guide that describes how to find certain 
issues.

Is there anyone who is interested to present on your pet topics?

If there is no reply by this Thursday 3 July, I will be forced to cancel

Hope to hear from you soon.
