Subject: [Owasp-singapore] PCI-DSS: Relevance of OWASP and Need for Code
	Review
Message-ID: <486D87E9.1090503@usa.net>

In Pg 2,

Properly implemented, one or more of these four alternatives could meet 
the intent of Option 1 and provide the minimum level
of protection against common web application threats:
     1. Manual review of application source code
     2. Proper use of automated application source code analyzer 
(scanning) tools
     3. Manual web application security vulnerability assessment
     4. Proper use of automated web application security vulnerability 
assessment
        (scanning) tools


In Pg 5,

A web application firewall should be able to:
....
? Meet all applicable PCI DSS requirements pertaining to system 
components in
  the cardholder data environment.
? React appropriately (defined by active policy or rules) to threats 
against relevant
  vulnerabilities as identified, at a minimum, in the OWASP Top Ten 
and/or PCI
  DSS Requirement 6.5.
? Inspect web application input and respond (allow, block, and/or alert) 
based on
  active policy or rules, and log actions taken.
? Prevent data leakage?meaning have the ability to inspect web application
  output and respond (allow, block, mask and/or alert) based on the 
active policy
  or rules, and log actions taken.
? Enforce both positive and negative security models. The positive model 
(?white
  list?) defines acceptable, permitted behavior, input, data ranges, 
etc., and denies
  everything else. The negative model (?black list?) defines what is NOT 
allowed;
  messages matching those signatures are blocked, and traffic not 
matching the
  signatures (not ?black listed?) is permitted.
? Inspect both web page content, such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
  Dynamic HTML (DHTML), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and the
  underlying protocols that deliver content, such as Hypertext Transport 
Protocol
  (HTTP) and Hypertext Transport Protocol over SSL (HTTPS). (In addition to
  SSL, HTTPS includes Hypertext Transport Protocol over TLS.)
? Inspect web services messages, if web services are exposed to the public
  Internet. Typically this would include Simple Object Access Protocol 
(SOAP) and
  eXtensible Markup Language (XML), both document- and RPC-oriented models,
  in addition to HTTP.
? Inspect any protocol (proprietary or standardized) or data construct 
(proprietary
  or standardized) that is used to transmit data to or from a web 
application, when
  such protocols or data is not otherwise inspected at another point in the
  message flow.
  Note: Proprietary protocols present challenges to current application 
firewall
  products, and customized changes may be required. If an application?s
  messages do not follow standard protocols and data constructs, it may 
not be
  reasonable to ask that an application firewall inspect that specific 
message flow.
  In these cases, implementing the code review/vulnerability assessment 
option of
  Requirement 6.6 is probably the better choice.
? Defend against threats that target the WAF itself.
? Support SSL and/or TLS termination, or be positioned such that encrypted
  transmissions are decrypted before being inspected by the WAF. Encrypted
  data streams cannot be inspected unless SSL is terminated ahead of the
  inspection engine.

""They're not doing input validation," he explains. "They're not looking 
at it and saying 'hey, this is not regular user input' -- that's the 
simple version."

But Web administrators have to shoulder the burden of blame too, Bourne 
adds. They're responsible for creating a layered security approach to 
protect against known and yet-to-be-discovered exploits."

I have created a survey to better understand the needs that OWASP 
certification can satisfy and need for every chapter leader to not only 
take the exam, but to forward it to their respective chapter mailing 
lists and other software development and IT security professionals they 
know. We would like to close out this survey on the 25th.

Hi all

I decided it was time that I gave you all an update on the DirBuster  
Project.  Which if you are not familiar with this project it "is a  
multi threaded java application designed to brute force directories  
and files names on web/application servers."

Version 0.10 is ready to download, which is another step towards  
making it a "Release" quality project.  This can be obtained from:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project

Changes from 0.9.12 -> 0.10 are as follows

* Fixed a bug that caused DirBuster to hang, when deselecting items to scan.
* Fixed part of the HTML parse worker so it exits correctly
* More work to finish the treetableview
* Fixed bug that caused purebrute force mode to not work
* Fixed bug that caused fuzz based pure brute force to not work correctly
* Fixed bug that caused part of the code not to work with java 1.5
* Added content length row into results table
* Added a feature to check for new versions of DirBuster
* Fixed bug reported by Ralf Hoelzer, where fuzzing does not correctly  
check the URL to be fuzzed
* Fixed bug reported by Ralf Hoelzer, where if you run a "fuzz" and  
then switch to "list based" things broke
* Fixed error when first item in the tree view was added
* Fixed bug reported by Ralf Hoelzer, report generation fails if you  
tell it to write to directory and not a file
* Added more icons
* Added patch supplied by Ralf Hoelzer, to add a back button to the  
report panel

Suggestions, bug reports and flames are always welcome and appreciated!

James Fisher
