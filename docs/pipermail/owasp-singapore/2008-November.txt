Hi folks,

A contact of mine has just informed me of a good job opening for IS
professionals.

Details of the job vacancy can be found at
https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/job_summary.jsp?pageAction=show&mode=internet&Old_mc=5c46fc8097eb0d21d816e4a4fcccaeff&lang=EN&job_id=ITD-0199622&graduate=999

It will be great if SSMG/OWASP becomes the place for companies to go
look for good IS professionals. :-)

FYI, I do not receive any benefit, monetary or not, for sharing this job
position.
I will continue to do so as long as it benefits our group as a whole.

Regards
Onn Chee

Hi guys,

My good friend, Steven, from Shadowserver Foundation
(www.shadowserver.org) has spotted a C&C botnet node with a Singnet IP.

Does any of you have a personal contact in Singnet whom I can escalate to?
Please don't ask me to send to hostmaster at singnet.com.sg as emails to
this account usually won't be answered.

Thanks.

Hi Michael,

This is a great idea!

I can see that having such talks (though they could be sales talk) will
help our community to have a better understanding of certifications that
are most relevant to IS.

Any one else who is for having a series of talks on IS certifications?

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Faulty Proxy Cache and the Security of your Web
 App - Preso by my good friend Tim Bass
Message-ID: <49243039.4090507@usa.net>

Hi guys,

Just want to bring your attention to the impact of faulty proxy cache on
your web application.

My good friend, Tim Bass, has a good preso
(http://www.thecepblog.com/pdf/OWASP-TAIPEI-Thailand-TBass.pdf) on this
topic for your reference.
You can also visit his blog at
http://www.thecepblog.com/2008/10/28/comments-on-proxy-caches-and-web-application-security-owasp-taipei/

Remember that most countries in Asia use proxies at the national level
(for reasons that I do not need to state), so the risk of a
"crossed-wire" due to faulty proxy cache is not small.

Cheers and happy reading,

Onn Chee

Have fun, guys. :-)

Anyway, I have informed TrustSG about this.
Hope this is not similar to the old problem of "snakeoil" SSL cert from
https://www.trustsg.com.sg (which is no longer accessible).

Cheers

Dear fellow OWASP memebers,
?
Please accept apologies as message is directed?at members who are still a member of the (ISC)2.
?
Fellow (ISC)2 members, you would have received email in regards to the election?for 2008 (ISC)2 Board of Directors?. One of the candidates is Freddy Tan who is also one of our own.
?
Not only he is from Singapore, he is also the only one from Asia.
?
I would strongly urge you to exercise your right to vote for Freddy?as this will give this part of the world a chance to be heard.
?
Please show your support for Freddy too by encouraging fellow (ISC)2 members who you know are less active or have not cast their vote if you have voted.
?
May you all have a pleasant weekend.
?
Thank you.
?
?
Warm regards,
Dick Wong

Subject: [Owasp-Sweden] PhD Positions in Language-based Security at Chalmers
To: owasp-sweden at lists.owasp.org


------------------------------------------------------------------------
*PhD Student Positions in Programming Language-based Security*
Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering
Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden

Application deadline: January 30, 2009

Full version of this announcement is at:
http://www.chalmers.se/cse/EN/news/vacancies/positions/ph-d-positions-in

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The Department*

The department provides a strong, international, and dynamic research
environment with about 75 faculty members. For more information, see
http://www.chalmers.se/cse/EN/.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*PhD Project*

The PhD students will join a world-leading team of researchers on
*programming language-based security*. Language-based security
facilitates specifying and enforcing security policies at the level of
programming languages early in the software design and construction
phase.

Drawing on the recent progress in this area, the goal of the positions
is to pursue the following directions of work:

* To design *rich security policies* for confidentiality and
integrity, as demanded by practical applications (such as web
applications). These security policies should be formal: they
should operate at the level of programming-language semantics.
* To develop *practical enforcement mechanisms* for these policies
in expressive programming languages (such as web languages). These
enforcement mechanisms may combine static (for example, type
system-based) and dynamic (for example, execution
monitoring-based) techniques.
* To support the above with case studies in web-application security.

In pursuing these goals, there are possibilities for collaboration with
our high-profile academic and industrial partners.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Details about Employment*

PhD student positions are limited to five years and will then normally
include 20 per cent departmental work, mostly teaching duties. Salary
for the position is as specified in Chalmers? general agreement for
PhD student positions, currently around 23,000SEK a month before tax.

The positions are intended to start in spring or fall 2009.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Suitable Background*

Applicants must have a degree in Computing Science or in a related
subject with a strong Computing Science component. They must also have
a strong, documented interest in doing research. The ideal student for
the project will have strong background in both programming languages
and security.

You may even apply if you have not yet completed your degree, but
expect to do so before the position starts.

In order to improve gender balance, Chalmers welcomes in particular
applications from female candidates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*How to Apply*

Application can be submitted electronically following the
"Application details" and "Application procedure" guidelines at:
http://www.chalmers.se/cse/EN/news/vacancies/positions/ph-d-positions-in
