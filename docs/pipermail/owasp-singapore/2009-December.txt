Hi folks,

Just want to check whether there is any interest among all of you to 
meet this month and discuss about the OWASP Top 10 2010 RC1. It will be 
more of a roundtable / forum format, not so much of a speaker-audience 
format.
The AppSec preso will be shown for introduction.

If there is sufficient interest, we can meet on next Thu 10 Dec in our 
usual meeting place in Cairnhill CC.

Hope to hear from you.

Cheers
Onn Chee

Onn Chee,

I have a slide deck, which I am coincidentally presenting in Sydney,
Australia today, of the changes from 2007 to 2010 RC1 - let me know if
you are interested?

We had our discussion in the Swedish chapter yesterday, and we had
some opinions on how it could be made better. I won't go into details
what we discussed so you can go into a similar session with a clear
mind.

In my opinion you should meet up and discuss the OWASP Top 10 2010
RC1, it was very rewarding discussion.

Best regards
Michael Boman

That's why I had earlier proposed dual browser approach, where gaps in
one browser may not be present in another. :-)

Will also share a small trick on how one can foil keyloggers and malware
that can crack stored passwords when submitting credentials via web
browsers in today's meetup. ;-)

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Findings on Google Chrome/Chromium "Incognito"
	mode
Message-ID: <4B2F0A3A.8070502@usa.net>

Hi folks,

I believe all of you know that Chrome/Chromium comes with the
"Incognito" window which purportedly allows private browsing.

While testing the Chrome/Chromium browser on Linux, I discovered that
browsing history, even when Incognito mode is enabled, does get stored
in your local machine.

These are the files you need to wipe to ensure 100% privacy:

*_Chrome_*

Under your /home/<username>/.config/google-chrome/Default folder, remove

Archived*
Cookies
Current*
History*
Last*
Thumbnails
Visited*
Web*

*_Chromium_*

Under your /home/<username>/.config/chromium/Default folder, remove

Archived*
Cookies
Current*
History*
Last*
Thumbnails
Visited*
Web*
Local Storage/*

To the best of my knowledge, there is no impact when the above files are
deleted as the Chrome/Chromium browser will re-create these files.

Recommend to use secure wipe commands to delete such files to really
leave no trail of your web history.


Have a safe Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Cheers
Onn Chee

Hi Anton,

Thanks for sharing too. :-)

The version of Chromium I am using is
chromium-4.0.252.0-0.1.20091119svn32498.fc12.i686
As you can see, the Chromium package I tested was built for Fedora 12.
It looks like an older version compared to yours, so maybe your version
has resolved this.

Nevertheless, you can do this test.

1) Delete the suggested files
2) Launch Chromium in incognito mode
3) Check whether the files are and note down their default sizes
4) Start browsing
5) Close Chromium
6) Check whether the files created in Point 3 grow in sizes.

(A number of the files are SQLitev3 files.)

If the files do not grow in size at Pt 6, I think you can assume that
your web history is not archived.
Nevertheless, it should not hurt you if you wish to wipe these files
too. ;-)

Cheers
Onn Chee

Hi,

There has been a breakthrough on GSM network eardropping.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/28/gsm_eavesdropping_breakthrough/

I wonder how safe is Singapore GSM network. I highly doubt Singapore GSM
network is on A5/3 encryption standard. Anyone can comments on this?
