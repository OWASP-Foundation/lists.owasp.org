Hi everyone,

I will like to thank Thomas, Ben and Grug of Coseinc for a wonderful

Hope to see you all again in our next meetup!

Cheers

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Discount for security meetup to attend SyScan'10
	Singapore
Message-ID: <4BF21C74.4030105@usa.net>

Hi everyone,

Thomas from COSEINC is offering discounts for all OWASP/SSMG members to
attend SyScan 2010.
Many thanks to Thomas!

All registered members of your security meetup group will enjoy a 10%
discount to attend SyScan'10 Singapore (http://www.syscan.org).
In addition, instead of individual registration, we can register as a
group and enjoy an additional 10% discount.
In another words, if there are 5 members who sign in May 2010, each
member needs to pay only S$688.50.

For group registrations, I will be consolidating.

Do reply asap!
Cheers.

Regards
Onn Chee

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] So are we being too selfish in highlighting the
 cloud security risks? - Cloud Computing Can Cut Security Costs
Message-ID: <4BFC6E57.60304@usa.net>

http://www.cfoinnovation.com/content/cloud-computing-can-cut-security-costs?utm_source=lyris&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=cfo_weekly&section=features

Andrew Milroy of business and technology research firm Frost & Sullivan
thinks this may be why many in IT are dissuading businesses from going
to the cloud

What is your view?

Are we being selfish to highlight the risks?
