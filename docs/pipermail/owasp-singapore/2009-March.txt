Hi All,

 

I am very new to application security. My background is mostly SAP security. Im interested to know what could possibly the reason for this glitch? What could have been done to prevent this? And lastly, how to catch this glitch during testing? Any advise would be appreciated. Thanks!


Regards,
Ruel Montallana

Hi folks,

If there is enough interest, I can share on protecting against
information leakage from web servers for the April meetup.
I will share on best practices to adopt during development and best
practices to adopt in production environment.
Anonymised examples of information leakage from web servers in Singapore
will also be shared.

So how many of you are interested?

Regards
Onn Chee

Hi folks,

Just to follow up on Eugene's email, I will create the April event on

You can just RSVP yes to the event.

Thank you for all your support!

Hi folks,

As Rick is not available due to a last minute biz trip next week, he has
requested for a switch of slots with my April presentation.
In other words, I will present on March 12 while Rick will present on
April 9.

Any naysayers?

Onn Chee, sorry that I have a last minute biz trip next week and will
only return on Thursday later in the afternoon. I am not sure whether
I can make it for the meetup talk. Is it possible to swap your Web DLP
session with my vendor management talk?

regards,
Rick

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Singapore's first online voice for IS-related
 issues, aka "Stomp" for IS issues
Message-ID: <49BBA1D9.4000901@usa.net>

Hi everyone,

As mentioned in Thursday's meetup, my company has set up a "Stomp-like"
site, "Because I Matter" @ http://community.resolvo.com, for IS pros and
even general public to disclose and share infosec incidents. For those
of us who find that there is no avenue to raise your concerns about IS
matters here in Singapore, "Because I Matter" is for you. Feel free to
share pictures or video demos of any security issues on this community site.

We also welcome people who are interested to become group moderators and
help to drive awareness in a specific area of IS.

Do note there is some proper rules to adhere to while sharing
- no exact URL or personal info should be exposed in full, though the
identity of organisation can be disclosed.
- use layman terms and include pictures or videos as much as possible as
the non-IS-trained, general public may be reading the site.

Lastly, this site should not be a replica of CERT sites where
vulnerabilities are disclosed in very technical terms.
However, if some one have pictures or videos of how the vulnerabilities
can manifest, they are welcome to post such content to help educate the
public.

Hope to see all of you coming on board to build the Singapore's first
online voice for IS folks.

Let the world hears us speak!

Cheers!
Onn Chee

WORM_Downad.KK ?Activates on April Fool?s Day 
March 23, 2009  

  




Dear customers,

 

Trend Micro would like to caution about a possible widespread infection on April Fool?s day. Please read the details and recommended actions below for your information.


  

Details 


Worm_downad had infected more than 15 million computers, making it one of the widespread infections in recent times.

 

A new variant of worm_downad (aka Conficker) is expected to be launched on April Fool?s day.

Trend Micro detects this new variant as worm_downad.kk.  More information can be found at http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_DOWNAD.KK&VSect=T.  Trend Micro detects this malware starting with pattern file 5.885.00.  

 

Compared to the old variants, worm_downad.kk is more sophisticated.  Here are a few of the payloads :


Connects to various time servers to determine the current date and time.
Register itself as a system service to ensure auto execution every startup.
Deletes a registry key to prevent system startup in safe mode.
Terminates security-related processes (i.e. procexp, regmon, autoruns, gmer etc.)
Blocks access to security and antivirus websites.
Generates 50,000 malicious URLs and attempts to connect to around 500 random generated URLs at a time.
_________________________________________________________________________________

Recommended Action


Enable Web Threat Protection
Make sure that you have the latest virus definitions (at least pattern file 5.885 .00 )
Run a FULL system scan to ensure that malware does not exist on your PC

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] [Fwd: HP Offers Free Web Security Tool to Help
 Businesses Guard Against Malicious Hackers]
Message-ID: <49D189C3.2060004@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Below is a free security tool for Flash/Flex developers from HP.
Too bad, it only runs on Windows, not Mac or Linux.

Like to hear your views after using this tool.

Cheers.

PS: This is not a paid advertisement by HP.
It should be ok as long as we are sharing free, non-commercial things.
If this is a commercial, paid product, then my stand will be different.

Hi,

 

Please be inform that we recently launched the HP SWFScan
<http://www.hp.com/go/swfscan>, a free tool to help Flash developers
protect their websites against unintended application security
vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of hackers accessing sensitive data.

 

HP SWFScan allows Flash developers to deliver more secure code without
becoming security experts. The tool is the first of its kind to
decompile applications developed with the Flash platform and perform
static analysis to understand their behaviors. This helps identify
vulnerabilities that lie under the surface of an application and are not
detectable with traditional dynamic methods.

 

A free download of HP SWFScan is available at www.hp.com/go/swfscan
<http://www.hp.com/go/swfscan>.

 

This is a great yet free tool for flash developers. Can you help to
promote this free tool to your members by listing it in your OWASP local
chapter or newsletter?

 

Thank you and we look forward to hearing from you.
