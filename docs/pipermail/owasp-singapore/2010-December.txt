Hi,

Anyone heard of this company called Cyber-Ark before? Any good review on it?

http://www.cyber-ark.com

It provides a very good way of 2FA. Seems the SG bank is using it.

We are using deploying it.
Depending on your environment, it is sometimes not so straight forward and dependent on your intended use.

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for the quick reply.

I heard the implementation are complicated. Is it true?

Do you have any whitepaper that explains how the cyberark solution works?

Hi Donald,

You may also want to look at BeyondTrust solutions too
(http://www.beyondtrust.com/)

I understand their solutions are also used by the FSI sector.

Hi folks,

Some thoughts to share with all of you.

We should start running joint meetups with developer groups to more effectively spread the security by design message.

If you have connections to the .Net, Java, PHP and Flex User Groups, feel free to link us up.

Also, if you are conversant in any of these languages, conversant in secure coding and will like to share, do come forward  to volunteer to present in the joint meetups.

Have a safe and secure festive season.

Hi Daniel,

We are using Cyber-Ark for privilege accounts management.

A quick overview of what cyber-ark can do is:

1. Privilege account managements - Main function
2. Secure document vault for document access and sharing
3. APIs for applications and scripts to call for password retrieval. (remove hardcoding, properties file, ini file, etc risk).
4. Linux super user privilege access management, logging and auditing (a more powerful SUDO without the need for sudoers file)
5. Allows monitoring and video recording playback for activities


You will certainly require professional service to understand and to streamline the cyber-ark process into your working environment.

Regards,
Andrew Chong

Hi Andrew

I gather you were replying to Donald right ?

Donald

You can find the Cyber-ark white papers here: http://www.cyber-ark.com/constants/white-papers.asp

Depending on the platforms that you intend to the deploy it there have been times during the deployment ? the passwords went out of sync (wintel/unix), which was a bit of a nightmare for us, performance is not very satisfactory ? its slow for our administrators  to raise request.

Our intended/current deployment apart from the standard privilege IDs from our Wintel/Unix environment and also for any passwords (it could be application privilege IDs, macros for critical spreadsheets, etc) that are currently under ?dual? control (typically that means for us a split password in an envelope)- we?d probably create separate vaults for these.

Cheers
Daniel

Hi Daniel, Andrew,

Thanks for the quick reply.

The reviews given so far is not very smooth sail during the implementation.
If the decision is to adopt this solution, proper planning has to be put in
place in case things went wrong.

Overall, do you guys think is it worth the trouble to implementing such
solution?

In the meantime, I will go ahead and read through the white papers first on
the solution and implementation process.

@Onn-Chee, are you using the services from BeyondTrust?

Absolutely yes to pursue such a solution . But which you select pls PoC it extensively before making the decision.

Any project has its pitfalls proper planning and understanding your environment are almost half the battle.

Daniel

Hi Daniel, Andrew,

Thanks for the quick reply.

The reviews given so far is not very smooth sail during the implementation. If the decision is to adopt this solution, proper planning has to be put in place in case things went wrong.

Overall, do you guys think is it worth the trouble to implementing such solution?

In the meantime, I will go ahead and read through the white papers first on the solution and implementation process.

@Onn-Chee, are you using the services from BeyondTrust?

Donald

You can find the Cyber-ark white papers here: http://www.cyber-ark.com/constants/white-papers.asp

Depending on the platforms that you intend to the deploy it there have been times during the deployment ? the passwords went out of sync (wintel/unix), which was a bit of a nightmare for us, performance is not very satisfactory ? its slow for our administrators  to raise request.

Our intended/current deployment apart from the standard privilege IDs from our Wintel/Unix environment and also for any passwords (it could be application privilege IDs, macros for critical spreadsheets, etc) that are currently under ?dual? control (typically that means for us a split password in an envelope)- we?d probably create separate vaults for these.

Cheers

Hi Daniel,

We are using Cyber-Ark for privilege accounts management.

A quick overview of what cyber-ark can do is:

1. Privilege account managements - Main function
2. Secure document vault for document access and sharing
3. APIs for applications and scripts to call for password retrieval. (remove hardcoding, properties file, ini file, etc risk).
4. Linux super user privilege access management, logging and auditing (a more powerful SUDO without the need for sudoers file)
5. Allows monitoring and video recording playback for activities


You will certainly require professional service to understand and to streamline the cyber-ark process into your working environment.

Regards,
Andrew Chong

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for the quick reply.

I heard the implementation are complicated. Is it true?

Do you have any whitepaper that explains how the cyberark solution works?

Donald

Hi Donald,

Let me just say I have evaluated both.
I will keep my recommendation offline, so as not to be seen as promoting
any product.

You have my personal email, so you can contact me privately.

Message-ID: <4D02ED32.9010601@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Please share this to all your friends or associates who had installed
LOIC or are considering to join in the "fun".

Our CMA has this section (Section 7) "Unauthorised obstruction of use of
computer" which can be construed to cover DDOS attacks.

So it is illegal and is a criminal offence for any Singapore resident to
use LOIC to join in the WIkileaks DDOS wars.

So are we still going to let insecure codes go live?


http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/18/gawker_hack_aftermath/

"Having looked at the Gawker PHP source, I'm shocked it hasn't happened
sooner," Mike Bailey, who specializes in web-application security
recently tweeted
<https://twitter.com/#%21/mckt_/status/14187457570414592>. "Test code
all over the place, bugs galore."

"Gonna go ahead and make a prediction: Nothing short of a full site
rewrite is going to keep Gawker online at this point," he said in
another message <https://twitter.com/#%21/mckt_/status/14188068114268160>.

Another amateur goof was the use of DES, or Data Encryption Standard, to
protect some 1.5 million account passwords despite long-known weakness
in the hashing algorithm. As a result, the attackers were able to
retrieve the first eight characters of plaintext for each one.


"On all of our sites, we will be introducing several new features to our
commenting system to acknowledge the reality that we have lost the
commenters' trust and don't deserve it back," he wrote. "We should not
be in the business of collecting and storing personal information, and
our objective is to migrate our platform away from any personal data
dependencies (like email & password). ?

In-Reply-To: <4D132A4D.3040906@resolvo.com>
References: <4D132A4D.3040906@resolvo.com>
Message-ID: <4D132B2E.3070804@usa.net>

Solution: Install EMET and protect the iexplore.exe process.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/23/ms_zero_day/

Microsoft warned on Wednesday of a new zero-day vulnerability in
Internet Explorer.

The flaw creates a means for hackers to inject malware onto vulnerable
systems, providing surfers are first tricked into visiting booby-trapped
websites. As such the flaw poses a severe drive-by download risk.

All established version of IE (from 6 to 8) are affected. It's unclear
whether or not the IE 9 beta is similarly vulnerable. The flaw
reportedly <http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2010/3156> involves
the handling of Cascading Style Sheets by Microsoft's browser software.
The bug first came to light on the seclists.org <http://seclists.org/>
full disclosure mailing list earlier this month

A module exploiting the bug -- which is noteworthy because it defeats
Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomisation
(ASLR) security defences in Microsoft products -- has been added by the
Metasploit project

No patch is available but Redmond has published an advisory
<http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/22/new-internet-explorer-vulnerability-affecting-all-versions-of-ie.aspx>
explaining how to mitigate against possible attack.

A more detailed discussion of the flaw can be found in a blog post by
Paul Duckin of Sophos here
<http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2010/12/23/internet-explorer-zero-day-exploit-explanation-and-mitigation>.
