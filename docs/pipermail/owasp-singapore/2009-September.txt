Wow, I got like 4 copies of the same email ;)

The reasons are pretty similar I'd say. One cannot assume that just because
it's internal access only, no one from outside can access the app (think
botnets, CSRF).  Furthermore there're human problems that need to be thought
out and guarded against, either by genuine mistakes/user idiosyncracies, or
by the typical disgruntled employee.

Good example of an "internal only" app still being vulnerable from outside:

Hi Fong Kai,

Yes, you are right. The network admin joined the company 1 week later after
the employee left the company. It would be quite impossible to hijack the
user session since they don't even met before. My friend told me the network
admin was tasked to carry out an investigation on the ex-exmployee on any
unauthorized email sent to his personal email.

Could it be possible that the network admin the employee windows domain
password, and then found the domain password works for his yahoo email
account? I believe most of the people would use the same password for most
of his email accounts.

---
Hi all,

Yup, I also agree the possibility is endless. It is scary for the company to
be able to hack into the employee personal email because he/she has accessed
it before in the company network. Does the company network logged such
sensitive information in the network traffics? Any network admin can
comments on this? Is it even possible to find the user email and password
even if it is SSL encrypted using the network log?

Recently, I found a youtube clip on hacking into someone's yahoo email
account using the profile view method via yahoo messenger. I wonder if this
clip something that is real or a fake. Anyone came by this clip before? Is
it real?

It seems to be becoming very real that accessing personal email via the
company network is a dangerous and insecure even if the site is SSL
encrypted. One would never know if someone is watching on his network access
without his/her knowledge.


Regards,
Donald

Using the same password is a HIGH possibility. Ask around, I am sure most
of us is guilty to some extend.
However, I want to point out that what the admin is doing is probably in
some grey area or already considered illegal. The company has every right
to investigate the corporate email etc, but hacking into the employee's
personal email would probably be very hard to justify, especially if it is
done without the knowledge of the ex-employee.

Hi Fong Kai,

Yes, you are right. The network admin joined the company 1 week later after
the employee left the company. It would be quite impossible to hijack the
user session since they don't even met before. My friend told me the
network admin was tasked to carry out an investigation on the ex-exmployee
on any unauthorized email sent to his personal email.

Could it be possible that the network admin the employee windows domain
password, and then found the domain password works for his yahoo email
account? I believe most of the people would use the same password for most
of his email accounts.

---
Hi all,

Yup, I also agree the possibility is endless. It is scary for the company
to be able to hack into the employee personal email because he/she has
accessed it before in the company network. Does the company network logged
such sensitive information in the network traffics? Any network admin can
comments on this? Is it even possible to find the user email and password
even if it is SSL encrypted using the network log?

Recently, I found a youtube clip on hacking into someone's yahoo email
account using the profile view method via yahoo messenger. I wonder if this
clip something that is real or a fake. Anyone came by this clip before? Is
it real?

It seems to be becoming very real that accessing personal email via the
company network is a dangerous and insecure even if the site is SSL
encrypted. One would never know if someone is watching on his network
access without his/her knowledge.


Regards,
Donald

  Just to add on,
  In this situation, if I am put into the position to get the account ASAP,
  I
  would use social engineering to archive it. One simple way is to
  "convince"
  the (robot) administrator that you need to recover your password.

  I am not sure if I should post this, but I guess it probably no longer
  works anyway. One of the way to "craft" the email to the robot admin so
  that it nicely gives you the (resetted) password of the target account.
  It
  (used) to work on many mail server. Well, another common use of this
  tactics also created a lot of "cases" for my friends in the SPF due to
  hijacking of accounts in popular MMORPG.

  ?Hi,

  ?First time replying here. Just my 2 cents, I think he specifically
  ?mentioned that the Admin joined the company after the victim left the
  ?company.

  ?If that is the case, then the Admin wouldn't have been able to hijack
  any
  ?session. Please correct me if I am wrong.

  ?If there is no physical means to obtain the information (post-it notes
  for
  ?example =) ), then could it be possible that the company keeps a history
  ?of all information passing the gateway? I know my company keep tracks of
  ?the websites that the employee's visit. However, I do not know if they
  ?keep a log of additional information passed.

  ?Also, considering that the victim 'left' the company, usually the Admin
  ?would be required to 'cleanup' the workstation that the victim was
  using.
  ?The Admin could have tapped into the PC itself to retrieve the
  ?'remembered' passwords. The possibility is endless.

  ?I am not a professional when it comes to security, just my 2 cents and
  ?someone please correct me if I am thinking in the wrong direction.

  ?Thank you.

  ?Regards,
  ?Fong Kai

  ? ? The following could had happened:

  ? ? 1. The user did not login using SSL, which makes all username and
  ?password
  ? ? non-encrypted.
  ? ? 2. The administrator simple hijacked the session to obtain a valid

Ruel,

Internal Web Apps would be exploited by internal staff then :)

Their robustness would depend on if they were developed in house or
purchased from a vendor who has multiple deployments of the same web app
(based on say LAMP infrastructure for example).

Microsoft still does not acknowledge a weakness
<https://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/073009-more-holes-found-in-webs.html>
in its Internet Explorer browser that was pointed out seven weeks ago
and enables attackers to hijack what are supposed to be secure Web
sessions.

The company says it is still evaluating whether the weakness exists, but
Apple, which bases its Safari for Windows browser on Microsoft code,
says Safari for Windows has the weakness and the Microsoft code is the
reason. If Microsoft doesn't fix the problem, Apple can't fix it on its
own, Apple says. Apple has fixed the problem for Safari for Macs

Question: Is SMB also activated on the web edition of Windows 2008?
I can understand SMB being activated for workstations, domain
controllers and other internal facing servers.
But I don't see any reason why SMB is activated on public web-facing
servers.

Hi Ruel,

The points raised in the ASVS can also be applied to GUI applications.
Strictly speaking, web is also a presentation, aka GUI, layer. :-)

Websense Security Labs(TM) ThreatSeeker(TM) Network has discovered that
search engine results for information on how to download Microsoft's
recently released Security Essentials tool are returning links to Web
sites that serve rogue AV.

Malware authors have used Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques to
mix rogue search results in with legitimate results. For example, one of
the rogue links is directly under a MSDN blog entry discussing Microsoft
Security Essentials. The rogue redirects are hosted on compromised Web
sites, including a Canadian publisher's Web site and the British Travel
Health Association.

When a user browses to the compromised Web sites, so long as they have
been referred by a search engine, they are redirected to malicious Web
sites with domain names such as computer-scanner21 and
computervirusscanner31.
