<PRE>Dear fellow OWASP memebers,
&#160;
Please accept apologies as message is directed&#160;at members who are still a member of the (ISC)2.
&#160;
Fellow (ISC)2 members, you would have received email in regards to the election&#160;for 2008 (ISC)2 Board of Directors&#8207;. One of the candidates is Freddy Tan who is also one of our own.
&#160;
Not only he is from Singapore, he is also the only one from Asia.
&#160;
I would strongly urge you to exercise your right to vote for Freddy&#160;as this will give this part of the world a chance to be heard.
&#160;
Please show your support for Freddy too by encouraging fellow (ISC)2 members who you know are less active or have not cast their vote if you have voted.
&#160;
May you all have a pleasant weekend.
&#160;
Thank you.
&#160;
&#160;
Warm regards,
Dick Wong
