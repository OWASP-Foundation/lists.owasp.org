<PRE>Hi Michael,

This is a great idea!

I can see that having such talks (though they could be sales talk) will
help our community to have a better understanding of certifications that
are most relevant to IS.

Any one else who is for having a series of talks on IS certifications?

</I>&gt;<i> extended to all the relevant companies (and not just the ones we have
</I>&gt;<i> discussed so far), and it should bring up a number of set points apart

</I>&gt;<i> (budget, time restrains etc) they should be allowed to leave a written
</I>&gt;<i> response to the agreed questions which we can upload to the Meetup.com
</I>&gt;<i> site for all to access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My recommendation of points to bring up:
</I>&gt;<i> * Prerequisites of the certifications
</I>&gt;<i> * Coverage
</I>&gt;<i> * How many are certified to date (at most 1 year old figures)
</I>&gt;<i> * How to attain it (course, self study [recommended reading list],
</I>&gt;<i> online, certified exam centers)
</I>&gt;<i> * Cost (for the exam itself)
</I>&gt;<i> * Does the certification expire? How to renew?
</I>&gt;<i> * Benefits for the individual
</I>&gt;<i> * Benefits for the organisation
</I>&gt;<i> (please add more if you think it's missing something)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> List of certification bodies to involve (in no particular order):
</I>&gt;<i> * GIAC (SANS)
</I>&gt;<i> * CompTIA
</I>&gt;<i> * ISC^2
</I>&gt;<i> * EC-Council
</I>&gt;<i> * ISECOM
</I>&gt;<i> (please add more if you think it's missing something)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As this meetup group originated as a OWASP Singapore meeting I say it
</I>&gt;<i> is only fair to have Onn Chee spend a few minutes talking about the
</I>&gt;<i> resources OWASP has to offer, because they have a lot of interesting
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is also a bunch of vendor-centric security certifications, not
</I>&gt;<i> sure how well that will go with you guys but I personally think
</I>&gt;<i> generic certifications are of more value then a vendor-centric one
</I>&gt;<i> (what if your next company isn't running CISCO or CheckPoint
</I>&gt;<i> gear?)////.
</I>&gt;<i>
