Hi All,

 

As some of you may know, I am very new to Information Security particularly Application Security. My goal is to work towards becoming an expert in 3 to 4 yrs time. I know its a huge goal but Im willing to spend time and effort to reach it. Since I know OWASP is the de-facto leader in application security I hope someone can guide me on how to become an expert in this field. Can anyone advise someone who is in the entry-level of application security? Thanks!

 

Regards,
Ruel Montallana

Hi Ruel,

It depends on your background and where you want to go in
application/software security.

Here are 3 excellent appsec podcast series:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_PodCast
http://www.cigital.com/silverbullet/
http://www.imperva.com/resources/podcasts.asp

At the beginning of most of these podcasts (65+), the guest is asked
how they got started in software security.

Your question will be answered.

Stephen

Hi Ruel,

Welcome to the OWASP chapter!

I agree with Stephen opinions. 

You should treat this chapter as another place for you to learn more about security. There are many ways to secure a software or infrastructure, and really depends how you understand and approach it.

Security in IT is a broad topic, and you should start off the subject most interests you, and expand from there. It is quite difficult to be expert in every area, but its important for you to understand on the security nature you are dealing in.

Enjoy your learning with us. :)


Regards,
Donald

Hi folks,

I did an online payment recently via my non-default web browser, Opera,
and I encountered the attached pop-up warning.

Seems like Opera feels that TLSv1 is weak.

Any one care to enlighten me why?

Thanks.

Thanks for the update, Ryan.

However, other browsers, such as FF and IE, seem to accept such short
key length as ok.

There seems to be no standard treatment of what is deemed as
insufficient and what is sufficient encryption between browsers.

Will like to hear the feedback from the group regarding this.

Looks like someone else has replied. In any case, the reason why Opera
behaves so is summaries as follows:

This dialog will pop up if:


?     SSL v2
?     Encryption methods using 40 or 56 bit keys
?     Key exchange performed using RSA or Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys less
than 900 bits long. (Keys less than 1020 bits long will reduce the security
level by one point).

RSA/DH keys shorter than 900 bits


These keys are used to protect the encryption keys for all transactions
with the server, if these keys are broken all communcition that has been
exchanged with the server from the time the key was created until it is
replaced sometime in the future is a wide open book. And that is not all:
Once these keys are broken an attacker can modify the information exchanged
between you and the server, and there is no way to detect such changes in
the protocol! The only way to find out is to check the information you have
with the information available at the server, and that checking must be
done in a different fashion since you cannot trust the protocol for such
audits.


Several years ago a 512 bit RSA key was broken in, effectively, 10-12 weeks
(they used 7-8 months computing by night on a few hundred workstations).
Today the same job could probably be done in less than 4 weeks, possibly
much less depending on how many computers you throw at it, and other
improvements in the art of factoring large numbers). Since such a key is
usually used for at least one year that means that keys of this length was
no longer adequate protection for any information that needed to be kept
secure for more than a few weeks.


With 8-cores desktops nowadays, script kiddies can probably do it within a
fortnight.

Thanks for the insight, Winston.

This weak encryption is being used by the IRAS payment vendor for
e-payment of taxes.

Any one in the group who knows the person(s) responsible in IRAS?
We need to inform them asap.

*Sign* Another case of SG Govt agency being short-changed by their
outsourced vendor beside the one I reported previously.
I don't find it amusing that govt vendors keep short-changing basic
security at the expense of taxpayers.

Martin, can you help inform IRAS about this?

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] [security-77] Is Opera web browser being too
	strict in this case?
Message-ID: <9ee89e4e51uitwml3xhckbuh.1243598360974@email.android.com>

Hi,

It will be good if IRAS internally review their web application in term security annually. It is 1 of the requirement from PCI.

I've notice many govt agency don't care much abt their web application once it launch live. That is a sad case.


Regards,
Donald

Hi Ray,

I will strongly recommend against using Wireless at SG, as anyone can
masquerade their rogue AP as Wireless at SG.

3G broadband is a much safer option.

Again, pardon my limited legal knowledge, but it may not be an offence
to masquerade Wireless at SG unless IDA or the providers complain.
Akin to our previous thread on the cyber-squatting of domain names.

Hi Onn Chee,

Wireless at SG is risky being a public wifi network, but for some other  
uses (like non-personal/secret sites, or https sites with working  
certs) it's still ok.

Another way is to use VPN but not everyone knows how to use, or cares  
to.

If it's really not illegal to run a fake AP, maybe we should be  
enforcing/educating even more the use of encryption... Or getting the  
law makers to amend the CMA :P

Ray.

Hi,

I agree with Onn Chee on against the idea of using a public wireless AP like Wireless at SG. However, I also support IDA movement to promote free wireless usage around Singapore.

The impt point lacking is really educating the public the risk in using public AP. A simple guy like me, I can sniff all packets going through the standard Wireless at SG AP once I'm connected. That means I stands a chance to gain access valuable personal information if the website the public is accessing is not secure at all by default.

IDA must find another solution to ensure the public is accessing a genuine Wireless at SG other than just a simple login authentication it currently have. It is a tricky problem as the public is not that tech savy, nor have the knowledge what risk is it, n when it will affect them.

3G would not have this problem because it is sitting on top of GSM, which have a end to end security encryption protection on the data transfer. 

Could we raise this issue to IDA on this current problem?

Hi


I would like to inform you guys and gals a tool I created recently for
checking the strength of a SSL enabled web server. It is similar to
SSL Digger from Founstone.

You can download it from http://code.google.com/p/libre-tools/

All suggestions and feedback are welcome!

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] [security-77] Fake Wireless@SG AP at AMK?
In-Reply-To: <4A210A2C.20905@usa.net>
Message-ID: <OF3CAF9639.2A72D73F-ON482575C8.000E3828-482575C8.000FD8DD@eyi.com>

Since the Wireless at SG was brought up, I might as well mention here that I
had encounter at least 2 Rouge AP running with the same SSID. One of them
is within City Hall and the other is in CBD area close to some banks.

The interesting part is that one of them does not have the standard login
at all. Free internet so to speak.

The other is more malicious in design. It has the exact same page copied
from the original site, including the login. I only spotted it because it
looks different on my specific device. The Rouge AP installer probably did
not expect me to use this device to browse to his AP. In his case, I did
not log in for obvious reasons.

So I urges everyone to be extra careful in using free wifi and assume at
all times free wifi cannot be trusted and you should not submit any
information what may compromise yourself over these networks.

Hi Ray,

I will strongly recommend against using Wireless at SG, as anyone can
masquerade their rogue AP as Wireless at SG.

3G broadband is a much safer option.

Again, pardon my limited legal knowledge, but it may not be an offence
to masquerade Wireless at SG unless IDA or the providers complain.
Akin to our previous thread on the cyber-squatting of domain names.
