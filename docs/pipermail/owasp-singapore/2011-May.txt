Subject: [Owasp-singapore] *UPDATE* 2012 Global Board of Directors -
	Elections
Message-ID: <4DBFE01B.8040209@usa.net>

The 2012 OWASP Elections of Officers is coming up for OWASP Foundation
Global Board of Directors.

FAQ:

Who can run for election:

Answer: ANY current OWASP Individual Member ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership )

====

Step #2 

Review https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2011Election   <--- important


Every member of OWASP Foundation understands that the WIKI is KEY to the community.. so edit and add yourself to the as a candidate and link to your BIO and modify to include a  "Why Me Profile" - you do have a wiki account right?

Between NOW and June, candidates will have had time to flush out who has the TIME and is SERIOUS for the role.  Some members may drop out of the race and endorse other candidates.  When we reach the OWASP Global AppSec EU ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2011 ) we will announce officially the candidates for the election and then move to a election by membership administrated by the OWASP Global Membership Committee.

====

So.... in summary NOW is the time to make this a topic at your next chapter meeting (who will you endorse or nominate your chapter/project leader) and obtain support from global committees of your accomplishments.

Thanks in advance for your support of a democratic and rough consensus model.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Sony: 'PSN attacker exploited known vulnerability'
Message-ID: <4DC18DB2.1050107@usa.net>

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/01/psn_service_restoration/

"Sony?s Shinji Hasejima, Sony?s CIO, told Sony?s apologetic news
conference that the attack was based on a ?known vulnerability? in the
non-specified Web application server platform used in the PSN. However,
he declined to stipulate what platform/s were used or what vulnerability
was exploited, on the basis that disclosure might expose other users to
attack."

Guess that they forgot to patch their Apache web server. ;-)

Not really. If it is on voip, it is a viable option. Without using any
cards, token, the solution is complete. The acknowledgement is done by
pressing the key when the call comes in to the mobile phone.

"Google recently became the only browser marker to explicitly join
lobbyists opposing a proposed California law
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/05/google_backs_do_not_track_opposition/>
that would have much the same effect.

Mozilla and Microsoft have added do-not-track technology to their
browsers, and Apple reportedly has done the same with its Safari browser
for the Lion version of OS X. Google, by contrast, has promoted a
plug-in for opting-out of tracking cookies from multiple advertising
networks in Chrome."

Learn how to conduct reconnaissance without violating the law. ;-)

"Several flaws remain, according to Bumgarner, who said he had viewed
only parts of Sony's network that were *visible over the Internet* and
*did not attempt to break in to password-protected sites or exploit any
vulnerabilities*."

Please do not conduct injection tests on sites which have suspected
security vulnerabilities, else you expose yourself to possible CMA charges.

This is FUD, these vulnerabilities are already disclosed and patches

Hi folks,

For those of you who like to have Craig's or Jukka's email address, do
drop me a note privately (do not spam the mailing list pls) so that I
can send the addresses to you.

Cheers

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] New PlayStation Network hack hijacks user accounts
Message-ID: <4DD458F9.2020603@usa.net>

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/18/sony_playstation_account_hijacking/

The exploit involved the bypass of a digital token system that Sony used
when users reset their PSN password. Attackers could carry out the
attack by visiting
https://store.playstation.com/accounts/reset/resetPassword.action?token
and then, in a separate browser tab, opening a different page on
us.playstation.com <http://us.playstation.com/> and following Sony's
reset procedure, which required only the date of birth and email address
associated with the account.

The attacker would then return to the original tab and, armed with the
browser cookie just issued by Sony's servers, complete an image
verification on the page. The attacker would then proceed to a scree
allowing him to change the victim's password.

"The page
https://store.playstation.com/accounts/reset/resetPassword.action?token,
acts as though you had clicked the unique link sent to you via Sony for
completing the second page's password reset," Pilkington said during a
discussion over instant message. He said it's "highly unlikely" the
exploit technique was discovered until Tuesday evening.

Be careful when surfing Sony sites, just to be safe.
