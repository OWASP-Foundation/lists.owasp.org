Well Onn Chee, I don't know what will you ask next but using GPF or General Purpose Fuzzer would do the job(cheap & value-added) that is to find those bugs but since it doesn't "talk" to the debugger directly that is monitoring the target proves to be one of the disadvantages.

A good resource to refer to which I recommend would be "Fuzzing: Brute Force Vulnerability Discovery".

Pishu

Thanks for the prompt reply, Pishu.

Just to clarify.
My questions are:

1) Have you used fuzzing?
2) If yes, what are your preferred fuzzers? Why?

Hi Onn Chee,

1) Yes I have used Fuzzers.
2) Depends on what I'm fuzzing. Is it a protocol or is it an application? There are 2 type of fuzzers or techniques. The first being generational and the other being mutational. I stick to GPF most of the time but I occasionally use PROTOS-SIP for fuzzing those VoIP devices and SPIKE Proxy for those pesky Web-Apps... ;)

Regards
Pishu

Personally I use SPIKE/Scully/tcpreplay-rewrite for protocol hackery and
Burp pro for Web apps. Good stuff.

Thank you for your strong response, folks.

I will like to sincerely invite all who are experienced in web / client
application fuzzing to conduct an intro session on fuzzing for the group.

The key objective is to educate and raise the awareness of fuzzing to
the local community so that we can see more secure software coming out
of Singapore. :-)

Any takers?

Beer on me. ;-)

I think Ben Nagy's presentation last year at Syscan was pretty informative...Maybe Thomas can arrange another one for the benefit for those who missed it last year...

Just my thoughts... ;)

I spoke too soon on that...

There's a *.ppt on COSEINC's about his presentation.

"Finding Microsoft Vulnerabilities by Fuzzing Binary Files with Ruby - A New Fuzzing Framework"

I think Ben Nagy's presentation last year at Syscan was pretty informative...Maybe Thomas can arrange another one for the benefit for those who missed it last year...

Just my thoughts... ;)

Thank you for your strong response, folks.

I will like to sincerely invite all who are experienced in web / client
application fuzzing to conduct an intro session on fuzzing for the group.

The key objective is to educate and raise the awareness of fuzzing to
the local community so that we can see more secure software coming out
of Singapore. :-)

Any takers?

Beer on me. ;-)

Regards
Onn Chee

Great!

So anyone wants to volunteer to present on fuzzing?

We can have one session on fuzzing for web apps and another session on
fuzzing for client apps / documents.

Hi Onn Chee,

How long do you propose such a session to be? 1hr tops or an indepth deep-dive which lasts 3hrs or so(Web-apps/client-apps/documents)? I think it would give people who intend to present a much more clearer picture on the how to tailor such a presentation. Also, the pre-requisites that the audience should have before coming for this session. Just my thoughts...

Regards
Pishu

Hi Pishu,

Our meetup sessions usually last for 2 to 1.5 hours.

It is up to the presenter to indicate some required prior knowledge for
the attendees, but I will advise that we do have novice members and even
students among our group.

We can always start off with an intro session and if there is a demand
for a deep-dive, we can arrange for another session for the deep-dive.

Hope the above replies answer your queries.

Cheers
Onn Chee

Our usual meetup session is about 2 hours including discussion. Since this
will be a first session dedicated to  Fuzzing techniques, I guess we are
open to any relevant topics and level of details and depth. What do you
