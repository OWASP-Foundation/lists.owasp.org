If your like me you, love to see measurable data that can point out obvious
trends and measurements/milestones of what is real and what is "FUD". 

Glad to see this finally get released today and wanted to share summary of
the stats information

===snip===

Data Overview
- 877 total websites
- Vast majority of websites assessed for vulnerabilities weekly
- Vulnerabilities classified according to WASC Threat Classification
- Vulnerability severity naming convention aligns with PCI-DSS
- Obtained between January 1, 2006 and December 1, 2008

Key Findings
- Total identified vulnerabilities (open & closed): 14,718
- Current open vulnerabilities: 5,283 (64% resolved)
- Historically, 82% of assessed websites have had at least one issue of
HIGH, CRITICAL, or URGENT severity
- 63% of assessed websites currently have issues of HIGH, CRITICAL, or
URGENT severity
- Historically, websites average 17 vulnerabilities identified during the
lifetime of the assessment cycle
- Websites currently average 6 open vulnerabilities
- Cross-Site Request Forgery gained two spots in the Top Ten moving to #8
- Vulnerability time-to-fix metrics are not changing, typically requiring
weeks to months to achieve resolution
- Roughly 50% of the most prevalent Urgent severity issues have been
resolved

If you have appsec research stats data please share - things you can do:
 
#1 - Join the OWASP Top 10 2009 Mailing list
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-topten

#2 - Review the OWASP Top 10 2009 Project and get involved

data collection.

FYI.

Again, the practice of using different browsers for general surfing and
sensitive access (internet banking) is recommended.

Just as Firefox, Opera or Safari are vulnerable to bugs, using different
browsers will avoid having any single vulnerability to "punch" a hole
straight through all your defense and avoid being overly reliant on a
single web browser.

Hello leaders, I'm really happy to announce a new documentation project
I started today. Our Top 10 most critical web app vulnerabilities is the
standard de facto when trying to summarize findings when you assess a
web application. And it is great.

Looking at source code assessment (or code review, or static analysis,
or whatever the name you want to use :-)), nothing like this exists.
Gary McGraw introduced the 7 kingdoms as taxonomy. I started looking at
this great job extending it to meet Owasp Top 10 like template.
I also used categories that I found useful to gather security code
review findings in.

That's why I started this Top 10 project. The goal is to provide
something useful in Owasp Code Review Guide while trying to organize
security issues and the second goal is to use it as Owasp Orizon default
library cookbooks in order to have a "fil rouge" from Code review guide
and the implementing tool. The Source code flaws Top 10 will be that fil
rouge.

I really hope that everyone interested will subscribe to mailing list
and give some contributions to this document I'd like to release as beta
quality project in the next AppSec Europe 2009 in Cracow.

ANNOUNCING THE NEW "OWASP TESTING GUIDE v3

OWASP is announcing the new OWASP Testing Guide v3. The project as
part of the OWASP Summer of Code, started on April 2008 reviewing the
version 2, improving it.
OWASP Testing Guide v3 is a 349 page book; we have split the set of
active tests in 9 sub-categories for a total of 66 controls to test
during the Web Application Testing activity.
Each control has an OWASP name, so for example a SQL Injection is
called: OWASP-DV-005, meaning that it is the 5th control of the Data
Validation category.
We got a dream team of 21 authors and 4 reviewers: after 6 months of
hard work and great team work we realized the v3.

We'd like to ask you to support OWASP to reach the following goals:

*** Continuously improve the guide.
The Guide is a "live" document: we always need your feedback!
Please join our testing mailing list and share your ideas:
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing

*** Promote the Testing Guide.
We would like to have some more media coverage on the guide, so
please, if you know somebody in there put them in touch.
If you have the chance, you can write an article about the Testing
Guide and the new OWASP Projects.
Also you can pick up the OWASP Testing Guide presentations and talk
about it in local conferences and Chapter meetings.
http://www.owasp.org/images/2/2c/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3.ppt

*** Add 'quotes' to the Guide.
We made a special 'quotes' pages for the Testing Guide.
Here we'd want to add all the comments and references to the Guide.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_Quotes

The OWASP Testing Guide includes a "best practice" penetration testing
framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a
"low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for
testing most common web application and web service security issues.
