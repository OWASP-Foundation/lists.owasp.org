<PRE>The 2012 OWASP Elections of Officers is coming up for OWASP Foundation
Global Board of Directors.

FAQ:

Who can run for election:

Answer: ANY current OWASP Individual Member ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A> )

====

Step #2 

Review <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2011Election">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2011Election</A>   &lt;--- important


Every member of OWASP Foundation understands that the WIKI is KEY to the community.. so edit and add yourself to the as a candidate and link to your BIO and modify to include a  &quot;Why Me Profile&quot; - you do have a wiki account right?

Between NOW and June, candidates will have had time to flush out who has the TIME and is SERIOUS for the role.  Some members may drop out of the race and endorse other candidates.  When we reach the OWASP Global AppSec EU ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2011">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2011</A> ) we will announce officially the candidates for the election and then move to a election by membership administrated by the OWASP Global Membership Committee.

====

So.... in summary NOW is the time to make this a topic at your next chapter meeting (who will you endorse or nominate your chapter/project leader) and obtain support from global committees of your accomplishments.

Thanks in advance for your support of a democratic and rough consensus model.
