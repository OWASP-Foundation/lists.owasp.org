Interestingly, NYT is recommending home users to drop IE....not sure how
MS will react.

On a separate note, maybe we can publish a "10 Ways to Stay Safe Online
in 2011" to help the public here in SG to stay safe online.

For better relevance, we can have separate lists for Win, Mac and Linux
desktop users.
