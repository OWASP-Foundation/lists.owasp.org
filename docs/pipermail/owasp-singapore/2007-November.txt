Ok.

Any objections if I book the venue today?
So far, we have less than 8 pax, but I estimate that each of us will pay
just around $10.

If I do not receive any objections by 5pm today, I will proceed to book.

Hi everyone,

FYI, GeekTerminal is not open on public holidays and this Thu is Deepvali.
Let me first send my well wishes to all our Hindu friends in OWASP
Singapore.

If everyone is agreeable, we can postpone it to next Thu 15 Nov.
Please reply asap.
Thanks.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Google as a password cracker - How to crack
 hashed passwords via Google
Message-ID: <4744EA21.6050104@usa.net>

http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2007/11/16/google-as-a-password-cracker/

Innovative use of Google to find out hashed passwords.

Again, the enforcement of complex passwords should reduce the likelihood
of having a similar match out there on Google.

GOT OWASP BOOKS?

Many of you have read the wiki used the OWASP published materials as
guides such as the Top 10 Guide, Testing Guide, CLASP for lifecyle and
many others

That may work for some of us g33ks however management likes to kill trees
(well not all of them right..) but like a hard copy printed book as a
"blueprint" of how something should be done or as a ref., or to give to a
employee and say "read this"

Well OWASP has done just that - all our books are now hardcopy published!

I am pleased to announce to the NYC Metro local chapter and shortly it
will be announced to the world of OWASP Books online - so order now before
the holiday rush ;)

Now you can get a professional bound book that you can give away to your
managers,developers,pen testers,audit department to help spread the word.

Online bookstore = http://stores.lulu.com/owasp

Shirts hats etc... http://www.cafepress.com/owasp

If you forget the links you can always go back to the wiki at
http://www.owasp.org to find them.

Dinis is also working on a buy a book, plant a tree program since we are
in a GREEN World ;)
