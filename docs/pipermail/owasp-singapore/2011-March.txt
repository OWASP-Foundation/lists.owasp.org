FYI, folks.

I encourage you to participate and contribute in this new OWASP project.

Cheers.



Leaders,

 

I am glad to announce we've just set a new project up -- the */OWASP
Software Security Assurance Process Project/*, led by */Mateo Mart?nez/*.

 

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Software_Security_Assurance_Process#tab=Project_Details
 

 

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Mateo_Mart%C3%ADnez

 

The project's purpose is "to outline mandatory and recommended processes
and practices to manage risks associated with applications. Software
Security is equally dependent on people, processes and technology. The
effectiveness of the OWASP Software Security Process is continuously
measured and is improved through feedback, threat landscape changes,
availability of new concepts and tools".

 

As always, your suggestions and contributions would be greatly
appreciated.   

 

Thanks,

- Paulo

 

Paulo Coimbra,

OWASP Project Manager <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Paulo_Coimbra>

 Security Conference (Singapore) on 5 May 2011
Message-ID: <4D7446FA.3030009@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Questex has kindly given 2 complimentary passes to OWASP members for the
Singapore event.
This event is free for senior IT executives from end user organisations,
but others will have to pay US$995.
For more details, please visit http://infosecurity.questexevents.net/home

Do note that only paid and registered OWASP members are entitled to the
2 complimentary passes.
First-come, first-serve basis.

If you are not a member yet, please sign up at

The benefits you get outweigh the US$50 OWASP membership fee.
Besides free complimentary passes, as OWASP members, you are also
entitled to free tech training at AppSec conferences and many other
benefits.
The math is so simple, so do sign up now!

Hi folks,

I will like to invite all of you to support this IDA's worthy movement
by asking your family and your colleagues/organisations to pledge their
support online.

Your organisation may pledge your support for free as an organisation
via the form below while individualsmay pledge via Facebook @

Do support this worthy cause for infosec.
Thank you for your support!

*Singapore?s 1^st Cyber Security Awareness Day*

Singapore?s 1^st Cyber Security Awareness Day will be launched on 13
April 2011, in conjunction with the Information Security Seminar 2011
(13 ? 14 April 2011), jointly organised by the Infocomm Development
Authority of Singapore (IDA), Association of Information Security
Professionals (AISP) and Cyber Security Awareness Alliance (Alliance).
While various awareness outreach efforts are carried out throughout the
year, the Awareness Day will serve as a nation-wide call-to-action to
take personal responsibility to ?Go safe online?.

The target is to draw at least 200,000 users to ?pledge? to change their
passwords to a strong password on the Awareness Day. For the build-up,
we are reaching out to the public, private and people sectors to raise
awareness and obtain their pledges. In addition, objective of the
Awareness Day and relevant security messages will be published on
traditional prints and online media to heighten the importance of cyber
security leading to the launch of the Awareness Day.

As users of infocomm technologies, we hope that you will respond to the
call-to-action on Cyber Security Awareness Day, by submitting your
pledge to the Alliance secretariat (i.e. cordelia_chee at ida.gov.sg
<mailto:cordelia_chee at ida.gov.sg>via the pledge form) by _18 March
2011_. Your assistance is also sought to help to spread the message and
encourage your business associates, family and friends to respond to the
call-to-action.

As infocomm becomes increasingly pervasive, it is imperative to raise
the awareness and adoption of essential cyber security practices among
users. Well-informed users will not only keep personal / organisation
assets and information secure but will also help to improve the overall
security of cyberspace. We look forward to your favourable reply. Thank you.

Charting New Frontiers, Information Security as an Enabler

 

/*G*//*uest of Honor -- Mr Lui Tuck Yew, Minister for Information,

Amidst the global backdrop of emerging infocomm security threats,
governments and organisations around the world are undergoing conceited
developments to enhance their infocomm security strategies. On the local
front, the Singapore Government has been proactive and innovative in our
approach to strengthen our infocomm security capabilities. 

The theme for this year's Seminar is "Charting New Frontiers,
Information Security as an Enabler" and centres on public, private and
people sector collaboration in enhancing our capabilities to prepare
Singapore against new and emerging infocomm security threats.

Not going to comment about the choice of IE or any other browser.

But will like to bring up the merit of dual browser approach in view of
security benefits.

"They [Google security team] reiterated Microsoft's advice that users
install the temporary fixit <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501696> as
soon as possible. A better course of action is to halt all usage of the
Internet Explorer browser, since that is the sole vector for exploits.
This may not be possible for users with custom applications that rely on
the Microsoft browser, but *even avoiding it while on social networking
sites is a good idea,* if at all possible."

Though I am sure that Google is not on these mailing lists, Google is
echoing the dual browser option too. ;-)

Hello folks,

I just want to give you a quick update on the OWASP Podcast Series.

We pushed out 3 shows so far this year:

1) OWASP Podcast 83 from Dave Ferguson talks about how to properly
implement the "Forgot Password" feature in web apps. I'm a fan of this
podcast and would like the series to move more and more in this
"prescriptive" direction. Dave's podcast was also the basis for the
OWASP Forgot Password cheat-sheet.

http://www.owasp.org/download/jmanico/owasp_podcast_83.mp3
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet

2) OWASP Podcast 82 from Dave Wichers. Dave is one of OWASP's board
members and donates a pretty insane amount of time assisting the OWASP
cause in a variety of ways (OWASP CFO, ASVS, Top Ten leader, etc, etc, etc).

http://www.owasp.org/download/jmanico/owasp_podcast_82.mp3
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Wichers

3) OWASP Podcast 81 is an older show from Brian Chess prior to HP's
purchase of Fortify. Brian talked about how software security issues are
no longer just about business risk - its now life and death.

http://www.owasp.org/download/jmanico/owasp_podcast_81.mp3

I hope you enjoy. Feedback is always appreciated.

Jim Manico

Hi there, 

Here is the second challenge to win a free entrance ticket to AppSec EU
2011!

*Jotto - The Game* 

The computer will think of a five letter word with unique letters. After
you attempt to guess the word, the computer will tell you whether you
guessed the word successfully, or how many of the letters in your word
match the computer's word. Keep on submitting five letter words until
you have guessed the computer's word.
In order to win an free ticket to AppSec EU 2011 you need to hack the
game & database of Jotto. 

Once you solve the exercises, please send us an email
to ireland at owasp.org <mailto:ireland at owasp.org> with your full name and
details on how you accomplished this goal. 

The first one who solves these exercises gets a free ticket to OWASP
AppSec EU 2011! 

Please visit http://www.appseceu.org/?page_id=273 to find out further
details about the challenge. 

A big THANKS goes to Mordecai for setting up and customizing the challenge. 

Thank you and best of luck everyone!

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Finally,
 an EU proposal that makes software vendors criminally responsible
 for defective (aka insecure) software products
Message-ID: <4D8A0CEE.2020601@usa.net>

Folks,

Finally found some like-minded folks in EU!

Check out
http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A7-2011-0038&language=EN

In the proposed amendments,

"(12a) The importance of European markets for online digital content is
increasing and therefore it should be clear that goods referred to in
this Directive also include digital products, such as downloads and
software."

"(d) the same or another defect has appeared within a short period of
time after the good was first repaired or replaced."

"(41) The consumer should not bear any costs for remedying the lack of
conformity, particularly the cost of postage, labour and materials.
Furthermore, the consumer should not compensate the trader for the use
of the defective goods. The consumer should be entitled to claim
damages, in accordance with provisions of applicable national law, for
any loss resulting from lack of conformity with the sales contract and
not remedied by the trader. It should be possible for such damages to
include non-pecuniary damages where applicable national law so provides."

That will make most of the EULA of corporate softwares illegal or
contradictory to the proposed directive.


Finally, as consumers (albeit in EU only), we can claim for damages from
use of insecure (==defective) software.
May even be able to claim refunds in "Furthermore, the consumer should
not compensate the trader for the use of the defective good."

In Singlish terms, Hoo Say Ah!

Hi folks,

With the impending Singapore's personal data protection law (coming in
2012), the privacy-focused website, http://www.infothatmatter.org, has
served its purpose in raising the awareness of lack of privacy
protection among organisations.

Once the law comes into place next year, any privacy leakage may become
a criminal case and be subjected to police investigation. With the
police taking over the enforcement, the public can escalate any leakage
directly to the police. Hence, there is no need for us to keep
http://www.infothatmatter.org as provide an avenue for the public to

Hi folks,

Due to a clash of schedule to AISP networking nite on 7 April, we have
postponed the April meet up to 20 April 7pm.

Appreciate your help to update your RSVP status for the 20 April meetup.

Thanks.

Regards
Onn Chee
