Hi folks,

You can do a nslookup test and you will find that beladen.net resolves 
to 127.0.0.1

Anyway, beladen.net is not a friendly site.
So no harm in blocking access to any sites with beladen.net.

You have been warned. ;-)

Hi Guys,

 

Just need your opinion/feedback or comment. We have implemented a "not so" sensitive web based application to use for our Reward program. Its an SaaS. The issues that I have uncovered is that it does not follow our password policy and that the logon credential is stored in the cookie. Meaning a user can login by just clicking on the "back" and "forward" button of the browser.

 

The business has provided a risk acceptance. But not sure how to respond on this. Any opinion/suggestion/feedback/comment?

 

Regards,
Ruel

Hi Ruel,

My personal view is to show to the "business" (whatever it means) a
simulated attack.
The same way how SCADA came to the limelight when a demonstration of how
an IS attack can be used to bring down power turbines.

But do stay within the law in your demo, e.g. using your own account and
etc.
If after showing the simulated attack to the "business" and they still
insist on status quo, then you have discharged your due diligence.
Document down what you have shown and what the final "business"
decisions are, so that there is full accountability.

Hope my $0.02 above helps.

Welcome to the land of "ostriches"!! ;-)
Speaking from experience, there are sadly too many "ostriches" in Singapore.
They thought their world is safe by ignoring the present.
If only that were true, we would be living in heaven. :-)

Hi Andrew,

Thanks for the layman explanation. Appreciate it a lot.
Good for ignorants like me. :-)

I still see some challenges with this approach, so feel free to shot 
them down if you disagree:

a) I understand y*30% is a simplified example.
However, most cloud apps are much more complex than the above example.
Hence, to obtain the entire chain of calculations may be a problem.
In addition, there is also the question whether the cloud app provider 
will expose their own algorithms to their customers.


b) Assuming the output of the calculations (in this case, the result of 
y*30%) is measured against some thresholds.
If the output exceeds the threshold, further actions may be triggered.

However, if x*30% is within the threshold, but y*30% exceeds the 
threshold, won't that result in false triggers or unnecessary further 
actions? And the reverse may also occur.

Imagine that the business mgt missed out critical business intelligence 
information becos y is used, instead of the real x?
Won't the reliability of cloud computing be questioned?

I have brought this up to in my discussion with you-know-who in MHA 
about this gap in cloud computing.
Using encryption makes sense only if you use the cloud to host emails 
and store files, but that is not cloud computing to me.
Existing services, such co-location, dedicated servers, managed 
services, can already address the needs of email hosting and file archival.
Cloud computing is about sharing the compute load, not just for storage 
or email purposes.

Also, it does not make sense to ask for dedicated machines from the 
cloud to avoid this encryption loophole, as the basis of cloud is about 
sharing of resources.
Dedicated machines from the cloud is no different from dedicated hosting.
As Shakespeare said, a rose smells as nice by any other name.
So dedicated machines from cloud is equal to dedicated hosting to me. ;-)

Just my 2-cent worth on this topic.
Pardon my non-mathematical view of the problem.
Me more realist lah. :-)

Thanks for the clarification, Andrew.

To clarify further, for Pt (b), I am referring to business process 
triggers, such as triggering inventory replenishment thresholds and etc, 
not actually IS triggers.
