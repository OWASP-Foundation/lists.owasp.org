*_Kaspersky Lab Asia -  Asia Pacific Cup Conference for Young
Professionals_*

*_Security for the Next Generation_*

Dear Sirs,

 

Kaspersky Lab Asia is seeking to find young talented students in
Singapore to be a part of their Asia Pacific Cup Conference. 

 

Kaspersky Lab is a leading developer of secure content and threat
management solutions who recognize the importance of providing a
platform for the next generation to share their knowledge and develop
new ideas to improve the level of security in information technology. 

 

We would like to invite your students to apply for a chance to be a part
of this dynamic new initiative.

 

To qualify for the Asia Cup Conference, students have to register and
submit a research paper of between 7,500 to 8,000 words on a set topic
on IT Security by 30^th November 2010.  The top 3 participants with the
best papers from Singapore will be awarded CASH of between US$500 to
US$1,000 and be invited to attend the Asia Pacific Conference to be held
at the University Technology of MARA (Malaysia) along with their peers
from across the region in 2011.

In addition, the top 3 entries will qualify to compete at Regional level
for more awards and prizes.  The top 3 papers from Asia Pacific will
then move on to the International level and win a chance to be showcased
at the International Conference.

 

The aim of the conference is to allow students to actively participate
in the development of science and interact with other talented young
security specialists from around the world.

This is a fantastic opportunity for students to gain valuable knowledge,
showcase and be recognized for their talent as well as make their own
contribution to the global scientific community.

Students who are chosen to participate will be given the chance to meet
industry experts, scientists and researchers in a collaborative
environment to present ideas and discuss issues relating to Cybercrime. 
This will be their chance to forge and maintain valuable professional
ties that may lead to exciting career opportunities.

 

Local students are set to benefit enormously from this experience.

 

We hope that you will encourage your students to seize this opportunity
to represent Singapore and showcase their talent to the world by either
forwarding the information to them or by telling them about this
initiative.

 

Below are the details of how to apply for the conference, if you have
any further enquiries or require additional information please do not
hesitate to contact me.

 

 

Kind regards

 

 

Lim Woan Ying
