<PRE>Hi folks,

I have managed to obtain 2 free delegate passes and 15% discount to
*Banking and Finance Technology Forum (BFTF) Asia 2011 Singapore* on 9
March 2011, organised by Euro-Events.

Only registered (aka with paid membership) OWASP SG members are eligible
to enjoy the above benefits

In addition, I have also obtained a speaking slot for any OWASP SG
member who is interested to speak in this event.
If you are interested, please send me your bio (including your job title
and photo), speaking topic and summary in 50 words by *24 Nov 2010 6pm*.
Final selection of the OWASP speaker is by BTFT organising committee,
not me. ;-)

Hope to hear from you soon.
And if you are not a OWASP member, you should really consider signing up
soon.
The freebies from Govware, this conference and others are worth more
than the US$50 membership fee.

-- 

Best Regards
Onn Chee
