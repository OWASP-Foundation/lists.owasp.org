Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Live streaming of security talks starting next
	Friday
Message-ID: <48989dd70808010406x6a670e10ie649f00d0c784f64@mail.gmail.com>

Starting from next Friday I will start a bi-weekly live (streaming)
presentation on various security topics. The topics and streaming
notice will be posted at
http://michaelboman.org/blog/category/live-broadcast/

The first presentation to be broadcasted will be "Privacy in Wireless
Networks", which I originally presented at the and Annual Wireless
Security Conference in Singapore. The date will be Friday the 8th
August at 20:00 CEST (GMT+0200).

The second presentation will broadcasted on Friday the 22nd August at
20:00 CEST (GMT+0200), and the topic will be "Overcoming USB
(In)Security" which I originally presented at the NextGen CyberCrime
Conference in Singapore.

I have some ideas what to present after these two pilot presentations,
but I would like to hear from you, my fellow security enthusiast. What
do you want to have explained to you? Look through my website
(http://michaelboman.org) and see if you find something that you would
like a demo of or explained live.

I hope that I will see you there, and if you can't attend due to other
commitments or time zone issues I will attempt to record the shows for
on-demand viewing.

Best regards
Michael Boman

Hi,

I'd like to anounce the "Best Practice Guide: Use of Web Application Firewalls"
now available in English at
   https://www.owasp.org/images/a/a6/Best_Practices_Guide_WAF_v104.en.pdf

This is the translation of the paper published in the German Chapter in March
   http://www.owasp.org/images/1/1b/Best_Practices_Guide_WAF.pdf

This paper is aimed at technical decission-makers, especially those responsible
for operations and security, as well as application owners evaluating the use of
a WAF. Special attention has been paid to the display of work estimates and in
comparsion to possible alternatives such as modifications of the source code.
Further key topics discussed include best practice for processing the 
installation
and operation of a WAF.

The paper was presented at the AppSec Europe 2008 in Gent by Alexander Meisel,
He will present it again at the AppSec 2008 Conference in NYC, see
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference

Feedback and discussion is wellcome at
   owasp-germany at lists.owasp.org or directly to the authors listed in the
document.

May be someone can link the paper at a proper page at owasp.org/

Cheers,
Achim

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Change of venue to Cairnhill CC for future
	meetings
Message-ID: <489A6F95.7040207@usa.net>

Hi everyone,

We have found a new home for our future meetings - Cairnhill CC!
And it is closer to Orchard Road. :-)

Many thanks to Frenky who has helped us to secure a permanent meeting 
place in Cairnhil CC, located at 1 Anthony Rd, 229944, Singapore.

Since the CC is providing a meeting venue for us free of charge, a 
condition is that all our meetup participants sign up for the CC 
membership (Passion Card). It will cost a person S$10 for a 3 year 
membership, so please bring along $10 on next Thursday.
If you are already a Passion Card holder, then you do not need to pay.

In addition, does any of you have a portable projector which the meetup 
group can borrow for the meeting?
If yes, do revert to me asap.
Thanks.

Regards
Onn Chee
