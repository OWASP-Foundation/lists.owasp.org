Hi Onn Chee,

I apologize in advance for the self advertisement but I thought you might be interested in the following:
http://honeynet.org/challenges/2010_2_browsers_under_attack as well as https://www.honeynet.org/node/523

It's a challenge the Singapore Team as well as the French one put together and although it was intended to students, i guess many can benefit from it.
There have been good solution proposed but maybe you can score better ;) 
Having singaporean response in an international wouldn't hurt. 

<snipped>

Cheers,

A poser to everyone out there.

What will you do when your vendor sends you this advisory?

I will like to conduct a poll of what your reactions will be.

Hi Rick,

Good advice.


Hi folks,

My $0.02 as follow:

1) Remember my push for dual browsers environment?
Having a primary option and a secondary option gives an organisation the
flexibility and choice.
Having a secondary choice also gives the organisation a stick to wave in
front of the primary vendor if the primary vendor ever acts against the
interest of the organisation.

Any organisation who has the freedom of choice is a very powerful, agile
and effective organisation.

2) In the event that it is not possible to have 2 vendors, one must be
prudent in selecting the sole primary vendor.
Many a times, organisations forget to add security requirements into
their procurement contracts.

I advise the following conditions to be added to all your procurement
contracts:

1) The selected enterprise vendor must update their solutions with *X*
weeks to support the new patches or upgrades of the supporting
applications after their official release dates.

2) These supporting applications include but not limited to:
a. OS patches
b. Application frameworks - .Net framework, Java Runtime/JDK, PHP framework
c. Richmedia plugins - Adobe Flash/Silverlight
d. Adobe Reader
e. Office suites - MS Office/OpenOffice
f. Browsers - IE/Firefox/Chrome

3) The vendor is liable for liquidated damages of Y% of the annual
maintenance amount for every working day of delay beyond the X weeks
deadline, in providing support of the new patches or upgrades in the
supporting applications.


If the vendor refuses to agree to the above conditions, do not sign with
them.
Choose a vendor who is willing to commit to upgrading their solutions to
ensure good security.

So now you have read this email, you no longer can use the defense of
ignorance!
You have now fallen in the trap of the knowledgeable. ;-)
Know your rights and exercise your rights!


Happy sharing and have a safe 2010!

Cheers
Onn Chee

Yes and No.

It really depends on the impact. If the impact is the critical products the
company is using is not working after an upgrade and affects the business,
then the answer is "no" to the upgrade. Else, why not since it is a patch
over the previous version of adobe reader.

Understand most of us are from the technical sides, where our answers for
upgrade to new version is a yes. But it is important to think on the
business impacts, because that is where your revenue comes from.

Hi Donald,

Thanks for your insight.

My point is not about the customers who use Fiserv.

Instead, my point is about what Fiserv is doing to their customers.

Of course, if I am using Fiserv products and they void any support for
Adobe Reader 9, then I won't be upgrading to Adobe Reader 9. Running
unsupported applications is also another risk.

The question we need to ask is how can customers ensure they do not get
penalised by the vendors' incompetency or insecurity.

I also work in a vendor organisation, but to be fair, I have to view
this from a customer's point of view.

So my poser is how you, as a customer, handle this advisory and even
prevent such risk from ever happening to you.

Cheers
Onn Chee

Just to follow up from my previous emails.

Since now _*ALL*_ of us know that this kind of risk can happen to us as
a customer of any vendor products, we, members of OWASP/SSMG, can no
longer claim ignorance about such risk.

After knowing this, how can we (assumed to be representing the customer
organisations) proactively protect ourselves and prevent such vendor
risks from occurring to us?

Just to pre-empt - the size of vendor is irrelevant in avoiding such
risk, so answers such as choose the biggest vendor does not hold water. ;-)

Hope to hear from all of you!

Cheers
Onn Chee
