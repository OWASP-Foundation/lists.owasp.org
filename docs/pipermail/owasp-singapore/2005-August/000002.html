<PRE>I am using a .NET application, in which there is a feature
to upload files (.doc .xls) onto the server. How do I ensure
that the end user is uploading only permitted file type(s) &amp;
not files containing any malicious code which can lead to
the compromise of the server? Please suggest security
measures that should be taken to avoid any such unwanted
upload.
 
 
 
Regards
 
Usman
