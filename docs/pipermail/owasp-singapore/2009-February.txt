Subject: [Owasp-singapore] PCI does not require end-to-end encryption
	within private networks??

Hi Onn Chee,

Good timing. I was at a customer's last week helping them prepare for PCI
compliance.

"PCI's dirty little secret is that it doesn't mandate encryption inside a
private network because
then all the processors would have to encrypt."

PCI-DSS only says in "Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data
across open, public networks: Sensitive information must be encrypted during
transmission over networks that are easy and common for a hacker to
intercept, modify, and divert data while in transit.

Irrespective of PCI and pre-PCI, normal best practice requirement is that
any sensitive information minimally goes over SSLv3/TLS, which covers
Requirement 4 above.

You have to keep in mind that PCI-DSS is relatively new and that it will
mature over time. Presently, some parts might seem too generous - and
auditors are possibly generous too - but that will change over time and
requirements and oversight will become stricter.

PCI-DSS is not theoretically perfect at this point in time and gets quite a
bit of criticism, but it's a great start especially in Asia where there are
very few compliance requirements.

So this statement by the Gartner analyst - "Billions is being spent on PCI
compliance, but it isn't really working" - is just flat out wrong. Why would
he say that? Who knows but the motivation is unimportant in this discussion.

Just like IT security, PCI-DSS compliance is an ongoing process. Handling
confidential customer data is a big responsibility, and as PCI-DSS becomes
more mature, the penalties for non-compliance will become stricter; and as
auditors gain more experience, it will take more effort to comply. That's
why it is important to convey to the client (read: management) that it is a
continuous effort to improve.

I've read about 20 articles on the Heartland payment processor breach, and
this is about the best one technically:
http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/articles.php?art_id=1175&opg=1

It looks like a sniffer was installed internally, but to effectively have
pulled off the heist, a lot of things had to go wrong; e.g. (1) if SSL was
being used, then SSLv1 or SSLv2 was used, or the key length was too short so
the encryption could be broken; (2) it had to be tricky to send out the data
collected; (3) a server had to be breached with admin privileges.

Heartland had achieved PCI compliance for more than one year but at least 2
of the 12 security controls were not in place. The biggest violation IMHO
was not regularly monitoring the log files which I have seen on EVERY PCI
prep project that I have done in the last year; Heartland stated that the
illicit data collecting had been going on for about 6 months and doing
regular monitoring would have probably greatly minimized the damage.

I discuss PCI preparation a little bit in my OWASP podcast, plus software
security in APAC and Web Application Firewalls:

Best regards,
Stephen

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] A poll on the popularity of use of duress
	passwords in applications
Message-ID: <498917DC.8060708@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Will like to know how many commercial applications that you have seen or
developed make use of duress passwords.

For your information, duress passwords are used during times of "duress"
(sorry for stating the obvious), so that limited access can still be
given but alerts/alarms will be sent out silently. This allows some
central body to be alerted and necessary remedial/rescue actions can be
taken.
Of course, the GUI of the application should not provide any indication
that a duress password was entered as the beauty of duress password lies
with its anonymity.

Duress password is especially useful when the authorised user is under
physical threat or coercion.
To protect the authorised user who is under threat, allowing the
authorised user to access the system with a restricted-access, duress
password is a much better option than forcing the criminal to physically
harm the authorised user who cannot give away the full access password.

The use of duress passwords is more commonly found in military uses, but
I will like to know the extend of such use in commercial applications.
And also the reasons why duress passwords are not used if otherwise.

Thank you for your attention.

Regards
Onn Chee

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Poor RSVP response to tomo's meet up
Message-ID: <498A6B77.5070204@usa.net>

Hi folks,

There are only 6 confirmed RSVP "Yes" members for tomo's meetup
(http://security.meetup.com/77/calendar/9475636/)

The speaker, Nicolas, is from France and here in Singapore just this week.
It is a rare opportunity to catch up with him, so I strongly encourage
all of you to attend.

If the RSVP "Yes" number is still less than 10 by this evening, I will
cancel this month's meetup then.
Because from past experience, the actual turnout rate is definitely less
than the RSVP numbers.

So do reply asap.
See you tomo!

Cheers
Onn Chee

Everyone,
Make sure you register online and you get to the OWASP Conference coming up
in the Gold Coast in two weeks.
The conference has an awesome set of speakers, topics and agenda for
application security, and as last year
this year is set to be even better.

There are numerous events for networking and meeting up with fellow
application security experts.
The cost of the conference is minimal and there is stil room available for
training attendees also.

Don't forget it's the 25-27th of February at the Gold Coast Convention
Centre. You can even stay over the weekend for a short break.
Cost of flights is cheap currently with Jetstar and Virgin Blue into the
Gold Coast, and there are deals online on the Conference page for cheap
accomodation.

If you have any questions regarding the conference, please feel free to
email me at
jderry at owasp.org

Regards
Justin
