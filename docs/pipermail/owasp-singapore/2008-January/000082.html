<PRE>We now have a new venue, as noted above, which is a nice Irish pub
called SODS, located on the left-hand side of Tras Street if you are
coming from the Tanjong Pagar MRT station.

As usual we don't have a set agenda, mainly because that would suggest
that there is some sort of hierarchy in the group - which there isn't
one. But here is some sort of structure how the night should turn out:

Around 7pm: People turn up at SODS, say &quot;Hi&quot; to each other and gets
their first drink (please note: if we get enough people attending I
think we can get a group discount, but I think the group needs to be
10 people or more - so bring a friend!).

I will table a discussion on how easy it is to acquire and misuse
someone's identity in Singapore (which was planned for the December
meetup, but was canceled last minute). I will also again bring my lock
pick set and some practice locks for those who are interested trying
it out and various other gadgets people might find interesting.

Then it's up to YOU: What will You bring to the table? A good story
perhaps? Please remember, this is not a formal fancy sort of event -
there is NO power point requirement or even prepared material. Your
view of things is very much appreciated as well. Don't have anything
of your own? Don't worry - bring a print-out of a interesting news
story you want to share and/or discuss. Mine will be this one:
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/01/dreamliner_security.">http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/01/dreamliner_security.</A>
Perhaps you are looking for tools for your security kit? Let us other
know, we might have already found the tool you are looking for.

When we have run out of topics to discuss we will adjourn the meetup -
which last time was 10-11pm (there was some difficulties to get a taxi
at the time).

If you haven't already done so, please RSVP for the event - even if
you are not coming. The link to the event is:

I hope to see you at the meetup tomorrow. If you get lost you can
always reach me at 96942601.

Best regards
 Michael Boman
