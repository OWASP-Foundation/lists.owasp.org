<PRE><A HREF="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/05/nsa_cyberwargames?currentPage=all">http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/05/nsa_cyberwargames?currentPage=all</A>

The 34 Army cadets comprising the West Point IT team operated in a 
different kind of battlefield, but their combat skills and instincts 
need to be every bit as sharp. Like George Washington said: &quot;There is 
nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet the 
enemy.&quot;

The SQL injections, targeting their Fedora Core 8 Web server, were a 
piece of cake for these IT combatants. Each injection tried to smuggle 
malicious code inside the seemingly harmless language used by the 
network&#8217;s MySQL software. The cadets handily defended with open source 
Apache web server modules, plus some manual tweaking of the SQL database 
to &quot;avoid any surprises,&quot; in the words of Lt Col. Joe Adams, a West 
Point instructor who helped coach the team.

But the kernel-level rootkit was much more dangerous. This stealthy 
operating-system hijacker can open unseen &quot;back doors&quot; into even highly 
protected networks. When they detected the rootkit's &quot;calls home&quot; the 
cadets launched Sysinternal's security software to find the hijacker, 
then they manually scoured the workstation to find the unwelcome 
executable file.

Then they terminated it. With extreme prejudice.
