Abstract

If your company&#8217;s website were hacked tomorrow, would you know what to do?

Forensics is not what you see on CSI, and most people have no idea what
they should do in the event of a compromise. What is an appropriate
incident response for a company, what do you say to your CEO and when do
you involve law enforcement? This presentation will demonstrate the
forensic process for a compromised website, and what an organization
should do when they find out they have been compromised. I will use case
studies from previous incidents I have investigated and demonstrate what
you should and shouldn&#8217;t do when you get pwned.

Speaker: Paul Craig

My name is Paul Craig and I work as the lead forensic incident responder
at Security-Assessment.com. I have seen first-hand hackers defacing,
defrauding and compromising small websites, large corporations and
government agencies. IT Forensics is here to pick up the pieces, and
it&#8217;s my job to spend long nights trying to provide answers to businesses
regarding what really happened.

Venue:

Cairnhill Community Club

Date/Time:

2 August 7pm.


Please RSVP at <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/SGSecurityMG/calendar/14187090/">http://www.meetup.com/SGSecurityMG/calendar/14187090/</A>
