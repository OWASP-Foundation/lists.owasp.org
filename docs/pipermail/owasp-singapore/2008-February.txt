A new report shows that while many attackers continue to stick with old 
techniques and targets, some are expanding their horizons in terms of 
tactics and victims

Norway seems to be a destination spot for conferences. On 9 April 2008 the
First International Workshop on security Testing will be held in
Lillehammer, Norway. Application security testing is within the scope of the
workshop. The call for papers can be found here:

Please pass the CFP onto your chapters or other interested parties.

Thanks.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Today's meetup is still on - hope to see you there

It seems that a lot of people are buying into the Valentine day
frenzy, but I see that at least some of you will be joining us
tonight. I want to discuss the latest news from EFF where two
interesting cases has come up:
- US Customs allegedly search through your computer for files and copy
stuff off it
- An suspect, allegedly had illegal material on his computer, is using
the 5th amendment to prevent law enforcement officers to force him to
reveal the password to the encrypted drive

And as we are talking about encryption, I'll show you how to use
TrueCrypt to provide plausible deniability to protect your data from
snooping.

I am also interested in Security Metrics, if anyone got any
information to share please do so.

Best regards
 Michael Boman
