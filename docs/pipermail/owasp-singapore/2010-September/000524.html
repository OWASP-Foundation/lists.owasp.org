Meetup Description

Web applications are more pervasive than ever and business owners are
always trying to out-do one another by improving functionality and
enabling greater business interaction with their customer base in order
to save money or find new sources of revenue. As they steam ahead, web
applications are oftentimes secured as an after thought rather than as
part of the development lifecycle. This is good news for consultants who
specialize in application vulnerability assessment services because
there is a continuous stream of work. But companies are realizing that
the consultancy approach does not scale and that scanning tools are
approaching the depth of what a consultant can do. Does continuous
improvement in scanning technology and SaaS offerings spell the end of
the consultancy approach? Can the tools possibly achieve the same depth
and cost-effectively scale across the enterprise? Are there hybrid
approaches that offer the best of both worlds? Attend this presentation
to discover the answers to these questions and more.

Speaker:
Claudio Scarabello, Global Product Manager
