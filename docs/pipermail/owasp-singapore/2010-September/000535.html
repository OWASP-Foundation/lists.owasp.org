<PRE>Hi,

Coming back to the original question of secure development. This is a very big 
problem that has been there for sometime as all here know.

Almost all of OWASP is dedicated to help in scenarios like these. I would like 
to share some things I have with you.

First and foremost let me talk about a project I truly believe in. This is 
called as the OWASP Enterprise Security API. I am currently handling the project 
development for the Objective-C platform. The aim of ESAPI is this:
ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web 
application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to 
write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it 
easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The 
ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development.
Allowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions have the 
same basic design:
	* There is a set of security control interfaces. They define for example types 
of parameters that are passed to types of security controls.
	* There is a reference implementation for each security control. The logic is 
not organization&#8208;specific and the logic is not application&#8208;specific. An example: 
string&#8208;based input validation.
	* There are optionally your own implementations for each security 
control. There may be application logic contained in these classes which may be 
developed by or for your organization. An example: enterprise authentication. 


You can find the link here 
.. <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API</A>

Currently ESAPI Java is the most updated version. The .Net and php versions are 
also out there and usable immediately. 

Objective-C is relatively new and still trying to catch up :) 

Any help that can be provided in development towards this project is 
appreciated. Feel free to contact me for any details necessary.

Best Regards,
Deepak Subramanian

Thanks, Daniel.

Should we then create an online catalog of insecure websites with findings 
contributed by the public and community?
Sort of a Stomp-like site but focus on insecure websites.

The only people to benefit from law suits are the lawyers. 
Trust me they do not need another source of income.

I would agree that awareness and education is key. For consumers and businesses 
its one of choice. That is when people if realise they are at 'risk' will take 
their business else where.

What needs to be demonstrate that good security= trust = $.

Regards
Daniel

Hi Claudio,

Good insight.

Should we update consumers that they have the right to sue a website
owner if the website is insecure and infects their visitors?
This way, the business folks will stop ignoring the value of appsec.
When their pockets are hurt, the business folks will move.

Perhaps we should run an awareness campaign to educate and inform
consumers about their rights.
I believe such a campaign benefits all infosec pros.
What do you think?


Regards
Onn Chee
