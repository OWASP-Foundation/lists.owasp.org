<PRE> Hi Claudio,

Good insight.

Should we update consumers that they have the right to sue a website
owner if the website is insecure and infects their visitors?
This way, the business folks will stop ignoring the value of appsec.
When their pockets are hurt, the business folks will move.

Perhaps we should run an awareness campaign to educate and inform
consumers about their rights.
I believe such a campaign benefits all infosec pros.
What do you think?


Regards
Onn Chee

</I>&gt;<i> Some interesting questions for us to think about:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - How were developers taught dodgy development practices?
</I>&gt;<i> - Is something broken in how we teach developers?
</I>&gt;<i> - If it is true that our developers are not taught in the right way,

</I>&gt;<i> instead of relying on OJT to learn about secure web app development?
