<PRE>Looks like someone else has replied. In any case, the reason why Opera
behaves so is summaries as follows:

This dialog will pop up if:


&#183;     SSL v2
&#183;     Encryption methods using 40 or 56 bit keys
&#183;     Key exchange performed using RSA or Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys less
than 900 bits long. (Keys less than 1020 bits long will reduce the security
level by one point).

RSA/DH keys shorter than 900 bits


These keys are used to protect the encryption keys for all transactions
with the server, if these keys are broken all communcition that has been
exchanged with the server from the time the key was created until it is
replaced sometime in the future is a wide open book. And that is not all:
Once these keys are broken an attacker can modify the information exchanged
between you and the server, and there is no way to detect such changes in
the protocol! The only way to find out is to check the information you have
with the information available at the server, and that checking must be
done in a different fashion since you cannot trust the protocol for such
audits.


Several years ago a 512 bit RSA key was broken in, effectively, 10-12 weeks
(they used 7-8 months computing by night on a few hundred workstations).
Today the same job could probably be done in less than 4 weeks, possibly
much less depending on how many computers you throw at it, and other
improvements in the art of factoring large numbers). Since such a key is
usually used for at least one year that means that keys of this length was
no longer adequate protection for any information that needed to be kept
secure for more than a few weeks.


With 8-cores desktops nowadays, script kiddies can probably do it within a
fortnight.

Thanks for the update, Ryan.

However, other browsers, such as FF and IE, seem to accept such short
key length as ok.

There seems to be no standard treatment of what is deemed as
insufficient and what is sufficient encryption between browsers.

Will like to hear the feedback from the group regarding this.

Regards
Onn Chee
