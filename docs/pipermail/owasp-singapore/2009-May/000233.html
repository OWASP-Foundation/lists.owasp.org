<PRE>Since the <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-singapore">Wireless at SG</A> was brought up, I might as well mention here that I
had encounter at least 2 Rouge AP running with the same SSID. One of them
is within City Hall and the other is in CBD area close to some banks.

The interesting part is that one of them does not have the standard login
at all. Free internet so to speak.

The other is more malicious in design. It has the exact same page copied
from the original site, including the login. I only spotted it because it
looks different on my specific device. The Rouge AP installer probably did
not expect me to use this device to browse to his AP. In his case, I did
not log in for obvious reasons.

So I urges everyone to be extra careful in using free wifi and assume at
all times free wifi cannot be trusted and you should not submit any
information what may compromise yourself over these networks.

Regards, Winston Leong

Hi Ray,

I will strongly recommend against using <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-singapore">Wireless at SG</A>, as anyone can
masquerade their rogue AP as <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-singapore">Wireless at SG.</A>

3G broadband is a much safer option.

Again, pardon my limited legal knowledge, but it may not be an offence
to masquerade <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-singapore">Wireless at SG</A> unless IDA or the providers complain.
Akin to our previous thread on the cyber-squatting of domain names.
