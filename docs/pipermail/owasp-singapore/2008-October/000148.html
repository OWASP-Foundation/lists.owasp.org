Just wanted to bring to the leaders attention that OWASP T10, OWASP
PHP Anti XSS library, OWASP pages on Canonicalization, Local, Unicode,
OWASP pages on Code Review for Logging issues and OWASP pages on Error
Handling and Logging have been referenced in the most recent SAFECode
guide for the most effective secure development best practices (*)

OWASP rule!

(*) The Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode)
today released &quot;Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development:
A Guide to the Most Effective Secure Development Practices in Use
Today.&quot; Based on an analysis of the individual software assurance
efforts of SAFECode members, the paper outlines a core set of secure
development practices that can be applied across diverse development
environments to improve software security.

&quot;SAFECode has brought together some of the most experienced software
assurance professionals in the industry to move us beyond theoretical
best practices to identify the secure development methods that have
proven to be both effective and implementable even when different
product requirements and development methodologies are considered,&quot;
said Paul Kurtz, executive director of SAFECode.  &quot;We have documented
and released these secure development practices in an effort to help
others in the industry initiate or improve their own software
assurance programs and encourage the industry-wide adoption of the
secure development methods outlined in this paper.&quot;
