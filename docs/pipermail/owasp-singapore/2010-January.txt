Hi All,

There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months.
Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in 
Microsoft
Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days that helps
malware hop from one machine to another with its payload which most of the
times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites like Twitter and
Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to carry targeted 
attacks.
Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010 Threat prediction:

http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_pred
ict_1209_v2.pdf

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all their
employees while using social networking portals which I think makes lot of
sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there something similar
happening at your organization as well?


Many Thanks,

Subhasis

Hi Subhasis,

Some companies I know just banned access to social networking sites from
their corporate network.
Of course, this does not stop chatterbox employees to access the sites
when they access from home.
So, blocking access from corporate network is a half-fence solution.

In addition, I am not sure about the legality of any social media policy
that extends into usage of such sites after office hours, as that sounds
like encroaching into the employees' personal time.

Just my $0.02. :-)

Regards
Onn Chee

For your reading.

So it is either Adobe Reader is at fault or IE is at fault.

Food for thought:
Now, is it time for dual readers and dual browsers?
Else, why will we stop this never-ending risk when we put all eggs in

MS admitted to the bug in IE which caused the attack on Google.

FYI, such incident can happen to other browsers too, though in different
forms.

So, any take on my good old recommendation of dual browsers? ;-)

Shouldn't they be asking their citizens to upgrade to IE8 instead?
Funny requests from the French and German govts though.....

Unlike in China where the majority is using pirated Windows and hence
upgrading to IE8 may not be an option.

OWASP Members and Supporters,

OWASP was founded, and is supported as a non-profit organization, by a
group of dedicated volunteers who believe that all applications should
be secure and trusted.  As our organization matures we have taken those
beliefs broader, and have started setting up ways for our members to
donate to the global community.  Among these initiatives are:

    * OWASP has an active Kiva lending team who have donated $9,125.00
      to date.  http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522
    * OWASP in response to the need in Haiti has set up a secure and
      trusted way for those within the OWASP community to donate funds
      to help the people of Haiti. This allows our OWASP community to
      help another with a single global voice.  100% of the collected
      donations will be transferred directly to victims for disaster
      relief such as food and medical requirements.  Please visit
      www.owasp.org <http://www.owasp.org> and click the link for
      G33k-4-HAITI.  In a time of crisis, OWASP can help those who are
      in great need. The OWASP community can help organize, support ,
      and promote efforts outside of application security.

OWASP is well aware there is a movement for phishers to utilize this
tragedy to get unsuspecting people to donate to a "cause" without having
a legitimate business back end and ultimately funneling all the money
directly into their own pockets.  The OWASP community is uniquely
qualified to help protect from this type of attack and educate about
attacks as well.

As the world becomes more dependent on technology and particularly web
applications, there are many who need protection who simply have no
options to protect themselves.  These include small companies,
individuals, charities, and others.  The OWASP community can help by
connecting qualified, trusted resources willing to volunteer their time
to those organizations which qualify. OWASP is setting up an outreach
program, which will be under the name project name of OWASP for Charities. 

We hope you will support OWASPs efforts to make a difference  in any of
the above ways. We are also open to suggestions in regards to where you
feel the OWASP Community can be of service.

Regards,

Your OWASP Board

The issue is not about being tied to one browser, i.e. IE (sorry for the
pun).

But why are organisations still using a _specific version_ of a browser,
namely IE6???
Has the operations/apps/security folks fell asleep at their work?
They should be performing _*mass upgrades to IE8 or switch to other
browsers*_ like yesterday!

How long more can we remain indifferent to this issue which is so
serious that MS is going to release an out-of-cycle fix?
Please help to spread the word to your colleagues, customers and vendors.
You will be helping the world in a small way. ;-)

Thanks for your prompt reply, Ben.

So are the organisations now sitting ducks becos of the version lock-in???
That they can't even upgrade to IE8?!

So how can we prevent such a colossal mistake from happening again?
It is ok if we get burned once, but we need to learn from this lesson.
So what pointers can we draw from this lesson so that we can share with
the rest?

As the saying goes, "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing
over and over and expecting different results"
So let's stop being insane and stop doing what we have been doing.

Hi All,

 

Just wondering. How do you justify a web application security programme when your public-facing web application is very few? 

 

Majority of web applications are non-public facing.

Hi Ruel,

I think I can write a 10 page paper to answer you :-)

Short answers:
- Probably between 30 & 40% of attacks are from insiders. If there is
not a reliable audit trail, then you won't catch him or her. And if a
company does catch him? In Singapore, there's a good chance that a
company will not prosecute in order to save face.

- If an employee has access to an "internal web application" but is
using it from home and possibly from a home computer (not a
company-issued laptop), then there are browser cross-domain issues
which essentially can make the internal web application an external
one and subject to the usual types of attacks (CSRF, XSS, etc).

- The web applications might be internal; the data that is consumed
and displayed by the apps are from a database. What are the sources
that are entering data into that database? From other web apps? From
PDAs in the field? From a 3rd party call center in India or the
Philippines? No matter... if your "internal" web apps are using
untrusted data, then it has to sanitize output or you could be
infecting your "internal" users.

I could go on and on but I hope you get my point.

Cheers,
Stephen

Realised the OWASP SG list was not included in the email comms, hence I
am forwarding this to all of you.

If you are already subscribed to security-77 at meetup.com, pardon me for
spamming you again.

Hi all,

As mentioned in my email, I can vouch for Ben that he means no malice.

I know Ben personally and he is a very friendly chap.
(After few rounds of beer, he will be even more friendly.)

So I welcome all of you to continue to share, discuss and learn from one
another.

Cheers
Onn Chee
Your humble organiser

My sympathies to MS for being blind-sided by the hackers.

As software folks, it is our greatest hope that bugs are always patched
before exploits are created, but we know that we do not live in the
Wonderland.

Happy reading,

Again, I marvel at the creativity of the "dark forces".
If only, the "good forces" can be equally creative in stopping them. ;-)
