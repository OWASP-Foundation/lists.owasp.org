<PRE>Hi folks,

Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) is holding their Fifth Counter eCrime
Operations Summit in KL from April 27-29.
For more details, you can refer to
<A HREF="http://www.apwg.org/events/2011_opSummit.html.">http://www.apwg.org/events/2011_opSummit.html.</A>

Here is a short description:

&quot;The fifth annual Counter-eCrime Operations Summit (CeCOS V) will engage
questions of operational challenges and the development of common
resources for the first responders and forensic professionals who
protect consumers and enterprises from the ecrime threat every day. This
year's meeting will focus on the development of response paradigms and
resources for counter-ecrime managers and forensic professionals.
Presenters will proffer case studies of national and regional economies
under attack, narratives of successful trans-national forensic
cooperation as well as models for cooperation and unified response
against ecrime and data resources for forensic activities.&quot;

As OWASP members, you are entitled to discounted member rates of US$225,
instead of US$300.

If you are interested, do drop me a note about the discount code as I
can only release the code to registered and paying OWASP members.


Sorry for sounding like a broken record...please BECOME A OWASP member!

Cheers!

Best Regards
Onn Chee
