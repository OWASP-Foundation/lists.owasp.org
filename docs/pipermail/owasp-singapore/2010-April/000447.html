<PRE>Well Onn Chee, I don't know what will you ask next but using GPF or General Purpose Fuzzer would do the job(cheap &amp; value-added) that is to find those bugs but since it doesn't &quot;talk&quot; to the debugger directly that is monitoring the target proves to be one of the disadvantages.

A good resource to refer to which I recommend would be &quot;Fuzzing: Brute Force Vulnerability Discovery&quot;.

Regards
Pishu

Just a show of hands - how many of you know and had performed fuzzing
before?
