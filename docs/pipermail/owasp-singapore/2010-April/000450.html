<PRE>Hi Onn Chee,

1) Yes I have used Fuzzers.
2) Depends on what I'm fuzzing. Is it a protocol or is it an application? There are 2 type of fuzzers or techniques. The first being generational and the other being mutational. I stick to GPF most of the time but I occasionally use PROTOS-SIP for fuzzing those VoIP devices and SPIKE Proxy for those pesky Web-Apps... ;)

Regards
Pishu

Thanks for the prompt reply, Pishu.

Just to clarify.
My questions are:

1) Have you used fuzzing?
2) If yes, what are your preferred fuzzers? Why?
