According to
http://mis-asia.com/news/articles/singapore-no.-2-black-hat-target-fortinet,
SG is the 2nd most popular target for black hat Web security attacks.

Not surprising given our recent awareness drive on the atrocious lack of
care in protecting confidentiality on web servers.

So better don't play play with web security.

You have been warned. ;-)

Message-ID: <4A556A69.9020105@usa.net>

Hi everyone,

OWASP SG has been invited to provide a judge for the SecureHello at SG
event, Singapore's first secure development competition.
This competition is supported by Association of IS Professionals (AISP),
Centre for Strategic IT (CSIT), International Association of Software
Architects (IASA), Nanyang Poly and OWASP.

You are required to be proficient in .NET and application security to be
able to evaluate the deliverables from the contestants.

The dates of the competition are 23^rd ? 25^th September 2009, to be
held in NYP.
I understand that the judges may be required only on 24 and 25 Sep 2009.

If you are interested, please drop me a note.

Thanks.

Regards
Onn Chee

Thanks, Aung.

This incident further gives merit to the good  practice to use multiple
browsers. :-)

That's why I find corporates, who standardise on only 1 browser, look a
bit naive in terms of web security.

Just like one should not only have firewalls from a single vendor, one
should not only use web browser from a single vendor too.

But well, good advice tends to fall on deaf ears.

And many in Singapore have deaf ears. ;-)
LOL.

Cheers
Onn Chee

In this meetup, the following items will be covered:

1) Step-by-step walkthrough of how the vulnerability was discovered.
- Learn how to be alert to spot future vulnerabilities. Be an extra pair
of eyes to keep Singapore secure.

2) Demonstration/illustration of potential exploits of the vulnerability
- Learn how the public may be affected by this vulnerability.

3) Analysis of the possible causes and suggested solutions
- Discuss how such vulnerability may arise and how one can prevent

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] What are the "best" solutions to protect against
	DDOS?
Message-ID: <4A5CA001.6030707@usa.net>

Given the recent media hype about the DDOS attacks against South Korea
and US, I will like to tap on the best brains in Singapore in a
discussion on the following areas:

1) How best to detect DDOS.

For e.g., is connection rate the best measure? How about measuring
latency of server responses and etc?


2) What are your favourite means to protect against DDOS?

For e.g. move to Akamai? Using Javascript injection/reply to validate
that it is a real browser, not a bot, which is sending the connection
requests? Move to cloud computing and etc?


3) How can the public, non-IT and non-IS trained, do to prevent their
Internet-connected terminals from becoming an unintentional DDOS attack
node?


If the outcome is of an acceptable quality, we will publish a summary of
our joint discussion to share with all our members.
At the same time, on behalf of OWASP/SSMG, I will send a copy to my good
friends in the policymaking bodies.
Hopefully, we can do our small bit to make digital Singapore a safer place.

Any folks interested to join in this initiative?

Regards
Onn Chee

Get the irony?

Looks like the MS security team does not talk to the marketing team to

For once, I salute the MS security folks for being so gung-ho. :-)
Hope no head in the security team was "chopped" by the marketing folks -
for doing the morally right thing, but with super lousy timing.

In future, we won't be sending such email correspondence to the group.
We will publish our success cases on http://www.infothatmatter.org once

To be fair, this vulnerability affected a particular plugin in IE, not the
browser itself.

All browsers has their own issues, you install one, you make sure you patch
that one more. I believe safe browsing is still the fundamental protection
that is required rather than a technical solution.

Just for the scoreboard, Firefox just got 0-dayed against with another
vulnerability.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] [security-77] Does the
 DirectDraw	vulnerability affect non-IE browser too?

Hi Winston,

Agree, we (at least for me) are not saying which browser is better than
the other.
Just as you said that FF (or Opera and Safari) has its own share of
vulnerabilities.
This topic is not about a browser war. :-)

Instead, I want to highlight that the usual practice of a single browser
in corporates is high risk and should be discouraged.
It is common sense that we do not put all our eggs in 1 basket.
And if we can do so for our security systems, such as F/W, why not apply
such good practice to the browser too?

I strongly advocate a dual browser environment for corporates, so that
organisations can enjoy the flexibility of switching browsers (can be
temporary) when any unpatched vulnerabilities in one of the browser are
found. To achieve this, all internal web applications must be
cross-browser compatible. Hence, the IS team must also work with the
apps team to achieve better protection from browser vulnerabilities.

Lastly, as a matter of curiosity, you mentioned that the recent IE is a
plugin problem.
So can we uninstall DirectDraw plugin from IE?
If yes, can you share with group?
Uninstallation, if possible, should be more effective than the MS method.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] [security-77] Does the
 DirectDraw	vulnerability affect non-IE browser too?
In-Reply-To: <4A5D4AC7.2060800@usa.net>
Message-ID: <OFFED8CFAB.DE9539DD-ON482575F4.00133248-482575F4.0014ED08@eyi.com>

Agreed Onn Chee. The intend was to provide a more vendor independent
approach to security. However, with the suggestion to installing multiple
browsers, I would like to present the other side of the story.

1. The more browser you install, the more vigilant you have to be in
patching. For example, instead of just IE, now you need to patch Firefox
regularly too. This is something that (unfortunately) administrator do not
like. I personally know of examples where organizations BANS Firefox simply
for this reason.

2. Installing more browser increases the exposure of being attacked.
Because browsers often comes with many components, it can often be
exploited as long as the component exist. This can also applies to the
number of plugins you install onto the browsers in order to increase the
functionality (as well as security risk).

3. Developers resists to multiple browser. They only wish to test their
software on 1 and make sure it work. The more browser there is to test, the
more work they need to do. Therefore more often than not, they simple put a
disclaimer to say it only works in browser X.

Being said the above, I installed more than 5 browsers myself though. The
reasons is more for testing and cross referencing the diff behavior (for
example to certain exploits).

As for the IE plugin, the affected DLL is msvidctl.dll. Microsoft's
solution via
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-032.mspx
addresses this by using the Killbit to disable the function. Remember to
reboot your system after installing the patch though.

And kinda of a good news for Vista and 2K8 users, the vulnerability takes a
lot more to work on these systems.

Hi Winston,

Agree, we (at least for me) are not saying which browser is better than the
other.
Just as you said that FF (or Opera and Safari) has its own share of
vulnerabilities.
This topic is not about a browser war. :-)

Instead, I want to highlight that the usual practice of a single browser in
corporates is high risk and should be discouraged.
It is common sense that we do not put all our eggs in 1 basket.
And if we can do so for our security systems, such as F/W, why not apply
such good practice to the browser too?

I strongly advocate a dual browser environment for corporates, so that
organisations can enjoy the flexibility of switching browsers (can be
temporary) when any unpatched vulnerabilities in one of the browser are
found. To achieve this, all internal web applications must be cross-browser
compatible. Hence, the IS team must also work with the apps team to achieve
better protection from browser vulnerabilities.

Lastly, as a matter of curiosity, you mentioned that the recent IE is a
plugin problem.
So can we uninstall DirectDraw plugin from IE?
If yes, can you share with group?
Uninstallation, if possible, should be more effective than the MS method.

      To be fair, this vulnerability affected a particular plugin in IE,
      not the
      browser itself.

      All browsers has their own issues, you install one, you make sure you
      patch
      that one more. I believe safe browsing is still the fundamental
      protection
      that is required rather than a technical solution.

      Just for the scoreboard, Firefox just got 0-dayed against with
      another
      vulnerability.

            Thanks, Aung.

            This incident further gives merit to the good? practice to use
            multiple
            browsers. :-)

            That's why I find corporates, who standardise on only 1
            browser, look a

      bit

            naive in terms of web security.

            Just like one should not only have firewalls from a single
            vendor, one
            should not only use web browser from a single vendor too.

            But well, good advice tends to fall on deaf ears.

            And many in Singapore have deaf ears. ;-)

It is 1 Aug 1235am and UOB web site is still not accessible......

Funny thing is that its TCP Port 80 is still accessible, so the web
service is still up and connectable.
That rules out Layer 4 DOS attacks.

Don't tell me my greatest fear has happened....that my good friend's,
RSnake's, slow..... tool is being used by hackers to DOS UOB Apache web
server.

Anyone who knows someone in UOB IS?

Seems like UOB may have won the infamous title of being the first
Singapore flagship organisation to suffer since the Korea and US DOS
attacks.

Man...IDA must start raising the importance of web security awareness in SG.
Too many ostriches here when it comes to web security. *sign*

Hi Jackson,

Now, including you, there are 3 independent verifications excluding me.

Let's see whether this still persists when the sun rises again on Sat
morning.

If yes, we may even get to hear about this in the Saturday evening news.

Again, ostrich symptom in play here as it was not that long ago when the
US and Korea sites were DDOS.

Thanks, Rick.
You now make the Fantastic 4.

Folks, let's call it a day and see whether this still persists in the
morning.

We should not be staying awake and forsaking our sleep for someone
else's security oversight.

Sweet dreams and hope you don't have DOS nightmares. ;-)
