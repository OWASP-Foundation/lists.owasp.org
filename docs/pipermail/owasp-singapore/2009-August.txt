It seems that nothing we can do. Firefox is an popular web browser after all, much more bug free than IE.

The BIG news this week was all about poor McAfee?s spreadsheet spillage
that resulted in the personal details]] of some 1400 security conference
attendees being e-mailed to some (if not all, but McAfee denies this) of
the delegates in a thank you message.


Hmm...this rings a bell in our recent NUS screw-up.

Funny this is that this happens to McAfee which has an excellent DLP
product.

A case of not walking the talk???

Well, one can use IE if you want to surf anonymously.

Or use Firefox when you want to access ActiveX pages.

Back to my 2 browser recommendation. :-)

I mean generally people use firefox and the community trust google to keep the privacy data. Guess we can trust Google for this.

Hmmm....should I start to withdraw my monies from UOB now? ;-)

Anyone knows who is the head of IS in UOB?

Maybe we can invite him to talk in one of our meetup. :-)

Sorry, folks.

I may have jumped the gun.

It seems to be DDOS again as at 1233pm. *sign*

As at 106pm, it seems to be down again.

Anyway, let's stop monitoring since we have better things to do. :-)

The up & down of their web site seems intermittent though port 80 is
always accessible.

My bet is they are under slowloris attacks which can evade normal TCP
DDOS controls.

Lol. But I do agree people do play a part in protecting the password other than just pure security.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Adobe confirms Flash contains Microsoft dev code
 bug, Promises fix for Flash on Thursday; only IE users at risk
Message-ID: <4A77E31B.9000809@usa.net>

http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/312949/adobe_confirms_flash_contains_microsoft_dev_code_bug?eid=-144

Until a patch for Flash is available, Adobe urged customers to
"consider" installing Microsoft's MS09-034 update, which that company
delivered Tuesday via Windows Update. Included in that IE update are new
defensive measures that are supposed to detect and block ActiveX
controls, like Flash Player and Shockwave Player, that were created
using the buggy ATL


Onn Chee: If you apply the latest MS patch, you are not likely to use
Adobe Flash in IE until after this Thu.

Hi Security Gurus,

Our company has this problem of sending invoice (and other files) via email unencrypted. The files are coming from our core systems such as SAP, then sent through a relay and then to the recipient. In this scenario, we are unable to encrypt the email.

One option we are thinking is using gateway mail encryption. But is there any other better solution than this? Appreciate your advise/feedback. Thanks!

Ruel

Ruel,

You and your recipient could implement SMTP server that support TLS (i.e.
SSL) but this won't encrypt the e-mail once it has been delivered (i.e. "at
rest").

For "data at rest", I would recommend GPG i.e. http://www.gnupg.org/

Message-ID: <4A839535.7080303@usa.net>

http://www.cso.com.au/article/314519/study_adobe_flash_cookies_pose_vexing_privacy_questions?eid=-302

Many Web sites do not disclose their use of Flash in their privacy
policies, they wrote. "Since users do not know about Flash cookies, it
stands to reason that users lack knowledge to properly manage them," the
paper said.

Flash cookies can hang around longer, too. They have no expiration date
by default, they're stored in a different location than HTTP cookies and
can contain up to 100KB of information, whereas HTTP cookies can only
have 4KB.

"These differences make Flash cookies a more resilient technology for
tracking than HTTP cookies and creates an area of uncertainty for user
privacy control," the researchers wrote.

Online advertising companies, however, have embraced Flash cookies since
many people regularly delete HTTP cookies. Since those cookies are used
to detect repeat visitors to Web site, they're important to getting
accurate traffic counts. False traffic counts -- or the counting of
repeat visitors as unique visitors -- results in advertisers overpaying.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Follow-up from yesterday's meetup
Message-ID: <4A85420E.9090404@usa.net>

For those of you who were there in yesterday's meetup,

Besides the SG govt leak, I also shared how I spotted one of our local
transport companies did not do a clean job in securing their web site
information becos they expose the WAF/Firewall that they are using.

Here is the HTTP response for your reference:

HTTP/1.x 200 OK
Date: Fri, 14 Aug 2009 10:38:03 GMT
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
X-AspNet-Version: 1.1.4322
Cache-Control: private
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Server: Concealed by Juniper Networks DX
Content-Encoding: deflate
Warning: 214  "Juniper Networks DX Active"
Vary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Via: 1.1 dx2 (Juniper Networks Application Acceleration Platform - DX
5.2.6 0)
Set-Cookie: rl-sticky-key=c0a8089b; path=/;

Yes, they have done something good by adding a Juniper WAF in front of
their web server, but is there really a need to tell the entire world
you are using Juniper Networks Application Acceleration Platform - DX
5.2.6 0?
And that you are running ASP.Net version 1.1.4322 too?
Why changed the Server to "Concealed" at all when everything else is leaked?

*Lesson*: If you want to conceal, please conceal fully. Don't conceal
one thing and reveal another thing. IS pros should not be playing
peekaboo games....we don't work in Geylang.

Again, ostrich symptom in play here - thinking that there is nothing
more to be done after slapping a Juniper in front of your web server.

Maybe we can run the first SG OWASP conference and call it "Ostrich
Conference"?
Any seconders? ;-)

Aung Khant,

Thanks for your insight.
Acknowledge that all vendors want to advertise their products.
We do live in the real world. :-)

However, in this case Juniper can still advertise their product in the
following way, without disclosing too much info

HTTP/1.x 200 OK
Date: Fri, 14 Aug 2009 10:38:03 GMT
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET <http://ASP.NET>
X-AspNet-Version: 1.1.4322
Cache-Control: private
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Server: Concealed by Juniper Networks DX
Content-Encoding: deflate
Warning: 214  "Juniper Networks DX Active"
Vary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Via: 1.1 dx2 (Juniper Networks Application Acceleration Platform - DX
5.2.6 0)
Set-Cookie: rl-sticky-key=c0a8089b; path=/;

It is one matter when advertising that "hey, there is a Juniper here",
but it is another matter when disclosing too much info, such as build
version.

It appears that this is a load balancer (a outdated one anyway). I believe
these are the default and more often than not, appliance company like to
show off their appliances by using these banners and headers.

These can be disabled with the following instructions (via
http://kb.juniper.net/index?page=content&id=KB12832&cat=DX_SERIES&actp=LIST) :

You can disable the DX setting the Via and/or?Warning? HTTP headers
respectively with:?


  set server factory h v disabled


? set server factory h w disabled


these are global settings, you can adjust these per cluster too with:


? set cluster <cluster name> factory h v disabled


? set cluster <cluster name> factory h?w disabled


The DX adds these as it is acting as a?reverse proxy; these headers?notify
clients? they don't talk directly to?the server but through a proxy as per
the HTTP?RFC.


After disabling these you can use apprules to insert your own Via and/or
warning header as required e.g.


PTH: url starts_with "/" then insert_reply_header "Via" "The long way"


You can use apprules to modify headers set by the target server, from your
output it looks like you are using nitro.apprule or a modified version of
it.?? You can view this default file with 'show file nitro.apprule', within
are statements that hide the Server header e.g.


#PTH20
PTH: reply_header "Content-Type" contains "plain"
??? and reply_header "Cache-Control" not_contains "no"
??? and reply_header "Cache-Control" not_contains "private"
??? and reply_header "Cache-Control" not_contains "max-age"
??? and reply_header "Pragma" not_contains "no-cache"
??? and reply_header "Expires" not_exists
??? and http_reply_code equals "200"
??? and query_string not_exists
??? then insert_reply_header "Cache-Control" "max-age=600"
??? and update_reply_header "Server" "Concealed by Juniper Networks DX"
??? and cache "600"


You can either modify your applied apprule to?set the Server header as you
wish (or preserve it by deleting the relevant line).

For those of you who were there in yesterday's meetup,

Besides the SG govt leak, I also shared how I spotted one of our local
transport companies did not do a clean job in securing their web site
information becos they expose the WAF/Firewall that they are using.

Here is the HTTP response for your reference:

HTTP/1.x 200 OK
Date: Fri, 14 Aug 2009 10:38:03 GMT
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
X-AspNet-Version: 1.1.4322
Cache-Control: private
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Server: Concealed by Juniper Networks DX
Content-Encoding: deflate
Warning: 214  "Juniper Networks DX Active"
Vary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Via: 1.1 dx2 (Juniper Networks Application Acceleration Platform - DX 5.2.6
0)
Set-Cookie: rl-sticky-key=c0a8089b; path=/;

Yes, they have done something good by adding a Juniper WAF in front of
their web server, but is there really a need to tell the entire world you
are using Juniper Networks Application Acceleration Platform - DX 5.2.6 0?
And that you are running ASP.Net version 1.1.4322 too?
Why changed the Server to "Concealed" at all when everything else is
leaked?

Lesson: If you want to conceal, please conceal fully. Don't conceal one
thing and reveal another thing. IS pros should not be playing peekaboo
games....we don't work in Geylang.

Again, ostrich symptom in play here - thinking that there is nothing more
to be done after slapping a Juniper in front of your web server.

Maybe we can run the first SG OWASP conference and call it "Ostrich
Conference"?
Any seconders? ;-)

Thanks for the detailed instructions, Winston.

But the oversight is by one of our local transport companies.

So if you do know some contacts in there, I can follow up with you on
the actual identity so that they can rectify this oversight before we
disclose their identity.

Hi Security Gurus,

Here I am again asking for some advise. And Im sure this is not the last, so I hope you dont get fed up with me. ;-p

Do you know of any simplest way to score application vulnerability (or threat rating system, or whatever you call them)? 

Basically, I am doing a security assessment of an in-house application (not web-based). I have discovered a few vulnerabilities. But now, I want to rank the vulnerabilities so that we can prioritize which one needs to be fixed first.

Thanks a lot!

Regards,
Ruel

Ruel,

Have you considered the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)?  It is
published at http://www.first.org/cvss/

CVSS is one of the simple answer, but also one of the hardest to implement
because to use this effectively, you need to understand the impact
(business sometimes).

If you had used a tool to find the vulnerability, usually there is a High,
Medium, Low etc associated with the risk.

In any case, the general formula of "Impact x Probability" always works.

That is one thing extreme about Google Safebrowsing.

When one or several of your sub-pages are infected with malicious codes,
they blacklist the whole domain.

Let this be a warning to all those do not bother about their websites.

Again, on this topic.
This case is similar to the one suffered by websites of UniSIM, Fiat SG
and Popular Bookstore.

I will like to seek feedback from the group on how you will address such
a scenario:

That the web server is infected with malicious Javascript which does not
affect the infected web server, but affects all visitors to the site by
tricking them to download and install malware which is hosted elsewhere.

Let's assume the following:

1) Server-side AV software is useless here as the malware is not on the
affected web server.
2) Client-side AV software is not effective if the malware could be a
zero-day exploit.
(The successful infection of UniSIM students in Jan this year shows that
client-side AV is not foolproof.)

There are tons of ways for the malicious Javascript to get into the
affected web server.
Feel free to propose the possible causes and the relevant counter-measures.

Let's get creative! :-)

	Taiwan wafer-fab giant
Message-ID: <4A94962D.4080105@usa.net>

Seems like the job market is picking up.... 
Good news for all of us. :-)

1. Lead projects of critical information protection, high security design,
security operation center set-up, network/ computer forensics, identity and
access management, SOA security, Web security,  and the other related IT
security tasks.
2. As an architect, design high availability and disaster recovery of IT
system, majority in the application level high availability design.

Hi Aung,

Good feedback.

A further question on the effectiveness of server-side AV.

With reference to Knowsec's, a well-known Chinese company, database of
infected Chinese sites, can server-side AV block those listed at
http://www.scanw.com/blog/archives/date/2009/08 ?

Examples of malicious links:

a) <script src=http://click.cwebgame.com/api.js></script>

b) <script type=?text/javascript? language=?JavaScript?
src=?http://0810%2E6600%2Eorg? id=?seraph3script6243?  ></script>

c) <script language=?JavaScript? type=?text/javascript?
src=?http://c0812.2288.%6Frg? id=?seraph4script6785?  ></script>

d) http://bbs.gamespot.com.cn/include/js/common.js


I am very curious as to how server-side AV can block these effectively
without generating too many false positives.

Winston,

The residual risk to the business is calculated with the Environmental Base
Metrics of CVSS.

The High, Medium, Low, etc value does not represent the residual risk,
rather the "severity" or "damage consequence" of the residual risk, which
co-incidentally are calculated by the Base and Temporal Metrics of CVSS.

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Anyone see this Google blacklist of Fraser
 Centrepoint Trust too at around 4pm 27 Aug 2009?
Message-ID: <4A964DFA.4010901@usa.net>

Please refer to the attached screenshot.

Are Singapore websites now being targeted to distribute malware hosted
in other countries?
(If you can recall, victims of such attacks mostly do not end up hosting
the malware themselves.
They only acts as "tour guides" to trick visitors to download and
install malware hosted elsewhere)

It feels eerie that such a large organisation, Frasers, is also hit by
such attacks just when we are having a good online discussion on this topic.

Good thing is that the Fraser Centrepoint Trust web server is currently
unblocked by Google Safebrowsing as of 5pm 27 Aug 2009.

As a IS group, what do you think we should do to address this budding trend?

Regards
Onn Chee

"The mass SQL injection

attention
<http://www.scmagazineus.com/New-mass-SQL-injection-attack-infects-56000-websites/article/147178/>
earlier this week are continuing, with some 210,000 pages infected so far.

All of the attacks are coming from IP addresses based in China, "



"The attack works in two stages. The first is to *infect the target web
pages*, and then *when visitors browse to the infected pages, malware is
downloaded to their machines*."

Onn Chee: Again the malware is usually not hosted on the target web servers.

Hi everyone,

Sorry on my previous incomplete email.

One of my friend working in another company, saw his network admin hack into
1 of the ex employee yahoo email account successfully. It was fast, and it
was in minutes. The interesting fact is the network admin joined the company
1 week after the ex employee left.

My bet was the ex employee left sensitive info of his email account, logged
in the network. That could be the reason why the network admin able to log
into his yahoo so quickly. Don't think is yahoo email account insecure.

Any other ways u guys can think off?

Regards,
Donald

The following could had happened:

1. The user did not login using SSL, which makes all username and password
non-encrypted.
2. The administrator simple hijacked the session to obtain a valid login.
3. The user simply pasted his password on some post-it which can be seen.

	employee Yahoo email mailbox
Message-ID: <282503.22830.qm@web43140.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

First time replying here. Just my 2 cents, I think he specifically mentioned that the Admin joined the company after the victim left the company.

If that is the case, then the Admin wouldn't have been able to hijack any session. Please correct me if I am wrong.

If there is no physical means to obtain the information (post-it notes for example =) ), then could it be possible that the company keeps a history of all information passing the gateway? I know my company keep tracks of the websites that the employee's visit. However, I do not know if they keep a log of additional information passed.

Also, considering that the victim 'left' the company, usually the Admin would be required to 'cleanup' the workstation that the victim was using. The Admin could have tapped into the PC itself to retrieve the 'remembered' passwords. The possibility is endless.

I am not a professional when it comes to security, just my 2 cents and someone please correct me if I am thinking in the wrong direction.

Thank you.

Regards,
Fong Kai

??? The following could had happened:

??? 1. The user did not login using SSL, which makes all username and password
??? non-encrypted.
??? 2. The administrator simple hijacked the session to obtain a valid login.
??? 3. The user simply pasted his password on some post-it which can be seen.

"The possibility is endless." I can't agree more.

Just to add on,
In this situation, if I am put into the position to get the account ASAP, I
would use social engineering to archive it. One simple way is to "convince"
the (robot) administrator that you need to recover your password.

I am not sure if I should post this, but I guess it probably no longer
works anyway. One of the way to "craft" the email to the robot admin so
that it nicely gives you the (resetted) password of the target account. It
(used) to work on many mail server. Well, another common use of this
tactics also created a lot of "cases" for my friends in the SPF due to
hijacking of accounts in popular MMORPG.

     The following could had happened:                                      
                                                                            
     1. The user did not login using SSL, which makes all username and      
 password                                                                   
     non-encrypted.                                                         
     2. The administrator simple hijacked the session to obtain a valid     
 login.                                                                     
     3. The user simply pasted his password on some post-it which can be    
 seen.

Hi Guys,

A novice-question again. 

What are the ways to exploit internal web application? I know web applications which are external facing can be exploited by XSS, SQL injection etc. But if attackers cant even see the web application because its only available internally, then how can they be exploited?

Basically, I am trying to justify the need to review our web application development practices. Thanks!

Regards,
Ruel
