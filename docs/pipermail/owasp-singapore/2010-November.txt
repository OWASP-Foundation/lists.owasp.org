Hi folks,

If there is no response to the Call for Content by 15 Nov, I will assume
the group is not interested to support the educational repository.

Thanks, Ray!

You can start sending me the links to resource you found to be helpful
to developers.

Reminder: Do not send the links to the mailing list to avoid spamming
every one.

"Antivirus vendor Symantec said that it had first seen exploits aimed at
the IE bug several days ago when it came across spam that had been sent
to select individuals within some organizations. The messages posed as
hotel reservation notifications.

"Within the e-mail, the perpetrators added a link to a specific page
hosted on an otherwise legitimate site," said Symantec researcher Vikram
Thakur in an entry on his company's blog
<http://www.symantec.com/connect/pt-br/blogs/new-ie-0-day-used-targeted-attacks>
. "The hackers had gotten access to the Web site account and uploaded

True.

I have seen bank customers who are rolling out new internal banking
systems which requires IE6.
The FSI industry is sitting on a time-bomb which will implode sooner
than later.
Will love to tell the FSI folks then - "I told you so". ;-)

Maybe MAS should issue a directive that use of IE 6 or any obsolete
browsers is not allowed.
This is no different than the typical audit requirement that "thou
should not run unsupported systems".
So why are auditors allowing FSI to continue running unsupported browsers?
Maybe we should audit the auditors? ;-P

Sorry for the grumbling and thank you for your time in listening. :-)

*_Kaspersky Lab Asia -  Asia Pacific Cup Conference for Young
Professionals_*

*_Security for the Next Generation_*

Dear Sirs,

 

Kaspersky Lab Asia is seeking to find young talented students in
Singapore to be a part of their Asia Pacific Cup Conference. 

 

Kaspersky Lab is a leading developer of secure content and threat
management solutions who recognize the importance of providing a
platform for the next generation to share their knowledge and develop
new ideas to improve the level of security in information technology. 

 

We would like to invite your students to apply for a chance to be a part
of this dynamic new initiative.

 

To qualify for the Asia Cup Conference, students have to register and
submit a research paper of between 7,500 to 8,000 words on a set topic
on IT Security by 30^th November 2010.  The top 3 participants with the
best papers from Singapore will be awarded CASH of between US$500 to
US$1,000 and be invited to attend the Asia Pacific Conference to be held
at the University Technology of MARA (Malaysia) along with their peers
from across the region in 2011.

In addition, the top 3 entries will qualify to compete at Regional level
for more awards and prizes.  The top 3 papers from Asia Pacific will
then move on to the International level and win a chance to be showcased
at the International Conference.

 

The aim of the conference is to allow students to actively participate
in the development of science and interact with other talented young
security specialists from around the world.

This is a fantastic opportunity for students to gain valuable knowledge,
showcase and be recognized for their talent as well as make their own
contribution to the global scientific community.

Students who are chosen to participate will be given the chance to meet
industry experts, scientists and researchers in a collaborative
environment to present ideas and discuss issues relating to Cybercrime. 
This will be their chance to forge and maintain valuable professional
ties that may lead to exciting career opportunities.

 

Local students are set to benefit enormously from this experience.

 

We hope that you will encourage your students to seize this opportunity
to represent Singapore and showcase their talent to the world by either
forwarding the information to them or by telling them about this
initiative.

 

Below are the details of how to apply for the conference, if you have
any further enquiries or require additional information please do not
hesitate to contact me.

 

 

Kind regards

Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Insecurity of AXA SG websites
Message-ID: <4CE1443B.2020407@usa.net>

Hi folks,

Just want to share with all of you something I found on 27 Oct (which I
had responsibly disclosed to the right parties on 27 Oct).

When I was surfing AXA websites for their insurance products on 27 Oct,
the following incidents were discovered:

*1) www.axalife.com.sg was deemed malicious*
Refer to "AXA Reported Attack Page.png" and "Google Safe Browsing
diagnostic page for axalife.com.sg.png"
Google Safebrowsing has blacklisted www.axalife.com.sg as a suspected
malicious site which may harm visitors' machines.
I have attached the diagnostic page for your reference.

Another attached file, StopBadware - axalife.com.sg.png, shows that the
www.axalife.com.sg was actually infected since 20 Oct!!

Is there any one you know whose system was compromised when they visited
www.axalife.com.sg between 20 Oct to 28 Oct?

I assuming none of you will be compromised since all of you are gurus. ;-)

*2) Unpatched www.axa.com.sg website*
Refer to "AXA Information Leakage.png" and "AXA Information Leakage - 2.png"

Obsolete URLS on AXA website, www.axa.com.sg, result in disclosure of
sensitive platform information.

>From these screen captures, any hacker can see that AXA is running on a
IIS server with "Microsoft .NET Framework Version:2.0.50727.4927;
ASP.NET Version:2.0.50727.4927"

According to this Wikipedia page,
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_.NET_Framework_versions,
it seems like the www.axa.com.sg has not been patched since 22 Oct 2009.



So if you are a AXA customer, please exercise due care and diligence
when using their online portal

Message-ID: <4CE3E8A3.3090904@usa.net>

Hi folks,

I have managed to obtain 2 free delegate passes and 15% discount to
*Banking and Finance Technology Forum (BFTF) Asia 2011 Singapore* on 9
March 2011, organised by Euro-Events.

Only registered (aka with paid membership) OWASP SG members are eligible
to enjoy the above benefits

In addition, I have also obtained a speaking slot for any OWASP SG
member who is interested to speak in this event.
If you are interested, please send me your bio (including your job title
and photo), speaking topic and summary in 50 words by *24 Nov 2010 6pm*.
Final selection of the OWASP speaker is by BTFT organising committee,
not me. ;-)

Hope to hear from you soon.
And if you are not a OWASP member, you should really consider signing up
soon.
The freebies from Govware, this conference and others are worth more
than the US$50 membership fee.

Onn Chee

If only we had such law in SG, we could more easily convince mgt about

For one, I hope that we will see less insecure websites - private and

Yup, I agree with you. But to punish is very subjective. Some companies can
just argue through the security audits of why certain requirements cannot
put in place due to business concerns and needs.

What the minimum can done is to keep sensitive customer information
encrypted during transfer, yet the transfer might not be a secure channels
due to hidden code logic implementation. In conclusion, it's difficult to
judge and see the detail pictures sometimes.
