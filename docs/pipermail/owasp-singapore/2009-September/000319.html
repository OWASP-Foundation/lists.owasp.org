<PRE>
Using the same password is a HIGH possibility. Ask around, I am sure most
of us is guilty to some extend.
However, I want to point out that what the admin is doing is probably in
some grey area or already considered illegal. The company has every right
to investigate the corporate email etc, but hacking into the employee's
personal email would probably be very hard to justify, especially if it is
done without the knowledge of the ex-employee.

Hi Fong Kai,

Yes, you are right. The network admin joined the company 1 week later after
the employee left the company. It would be quite impossible to hijack the
user session since they don't even met before. My friend told me the
network admin was tasked to carry out an investigation on the ex-exmployee
on any unauthorized email sent to his personal email.

Could it be possible that the network admin the employee windows domain
password, and then found the domain password works for his yahoo email
account? I believe most of the people would use the same password for most
of his email accounts.

Hi all,

Yup, I also agree the possibility is endless. It is scary for the company
to be able to hack into the employee personal email because he/she has
accessed it before in the company network. Does the company network logged
such sensitive information in the network traffics? Any network admin can
comments on this? Is it even possible to find the user email and password
even if it is SSL encrypted using the network log?

Recently, I found a youtube clip on hacking into someone's yahoo email
account using the profile view method via yahoo messenger. I wonder if this
clip something that is real or a fake. Anyone came by this clip before? Is
it real?

It seems to be becoming very real that accessing personal email via the
company network is a dangerous and insecure even if the site is SSL
encrypted. One would never know if someone is watching on his network
access without his/her knowledge.


Regards,
Donald

  Just to add on,
  In this situation, if I am put into the position to get the account ASAP,
  I
  would use social engineering to archive it. One simple way is to
  &quot;convince&quot;
  the (robot) administrator that you need to recover your password.

  I am not sure if I should post this, but I guess it probably no longer
  works anyway. One of the way to &quot;craft&quot; the email to the robot admin so
  that it nicely gives you the (resetted) password of the target account.
  It
  (used) to work on many mail server. Well, another common use of this
  tactics also created a lot of &quot;cases&quot; for my friends in the SPF due to
  hijacking of accounts in popular MMORPG.

  &#160;Hi,

  &#160;First time replying here. Just my 2 cents, I think he specifically
  &#160;mentioned that the Admin joined the company after the victim left the
  &#160;company.

  &#160;If that is the case, then the Admin wouldn't have been able to hijack
  any
  &#160;session. Please correct me if I am wrong.

  &#160;If there is no physical means to obtain the information (post-it notes
  for
  &#160;example =) ), then could it be possible that the company keeps a history
  &#160;of all information passing the gateway? I know my company keep tracks of
  &#160;the websites that the employee's visit. However, I do not know if they
  &#160;keep a log of additional information passed.

  &#160;Also, considering that the victim 'left' the company, usually the Admin
  &#160;would be required to 'cleanup' the workstation that the victim was
  using.
  &#160;The Admin could have tapped into the PC itself to retrieve the
  &#160;'remembered' passwords. The possibility is endless.

  &#160;I am not a professional when it comes to security, just my 2 cents and
  &#160;someone please correct me if I am thinking in the wrong direction.

  &#160;Thank you.

  &#160;Regards,
  &#160;Fong Kai

  &#160; &#160; The following could had happened:

  &#160; &#160; 1. The user did not login using SSL, which makes all username and
  &#160;password
  &#160; &#160; non-encrypted.
  &#160; &#160; 2. The administrator simple hijacked the session to obtain a valid
  &#160;login.
  &#160; &#160; 3. The user simply pasted his password on some post-it which can be
  &#160;seen.
