<PRE>The following could had happened:

1. The user did not login using SSL, which makes all username and password
non-encrypted.
2. The administrator simple hijacked the session to obtain a valid login.
3. The user simply pasted his password on some post-it which can be seen.

Hi everyone,


My friend working in another company saw his network administrator hack
into the employee yahoo email mailbox successfully. He mentioned it was
quick and in minutes the network admin know the password of the email
account.





Regards,
Donald
