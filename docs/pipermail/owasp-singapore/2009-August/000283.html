Subject: [Owasp-singapore] Need advise on a solution to encrypt emails being sent from SAP and other systems














Hi Security Gurus,

Our company has this problem of sending invoice (and other files) via email unencrypted. The files are coming from our core systems such as SAP, then sent through a relay and then to the recipient. In this scenario, we are unable to encrypt the email.

One option we are thinking is using gateway mail encryption. But is there any other better solution than this? Appreciate your advise/feedback. Thanks!

Regards,
Ruel
