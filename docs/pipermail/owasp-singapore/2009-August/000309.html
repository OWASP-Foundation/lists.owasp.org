<PRE>Hi everyone,

Sorry on my previous incomplete email.

One of my friend working in another company, saw his network admin hack into
1 of the ex employee yahoo email account successfully. It was fast, and it
was in minutes. The interesting fact is the network admin joined the company
1 week after the ex employee left.

My bet was the ex employee left sensitive info of his email account, logged
in the network. That could be the reason why the network admin able to log
into his yahoo so quickly. Don't think is yahoo email account insecure.

Any other ways u guys can think off?

Regards,
Donald
