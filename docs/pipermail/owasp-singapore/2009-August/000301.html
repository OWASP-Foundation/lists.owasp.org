<PRE>Seems like the job market is picking up.... 
Good news for all of us. :-)

This time round, there is a job position for a technical manager, project manager or senior manager (depending on your experience) in the IT Security Office in a Taiwan wafer-fab giant. Hence, you will be required to be located in lovely Taiwan.

Responsibility: (The role is responsible for one of below tasks)
1. Lead projects of critical information protection, high security design,
security operation center set-up, network/ computer forensics, identity and
access management, SOA security, Web security,  and the other related IT
security tasks.
2. As an architect, design high availability and disaster recovery of IT
system, majority in the application level high availability design.

Requirements:

* At lease 8-year experience in general IT.
* At lease 3-year experience in the related specialized field mentioned in
the responsibility (e.g. forensic, high availability application).
* Planning and organizational skills, as well as sound, independent
judgment.
* Good command of oral and written English (Mandarin is preferred but not
the limitation)
* Certification in MCSE, CISSP, CISA a plus.
* Database knowledge with SQL Server and Oracle a plus.

If you meet the above requirements and wish to work in Taiwan, please drop me a note so that I can link you up with my friend.

Again, I am not a professional recruiter and not paid for sharing this job position.
I hope the group benefits from sharing of such job opportunities among fellow IS pros.

Cheers
Onn Chee
