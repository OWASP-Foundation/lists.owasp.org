<PRE>Please refer to the attached screenshot.

Are Singapore websites now being targeted to distribute malware hosted
in other countries?
(If you can recall, victims of such attacks mostly do not end up hosting
the malware themselves.
They only acts as &quot;tour guides&quot; to trick visitors to download and
install malware hosted elsewhere)

It feels eerie that such a large organisation, Frasers, is also hit by
such attacks just when we are having a good online discussion on this topic.

Good thing is that the Fraser Centrepoint Trust web server is currently
unblocked by Google Safebrowsing as of 5pm 27 Aug 2009.

As a IS group, what do you think we should do to address this budding trend?

Regards
Onn Chee
