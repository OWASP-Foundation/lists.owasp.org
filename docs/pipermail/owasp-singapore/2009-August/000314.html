<PRE>&quot;The possibility is endless.&quot; I can't agree more.

Just to add on,
In this situation, if I am put into the position to get the account ASAP, I
would use social engineering to archive it. One simple way is to &quot;convince&quot;
the (robot) administrator that you need to recover your password.

I am not sure if I should post this, but I guess it probably no longer
works anyway. One of the way to &quot;craft&quot; the email to the robot admin so
that it nicely gives you the (resetted) password of the target account. It
(used) to work on many mail server. Well, another common use of this
tactics also created a lot of &quot;cases&quot; for my friends in the SPF due to
hijacking of accounts in popular MMORPG.

 Hi,                                                                        
                                                                            
 First time replying here. Just my 2 cents, I think he specifically         
 mentioned that the Admin joined the company after the victim left the      
 company.                                                                   
                                                                            
 If that is the case, then the Admin wouldn't have been able to hijack any  
 session. Please correct me if I am wrong.                                  
                                                                            
 If there is no physical means to obtain the information (post-it notes for 
 example =) ), then could it be possible that the company keeps a history   
 of all information passing the gateway? I know my company keep tracks of   
 the websites that the employee's visit. However, I do not know if they     
 keep a log of additional information passed.                               
                                                                            
 Also, considering that the victim 'left' the company, usually the Admin    
 would be required to 'cleanup' the workstation that the victim was using.  
 The Admin could have tapped into the PC itself to retrieve the             
 'remembered' passwords. The possibility is endless.                        
                                                                            
 I am not a professional when it comes to security, just my 2 cents and     
 someone please correct me if I am thinking in the wrong direction.         
                                                                            
 Thank you.

     The following could had happened:                                      
                                                                            
     1. The user did not login using SSL, which makes all username and      
 password

     2. The administrator simple hijacked the session to obtain a valid     
 login.                                                                     
     3. The user simply pasted his password on some post-it which can be    
 seen.
