<PRE>CVSS is one of the simple answer, but also one of the hardest to implement
because to use this effectively, you need to understand the impact
(business sometimes).

If you had used a tool to find the vulnerability, usually there is a High,
Medium, Low etc associated with the risk.

In any case, the general formula of &quot;Impact x Probability&quot; always works.

Hi Security Gurus,

Here I am again asking for some advise. And Im sure this is not the last,
so I hope you dont get fed up with me. ;-p

Do you know of any simplest way to score application vulnerability (or
threat rating system, or whatever you call them)?

Basically, I am doing a security assessment of an in-house application (not
web-based). I have discovered a few vulnerabilities. But now, I want to
rank the vulnerabilities so that we can prioritize which one needs to be
fixed first.

Thanks a lot!

Regards,
Ruel
