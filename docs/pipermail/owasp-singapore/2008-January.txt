Confusion?   Wanted to clear up a couple of quick email questions that
resulted in a few replies to the email that was sent concerning OWASP
Membership that was sent out?

 

   1. If your corporation is a member, then you are a member ;) and that
      membership is for a 12 month term from date or sign-up

 

   2. If you?re an individual member that is for a 12 month term from
      the month you sign up.

 

   3. If you?re a OWASP Chapter leader, led by example to your local
      membership

 

   4. What is the URL to become a member ~ 
      http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership

 

   5. OWASP values your volunteerism and we want to promote membership
      as much as possible at the corporate level and the individual to
      support our projects as a 501(3)c non-profit for a 12-month term.
      One of the benefits of OWASP membership is utilization of the
      OWASP Linked?In membership group.  AS you are aware there is no
      ?fee? associated to be member of the OWASP mailing list for your
      local chapter or to continue to use the OWASP (www.owasp.org)
      materials for free.  OWASP Foundation will continue to give away
      thousands of dollars to developers for OWASP projects with your
      help and ongoing support.   

 

See: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Funds_available_for_OWASP_Projects

 

Thank you for your continued support and we encourage you to apply for
grant money to make OWASP better for you and your pocket.

Anyone who has a suggestion for venue?

To discuss security related topics in general. I will share a few,
quite obvious, insights regarding identity theft. I am sure that other
members also have interesting topics to share with us.

Best regards
 Michael Boman

	Meetup tomorrow
Message-ID: <48989dd70801090823wea74bbcs2aff2f3c0a83f60a@mail.gmail.com>

We now have a new venue, as noted above, which is a nice Irish pub
called SODS, located on the left-hand side of Tras Street if you are
coming from the Tanjong Pagar MRT station.

As usual we don't have a set agenda, mainly because that would suggest
that there is some sort of hierarchy in the group - which there isn't
one. But here is some sort of structure how the night should turn out:

Around 7pm: People turn up at SODS, say "Hi" to each other and gets
their first drink (please note: if we get enough people attending I
think we can get a group discount, but I think the group needs to be
10 people or more - so bring a friend!).

I will table a discussion on how easy it is to acquire and misuse
someone's identity in Singapore (which was planned for the December
meetup, but was canceled last minute). I will also again bring my lock
pick set and some practice locks for those who are interested trying
it out and various other gadgets people might find interesting.

Then it's up to YOU: What will You bring to the table? A good story
perhaps? Please remember, this is not a formal fancy sort of event -
there is NO power point requirement or even prepared material. Your
view of things is very much appreciated as well. Don't have anything
of your own? Don't worry - bring a print-out of a interesting news
story you want to share and/or discuss. Mine will be this one:
http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/01/dreamliner_security.
Perhaps you are looking for tools for your security kit? Let us other
know, we might have already found the tool you are looking for.

When we have run out of topics to discuss we will adjourn the meetup -
which last time was 10-11pm (there was some difficulties to get a taxi
at the time).

If you haven't already done so, please RSVP for the event - even if
you are not coming. The link to the event is:
http://security.meetup.com/77/calendar/6905698/

I hope to see you at the meetup tomorrow. If you get lost you can
always reach me at 96942601.

Best regards

I meant to keep the Web Hackings update as a weekly update, but it seems
that events are much more frequent. We have three new very interesting web
hacking incidents in just two days as a preview into how 2008 might look
like:

WHID 2007-82, An SQL injection Mass Robot - a very massive attack (>100,000
sites) using SQL injection to add malware distributing code to web site 
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2007-82.shtml)

WHID 2008-02: Italian Bank's XSS Opportunity Seized by Fraudsters - Active
exploit of an XSS vulnerability for rewrite style phishing
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-02.shtml)

WHID 2008-01: Information stolen from geeks.com - A data breach leaking to
information leakage in a site that has Hacker Safe certificate
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-01.shtml)
