Message-ID: <4D5B530C.1030503@usa.net>

Hi,

Google have enabled 2FA SMS for all Google Apps users.

Do remember to enable the 2FA feature for better protection.

Also note your email client access will be changed to a new complex
password issued by Google as email clients do not support 2FA.

Cheers!

Hi folks,

In response to some queries, the normal personal Gmail accounts are also
2FA capable.
Just need to enable it in your account settings.
