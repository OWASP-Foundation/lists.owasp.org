Hello all,

I am delighted to announce that the popular course "The Art Of Exploiting
Injection Flaws" will be run at upcoming BRUCON event.

Details about the course and registration info can be found here:
http://2013.brucon.org/index.php/Training_Injection

After running the course at several Black Hat, Appsec, HITB and other
events, I am looking forward to my first ever BRUCON. If you do
pentest/security consultancy as day job, then this course is ideal for you
and will help you take your skills to the next level.

A small write-up about the course is here:

Thanks and see you at BRUCON!

Sid
