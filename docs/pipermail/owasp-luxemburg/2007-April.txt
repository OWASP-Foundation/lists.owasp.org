Current Luxemburg members,

OWASP and it's board has made efforts to keep this chapter open for your
area, but due to lack of content, communication with the community and not
being able to reach the chapter leader, it has been decided to combine the
Luxemburg with the Belgium chapter. This chapter has been very active and
would welcome your membership.

These account will no longer be active. You can join the new Belgian Chapter
with the following link.

To learn more about the new combined chapter, follow this link.

Thank you for your continued support.

Director of IT
OWASP
