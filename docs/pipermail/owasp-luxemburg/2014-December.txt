Dear AppSec enthousiast and OWASP affiniado,

the OWASP AppSec EU conference series are a premier gathering in the
application security domain. The 2015 event, taking place in Amsterdam from
19-22 May, is in full preparation. The program committee is still
soliciting submissions for the presentations and research tracks. The
deadlines are approaching fast:

- call for papers: 31st December 2014
- call for research: 20th January 2015

If you want to share an important advancement or opinion with the
community, or if you are looking for your 45 mins. of fame, NOW would be
the best time to consider submitting a proposal ! You will find more
information and submission instructions on the event website:
https://2015.appsec.eu/

We're looking forward to receiving your proposals and to seeing you there !
