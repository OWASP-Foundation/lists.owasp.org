All,



This is the reminder for the forthcoming full-day OWASP training on
OWASP projects and resources on this Friday?May 28, 2010. ?Signup is
open for the April session (see links at the bottom of the email) and
we have 8 spaces remaining (we have 27 OWASP'ers have RSVP'd, plus
Lloyds? staff who will be attending). RSVP closes Wednesday 3pm, so
get signed up now!?Please note that this training is free, but is
currently open to only OWASP Members. However, if you've been looking
for a good reason to join as an OWASP Member its only USD$50 to join
for a year (approximately ?33 at current exchange rates).

?? Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most?OWASP Projects?are not widely used
and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and
usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of
understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem
or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.

?? This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature
and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how
to use them.

?? If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of
the course, please bring a laptop.



To sign up for the courses, follow the registration links from here -

OWASP Project Manager
