hi,

FYI, check out the latest slide deck on the OWASP Summit here:
https://www.slideshare.net/DinisCruz/owasp-summit-2017-24-days-to-go

You can see Dinis presenting this on  the OWASP London Facebook page
https://m.facebook.com/OWASPLondon/
Look for the Live stream May event, Dinis starts his presentation about 20
minutes into the video.

If you can make it, I highly recommend registering soon, as we will soon
run out of 24h tickets!
Details/registration here: http://owaspsummit.org/

Kind regards

Seba
