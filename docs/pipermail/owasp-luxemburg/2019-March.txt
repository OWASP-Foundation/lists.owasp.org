Message-ID: <CANACS8RYEh1mXnEvd=GAGjVqSoqGfx_8YaExxjQ7aLudHd2vjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

OWASP will migrate our mailman list to Google Groups.
Mailman will then disappear on March 22nd.

You can join the group using the following link:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/luxembourg-chapter/join

You do not need to have a gmail account to access the owasp-luxemburg group.
You can find some info on how to access the google groups in the following

Subject: [Owasp-luxemburg] Security Notice. Someone have access to your
	system.
Message-ID: <AB25313E1FBF2A109E8A85A40491AB25@MEVOTWEPK>

Hello!

I have very bad news for you.
21/10/2018 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account owasp-luxemburg at lists.owasp.org

So, you can change the password, yes... But my malware intercepts it every time.

How I made it:
In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability.
I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it.
When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device.

After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).

A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock.
But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!!
I'm talk you about sites for adults.

I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course!

And I got an idea....
I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?).
After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together.
Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular!

I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues.
I think $759 is a very, very small amount for my silence.
Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time!

Pay ONLY in Bitcoins!
My BTC wallet: 1H1K8MfLEJgjCCfDEkTJmv9GJjD3XzEFGR

You do not know how to use bitcoins?
Enter a query in any search engine: "how to replenish btc wallet".
It's extremely easy

For this payment I give you two days (48 hours).
As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work.

After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically.
If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your "enjoys".

I hope you understand your situation.
- Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server)
- Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account)
- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server.

P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment!
 This is the word of honor hacker

I also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation.

Do not hold evil! I just do my job.
Have a nice day!
