Will also be an introduction to WS-Attacks, by Andreas Falkenberg, a student
at the Ruhr University Bochum, Ba?che?lor IT-Si?cher?heit /
In?for?ma?ti?ons?tech?nik, Germany

WS-Attacks.org is not a new web service standard by the OASIS Group or W3C;
instead it presents the flaws of today's web service standards and
implementations in regard to web service security! WS-Attacks.org aims at
delivering the most comprehensive enumeration of all known web service
attacks.

See you all in 2 days in Brussels for another Belgium chapter meeting.
