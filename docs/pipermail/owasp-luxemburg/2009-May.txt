Hello,

The Luxembourg Chapter will participate to the next
YAJUG<http://www.yajug.org>(Java User Group, Luxembourg) event:

*YAJUG - How to Secure your Java Applications
*Wednesday, May 27th 2009 - 17:45*

*Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor
29, avenue John F. Kennedy
L-1855 Luxembourg-Kirchberg*
*
Agenda:

*17h45* - Welcome and registration

*18h00* - *Introduction to Cryptography with JCA and JCE*, S?bastien
Stormacq, Sun Microsystems

This talk will introduce basic cryptography mechanisms such as one-way hash
functions, encryption, signature, public key cryptography, certificate etc
... in order to let everyone catch up with these very often used but rarely
understood technologies.
After having described the theoritical and the mathematical concepts used by
modern cryptography, this talk will demonstrate how to apply these in your
Java applications. We will show how to use the Java Cryptography
Architecture framework and Sun's Java Cryptography Extension providers to
actually write your own data encryption or data signature code.

*19h15* - *OWASP Top 10 Security Breaches for Java Web Applications*,
Jocelyn Aubert, OWASP-LU

The OWASP Top Ten provides a powerful awareness document for web application
security. It lists the top ten most critical web application security
vulnerabilities, and for each provides explanation, examples, means of
verification and recommendations to avoid it.
"*Adopting the OWASP Top Ten is perhaps the most effective first step
towards changing the software development culture within your organization
into one that produce secure code.*"

*20h30* - Drink

*Note:* This event is *NOT* an OWASP event! You have to register on YAJUG
website (fee: 40 euros).

Kind regards,

Belgium on September 18 and 19.

Besides presentations on IPv6 security, MPLS hacking, Cyberwarfare, Social
engineer techniques, Cloud Computing Security, Open source Information
gathering, Dangers of Social networks, and much more, there will be
interesting workshops and other events. More information about the program
