example of this is the famous OWASP top ten of most critical web application
security flaws. The OWASP community facilitates conferences, local chapters,
articles, and message forums. Participation in OWASP is free and open to
all, as are all the materials we produce.

professionals, developers, students, etc). OWASP Belgium, Netherlands and
