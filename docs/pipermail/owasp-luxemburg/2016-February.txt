Dear OWASP fellows,

We invite you to our next OWASP event: the BeNeLux OWASP Day 2016!

The OWASP BeNeLux Day 2016 will be held on March 17-18 in Esch-sur-Alzette
(Luxembourg), jointly organized by the OWASP chapters in Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg, hosted and co-organized by the University of
Luxembourg and the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and
Trust (SnT).

The OWASP BeNeLux Day 2016 offers free 1-day trainings and a free 1-day
conference.
The event will take place on 17 and 18 March 2016, in Belval Campus, in
Esch-sur-Alzette - Luxembourg.

On Thursday 17 March, four free 1-day trainings are offered:

On Friday 18 March, the 1-day conference features a line-up of various
