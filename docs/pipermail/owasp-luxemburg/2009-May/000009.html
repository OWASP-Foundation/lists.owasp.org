<PRE>Hi,

(full-disclosure: I am one of the organisers of the conference below - Seba)

OWASP Belgium is affiliated partner of BruCON:

BruCON is an annual two-day conference by and for the security and hacker
community. The conference offers lectures and workshops on a multitude of
topics like computer security, privacy, information technology and its
implications on society. It takes place at the Surfhouse in Brussels,
Belgium on September 18 and 19.

Besides presentations on IPv6 security, MPLS hacking, Cyberwarfare, Social
engineer techniques, Cloud Computing Security, Open source Information
gathering, Dangers of Social networks, and much more, there will be
interesting workshops and other events. More information about the program
is available on www.brucon.org. The content will be updated as time
progresses so keep an eye on our website.

Visitors are welcome to actively contribute to the conference. Do you have a
topic to discuss like a tool, a website, your blog or any project that could
be interesting to others, please submit it as a lightning talk on our wiki.
Do you any suggestions or questions about our event? Feel free to contact us
at crew_at_brucon.org.

Normal registration fees (including VAT) for BruCON are:

   - 180 Euro early bird (prior to July 1st 2009)

Seba
