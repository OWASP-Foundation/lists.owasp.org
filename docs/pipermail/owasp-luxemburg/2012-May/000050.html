Sorry, the &quot;When&quot; part of that message was copied from another text which
was based on a template from last month.  The OWASP Austin meeting is on
Tuesday, May 29th from 11:30 AM -1 PM CST.  We typically do a chapter
update sometime around 11:45 with the actual meeting content beginning at
noon CST.

Also, for anyone who had difficulty joining us online last month because
the meeting was full, our apologies.  We will be trying out a new
GoToMeeting Webinar format which should support almost 4x the number of
people we were maxed at last time.  We look forward to you joining us.

May OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting.*

*When:* Tuesday, May 29th, from 11:30 AM -1:00 PM CST

*Topic:* Closing the Window of Opportunity
&#8220;Closing the window of opportunity&#8221; and will be discussing the state of web
application security based on recent statistics drawn from WhiteHat&#8217;s
database of thousands of sites under service and the characteristics of a
program that can help organizations develop a strong web security posture
and reduce or eliminate the opportunities attackers have to compromise
their applications.

This will be a product agnostic presentation, of course, though we will be
using WhiteHat data (along with Jim&#8217;s long experience) to present the
problems we see and how we can go about solving them.
