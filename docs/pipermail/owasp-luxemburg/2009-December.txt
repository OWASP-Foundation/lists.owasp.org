Hi,

The largest BeNeLux OWASP event on record has come to an end.

We had a great day, stuffed with presentations and the OWASP Live CD /
WebGoat workshop.

All the presentations are available for download in the Agenda tab.

/dev/random covered the event in his blog post "OWASP Benelux Day 2009"

If you have more photo's or blog posts, e-mail seba at owasp.org to share
them online.

See you all next year in the Netherlands or Luxembourg!

Kind regards,

BeNeLux Day 2009 Program Committee:

Bart De Win / Sebastien Deleersnyder (OWASP Belgium)
Ferdinand Vroom / Martin Knobloch (OWASP Netherlands)
Jocelyn Aubert (OWASP Luxembourg)
