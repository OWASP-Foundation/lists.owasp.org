hi,

We had a great OWASP BeNeLux event last year, and ended up making some
extra profit.

We want to invest some of our profits by sponsoring 3 Open Security Summit
tickets.
The value is about 1.600 GBP each, covering shared accommodation and access
to the summit venue for the whole week.
(for more info - https://open-security-summit.org)

Please submit your candidacy listing:
1) why we would sponsor you?
2) the working session(s) you will be organising?
3) the outcome for the community?

Please use the Google form here: https://goo.gl/forms/qyKIn2SEkH7ZnO1L2
We will consider all applications that have reached us (Martin & myself)
before 21st of April 2018.

Looking forward to see you at the summit!

Kind regards

Seba, Martin and the OWASP BeNeLux team
