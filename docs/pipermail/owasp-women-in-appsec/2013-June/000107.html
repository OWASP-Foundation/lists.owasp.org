<PRE>I've made a few additions. Have a look and tell us what you think?
Thank you for putting this together, Helen.


The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security. As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from
North America to attend OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in
November of 2013.
**OBJECTIVES**
OWASP&#8217;s current program objective is to encourage female students at
both the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a
career in information security and/or application development, to
expand their skills and pursue application security. Attendance for two
women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013 conference, and at least one of
the in-depth training sessions, will be the award for this year&#8217;s
winners. The Women in AppSec Program was successfully launched at
AppSec USA in 2011 this year&#8217;s event hopes to build on that trend and
further engage women in the community.
Please use the form below to submit your application to us.
Additionally, please contact Samantha Groves at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">Samantha.Groves at owasp.org</A> if you have any questions about the program.
