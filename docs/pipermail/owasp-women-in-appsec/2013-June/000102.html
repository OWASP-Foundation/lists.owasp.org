<PRE>
Dear Committee,

First of all, thank you very much for your effort to bring up female workforce in AppSec.
I have been working in the same area in a university setting.
I am Grace Park,  an assistant professor in Computer Science at University of Central Oklahoma, primarily teaching university&gt;
I have taught computer security with AppSec, have led a team called Female Warriors for Enterprise Security in my university through a small grant, and have published papers related to AppSec education and female inclusion in Security Area last two years. (Please refer to my web page below)

In the last meeting at OWASP OKC chapter, I heard about a scholarship from another member.
In order to further develop my skills, I would like to apply for the scholarship if it is open.

My questions are

1)      Is the scholarship available?

2)      Am I eligible for the scholarship?

3)      What is required to apply for the scholarship?

4)      Do you have a blog to communicate among the female members?

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Myung Ah (Grace) Park, Ph.D
Assistant Professor
Computer Science
University of Central Oklahoma
