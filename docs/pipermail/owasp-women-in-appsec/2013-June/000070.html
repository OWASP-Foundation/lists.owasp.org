<PRE>Hello All,

I am just sending this copy for you to review once again. Not much has
changed other than the addition of the blurb from Tara. Thank you Lorna for
reaching out to the previous winners for this. Below is the draft. Please
make any comments, additions, needed.

Can we call this copy finalised even without the other winner's blurb? What
do you all think? Have a read and let me know. I would like to start
pushing this out to potential sponsors asap.

Thank you, Team.

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November of
2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP&#8217;s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information
security and/or application development, to expand their skills and pursue
application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA
2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will
be the award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec Program was
successfully launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event hopes to
build on that trend and further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to the
AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page&lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/</A>&gt;
.

*Past Winners*

Being fortunate enough to receive the Women in AppSec grant is a unique and
valuable experience. It is a great opportunity for women to have a chance
to bolster their skills and dive deep into the world of application
security. I found that attending the conference was not only a great way to
experience what the OWASP community has to offer, but it also gives
students a chance to network with a great group of people who are
passionate about their field and willing to share a wealth of information.
~ Tara Wilson, 2011 Winner
