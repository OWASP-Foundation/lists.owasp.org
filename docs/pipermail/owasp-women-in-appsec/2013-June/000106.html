<PRE>Hello OWASP Chapter Leaders,

I just wanted to reach out and introduce myself. My name is Samantha
Groves, and I am the Projects Manager here at OWASP. This year, I am
helping organize the Women in AppSec
Program&lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-women-in-application-security-appsec-program/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-women-in-application-security-appsec-program/</A>&gt;
for
AppSec USA taking place in New York City.

The program objective is to encourage female students at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels, instructors, and professional working
women who are dedicated to a career in information security and/or
application development, to expand their skills and pursue application
security.

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program, and this is why I am reaching out to you today.
We are seeking $6,000 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation for 2 participants. If your chapter is interested in taking a
leadership role in launching this great sponsorship opportunity please get
in touch with me as soon as possible. There is no minimum amount required
to help fund the initiatives as any little bit helps us get closer to our
program goals.

If you are interested in sponsoring this initiative, please do reach out to
me and let me know of your interest.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sam Groves
