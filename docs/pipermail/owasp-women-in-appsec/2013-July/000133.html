<PRE>Hello Team,
I just wanted to reach out so we can finalize the form we are going to
be using to accept applicants. We have already managed to raise $4,000
for the program so I feel comfortable making this live. I think we
should certainly make it clear that each participant only gets 2K as
reimbursement right now, unless we are able to raise the remaining 2K.
Have a look at the form, and let me know if you have any changes. I
would like to open this up for submission by the end of this week or
the beginning of the next.
Thank you, Team.

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.
**OBJECTIVES**
OWASP&#8217;s current program objective is to encourage female students and
professionals to expand their skills and pursue careers in application
security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013
conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will be
the award for this year&#8217;s winners. The Women in AppSec Program was
successfully launched at in 2011. This year&#8217;s event hopes to build on
that trend and further engage women in the community.
Please use the form below to submit your application. The application
deadline is Monday, September 09, 2013 at 5pm GMT. Contact Samantha
Groves at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">Samantha.Groves at owasp.org</A> if you have any questions about the
program.
Please visit the OWASP AppSec 2013: Women in Security Program page to
