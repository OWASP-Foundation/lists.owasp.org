<PRE>Hi Sarah,

I am just sending over the copy and the form that we will need to put up on
the website. This doesn't have to be done today. we can wait to launch it
on Monday. See below for copy amendments/additions, and a link to the live
form. The copy amendments are in red.
------------------------------------------

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security. As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November
of 2013.


*Objectives*

OWASP&#8217;s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels, instructors, and professional
working women who are dedicated to a career in information security and/or
application development, to expand their skills and pursue application
security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013
conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will be the
award for this year&#8217;s winners. The Women in AppSec Program was successfully
launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year&#8217;s event hopes to build on that
trend and further engage women in the community.
