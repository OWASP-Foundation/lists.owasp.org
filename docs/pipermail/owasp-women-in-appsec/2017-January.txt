I meant it as an example to inform how we provide grants, I wasn't thinking
we would apply for it.

I missed the last call, but I wanted to chime in here because I have some
experience working on scholarships (I was at HPE and part of the efforts to
give SWSIS
<http://cra.org/cra-w/scholarships-and-awards/scholarships/swsis/> 250k),
so I have some research on different scholarship/grant efforts for women in
security. I'd be happy to dig it up, update and share.

It's also worth noting that I went from HPE to a startup that has a pretty
small conference budget, so I actually applied for and received one of
those USENIX scholarships this year...

Thanks,
Joy

Great! Yes, having experience in that area - it will be helpful if you want
to help with "grant making" and scholarship programs for WIA and OWASP.
Best wishes, Bev

Hello WIA Team,

I was wondering if there was anything planned for the upcoming RSA
conference? Do we have a gathering or lunch or anything planned at this
time? If not, are we wanting to do something?

Thank you,

Nothing is planned for RSA.  I'm not attending, but perhaps if enough of
you are attending, then you could gather informally?

If you all decide to meet, could you share the meeting time / location

I wouldn't mind doing CFP review, have done that for a couple of cons. When is the event?

Subject: [Women_in_security] Committee Roles
Message-ID: <CACtAMnPpQ4erVNP3FxYEOdTrGiuuNYPeEiiZfMuiLdtaAxoKtg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello WIA Committee,

We're contemplating adopting roles to give some structure to the WIA
Committee and allow folks to take responsibility for certain aspects of the
committee.

To that end, I'm looking for feedback on the following roles, and if you
agree, also let me know if you want yourself considered for one or more
roles.  We could make it so each role has two or three people fill it,
which would spread out the work load and avoids gaps when people are
unavailable (e.g. two Secretaries, three Treasurers, etc).  Or we can have
a structureless committee that decides by consensus, or adopt a
dictatorship model (just checking if you're reading).  Here are the roles,
the thought is they'd be by calendar year and in December we decide on who
is filling the next year's roles.


Chair - runs meetings, keeps meetings on track, fosters dialog, etc.

Vice-Chair (or co-Chair?) - backup for Chair

Secretary - schedules meetings and agendas, take attendance, captures
meeting minutes, captures decisions, is responsible for the paperwork
required by Committee 2.0 model, maintains voting member list, etc.

Treasurer - tracks funds, prepares budgets, handles donations and
sponsorships, etc.

Volunteer Coordinator - recruits and organizes volunteers, tracks
participation, etc.

Special project leaders - responsible for a special project, such as
mentoring, special event training, etc.


Please note that the Committee 2.0 model requires that you be an OWASP
member in order to have a leadership position on the committee.  If you're
not an OWASP member, you can still participate and volunteer in one of the
areas mentioned above, but you'll be on a sub-committee (or alternatively,
you can join OWASP).

Looking forward to feedback on the above.

Thanks,

- Bil

Hi Bil, These look good. I generally recommend that there also be a backup
for each role, or some kind of way to fill in if someone has to step down
at some point. This often happens with committees and it is nice to have
them filled quickly. Especially with volunteer groups, it is nice to have
another volunteer shadow the role in case of an emergency, when they could
fill in until a replacement is elected. Sincerely, Bev
