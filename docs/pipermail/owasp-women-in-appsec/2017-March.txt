Hello Everyone,

In preparation for our meeting on Wednesday, I have a few items:

   1. *BY TUESDAY: *If there is something you want to add to the agenda,
   please let me know or add a comment to the agenda doc
   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RrUIrAgdL5llFXrZF0z4mmoGFPwN6uFKsscxQPXabDk/edit>
   .
   2. *BY WEDNESDAY: *Please review the draft of committee
   roles/responsibilities
   <https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1fSGvzbOeV7O-rdA_PS75SpatO6hOzntCGKoJwiJ1QAc/edit?usp=sharing>
   and add your thoughts.
   3. *BY WEDNESDAY: *Please review the suggested goals and select the top
   three in priority order you think the committee should focus on
   <https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdM4BtKNiubrjCDnOM2mFstILMfUN2hx_6RKIz3MBHFxxhr-A/viewform?usp=sf_link>.
   If you noted your choices in the previous meeting you don't need to worry
   about this, unless you want to change your mind in which case I'll swap out
   your old choices for the new ones.

Let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to talking with you
all on Wednesday!

Hello Everyone,

This thread is to start a discussion about how the WIA funds should be
allocated this coming year. To start, I will offer these suggestions

   1. Events at EU Conference (May 2017)
   2. Events at USA Conference (October 2017)

This conversation will likely evolve once the committee's goals have been
prioritized, but let's start getting ideas out there!

Best,

I agree on the suggestions, I would like to add something conected with

WIA awareness creation,
Other Women in IT Group cooperation

perhaps the above points do not involve funding, but can be items to be
analysed.

bye Loredana.

One option to consider, and I already sent something to Emily about this,
is having representation at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in
Computing. Not sure what the costs would be.

Hi, I am not sure if we have had a March meeting yet. I did not get the
invite for the Feb. meeting and had to have it resent to me and I want to
make sure I am not missing future meetings. Can someone ensure that I am on
the list to receive the meeting invites? Also, is there a March meeting
scheduled? Did I miss that one?

Thanks!
Wendy Zenone

Hi Wendy,

The March meeting already took place on March 8, apologies you were not
aware it took place.  We do use the WIA list to announce the meeting times,
and I double-checked, there were emails related to the planning and
scheduling of the March meeting:


The March meeting Doodle poll was sent Feb 13 (to determine when the March
meeting should take place):
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/appsec_usa_women_in_security/2017-February/000304.html

The meeting invite was sent on February 26:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/appsec_usa_women_in_security/2017-February/000320.html

The reminder was sent March 5:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/appsec_usa_women_in_security/2017-March/000325.html


You might try subscribing to the non-digest version of the WIA list,
perhaps that will make a difference?  If not, you can always check the
archives to ensure you're not missing any emails:

The April meeting hasn't been discussed or scheduled yet.

Hello APPSEC Women,

My name is Wendy Durica and I am working on my Capstone project for my
Masters of Science in Software Engineering at Fairfield University. This
project is a study of natural language used in Social Engineering attacks
on women. It has been approved by the university ethics board.   I am
interested in having professional women in the IT security take my survey
and/or sharing any stories they have about social engineering attacks over
the phone at a business.

I have made the survey on a Google Form.  I can send the form to
individuals who would like to take the survey or you can post this for
people to come to take the survey.
Here is the link:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_9FrLfY9gjCwPaARplF8-5_A9DA9L0nTsU9DIvijqS8lsQ/viewform?usp=sf_link

Thank you for your help.

Best Regards,
Wendy Durica

Hello, thank you for your inquiry.  I would not be able to post your survey
globally, however, I would encourage you to reach out to our Women in
AppSec committee team.  Their mailing list information is here:
