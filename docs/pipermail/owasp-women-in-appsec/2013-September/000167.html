<PRE>I believe it is our goal to get women involved in AppSec, this is done by providing knowledge, networking and mentoring. Also, the list isn&#8217;t a qualification list, but more of a score card to guide us into choosing the right candidate for this honorarium.

 

The question is why would we give away $3000 worth of training and expenses if someone doesn&#8217;t know anything about OWASP or someone who has never at least been motivated enough to attend a meeting. Maybe I am slightly biased since we have several women working in companies and attending school that attend NYC and NJ OWASP meetings. The checklist listed below is not the most current one, Samantha has made some  changes based on team suggestions.

 

The updated criteria below is sorted by points. There seem to be 4 categories: Experience (12 points), References (11), Interest (2) and OWASP member (2). This is the 5th edition. Albeit not perfect, it has included everybody's input. Let's finalize it before Sept. 9 as planned.

 


Criteria

Points


Has provided 2 responsive contacts as reference, and both references are familiar with the candidate, application security, and OWASP.

6


Both references have provided letters of recommendation.

5


Has relevant/appropriate achievement goals for attending the conference.

5


Is traveling from the North American region.

	

Has background in volunteering for OWASP or similar organizations.

2


Has participated in one of OWASP's programs or activities?

2


Is either studying, wishing to study, working in AppSec, or interested in working in AppSec.

2


Has financial need.

2


Is a paid OWASP member, and/or employer/school is an OWASP sponsor.

2


Has an interest in exploring application security

I think if the programs goal was to get women interested in AppSec it should have been called &#8220;Women Interested In AppSec&#8221; not &#8220;Women In AppSec&#8221; it&#8217;s a bit misleading. You&#8217;d have a better result getting people &#8220;interested&#8221; through an interactive webinar where they can ask questions and build a rapport with various presenters. Then you take the presentation and post on youtube in an OWASP Women In AppSec channel. Have links to register for the next WebEx. Then again, these are my opinions based on my experiences in security and financial services training.

Have a great Friday, and let&#8217;s keep working strong to have all the kinks ironed out for Monday&#8217;s deadline.

Great Job Everyone!

There are a couple of criteria points that I would disagree with. Since the original goal of the program was to get women interested in OWASP and Application Security in general. I think it goes against this goal to make it a criteria with points attached to have the applicant have previously attend an OWASP event, activity, have volunteered with OWASP previously, or be an OWASP member. I also think it is a mistake to have a qualification that the applicant be a student. 
The original intent was outreach and inclusion, where this comes off as you already have to be a member of the &quot;club&quot; to be considered.

 

Just my opinion, 

 

Lorna

Hello Women in AppSec Selection Team,

 

We've gotten off to a great start, and now it's time to get the conversation started once again. We are now in version 4 of our selection criteria drafts. I have taken all of the communication I've received from different team members, and I have consolidated all of the comments/suggestions into this new list. Please review, and comment/suggest any changes/revisions to the team.
