<PRE>There are a couple of criteria points that I would disagree with. Since the original goal of the program was to get women interested in OWASP and Application Security in general. I think it goes against this goal to make it a criteria with points attached to have the applicant have previously attend an OWASP event, activity, have volunteered with OWASP previously, or be an OWASP member. I also think it is a mistake to have a qualification that the applicant be a student. 
The original intent was outreach and inclusion, where this comes off as you already have to be a member of the &quot;club&quot; to be considered.

Just my opinion, 

Lorna
