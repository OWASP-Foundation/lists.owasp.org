as we discuss methods to gain valuable work-based experience.


A common barrier to entering the cybersecurity workforce is the lack of
related work experience that is often expected by employers - a dilemma for
both employers facing a cybersecurity workforce shortage and job seekers
who are looking to start a career in cybersecurity. While there are some
traditional ways for students or job seekers to develop work experience,
the cybersecurity talent gap demands more creative approaches and may
require a paradigm shift. This webinar will focus on a variety of
underutilized and emerging work-based learning or experiential learning
methods such as internships, cooperative education, apprenticeships, and
more.

*Technical Advisor III: Senior Gender Advisor*

Priority Populations, Integration & Rights Division, Office of HIV/AIDS,
Bureau for Global Health, United States Agency for International Development
Location: Arlington, Virginia
Assignment: One year fellowship
GHFP-II-P7-258

The Global Health Fellows Program (*GHFP-II*) is a cooperative agreement
implemented and managed by the Public Health Institute in partnership with
Global Health Corps, GlobeMed, Management Systems International and PYXERA
Global. GHFP-II is supported by the US Agency for International Development
(USAID).

GHFP-II?s goal is to improve the effectiveness of USAID health programs by
addressing the Agency?s immediate and emerging human capacity needs. The
program seeks to accomplish this goal first through the recruitment,
placement and support of diverse health professionals at the junior, mid
and senior levels. These program participants include fellows, interns,
corporate volunteers and Foreign Service National professionals. The
program then provides substantial performance management and career
development support to participants, including annual work planning
assistance, and ensures that professional development opportunities are
available.

Looking to the future, GHFP-II also seeks to establish a pool of
highly-qualified global health professionals that will ensure the Agency?s
ongoing technical leadership and effectiveness. This objective is supported
by an extensive outreach program that brings global health opportunities
and specialized career advice to a diverse range of interested individuals,
with a particular focus on those underrepresented in the field of global
health.

*BACKGROUND:*

USAID has been, and continues to be, at the forefront of the US Government
(USG) response in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic since inception
of its international HIV/AIDS program in 1986 with HIV/AIDS programs in
nearly 100 countries worldwide. The Agency is a key partner in the
President?s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the largest commitment
ever made by any nation for an international health initiative dedicated to
a single disease ? a multi-year, multi-billion dollar, multifaceted
approach to combating the disease in more than 120 countries around the
world.

The Office of HIV and AIDS in the USAID Bureau for Global Health (GH/OHA)
is the focus of HIV/AIDS technical leadership for the Agency and has
primary responsibility for leading the Agency?s efforts within PEPFAR.
USAID provides global technical leadership on the full range of issues
related to HIV and AIDS prevention, care, and treatment; manages numerous
research and field support programs; and monitors the impact of the
Agency?s HIV/AIDS programs. The Priority Populations, Integration, and
Rights (PPIR) Division, where this position will be situated, consists of
teams dedicated to various HIV/AIDS-focused technical areas including
gender and key populations, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), youth,
and HIV integration in FP and nutrition services.

in the design, implementation and evaluation of technically sound,
cost-effective and practical approaches and strategies for the

treatment services. This position will interface with other USAID bureaus,
sister agencies within PEPFAR, and multilateral organizations such as the
World Health Organization.

*ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:*

The Senior Advisor will work closely with internal USAID/OHA technical
services branches, the strategic information branch, and the PEPFAR
interagency Gender Technical Working Group (TWG). S/he will work closely

assistance on programming for gender. The Senior Advisor will be
responsible for:

   - Serving as an HIV/AIDS subject matter expert in the area of gender
   issues and specifically those affecting testing and counseling services;
   treatment adherence and retention programs; behavior and structural
   prevention; and gender-based violence prevention and response services.

   - Contributing to the implementation of USAID?s Gender Equality and
   Female Empowerment Policy and the USG Strategy to Prevent and Respond to
   Gender-Based Violence (GBV) globally in the context of HIV/AIDS programs.
   - Maintaining knowledge of current literature, research, policies and
   programmatic experiences both domestically and internationally in order to
   recommend appropriate approaches and best practices for gender programs.
   - Serving on the PEPFAR interagency technical working group for Gender
   and Adolescent Girls and as part of GH Gender Advisors Team.
   - Reviewing the technical quality of projects by conducting site visits
   to country program locations and providing technical assistance on program
   implementation, monitoring progress and evaluating performance, reviewing
   and analyzing results, and recommending changes in implementation.
   Arranging for outside reviews as needed. Facilitating sharing of best
   practices across USG programs in different countries.
   - Serving as a expert technical advisor for activities relating to
   gender, supported through USAID centrally-funded mechanisms. Providing
   technical support for the development of partner work plans, written
   reviews of work plans and work products, and overall guidance on program
   implementation.

CyberSeek

A *free* cybersecurity workforce and career resource.

Several new features have been added to CyberSeek to provide greater
visibility into the supply and demand of cybersecurity workers at the
national, state, and metropolitan levels.

One key new feature of the CyberSeek heat map is the ability to track data
on cybersecurity job demand overall and within the public and private
sectors.The CyberSeek career pathway, which maps to the NICE Cybersecurity
Workforce Framework
<http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcxMTA3LjgwNTE5OTYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MTEwNy44MDUxOTk2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MjYxNjY0JmVtYWlsaWQ9YmV2Y29yd2luQGdtYWlsLmNvbSZ1c2VyaWQ9YmV2Y29yd2luQGdtYWlsLmNvbSZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&&&102&&&https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework>,
has also been enhanced to help both individuals interested in cybersecurity
careers and employers looking to fill job openings. The expanded,
interactive career pathway includes information on 10 core cybersecurity
roles and 5 tech jobs that often serve as ?feeder roles? to cybersecurity
positions.

The updated site also includes an embeddable heat map and career pathway
widgets. Anyone interested in the cybersecurity workforce can embed
versions of the heat map and career pathway on their websites with links

Global Voices in International Law: International Courts and Women Judges
<http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/20171205_WomenJudges_Registration.html>

*Decisions made in international courts affect women around the world. Yet
women occupy less than 19% of seats on international courts and tribunals. *

The lack of women's voices in the international judiciary prevents
inclusive decision-making on issues that directly impact their daily lives.
The desire to create inclusive and representative institutions at all
levels of decision-making should consider the importance of creating equal
oppportunities for women's representation on international courts.

Please join the Wilson Center's Women in Public Service Project and Africa
Program and the Institute for African Women in Law for a conversation on
the importance of inclusion on international courts and strategies to
achieve equal representation in these institutions.
