Welcome to the WHPC October Newsletter! Below you can find out about all of
our activities this November during the week of SC17. This is the largest
set of activities that we have ever put on during one week, and we have
tried to provide something for everyone. We hope you can join us in
November.
There is still time to take advantage of the SC17 early bird discount, but
make sure you register by 15th October to take advantage of this. For many
of our activities during SC week you will need some form of SC
registration, which is handled by the conference, not by WHPC. To find out
what you need, check out our quick registration guide
&lt;<A HREF="https://womeninhpc.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=007abbb94048819c6eb6815c9&amp;id=09b347ef58&amp;e=48ec218961">https://womeninhpc.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=007abbb94048819c6eb6815c9&amp;id=09b347ef58&amp;e=48ec218961</A>&gt;

  We Need Your Help!

During the week of SC17 we will have a special &#8216;Women in HPC&#8217; awareness day
on Tuesday, 14th November. We are seeking volunteers &#8212; men and women are
both welcome &#8212; to be ambassadors for Women in HPC, wear a WHPC &amp; Diversity
T-shirt, and spread the word about the importance and benefits of diversity.
To be a WHPC ambassador you don&#8217;t have to be an expert in diversity. We
will provide a cheat sheet of key diversity facts and additional guidance
on how to get people engaged in the topic.
Sign Up to Be a WHPC Ambassador

7th International WHPC Workshop: Diversifying the HPC Community

The Seventh International WHPC workshop is a full day event, bringing
together women and their allies and advocates from across the HPC
community. This workshop will focus on supporting two key groups: women and
their employers. The morning session will provide a discussion on the
skills needed to thrive in an HPC career.

We particularly encourage early- and mid-career women to attend, but we
welcome all, including men, to participate and contribute to this session.
The afternoon will be dedicated to identifying how employers, managers, and
hirers can make the workplace a more inclusive environment, identifying and
overcoming the roadblocks that face women and other underrepresented groups
in the workplace. To attend please make sure you register for an SC17
workshop pass

BoF &#8212; Women in HPC: Non-Traditional Paths to HPC and How They Can and Do
Enrich the Field Wednesday, 15th November, 12:15 pm &#8211; 1:15 pm

In this BoF we examine how to broaden the community&#8217;s perceptions to access
a more diverse talent pool. We will hear from three women who came to HPC
from non-standard directions, followed by discussion with audience
participation on how to recruit from non-traditional backgrounds and
broaden the HPC talent pool. To attend, register

BoF &#8212; Recruitment: How to Build Diverse Teams Thursday, 16th November,
12:15 pm &#8211; 1:15 pm

Diverse teams are now generally accepted as a &#8220;good idea.&#8221; That said, a
common refrain during discussions on improving diversity focuses on the
lack of women applying for jobs. This session will address improving
recruitment practices to reach more candidates from underrepresented
groups. We invite participation from everyone in the HPC community, to help
us gather knowledge from across the HPC workforce and provide clear
guidance for steps to recruitment success. To attend, register
