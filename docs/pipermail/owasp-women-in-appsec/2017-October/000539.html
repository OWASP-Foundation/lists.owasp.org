<PRE>Dear Zoe and WIA Members,

This is a reminder that we need to know what events you wish to host at
AppSec Europe Next year and need to know how you want to structure your
sponsorship levels.  A final draft is  required by October 26th.

Once you know what events you have bandwidth for, I think the previous
sponsorship doc will be a pretty decent pattern.  In the past tying in with
a local group for an evening event and hosting a luncheon event have been
wildly successful.  In Tel Aviv She Codes would be a natural tie as they
have already done activities with the local chapter.  I also know that the
team in Israel is really excited to work with you and include you.  I also
hope that we will have more women at this event due to the higher numbers
in the host nation.

It is important that we know both what you plan to do and that you have
staff to run the events. You can see more about the event here:

Let me know if I can do anything to help you out.

Best,

Tiffany Long
