<PRE>Hello WIA Committee,

We're contemplating adopting roles to give some structure to the WIA
Committee and allow folks to take responsibility for certain aspects of the
committee.

To that end, I'm looking for feedback on the following roles, and if you
agree, also let me know if you want yourself considered for one or more
roles.  We could make it so each role has two or three people fill it,
which would spread out the work load and avoids gaps when people are
unavailable (e.g. two Secretaries, three Treasurers, etc).  Or we can have
a structureless committee that decides by consensus, or adopt a
dictatorship model (just checking if you're reading).  Here are the roles,
the thought is they'd be by calendar year and in December we decide on who
is filling the next year's roles.


Chair - runs meetings, keeps meetings on track, fosters dialog, etc.

Vice-Chair (or co-Chair?) - backup for Chair

Secretary - schedules meetings and agendas, take attendance, captures
meeting minutes, captures decisions, is responsible for the paperwork
required by Committee 2.0 model, maintains voting member list, etc.

Treasurer - tracks funds, prepares budgets, handles donations and
sponsorships, etc.

Volunteer Coordinator - recruits and organizes volunteers, tracks
participation, etc.

Special project leaders - responsible for a special project, such as
mentoring, special event training, etc.


Please note that the Committee 2.0 model requires that you be an OWASP
member in order to have a leadership position on the committee.  If you're
not an OWASP member, you can still participate and volunteer in one of the
areas mentioned above, but you'll be on a sub-committee (or alternatively,
you can join OWASP).

Looking forward to feedback on the above.

Thanks,

- Bil
