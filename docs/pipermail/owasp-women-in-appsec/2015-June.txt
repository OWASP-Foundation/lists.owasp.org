FYI: I wanted to share this with our group as an interesting model for a
scholarship program. I like the diversity approach to this program, too.

 I'm proud and pleased to introduce you to a unique sponsorship option from
O'Reilly. Created to amplify our efforts to increase diversity in tech?a
cause that we firmly believe will benefit *everyone* in the industry?our
new Diversity & Inclusion Scholarship Program offers you an opportunity to
join us in supporting that cause, in a very concrete, practical way.

Your sponsorship allows early-career technologists from underrepresented
groups to attend O'Reilly conferences, where they'll get invaluable
training, perspective, and industry connections that accelerate their
career trajectory. And it?s an opportunity for your company to take a
public stand as a serious supporter of equality and inclusion in the
technology industry.

The motto for this program is, "To create the best possible future, we need
everybody.? At O?Reilly, we believe that?s absolutely true. We're
committing to funding 10 scholarships for each of our US-based conferences.
Please join us. I look forward to partnering with you on this important
program.
