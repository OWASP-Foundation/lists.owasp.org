<PRE>Hello 

 

My initial thoughts/comments are:

 

General

AppSec has come a long way since the last conference sponsoring women in
that it is a much more established area of expertise.  I think that in
addition to encouraging women, we should hone in to get qualified
individuals to attend that will make an impact on the exploding number of
application breaches.  It is an advanced conference with few (or none)
glossy sessions so my thoughts are that we should focus on pulling in either
info sec women into app sec and/or application developers into app sec
(build side of OWASP's Build Break and Defend model).  

 

Add a GOAL

Establish Goal of Women in Security as it pertains to OWASP AppSec -
Increase Women in the field of Application Security

 

Enhance Objective - Award OWASP AppSec sponsorships to women candidates that
can make a difference as they embark on their careers and in organizations.

 

Eligibility comment

1.                   Was previously 'Is or has worked in information
technology and would like to explore a career in application security.&quot;

As suggested by Samantha, refinement to 'Is studying or has worked in
information systems security or application development and would like to
pursue a career in application security'.  We could have a statement
expressing flexibility or latitude by reviewers of candidates to ensure we
get enough candidate submissions.

2.                   'Each applicant must be a woman not already employed in
the field of application security who either'.  I think the point the
previous group was making was that sponsorship  should be for women who do
not have an opportunity for their companies to send them to the conference
(which is reasonable in my mind).  Is that what others on our committee
think as well?

 

Sponsorship

Devise and set exact amounts of each scholarship (Expenses and Conference
Fees but not to exceed $x)

Approach multiple organizations as needed - should give previous sponsors a
chance to sponsor.  

I know executives at financial institutions that we could approach if
needed.  

We want at least 2 sponsorships.  If we happen to get 3 sponsorships great.

 

Hope these thoughts and comments help.

Hello Women in Security organisers, 

 

I just wanted to reach out and get the conversation going again. I think
next step is to get the guidelines finalised so we can start delegating
tasks to the group. Can everyone please look at the document Helen created,
and add input. There are some questions for individual group members in the
comments section as well. 

 

@Monika: Please look at the criteria and add some input into your thoughts
on expanding the web app sec emphasis. 

 

@Lorna: Do you reckon you are able to locate the previous year's winners?
Let me know if you have their details and can reach out. 

 

I would like to get this finalised by next week so we can start moving
forward. Thank you all for your time, support, and dedication to this
initiative.

 

Speak soon, Team.

Hi Monika, Samantha, Valene and subscribers,

 

Thanks to Samantha to set up the list. I like Valene's idea of using the
2011 one as a starting point. I think Monika's idea of broadening the
criteria of the grant is very interesting.

 

I believe the organizer for Women in Security in 2011 could provide valuable
input. Do you happen to know who they are? Is there a women in security
agenda in AppSec USA 2012 or any other OWASP conferences?

 

Do you also happen to know the where about of Tara Wilson and Chandni
Bhowmik, the two women who have received the grant in 2011? It would be nice
if they can give a testimonial.

 

Sorry I arrived at the volunteers meeting too late. I look forward to
meeting Monika, Valene and others in the future.

 

Below is a copy of 2011 with my comments. What do you think? If prefer to
centralize our discussion using a Google doc then I can set one up.

 


Sponsor


To sponsor future events, please e-mail  &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">womeninappsec at owasp.org</A>&gt;
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">womeninappsec at owasp.org.</A> 

Helen: Is there any sponsor candidate? Should we approach Wells Fargo, the
one in 2011? What's our fundraising goal? Sponsoring 2 attendees like in
2011 with a cost of $4,000? If there is no sponsor, then can the foundation
absorb the cost?

I assume we will reuse the mailbox. Sarah just verified that she has access
to it.


About the Grant


The OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec Grant provides merit-based funding for
women to attend OWASP AppSec USA. Applicants must be employed in information
technology or studying in college and have an interest in application
security (but not already be employed in the field of application security).


Eligibility


Helen: Application security is a big field, but may not have sufficient
woman practitioners. I hope to get more input on the criteria before
changing application security to something like information security.

Each applicant must be a woman not already employed in the field of
application security who either

*	Is a part- or full-time student at an accredited four-year college
or university in the United States.
*	Is or has worked in information technology and would like to explore
a career in application security.


Application


Helen: Is October 15, 2013 (one month prior to the conference) a reasonable
deadline?

Applications and letters of reference by two distinct people (co-worker,
manager, or professor/instructor were acceptable sources) were due August
15, 2011. Applicants are notified regarding their application status.

Applicants are responsible for gathering and submitting all necessary
information. Applications are evaluated on the information supplied.
Incomplete applications are not evaluated. All information received is
considered confidential and is reviewed only by the OWASP Women in AppSec
Grant committee.


Selection of Recipients


The OWASP Women in AppSec Grant committee makes travel and lodging
arrangements and facilitates training and conference attendance for selected
individuals.


Obligations


Recipients have no obligation to the OWASP Foundation.


Revisions


OWASP reserves the right to review the conditions and procedures of this
grant program and to make changes at any time including termination of the
program.
