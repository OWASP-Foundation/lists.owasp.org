<PRE>Hello All,

Hello All,

Just sending this copy over again for your review. This is what our
sponsorship document will contain, and we will use this to reach out to
potential sponsors for support of the program.

Please read through it and make comments, or discuss any additions or
omission you may have.

Bev brought up a great point last week regarding valuation systems. Bev,
have you been able to find some of the formulas we can use?

Additionally, I would love to get a short summary from our previous
winners. Helen, can you lead this initiative?

I would like to get this copy finalised by early next week.

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November of
2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP&#8217;s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information
security and/or application development, to expand their skills and pursue
application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA
2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will
be the award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec Program was
successfully launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event hopes to
build on that trend and further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to the
AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page&lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/</A>&gt;
.

*Past Winners*

Should we add a section here with quotes from our past winners? What do you
all think?

*Additional Information*

If you have questions, or if you wish to contribute to the program, please
e-mail Samantha Groves at: <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">appsec_usa_women_in_security at lists.owasp.org</A>[image:
