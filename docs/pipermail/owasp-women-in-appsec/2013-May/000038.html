OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program****

** **

The OWASP Foundation supports and enhances programs to increase the
participation of women in the field of application security recognizing the
value to organizations and society. OWASP is seeking funding at this time
to sponsor women from North America to attend an OWASP AppSec USA 2013 training
course &lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/</A>&gt; and the OWASP AppSec USA
2013 conference
talks &lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/</A>&gt; to be held in New York City in
November of 2013.****

 ****

*Current Objective*****

 ****

OWASP&#8217;s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information security and/or application development, to expand their skills
and pursue application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NY
AppSec USA 2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training
sessions, will be the award for this year's winners. This has been
established as a success at the last NY AppSec conference, and this effort
aims to continue to build upon that trend. ****
