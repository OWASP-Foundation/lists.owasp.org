Hello Bev,

I've had a look at the article and it look great. I don't know if we currently have the data needed to get an accurate value of offerings at the present time. I feel we would be spending most of our time digging up this information to get the figure instead of spending our time getting the work done to get this program off the ground this year. What do the rest think? Let me know your thoughts on the matter.&#160;

Hello there, I have a few calls out, and plan to meet to discuss soon. Found this from googling, and it looks similar to what I've seen others do with their valuations:

I'm going to ask the Information Architecture Institute if we can share the template that we created for our partners. It breaks down some values of mailings, twitter, facebook, social media, etc. Would OWASP be interested in having the Information Architecture Institute as an association partner? I can help set that up, if they are. The IAI has an interesting partner program, in contrast to what OWASP is doing:&#160;<A HREF="http://iainstitute.org/en/about/partners.php">http://iainstitute.org/en/about/partners.php</A>

There are other possible association partners, as well, W3C, UxPA, etc. Let me know if you want me to help.

This looks good, thank you for the updates. Best wishes.

Bev

Hello All,

Hello All,

Just sending this copy over again for your review. This is what our sponsorship document will contain, and we will use this to reach out to potential sponsors for support of the program.&#160;

Please read through it and make comments, or discuss any additions or omission you may have.

Bev brought up a great point last week regarding valuation systems. Bev, have you been able to find some of the formulas we can use?&#160;

Additionally, I would love to get a short summary from our previous winners. Helen, can you lead this initiative?&#160;

I would like to get this copy finalised by early next week.&#160;

OWASP&#160;Women&#160;in&#160;Application Security (AppSec) Program

Seeking Sponsorship

The OWASP Foundation,&#160;in&#160;recognition of value to both organizations and society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the participation of&#160;women&#160;in&#160;the field of application security.&#160; As part of this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor&#160;women&#160;from North America to attend &#160;OWASP&#160;AppSec&#160;USA&#160;to be held&#160;in&#160;New York City&#160;in November&#160;of 2013.

Objectives

OWASP&#8217;s current program objective is to encourage female students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career&#160;in&#160;information security&#160;and/or application development, to expand their skills and pursue application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will be the award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec Program was successfully launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event hopes to build on that trend and further engage women in the community.

Sponsorship Needs

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek sponsors for this program. &#160;Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at least two attendees:&#160;

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and accommodation.

-&#160; $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and accommodation.

Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive?&#160;

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to the AppSec USA website&#160;in&#160;the&#160;Sponsors Page.&#160;
Past Winners

Should we add a section here with quotes from our past winners?&#160;What do you all think?

Additional Information

If you have questions, or if you wish to contribute to the program, please e-mail Samantha Groves at:&#160;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">appsec_usa_women_in_security at lists.owasp.org</A>
