<PRE>Hello Team,

Everyone please have a look at the copy below. It is what we will be
placing on the appsec usa website if everyone is in agreement. Please let
me know if you have any amendments by the end of day Wednesday so we can
forward this to the web team.

I have made a few adjustments based on the numbers we need for sponsorship.
Please review, and let me know if you are happy with the copy.
Additionally, to Bev's point, should we amend the criteria to include women
not currently pursuing a degree?

Have a great evening, All.

OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program****

The OWASP Foundation supports and enhances programs to increase the
participation of women in the field of application security recognizing the
value to organizations and society. OWASP is seeking funding at this time
to sponsor women from North America to attend an OWASP AppSec USA 2013 training
course &lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/</A>&gt; and the OWASP AppSec USA
2013 conference
talks &lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/</A>&gt; to be held in New York City in
November of 2013.****

** **

*Current Objective*

** **

OWASP&#8217;s current program goal is to encourage female students at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information security and/or application development, to expand their skills
and pursue application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NY
AppSec USA 2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training
sessions, will be the award for this year's winners. This has been
established as a success at the last NY AppSec conference, and this effort
aims to continue to build upon that trend. ****
About the Current Program****

The OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec program provides merit-based funding
for women to attend OWASP AppSec USA 2013 in New York.****

** Each applicant must be a woman that meets our eligibility criteria below:

** **

**&#183;       **Is a part- or full-time student at an accredited four-year
college or university or graduate program in North America.****

**&#183;       **Is involved in an information technology degree and/or
professional information systems position.****

**&#183;       **Has an interest in pursuing application security in an
information security and/or application development role.****

** **

*Sponsorship Opportunities*****

sponsors for this program.  At a minimum, our goals are to raise funds to
cover for two attendees:****

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

-  **$3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
