<PRE>Hello All,

I just want to share the budget breakdown with all of you so we can all be
on the same page. Below is the information Sarah has provided to me
regarding costs of tickets and training.

Here are the costs for women in AppSec Sponsorship (but the total amount
&quot;needed&quot; is relative to what you all decide you want to offer)

- 2 days training (cover 40% of 1500, which is the trainer portion) = $600
- 1 ticket to appsecusa = $400 is &quot;cost&quot; for the ticket
- Travel, I think $2000 maximium was discussed for flight and hotel and misc

This brings it to $3000/person

Essentially this means that the total amount we need is $3,000 for each
winner. Since we are hoping to have 2 winners, we are aiming for $6,000
total in sponsorship money.

Now, if we manage to get local winners, we will only need $1300 for each
winner. That is $2600 for both to cover their local expenses, conference
ticket, and training.

I just wanted to clarify these figures for everyone. I will amend the
website blurb, and re-send for approval.

Thank you, Team.

Sam G.
