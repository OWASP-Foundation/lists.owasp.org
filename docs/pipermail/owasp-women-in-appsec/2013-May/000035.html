Decision Required by EOD Wednesday

 


Hello Team, 


 


Everyone please have a look at the copy below. It is what we will be placing
on the appsec usa website if everyone is in agreement. Please let me know if
you have any amendments by the end of day Wednesday so we can forward this
to the web team. 


 


I have made a few adjustments based on the numbers we need for sponsorship.
Please review, and let me know if you are happy with the copy. Additionally,
to Bev's point, should we amend the criteria to include women not currently
pursuing a degree? 


 


Have a great evening, All.

OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program


 

The OWASP Foundation supports and enhances programs to increase the
participation of women in the field of application security recognizing the
value to organizations and society. OWASP is seeking funding at this time to
sponsor women from North America to attend an OWASP AppSec USA 2013
&lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/</A>&gt; training course and the OWASP AppSec
USA 2013  &lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/</A>&gt; conference talks to be held in
New York City in November of 2013.

 

Current Objective

 

OWASP's current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information security and/or application development, to expand their skills
and pursue application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NY
AppSec USA 2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training
sessions, will be the award for this year's winners. This has been
established as a success at the last NY AppSec conference, and this effort
aims to continue to build upon that trend. 


About the Current Program


 

The OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec program provides merit-based funding
for women to attend OWASP AppSec USA 2013 in New York.

 Each applicant must be a woman that meets our eligibility criteria below:

 

.      Is a part- or full-time student at an accredited four-year college or
university or graduate program.

.      Or is involved in information security and/or application development
in a professional role.

.       Has an interest in exploring application security in an information
security and/or application development role.

 

Sponsorship Opportunities


The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  At a minimum, our goals are to raise funds to
cover for two attendees:

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation. 

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation. 

 

Organizations interested in participating in this initiative as a sponsor,
please contact Samantha Groves at
