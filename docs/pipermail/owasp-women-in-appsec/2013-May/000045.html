<PRE>Hello Women in AppSec Team,

I just wanted to reach out and get the ball rolling again with our
initiatives and plans. We now have the Women in AppSec blurb up on the
AppSec USA 2013 website:
<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-women-in-application-security-appsec-program/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-women-in-application-security-appsec-program/</A>

Thank you so much for everyone who pitched in.

Now, we should think about moving forward with putting together the copy
for the Sponsors Document. This is the document we will be sending to
potential sponsors for the program. I have put together a quick draft what
what I feel we can send over to potential sponsors. Please have a read
below, and add in any comments, suggestions, omissions, changes, etc.
-----------------------------------------

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November
of 2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP&#8217;s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information security and/or application development, to expand their skills
and pursue application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC
AppSec USA 2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training
sessions, will be the award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec
Program was successfully launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event
hopes to build on that trend and further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

 - $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to the
AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page&lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/</A>&gt;
.

*Past Winners*

Should we add a section here with quotes from our past winners? What do you
all think?

*Additional Information*

If you have questions, or if you wish to contribute to the program, please
e-mail Samantha Groves at: <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">appsec_usa_women_in_security at lists.owasp.org</A>

Thank you for your continued contribution to this initiative, Team.
