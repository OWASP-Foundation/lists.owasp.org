<PRE>Hello all,

 

Thanks to Samantha and all for the meeting on Friday in which I thought we
made a lot of progress.  It was helpful for me to understand how the OWASP
ticket allocation and money raised could work.   

 

As we discussed, here is a draft of the Introductory first web page to
present regarding our initiative.  It focuses in on the program and
sponsorship versus the participant details at this time.  It can be updated
as we make progress with funding and perhaps as a result of feedback from
potential sponsors.

 

Thanks, 

Valene

Subject: Draft Criteria

 


OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program 


The OWASP Foundation supports and enhances programs to increase the
participation of women in the field of application security recognizing the
value to organizations and society.  OWASP is seeking funding at this time
to sponsor women from North America to attend an OWASP AppSec USA 2013
&lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/</A>&gt; training course and the OWASP AppSec
USA 2013  &lt;<A HREF="http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/">http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/</A>&gt; conference talks to be held in
New York City in November of 2013. 

 

Current Objective

 

OWASP's current program goal is to encourage female students at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information security and/or application development to expand their skills
and pursue application security.  Attendance for two women at OWASP NY
AppSec USA 2013, an advanced application security conference, and at least
one of the in-depth training sessions, has been established as a success at
the last NY AppSec conference and this effort aims to continue and build
upon that trend.  


About the Current Program


 

The OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec program provides merit-based funding
for women to attend OWASP AppSec USA 2013 in New York. 

 

Each applicant must be a woman that meets our eligibility criteria below: 

 

.       Is a part- or full-time student at an accredited four-year college

information systems position.

.       Have an interest in pursuing application security in an information

Sponsorship Opportunities 


The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  At a minimum, our goals are to raise funds to
cover for two attendees: 

.       $2,400 for recipient from outside the area for travel and lodging
and/or
