Hello All,

I am just sending this copy for you to review once again. Not much has
changed other than the addition of the blurb from Tara. Thank you Lorna for
reaching out to the previous winners for this. Below is the draft. Please
make any comments, additions, needed.

Can we call this copy finalised even without the other winner's blurb? What
do you all think? Have a read and let me know. I would like to start
pushing this out to potential sponsors asap.

Thank you, Team.

-----------------------------------

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November of
2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP?s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information
security and/or application development, to expand their skills and pursue
application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA
2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will
be the award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec Program was
successfully launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event hopes to
build on that trend and further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to the
AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page<http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/>
.

*Past Winners*

Being fortunate enough to receive the Women in AppSec grant is a unique and
valuable experience. It is a great opportunity for women to have a chance
to bolster their skills and dive deep into the world of application
security. I found that attending the conference was not only a great way to
experience what the OWASP community has to offer, but it also gives
students a chance to network with a great group of people who are
passionate about their field and willing to share a wealth of information.
~ Tara Wilson, 2011 Winner

*Additional Information*

If you have questions, or if you wish to contribute to the program, please
e-mail Samantha Groves at: appsec_usa_women_in_security at lists.owasp.org[image:

Aloha,

Could I get more information about how to sign up for this program?  I am
currently working on my BS in IT Systems Security and I spend sleepless
nights researching all aspects of Information Security.

I am really into pentesting and very passionate about Cybersecurity.  I'm
currently working on a project for the Pacific Rim Cyber Security Institute.

Hope to hear back soon!

Hi Samantha,

I like a lot, but are we limiting the candidates to students? I think women
in the workforce also need, if not more, encouragement. Sorry not noticing
this earlier.

We could open it to North American Women in the workforce already as well;
however, do you think the selection process will be complicated by this?
What are your thoughts on the criteria for women already in the workforce.
Do they need to be working in software security already, or just be
interested in software security?

Hi Samantha, Helen, and Women in Appsec,

Perhaps professionals working in, and others interested, as well as
students, instructors, most inclusive sounds good, doesn't it?

Best wishes,
Bev

Hello All,

Here is the copy with the addition from Bev and Helen. I would like to get
this to the designer this week. Please review and confirm your acceptance
of the copy so we can move forward.

Thank you, Team.

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November of
2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP?s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels and professional working women who
are dedicated to a career in information security and/or application
development, to expand their skills and pursue application security.
Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013 conference, and
at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will be the award for this
year's winners. The Women in AppSec Program was successfully launched
at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event hopes to build on that trend and
further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to
the AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page<http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/>
.

*Past Winners*

Being fortunate enough to receive the Women in AppSec grant is a unique and
valuable experience. It is a great opportunity for women to have a chance
to bolster their skills and dive deep into the world of application
security. I found that attending the conference was not only a great way to
experience what the OWASP community has to offer, but it also gives
students a chance to network with a great group of people who are
passionate about their field and willing to share a wealth of information.
~ Tara Wilson, 2011 Winner

Hi Samantha,

I saw you added professionals. Is it possible to include also instructors

academia.

Please feel free to call me any time to discuss. 516 519 9210.

Regards,

Helen

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November of
2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP?s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels, instructors, and professional
working women who are dedicated to a career in information security and/or
application development, to expand their skills and pursue application
security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013
conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will be the
award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec Program was successfully
launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event hopes to build on that
trend and further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to
the AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page<http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/>
.

*Past Winners*

Being fortunate enough to receive the Women in AppSec grant is a unique and
valuable experience. It is a great opportunity for women to have a chance
to bolster their skills and dive deep into the world of application
security. I found that attending the conference was not only a great way to
experience what the OWASP community has to offer, but it also gives
students a chance to network with a great group of people who are
passionate about their field and willing to share a wealth of information.
~ Tara Wilson, 2011 Winner

Message-ID: <CAHFhp-7=XZXzyqVjP3erRbdoOZVpbLSwKUL=Ff5f06buxsErug@mail.gmail.com>

To whom it may concern,

Hi, I'm a security researcher work in a Singapore security company. I'm
interested in this field since my undergraduate period.

I'm wondering whether I can attend the program (I'm not from North America)
and if I can, how to attend?

Thank you!

Checking one last time, All. Are we all good with the latest copy for the
Sponsorship document? I am waiting until 1pm MST, and then I am sending it
to the designer. Speak up now if you would like to see edits.

Thank you, Team.

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November of
2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP?s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels, instructors, and professional
working women who are dedicated to a career in information security and/or
application development, to expand their skills and pursue application
security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013
conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will be the
award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec Program was successfully
launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event hopes to build on that
trend and further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to
the AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page<http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/>
.

*Past Winners*

Being fortunate enough to receive the Women in AppSec grant is a unique and
valuable experience. It is a great opportunity for women to have a chance
to bolster their skills and dive deep into the world of application
security. I found that attending the conference was not only a great way to
experience what the OWASP community has to offer, but it also gives
students a chance to network with a great group of people who are
passionate about their field and willing to share a wealth of information.
~ Tara Wilson, 2011 Winner

Dear Samantha, and others,

I think that it looks great. Although, I have a few other comments, too,
related to Women in Application Security:

1. Do you think that we should do some kind of survey of the OWASP
organization members to find out ways that we can improve the scholarship
program? For example, perhaps we need to create programs for Veterans
(women and men) and also a program for Men in Application Security, as
well?  The costs for attending AppSec are very high, and application
security training, in general, is much higher than many other fields. There
are likely many underserved, and qualified Veterans (men and women), and
men who have high potential, as well, whom we could try to help with
scholarships, etc. Wouldn't it be nice if we could provide scholarships for
anyone interested in the programs by offering additional scholarship
programs? I'm interested in surveying interest, and having the
conversation, in order to meet the needs of all of our members, and
potential members. Your thoughts?

2. Do you know of any others, especially OWASP men who might be interested
in serving on our program committee?  I asked friends to review our web
page, and one commented that we only have women serving on the current
committee, and that it would be nice if we had supportive OWASP men on the
committee, too. What do you think?

Best wishes,
Bev

Hello Bev,

Thank you for your comments. Please see my responses inline in blue below.


1. Do you think that we should do some kind of survey of the OWASP
organization members to find out ways that we can improve the scholarship
program? For example, perhaps we need to create programs for Veterans
(women and men) and also a program for Men in Application Security, as
well?  The costs for attending AppSec are very high, and application
security training, in general, is much higher than many other fields. There
are likely many underserved, and qualified Veterans (men and women), and
men who have high potential, as well, whom we could try to help with
scholarships, etc. Wouldn't it be nice if we could provide scholarships for
anyone interested in the programs by offering additional scholarship
programs? I'm interested in surveying interest, and having the
conversation, in order to meet the needs of all of our members, and
potential members. Your thoughts?

I think this is an excellent idea; however, I don't believe we will be able
to do this for the 2013 AppSec USA. It is certainly something we should do
for 2014. At this point, we really need to start raising the funding needed
for our Women in AppSec Program. We need to focus on getting this sorted as
soon as possible, as we have not raised any funding as of yet. Bev, were
you able to get in touch with Dana? Let us know.

2. Do you know of any others, especially OWASP men who might be interested
in serving on our program committee?  I asked friends to review our web
page, and one commented that we only have women serving on the current
committee, and that it would be nice if we had supportive OWASP men on the
committee, too. What do you think?

That would be great. They are all welcome. Just send us their e-mails and
we will add them to the list. We need more people looking for sponsorship
for the program, and could use more hands.

This all sounds good. I look forward to developing additional programs in
2014.

Yes,  sent an email to her requesting a good time to schedule a telephone
call, but have not yet received a response. I will reach out to her again
this week by email and telephone. Thank you.

They are all welcome. Just send us their e-mails and we will add them to

Excellent, I'd recommend that we pro-actively invite some members. I
nominate Tom Brennan and Jim Manico. Could we invite them?

Best wishes,
Bev

Just an afterthought, we might want to add on our webpage, and other
documents that this is the first in "more to come" scholarship programs,
and that anyone is welcome to join the committee, sort of an open
invitation? Best wishes, Bev

Yes,  sent an email to her requesting a good time to schedule a telephone
call, but have not yet received a response. I will reach out to her again
this week by email and telephone. Thank you.

Fantastic! Let us know if you require more assistance here.

Excellent, I'd recommend that we pro-actively invite some members. I
nominate Tom Brennan and Jim Manico. Could we invite them?

You are free to invite anyone you like to participate in our programs.

All the best, Bev.

Hello Team,

Attached is the Women in AppSec Sponsorship Document. This is the document
we should use to reach out to potential sponsors for our program.

I would like to call a meeting between us all this week so we can start
moving forward with raising funds for this opportunity.

Please do let me know if you are able to meet for a quick chat on Friday,
June 14 at 1pm MST. Let me know so we can schedule our call.

Thank you, Team.

Hi Samantha,

I think a call is a very good idea. But I may not be able to join if there
is an urgent business meeting at that time. I am usually available during
lunch hour, 12 - 1 PM EST.

Regards,

We should start up a list, and post who is the contact for each
organisation we are reaching out to. Bev, would you mind putting together
our list, and getting the ball rolling on this. Thank you so much for your
help. The more help we can get on this, the better. :)

Message-ID: <CA+EttN8XDo6VNcig5uywoB7z0qJ8k6Gba=OnBF3kVE_JHdvkgg@mail.gmail.com>

Thank you all for joining today's meeting.

Here are some of the items we discussed with Action items towards the end.

Discussion & Action Items

- Sponsorship Document<https://www.owasp.org/images/e/ed/Women-in-appsec-sponsorship.pdf>
 ? Looks great! Let's start sending this out to our sponsorship Leads

- Application Form<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WEtInvzlxLDXpTgfXh-E1E7e8H5FRfEOPIaTOizlBpk/viewform>
 ? Helen kindly put this together for us. Please review and comment for
discussion.

- Development of Selection Criteria
 ? We decided to hold off on this until we have funds available to move
forward with.

- Sponsorship Lead Document
 ? Bev will be putting together a google document for all of us to share.
This will be used to add our sponsorship leads and contact details along
with the name of the team member that is reaching out to them so there is
no overlap.

- Reaching out to Chapters
 ? We discussed the possibility of reaching out to Chapters to donate what
they can to the program. Sam will speak to Alison to manage logistics of
how Chapters could transfer funds.

- What if we are not able to raise enough funds?
 ? We discussed this possibility as well. Helen came up with a great idea.
We would like to discuss the possibility of getting 2 free conference
passes anyway, and choosing winners from the New York city area only, if we
are not able to raise the $6,000. Sam will reach out to Sarah to discuss
this option.

- Internal Sponsorship Opportunities
 ? Sam will reach out to our group and discuss the option of having their
organisations sponsor the program.

Next Steps

- Let's start reaching out to potential organisations. Send out the
document, and ask away.

Thank you all of your hard work on this.

Cheers now, All.

Subject: [Appsec_usa_women_in_security] Letter to Chapters
Message-ID: <CA+EttN8_1JnCM8SaeeEMKkCNm=SO3FLVELing3=uzGOcLTceYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Here is my draft of the letter I would like to send to chapters. Let me
know what you think.
---------------------------------

Hello OWASP X Chapter Members,

I just wanted to reach out and introduce myself. My name is Samantha
Groves, and I am the Projects Manager here at OWASP. This year, I am
helping organise the Women in AppSec
Program<http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-women-in-application-security-appsec-program/>for
AppSec USA this year taking place in New York City.

The program objective is to encourage female students at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels, instructors, and professional
workingwomen who are dedicated to a career in information security and/or
application development, to expand their skills and pursue application
security.

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program, and this is why I am reaching out to you today.
We are seeking $6,000 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation for 2 participants, and I was wondering if your Chapter had
any funds available to help sponsor this program. There is no minimum
amount required to help fund the initiatives as any little bit helps us get
closer to our program goals.

If you are interested in sponsoring this initiative, please do reach out to
me and let me know of your interest.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sam G.

Dear Samantha,

Instead of saying this: "if you have the funds available to..." I would
recommend considering a different approach. Something more like: If your
chapter is interested in taking a leadership role in launching this
trailblazing sponsorship opportunity, etc. But all in all, I think that you
did a beautiful job! I am in Boulder CO this week, so will not be online as
much, although I will plan to check in every day, morning / evenings. I
will not be able to attend the Tuesday meeting this week. I'll catch up
next week. Best wishes.

Sincerely,
Bev

Message-ID: <18B8F2010B91E144BC6EB64508D710132CC2D6840E@EXCHANGE.uco.local>


Dear Committee,

First of all, thank you very much for your effort to bring up female workforce in AppSec.
I have been working in the same area in a university setting.
I am Grace Park,  an assistant professor in Computer Science at University of Central Oklahoma, primarily teaching university>
I have taught computer security with AppSec, have led a team called Female Warriors for Enterprise Security in my university through a small grant, and have published papers related to AppSec education and female inclusion in Security Area last two years. (Please refer to my web page below)

In the last meeting at OWASP OKC chapter, I heard about a scholarship from another member.
In order to further develop my skills, I would like to apply for the scholarship if it is open.

My questions are

1)      Is the scholarship available?

2)      Am I eligible for the scholarship?

3)      What is required to apply for the scholarship?

4)      Do you have a blog to communicate among the female members?

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Hi!

I saw the Women in AppSec section for the NY Conference and was interested
in applying. I would absolutely *LOVE* to attend this incredible seminar
(it would be my first). How would I go about doing so or are you still just
looking for sponsors?

Thanks!
Kathy

I think that is an excellent suggestion, Bev. I will add that in. It is far
more persuasive, I think.

Thank you, Bev.

Hello OWASP Chapter Leaders,

I just wanted to reach out and introduce myself. My name is Samantha
Groves, and I am the Projects Manager here at OWASP. This year, I am
helping organize the Women in AppSec
Program<http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-women-in-application-security-appsec-program/>
for
AppSec USA taking place in New York City.

The program objective is to encourage female students at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels, instructors, and professional working
women who are dedicated to a career in information security and/or
application development, to expand their skills and pursue application
security.

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program, and this is why I am reaching out to you today.
We are seeking $6,000 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation for 2 participants. If your chapter is interested in taking a
leadership role in launching this great sponsorship opportunity please get
in touch with me as soon as possible. There is no minimum amount required
to help fund the initiatives as any little bit helps us get closer to our
program goals.

If you are interested in sponsoring this initiative, please do reach out to
me and let me know of your interest.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I've made a few additions. Have a look and tell us what you think?
Thank you for putting this together, Helen.


The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security. As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from
North America to attend OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in
November of 2013.
**OBJECTIVES**
OWASP?s current program objective is to encourage female students at
both the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a
career in information security and/or application development, to
expand their skills and pursue application security. Attendance for two
women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013 conference, and at least one of
the in-depth training sessions, will be the award for this year?s
winners. The Women in AppSec Program was successfully launched at
AppSec USA in 2011 this year?s event hopes to build on that trend and
further engage women in the community.
Please use the form below to submit your application to us.
Additionally, please contact Samantha Groves at
Samantha.Groves at owasp.org if you have any questions about the program.




I've invited you to fill out the form Women in Application Security

Hello,


My name is Mah and I am a woman working in the area of IT security.

Today in one of the security seminars, I heard about the wonderful program
you are organizing to support participation of women in the field of
application security.

As I am a security professional who is involved in development of
application security, I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to
attend this summit through this program.



I am sending you this email to express my interest and find out how I can
apply. Should you need more information please let me know.



Best Regards,

Mah
