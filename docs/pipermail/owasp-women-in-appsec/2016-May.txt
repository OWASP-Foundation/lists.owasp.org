Hi there WIAs, FYI: WIA is currently meeting for AppSecUSA. I haven't heard
about any meetings for WIA @ AppSecEU, if you know of anything please let
me know. The next WIA @ AppSecUSA meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, June
1, 1 - 2 pm on Google Hangouts, organized by Emily Verwee, and on the OWASP
Calendar. We also have a face to face meeting scheduled in DC on Wednesday,
June 15, 4 - 6 pm at Charlie Palmer, if anyone is interested, as well. WIA
