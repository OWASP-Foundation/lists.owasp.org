Hi Bil,

I agree, it would be a good idea to introduce roles. Happy to be involved
in any of the roles.

Let me know what you would like me to do.

Hi all,

I agree with the model, and with the comments, in particular I feel
important to have back-up for each role both for temporary need to step
down, but also to be able to manage specific effort consuming activities
that can arise for events or other focused activities.

My additional 1c' is to think about geographical coverage of the roles in
particular for event, recruiting of new participants to the WIA group,
dissemination activities....

Considering my expertise and my geographical presence, I am ready to
help, leaving you the final choice and evaluation, in the following roles
presented in order of preferences:

1 - Volunteer Coordinator - recruits and organizes volunteers, tracks
participation, etc.

2 - Special project leaders - responsible for a special project, such as
mentoring, special event training, etc.

3 - Vice-Chair (or co-Chair?) - backup for Chair

thank you bye Loredana

Message-ID: <CACtAMnMt+pFuZiVftHwK5vLuHKOK6EyEMe4kMThVWE8aXTF+9g@mail.gmail.com>

As a follow up to our February call, below is the link to WIA Membership
list.  Please check to ensure you're on the list and that I have correct
information for you.  You can send any corrections directly to me.  Once we
elect a Secretary, I will hand off this spreadsheet to that officer to own
and maintain.

On the spreadsheet you will see the following:


   - Your name
   - Your chapter / location
   - If you're an OWASP member, the expiration date of your membership.
   Note that mine looks a little funky, it's because I'm a lifetime member so
   I picked a date far out into the future.
   - If you're an OWASP member, how many more days until your membership
   expires.  If you let your OWASP membership lapse and are a Voting Member,
   you will lose your Voting Member status.  Please renew your OWASP
   membership early.
   - WIA Membership type (Voting or Participating).  I'll explain them in
   more detail below.
   - WIA Joined - this is when Voting Members joined the WIA committee
   formally as a voting member.
   - WIA Renewed - Voting Members must "renew" their interest in being on
   the committee every six months.  This is when they last did it.
   - WIA Next Renewed - This is when Voting Member must next "renew" their
   interest of being on the committee.  An email will be sent, unless you
   reply "yes" you will be dropped as a Voting Member (i.e. reply "no" or
   don't reply at all).
   - Meeting Attendance - if there's a "1" it means you attended the
   meeting.  Please ensure I have your attendance correctly, as we'll track
   this for participation, which is used to ensure Voting Members are meeting
   their obligations, and used for Participating Members if they want to
   become Voting Members.  Note that this is NOT the only measurement we will
   use, we will likely use other metrics, such as participation on the WIA
   list, participation on special projects, etc.  Once decided, we'll probably
   track those as well.


To elaborate on the membership types, there are two types of members:


   - Voting - these members can serve in leadership positions of the
   committee, can vote, and have participation obligations.  If you are listed
   as "Voting" it means you are a voting member of the WIA Committee.  Only
   valid OWASP Members are eligible to be voting members.  If you wish to
   become a Voting Member, you must be a valid OWASP member, you must
   participate for three months in WIA Committee, and then the Voting Members
   vote to add you as a Voting Member (majority vote carries).
   - Participating - these members can serve and lead sub-committees,
   participate on the list, at meetings, and most everything else except be a
   Committee Leader and vote.


Here is the WIA Membership list:

Hello WIA Committee,

As per the Committee 2.0 rules, I have two participating members that would
like to become voting members.  I have verified their eligibility and am
now calling for a vote.

The two participating members are:

     Cathy Hall
     Wendy Istvanick

We have 9 Voting Members, which means I need 5 "Yes" votes to add them as
Voting Members.  Please reply to this message with your vote of "Yes" or
"No".

Keep in mind, only Voting Members may vote.  You can check your membership
status here:

Is there a reason votes are public? Would prefer private voting.

Hi Bev,

It's required by the OWASP Committees 2.0 Operational Model (
https://owasp.org/index.php/Governance/OWASP_Committees).  Specifically, it
says:

    "The committee will then conduct a vote on the applicant, via the same
medium"

with "medium" being the email list.

Interestingly, it doesn't appear to require votes be public for any other
decisions, just those related to adding new Voting Members.  It does
require discussion be public and archived publicly, but is silent on
decisions that are made.  I would think for transparency, we'd want all
votes public anyway though.

We have five votes "Yes", which means Cathy Hall and Wendy Istvanick are
now Voting Members of the WIA Committee.  I've updated the WIA Membership
list to reflect their new status.

Votes for "Yes" - Bev Corwin, Emily Verwee, Owen Pendlebury, Wendy Zenone,
Bil Corry
Votes for "No" - None

This brings our total Voting Members to 11.

For those that are Voting Members, you have a few days left to nominate
yourself for a 2017 Leadership role in WIA (you have until Feb 28).  We'll
have to figure out how to do the actual vote in March, my thought is we'll
hold the voting off-list, and announce the results on-list.

Here is the current election ballot:

Chair:
Emily Verwee
Owen Pendlebury

Vice/Co-Chair:
Owen Pendlebury
Loredana Mancini
Cathy Hall

Secretary:
Owen Pendlebury
Cathy Hall

Treasurer:
Owen Pendlebury
Cathy Hall

Volunteer Coordinator:
Wendy Istvanick
Owen Pendlebury
Loredana Mancini
