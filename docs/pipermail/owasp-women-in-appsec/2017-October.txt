Welcome to the WHPC October Newsletter! Below you can find out about all of
our activities this November during the week of SC17. This is the largest
set of activities that we have ever put on during one week, and we have
tried to provide something for everyone. We hope you can join us in
November.
There is still time to take advantage of the SC17 early bird discount, but
make sure you register by 15th October to take advantage of this. For many
of our activities during SC week you will need some form of SC
registration, which is handled by the conference, not by WHPC. To find out
what you need, check out our quick registration guide
<https://womeninhpc.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=007abbb94048819c6eb6815c9&id=09b347ef58&e=48ec218961>

  We Need Your Help!

During the week of SC17 we will have a special ?Women in HPC? awareness day
on Tuesday, 14th November. We are seeking volunteers ? men and women are
both welcome ? to be ambassadors for Women in HPC, wear a WHPC & Diversity
T-shirt, and spread the word about the importance and benefits of diversity.
To be a WHPC ambassador you don?t have to be an expert in diversity. We
will provide a cheat sheet of key diversity facts and additional guidance
on how to get people engaged in the topic.
Sign Up to Be a WHPC Ambassador

7th International WHPC Workshop: Diversifying the HPC Community

The Seventh International WHPC workshop is a full day event, bringing
together women and their allies and advocates from across the HPC
community. This workshop will focus on supporting two key groups: women and
their employers. The morning session will provide a discussion on the
skills needed to thrive in an HPC career.

We particularly encourage early- and mid-career women to attend, but we
welcome all, including men, to participate and contribute to this session.
The afternoon will be dedicated to identifying how employers, managers, and
hirers can make the workplace a more inclusive environment, identifying and
overcoming the roadblocks that face women and other underrepresented groups
in the workplace. To attend please make sure you register for an SC17
workshop pass

for an evening of food and cocktails and the opportunity to meet employers
who are keen to diversify their workforce. Our evening and lunch events
have a reputation for being unlike any other HPC party you will attend,
with a supportive and exciting networking atmosphere.

Come and meet our sponsors, including our anchor supporter Intel, to find
out about working with them. Build your network by meeting women in HPC and
their advocates. Space for this event is limited, so please ensure that you
register early. This event is only made possible through the support of

BoF ? Women in HPC: Non-Traditional Paths to HPC and How They Can and Do
Enrich the Field Wednesday, 15th November, 12:15 pm ? 1:15 pm

In this BoF we examine how to broaden the community?s perceptions to access
a more diverse talent pool. We will hear from three women who came to HPC
from non-standard directions, followed by discussion with audience
participation on how to recruit from non-traditional backgrounds and
broaden the HPC talent pool. To attend, register

for an SC17 Exhibits or Technical Program pass.

BoF ? Recruitment: How to Build Diverse Teams Thursday, 16th November,
12:15 pm ? 1:15 pm

Diverse teams are now generally accepted as a ?good idea.? That said, a
common refrain during discussions on improving diversity focuses on the
lack of women applying for jobs. This session will address improving
recruitment practices to reach more candidates from underrepresented
groups. We invite participation from everyone in the HPC community, to help
us gather knowledge from across the HPC workforce and provide clear
guidance for steps to recruitment success. To attend, register

Want to Blog for WHPC?

The WHPC blog shares the science and experiences of women. Our aim is to
showcase the work that women do, both to inspire the next generation of
women HPC experts, as well as to provide women with a platform to discuss
their science. We also share articles and discussion items that are
beneficial for improving diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
If you have some science to share, or want to discuss the work you are
doing to improve diversity, we want to hear from you. Get in touch to
discuss blogging about your work: Email us at: info at womeninhpc.org.

Subject: [Women_In_AppSec] Women in AppSec event for Appsec Europe 2018 Tel
	Aviv
Message-ID: <CAOYnQan7qQrBEb4L_rkAsf5uLkuEiW_sm7q-Fq-qh9bS_mnRzA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Zoe and WIA Members,

This is a reminder that we need to know what events you wish to host at
AppSec Europe Next year and need to know how you want to structure your
sponsorship levels.  A final draft is  required by October 26th.

Once you know what events you have bandwidth for, I think the previous
sponsorship doc will be a pretty decent pattern.  In the past tying in with
a local group for an evening event and hosting a luncheon event have been
wildly successful.  In Tel Aviv She Codes would be a natural tie as they
have already done activities with the local chapter.  I also know that the
team in Israel is really excited to work with you and include you.  I also
hope that we will have more women at this event due to the higher numbers
in the host nation.

It is important that we know both what you plan to do and that you have
staff to run the events. You can see more about the event here:
https://2018.appsec.eu/

Let me know if I can do anything to help you out.

Best,

Tiffany Long
Community Manager

*ICMCP?s Tech Summit Sponsored by Symantec to Feature Silicon Valley?s
Brightest Minds to Help Decode Cybersecurity Diversity Challenge*

The International Consortium of Minority Cybersecurity Professionals (ICMCP)
<https://icmcp.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=947870889fffe1385c6ee2dc6&id=ea04d53052&e=83408aff58>
today
announced that Symantec Corporation, the world?s leading cyber security
company, will sponsor the second annual ICMCP West Coast Summit
<https://icmcp.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=947870889fffe1385c6ee2dc6&id=eb7a2c3367&e=83408aff58>
on
minority underrepresentation in cybersecurity. The summit will be held on
November 2nd at the Symantec headquarters in Mountain View, CA from 12-6pm
PST.

The West Coast Summit will bring together technology and security leaders
in Silicon Valley. The summit extends the success of the second annual
ICMCP National Conference held in Washington, DC in March and the earlier
DC Town Hall meeting hosted by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson. It will
provide another opportunity to raise the dialogue on the necessary
strategic, tactical and operational imperatives needed to attract and
develop minority cybersecurity practitioners.

During the one-day summit, security thought leaders will hold a series of
expert panel and audience-driven discussions, and examine ways to further
the inclusion of underrepresented minorities in cybersecurity. Thought
leaders will participate in ?working sessions? that will be documented and
serve as a guide for ongoing efforts and future initiatives to continue the
conversation.

Cybersecurity has been identified as one of today?s most serious economic
and national security challenges. There is a glaring underrepresentation of
women and other historically marginalized minority groups, specifically
African Americans and Hispanics, in the fast-growing discipline. Despite
the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals, it remains an area
where there is a significant shortage of skilled practitioners. The ICMCP
scholarship awards, including voucher certification programs, were
established to promote the inclusion of underrepresented and untapped
minorities in the next generation of cybersecurity practitioners.

Dear OWASP Women in AppSec community members,

A reminder to those of you planning to attend the upcoming International Conference on Cyber Security (ICCS 2018) on January 8 at Fordham University at Lincoln Center in NYC:
https://www.meetup.com/owaspnyc/events/244201029/?_cookie-check=I-zz9KSoQGN33OHG

I encourage you to stop by the OWASP booth to chat. The conference should be a great opportunity for you to update with the local OWASP community as well as the WIA Committee. 

Look out for ongoing OWASP updates, and feel free to reach out. 

Best,
Zoe Braiterman
