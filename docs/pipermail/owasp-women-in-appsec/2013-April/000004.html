<PRE>Hi Monika, Samantha, Valene and subscribers,

Thanks to Samantha to set up the list. I like Valene's idea of using the
2011 one as a starting point. I think Monika's idea of broadening
the criteria of the grant is very interesting.

I believe the organizer for Women in Security in 2011 could provide
valuable input. Do you happen to know who they are? Is there a women in
security agenda in AppSec USA 2012 or any other OWASP conferences?

Do you also happen to know the where about of Tara Wilson and Chandni
Bhowmik, the two women who have received the grant in 2011? It would be
nice if they can give a testimonial.

Sorry I arrived at the volunteers meeting too late. I look forward to
meeting Monika, Valene and others in the future.

Below is a copy of 2011 with my comments. What do you think? If prefer to
centralize our discussion using a Google doc then I can set one up.

Sponsor

To sponsor future events, please e-mail <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">womeninappsec at owasp.org.</A>

Helen: Is there any sponsor candidate? Should we approach Wells Fargo, the
one in 2011? What's our fundraising goal? Sponsoring 2 attendees like in
2011 with a cost of $4,000? If there is no sponsor, then can the foundation
absorb the cost?

I assume we will reuse the mailbox. Sarah just verified that she has access
to it.
About the Grant

The OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec Grant provides merit-based funding for
women to attend OWASP AppSec USA. Applicants must be employed in
information technology or studying in college and have an interest in
application security (but not already be employed in the field of
application security).
Eligibility
Helen: Application security is a big field, but may not have sufficient
woman practitioners. I hope to get more input on the criteria before
changing application security to something like information security.

Each applicant must be a woman not already employed in the field of
application security who either

   - Is a part- or full-time student at an accredited four-year college or
   university in the United States.
   - Is or has worked in information technology and would like to explore a
   career in application security.

Application
Helen: Is October 15, 2013 (one month prior to the conference) a reasonable
deadline?

Applications and letters of reference by two distinct people (co-worker,
manager, or professor/instructor were acceptable sources) were due August
15, 2011. Applicants are notified regarding their application status.

Applicants are responsible for gathering and submitting all necessary
information. Applications are evaluated on the information supplied.
Incomplete applications are not evaluated. All information received is
considered confidential and is reviewed only by the OWASP Women in AppSec
Grant committee.
Selection of Recipients

The OWASP Women in AppSec Grant committee makes travel and lodging
arrangements and facilitates training and conference attendance for
selected individuals.
Obligations

Recipients have no obligation to the OWASP Foundation.
Revisions

OWASP reserves the right to review the conditions and procedures of this
grant program and to make changes at any time including termination of the
program.
