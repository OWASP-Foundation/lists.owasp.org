<PRE>Helen -
Please speak with Tom before inviting anyone... as he is coordinating
invited speakers (such as keynotes).  Also, I don't think Joan is speaking,
I think she is on the speaker selection committee...

Additionally, Bill and I had a call with someone at CSO magazine yesterday
about a media partnership and they have come back to us to say it won't
work because are event conflicts with other events they are already
involved with.  I don't think a sponsorship will be an option for them....

</I>&gt;<i> NYIT Hosts First Meeting of the Long Island Cyber Defense Consortium&lt;<A HREF="http://www.nyit.edu/about_nyit/news/nyit_hosts_first_meeting_of_the_long_island_cyber_defense_consortium/">http://www.nyit.edu/about_nyit/news/nyit_hosts_first_meeting_of_the_long_island_cyber_defense_consortium/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Old Westbury, N.Y. (Feb. 26, 2013)* - Yesterday, New York Institute of
</I>&gt;<i> Technology (NYIT) hosted a meeting initiated by Congressman Steve Israel
</I>&gt;<i> (D-Huntington) of what initially is being called the &#8220;Long Island Cyber
</I>&gt;<i> Defense Consortium&#8221; intended to position Long Island as a &#8220;center of
</I>&gt;<i> excellence&#8221; if not the cyber defense capital of America.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the meeting, it was recalled how Long Island became the defense
</I>&gt;<i> capital of America during World War II, and today, the region is in a
</I>&gt;<i> position to take the lead in defending America again, based on the
</I>&gt;<i> collective expertise and competence concentrated in the area through
</I>&gt;<i> institutions of higher education, private industry, the utilities sector,
</I>&gt;<i> government labs, and the leading players in technology and energy, among
</I>&gt;<i> others, many of whom attended the meeting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rep. Israel said, &#8220;I am extremely appreciative of New York Institute of
</I>&gt;<i> Technology&#8217;s willingness to host the first meeting of the Long Island Cyber
</I>&gt;<i> Defense Consortium. As one of Long Island&#8217;s premier educational
</I>&gt;<i> institutions, we are lucky to have such a priceless resource in our own
</I>&gt;<i> backyard. As this consortium moves forward, we anticipate NYIT playing a
</I>&gt;<i> pivotal role.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The initial goals of the group are to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Inventory the cyber defense capabilities of Long Island businesses
</I>&gt;<i>    and institutions.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Mobilize those capabilities and match them to the needs of federal
</I>&gt;<i>    cyber security entities and put Long Island at the forefront of protecting
</I>&gt;<i>    America against cyber attacks.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Seek federal support for the creation of a cyber security hub on
</I>&gt;<i>    Long Island.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Representing NYIT at the meeting were Peter C. Kinney III, Chief of
</I>&gt;<i> Staff; and Nada Marie Anid &lt;<A HREF="http://www.nyit.edu/experts/nada_anid/">http://www.nyit.edu/experts/nada_anid/</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> Ph.D., Dean, School of Engineering and Computing Sciences&lt;<A HREF="http://www.nyit.edu/engineering">http://www.nyit.edu/engineering</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;We are pleased to be part of a project that is so vital to the
</I>&gt;<i> competitiveness and safety of our nation,&#8221; Anid said. &#8220;Our faculty, who
</I>&gt;<i> have tremendous expertise to contribute to this important initiative, are
</I>&gt;<i> winning prestigious research grants in many areas relating to cyber
</I>&gt;<i> security, and we look forward to being an active and collaborative member
</I>&gt;<i> of the consortium.&#8221;
