Jim,

You can work out the specifics with Zoe & WIA but when you get ready to
move funds around, there's a OWASP Service Desk (OSD) for just for that:

Transfer Funds within OWASP
<https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/create/52> =>
This is a direct link to that form.

Just put you want to transfer $X from the Boston Chapter to the WIA and
we'll make sure the books are updated accordingly.

Cheers!

OK, great, thanks. We'll wait until after our local conference on Oct. 27
to see what funds we have then decide how much to transfer.  Zoe, we're
providing a free table to https://brainbabe.org/ at our conference (they
are local) , they will be helping with our resume room and the Brainbabe
founder Deidre Diamond will be one of the conference presenters.

Hello ladies and men colleagues : 

Thanks Zoe for the introduction and thanks Fateh for the earlier mention too.

As Fateh mentioned I am one of the managers of a quite large (130 members) LI group for women in cyber security in the Middle East. The group has women members mainly from Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and some other countries too. The group includes CISOs , security consultants, cyber security entrepreneurs , and young talent too still starting their careers many of whom specialize in application security and who I believe would be delighted to participate in OWASP local and global activities/initiatives 

If any of you ladies would like to join the group to announce OWASP women in appsec activities in the region or connect with many of the young ladies who specialize in application security please let me know ; or send a request to join; the group can be found from the below link:

Women in Cyber Security Middle East

Also, if you would like to sponsor or send any of the OWASP women in appsec from nearby countries to the women CTF that will take place in December at the Cairo security camp , please reach out to the camp organizer, Moataz Salah, CEO of cyber talents (copied) and the initiator of this women CTF. 

Looking forward to further collaboration. 

My best regards,

Abeer Khedr
Information security director
National Bank of Egypt

Hello Zoe and sorry for the delay.

I have discussed the topic with Abeer and I suggest that we schedule a
conference call to discuss together.
The idea that, there is no specific requirements related to the next event,
this is just an activity of the group led by Abeer and other main women
leaders in the middle-east Cybersecurity community.
What they are looking for is the "possible cooperation", you may introduce
the OWASP women in Appsec regular activities and see if we can host
something in the ME region. Other idea may be to announce about the CTF and
help bring women from Appsec to attend the CTF  [I'll forward to you an
email includes the details about the CTF].

Regards
Fateh

Hi Fateh and Abeer,

I propose a call for anyone interested on Monday, October 22 at around 12pm
(Eastern USA) for consistency purposes, given that we've held our monthly
OWASP WIA Committee meetings at that time for the past several months.

Do either of you, or anyone else included in this thread, have another time
they'd prefer to have the call?

Best,
Zoe

Hi all,

A reminder to check out the All Day DevOps schedule for the 24-hour

Best,
Zoe

Message-ID: <CAM=ttPJheLdFeFHSf-zL11PoB5pma1qQVp+xmA+384=jmGM+gQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP Women in AppSec,

I just had some great discussion with Keri and Pooja from Seattle and
Jasmine from Charlotte, and I?d like to use this as an opportunity to
remind you all to continue to exchange ideas about local and global OWASP /
WIA engagement / meetups, so we can contribute to build upon all of our
important AppSec OWASP collaborative contribution.

Looking forward to hearing more from all of you. Have a wonderful weekend!

Best,
Zoe
