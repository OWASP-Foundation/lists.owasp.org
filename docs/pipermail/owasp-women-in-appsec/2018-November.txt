Hi Fateh,

I have added in the email in too list (owasp-women-in-appsec at lists.owasp.org).
Please share the list with rest of the women you know.

I am in IST (Indian Standard Time) and Zoe in EST (Eastern Standard time).
You can schedule it around 8PM IST - 10PM IST :) If you have different time
in Mind I am fine with that also.

Message-ID: <CACxry_02YuiEv8-UpF9-yUy8Q8kmK2FhaA-0DVH8E7zFt0a7Ew@mail.gmail.com>

Ladies and Gents,

I'm looking for potential speakers in the area of Defense coding and
programming or related subjects. The target group is developers looking to
learn how to code securely.

Please contact me directly if you are interested to pass by Amsterdam and
give a talk.

Also for future planning and your availability.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Cheers
