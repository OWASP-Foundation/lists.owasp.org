<PRE>Hi Again Wendy, I just sent out a calendar invitation for Friday when you
return at 11am to noon. We'll try to do what we can then, hopefully, it is
a good time for most. I'd suggest to just save that weekly11am to noon
meeting time for any needed WIA Committee - AppSecUSA Planning Discussions
between now and AppSecUSA. Best wishes, Bev

&gt;<i> Hi Wendy, It sounds good. In the meeting Zoe Braiterman was elected as the
