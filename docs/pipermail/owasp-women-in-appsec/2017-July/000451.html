<PRE>Hi Tanya,

Regarding the Slack channel I think we can use the OWASP #WIA channel. I've
signed up and looks like there are people still connected and talking
there. But we need to let people know it exits, something I think we can
via the newsletter.

As for the newsletter, I would love to lead that part, I used to lead the
Spanish version of the Debian News Project. I think I can take over this.
If you like the idea, I can start working on our first one as well as a way
to get news, edit and publish them.

I don't have plans on attending AppSec USA as it is on the other side of
the globe, but any help with the website, give me a shout. :)

I think the newsletter and website are a great idea. We need to make us
notice, but most importantly let more women where and whom to contact if
they want to join us.

Thanks,
Kat

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As your chair, I have made some decisions that I think you should all be
</I>&gt;<i> aware of.  I am also looking for some volunteers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Decisions:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - There will be no mentoring lunch at AppSec USA, as there is no
</I>&gt;<i>    volunteer to lead it.  We will concentrate on the WIA Hang Out room
</I>&gt;<i>    instead.  We will be making it the coolest place at the conference to be.
</I>&gt;<i>    I&#8217;ve already got several speakers who have agreed to stop by.
</I>&gt;<i>    - There will be no &#8220;in person&#8221; meeting at AppSec USA for WIA.  We will
</I>&gt;<i>    have it online the week after.  As most of us will not be attending the
</I>&gt;<i>    event, they will miss out, and the people who are there need to &#8220;work&#8221; the
</I>&gt;<i>    WIA Hang Out room and also I want them to attend the conference and learn.
</I>&gt;<i>    We can accomplish much more with a virtual meeting the following week.
</I>&gt;<i>    - I don&#8217;t want us to have all of our conversations on the mailing list
</I>&gt;<i>    anymore, I want us to have a slack Channel.  I think Wendy created one for
</I>&gt;<i>    Bev and I before&#8230;.  I want us to have a slack channel and have our
</I>&gt;<i>    discussions are there from then on.  I will let you all know when it&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i>    ready.  The mailing list is when there is something big that we need to say
</I>&gt;<i>    to everyone.  I am looking for a volunteer to create and administer the
</I>&gt;<i>    slack channel, *please email me* if you are willing to take this on.
</I>&gt;<i>    - We are going start a monthly WIA News Letter, so that people who are
</I>&gt;<i>    interested but who do not want to be on the committee can still help us and
</I>&gt;<i>    see what we are up to.  I am looking for a volunteer to do this.  *Email
</I>&gt;<i>    me i*f you are interested.  We will list all of the WIA or
</I>&gt;<i>    WIA-friendly events in this, and anything else we think people might like
</I>&gt;<i>    to know, plus &#8220;homework&#8221; for people to do to help our cause in their own
</I>&gt;<i>    life.
</I>&gt;<i>    - I plan to push AppSec USA very hard to give free admittance to
</I>&gt;<i>    people who have filled the forms to volunteer for AppSec USA for WIA.
</I>&gt;<i>    Please list WIA in your application form.  If you already filled it and
</I>&gt;<i>    didn&#8217;t put that please give me your name so I know and I can talk to them.
</I>&gt;<i>    - *I do not plan to pay all-expense-trips to AppSec for anyone out of
</I>&gt;<i>    the WIA budget.*  If this was previously unclear, I apologize.  If you
</I>&gt;<i>    have other funding and are very close to being able to attend but not
</I>&gt;<i>    quite, we can talk.  Please email me directly about this if need be.  I can
</I>&gt;<i>    also give you ideas of how you can try to find funds for yourself via
</I>&gt;<i>    various means.
</I>&gt;<i>    - We are going to make a WIA website, which will let people sign up
</I>&gt;<i>    for the news letter, and see a link to our twitter feed.  We will expand it
</I>&gt;<i>    as need be, and we hope to have it ready before AppSec USA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Questions *I have for all of you (please *reply in emails directly to me*,
</I>&gt;<i> not the mailing list).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Who plans to attend AppSec USA this year?  I need to know who will
</I>&gt;<i>    be there to help run the WIA Room.
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Who wants to work on the News Letter?
</I>&gt;<i>    3. Who wants to work on the slack channel?
</I>&gt;<i>    4. Who needs help sorting out their volunteer forms?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tanya
</I>&gt;<i>
