<PRE>Hello everyone,

Bev, thank you for taking the lead on this! 

I love all the ideas.  I have two more to add (below).  However, can we actually do all of them?  Do we have a budget for this (and if so, do we want to spend such a large percentage on one event)?  Do we have enough resources (hours and people) to do all of these activities?  If we have to choose, how do we choose?  Is there precedent for any of these questions?  I LOVE AppSec, but I don&#8217;t want that to be the only place we spend our donation dollars and our volunteer hours.  Women who are attending AppSec are already interested in what we do (which is awesome!) but we also want to attract new women.  I just want to make sure this is not our only focus.  There are many, many places that we can make a huge difference, this is just one of them.

That said&#8230;. 

Two more possible activities for AppSec USA:
Reaching out to a local female tech/programming group to do a coordinated pre-conference event, like they did at AppSec EU.  That was my favourite WIA event to date.  And I bet we made a huge impression on those women, women who were outside of our industry, who may one day decide to join our industry, because of that event.  Because this would be outside of AppSec the deadline would not apply&#8230;.  We could very easily find them some kick-ass AppSec speakers.  I volunteer to coordinate this activity and even be the speaker if need be.  If someone wants to help me that&#8217;s cool too!  Especially if they are local and know people.  Cost for this should be $0, as the meetup would be expected to host&#8230;. Or we could ask the local OWASP Chapter to help with this.
Reach out to the local school and teach a mini security lesson to kids or high school. If we could find an all-girls school, this would be ideal.  Again, this was a great idea that the AppSec EU people came up with.   I also think that this probably did not have a large cost&#8230;.

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Ashley, Loredana and Wendy,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you! All of your comments are noted. OWASP Global says there is a hard stop date of April 11th. Anyone up for a gotomeeting session to finalize these concepts into a proposed plan? I'm available Friday (tomorrow) afternoon NYC time. Anyone else? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ashley, great concepts, would you be willing to take the lead on them and work out luncheon details with Bil until our July 11 meeting?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Loredana, Great idea, I'll ask if we could have a WIA table also in the expo and entrance areas, per your suggestion. Could you take the lead on this until our meeting on July 11?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wendy, could you prepare a plan for the panel and take the lead on that until our next meeting on July 11th?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ashley, Loredana and Wendy, Could you all write a brief description of your above mentioned concepts that you will lead, send them back to this list by July 7th (tomorrow), and we can add them to the below list for sending to OWASP Global before the July10th deadline? Also, let me know if anyone is available for a gotomeeting Sunday July 9th for a final discussion before July 10th deadline. Also kindly plan to attend and give updates at the July 11th meeting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bil, could you consult with Ashley on the WIA mentor luncheon concepts Item 1 and 2? Meanwhile, I'll work on item 3 and 4.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Updated items follow with assignments:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A WIA Mentors luncheon - capacity 50 - 70 attendees (invite local universities to participate Ashley and Bil taking lead)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. A room for WIAns and Mentors during the conference to spontaneously meet - capacity 20 - 30 (Have mentors scheduled to cover the room with their activities for &quot;drop ins&quot;. Ashley taking lead)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. A WIA keynote speaker or panelist on one of the regular tracks and//or panels - There are several women speaking at the conference already, invite them to WIA activities. (Bev will look into speakers and invite to WIA activities)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. A WIA Committee - Mentors Committee round table discussion meeting - capacity 50 - 60 (Bev taking lead)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. A WIA panel - This was originally rejected by OWASP Global Staff, however, I asked them to reconsider. I'd suggest focusing on the 1-4 for now and if we get the panel, be prepared for it. (Wendy taking lead)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to call or Skype if you wish to discuss details. Thank you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes,

</I>&gt;<i> These are all great ideas. I am trying to come up with others and so far don't have anything solid to add.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the panel discussion, my company, ThoughtWorks has worked very hard and been successful at hiring women to the extent of being named last year's winner of the Anita Borg Top Companies for Women Technologists. We are not security specialists, but if you want to round out the panel as you suggested, I am sure I could find someone who is willing to participate.

</I>&gt;<i> Great suggestions, Bev! I've done a lot of women in security panels and wanted to expand on your panel idea. Perhaps we could find companies that have decent representation (more than the industry average for security of 11% women or more than the industry average for IT of 20%) or are making good improvements and ask them targeted questions on how they did it. This would make a panel or talk more focused on actionable steps, instead of just discussing the problem we know exists already. I'd be happy to help find these companies or help with a panel/talk like this. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another idea is inviting 3-5 local colleges to have CS/CE/EE professors nominate a diverse student to give a 10/15-minute &quot;first conference talk&quot; where they discuss a project, security trend, or research initiative. We could provide mentors from our group to make sure they're successful, and it's a great resume builder. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just a few suggestions - happy to elaborate, will try to join the call on the 11th.
