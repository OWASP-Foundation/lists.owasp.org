<PRE>Here is an initial draft for the panel proposal.

 ----

It is well known that there are a disproportionately low number of women in IT and an even lower number who focus on security. Despite these low numbers, some organizations have been very successful in recruiting and retaining women.

What can we learn from these organizations to attract more women to security and other technical professions thereby increasing the number of women in our fields.

And in the meantime, can we use some of the proven techniques to make our own companies more attractive to and a better home for women technologists.

This panel will export these and other questions from the audience. There will be an opportunity to submit questions ahead of time to give panelists a chance to prepare deeper answers. Questions from the floor will also be addressed if there is time.

A few candidate panelists are:

ThoughtWorks
Winner of 2016 Anita Borg Top Tech Companies for Women.
