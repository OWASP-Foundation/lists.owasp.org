<PRE>Sounds great Tanya, I can help with the WIA mailing list, liaison with
partners, events and liaison for WIA and Mentors Committee. We are planning
local WIA events in Brooklyn and interested in hosting a national WIA event
here in NYC if there is interest in 2018. Cheers, Bev

&gt;<i> Hello WIA members, this is Tanya Janca, your new chair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to change the way we do things.  We are not just an organization
</I>&gt;<i> that organizes female-friendly events for the AppSec conferences.  We will
</I>&gt;<i> do much, much more.  This means partnering with other women&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> organizations, letting many, many more people join us, media interaction
</I>&gt;<i> and promotion, and having people run events, from small to large, mostly
</I>&gt;<i> independently and locally.  If we expect the leadership of WIA to have a
</I>&gt;<i> hand in each event, we will be too slow and limited.  Instead, WIA will
</I>&gt;<i> provide leadership and support to the many things that our members will do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I propose the following agenda for our meeting on Tuesday:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I will ask for volunteers to coordinate or perform key efforts (someone
</I>&gt;<i> to approve mailing list messages, someone to lead the AppSec USA effort and
</I>&gt;<i> someone for each event we want to do and someone to find a female speaker
</I>&gt;<i> who will be attending c0c0n to do a talk for Shruthi as part of a WIA
</I>&gt;<i> event).  We have many more key positions, but I will start with those for
</I>&gt;<i> now as they are time-sensitive.  Please feel free to volunteer for these
</I>&gt;<i> before the meeting by emailing me.  <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Talk about how I see us moving forward, with activities for all types
</I>&gt;<i> of members to be active for us and with us.  I want us to be much, much
</I>&gt;<i> more active at the local level.  I want us to have mini-tasks that anyone
</I>&gt;<i> can do.  If someone wants to help, no matter who they are, I want them to
</I>&gt;<i> have something to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Open Call for ideas moving forward, big and small.  You can email me
</I>&gt;<i> these directly if you are shy or we run out of time: <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Homework.  The last 3-5 minutes of each WIA meeting I plan to give
</I>&gt;<i> everyone optional &#8220;homework&#8221; that they can consider doing between now and
</I>&gt;<i> the next meeting.  Items will be something small, such as sharing an
</I>&gt;<i> article you liked that woman wrote and then tweeting it at the WIA twitter
</I>&gt;<i> feed.  Homework is always optional, it&#8217;s just an idea of something you can
</I>&gt;<i> do to help for you to consider.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tanya Janca
</I>&gt;<i> (Your new chair)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS In the near future I will be looking for volunteers for the following,
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know if you are interested:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) someone to manage partnerships with other women&#8217;s groups, this means
</I>&gt;<i> figuring out when to ask for help and how, plus maintaining a list of who
</I>&gt;<i> wants to help us.  We have several offers and if you want we could have one
</I>&gt;<i> person per partnership or one for all.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) someone to maintain a list of female speakers who are talented and
</I>&gt;<i> available/willing to do AppSec talks and mention WIA and OWASP, this person
</I>&gt;<i> will put these women in touch with people looking for female speakers.  The
</I>&gt;<i> speakers do not need to be members of WIA, but they *must* be OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> positive/ethical/willing to mention OWASP at some point.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) men who are willing to do interviews or write an article about why they
</I>&gt;<i> care about WIA and how it has a positive effect for both men and women when
</I>&gt;<i> there are more women in AppSec.  I already have an online newspaper
</I>&gt;<i> interested in doing an article.  Please contact me if you are interested in
</I>&gt;<i> talking about your experiences!
</I>&gt;<i> 4) women who are willing to do interviews or write articles that mention
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP, AppSec, etc.  If you want to mention WIA too, that&#8217;s great, but just
</I>&gt;<i> having female guests on a podcast would be a huge change at this point
</I>&gt;<i> (many popular podcasts have one &lt; 1 female guest per year).
