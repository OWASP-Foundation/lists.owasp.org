*IAVA Highlights She Who Borne The Battle at Meeting of &quot;The Military
Coalition&quot;*

*Coalition of 32 Leading Organizations Represent the Power of the Veterans
Community *

*Washington, DC (July 6, 2017) **-- *Today, IAVA's Director of
Intergovernmental and Political Affairs, Melissa Bryant, attended the
monthly meeting of The Military Coalition (TMC) in Washington. D.C. on
behalf of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA).

The Military Coalition is a group of 32 leading military, veterans, and
uniformed services organizations that meets monthly in the Washington D.C.
area to discuss shared priorities on behalf of their respective
organizations and memberships. The strong and dynamic coalition is a
unique, unified group of the true leaders in Washington driving veterans
policy. Together, TMC represents more than 5.5 million members of the
uniformed services--active, reserve, retired, survivors, veterans--and
their families. With a smaller percentage of Americans (and members of
Congress) having served than ever before, the role of TMC is more important
now than at any other time in history. For more on TMC click here

.

This month, Bryant updated the group on IAVA's groundbreaking She Who Borne
the Battle
&lt;<A HREF="http://click.mail.iava.org/?qs=c32d913bd776bcaa004e4ab45cff04f150dd1b79cb88b7d843da600af19c7c73982c5f0b9833c543ad016774d940887f8f5da917df9acfbf">http://click.mail.iava.org/?qs=c32d913bd776bcaa004e4ab45cff04f150dd1b79cb88b7d843da600af19c7c73982c5f0b9833c543ad016774d940887f8f5da917df9acfbf</A>&gt;
campaign to improve services and increase recognition for women veterans,
as well as shared the perspective of IAVA members on the Veterans
Administration budget and the future of its controversial &quot;Choice&quot; and
Community Care programs.

*She Who Borne The Battle:  More than 345,000 American women have deployed
since 9/11 and over 2.2 million women veterans live in the US total. Women
are the fastest-growing segment of the veteran population and that trend
will continue as the number of male veterans simultaneously declines over
the next decades. However, many women veterans are left without recognition
and the proper care to support their needs when they return from their
service. According to IAVA's Member Survey, only 27% of women veterans
respondents feel the public treats women veterans with respect. She Who
Borne the Battle will change this by providing a foundation of public
awareness, local support and policy changes solely targeted at recognizing
and supporting women veterans. This includes changing the exclusionary VA
motto, &quot;To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,
and for his orphan,&quot; to a motto that represents &quot;She Who Borne the Battle.&quot;

* IAVA is the leading voice of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in Washington
D.C. and communities nationwide. Led by veterans, our non-partisan advocacy
work ensures that Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and their families are
supported, protected and never forgotten. Since 2004, IAVA has been a
juggernaut in Washington D.C., creating and driving the national
conversation on issues ranging from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) to women
veteran issues to veteran unemployment.  IAVA's dedicated staff in
Washington, D.C. leads this work, advocating on behalf of our members
daily. We also train our member veterans to be powerful advocates for their
local community. IAVA is focused on results and has delivered historic
impacts. Every year since 2007, in an increasingly gridlocked political
environment and with an extremely limited operating budget, IAVA has passed
at least one major piece of groundbreaking legislation for our community
ranging from the Post-9/11 GI Bill (2008), to the VOW to Hire Heroes Act
(2011), to The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act
(2015).  See IAVA's Advocacy Program Digital Hub for the full list of
victories, our extensive policy recommendations and to learn more about how
