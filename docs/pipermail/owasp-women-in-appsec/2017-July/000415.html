<PRE>Hello WIA members, this is Tanya Janca, your new chair.

I want to change the way we do things.  We are not just an organization that organizes female-friendly events for the AppSec conferences.  We will do much, much more.  This means partnering with other women&#8217;s organizations, letting many, many more people join us, media interaction and promotion, and having people run events, from small to large, mostly independently and locally.  If we expect the leadership of WIA to have a hand in each event, we will be too slow and limited.  Instead, WIA will provide leadership and support to the many things that our members will do.

I propose the following agenda for our meeting on Tuesday:
1) I will ask for volunteers to coordinate or perform key efforts (someone to approve mailing list messages, someone to lead the AppSec USA effort and someone for each event we want to do and someone to find a female speaker who will be attending c0c0n to do a talk for Shruthi as part of a WIA event).  We have many more key positions, but I will start with those for now as they are time-sensitive.  Please feel free to volunteer for these before the meeting by emailing me.  <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org</A>
2) Talk about how I see us moving forward, with activities for all types of members to be active for us and with us.  I want us to be much, much more active at the local level.  I want us to have mini-tasks that anyone can do.  If someone wants to help, no matter who they are, I want them to have something to do.
3) Open Call for ideas moving forward, big and small.  You can email me these directly if you are shy or we run out of time: <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org</A>
4) Homework.  The last 3-5 minutes of each WIA meeting I plan to give everyone optional &#8220;homework&#8221; that they can consider doing between now and the next meeting.  Items will be something small, such as sharing an article you liked that woman wrote and then tweeting it at the WIA twitter feed.  Homework is always optional, it&#8217;s just an idea of something you can do to help for you to consider.

Thank you,

Tanya Janca
(Your new chair)

PS In the near future I will be looking for volunteers for the following, please let me know if you are interested:
1) someone to manage partnerships with other women&#8217;s groups, this means figuring out when to ask for help and how, plus maintaining a list of who wants to help us.  We have several offers and if you want we could have one person per partnership or one for all.
2) someone to maintain a list of female speakers who are talented and available/willing to do AppSec talks and mention WIA and OWASP, this person will put these women in touch with people looking for female speakers.  The speakers do not need to be members of WIA, but they *must* be OWASP positive/ethical/willing to mention OWASP at some point.  
3) men who are willing to do interviews or write an article about why they care about WIA and how it has a positive effect for both men and women when there are more women in AppSec.  I already have an online newspaper interested in doing an article.  Please contact me if you are interested in talking about your experiences!
4) women who are willing to do interviews or write articles that mention OWASP, AppSec, etc.  If you want to mention WIA too, that&#8217;s great, but just having female guests on a podcast would be a huge change at this point (many popular podcasts have one &lt; 1 female guest per year).
