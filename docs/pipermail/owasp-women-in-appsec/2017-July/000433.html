<PRE>I can reply more later - but yes I can take on the reg desk seat - seems to fit well as the volunteer coordinator.

If I recall this means I won't have to pay for conference but have to cover my flight and hotel, right?

Hi Wendy,

Thank you for preparing this. It is a great panel concept. Unfortunately, so far, OWASP Global has refused to allow us to have a panel for this year's AppSecUSA, however, I have asked them to reconsider, but so far, the answer is still &quot;no&quot;. I'm very disappointed in this because Bil and I both reached out to the AppSecUSA Committee months ago to request WIA programming be included in the AppSecUSA event. Only recently did we receive a response from the Event Organizer informing us that programming was already decided and WIA not included. They agreed that we could plan programming and submit our request by the July 10th deadline. We were also informed that there are women speakers. I requested their information so that we could make them aware of WIA activites and invite them, and other speakers, to participate if interested. I have so far received no response. Of course, I protested this &quot;selective&quot; and what I consider &quot;dismissive&quot; treatment by OWASP Global to the WIA committee and requested that there be a change in the current process as I do not believe that it alligns well with the OWASP Board's strategy for the OWASP Foundation. In any case, at this stage, instead of putting any more efforts into a panel at this event, perhaps you might be willing to focus on inviting the current speakers on the current program to participate in the WIA activities? What are your thoughts? Also, we need someone who is willing to take responsibility for the WIA seat at the AppSecUSA registration desk. Would you be willing to take responsibility for that? We can work on having a WIA panel at AppSecUSA and EU 2018, and submit our sincere disappointment about the way that things were handled this year to the OWASP BoD. There is also a Leaders Review Group that anyone is welcome to join where we review things like this. I will add this item to our list for discussion among other leaders at the leaders reviews meetings. Thank you and best wishes.

Sincerely,
Bev

</I>&gt;<i> Here is an initial draft for the panel proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  ----
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is well known that there are a disproportionately low number of women in IT and an even lower number who focus on security. Despite these low numbers, some organizations have been very successful in recruiting and retaining women.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What can we learn from these organizations to attract more women to security and other technical professions thereby increasing the number of women in our fields.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And in the meantime, can we use some of the proven techniques to make our own companies more attractive to and a better home for women technologists.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This panel will export these and other questions from the audience. There will be an opportunity to submit questions ahead of time to give panelists a chance to prepare deeper answers. Questions from the floor will also be addressed if there is time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few candidate panelists are:
