<PRE>Hello all,

As your chair, I have made some decisions that I think you should all be aware of.  I am also looking for some volunteers.

Decisions:
There will be no mentoring lunch at AppSec USA, as there is no volunteer to lead it.  We will concentrate on the WIA Hang Out room instead.  We will be making it the coolest place at the conference to be.  I&#8217;ve already got several speakers who have agreed to stop by. 
There will be no &#8220;in person&#8221; meeting at AppSec USA for WIA.  We will have it online the week after.  As most of us will not be attending the event, they will miss out, and the people who are there need to &#8220;work&#8221; the WIA Hang Out room and also I want them to attend the conference and learn.  We can accomplish much more with a virtual meeting the following week.  
I don&#8217;t want us to have all of our conversations on the mailing list anymore, I want us to have a slack Channel.  I think Wendy created one for Bev and I before&#8230;.  I want us to have a slack channel and have our discussions are there from then on.  I will let you all know when it&#8217;s ready.  The mailing list is when there is something big that we need to say to everyone.  I am looking for a volunteer to create and administer the slack channel, please email me if you are willing to take this on.
We are going start a monthly WIA News Letter, so that people who are interested but who do not want to be on the committee can still help us and see what we are up to.  I am looking for a volunteer to do this.  Email me if you are interested.  We will list all of the WIA or WIA-friendly events in this, and anything else we think people might like to know, plus &#8220;homework&#8221; for people to do to help our cause in their own life.
I plan to push AppSec USA very hard to give free admittance to people who have filled the forms to volunteer for AppSec USA for WIA.  Please list WIA in your application form.  If you already filled it and didn&#8217;t put that please give me your name so I know and I can talk to them.
I do not plan to pay all-expense-trips to AppSec for anyone out of the WIA budget.  If this was previously unclear, I apologize.  If you have other funding and are very close to being able to attend but not quite, we can talk.  Please email me directly about this if need be.  I can also give you ideas of how you can try to find funds for yourself via various means.
We are going to make a WIA website, which will let people sign up for the news letter, and see a link to our twitter feed.  We will expand it as need be, and we hope to have it ready before AppSec USA.  


Questions I have for all of you (please reply in emails directly to me, not the mailing list).
Who plans to attend AppSec USA this year?  I need to know who will be there to help run the WIA Room.
Who wants to work on the News Letter?
Who wants to work on the slack channel?
Who needs help sorting out their volunteer forms?

Thank you all,

Tanya
