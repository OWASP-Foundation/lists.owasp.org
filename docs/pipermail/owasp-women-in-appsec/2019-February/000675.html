<PRE>Reminder &#8211; this is the last week to submit to the first round of our CFP (Call for Presentations). 

 

This is going to be a truly fabulous event, I highly recommend participating! Most of our talks will be selected from the first round, so do your best to get your submission in now. And please share with your chapter / project list / anyone else that has something interesting to share! :) 

 

Submit here: <A HREF="https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/program/call-for-papers">https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/program/call-for-papers</A> 

 

And if you are concerned about submitting, or this would be your first time speaking at a conference &#8211; don&#8217;t worry! We will support you the whole way and provide any mentoring you need. (You can even reach out to me personally for support, as I am not on the content review committee :) ) 

One more note: we are working on dedicating a budget to assist a few speakers that would not otherwise be able to join us, due to lack of funds or employer &#8211; so do not let this hold you back. 

 

Chapter Leaders: if you will be having a chapter meeting any time soon, we&#8217;d really appreciate if you could share this at your meeting! If you would like a slide to display the details, there is one here (<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EFi9Ke6eYBQ0nCC24ZhxFW5MozCj46rnhUpi0WoOHEU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EFi9Ke6eYBQ0nCC24ZhxFW5MozCj46rnhUpi0WoOHEU/edit?usp=sharing</A>) .

We are expecting hundreds of OWASP leaders and security professionals to be joining us. Our theme this year is &#8220;AppSec: The Community of Innovation&#8221;. 

More details will be at <A HREF="https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/">https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/</A> as they are available.
