*Technical Advisor III: Senior Gender Advisor*

Priority Populations, Integration &amp; Rights Division, Office of HIV/AIDS,
Bureau for Global Health, United States Agency for International Development
Location: Arlington, Virginia
Assignment: One year fellowship
GHFP-II-P7-258

The Global Health Fellows Program (*GHFP-II*) is a cooperative agreement
implemented and managed by the Public Health Institute in partnership with
Global Health Corps, GlobeMed, Management Systems International and PYXERA
Global. GHFP-II is supported by the US Agency for International Development
(USAID).

GHFP-II&#8217;s goal is to improve the effectiveness of USAID health programs by
addressing the Agency&#8217;s immediate and emerging human capacity needs. The
program seeks to accomplish this goal first through the recruitment,
placement and support of diverse health professionals at the junior, mid
and senior levels. These program participants include fellows, interns,
corporate volunteers and Foreign Service National professionals. The
program then provides substantial performance management and career
development support to participants, including annual work planning
assistance, and ensures that professional development opportunities are
available.

Looking to the future, GHFP-II also seeks to establish a pool of
highly-qualified global health professionals that will ensure the Agency&#8217;s
ongoing technical leadership and effectiveness. This objective is supported
by an extensive outreach program that brings global health opportunities
and specialized career advice to a diverse range of interested individuals,
with a particular focus on those underrepresented in the field of global
health.
