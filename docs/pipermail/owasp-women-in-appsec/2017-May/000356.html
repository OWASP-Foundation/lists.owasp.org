*How it works*



Any code/tool project can participate in the OWASP Code Sprint. Each
project will be guided by an OWASP mentor. Students are evaluated in the
middle and at the end of the coding period, based on success criteria
identified at the beginning of the project. Successful students will
receive $750 after each evaluation, a total of $1500 per student.

ALL STUDENTS PLEASE APPLY HERE

Project Summit Belfast Recap

OWASP had another successful project summit at AppSec Europe Belfast. The
Project Summit is a combination project working session and program
improvement session for OWASP Projects. In addition to presenting their
projects
&lt;<A HREF="http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/6b257c645d/usp=sharing">http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/6b257c645d/usp=sharing</A>&gt;
to the summit, the leaders discussed ways for their projects to collaborate
and there was a proposal from one leader to combine two existing projects
with some additional work into a new third project. Project leaders were
very excited about up coming improvements to OWASP and Projects, including
Discourse, Project Handbook changes and gamification options that will be
soon available.

In addition to focusing on programmatic changes and their projects, leaders
and other community members came together to review seven applications for
projects wishing to graduate to the next level of project maturity.

If you would like to attend the next AppSec Project Summit

Chapter Leader Workshop

Before every Global AppSec Event we host a Leaders&#8217; Workshop. These
workshops serve to allow the foundation staff (and board) to hear from
Chapter and Project Leaders and to catch them up on big occurrences in the
OWASP Foundation. This year there was an unusually large portion of the
meeting dedicated to sharing information from the Foundation.

The OWASP Staff have been analyzing the Foundation&#8217;s technical debt and
engaged in deep listening activities to understand how to prioritize our
actions. This activity has led to the staff prioritizing 4 large changes to
our structure: The Website Reboot, the AMS update, a new system for mailing
lists, and a volunteer management program. These new systems will bring
more insight and control to Project and Chapter Leaders.

The Leaders&#8217; Workshop is recapped in three blog posts: OWASP Leaders&#8217;
Workshop Pt 1: 4 Major Changes and Leader Insight and Control
&lt;<A HREF="http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/58b2c8c94e">http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/58b2c8c94e</A>&gt;,
about the 4 major updates; OWASP Code Sprint 2017
&lt;<A HREF="http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/ff829869a1">http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/a6cf2b52a7/84313d29ac/ff829869a1</A>&gt;,
answering the question about the code sprint; and Chapter Questions from
the LW, discussing the other two questions leaders brought up:
(1)Discussion on move from 2 to 4 meetings per year, (2)What does the
foundation look at when judging if an event can be charged for or not? The
final blog post is not yet up.

We have also confirmed that future Leaders&#8217; Workshops will attempt to
include the webinar platform so that Leaders who are not attending the
event can still participate in the meeting.
