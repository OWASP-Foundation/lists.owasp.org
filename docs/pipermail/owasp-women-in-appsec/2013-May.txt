Hello Women in Security organisers,

I just wanted to reach out and get the conversation going again. I think
next step is to get the guidelines finalised so we can start delegating
tasks to the group. Can everyone please look at the document Helen created,
and add input. There are some questions for individual group members in the
comments section as well.

@Monika: Please look at the criteria and add some input into your thoughts
on expanding the web app sec emphasis.

@Lorna: Do you reckon you are able to locate the previous year's winners?
Let me know if you have their details and can reach out.

I would like to get this finalised by next week so we can start moving
forward. Thank you all for your time, support, and dedication to this
initiative.

Speak soon, Team.

Hello 

 

My initial thoughts/comments are:

 

General

AppSec has come a long way since the last conference sponsoring women in
that it is a much more established area of expertise.  I think that in
addition to encouraging women, we should hone in to get qualified
individuals to attend that will make an impact on the exploding number of
application breaches.  It is an advanced conference with few (or none)
glossy sessions so my thoughts are that we should focus on pulling in either
info sec women into app sec and/or application developers into app sec
(build side of OWASP's Build Break and Defend model).  

 

Add a GOAL

Establish Goal of Women in Security as it pertains to OWASP AppSec -
Increase Women in the field of Application Security

 

Enhance Objective - Award OWASP AppSec sponsorships to women candidates that
can make a difference as they embark on their careers and in organizations.

 

Eligibility comment

1.                   Was previously 'Is or has worked in information
technology and would like to explore a career in application security."

As suggested by Samantha, refinement to 'Is studying or has worked in
information systems security or application development and would like to
pursue a career in application security'.  We could have a statement
expressing flexibility or latitude by reviewers of candidates to ensure we
get enough candidate submissions.

2.                   'Each applicant must be a woman not already employed in
the field of application security who either'.  I think the point the
previous group was making was that sponsorship  should be for women who do
not have an opportunity for their companies to send them to the conference
(which is reasonable in my mind).  Is that what others on our committee
think as well?

 

Sponsorship

Devise and set exact amounts of each scholarship (Expenses and Conference
Fees but not to exceed $x)

Approach multiple organizations as needed - should give previous sponsors a
chance to sponsor.  

I know executives at financial institutions that we could approach if
needed.  

We want at least 2 sponsorships.  If we happen to get 3 sponsorships great.

 

Hope these thoughts and comments help.

Hi Monika, Samantha, Valene and subscribers,

 

Thanks to Samantha to set up the list. I like Valene's idea of using the
2011 one as a starting point. I think Monika's idea of broadening the
criteria of the grant is very interesting.

 

I believe the organizer for Women in Security in 2011 could provide valuable
input. Do you happen to know who they are? Is there a women in security
agenda in AppSec USA 2012 or any other OWASP conferences?

 

Do you also happen to know the where about of Tara Wilson and Chandni
Bhowmik, the two women who have received the grant in 2011? It would be nice
if they can give a testimonial.

 

Sorry I arrived at the volunteers meeting too late. I look forward to
meeting Monika, Valene and others in the future.

 

Below is a copy of 2011 with my comments. What do you think? If prefer to
centralize our discussion using a Google doc then I can set one up.

 


Sponsor


To sponsor future events, please e-mail  <mailto:womeninappsec at owasp.org>
womeninappsec at owasp.org. 

Helen: Is there any sponsor candidate? Should we approach Wells Fargo, the
one in 2011? What's our fundraising goal? Sponsoring 2 attendees like in
2011 with a cost of $4,000? If there is no sponsor, then can the foundation
absorb the cost?

I assume we will reuse the mailbox. Sarah just verified that she has access
to it.


About the Grant


The OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec Grant provides merit-based funding for
women to attend OWASP AppSec USA. Applicants must be employed in information
technology or studying in college and have an interest in application
security (but not already be employed in the field of application security).


Eligibility


Helen: Application security is a big field, but may not have sufficient
woman practitioners. I hope to get more input on the criteria before
changing application security to something like information security.

Each applicant must be a woman not already employed in the field of
application security who either

*	Is a part- or full-time student at an accredited four-year college
or university in the United States.
*	Is or has worked in information technology and would like to explore
a career in application security.


Application


Helen: Is October 15, 2013 (one month prior to the conference) a reasonable
deadline?

Applications and letters of reference by two distinct people (co-worker,
manager, or professor/instructor were acceptable sources) were due August
15, 2011. Applicants are notified regarding their application status.

Applicants are responsible for gathering and submitting all necessary
information. Applications are evaluated on the information supplied.
Incomplete applications are not evaluated. All information received is
considered confidential and is reviewed only by the OWASP Women in AppSec
Grant committee.


Selection of Recipients


The OWASP Women in AppSec Grant committee makes travel and lodging
arrangements and facilitates training and conference attendance for selected
individuals.


Obligations


Recipients have no obligation to the OWASP Foundation.


Revisions


OWASP reserves the right to review the conditions and procedures of this
grant program and to make changes at any time including termination of the
program.

Hi Lorna,

Welcome back. Thanks for locating these two women. I think it would be a
good idea to ask them to write a testimonial or how the award helped them.
We can use it for recruiting sponsors. What do you think?

Regards,

Helen

Hi Lorna,

 

Welcome back. Thanks for locating these two women. I think it would be a
good idea to ask them to write a testimonial or how the award helped them.
We can use it for recruiting sponsors. What do you think?

 

Regards,

 

Helen

Helen: I agree that we should allow open the application to doctoral
students, but I believe there are enough women infosec practitioners so we
can award two of them who have made a difference and are in the position of
spreading the OWASP message.

Helen: This is an interesting point. I hope that when we review the
applications, we can strike a balance between helping the two individuals
and helping the organization.

Helen: That's great. I recommend call for sponsors as soon as possible.  If
the foundation can provide the fund just in case no sponsor responded then
we can open the application now. In the unlikely case of no sponsorship, we
can at least allow two women from the New York metropolitan area (which
includes the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) with almost no
air fair and hotel. As a matter of fact, I recommend giving 5 free
admissions to women attendees to make a bigger impact.

Thanks to Valene for these great ideas. I hope she doesn't mind that I put
them in the Google doc for references.  Each one of us has provided our
unique viewpoint. Is now a good time to have a phone conference? Samantha,
are you still in NYC? I hope Sarah can join us in the meeting too.

Lorna has provided the contacts for the 2 winners of 2011. I hope they can
provide a testimonial which will help us recruiting sponsors.

Hope these thoughts and comments help.

Yes I think we should schedule a phone call. How is everyone's schedule
looking for Thursday or Friday?

Yes, that would be great. Thank you, Lorna. Could you ask if they would
mind sending us a brief testimonial of their experience? A couple of
sentences or so would be ok, I would say.

Thank you, Lorna.

Hello Women in AppSec Team,


I have gone ahead and put together a draft
version<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zrdlde11x96CLfDRCGCexeguTc_U3ZdRwNXty7V-Yhk/edit?usp=sharing>of
the guidelines and criteria for the grant program based on everyone's
input. Please have a look at our google document and add any comments,
questions, and/or discussion points. The copy is mostly based on the 2011
copy from the website, modified to fit our discussions and changes.


Additionally, I am going to be scheduling a call between all of us on
Friday at 12 noon EST. Please do let me know if you have a conflict during
this time.


Now, below is some copy I put together for the appsec usa website. We can
use this copy in the interim while we finalise our criteria, sponsorships,
etc. Please have a read and let me know if it is good to post.


Thank you, All. Have a great afternoon.

Hello all,

 

Thanks to Samantha and all for the meeting on Friday in which I thought we
made a lot of progress.  It was helpful for me to understand how the OWASP
ticket allocation and money raised could work.   

 

As we discussed, here is a draft of the Introductory first web page to
present regarding our initiative.  It focuses in on the program and
sponsorship versus the participant details at this time.  It can be updated
as we make progress with funding and perhaps as a result of feedback from
potential sponsors.

 

Thanks, 

Valene

OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program 


The OWASP Foundation supports and enhances programs to increase the
participation of women in the field of application security recognizing the
value to organizations and society.  OWASP is seeking funding at this time
to sponsor women from North America to attend an OWASP AppSec USA 2013
<http://appsecusa.org/2013/training/> training course and the OWASP AppSec
USA 2013  <http://appsecusa.org/2013/about/> conference talks to be held in
New York City in November of 2013. 

 

Current Objective

 

OWASP's current program goal is to encourage female students at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information security and/or application development to expand their skills
and pursue application security.  Attendance for two women at OWASP NY
AppSec USA 2013, an advanced application security conference, and at least
one of the in-depth training sessions, has been established as a success at
the last NY AppSec conference and this effort aims to continue and build
upon that trend.  


About the Current Program


 

The OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec program provides merit-based funding
for women to attend OWASP AppSec USA 2013 in New York. 

 

Each applicant must be a woman that meets our eligibility criteria below: 

 

.       Is a part- or full-time student at an accredited four-year college
or university or graduate program in the United States.

.       Is involved in an information technology degree and/or professional
information systems position.

.       Have an interest in pursuing application security in an information
security and/or application development role.

 

Sponsorship Opportunities 


The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  At a minimum, our goals are to raise funds to
cover for two attendees: 

.       $2,400 for recipient from outside the area for travel and lodging
and/or 

.       $300 for recipient from in the NY metro area for local travel
expenses

Subject: [Appsec_usa_women_in_security] Women in AppSec Sponsorship Breakdown
Message-ID: <CA+EttN_gsOgMixj+fNgtp-M9W3p62ZXnWTUpfm3G_xvWb0FrWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I just want to share the budget breakdown with all of you so we can all be
on the same page. Below is the information Sarah has provided to me
regarding costs of tickets and training.

Here are the costs for women in AppSec Sponsorship (but the total amount
"needed" is relative to what you all decide you want to offer)

- 2 days training (cover 40% of 1500, which is the trainer portion) = $600
- 1 ticket to appsecusa = $400 is "cost" for the ticket
- Travel, I think $2000 maximium was discussed for flight and hotel and misc

This brings it to $3000/person

Essentially this means that the total amount we need is $3,000 for each
winner. Since we are hoping to have 2 winners, we are aiming for $6,000
total in sponsorship money.

Now, if we manage to get local winners, we will only need $1300 for each
winner. That is $2600 for both to cover their local expenses, conference
ticket, and training.

I just wanted to clarify these figures for everyone. I will amend the
website blurb, and re-send for approval.

Thank you, Team.

Sam G.

Hello Team,

Everyone please have a look at the copy below. It is what we will be
placing on the appsec usa website if everyone is in agreement. Please let
me know if you have any amendments by the end of day Wednesday so we can
forward this to the web team.

I have made a few adjustments based on the numbers we need for sponsorship.
Please review, and let me know if you are happy with the copy.
Additionally, to Bev's point, should we amend the criteria to include women
not currently pursuing a degree?

Have a great evening, All.

Hello Women in AppSec Team,

I just wanted to reach out and get the ball rolling again with our
initiatives and plans. We now have the Women in AppSec blurb up on the
AppSec USA 2013 website:
http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-women-in-application-security-appsec-program/

Thank you so much for everyone who pitched in.

Now, we should think about moving forward with putting together the copy
for the Sponsors Document. This is the document we will be sending to
potential sponsors for the program. I have put together a quick draft what
what I feel we can send over to potential sponsors. Please have a read
below, and add in any comments, suggestions, omissions, changes, etc.
-----------------------------------------

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November
of 2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP?s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information security and/or application development, to expand their skills
and pursue application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC
AppSec USA 2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training
sessions, will be the award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec
Program was successfully launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event
hopes to build on that trend and further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

 - $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to the
AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page<http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/>
.

*Past Winners*

Should we add a section here with quotes from our past winners? What do you
all think?

*Additional Information*

If you have questions, or if you wish to contribute to the program, please
e-mail Samantha Groves at: appsec_usa_women_in_security at lists.owasp.org

-----------------------------------------

Thank you for your continued contribution to this initiative, Team.

Sam G.

Dear Samantha,

This looks great, thank you!

A few comments:

I think that the objectives should match what is on the website to avoid
any confusion or misunderstandings in the award sponsors, awardees, and
award guidelines for the selection committee.

Has the value on the AppSec website placement been determined? I'm
concerned because I think that the actual value is going to be more than
the sponsor amount. It seems to me that the valuation is rather low.
Shouldn't a value be assigned to the different sponsorship benefits?

Also, will the sponsors be mentioned on social media? Facebook? Twitter?
Mailing list announcements, etc? If so, the value should be much greater
than $3000, more like $6000, don't you think?

Just my two cents worth at this point, but that is what "jumped out" at me
at first glance. Thank you and best wishes.

Sincerely,
Bev

Hmm that is interested. I copied and pasted the objective right from what
Sarah sent to Nguyet to post. Did you change the copy afterwards, Sarah?
Let us know so we can all be on the same page.

I agree, we should probably place a value on the sponsorship benefit, and I
feel $6000 is an accurate number. I also agree that we should announce the
sponsorship award along with the sponsor on our social media channels. How
does everyone feel about that?

SG

Samantha -
The only change that I know about that Tom asked Nguyet to make is removing
"OWASP" from the heading since everything on the website is "OWASP" it
seemed redundant.

I just compared the objectives on the website to the copy you suggested and
they look the same to me (what am i missing)?

Dear Sarah, and Samantha,

Thanks for the comparison, yes, looks good. I was thinking of another
document that I recall reading on one of the pages, was it the "call" page
perhaps? I'm not sure of all the URLs at this stage, just saying that we
should be sure to check them for consistency. Sorry for any confusion, best
wishes.

Bev

PS: Regarding the valuation, from what I recall working in development /
marketing from other organizations, there are some standard formulas for
determining "value". For example, the number of people subscribed to your
lists, twitter, facebook, etc., would have some basis on the overall value
determination, and since OWASP has such significant numbers, I do believe
that the $3000 valuation may be quite low, so worth looking into. I do not
know the standard formulas myself, but we may want to research that at some
point. Best wishes, Bev

Thank you for the input, Bev. That is an excellent point. Can you perhaps
do some research to see if you can find some of the formulas? I think that
will be very helpful.

Thank you, Bev.

Hello All,

Hello All,

Just sending this copy over again for your review. This is what our
sponsorship document will contain, and we will use this to reach out to
potential sponsors for support of the program.

Please read through it and make comments, or discuss any additions or
omission you may have.

Bev brought up a great point last week regarding valuation systems. Bev,
have you been able to find some of the formulas we can use?

Additionally, I would love to get a short summary from our previous
winners. Helen, can you lead this initiative?

I would like to get this copy finalised by early next week.

*OWASP Women in Application Security (AppSec) Program*

*Seeking Sponsorship*

The OWASP Foundation, in recognition of value to both organizations and
society, is working to support and enhance programs that increase the
participation of women in the field of application security.  As part of
this effort, OWASP is currently seeking funds to sponsor women from North
America to attend  OWASP AppSec USA to be held in New York City in November of
2013.

*Objectives*

OWASP?s current program objective is to encourage female students at both
the undergraduate and graduate levels who are dedicated to a career in
information
security and/or application development, to expand their skills and pursue
application security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA
2013 conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will
be the award for this year's winners. The Women in AppSec Program was
successfully launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year's event hopes to
build on that trend and further engage women in the community.

*Sponsorship Needs*

The OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is currently leading the effort to seek
sponsors for this program.  Our goals are to raise funds to sponsor at
least two attendees:

- $3,000 for recipient #1 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel and
accommodation.

-  $3,000 for recipient #2 to cover conference fee, training fee, travel
and accommodation.

*Sponsor Opportunities: What do our sponsors receive? *

All OWASP Women in AppSec sponsors will receive the following benefits for
contributing funds to this program:

- Sponsors mention in the AppSec USA Program

- Logo, company name, and link to company website will be added to the
AppSec USA website in the Sponsors Page<http://appsecusa.org/2013/sponsors/>
.

*Past Winners*

Should we add a section here with quotes from our past winners? What do you
all think?

*Additional Information*

If you have questions, or if you wish to contribute to the program, please
e-mail Samantha Groves at: appsec_usa_women_in_security at lists.owasp.org[image:
Look up in Salesforce]

-----------------------------------------

Thank you for your continued contribution to this initiative, Team.

Hello there, I have a few calls out, and plan to meet to discuss soon.
Found this from googling, and it looks similar to what I've seen others do
with their valuations:

http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/2990-How-to-Calculate-the-Value-of-an-Email-Subscriber

I'm going to ask the Information Architecture Institute if we can share the
template that we created for our partners. It breaks down some values of
mailings, twitter, facebook, social media, etc. Would OWASP be interested
in having the Information Architecture Institute as an association partner?
I can help set that up, if they are. The IAI has an interesting partner
program, in contrast to what OWASP is doing:
http://iainstitute.org/en/about/partners.php

There are other possible association partners, as well, W3C, UxPA, etc. Let
me know if you want me to help.

This looks good, thank you for the updates. Best wishes.

Bev

Hello Bev,

I've had a look at the article and it look great. I don't know if we
currently have the data needed to get an accurate value of offerings at the
present time. I feel we would be spending most of our time digging up this
information to get the figure instead of spending our time getting the work
done to get this program off the ground this year. What do the rest think?
Let me know your thoughts on the matter.

I can help set that up, if they are. The IAI has an interesting partner program, in contrast to what OWASP is doing:?http://iainstitute.org/en/about/partners.php

Additionally, I would love to get a short summary from our previous winners. Helen, can you lead this initiative??

Hi Samantha,

I appreciate the thoughts regarding the status of the current
organizational data and it sounds like it may be beyond the organization's
current capacity. I'd recommend trying to do a few things in parallel: 1.
Try to determine which values are specifically useful to OWASP. 2. Try to
identify other values that may not have been mentioned in this formula, but
which may apply to OWASP. 3. Try to estimate some of the values, if you do
not have actual values. 4. Try to start logging and tracking some of the
key values of the organizational data in spreadsheets. 5. Explore and
research other similar formulas that are available for this. A good way is
to interview other organizations and what they are using for these values.
A good place to start is with partner organizations. Since this is outside
of my area of expertise, I'm not sure whether or not there are any
standards, so I'd recommend finding out if there are, and then learning
about them, too, for OWASP's longer term goals and then integrating them
into an organizational data strategy, as well, as part of a larger
organizational development strategy. I hope that this helps.

Best wishes,
Bev

Hello,

I just learned about OWASP's efforts with the Women in AppSec Program and am really eager to find out ways in which iSEC Partners can support this. I was specifically thinking about helping with the sponsorship opportunities for AppSec but am also open to other avenues.

Happy to hop on the phone if it's easier.

Thanks!
