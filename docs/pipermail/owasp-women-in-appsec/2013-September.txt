There are a couple of criteria points that I would disagree with. Since the original goal of the program was to get women interested in OWASP and Application Security in general. I think it goes against this goal to make it a criteria with points attached to have the applicant have previously attend an OWASP event, activity, have volunteered with OWASP previously, or be an OWASP member. I also think it is a mistake to have a qualification that the applicant be a student. 
The original intent was outreach and inclusion, where this comes off as you already have to be a member of the "club" to be considered.

Just my opinion, 

Lorna

Hi everyone, For the record, I agree with Lorna in regards to removing the
student and other OWASP related criteria in order to be more inclusive, and
to attract new interest in OWASP participation, by women, in general.
Previously I agreed with these items, however, mostly based on the spirit
of compromise. Best wishes, Bev

I believe it is our goal to get women involved in AppSec, this is done by providing knowledge, networking and mentoring. Also, the list isn?t a qualification list, but more of a score card to guide us into choosing the right candidate for this honorarium.

 

The question is why would we give away $3000 worth of training and expenses if someone doesn?t know anything about OWASP or someone who has never at least been motivated enough to attend a meeting. Maybe I am slightly biased since we have several women working in companies and attending school that attend NYC and NJ OWASP meetings. The checklist listed below is not the most current one, Samantha has made some  changes based on team suggestions.

 

The updated criteria below is sorted by points. There seem to be 4 categories: Experience (12 points), References (11), Interest (2) and OWASP member (2). This is the 5th edition. Albeit not perfect, it has included everybody's input. Let's finalize it before Sept. 9 as planned.

I think if the programs goal was to get women interested in AppSec it should have been called ?Women Interested In AppSec? not ?Women In AppSec? it?s a bit misleading. You?d have a better result getting people ?interested? through an interactive webinar where they can ask questions and build a rapport with various presenters. Then you take the presentation and post on youtube in an OWASP Women In AppSec channel. Have links to register for the next WebEx. Then again, these are my opinions based on my experiences in security and financial services training.

Have a great Friday, and let?s keep working strong to have all the kinks ironed out for Monday?s deadline.

Great Job Everyone!

My thought is, those women in AppSec that are part of OWASP already get it.
Awarding them does not spread awareness (even if it is good).

I'd rather set up awards for young women who are doing well in school or
otherwise demonstrate they merit support. I want to help accelerate their
infosec education. That's how we really make a difference in my opinion.

Aloha,

I agree with Jim in this aspect about helping while they are young but at what age was always my question. Perfect example was 3 years ago, a 9 yr old Hacked the BlackBoard system for his school. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/14/AR2010041404159.html  The way to educate the young is to educate the educators or become an educator ourselves by either teaching, mentoring or guest speakers at various schools. If we were to focus on the young professionals/students we would need to develop an OWASP Kids program, OWASP Educational Grant Program, or OWASP Mentor program. 

 

One thing is for sure, from the 32 diverse current candidates ?. It will be a tough pick.

 

Cheers,

 

Tom Ryan

My thought is, those women in AppSec that are part of OWASP already get it. Awarding them does not spread awareness (even if it is good).

 

I'd rather set up awards for young women who are doing well in school or otherwise demonstrate they merit support. I want to help accelerate their infosec education. That's how we really make a difference in my opinion.

I believe it is our goal to get women involved in AppSec, this is done by providing knowledge, networking and mentoring. Also, the list isn?t a qualification list, but more of a score card to guide us into choosing the right candidate for this honorarium.

 

The question is why would we give away $3000 worth of training and expenses if someone doesn?t know anything about OWASP or someone who has never at least been motivated enough to attend a meeting. Maybe I am slightly biased since we have several women working in companies and attending school that attend NYC and NJ OWASP meetings. The checklist listed below is not the most current one, Samantha has made some  changes based on team suggestions.

 

The updated criteria below is sorted by points. There seem to be 4 categories: Experience (12 points), References (11), Interest (2) and OWASP member (2). This is the 5th edition. Albeit not perfect, it has included everybody's input. Let's finalize it before Sept. 9 as planned.

I think if the programs goal was to get women interested in AppSec it should have been called ?Women Interested In AppSec? not ?Women In AppSec? it?s a bit misleading. You?d have a better result getting people ?interested? through an interactive webinar where they can ask questions and build a rapport with various presenters. Then you take the presentation and post on youtube in an OWASP Women In AppSec channel. Have links to register for the next WebEx. Then again, these are my opinions based on my experiences in security and financial services training.

Have a great Friday, and let?s keep working strong to have all the kinks ironed out for Monday?s deadline.

Great Job Everyone!

There are a couple of criteria points that I would disagree with. Since the original goal of the program was to get women interested in OWASP and Application Security in general. I think it goes against this goal to make it a criteria with points attached to have the applicant have previously attend an OWASP event, activity, have volunteered with OWASP previously, or be an OWASP member. I also think it is a mistake to have a qualification that the applicant be a student. 
The original intent was outreach and inclusion, where this comes off as you already have to be a member of the "club" to be considered.

 

Just my opinion, 

 

Lorna
