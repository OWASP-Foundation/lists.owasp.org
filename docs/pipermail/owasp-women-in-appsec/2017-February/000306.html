<PRE>As a follow up to our February call, below is the link to WIA Membership
list.  Please check to ensure you're on the list and that I have correct
information for you.  You can send any corrections directly to me.  Once we
elect a Secretary, I will hand off this spreadsheet to that officer to own
and maintain.

On the spreadsheet you will see the following:


   - Your name
   - Your chapter / location
   - If you're an OWASP member, the expiration date of your membership.
   Note that mine looks a little funky, it's because I'm a lifetime member so
   I picked a date far out into the future.
   - If you're an OWASP member, how many more days until your membership
   expires.  If you let your OWASP membership lapse and are a Voting Member,
   you will lose your Voting Member status.  Please renew your OWASP
   membership early.
   - WIA Membership type (Voting or Participating).  I'll explain them in
   more detail below.
   - WIA Joined - this is when Voting Members joined the WIA committee
   formally as a voting member.
   - WIA Renewed - Voting Members must &quot;renew&quot; their interest in being on
   the committee every six months.  This is when they last did it.
   - WIA Next Renewed - This is when Voting Member must next &quot;renew&quot; their
   interest of being on the committee.  An email will be sent, unless you
   reply &quot;yes&quot; you will be dropped as a Voting Member (i.e. reply &quot;no&quot; or
   don't reply at all).
   - Meeting Attendance - if there's a &quot;1&quot; it means you attended the
   meeting.  Please ensure I have your attendance correctly, as we'll track
   this for participation, which is used to ensure Voting Members are meeting
   their obligations, and used for Participating Members if they want to
   become Voting Members.  Note that this is NOT the only measurement we will
   use, we will likely use other metrics, such as participation on the WIA
   list, participation on special projects, etc.  Once decided, we'll probably
   track those as well.


To elaborate on the membership types, there are two types of members:


   - Voting - these members can serve in leadership positions of the
   committee, can vote, and have participation obligations.  If you are listed
   as &quot;Voting&quot; it means you are a voting member of the WIA Committee.  Only
   valid OWASP Members are eligible to be voting members.  If you wish to
   become a Voting Member, you must be a valid OWASP member, you must
   participate for three months in WIA Committee, and then the Voting Members
   vote to add you as a Voting Member (majority vote carries).
   - Participating - these members can serve and lead sub-committees,
   participate on the list, at meetings, and most everything else except be a
   Committee Leader and vote.


Here is the WIA Membership list:
