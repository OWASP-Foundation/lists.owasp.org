It has been about 6 that have shown interest. I really hope we can raise
funds for this. I even had the supervisor of two ladies contact me as he

Hi Samantha,

I believe we should broadcast Boston chapter's generous donation among
OWASP leaders. Do you want to do that or I can do it.

Go for it, Helen. I've already done this via twitter, facebook and
LinkedIn. I think it should definitely be done on the leaders list and any
other place you can think of. Do go on. Thank you, Helen.

Hello Team,

I am happy to report that iSEC has donated $3,000 to the program today. We
are only $2,000 away from our goal now. This is excellent news for us. I
think we can certainly say that we are ready to start the Call for Entries
at this point. What do you guys think? Shall we schedule a call to discuss
next steps? Let me know what your thoughts are on this.

Only $2000 left to go!

SG

Hi Samantha et al,

Great news! I agree that we should start the Call for Entries as soon as
possible.

I spoke to a woman manager in TIBCO, my employer, yesterday about
sponsorship. She asked lots of questions about this program and OWASP and
promised to look into this more.

Regards,

Helen

Hello there!

As a full-time, female student, I wanted to inquire the status of whether
you are actually going to be able to fund 2 participants?  If yes, how can
I apply please?

My name is Shannon McPherson, and I will be graduating this Fall from the
UMBC Master's program in Cybersecurity.  I would very much like to attend
APPSEC this year because I feel that the training information will be
pivotal for my thesis involving wireless mobile device security, encryption
of communications and some bio-tech concerns.  The training cost
unfortunately for a grad. student is steep along accommodations.

If you could please let me know how to proceed for application, I would
greatly appreciate it!

Thanks, and have a great rest of the week.

-Shannon

Hello Team,
I just wanted to reach out so we can finalize the form we are going to
be using to accept applicants. We have already managed to raise $4,000
for the program so I feel comfortable making this live. I think we
should certainly make it clear that each participant only gets 2K as
reimbursement right now, unless we are able to raise the remaining 2K.
Have a look at the form, and let me know if you have any changes. I
would like to open this up for submission by the end of this week or
the beginning of the next.
Thank you, Team.

application development, to expand their skills and pursue application
security. Attendance for two women to the OWASP NYC AppSec USA 2013
conference, and at least one of the in-depth training sessions, will be the
award for this year?s winners. The Women in AppSec Program was successfully
launched at AppSec USA in 2011 this year?s event hopes to build on that
trend and further engage women in the community.

Dear Ms. Groves,

One of our alumni passed on to me a call for sponsorship that you sent out recently. We have an increasing emphasis on cybersecurity, manifesting itself initially as a new MS degree (details at <www.uwb.edu/cybersecurity>). I'd welcome a chance to discuss how we, as a public educational institution, could work with you.

Cordially,

Mike Stiber

Hello Team,

I am happy to report that we have received another donation of $500 towards
our Program. Fiona Collins from the Dublin Chapter has kindly donated this
today. We are now only $1500 away from our yearly goal! :)
