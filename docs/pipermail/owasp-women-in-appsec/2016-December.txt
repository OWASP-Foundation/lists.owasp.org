Subject: [Women_in_security] Call for joining WIA
Message-ID: <CACtAMnPFvboZap+Jahfy-_8Wn5jgK_c0iRqVQrsERnUNT6f2YA@mail.gmail.com>

Tiffany just announced that the "call for members" for WIA has started.
You have a week to formally join via the following link:

https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGsRrOO3RiSYMGpEqi2tZgPmRqU46yspchcAtkKN2_hlS-Gw/viewform#start=openform

We need at least five members.  I know both Bev and myself have already
joined, so we need three more.

Thanks,

- Bil

Please join! And use the link at the bottom of the announcement - it isn't
really the Branding Committee - once you get to the page, it says WIA.
Happy Holidays & New Year!

Hi Bil,

This is great. Would you like to start a shared spreadsheet on your owasp
Google drive where we can track these? It would be helpful to have the due
date listed so that we can sort by due dates when we prepare our proposals.
Happy New Year!

Best wishes,
Bev
