Hello Team,

I just wanted to update everyone on the status of our fundraising. We have
now reached our fundraising goal, and just yesterday, we received another
$500.00 from the University of Washington. I didn't think we would be in a
situation where we would raise more than needed, but this is a good place
to be in, I feel. We have now raised $6,500.00 for the program.

*Below are a few key dates for everyone:*

*Women in AppSec Application Deadline:* application deadline is Monday,
September 09, 2013 at 5pm GMT

*Announcement of Winners:* First week of October 2013

*Number of applicants:* 19

*Next Steps*

We need to figure out how we manage the selection process now. We have 19
applicants so the program is quite popular. Please reply to this message
and share your ideas on how we can best manage this process.

Thank you, Team.

SG

Hi Samantha,

Thanks for the update. Have rhe applicants provided 2 references? We need a
form for the references to fill out? Should we also create a simple rating
system? For example, position in his/her company? His/her interest in
appsec/Owasp and open source in general? Familiarity with AppSec and owasp?
 number of years of experience in app sec? Members of owasp or volunteer of
other organizations? Publications?

Is a rating system used in 2011 AppSec?

BTW, I will be back from vacation on August 26 and have full Internet
access then.

Hi there everyone,

Good morning! I hope that you are all doing well. Just catching up on
emails this morning. Regarding the selection committee - Do you think that
it might be better to recruit others who are not involved in the
fundraising, sponsors, and/or event planning to be on a separate selection
committee for the scholarships to avoid any possible appearances of
conflicts of interests? Just curious what your thoughts are in regards to
an independent selection committee? Best wishes.

Bev

Hello All,

@Helen,

I think this is a great idea. Would you mind taking a stab at a first
draft?

@Lorna, Do you recall if there was a rating system used in the 2011 Women
in AppSec selection?

@Bev, we can certainly do this. Would you be willing to manage their
participation? Who did you have in mind?

SG

Hi Samantha,

Perhaps we could put out a general call to members who might be interested
in serving on a selection committee?

Other thoughts - Once we have a committee in place, we could create
selection criteria, have the board approve them, give the criteria to the
committee members. Let them vote among themselves and choose a leader.

I'll be happy to help with any coordination, documentation, oversight, etc.
if needed, how does that sound?

Best wishes,
Bev

Hello Bev,

I love your thoughts on this. However, I feel that is a bit too involved
for this process. The board of directors has their plate full at the moment
so I think seeking approval from them for selection criteria will not be
something that gets on the ToDo list for quite some time. Do you have time
to put out a call for committee members, get them together to put together
criteria, and oversee the approval of that criteria at least within the
Women in AppSec team? What do you think, Bev, as time constraints are a bit
of a concern for all of us, I think.

Hi Samantha,

Ok, sounds like a good plan, for now. Let's work with the current Women in
AppSec list to develop criteria and request selection committee members. We
can also put out a call to the general OWASP community, as well, to see if
there is interest in serving on the selection committee. Let me know how
you would like to proceed at this point.

Sincerely,
Bev

I would like to get a few more ideas on what we can move forward with. Is
everyone ok with us developing selection criteria, and then selecting a
handfull of us to do the actual selection? How does everyone feel about
that?

Hi team.

I will create a simple criteria when i get back from vacation on the 26th.
Of course if would be much better if you could create one before then. In
any case, please kindly reply to this emil to let us know if you will
participate at the selection process. If less than 5 people reply then I
may need to recruit reviewer among owasp leaders. What do you think?

Hello All,

@Helen,

I think this is a great idea. Would you mind taking a stab at a first
draft?

@Lorna, Do you recall if there was a rating system used in the 2011 Women
in AppSec selection?

@Bev, we can certainly do this. Would you be willing to manage their
participation? Who did you have in mind?

Maybe this is a very dumb question but this email chain is the only one
that I have gotten since I joined a week or two ago. I was wondering what
this selection committee is about and what event are we doing selection
for. Also, I read the first thread about raising funds so I assumed its an
event.

Could anyone describe in more detail what we are talking about?? Also, I am
based in Dallas, TX so I was looking at exploring more options at the local
chapter which I have signed up for but there didn't seem to be much out
there other than the option of signing up for a newsletter or a mailing
list and there hasn't been much activity on that either.

Thanks,
Hetal

Hi Gaglani,

Has anyone replied to your email? If not then I apologize for the overlook.

We have successfully raised $6,000 for Women in AppSec 2013 and received 39
applications so far. Two lucky women will attend the four day conference in
New York City for free, including airfare and hotel accommodation. Do you
want to help us to select the winners?

The estimated amount of work is about 10 hours for reviewing the selection
criteria and applications, checking references and a couple of team
meetings by phone before the first week of October.

Currently the selection team has three people, they are Bev Corwin, Helen
Gao and Samantha Groves. We are looking for 2 more volunteers. Please reply
to this email by Sept. 9 if you want to help out.

If you or somebody you know want to apply for the scholarship then submit
an application<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/forms/d/1WEtInvzlxLDXpTgfXh-E1E7e8H5FRfEOPIaTOizlBpk/viewform?edit_requested=true>
by
Sept. 9, 2013. Qualified women are professionals, students and faculties
who are working or interested in application security.

Many thanks to the OWASP folks in Boston
Chapter<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston>,
Ireland Dublin chapter <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland-Dublin>, Long
Island chapter <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Long_Island>, MSP
(Minneapolis and St. Paul)
chapter<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Minneapolis_St_Paul> and
our partner at iSEC for donating $6,000 for the scholarship.

I am not familiar with your local chapter. If you want to get involve then
may I recommend that you contact the chapter leader(s) directly.

Regards,

Helen Gao
