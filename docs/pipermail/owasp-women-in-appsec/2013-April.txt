Hello,

 

Welcome to all and thanks to Samantha Groves, OWASP Projects Manager, for
setting up the OWASP appsec usa women in security list.  

 

Attendees at our initial meeting at the appsec volunteer meeting in April
were Samantha Groves, Monika Chakraborty and Valene Skerpac (myself).
Please update the list if I missed anyone.

 

As we discussed at our initial meeting, I am sending out a link to previous
activities, http://2011.appsecusa.org/womeninappsec.html  from which we can
draw upon if we like.

 

Very Truly,

Valene

Thank you for sending this along, Valene.

I've had a look, and it seems we can use many of the guidelines that were
previously used in 2011. I think we might need to go ahead and create a
page for this year. Perhaps a wiki page where we can have a call for
applicants, and list the different rules and responsibilities. Then we can
start looking at sponsors for the initiative. How does that sound?

I agree. How does everyone feel about that? How would we word it
to encompass all of these fields?

Subject: [Appsec_usa_women_in_security] Greetings from Helen Gao
Message-ID: <CABCuiddaPv-y-1fFiiBU8Dw2FY5BXQ=GSgsvTRt3E6i6UB0e-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Monika, Samantha, Valene and subscribers,

Thanks to Samantha to set up the list. I like Valene's idea of using the
2011 one as a starting point. I think Monika's idea of broadening
the criteria of the grant is very interesting.

I believe the organizer for Women in Security in 2011 could provide
valuable input. Do you happen to know who they are? Is there a women in
security agenda in AppSec USA 2012 or any other OWASP conferences?

Do you also happen to know the where about of Tara Wilson and Chandni
Bhowmik, the two women who have received the grant in 2011? It would be
nice if they can give a testimonial.

Sorry I arrived at the volunteers meeting too late. I look forward to
meeting Monika, Valene and others in the future.

Below is a copy of 2011 with my comments. What do you think? If prefer to
centralize our discussion using a Google doc then I can set one up.

Sponsor

To sponsor future events, please e-mail womeninappsec at owasp.org.

Helen: Is there any sponsor candidate? Should we approach Wells Fargo, the
one in 2011? What's our fundraising goal? Sponsoring 2 attendees like in
2011 with a cost of $4,000? If there is no sponsor, then can the foundation
absorb the cost?

I assume we will reuse the mailbox. Sarah just verified that she has access
to it.
About the Grant

The OWASP Foundation Women in AppSec Grant provides merit-based funding for
women to attend OWASP AppSec USA. Applicants must be employed in
information technology or studying in college and have an interest in
application security (but not already be employed in the field of
application security).
Eligibility
Helen: Application security is a big field, but may not have sufficient
woman practitioners. I hope to get more input on the criteria before
changing application security to something like information security.

Each applicant must be a woman not already employed in the field of
application security who either

   - Is a part- or full-time student at an accredited four-year college or
   university in the United States.
   - Is or has worked in information technology and would like to explore a
   career in application security.

Application
Helen: Is October 15, 2013 (one month prior to the conference) a reasonable
deadline?

Applications and letters of reference by two distinct people (co-worker,
manager, or professor/instructor were acceptable sources) were due August
15, 2011. Applicants are notified regarding their application status.

Applicants are responsible for gathering and submitting all necessary
information. Applications are evaluated on the information supplied.
Incomplete applications are not evaluated. All information received is
considered confidential and is reviewed only by the OWASP Women in AppSec
Grant committee.
Selection of Recipients

The OWASP Women in AppSec Grant committee makes travel and lodging
arrangements and facilitates training and conference attendance for
selected individuals.
Obligations

Recipients have no obligation to the OWASP Foundation.
Revisions

OWASP reserves the right to review the conditions and procedures of this
grant program and to make changes at any time including termination of the
program.
Additional Information

Questions regarding the grant program? E-mailwomeninappsec at owasp.org.

Hi.

I just got in touch with Dr. Anid, the woman in the photo below. She was
considering participating. I am thinking may be we can do a panel
discussion? Dr. Anid is Dean of the School of Engineering and Computing
Sciences.

I also want to reach out to Joan Goodchild for the panel and sponsorship,
Executive Editor CSO Magazine and Online. Joan is speaking at the
conference anyway.

Please let me know what you think.

Warm regards,

NYIT Hosts First Meeting of the Long Island Cyber Defense
Consortium<http://www.nyit.edu/about_nyit/news/nyit_hosts_first_meeting_of_the_long_island_cyber_defense_consortium/>

*Old Westbury, N.Y. (Feb. 26, 2013)* - Yesterday, New York Institute of
Technology (NYIT) hosted a meeting initiated by Congressman Steve Israel
(D-Huntington) of what initially is being called the ?Long Island Cyber
Defense Consortium? intended to position Long Island as a ?center of
excellence? if not the cyber defense capital of America.

During the meeting, it was recalled how Long Island became the defense
capital of America during World War II, and today, the region is in a
position to take the lead in defending America again, based on the
collective expertise and competence concentrated in the area through
institutions of higher education, private industry, the utilities sector,
government labs, and the leading players in technology and energy, among
others, many of whom attended the meeting.

Rep. Israel said, ?I am extremely appreciative of New York Institute of
Technology?s willingness to host the first meeting of the Long Island Cyber
Defense Consortium. As one of Long Island?s premier educational
institutions, we are lucky to have such a priceless resource in our own
backyard. As this consortium moves forward, we anticipate NYIT playing a
pivotal role.?

The initial goals of the group are to:

   - Inventory the cyber defense capabilities of Long Island businesses and
   institutions.
   - Mobilize those capabilities and match them to the needs of federal
   cyber security entities and put Long Island at the forefront of protecting
   America against cyber attacks.
   - Seek federal support for the creation of a cyber security hub on Long
   Island.

 Representing NYIT at the meeting were Peter C. Kinney III, Chief of Staff;
and Nada Marie Anid <http://www.nyit.edu/experts/nada_anid/>, Ph.D.,
Dean, School
of Engineering and Computing Sciences <http://www.nyit.edu/engineering>.

?We are pleased to be part of a project that is so vital to the
competitiveness and safety of our nation,? Anid said. ?Our faculty, who
have tremendous expertise to contribute to this important initiative, are
winning prestigious research grants in many areas relating to cyber
security, and we look forward to being an active and collaborative member
of the consortium.?

Helen -
Please speak with Tom before inviting anyone... as he is coordinating
invited speakers (such as keynotes).  Also, I don't think Joan is speaking,
I think she is on the speaker selection committee...

Additionally, Bill and I had a call with someone at CSO magazine yesterday
about a media partnership and they have come back to us to say it won't
work because are event conflicts with other events they are already
involved with.  I don't think a sponsorship will be an option for them....

Hello Helen and All,

I like the idea of creating a google document for the criteria. Helen, Can
you put that together for us and share the link?

Additionally, I believe Lorna Almari was involved in the Women in Security
from 2011. I have cced Lorna. Lorna, do you happen to know what happened to
the 2011 winners? Do you reckon we are able to contact them?

Hello All,

 

At our initial meeting we talked about including other women in security and I promised to send our group information about the Women in Security (Cyberjutsu) group.  Lisa Foreman is the organizer and I have already attended a great technical seminar remotely regarding application reverse engineering techniques used when attempting to find problem code /security vulnerabilities when source code is not available.

 

If we want, I can reach out to Lisa and include her and others in the Women in Cyber security group to participate.  None the less, I would recommend joining (free).

 

Thanks, Valene
