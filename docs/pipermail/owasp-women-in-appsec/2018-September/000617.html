<PRE>Hi All,

Please excuse me jumping in without knowing the history of these events or the nature of the disagreement. 

My only thought is to ask you Zoe and the committee at large if there may be an option to not exclude a person from the group or OWASP. Info Sec is such a small community and women within it that much smaller. Putting myself in the place of the person &#8220;excommunicated&#8221;, it would be a great loss. 

This is a formative time for WIA so maybe we can go through the process to have the board reconsider and have an attenuated response such that a passionate person in the community is not cut off. 

Just my thoughts in case it can be reconsidered and if things can be worked out. 

Yours truly,
Alka

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have a whole lot more to add to this except to reiterate what Bil has already said and state that the board didn't over step the mark - they were simply implementing a recommendation made on the back of a report from (this) compliance committee. So really your complaint is with our recommendation? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the line you quote below Zoe (&quot;Members of the OWASP Board of Directors are allowed to become committee members, but participate as normal committee members with no special powers either expressed or implied. While Board member participation in committees is encouraged, Board members must refrain from taking an active leadership role for the committee.&quot;) isn't really intended for this situation - it is just highlighting whether or not the board can be involved in a committee, not what they as BoDs can do as part of there roles within the foundation. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With regards Bil, currently he is simply running for a BoD seat and is still a member of the compliance committee so it is entirely appropriate for him to respond to your complaint. As Bil mentioned, it was the middle of the night for me as this discussion was taking place so I am only getting the chance to respond now. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Katherine, thanks you for clarifying your stance. So far we have only heard from yourself and Zoe on this issue. If anyone else in WIA would like to respond to this thread to give their thoughts please do. Or you can respond just to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">compliance at owasp.org</A> if you would like to do so in confidence.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Bill,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Personally (and as WIA officer) I disagree with Zoe&#8217;s decision. Furthermore, I will like to clarify this is not a WIA complaint, but Zoe's. I&#8217;ve asked Zoe (on a different threat), as to why this email was sent without the WIA's discussion/ vote and she mentioned she will like to keep this discussion open (WIA committee notes: <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17r1btFUoSwxxL1hLnTmse9MY5t_5fWWmAr032gR5qrU/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/17r1btFUoSwxxL1hLnTmse9MY5t_5fWWmAr032gR5qrU/edit</A>).

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Zoe,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Responding in-kind:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. The OWASP Governance list is a public forum, I dropped them from my reply, unless you meant to make your complaint public, in which case my apologies, please add the Governance list back on your reply if you wish.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My suggestion for the Governance list was instead to make your proposal for the changes you want made to the Bylaws, Committees 2.0, or other policies, and through discussion, have a vetted proposal to take to the Board.  It wasn't to debate the merits of this thread.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Addressing your concern that the Board has taken action you perceive as infringing on the rights of the WIA committee, keep in mind they action they took was in response to the Whistleblower policy (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Whistleblower_Policy">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Whistleblower_Policy</A>), which dictates how complaints within the Foundation are handled.  There isn't a separate complaint process for WIA, so the Board was acting within their stated complaint policy.  Again, if you don't like this policy, it can be changed, but it does require the Board to vote to change it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. You are correct, I am running for the BoD, as is Richard.  Note that Richard stepped down from the Compliance Committee and isn't included on the Compliance Committee email distribution - only Fiona and I are members currently.  You're welcome to add him to the thread anyhow if you want his opinion.  Fiona is on the thread, and likely hasn't chimed in due to time zone differences (she's in Ireland currently).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Anyone on this thread is welcome to participate in this discussion.  I'm personally keen to understand why WIA would fight so hard to reinstate a member that was investigated for actions taken while volunteering for WIA and was referred to the BoD for discipline.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4. I'll add another thought, let's change the scenario a bit.  Let's say you belong to the Awesome Committee and someone on the committee did something in violation of the Code of Ethics, or other OWASP Policies.  Is it your expectation that you must have your complaint handled by the Awesome Committee, who might have a conflict of interest because the leadership of the committee have a relationship with the person you're making a complaint against?  And since there isn't any written policy or procedure for handing the complaint, they could outright dismiss it, leaving you with no recourse but to leave the Awesome Committee.  And if you took your complaint to the Compliance Committee, the Awesome Committee would complain that their autonomy is being violated, making them unaccountable to OWASP Foundation.  I don't see how how your ask would fairly serve the members of OWASP when applied globally, not to just this one case.  But again, you could carry this forward and have the Board vote to enact it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Bil,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to clarify the following based on your response, on which I encourage feedback from WIA Committee Officers and members (again, included in this email):
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Proposing changes to the OWASP Committees 2.0 Operational Model would be counterproductive in expressing my concerns, although I still include the OWASP Governance mailing list (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-women-in-appsec">governance at lists.owasp.org</A>) in this email at your suggestion. I remind you and everyone included in this email of the context of the OWASP Committees 2.0 Operational Model, under which the OWASP Women in AppSec Committee is governed:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a) On July 16, 2014, the BoD passed the OWASP Committees 2.0 Operational Model to enable an OWASP Committee to make decisions among the members of the committee, independently from the OWASP BoD. From my perspective, there appears to be an ongoing misunderstanding of the intentions behind and value of the OWASP Committees 2.0 Operational Model.  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> b) Section VII of the OWASP Committees 2.0 Operational Model (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/OWASP_Committees#VII._OWASP_Board_Participation">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/OWASP_Committees#VII._OWASP_Board_Participation</A>) explicitly states the following regarding its purpose to limit the decision rights of the few (7 listed at the moment: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project#Code_of_Ethics">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project#Code_of_Ethics</A>) OWASP BoD members:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Members of the OWASP Board of Directors are allowed to become committee members, but participate as normal committee members with no special powers either expressed or implied. While Board member participation in committees is encouraged, Board members must refrain from taking an active leadership role for the committee.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) I'd like note the possible flaw and possible conflict of interest (in my opinion) that, of the 3 OWASP Compliance Committee members, Richard Greenberg, Fiona Collins and Bil Corry (yourself), you were the one to respond to my expressing my concerns, considering that you are an OWASP BoD candidate (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2018_Global_Board_of_Directors_Election">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2018_Global_Board_of_Directors_Election</A>). I would therefore like to get input from Richard (although he's also a BoD candidate) and Fiona, in effort to receive fully representative feedback.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) I make it a point to continue the discussion by email, rather than the BoD call (not a WIA Committee call) to best continue to facilitate feedback among WIA members and Officers as I voice my concerns based on my disappointment, given the relevant facts I mention. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Again, I encourage feedback from any WIA Committee Officers and members, included in this thread.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Zoe,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Section 3.01 of the Foundation Bylaws provides the Board of Directors with broad authority to manage the business and affairs of the Foundation.  The OWASP Committees 2.0 was created by the Board to empower the members of OWASP to make decisions and act, it wasn't designed to remove power from the Board.  It's my belief the Board has acted within their authority.  If you disagree, I suggest raising the issue on the OWASP Governance List:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Additionally, if you believe Bev Corwin should be reinstated, and/or if you wish to modify the Committees 2.0 charter to limit the Board's power to act, then you should request to be added to the agenda of the next Board meeting and ask them to vote for those changes.
