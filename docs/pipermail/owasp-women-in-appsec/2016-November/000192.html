<PRE>Hello All,


Since July 2014 OWASP has used Committees as the method for members to
drive global change in targeted areas.  Committees have the ability to make
recommendations to the board with a louder voice and request funds in a way
that general groups of people do not have access to.  Because the move from
initiatives to committees has not been facilitated previously, I propose
that we honor the work done by existing active initiatives by accelerating
the process which requires the leader's list show vocal support with no
strong objections.

This means that the Board will be given notice and a call for members will
be initiated. At this time anyone may join the committee.  This is a great
opportunity to grow your committee attendance.

There are three types of members in a committee:

1) Voting members who are either founding members or invited to become
voting members after having been a participating member for at least 3
months.
2)Participating members who are able to participate in the discussions and
activities of the committee but not vote
3)Staff/Board members who are participating members with the added
restriction of not being able to lead the conversation.

After the process is done, initiatives as they exist now will be totally
phased out.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Emily, Kate, Tiffany, and Kelly, and WIA list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that you are all doing well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just reaching out re: WIA Initiative - Do we want to make the WIA
</I>&gt;<i> Initiative a Committee?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tiffany can provide details, but my understanding is that one of the
</I>&gt;<i> requirements is to have 5 committee leaders. We only currently have 2
</I>&gt;<i> (Emily and myself). I don't believe that staff can be on committees, but it
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice if they could, IMHO. They certainly are a value add. But we
</I>&gt;<i> may need to recruit 3 additional committee leaders for WIA to graduate to
</I>&gt;<i> Committee status. I assume that all committees are under the same
</I>&gt;<i> requirements. My understanding also is that there requirements about
</I>&gt;<i> posting meeting minutes to the mailing list, and actually using the mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list - maybe we should start doing that? Hopefully, Tiffany can clarify
</I>&gt;<i> details for us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you and best wishes.
