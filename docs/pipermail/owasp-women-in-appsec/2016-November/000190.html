<PRE>Quite a list of requirements to be on the committee.  I don&#8217;t know if I qualify for all of them, but I definitely hope to be able to be more active this year in WIA and I am looking forward to AppSec 2017 (wherever it is held!)

Dear Emily, Kate, Tiffany, and Kelly, and WIA list,

I hope that you are all doing well.

Just reaching out re: WIA Initiative - Do we want to make the WIA Initiative a Committee?

Tiffany can provide details, but my understanding is that one of the requirements is to have 5 committee leaders. We only currently have 2 (Emily and myself). I don't believe that staff can be on committees, but it would be nice if they could, IMHO. They certainly are a value add. But we may need to recruit 3 additional committee leaders for WIA to graduate to Committee status. I assume that all committees are under the same requirements. My understanding also is that there requirements about posting meeting minutes to the mailing list, and actually using the mailing list - maybe we should start doing that? Hopefully, Tiffany can clarify details for us.

Thank you and best wishes.

Sincerely,
Bev
