<PRE>Great! Thanks Bil, Sound good. So far, I think we have 5 now with Emily,
Tanya, Tina, Bil (you) and Bev (me). Looking forward to meeting with you
all to prepare for the compliance / transitions to Committee status. Thank
you. Best wishes, Bev

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the updates Tiffany, It will be helpful to have a complete

</I>&gt;<i> to convert to the committee framework so that we know what is still needed
</I>&gt;<i> for WIA, or any other initiatives to be compliant as a committee. I am
</I>&gt;<i> fully aware that the committee structure has been around for a while, and
</I>&gt;<i> that you came on after the fact. However, you may also take note that since
</I>&gt;<i> the committee framework was implemented at OWASP that *no one* has taken
</I>&gt;<i> any interest in it. Therefore, as I was trying to explain to you at
</I>&gt;<i> AppSecUSA, OWASP BoD and staff may want to take that into account as
</I>&gt;<i> something important about the members and larger community. If something
</I>&gt;<i> was implemented that no one wants, what good is it anyway? In addition, you
</I>&gt;<i> may also notice that there are a number of still active Initiatives that do
</I>&gt;<i> great work, however unappreciated and unrecognized by the BoD and staff.
</I>&gt;<i> The fact remains that people were willing to do Initiatives, but not many
</I>&gt;<i> are interested in Committees. I would consider this an important message
</I>&gt;<i> from your user and member communities - especially for designing any future
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;top down&quot; implementations that people apparently are not interested in
</I>&gt;<i> doing. Best wishes, Bev

</I>&gt;<i> I am sorry you feel that my intention is to start everything from the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning again.  That must be a miscommunication. As I told you the first
</I>&gt;<i> time we spoke about initiatives and committees my plan is to convert them
</I>&gt;<i> further along in the process.  Unfortunately, the committee structure is
</I>&gt;<i> not new, it predates my hiring by almost 2 years, it was just not
</I>&gt;<i> implemented.  Any initiatives who wish to come under the new committee
</I>&gt;<i> structure and which are active (active means they can demonstrate that they
</I>&gt;<i> are meeting or communicating regularly--regularly is defined by the context
</I>&gt;<i> each initiative has set for itself)  will send me their scope and host a
</I>&gt;<i> call for members.  If post that call for members the committee has met the
</I>&gt;<i> minimum guidelines they will be considered fully converted and expected to
</I>&gt;<i> follow the Committees 2.0 guidelines as well as have access to the benefits
</I>&gt;<i> of committees.  At that point we will ramp down and redundant structures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The hope is that by conforming to the official structures of OWASP there
</I>&gt;<i> will be less confusion about resources and therefore our community will be
</I>&gt;<i> more empowered to continue to develop.    The key here is that we are

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Bil,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This all sounds good, however, we already completed the first two thirds
</I>&gt;<i> of this process years ago. I would suggest that WIA's previous status as an
</I>&gt;<i> Initiative should give it status in moving forward with only the final
</I>&gt;<i> steps to become a committee. I doubt that the leaders list will want to
</I>&gt;<i> re-do all of the discussions from the past. It may make sense to renew the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion as a committee with the leaders list. Considering that WIA has
</I>&gt;<i> been operating with board approval for a long time, has a wiki page and
</I>&gt;<i> list already, we should only need to identify the 5 leaders to comply with
</I>&gt;<i> the new requirements, and let the community know about the transition. WIA
</I>&gt;<i> is *not* a new thing and should not have to start our from scratch, as if
</I>&gt;<i> it walked in off the street. At this point, we should simply focus on
</I>&gt;<i> compliance with the committee requirements and begin operating
</I>&gt;<i> appropriately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,

</I>&gt;<i> We definitely should organize as an official committee and I didn't see
</I>&gt;<i> anyone object to doing that.  To kick off the process, we need the
</I>&gt;<i> following two items:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We need someone who will send the committee formation email to
</I>&gt;<i> the OWASP Leaders List.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. For that email, we need the &quot;rationale and desired scope&quot; for the WIA
</I>&gt;<i> Committee.  We should hash that out here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Leaders list then discusses the formation of the committee.  I
</I>&gt;<i> recommend everyone here join the Leaders list so that you can contribute to
</I>&gt;<i> the discussion.  Assuming there are not major objections, it then goes to
</I>&gt;<i> the BoD for a vote.  Once the BoD approves, we then need at least five
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP members to join the newly formed committee (if you're not a OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> member, please join so you can help us here).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For reference, here is the official process for forming a committee:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At any point in time, a community member may propose a new committee via
</I>&gt;<i> the OWASP Leaders List stating their rationale and desired scope for
</I>&gt;<i> creating a new committee. After a community discussion, with perceived
</I>&gt;<i> majority support and no major arguments against, the OWASP Board of
</I>&gt;<i> Directors will establish whether there is a conflict of interest with any
</I>&gt;<i> existing committees and whether the formation of that committee is in line
</I>&gt;<i> with with OWASP goals. If no conflict is determined to exist, the Board
</I>&gt;<i> will initiate a public call for OWASP members interested in committee
</I>&gt;<i> membership, via the OWASP Community mailing list, with a seven day time
</I>&gt;<i> window. So long as the committee receives at least five OWASP members
</I>&gt;<i> applicants, the Board will vote on the committee creation. A majority vote
</I>&gt;<i> of support from the Board is sufficient for establishment of a new
</I>&gt;<i> committee with all OWASP member applicants being granted committee
</I>&gt;<i> membership.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since July 2014 OWASP has used Committees as the method for members to
</I>&gt;<i> drive global change in targeted areas.  Committees have the ability to make
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations to the board with a louder voice and request funds in a way
</I>&gt;<i> that general groups of people do not have access to.  Because the move from
</I>&gt;<i> initiatives to committees has not been facilitated previously, I propose
</I>&gt;<i> that we honor the work done by existing active initiatives by accelerating
</I>&gt;<i> the process which requires the leader's list show vocal support with no
</I>&gt;<i> strong objections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means that the Board will be given notice and a call for members will
</I>&gt;<i> be initiated. At this time anyone may join the committee.  This is a great
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to grow your committee attendance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are three types of members in a committee:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Voting members who are either founding members or invited to become
</I>&gt;<i> voting members after having been a participating member for at least 3
</I>&gt;<i> months.
</I>&gt;<i> 2)Participating members who are able to participate in the discussions and
</I>&gt;<i> activities of the committee but not vote
</I>&gt;<i> 3)Staff/Board members who are participating members with the added
</I>&gt;<i> restriction of not being able to lead the conversation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After the process is done, initiatives as they exist now will be totally
</I>&gt;<i> phased out.
