<PRE>My apologies ladies, I have had a few things come up and I no longer believe I will have the time to serve on the committee.  I wish you all the best of luck &#8211; and if there is anything I can do let me know.

Likewise, glad you're back Tiffany!

I've captured the two points into the agenda for the next meeting, we can discuss them.

Also, I've made the document editable instead of me having to accept changes.

It's a bit wonky now, since I accepted every change, please read through to make sure any changes you made are still how you want them.

Thanks,


- Bil

Dear All,

Last week when I was to submit your committee I became quite ill and had to take the rest of the week off.  This week I was in the staff summit each day.  I would like to submit you for a committee asap, preferably today.  I noticed that you edited the scope doc, so I will wait until you all tell me that it is in its agreed final form.

I, too, did some editing, but only for readability.  However, there are two points that I made comments on about content.  Clearly however the team decides to go will be totally supported, I just wanted to make sure that the conversation has been had.

I have individually noted the co leads and bil, who has written most of the doc, because I want to make sure that those most active in the doc see this email asap.

Best,
Tiffany

Thank you Bil,

Ok, I added a few updates. Let's add this to our next WIA meeting agenda for discussion. Best wishes.

Sincerely,
Bev

During the last WIA call, it was suggested that I put the draft of the WIA Purpose and Scope online for commenting.  You can see it here (you'll need to use your OWASP account):

<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1-cDEmeiYpaRbqWpgHW3LIGTT_4zqtfpUn1wS-lSSOZE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1-cDEmeiYpaRbqWpgHW3LIGTT_4zqtfpUn1wS-lSSOZE/edit?usp=sharing</A>

This scope will be used to form the WIA Committee, so it's important that it correctly reflect the scope of WIA.  I look forward to reading your comments.

Thanks,
