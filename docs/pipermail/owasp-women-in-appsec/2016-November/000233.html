<PRE>PS: Oh, and Emily, we should try to move these discussions to the WIA list:
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appsec_usa_women_in_security">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appsec_usa_women_in_security</A>
(especially if we want to be a &quot;compliant&quot; committee someday! LOL!)

&gt;<i> Thanks Emily,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can speak to the mentor initiative - which is already submitted and
</I>&gt;<i> organized as a committee - it has been an active initiative for about 2
</I>&gt;<i> years and currently 5 participating chapters. As soon as Tiffany gets the
</I>&gt;<i> committee setup with a wiki, we're all set. We already have an active
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list. The mentor committee includes everyone, so if WIA wants to
</I>&gt;<i> have a specialized mentor program just for women, WIA is most welcome to
</I>&gt;<i> participate as a committee with the Mentor Committee. We have our five
</I>&gt;<i> leaders, but recently one dropped, so we need to replace. Would be great to
</I>&gt;<i> have someone from WIA on the leadership of the Mentor Committee, too,
</I>&gt;<i> especially as a liaison. The Mentor Committee started a project about six
</I>&gt;<i> months ago called the Learning Gateway Project. It is also very active. All
</I>&gt;<i> of the Learning Gateway team members attend the monthly Mentor Initiative
</I>&gt;<i> (soon to be Committee) meetings which are held monthly, and posted to the
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP calendar. The next Mentor meeting is currently scheduled for 6pm
</I>&gt;<i> Thursday January 5, 2017. Everyone is welcome to attend. We hope that all
</I>&gt;<i> chapters will send at least one representative from their own local chapter
</I>&gt;<i> mentor programs, as well. We meet on gotomeeting, and all chapters are
</I>&gt;<i> welcome to participate. We also have our local mentor programs here in NY,
</I>&gt;<i> NJ, Long Island and Brooklyn, as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that it is a good idea to limit the time of WIA, so that may
</I>&gt;<i> be a good reason to &quot;not&quot; become a committee and remain an initiative. I
</I>&gt;<i> have expressed previously that I think that we should keep the initiatives,
</I>&gt;<i> and that initiatives should not be forced to become committees. I have not
</I>&gt;<i> seen any interest in the committees since they were presented a few years
</I>&gt;<i> ago. Most members are not interested in committees, but they will support
</I>&gt;<i> an initiative. I think that committees were someone's great idea that was
</I>&gt;<i> never discussed by the members, and was sort of &quot;handed down&quot; from above,
</I>&gt;<i> not really the way that OWASP is supposed to work. I find it amazing that
</I>&gt;<i> since the committee model was imposed, that no one, except myself, and more
</I>&gt;<i> recently, Andrew, has even attempted to create one. I think that the
</I>&gt;<i> committee model is fundamentally flawed and too complex for most people.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe staff have time for tiresome bureaucratic processes, and they are
</I>&gt;<i> paid for that sort of thing, but most professional volunteers really are
</I>&gt;<i> not interested, nor do we have time for such antics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes,
</I>&gt;<i> Bev

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The agenda doc is open for editing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is the doc with the notes from the planning meeting:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/15aW">https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/15aW</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have some questions (probably for Tiffany, but please chime in if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know!) about the proposed scope, which looks great by the way (thanks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bil!).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    1. What are our obligations for meeting each point in the scope?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       1. Do we have to meet each of the items within a certain period of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       time?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       2. What about breadth? If we say we're going to start a mentoring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       program and it only takes off in a couple areas of the country is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       sufficient?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    2. Can the scope change as the committee grows?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, just a thought: I don't think we should include the entire WIA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mailing list on threads like these. I don't want people to lose interest in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the group because they are receiving too many emails that they don't think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are relevant to them. I have some business cards for individuals who have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expressed interest in WIA to whom I would like send an invite to join the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> committee. I think the general mailing list should be reserved for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invitations to meetings, follow up meeting notes and general information,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i.e. information about AppSec 2017 WIA activities. We should also create a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> committee list, if we can, so that people on the committee can be a part of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these conversations and don't accidentally get dropped from a reply.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, I thought I was on the leaders list - I get emails with [OWASP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leaders] in the subject field - but I didn't see the email from Tiffany to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the board. Tiffany, is that the list you are including on the emails to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> board?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Emily
