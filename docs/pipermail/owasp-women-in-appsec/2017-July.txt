Hello WIA,

Below are the results from the 2017 elections.  The following people will
serve the remainder of the 2017 year in their positions.  We'll hold
elections again later this year for the 2018 calendar year.

Congratulations to the incoming leadership team!

We do have two candidates that won multiple positions, Cathy Hall for
Secretary and Treasurer, and Loredana Mancini for Vice Chair and Volunteer
Coordinator of Europe.  Since neither had an alternative candidate, I'll
let the incoming leadership team decide how they want to resolve it (e.g.
let them hold multiple positions, or try to fill a vacate position, etc.).

Until it's resolved, I'll hold off on updating the wiki with the elected
candidates.

Thanks and congrats!

- Bil

Dear WIA members,

We have a request to submit WIA activities request to the OWASP Event
Manager before July 10 for AppSecUSA WIA activities. I requested that the
date be extended to July 12 so that we can make decisions at our July 11
meeting. In any case, please share your preferences for WIA @ AppSecUSA
2017 activities and let's discuss them here before our meeting to get a
start on things.

I would like to propose:

1. A WIA Mentors luncheon - capacity 50 attendees

2. A room for WIAns and Mentors during the conference to spontaneously meet
- capacity 20

3. A WIA keynote speaker or panelist on one of the regular tracks and//or
panels

4. A WIA panel

5. A WIA Committee - Mentors Committee round table discussion meeting -
capacity 50

Any other suggestions?

Best wishes,
Bev

could be useful in order to get volunteers, bye Loredana

Great suggestions, Bev! I've done a lot of women in security panels and
wanted to expand on your panel idea. Perhaps we could find companies that
have decent representation (more than the industry average for security of
11% women or more than the industry average for IT of 20%) or are making
good improvements and ask them targeted questions on how they did it. This
would make a panel or talk more focused on actionable steps, instead of
just discussing the problem we know exists already. I'd be happy to help
find these companies or help with a panel/talk like this.

Another idea is inviting 3-5 local colleges to have CS/CE/EE professors
nominate a diverse student to give a 10/15-minute "first conference talk"
where they discuss a project, security trend, or research initiative. We
could provide mentors from our group to make sure they're successful, and
it's a great resume builder.

Just a few suggestions - happy to elaborate, will try to join the call on
the 11th.

These are all great ideas. I am trying to come up with others and so far
don't have anything solid to add.

For the panel discussion, my company, ThoughtWorks has worked very hard and
been successful at hiring women to the extent of being named last year's
winner of the Anita Borg Top Companies for Women Technologists. We are not
security specialists, but if you want to round out the panel as you
suggested, I am sure I could find someone who is willing to participate.

Dear Ashley, Loredana and Wendy,

Thank you! All of your comments are noted. OWASP Global says there is a
hard stop date of April 11th. Anyone up for a gotomeeting session to
finalize these concepts into a proposed plan? I'm available Friday
(tomorrow) afternoon NYC time. Anyone else?

Ashley, great concepts, would you be willing to take the lead on them and
work out luncheon details with Bil until our July 11 meeting?

Loredana, Great idea, I'll ask if we could have a WIA table also in the
expo and entrance areas, per your suggestion. Could you take the lead on
this until our meeting on July 11?

Wendy, could you prepare a plan for the panel and take the lead on that
until our next meeting on July 11th?

Ashley, Loredana and Wendy, Could you all write a brief description of your
above mentioned concepts that you will lead, send them back to this list by
July 7th (tomorrow), and we can add them to the below list for sending to
OWASP Global before the July10th deadline? Also, let me know if anyone is
available for a gotomeeting Sunday July 9th for a final discussion before
July 10th deadline. Also kindly plan to attend and give updates at the July
11th meeting.

Bil, could you consult with Ashley on the WIA mentor luncheon concepts Item
1 and 2? Meanwhile, I'll work on item 3 and 4.

Updated items follow with assignments:

1. A WIA Mentors luncheon - capacity 50 - 70 attendees (invite local
universities to participate Ashley and Bil taking lead)

2. A room for WIAns and Mentors during the conference to spontaneously meet
- capacity 20 - 30 (Have mentors scheduled to cover the room with their
activities for "drop ins". Ashley taking lead)

3. A WIA keynote speaker or panelist on one of the regular tracks and//or
panels - There are several women speaking at the conference already, invite
them to WIA activities. (Bev will look into speakers and invite to WIA
activities)

4. A WIA Committee - Mentors Committee round table discussion meeting -
capacity 50 - 60 (Bev taking lead)

5. A WIA panel - This was originally rejected by OWASP Global Staff,
however, I asked them to reconsider. I'd suggest focusing on the 1-4 for
now and if we get the panel, be prepared for it. (Wendy taking lead)

Feel free to call or Skype if you wish to discuss details. Thank you!

Best wishes,
Bev

PS: Typo alert: Correction to first paragraph as follows:
Thank you! All of your comments are noted. OWASP Global says there is a
hard stop date of April 10th. (Not 11th, therefore we need to try to
finalize as much as we can before July 9th in order to finalize and report
on July 10th to OWASP Global, and also report to WIA meeting on July 11th.)

Hello everyone,

Bev, thank you for taking the lead on this! 

I love all the ideas.  I have two more to add (below).  However, can we actually do all of them?  Do we have a budget for this (and if so, do we want to spend such a large percentage on one event)?  Do we have enough resources (hours and people) to do all of these activities?  If we have to choose, how do we choose?  Is there precedent for any of these questions?  I LOVE AppSec, but I don?t want that to be the only place we spend our donation dollars and our volunteer hours.  Women who are attending AppSec are already interested in what we do (which is awesome!) but we also want to attract new women.  I just want to make sure this is not our only focus.  There are many, many places that we can make a huge difference, this is just one of them.

That said?. 

Two more possible activities for AppSec USA:
Reaching out to a local female tech/programming group to do a coordinated pre-conference event, like they did at AppSec EU.  That was my favourite WIA event to date.  And I bet we made a huge impression on those women, women who were outside of our industry, who may one day decide to join our industry, because of that event.  Because this would be outside of AppSec the deadline would not apply?.  We could very easily find them some kick-ass AppSec speakers.  I volunteer to coordinate this activity and even be the speaker if need be.  If someone wants to help me that?s cool too!  Especially if they are local and know people.  Cost for this should be $0, as the meetup would be expected to host?. Or we could ask the local OWASP Chapter to help with this.
Reach out to the local school and teach a mini security lesson to kids or high school. If we could find an all-girls school, this would be ideal.  Again, this was a great idea that the AppSec EU people came up with.   I also think that this probably did not have a large cost?.

Perhaps we could find companies that have decent representation (more than the industry average for security of 11% women or more than the industry average for IT of 20%) or are making good improvements and ask them targeted questions on how they did it. This would make a panel or talk more focused on actionable steps, instead of just discussing the problem we know exists already. I'd be happy to help find these companies or help with a panel/talk like this.

Hi Tanya, I will send your activities to the OWASP Global team and cc: you.
Is there any interest in having a conference call on Saturday or Sunday to
finalize the details before July 10th? I don't know what is in the WIA
budget currently, and will look into that. I think that the conference
budget should cover some of the room costs, although the conference
committee and OWASP Global staff may feel differently. We will have to
cover any costs for the Mentor luncheon, so we will need sponsors for that.
I can cover the WIA Committee and Mentors Committee round table meeting if
AppSecUSA will cover the cost of the room. I'm also willing to put in a few
hours in the WIA room. Others should volunteer for their choices as well.
Best wishes, Bev

*IAVA Highlights She Who Borne The Battle at Meeting of "The Military
Coalition"*

*Coalition of 32 Leading Organizations Represent the Power of the Veterans
Community *

*Washington, DC (July 6, 2017) **-- *Today, IAVA's Director of
Intergovernmental and Political Affairs, Melissa Bryant, attended the
monthly meeting of The Military Coalition (TMC) in Washington. D.C. on
behalf of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA).

The Military Coalition is a group of 32 leading military, veterans, and
uniformed services organizations that meets monthly in the Washington D.C.
area to discuss shared priorities on behalf of their respective
organizations and memberships. The strong and dynamic coalition is a
unique, unified group of the true leaders in Washington driving veterans
policy. Together, TMC represents more than 5.5 million members of the
uniformed services--active, reserve, retired, survivors, veterans--and
their families. With a smaller percentage of Americans (and members of
Congress) having served than ever before, the role of TMC is more important
now than at any other time in history. For more on TMC click here
<http://click.mail.iava.org/?qs=9633c5774aa2ce9c9e9f54b45995e16ed1f2abc7200cd7ff85f4e8bd3584e415c89ad91801fb4f268d89f310eab5aa9e70757b9c08855e83>
.

This month, Bryant updated the group on IAVA's groundbreaking She Who Borne
the Battle
<http://click.mail.iava.org/?qs=c32d913bd776bcaa004e4ab45cff04f150dd1b79cb88b7d843da600af19c7c73982c5f0b9833c543ad016774d940887f8f5da917df9acfbf>
campaign to improve services and increase recognition for women veterans,
as well as shared the perspective of IAVA members on the Veterans
Administration budget and the future of its controversial "Choice" and
Community Care programs.

*She Who Borne The Battle:  More than 345,000 American women have deployed
since 9/11 and over 2.2 million women veterans live in the US total. Women
are the fastest-growing segment of the veteran population and that trend
will continue as the number of male veterans simultaneously declines over
the next decades. However, many women veterans are left without recognition
and the proper care to support their needs when they return from their
service. According to IAVA's Member Survey, only 27% of women veterans
respondents feel the public treats women veterans with respect. She Who
Borne the Battle will change this by providing a foundation of public
awareness, local support and policy changes solely targeted at recognizing
and supporting women veterans. This includes changing the exclusionary VA
motto, "To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,
and for his orphan," to a motto that represents "She Who Borne the Battle."

* IAVA is the leading voice of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in Washington
D.C. and communities nationwide. Led by veterans, our non-partisan advocacy
work ensures that Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and their families are
supported, protected and never forgotten. Since 2004, IAVA has been a
juggernaut in Washington D.C., creating and driving the national
conversation on issues ranging from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) to women
veteran issues to veteran unemployment.  IAVA's dedicated staff in
Washington, D.C. leads this work, advocating on behalf of our members
daily. We also train our member veterans to be powerful advocates for their
local community. IAVA is focused on results and has delivered historic
impacts. Every year since 2007, in an increasingly gridlocked political
environment and with an extremely limited operating budget, IAVA has passed
at least one major piece of groundbreaking legislation for our community
ranging from the Post-9/11 GI Bill (2008), to the VOW to Hire Heroes Act
(2011), to The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act
(2015).  See IAVA's Advocacy Program Digital Hub for the full list of

Hi all,

I can do a call tomorrow or over the weekend. I have some times I'm not available so maybe send out a doodle poll.

And yes, I can also take the lead on the panel until our next call.

Dear Ashley, Loredana and Wendy,

Thank you! All of your comments are noted. OWASP Global says there is a hard stop date of April 11th. Anyone up for a gotomeeting session to finalize these concepts into a proposed plan? I'm available Friday (tomorrow) afternoon NYC time. Anyone else? 

Ashley, great concepts, would you be willing to take the lead on them and work out luncheon details with Bil until our July 11 meeting?

Loredana, Great idea, I'll ask if we could have a WIA table also in the expo and entrance areas, per your suggestion. Could you take the lead on this until our meeting on July 11?

Wendy, could you prepare a plan for the panel and take the lead on that until our next meeting on July 11th?

Ashley, Loredana and Wendy, Could you all write a brief description of your above mentioned concepts that you will lead, send them back to this list by July 7th (tomorrow), and we can add them to the below list for sending to OWASP Global before the July10th deadline? Also, let me know if anyone is available for a gotomeeting Sunday July 9th for a final discussion before July 10th deadline. Also kindly plan to attend and give updates at the July 11th meeting.

Bil, could you consult with Ashley on the WIA mentor luncheon concepts Item 1 and 2? Meanwhile, I'll work on item 3 and 4.

Updated items follow with assignments:

1. A WIA Mentors luncheon - capacity 50 - 70 attendees (invite local universities to participate Ashley and Bil taking lead)

2. A room for WIAns and Mentors during the conference to spontaneously meet - capacity 20 - 30 (Have mentors scheduled to cover the room with their activities for "drop ins". Ashley taking lead)

3. A WIA keynote speaker or panelist on one of the regular tracks and//or panels - There are several women speaking at the conference already, invite them to WIA activities. (Bev will look into speakers and invite to WIA activities)

4. A WIA Committee - Mentors Committee round table discussion meeting - capacity 50 - 60 (Bev taking lead)

5. A WIA panel - This was originally rejected by OWASP Global Staff, however, I asked them to reconsider. I'd suggest focusing on the 1-4 for now and if we get the panel, be prepared for it. (Wendy taking lead)

Feel free to call or Skype if you wish to discuss details. Thank you!

Best wishes,
Bev

Perhaps we could find companies that have decent representation (more than the industry average for security of 11% women or more than the industry average for IT of 20%) or are making good improvements and ask them targeted questions on how they did it. This would make a panel or talk more focused on actionable steps, instead of just discussing the problem we know exists already. I'd be happy to help find these companies or help with a panel/talk like this.

We could provide mentors from our group to make sure they're successful, and it's a great resume builder.

Subject: [Women_in_security] Agenda for next meeting
Message-ID: <30DCE045-C4E5-48F8-A0E6-04C769014367@owasp.org>

Hello WIA members, this is Tanya Janca, your new chair.

I want to change the way we do things.  We are not just an organization that organizes female-friendly events for the AppSec conferences.  We will do much, much more.  This means partnering with other women?s organizations, letting many, many more people join us, media interaction and promotion, and having people run events, from small to large, mostly independently and locally.  If we expect the leadership of WIA to have a hand in each event, we will be too slow and limited.  Instead, WIA will provide leadership and support to the many things that our members will do.

I propose the following agenda for our meeting on Tuesday:
1) I will ask for volunteers to coordinate or perform key efforts (someone to approve mailing list messages, someone to lead the AppSec USA effort and someone for each event we want to do and someone to find a female speaker who will be attending c0c0n to do a talk for Shruthi as part of a WIA event).  We have many more key positions, but I will start with those for now as they are time-sensitive.  Please feel free to volunteer for these before the meeting by emailing me.  Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org
2) Talk about how I see us moving forward, with activities for all types of members to be active for us and with us.  I want us to be much, much more active at the local level.  I want us to have mini-tasks that anyone can do.  If someone wants to help, no matter who they are, I want them to have something to do.
3) Open Call for ideas moving forward, big and small.  You can email me these directly if you are shy or we run out of time: Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org
4) Homework.  The last 3-5 minutes of each WIA meeting I plan to give everyone optional ?homework? that they can consider doing between now and the next meeting.  Items will be something small, such as sharing an article you liked that woman wrote and then tweeting it at the WIA twitter feed.  Homework is always optional, it?s just an idea of something you can do to help for you to consider.

Thank you,

Tanya Janca
(Your new chair)

PS In the near future I will be looking for volunteers for the following, please let me know if you are interested:
1) someone to manage partnerships with other women?s groups, this means figuring out when to ask for help and how, plus maintaining a list of who wants to help us.  We have several offers and if you want we could have one person per partnership or one for all.
2) someone to maintain a list of female speakers who are talented and available/willing to do AppSec talks and mention WIA and OWASP, this person will put these women in touch with people looking for female speakers.  The speakers do not need to be members of WIA, but they *must* be OWASP positive/ethical/willing to mention OWASP at some point.  
3) men who are willing to do interviews or write an article about why they care about WIA and how it has a positive effect for both men and women when there are more women in AppSec.  I already have an online newspaper interested in doing an article.  Please contact me if you are interested in talking about your experiences!
4) women who are willing to do interviews or write articles that mention OWASP, AppSec, etc.  If you want to mention WIA too, that?s great, but just having female guests on a podcast would be a huge change at this point (many popular podcasts have one < 1 female guest per year).

I will send a brief description on the desk one later in the aftenoon

Hi all,

Some really good ideas, it's great to see so many.

Given the time constraints, i think it would be good to keep it simple this
year and not to overwhelm the attendees/ ourselves. It takes a lot of time
to organise each event.

Why not run a drinks/ food reception ( evening) and invite local women in
tech/ code groups ( we did this in the EU and it went great). We could hit
up some inspirational speakers to speak at this event. It should be open to
between 100-150 people.

We should also have a WIA committee meeting in person to speak about plans
etc for the next year (maybe dial in details for those who are not
attending in person).

What does everyone think, might be a good way to break the new roles in
while still having a really successful event. Then aim for bigger and
better next year (with a lot more time to plan).

My two cents.

Owen

Hi all,

On our list there is a plan to schedule a WIA Committee & Mentors Committee
roundtable, face to face meeting. After that meeting, we can have a WIA
Committee meeting, if you like. I doubt that the WIA & Mentors meeting will
take more than 30 to 45 minutes. We can have a networking break for 15
minutes and then WIA afterwards.

Please let me know what comes up with the Doodle Poll and will add send out
calendar invitation with gotomeeting details.

I think that it is a good idea to Mentor the new officers until they are
ready to do things on their own. I'm currently mentoring Tanya. Perhaps
Bil, Owen and others could mentor some of the other officers between now
and then.

We will be able to set up a WIA person at the registration table at
AppSecUSA. Who wants to do that? Do we want to print out some kind of
program insert about the WIA activities for AppSecUSA?

I think that AppSecUSA should cover most of WIA expenses as part of the
event budget. What do you think? They have in the past.

Best wishees,
Bev

Dear WIA Members,

Since it is already late on the East Coast USA for the Friday Doodle Poll
schedule, I recommend that we choose a time for Friday evening or Saturday
that works for most people.

Please make your selections for best meeting times before 5pm today for a
meeting this evening or tomorrow:
https://beta.doodle.com/poll/t884gzek5fbdffeu . Thank you.

Best wishes,
Bev

I'm on vacation, and am not keeping up with email.  Some random thoughts:

I believe WIA has some funds banked at OWASP Global, and I know my employer
sponsored the WIA luncheon, so those funds should also be available ($3500).

We can either use all of those funds for the proposed events, or we can
seek out more sponsors.

I agree with Owen, there's not a lot of time to plan for this year, so it
would be better to table some ideas for 2019.  That said, if we can
identify three (or more) people per idea to own the activity and are
committed to driving it for 2018, then that could work (assuming we have
the funds).

Sounds great Tanya, I can help with the WIA mailing list, liaison with
partners, events and liaison for WIA and Mentors Committee. We are planning
local WIA events in Brooklyn and interested in hosting a national WIA event
here in NYC if there is interest in 2018. Cheers, Bev

Here is an initial draft for the panel proposal.

 ----

It is well known that there are a disproportionately low number of women in IT and an even lower number who focus on security. Despite these low numbers, some organizations have been very successful in recruiting and retaining women.

What can we learn from these organizations to attract more women to security and other technical professions thereby increasing the number of women in our fields.

And in the meantime, can we use some of the proven techniques to make our own companies more attractive to and a better home for women technologists.

This panel will export these and other questions from the audience. There will be an opportunity to submit questions ahead of time to give panelists a chance to prepare deeper answers. Questions from the floor will also be addressed if there is time.

A few candidate panelists are:

ThoughtWorks
Winner of 2016 Anita Borg Top Tech Companies for Women.
https://www.thoughtworks.com/news/2016-top-companies-for-women-technologists
contact - Wendy Istvanick

Carnegie Mellon University 
Repeatedly enrolls a higher percentage of women.
http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2016/september/undergrad-women-engineering-computer-science.html
contact - TBD

A security focused panelist.

Local ABI Chapter - ABI.Atlanta is closest

Other possibilities from this list. Does anyone have contacts at any of these?

Hi Tanya, Bev,

In the Dublin chapter we're also planning an event in the next few months with the local ISC2 & ISACA chapters to make an impact. The aim would be to influence the local community to seek out female hires and aim for diverse security teams that shift more towards a gender balance rather than the current status quo.

This event will be a follow on from a meeting we had in May last year on 'attracting & retaining women in security' where we had 250 attendees, 2 excellent speakers and a very interesting panel discussion. We had the event recorded and it resonated strongly with the community. We're keen for the next event to do more than highlight the issue and are looking at having an Information Security project competition for different education levels (primary, secondary and third level) for females that will be judged by females to highlight the talent in the industry. We're also trying to get some local companies (Dublin is EMEA HQ for most technology multinationals) to commit to training, internships and to commit to diversity within security teams. We don't want to limit it to "appsec" as the issue is broader and extends to all areas of security.

If it helps, I'm happy to write an article about why it's important to have more female colleagues in security. 

We changed our chapter board structure a while back and made it mandatory to have a female presence on the board. I think that is one reason we getting bigger number attending meetings now.

We would love to hear thoughts from the WIA committee on what has worked for other events or initiatives that have worked and would be happy to support the Brooklyn 2018 event in any way we can. 


Kind Regards,

Tony

OWASP Dublin Chapter

>>> I want to change the way we do things.  We are not just an organization that organizes female-friendly events for the AppSec conferences.  We will do much, much more.  This means partnering with other women?s organizations, letting many, many more people join us, media interaction and promotion, and having people run events, from small to large, mostly independently and locally.  If we expect the leadership of WIA to have a hand in each event, we will be too slow and limited.  Instead, WIA will provide leadership and support to the many things that our members will do.
>>> 
>>> I propose the following agenda for our meeting on Tuesday:
>>> 1) I will ask for volunteers to coordinate or perform key efforts (someone to approve mailing list messages, someone to lead the AppSec USA effort and someone for each event we want to do and someone to find a female speaker who will be attending c0c0n to do a talk for Shruthi as part of a WIA event).  We have many more key positions, but I will start with those for now as they are time-sensitive.  Please feel free to volunteer for these before the meeting by emailing me.  Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org
>>> 2) Talk about how I see us moving forward, with activities for all types of members to be active for us and with us.  I want us to be much, much more active at the local level.  I want us to have mini-tasks that anyone can do.  If someone wants to help, no matter who they are, I want them to have something to do.
>>> 3) Open Call for ideas moving forward, big and small.  You can email me these directly if you are shy or we run out of time: Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org
>>> 4) Homework.  The last 3-5 minutes of each WIA meeting I plan to give everyone optional ?homework? that they can consider doing between now and the next meeting.  Items will be something small, such as sharing an article you liked that woman wrote and then tweeting it at the WIA twitter feed.  Homework is always optional, it?s just an idea of something you can do to help for you to consider.
>>> 
>>> Thank you,
>>> 
>>> Tanya Janca
>>> (Your new chair)
>>> 
>>> PS In the near future I will be looking for volunteers for the following, please let me know if you are interested:
>>> 1) someone to manage partnerships with other women?s groups, this means figuring out when to ask for help and how, plus maintaining a list of who wants to help us.  We have several offers and if you want we could have one person per partnership or one for all.
>>> 2) someone to maintain a list of female speakers who are talented and available/willing to do AppSec talks and mention WIA and OWASP, this person will put these women in touch with people looking for female speakers.  The speakers do not need to be members of WIA, but they *must* be OWASP positive/ethical/willing to mention OWASP at some point.  
>>> 3) men who are willing to do interviews or write an article about why they care about WIA and how it has a positive effect for both men and women when there are more women in AppSec.  I already have an online newspaper interested in doing an article.  Please contact me if you are interested in talking about your experiences!
>>> 4) women who are willing to do interviews or write articles that mention OWASP, AppSec, etc.  If you want to mention WIA too, that?s great, but just having female guests on a podcast would be a huge change at this point (many popular podcasts have one < 1 female guest per year).

Hi Wendy,

Thank you for preparing this. It is a great panel concept. Unfortunately,
so far, OWASP Global has refused to allow us to have a panel for this
year's AppSecUSA, however, I have asked them to reconsider, but so far, the
answer is still "no". I'm very disappointed in this because Bil and I both
reached out to the AppSecUSA Committee months ago to request WIA
programming be included in the AppSecUSA event. Only recently did we
receive a response from the Event Organizer informing us that programming
was already decided and WIA not included. They agreed that we could plan
programming and submit our request by the July 10th deadline. We were also
informed that there are women speakers. I requested their information so
that we could make them aware of WIA activites and invite them, and other
speakers, to participate if interested. I have so far received no response.
Of course, I protested this "selective" and what I consider "dismissive"
treatment by OWASP Global to the WIA committee and requested that there be
a change in the current process as I do not believe that it alligns well
with the OWASP Board's strategy for the OWASP Foundation. In any case, at
this stage, instead of putting any more efforts into a panel at this event,
perhaps you might be willing to focus on inviting the current speakers on
the current program to participate in the WIA activities? What are your
thoughts? Also, we need someone who is willing to take responsibility for
the WIA seat at the AppSecUSA registration desk. Would you be willing to
take responsibility for that? We can work on having a WIA panel at
AppSecUSA and EU 2018, and submit our sincere disappointment about the way
that things were handled this year to the OWASP BoD. There is also a
Leaders Review Group that anyone is welcome to join where we review things
like this. I will add this item to our list for discussion among other
leaders at the leaders reviews meetings. Thank you and best wishes.

Sincerely,
Bev

I can reply more later - but yes I can take on the reg desk seat - seems to fit well as the volunteer coordinator.

If I recall this means I won't have to pay for conference but have to cover my flight and hotel, right?

Hi Wendy, I'm not sure about the details for the conference. Best to ask
Tiffany about those details. I'm not sure if committee officers are
considered the same as chapter leaders and project leaders, but it makes
sense if they are, so I hope so. Best wishes, Bev

Nice work Tony!  Truly impressive, thank you for sharing, and for doing all of that!!!

Agreeing to write an article Ould be really, really great.  Thank you.  I will put you in touch with the newspaper.  I think it might be fun to have a few men on the article.  Could I put you in touch with the newspaper and then send other men your way who are willing to help?   I feel like having the perspective of multiple men (especially if they have different reasons) might make for an even better story.

We had the event recorded and it resonated strongly with the community. We're keen for the next event to do more than highlight the issue and are looking at having an Information Security project competition for different education levels (primary, secondary and third level) for females that will be judged by females to highlight the talent in the industry. We're also trying to get some local companies (Dublin is EMEA HQ for most technology multinationals) to commit to training, internships and to commit to diversity within security teams. We don't want to limit it to "appsec" as the issue is broader and extends to all areas of security.

>> I want to change the way we do things.  We are not just an organization that organizes female-friendly events for the AppSec conferences.  We will do much, much more.  This means partnering with other women?s organizations, letting many, many more people join us, media interaction and promotion, and having people run events, from small to large, mostly independently and locally.  If we expect the leadership of WIA to have a hand in each event, we will be too slow and limited.  Instead, WIA will provide leadership and support to the many things that our members will do.
>> 
>> I propose the following agenda for our meeting on Tuesday:
>> 1) I will ask for volunteers to coordinate or perform key efforts (someone to approve mailing list messages, someone to lead the AppSec USA effort and someone for each event we want to do and someone to find a female speaker who will be attending c0c0n to do a talk for Shruthi as part of a WIA event).  We have many more key positions, but I will start with those for now as they are time-sensitive.  Please feel free to volunteer for these before the meeting by emailing me.  Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org <mailto:Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org>
>> 2) Talk about how I see us moving forward, with activities for all types of members to be active for us and with us.  I want us to be much, much more active at the local level.  I want us to have mini-tasks that anyone can do.  If someone wants to help, no matter who they are, I want them to have something to do.
>> 3) Open Call for ideas moving forward, big and small.  You can email me these directly if you are shy or we run out of time: Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org <mailto:Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org>
>> 4) Homework.  The last 3-5 minutes of each WIA meeting I plan to give everyone optional ?homework? that they can consider doing between now and the next meeting.  Items will be something small, such as sharing an article you liked that woman wrote and then tweeting it at the WIA twitter feed.  Homework is always optional, it?s just an idea of something you can do to help for you to consider.
>> 
>> Thank you,
>> 
>> Tanya Janca
>> (Your new chair)
>> 
>> PS In the near future I will be looking for volunteers for the following, please let me know if you are interested:
>> 1) someone to manage partnerships with other women?s groups, this means figuring out when to ask for help and how, plus maintaining a list of who wants to help us.  We have several offers and if you want we could have one person per partnership or one for all.
>> 2) someone to maintain a list of female speakers who are talented and available/willing to do AppSec talks and mention WIA and OWASP, this person will put these women in touch with people looking for female speakers.  The speakers do not need to be members of WIA, but they *must* be OWASP positive/ethical/willing to mention OWASP at some point.  
>> 3) men who are willing to do interviews or write an article about why they care about WIA and how it has a positive effect for both men and women when there are more women in AppSec.  I already have an online newspaper interested in doing an article.  Please contact me if you are interested in talking about your experiences!
>> 4) women who are willing to do interviews or write articles that mention OWASP, AppSec, etc.  If you want to mention WIA too, that?s great, but just having female guests on a podcast would be a huge change at this point (many popular podcasts have one < 1 female guest per year).

Hi all,

For those who don't know me, I am the new (volunteer) Media Relations
Coordinator. I am Dublin based and even though I've previously on the LATAM
communities I am still new in the European and USA ones (I promise I will
introducing myself on our next meeting).

I suggest we start by organising ourselves first. It is important to work
as a team, but most importantly to know which team are we part of. So far I
love Tanya's idea, but in order to get WIA to more women and more women
into WIA, we need to know where all these women are. I think we need to
start by documenting the different WIA communities (EU, USA, LATAM, etc).
The wiki should have a "local" leader, a how to and point of contact.

As mentioned before and in previous emails, it's also important to put the
WIA name out there so papers, interviews, videos, etc are a great idea to
start with. I think the best way we can get more women interested in cyber
security is by being role models, rather than promoting events. (twice a
month publications, a women news feed, the speakers contact list and so
on).

Finally, I think we need to connect and work as a team with the other women
communities/ projects: Women who code, Geek girls, etc..

Regards,
Kat

P.S. Tony: Looking forward to meeting you. :)

Subject: [Women_In_AppSec] IOS CTF for WIA
Message-ID: <CFA57166-2597-452D-B544-6892D185B05F@owasp.org>

Hello all,

I?ve met someone who is offering to run a CTF for WIA on ISO (hacking iPhones).  I do not know the details.  I am thinking that if he ran it online, that perhaps we could convince a few women from around the world to form teams to compete and invite women with little-to-no-experience to join them.  I am looking for someone to run this, and I will coach you through it and promise to participate with an all female team in Ottawa and will help promote it.

Do I have any volunteers?  We could even have a few of you running it together.  You can plan it whenever you and Swaroop decide to make it happen.  

Email me directly, not the whole channel.  In case it wasn?t clear this can be a man or women led project, anyone who wants to help is welcome.  Thank you everyone.

Tanya

Hi Tanya, You might want to ask Tom about this. I think that one of his
projects, the Virtual Village can do online CTFs, but not sure. Try
reaching out to Tom and Evin from the OWASP NY Chapter. Best wishes, Bev

Hi Kat,

Looking forward to meeting you too, we'll have an event in the local chapter soon probably August 3rd so hopefully you're free and can attend.

Kind Regards,

Tony

So far I love Tanya's idea, but in order to get WIA to more women and more women into WIA, we need to know where all these women are. I think we need to start by documenting the different WIA communities (EU, USA, LATAM, etc). The wiki should have a "local" leader, a how to and point of contact.

I think the best way we can get more women interested in cyber security is by being role models, rather than promoting events. (twice a month publications, a women news feed, the speakers contact list and so on).

We had the event recorded and it resonated strongly with the community. We're keen for the next event to do more than highlight the issue and are looking at having an Information Security project competition for different education levels (primary, secondary and third level) for females that will be judged by females to highlight the talent in the industry. We're also trying to get some local companies (Dublin is EMEA HQ for most technology multinationals) to commit to training, internships and to commit to diversity within security teams. We don't want to limit it to "appsec" as the issue is broader and extends to all areas of security.

This means partnering with other women?s organizations, letting many, many more people join us, media interaction and promotion, and having people run events, from small to large, mostly independently and locally.  If we expect the leadership of WIA to have a hand in each event, we will be too slow and limited.  Instead, WIA will provide leadership and support to the many things that our members will do.

We have many more key positions, but I will start with those for now as they are time-sensitive.  Please feel free to volunteer for these before the meeting by emailing me.  Tanya.Janca at OWASP.org

Items will be something small, such as sharing an article you liked that woman wrote and then tweeting it at the WIA twitter feed.  Homework is always optional, it?s just an idea of something you can do to help for you to consider.

>>>>>> 2) someone to maintain a list of female speakers who are talented and available/willing to do AppSec talks and mention WIA and OWASP, this person will put these women in touch with people looking for female speakers.  The speakers do not need to be members of WIA, but they *must* be OWASP positive/ethical/willing to mention OWASP at some point.  
>>>>>> 3) men who are willing to do interviews or write an article about why they care about WIA and how it has a positive effect for both men and women when there are more women in AppSec.  I already have an online newspaper interested in doing an article.  Please contact me if you are interested in talking about your experiences!
>>>>>> 4) women who are willing to do interviews or write articles that mention OWASP, AppSec, etc.  If you want to mention WIA too, that?s great, but just having female guests on a podcast would be a huge change at this point (many popular podcasts have one < 1 female guest per year).

Subject: [Women_In_AppSec] WIA Update from your Chair
Message-ID: <1CC401E7-6337-4170-8422-D577A280217C@owasp.org>

Hello all,

As your chair, I have made some decisions that I think you should all be aware of.  I am also looking for some volunteers.

Decisions:
There will be no mentoring lunch at AppSec USA, as there is no volunteer to lead it.  We will concentrate on the WIA Hang Out room instead.  We will be making it the coolest place at the conference to be.  I?ve already got several speakers who have agreed to stop by. 
There will be no ?in person? meeting at AppSec USA for WIA.  We will have it online the week after.  As most of us will not be attending the event, they will miss out, and the people who are there need to ?work? the WIA Hang Out room and also I want them to attend the conference and learn.  We can accomplish much more with a virtual meeting the following week.  
I don?t want us to have all of our conversations on the mailing list anymore, I want us to have a slack Channel.  I think Wendy created one for Bev and I before?.  I want us to have a slack channel and have our discussions are there from then on.  I will let you all know when it?s ready.  The mailing list is when there is something big that we need to say to everyone.  I am looking for a volunteer to create and administer the slack channel, please email me if you are willing to take this on.
We are going start a monthly WIA News Letter, so that people who are interested but who do not want to be on the committee can still help us and see what we are up to.  I am looking for a volunteer to do this.  Email me if you are interested.  We will list all of the WIA or WIA-friendly events in this, and anything else we think people might like to know, plus ?homework? for people to do to help our cause in their own life.
I plan to push AppSec USA very hard to give free admittance to people who have filled the forms to volunteer for AppSec USA for WIA.  Please list WIA in your application form.  If you already filled it and didn?t put that please give me your name so I know and I can talk to them.
I do not plan to pay all-expense-trips to AppSec for anyone out of the WIA budget.  If this was previously unclear, I apologize.  If you have other funding and are very close to being able to attend but not quite, we can talk.  Please email me directly about this if need be.  I can also give you ideas of how you can try to find funds for yourself via various means.
We are going to make a WIA website, which will let people sign up for the news letter, and see a link to our twitter feed.  We will expand it as need be, and we hope to have it ready before AppSec USA.  


Questions I have for all of you (please reply in emails directly to me, not the mailing list).
Who plans to attend AppSec USA this year?  I need to know who will be there to help run the WIA Room.
Who wants to work on the News Letter?
Who wants to work on the slack channel?
Who needs help sorting out their volunteer forms?

Thank you all,

Tanya

Hi Tanya,

Regarding the Slack channel I think we can use the OWASP #WIA channel. I've
signed up and looks like there are people still connected and talking
there. But we need to let people know it exits, something I think we can
via the newsletter.

As for the newsletter, I would love to lead that part, I used to lead the
Spanish version of the Debian News Project. I think I can take over this.
If you like the idea, I can start working on our first one as well as a way
to get news, edit and publish them.

I don't have plans on attending AppSec USA as it is on the other side of
the globe, but any help with the website, give me a shout. :)

I think the newsletter and website are a great idea. We need to make us
notice, but most importantly let more women where and whom to contact if
they want to join us.

Thanks,
Kat

Hi Vandy,

This is the URL: http://owasp.slack.com/. You need to create and account.
Once there, use the add channel option to search and add #WIA.

Thanks Bil,

For the record, it is also listed on the WIA Committee Agenda & Notes
Document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17r1btFUoSwxxL1hLnTmse9MY5t_5fWWmAr032gR5qrU/edit?usp=sharing

This shared Google document is where the WIA Committee meeting notes and
log can be found. The link is also in the WIA Committee Calendar
invitations.

I sort of forgot about that earlier today. Thanks for reminding me, Bil.

Best wishes,
Bev

Please share this on the WIA list if you deem appropriate. It would be
rather simple for the committee to apply for 30k for the WIA
https://www.eset.com/us/pitchfest/ with a clear mission

Appreciate your valuable time.

Hi all

I think it interesting, if there are no specific rules against this
participation in OWASP, I think we could try, bye Loredana.

Hello all,

Why are we applying for 30K?  What do we need this for?  Why are we not being self sufficient?  Please explain.

I think funds from anywhere would be good to get for WIA. I understand your
comment about being self sufficient but in the end that means hitting up
sponsors.

In the end the more money we have the more we can do, like sending people
to speak at major conferences or even to day events like what was run in
Dublin last year. We should also maybe look in to getting SWAG for sending
to these events (Stickers are always good)

We might need to gauge the effort required to apply for the funds.

I can see that the URL inserts /ca/ into it so the offer is obviously restricted geographically. Us poor Canadians are not allowed to see it. I suppose I could get my VPN set up but it's always 50/50 as to whether it will work, so I will just let it go. 

Maybe someone can forward a screenshot?

Hi everyone,

$30,000 would equal 600 new memberships for OWASP.  Whatever project we did with that money would need to provide something that they felt had similar value to them as an organization.  If someone would like to volunteer to write up a proposal with a plan the committee officers can review, assuming we approve of the plan and proposal, that volunteer can run with it.  

In fact, if anyone would like to run a WIA project, such as planning an event locally at your chapter, please tell us about it so we can help you promote it and you can put WIA all over it.  

To try to help set future expectations: The WIA committee officers will not be offering to run events, projects or other initiatives for other groups, if you suggest something for WIA, it is highly likely we will help you find volunteers or promote your event, but it is highly unlikely that we will offer to run it for you.  

If someone would like to volunteer to lead this please let me know.

Tanya

Isn't Cathy on the WIA list? Isn't it better to just mail to the list so
that everyone can follow?

Hi Bev,

I would say the problem with the list is that we end up discussing those
subjects here, which can be quite hard to track down.

Subject: [Women_In_AppSec] $30K
Message-ID: <36CDC39A-4574-448E-ABBF-91AA5832B194@owasp.org>

Hello all,

I must apologize.  I had not read the entire digest of the WIA meeting notes yesterday morning and when I saw that the discussion I had assumed that we were asking for $30K from OWASP, which I felt seemed like quite a lot considering the size of OWASP?s entire overall operating budget.  Also, the link did not work for me so I couldn?t read it, but luckily I can run myself through a proxy and can now see the details when I am more away this morning.

For those who also can?t see what the page says because of their geographic location, it is sort of like a contest for non-profits to pitch an idea to ask for $20,000 (not $30K), based on one of 4 categories (one of them being Women in Cyber Security).  I have made screenshots and can email them to anyone who wants to see what the page is supposed to look like.

Now that I understand better (again, sorry for jumping to conclusions), I definitely think we should apply.  Would someone like to volunteer to write this up?  I have some ideas we could go over about direction we could go with our application.

Lastly, I have CCed Tiffany, as 1) the person who applies needs to live in the USA and 2) the person who applies needs to work for OWASP.  Tiffany, if we write it up could you submit it?  

Tanya

Hi Tanya, Good idea. I think that it makes good sense to request Tiffany,
Kelly, an OWASP staffer or BoDs to apply for this. We hope in the future to
refine our organizational processes to allow Committee Officers and Chapter
Leaders to do these types of things, too, with permission of the board. It
only makes sense with the small size of our staff, since they are often
very busy, so may be difficult, but worth a try, IMHO. Best wishes, Bev

kindly provide more context? What do you mean by "track down"? Best wishes,

Hello,

I'd like it if everyone can email Katherine directly so she is aware that
they have an activity that they would like to have tracked.  Many things go
on in the mailing list , and I don't want her to be expected to read
people's minds as to if it's an initiative they want to go forward with.
Sometimes things aren't clear on the mailing list.  If someone emails her
directly then it will be clear, and if it's not she can ask them.  Does
this help?  I want to avoid confusion, and also not have long lengthy
discussions on the mailing list.

Tanya

Hi Tanya, Will Kathryn make the list available to the list members on a
regular basis so that we are aware of them, as well? I think that it is
expected of OWASP for transparency and inclusiveness to keep everyone on
the committee updated, too. Best wishes, Bev

It'll be on the agenda.  And the meeting notes should cover what was
discussed or decided upon.

Hi Tanya,

We already have three volunteer coordinators based on geographic location:


   1. Vandana Verma (Asia)
   2. Loredana Mancini (Europe)
   3. Wendy Istvanick (North America)


I suggest adding the project coordinator role to the wiki with the job
description, similar to the other roles listed here:

Hi all,

Yes, we are trying to define the best way for us to receive, organise and
define our next initiatives, and yes, transparency is important. Anyhow,
the idea is not to keep new ideas/ suggestions in secret, but organise the
different subjects for the next meeting. This will allow us to have an
agenda and document/ track everyone's comments/ opinions... maybe even vote
for them.

Sounds great, It is good to have discussions on the list, too, so that
everyone can participate. Cheers, Bev

- Broadcast LIVE from Las Vegas during Black Hat 2017 -
Cybersecurity investment has gone through the roof in recent years. Yet,
there is a global shortage of qualified professionals to fill a growing
number of open cybersecurity roles. According to a recent study by Frost &
Sullivan, the global cybersecurity workforce will be short by around 1.8
million people by 2022.

How do organizations cope with the growing demand for security
professionals, especially in an age of ever-expanding attack surface and
more frequent and sophisticated cyber attacks?

Join this live video panel of experts as they discuss the current trends
shaping the cybersecurity industry, the need for diversity and inclusion,
and strategies enterprises can employ to stay ahead of the game.

Message-ID: <8D44988F-972E-4D63-9987-EB09B5AAA81D@owasp.org>

Hello all,

I am resigning as chair of WIA.  I am currently in discussions with the WIA committee officers to see if any of them would like to take over the position of chair, if none of them are interested we will have to hold another election.  I will try to resolve this as fast as possible so as to not interrupt any of the current activities that are under way.  If anyone is interested in stepping up in the short term to fill this role, please let me know.

Thank you,
Tanya Janca

Dear all,

I know that leadership is currently in flux and that the person
coordinating AppSec USA has left.  Normally I would like for the committee
to focus on deciding jointly the structure you would prefer, but we have
some contracts out for the event and I really need a point person to
discuss those deliverables.

Can the committee help decide that this week?

Best,

Hi Tiffany,

I think Kat ccd would be a great lead and she would have my backing for
chair.

In the mean time I'd say it would be worth finding out who is going to be
at appsec USA and trying to coordinate through them.

Can those going reply to this mail?

I just had the wia meeting canceled from my calendar?  What happened?

@Wendy, I would normally love the idea of waiting a week, but with the
event 8 weeks away and the date for closing the room order set for cob
friday, I am afraid we cannot do that.   I am sorry.

Hi Tiffany, The meeting was moved to this Friday, noon. Hope that you can
make it. Please feel free to start the meeting if I'm late. It is a travel
day for me so I may not make it. Hope that you can all work out details,
find us a new leader. We'll reschedule next meeting after this one. Maybe
you all prefer to meet weekly until things settle down? Best wishes, Bev

That's fine. Depending on the time I may or may not be able to attend the
meeting.

However, I still plan on taking the lead on the WIA hang out room and
getting volunteers for the table at registration.

@wendy, if you are the volunteer coordinator in US and willing to take on
the USA events, perhaps we can answer the questions through email? Would
that make it easier on you while you travel?

Best,
Tiffany

It looks like I was typing as you sent that email.  Sorry.  I will send you
an email discussing the plans that we had or can chat with you in IST
tonight or tomorrow if you wish (although I do not want to disturb your
travel if you would prefer to be let alone).

Best,
Tiffany

That is fine, I'll try to keep up while on the road. Feel free to send
along whatever, and cc: Wendy, I think that it is great if she can take the
lead on that, but I can send you what we decided so far, and we'll find
someone to take the things that Tanya was going to cover on Friday, then
send that to you too. I hope that I can start the meeting on Friday, would
be nice if someone could back me up on that.

Oh, I am sorry, the previous email was aimed at Wendy. Tanya and I also had
a call on Friday discussing the plans for WIA.  :)

 However, which of the chapter leader accounts do you use, this will let me
start the call.

Best,
Tiffany

That works.

I am in India for work so I'm not really relaxing. I'm just not sure of
call timings, especially since I am already trying to fight off jet lag and
the general stomach issues I face when in India.

Sorry I was unable to attend the meeting given my current time zone.

Is there anything you need from me in the next few days? 

I am planning on working up a schedule for the room in the next days, that said I only have names for a few folks right now interested in helping out so if anyone knows of anyone else interested or how we can get volunteers from the general pool that will be helpful. 

Wendy


I'll be back in the US Thursday and promise to be more responsive after that.

@wendy, if you are the volunteer coordinator in US and willing to take on the USA events, perhaps we can answer the questions through email? Would that make it easier on you while you travel?

Hi Wendy, It sounds good. In the meeting Zoe Braiterman was elected as the
Chair to carry forward Tanya's role until elections next year. I have added
Zoe to this discussion. We can schedule a meeting to go over the schedule
with WIA officers, if you like? Or you can schedule it too. Just let the
officers know when you want to meet to go over the schedule. Best way to do
that is to post to the WIA list since anyone can attend anyway. I'm always
happy to help if it is difficult for you to do. We can meet at our regular
time on Friday if you like? How about noon on Friday? Best wishes, Bev

Hi Again Wendy, I just sent out a calendar invitation for Friday when you
return at 11am to noon. We'll try to do what we can then, hopefully, it is
a good time for most. I'd suggest to just save that weekly11am to noon
meeting time for any needed WIA Committee - AppSecUSA Planning Discussions
between now and AppSecUSA. Best wishes, Bev
