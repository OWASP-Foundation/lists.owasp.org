<PRE>Sorry to intrude on your mail list but I need to let the [owasp-women-in-appsec] members know that the OWASP Foundation is shutting down all the mail lists run by Mailman on lists.owasp.org on March 22, 2019.

Here is a one-click link to join the new Google Group which is replacing this list:
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/wia-committee/join">https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/wia-committee/join</A>

The new Group is also available online at:
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/wia-committee">https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/wia-committee</A>

Detailed Information on how join the Group is at <A HREF="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA</A>

NOTE:  You are not required to have a Google account, an @owasp.org email address, or to provide your phone number to join and participate in the new wia-committee Group - just an email address.

Finally, full details on the plan to retire Mailman, links and FAQs are  at: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL</A>

Thanks for your past and future contributions to our community!
