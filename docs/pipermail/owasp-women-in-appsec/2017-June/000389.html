<PRE>A few updates:

1.  So far we do not have anyone running for Chair.  Please let me know if
you are eligible, interested and can make the commitment.

2.  We could use more candidates for the other roles.

3.  I've put the duties on the wiki.  Take a look as I've made two
changes.  The first is moving the responsibility of setting up meetings on
the Vice-Chair, otherwise it felt a bit too light.  The second is adding
duties to the media relations coordinator, which we haven't discussed in
the past, so I made it up, but it was a top-of-my-head effort and could
probably use some editing.  You can read it here:

4. A reminder that you have until Friday to self-nominate.  If you want to
nominate someone else, please get their permission first.

Thanks!
