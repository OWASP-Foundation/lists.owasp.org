<PRE>[Please respond by Friday, June 23.]

The officers of WIA consist of the Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, and
Treasurer.  We also need a volunteer coordinator and a media relations
coordinator.

Below are the nominees from a few months ago.  Please review and let me
know if you want to be added or removed for consideration.  I'll move
forward with a vote once we've allowed everyone to put their name forward.

Note that for Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer, you must be a
Voting Member.  For the two coordinators, any participating member may fill
the position.

The membership list is here of Voting Members and Participating Members:
