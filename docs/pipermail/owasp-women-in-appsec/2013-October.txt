Hello team,

Just in case you don't know, Nancy Lornston and Carrie Schapter, the two
woman finalists we have selected
<http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-women-in-application-security-appsec-program/>have
both accepted the award and are going to the conference.

I look forward to meeting you and them at AppSec USA.

Good job, team!

Helen Gao
