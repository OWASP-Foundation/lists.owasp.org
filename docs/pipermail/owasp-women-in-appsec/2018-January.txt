Africom Develops New Tool to Measure Women?s Progress

By Brenda Law and Cori Fleser

U.S. Africa Command

STUTTGART, Germany, Jan. 12, 2018 ? U.S. Africa Command has developed a new
tool designed to measure progress in advancing women, peace and security as
part of its security cooperation effort.

The WPS Security Force Assistance assessment tool establishes criteria to
help Africom have a more informed understanding of how an African partner
nation implements WPS within its capacity and capability building
activities.

The SFA assessment tool is the brainchild of Africom?s gender advisor, Cori
Fleser.

?In my role as the gender advisor, I am responsible for providing
recommendations to staff at the command for implementing WPS within our
security cooperation activities,? said Fleser. ?I developed this tool as a
method for informing my understanding to provide more tailored
recommendations into that annual planning process.?

With the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017 signed into U.S. law in
October, Africom looked for new and innovative ways to integrate women,
peace and security into one of its core mission areas: security cooperation.

Since 2011, the command has worked to integrate the mandate in its
activities with African security forces. Annual training courses sponsored
by Africom and conducted for African partners consistently have only male
participants. Consequently, Africom saw the need to develop specific
training opportunities specifically for women from African militaries.
Beyond such skilled areas as communications and intelligence, the command
has cohosted workshops and seminars on gender integration

.

Despite these successes, integrating women, peace and security into
existing military planning, execution, and assessment processes, such as
those for security cooperation, has been more of a challenge, which
inspired Fleser to develop the SFA assessment tool.

*Assessing Women, Peace, Security Implementation*

Informed by the Defense Department?s Implementation Guide for Women, Peace
and Security, the tool defines women, peace and security-related criteria
within DoD?s doctrinally defined security force functions and identifies
proxy indicators measured in data sets and global indices that can be used
to make an informed assessment of that specific criteria.

The tool leverages open source data sets from international organizations
such as the United Nations, World Bank, and World Health Organization, and
uses indicators from global indices, such as the Fragile States Index and
Women, Peace and Security Index.

The tool provides a rationale for why the command can confidently use those
proxy indicators to assess the women, peace, and security criteria in lieu
of having access to a more preferred metric. The assessment of these proxy
indicators can provide an understanding of cross-sectoral gender dynamics
within an African partner nation and its security forces and institutions,
allowing for tailored approaches to working on women, peace, and security
implementation through security cooperation activities.

*A Step in the Right Direction*

While there is utility in this new tool, like many analytic tools, Fleser
acknowledges that it has its limitations. ?It is important to remember that
proxy indicators are an indirect measurement,? she cautions, ?and they do
not give us the full picture of how our partners are implementing the
women, peace, and security mandate within their security sectors. They
will, however, point us in a direction that is useful to security
cooperation planning.?

The WPS criteria established do not represent an exhaustive list of
criteria necessary for implementation but allows the command to work
together with African partners to identify new criteria for advancing the
WPS mandate through security cooperation activities. ?Now the command has
an initial set of criteria that tells us what WPS looks like within our
doctrinally defined security force assistance categories,? Fleser said.

The SFA assessment tool advances the command?s implementation of the WPS
mandate in several ways. First, it introduces quantitative data to
complement the qualitative data that currently informs the inclusion of WPS
pillars in security cooperation planning. Second, it provides security
cooperation planners with a defined set of WPA criteria that nest within an
annual process they already support, simplifying and clarifying WPS
implementation. Third, the tool supports one of the key principles
underpinning the mandate by including nontraditional security indicators
and using them to inform a uniquely military planning process.

"Although not perfect, the SFA assessment tool is designed to facilitate
better security cooperation planning and WPS implementation," Fleser said.
"It does not provide a binary good/bad assessment of African partner
nations. Rather, it enables the command to better understand how gender
influences the security sector using quantitative data to support that
analysis and opens the opportunities for working together with our partner
nations to advance a mandate critical to achieving our mutual security
objectives."

*NYU TANDON HACKS CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION*

The Tandon School of Engineering, in partnership with New York City Cyber
Command (NYC3), launched the Cyber Fellows
<http://act.online.engineering.nyu.edu/acton/ct/9709/s-5515-1801/Bct/q-6af3/l-sf-lead-000c:108d/ct2_1/1?sid=TV2%3AvmzTofZzs>,
a unique, affordable online cybersecurity master?s degree program designed
in conjunction with elite New York City employers to address the acute
shortage of highly trained technical professionals in the city and nation.

It offers scholarships of as much as *75 percent* of tuition to U.S.
residents, bringing the total tuition for the rigorous, highly technical
education to *$15,000 for the entire program* ? the lowest of any
cybersecurity master?s degree program in New York City.

One of the program?s most compelling benefits: A free five-year
subscription to audit the newest versions of the online courses that
graduates took as Cyber Fellows ? important because coursework typically
updates every semester, as new threats emerge.

*?We want our Cyber Fellows to know we will be with them for the long term
? and I have no doubt that their experiences in the field will enrich
future scholars,? - Professor Nasir Memon.*

*Open to all US residents nationwide. *
