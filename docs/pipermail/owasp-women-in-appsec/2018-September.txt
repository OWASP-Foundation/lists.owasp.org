Hi Josh and all,

I agree with @Josh and support the proposal. So far, the WIA Committee is
the only OWASP Committee set to be run under the Committees 2.0 Operational
Model.

I definitely see the potential opportunity for value and sustainability
from an OWASP Chapters Committee, at the global and local Chapter community
levels.

>From my experience, the ongoing, extra volunteer work (online
communications and monthly global Committee calls, outside of local
meetings / events) has been worthwhile as a means of continuous
collaboration and driving the global OWASP mission. That said, many
discussions I?ve had (regarding WIA and otherwise) confirm my reasons for
agreeing. I also copy the WIA Officers inbox and WIA Committee mailing list
here.

I look forward to conintued discussion / collaboration of the Committee
Adoption, based on my perspective as both an OWASP Committee Chair and a
Brooklyn Chapter member.

Best,
Zoe

Dear Leaders and Community Members,

First of all, thank you for all the comments and for your support of the
Foundation.  We very much value your input on this email thread.


As an open source community we believe that committees will enhance the
engagement and service of the Foundation to the community. A Global Chapter
committee will be helpful to support the chapters and assist them with
their initiatives. Based on this, it is clear, we all want the same thing
for the Foundation. Committees will enhance engagement and community
relationships. Please join one of the three *Town-Hall meetings *to discuss
the Foundation and the path we should take for the future. These meetings
will include ideas for other committees we need to create as well. It is
important that we have the *entire** leader community comment *through the
month of September. We have *over 600 leaders *that should have an
opportunity to share their thoughts and suggestions with the Foundation.
Let's give them this opportunity to respond to the Foundation throughout
the month of September.

The Foundation is very sensitive to recent communications with the
community as well and hosting Town-Hall meetings will allow for collective
input on the committees so that at the AppSec USA leaders meeting we can
address all needed committees with the community. We need to provide the
community *(more than 600 leaders today*) with sufficient time to share
their thoughts on several items concerning the future of the Foundation.
The comments on this email thread are very valuable, but with more than 600
leaders there are many more voices to be heard.

Furthermore, I personally need this time as well to understand the
community better.  There is no need to rush one committee, all committees
will be created in October. Let?s give the greater community time to
respond and speak to the Foundation and the community.


I would also like to ask any community members reading this email to share
their thoughts on the approach of Town-Hall meetings in September and
creation of committees in October.  Please take time to join one of the
Town-Hall meetings, your involvement is vital and we need to hear from you.
I would very much like to hear what you have to say about the Foundation
and its future path.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. If you have any questions or
need additional information on the Foundation or the Town-Hall meetings,
just contact me or Matt T.


Sincerely,

Karen

A progressive step might be to take an inventory of the people who are
still very active in OWASP Foundation from this time period:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Pages review the what
happened/what failed and then determine how the back office can provide and
what support can be offered.

<http://t.sidekickopen24.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs5wLWwxW64Jly85wf4f0W1p7Y5W56dGqdf3kvs0002?t=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2Fu%2F0%2Fgoog_724668790&si=5971359149588480&pi=99b2e07e-d1bc-4d45-e408-baaaf75a588d>
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Pages

Ironically people like Martin (Education), Josh (Chapters) and many others
are still very active in the community, and history is important. Now that
Martin is the Chairman of the organization a great topic of what worked,
what did not...

[not to interfere with the questions of Carlos below]

Dear All, is my observation correct that the committee Josh initiated to
establish is to review the functioning and the management of the Foundation
and the quality of the services provided to the community, and probably the
role of the Board in maybe letting the operational/organizational problems
persist, etc.?

If so then that committee is in the first iteration an audit body and
probably in the second is a crisis management body. One of the subjects of
the review is then the Foundation staff and management. Correct? If so the
management and the Board should not make decisions regarding the
establishment of the committee, beyond the formalities and the control of
the ethical conduct and compliance.

Please correct me if I'm lost!

Ps. The rules say that the committee operates on behalf of the Foundation,
I guess it reads as on behalf of the legal body (the charity and the
represented community).

Timur

Dear  Carlos,
Thank you for your email and your questions.
I think you were on the Town Hall meeting on Friday- so hopefully many of
your questions have been answered.
We have 228 Chapters - and 110 projects each chapter and project has at
least one leader and most have 2 to 3 three leaders, based on this we have
approximately 600 leaders of various chapters and projects around the world.

Regarding the questions below:
*B) Information of current request records tipified by categories*
*B.1) quantity of requests initiated during 2018*
*B.2) quantity of requests closed and with the approval of the initiator*
*B.3) quantity of requests open and pending yet*

I will pull a report for requests made to the foundation for chapters
etc..and share on the PPT for the next Town Hall meeting for this Friday,
September 21, 2018.

Thank you for your patience and interest in OWASP.

Best Regards,
Karen

>>>>>>>>> community has made a number of observations about inadequacies in the ways
>>>>>>>>> our Chapters interact with the OWASP Foundation, it's Staff, and the
>>>>>>>>> Board.  This committee would serve as a new form of governance within the

>>>>>>>>> Values of openness, innovation, being a global community, and integrity.
>>>>>>>>> We will focus on strengthening the OWASP Chapters through education,
>>>>>>>>> networking, and driving value to our members.
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>> Topics that are within scope for the OWASP Global Chapters
>>>>>>>>> Committee include, but are not limited to:
>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>    - *Leadership Requirements: *The committee will be responsible
>>>>>>>>>    for defining requirements for new chapter leaders and create a community
>>>>>>>>>    vetting process.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Activity Requirements: *The committee will be responsible
>>>>>>>>>    for defining the minimum activity requirements for chapters and will
>>>>>>>>>    periodically review chapters for meeting those minimum requirements.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Mentorship: *Programs will be created to pair new chapter
>>>>>>>>>    leaders together with more experienced ones.  Budgets will be established
>>>>>>>>>    in order to facilitate mentees attendance of mentor chapter meetings.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Projects Partnership Tours: *To emphasize the importance of
>>>>>>>>>    projects, a budget will be established for projects to hold regional tours
>>>>>>>>>    of chapters where they will speak and show off their projects.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Budgets: *The committee will be a resource for OWASP
>>>>>>>>>    policies and procedures when it comes to the budget process and ensuring
>>>>>>>>>    that it is being followed.  The committee will help identify opportunities
>>>>>>>>>    for chapter leaders to spend their money.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Policy: *The committee will review and revise the Chapter
>>>>>>>>>    Leader Handbook on a periodic basis.  They will assess gaps in existing
>>>>>>>>>    policies and help to create new policies or redefine existing policies to
>>>>>>>>>    address gaps.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Guidance: *The committee will serve to help guide other
>>>>>>>>>    leaders with any questions that they have.  They will assist with finding
>>>>>>>>>    speakers.  They will help to recommend topics for presentations.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Feedback: *The committee will survey chapter leadership on
>>>>>>>>>    pertinent topics and be a listening outlet for chapter needs.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Conflict Resolution: *The committee will serve as a
>>>>>>>>>    tribunal for conflicts among and between chapters.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Local and Regional Events: *The committee will help to
>>>>>>>>>    guide chapter leaders on how to start and run local and regional events.  A
>>>>>>>>>    "startup" budget will be formed from existing event revenues in order to
>>>>>>>>>    seed investment in more events, helping additional chapters to be able to
>>>>>>>>>    raise enough money to cover their expenses and innovate.
>>>>>>>>>    - *Board Guidance: *The committee will work with the Board on
>>>>>>>>>    any initiatives they have as they relate to chapter policies, governance,
>>>>>>>>>    budgets, or otherwise.

Hi Zoe,

Section 3.01 of the Foundation Bylaws provides the Board of Directors with
broad authority to manage the business and affairs of the Foundation.  The
OWASP Committees 2.0 was created by the Board to empower the members of
OWASP to make decisions and act, it wasn't designed to remove power from
the Board.  It's my belief the Board has acted within their authority.  If
you disagree, I suggest raising the issue on the OWASP Governance List:

https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/governance

Additionally, if you believe Bev Corwin should be reinstated, and/or if you
wish to modify the Committees 2.0 charter to limit the Board's power to
act, then you should request to be added to the agenda of the next Board
meeting and ask them to vote for those changes.


Best regards,

- Bil

Hi all,

I don't have a whole lot more to add to this except to reiterate what Bil
has already said and state that the board didn't over step the mark - they
were simply implementing a recommendation made on the back of a report from
(this) compliance committee. So really your complaint is with our
recommendation?

I think the line you quote below Zoe ("Members of the OWASP Board of
Directors are allowed to become committee members, but participate as
normal committee members with no special powers either expressed or
implied. While Board member participation in committees is encouraged,
Board members must refrain from taking an active leadership role for the
committee.") isn't really intended for this situation - it is just
highlighting whether or not the board can be involved in a committee, not
what they as BoDs can do as part of there roles within the foundation.

With regards Bil, currently he is simply running for a BoD seat and is
still a member of the compliance committee so it is entirely appropriate
for him to respond to your complaint. As Bil mentioned, it was the middle
of the night for me as this discussion was taking place so I am only
getting the chance to respond now.

Katherine, thanks you for clarifying your stance. So far we have only heard
from yourself and Zoe on this issue. If anyone else in WIA would like to
respond to this thread to give their thoughts please do. Or you can respond
just to compliance at owasp.org if you would like to do so in confidence.

Kind regards,
Fiona

Fiona Collins,
OWASP Cork Chapter Lead

Hi All,

Please excuse me jumping in without knowing the history of these events or the nature of the disagreement. 

My only thought is to ask you Zoe and the committee at large if there may be an option to not exclude a person from the group or OWASP. Info Sec is such a small community and women within it that much smaller. Putting myself in the place of the person ?excommunicated?, it would be a great loss. 

This is a formative time for WIA so maybe we can go through the process to have the board reconsider and have an attenuated response such that a passionate person in the community is not cut off. 

Just my thoughts in case it can be reconsidered and if things can be worked out. 

Yours truly,
Alka

And since there isn't any written policy or procedure for handing the complaint, they could outright dismiss it, leaving you with no recourse but to leave the Awesome Committee.  And if you took your complaint to the Compliance Committee, the Awesome Committee would complain that their autonomy is being violated, making them unaccountable to OWASP Foundation.  I don't see how how your ask would fairly serve the members of OWASP when applied globally, not to just this one case.  But again, you could carry this forward and have the Board vote to enact it.

Hi Alka,

Thank you for your input. I really agree that it is a mistake, given there
WIA Committee goals, to exclude one of the few women who has dedicated
years of InfoSec expertise and initiating and continuously supporting WIA.
As Alka mentions, this is a formative time for WIA, and we want to remain
unified in our shared goals and act accordingly.

This is why I made it a point to initiate the discussion on this thread.

Again, encouraging any additional feedback from more WIA Committee members
in response to this thread in our decision-making process as to whether or
not to take the matter to the BoD for reconsideration.

Best,
Zoe

Hi Josh,

Yes, WIA is charted under Committees 2.0.  There are a few things to unpack
here:

1. Bev's membership in WIA or OWASP wasn't revoked, she is barred from
participating in WIA for one year.  The Bylaws specifically allow it
(Section 4.07)
2. Bev is not part of the WIA leadership team, which is the condition for
the rule you cited.
3. Even if the rule applied (it doesn't), and her WIA membership was
revoked (it wasn't), it still doesn't exclude other ways to have membership
removed, it simply provides one way for the committee to do it.

This isn't a case of the Board meddling in the affairs of a committee, this
the Board following the published process for handling a complaint and
using their designated powers to enforce OWASP policies.

And just so I'm clear, are you arguing that the Board is powerless to
suspend participation by a member found to have violated policy, because
the participation happens within a committee charted under 2.0?  I don't
believe that is the case, however if you do, I'd like to understand why,
and more importantly, what is the purpose of having all power transferred
to the committee?


- Bil

The WIA Committee Officers, then larger WIA Committee, will discuss to form

Hi Owen, Bil and Josh,

I?d like to take a moment (as an individual OWASP member, not WIA Committee
Chair to convey the following message (although I include WIA Officers and
WIA Committee members here for reasons of transparency and openness to
their feedback, along with everybody else?s):

@Bil, you claim that I am wrong in mentioning that the OWASP Committees 2.0
Operational Model?s goal of independent Committee decision-making rights
suggests that an OWASP Committee should be consulted before decisions are
made on its behalf.

I believe that @Josh understands the intentions of such a governance model
considering that he was a BoD member at the time the BoD voted on its
initiation. However, on the OWASP 9/21 Town Hall meeting and @Bil?s and
@Owen?s responses questioning Josh?s relevant statements.

I find this to be problematic, given the validity of @Josh?s input on
various recent governance issues currently being discussed theoughout
OWASP. Does anyone else agree with me on this?

Best,
Zoe

Thank you all for you comments.  Here is the position of the Compliance
Committee:

1. Regarding the complaint by Zoe against the Board: The Compliance
Committee does not view the actions take by the Board as violating the
policies of OWASP.  If the Board meant to disempower themselves from
committees chartered under the Committees 2.0 policy, then the 2.0 policy
should be updated to reflect this.  If you are interested in having this
change made, propose it to the Board and have them vote to adopt it.  I
would suggest outside counsel review this change though, because the
members of the Board have personal liability in some circumstances, and if
a 2.0 Committee takes action that exposes OWASP to liability, it could be
the members of the Board are liable, yet have no power to address the
liability.  I personally would not serve on the Board if such a change were
adopted.

2. Regarding the complaint by Bev about the Compliance Committee
investigation and findings: The Compliance Committee welcomes feedback on
how we can improve our investigation model for future engagements.
However, once we hand off the case to the Board, it is closed on our side
unless the Board returns it to us.

3. Regarding the complaint by Bev about the Board: The Compliance Committee
views the actions taken by the Board as within their power and scope.  If
Bev wishes to appeal their decision, she must petition the Board.  Perhaps
a more formal appeal process should be created?  If so, please email the
Governance list with the suggestion.

4. This case, from the Compliance Committee's perspective, is closed - it
was handed off to the Board.  This means if you disagree with the outcome,
the investigation, the process, the rulings, etc, then you must take it up
with the Board.  The Compliance Committee has investigative power and the
ability to issue reports and recommendations to the Board, but we do not
have the power to implement policy changes or reverse decisions, that power
rests solely with the Board.


Best regards,

- Bil

Hello OWASP Leaders and Women in AppSec,

Encouraging you all to start thinking about WIA plans and provide your
input on WIA sponsorships.  AppSec Cali 2018 CFP deadline is October 15,
and it would be great to facilitate more Women in AppSec engagement there.

@Richard, any suggestions / input on what you and the AppSec Cali 2018
planning team have in mind so far?

Best,
Zoe
