Quite a list of requirements to be on the committee.  I don?t know if I qualify for all of them, but I definitely hope to be able to be more active this year in WIA and I am looking forward to AppSec 2017 (wherever it is held!)

Tiffany can provide details, but my understanding is that one of the requirements is to have 5 committee leaders. We only currently have 2 (Emily and myself). I don't believe that staff can be on committees, but it would be nice if they could, IMHO. They certainly are a value add. But we may need to recruit 3 additional committee leaders for WIA to graduate to Committee status. I assume that all committees are under the same requirements.

Hello All,


Since July 2014 OWASP has used Committees as the method for members to
drive global change in targeted areas.  Committees have the ability to make
recommendations to the board with a louder voice and request funds in a way
that general groups of people do not have access to.  Because the move from
initiatives to committees has not been facilitated previously, I propose
that we honor the work done by existing active initiatives by accelerating
the process which requires the leader's list show vocal support with no
strong objections.

This means that the Board will be given notice and a call for members will
be initiated. At this time anyone may join the committee.  This is a great
opportunity to grow your committee attendance.

There are three types of members in a committee:

1) Voting members who are either founding members or invited to become
voting members after having been a participating member for at least 3
months.
2)Participating members who are able to participate in the discussions and
activities of the committee but not vote
3)Staff/Board members who are participating members with the added
restriction of not being able to lead the conversation.

After the process is done, initiatives as they exist now will be totally
phased out.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Hi everyone,

Thanks!

We definitely should organize as an official committee and I didn't see
anyone object to doing that.  To kick off the process, we need the
following two items:

1. We need someone who will send the committee formation email to the OWASP
Leaders List.
2. For that email, we need the "rationale and desired scope" for the WIA
Committee.  We should hash that out here.

The Leaders list then discusses the formation of the committee.  I
recommend everyone here join the Leaders list so that you can contribute to
the discussion.  Assuming there are not major objections, it then goes to
the BoD for a vote.  Once the BoD approves, we then need at least five
OWASP members to join the newly formed committee (if you're not a OWASP
member, please join so you can help us here).

For reference, here is the official process for forming a committee:

At any point in time, a community member may propose a new committee via
the OWASP Leaders List stating their rationale and desired scope for
creating a new committee. After a community discussion, with perceived
majority support and no major arguments against, the OWASP Board of
Directors will establish whether there is a conflict of interest with any
existing committees and whether the formation of that committee is in line
with with OWASP goals. If no conflict is determined to exist, the Board
will initiate a public call for OWASP members interested in committee
membership, via the OWASP Community mailing list, with a seven day time
window. So long as the committee receives at least five OWASP members
applicants, the Board will vote on the committee creation. A majority vote
of support from the Board is sufficient for establishment of a new
committee with all OWASP member applicants being granted committee
membership.

Hi Bil,

This all sounds good, however, we already completed the first two thirds of
this process years ago. I would suggest that WIA's previous status as an
Initiative should give it status in moving forward with only the final
steps to become a committee. I doubt that the leaders list will want to
re-do all of the discussions from the past. It may make sense to renew the
discussion as a committee with the leaders list. Considering that WIA has
been operating with board approval for a long time, has a wiki page and
list already, we should only need to identify the 5 leaders to comply with
the new requirements, and let the community know about the transition. WIA
is *not* a new thing and should not have to start our from scratch, as if
it walked in off the street. At this point, we should simply focus on
compliance with the committee requirements and begin operating
appropriately.

Sincerely,
Bev

PS: Just because we have new staff, and/or a new Committee framework, does
not mean that we have to rebuild everything at OWASP from the beginning
again.

Bev,

I am sorry you feel that my intention is to start everything from the
beginning again.  That must be a miscommunication. As I told you the first
time we spoke about initiatives and committees my plan is to convert them
further along in the process.  Unfortunately, the committee structure is
not new, it predates my hiring by almost 2 years, it was just not
implemented.  Any initiatives who wish to come under the new committee
structure and which are active (active means they can demonstrate that they
are meeting or communicating regularly--regularly is defined by the context
each initiative has set for itself)  will send me their scope and host a
call for members.  If post that call for members the committee has met the
minimum guidelines they will be considered fully converted and expected to
follow the Committees 2.0 guidelines as well as have access to the benefits
of committees.  At that point we will ramp down and redundant structures.

The hope is that by conforming to the official structures of OWASP there
will be less confusion about resources and therefore our community will be
more empowered to continue to develop.    The key here is that we are
looking to improve clarity using already existing tools.

Best,
Tiffany

Thanks for the updates Tiffany, It will be helpful to have a complete
assessment of WIA and any other previously existing initiatives that wish
to convert to the committee framework so that we know what is still needed
for WIA, or any other initiatives to be compliant as a committee. I am
fully aware that the committee structure has been around for a while, and
that you came on after the fact. However, you may also take note that since
the committee framework was implemented at OWASP that *no one* has taken
any interest in it. Therefore, as I was trying to explain to you at
AppSecUSA, OWASP BoD and staff may want to take that into account as
something important about the members and larger community. If something
was implemented that no one wants, what good is it anyway? In addition, you
may also notice that there are a number of still active Initiatives that do
great work, however unappreciated and unrecognized by the BoD and staff.
The fact remains that people were willing to do Initiatives, but not many
are interested in Committees. I would consider this an important message
from your user and member communities - especially for designing any future
"top down" implementations that people apparently are not interested in
doing. Best wishes, Bev

PS: I would just like to clarify that I am also in favor of WIA
transitioning from an Initiative to a Committee, I just do not think that
we need to focus on compliance rather than re-creation. I also think that
the non interest in Committees should be re-examined, and the Initiatives
should still have a place in the OWASP framework for any Initiatives that
are not interested in transitioning to Committees. Thanks!

If we don't have to start from scratch, then that's even better.  When the
call for members comes up, I plan to join.  And I think we have enough
folks here to meet the five member minimum.

I'll be on the call next week.

Great! Thanks Bil, Sound good. So far, I think we have 5 now with Emily,
Tanya, Tina, Bil (you) and Bev (me). Looking forward to meeting with you
all to prepare for the compliance / transitions to Committee status. Thank
you. Best wishes, Bev

I waited the entire time for the call to start and it didn't.  Bev, I
thought you were running the call, all of the invites came from you, and I
thought you set the time.  You have previously said that your work can take
you out of commission on short notice to deal with incidents, would it make
sense to have someone else who's work is more steady lead and schedule the
calls?

I have time next Tuesday, November 15 from 5pm to 10pm Pacific (8pm to 1am
Eastern).  Will an hour meeting within that range work?  If not, I can
setup a Doodle poll to find a common open slot for everyone.

Also, I believe everyone that is interested in attending is based in the
US, but if not, please let us know where you're at so we can find a time
that works for everyone.

For the call itself, we should make sure there are a few people who are
planning to attend that can start the meeting, or we should use a
conference line where it doesn't require a leader to start the call.

Finally, for the agenda, there are a few items I'd like to have discussed:

1. Status of conversion from Initiative to Committee, hopefully Tiffany can
join and let us know how that's going.  I did see the email from Tiffany
to the BoD about it.

2. AppSec USA 2017.  I've started a conversation with Laura Grau regarding
getting space for WIA and would like to discuss the high-level plans.

3. Scope of the new committee.  Here's the current draft:

The purpose of the Women in AppSec (WIA) committee is to increase the
visibility and participation of women in application security. The scope
for WIA falls into the following areas:

1. Attract women to OWASP, both as members and as participants.
2. Offer opportunities for women to become engaged in the AppSec field and
community.
3. Provide targeted programs for women in high school, college, and recent
college graduates.
4. Provide training and mentorship for women.
5. Provide financial support for women through scholoships and grants.
6. Integrate WIA into OWASP events, including global application security
events.
7. Cultivate women speakers for conferences, trainings, and local events.
8. Develop special projects and events designed to further the purpose of
WIA.



Thanks,

- Bil

Hi Tiffany, Lucas, and Bil,

I'm happy to help organize the call, (you are welcome) but anyone can do
that, too. If I'm unable to start the call, Tiffany and Emily have the
information and could have started the call easily. We discussed this
before. In the future, Any staff member or leader should be able to start
the call. You don't need to wait for me to do that. We've talked about this
at previous meetings, since you and Emily have the login info, you can
start it as easily as anyone else, better if it is a team effort. We can
also give the other Committee leaders the log in info, as well.

Lucas, what times work best for you? 1pm is usually a good time for East
Coast, West Coast, EU and other areas. We've been meeting later in the day
/ evening to for Emily's work schedule. We could try a schedule rotation.
One month earlier and one month later.

Anyone is welcome to schedule a meeting. At AppSecUsA we discussed
continuing the same schedule on a monthly rather than weekly basis.
Tiffany, of course, go ahead and schedule one, if you like. You don't need
to wait for me or have my permission. Same is true for any of the Committee
leaders, or staff. At AppSecUSA we discussed and decided to continue with
monthly meetings to continue the momentum. Let's try again next week and
discuss schedule rotation from evening and afternoons for EU participants.
I'll send the login info to Bil, too, so he also is able to start up if
needed. I'll plan to be there, but with my work in managing critical
services, I can be called away at any time, so as we've discussed
previously, just start the meeting, don't wait for me. Thank you and best
wishes.

Sincerely,
Bev

(sending again, my first email was too large for the list, so I trimmed the
thread below)

Let's see if we can meet next week, here's a Doodle poll for Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday.  If anyone is interested in meeting next week (or if
you want to attend, but next week is out), be sure to fill out the poll.
Be sure to adjust the timezone for your location (on the right-hand side),
and the times will automatically change for your location:

PS: We should probably use this document until Emily opens up the other one
for editing to the leaders:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K1T0fbfawOfyri3bZKGu9ayuzZJIzV7dSyGpFfPQxrA/edit?ts=5745bff3
.

This was used previously, and then Emily started a new one, but it wasn't
set to edit for anyone but Emily, so we can't update it. You can add and
update the one above. It is what we used before. Thanks!

Bev

Subject: [Women_in_security] Doodle Poll for meeting next week
Message-ID: <CACtAMnPayAWUQPcwU-q0aCwpf7OfOSKCKFzYjR2rLy1eLYqpmw@mail.gmail.com>

Here's the Doodle Poll for possible meeting times next week that I sent out
earlier:

http://doodle.com/poll/nscufyzifqxp8vyb

If you're interested in attending a meeting next week, please respond (even
if none of the times work).

So far it looks like the early evening (Pacific timezone) works best for
most folks, but it's way too late for Europe.  The suggestion to alternate
with early/late meetings might be the way to address this.  I know for
myself, I can meet earlier in the day if I have enough notice.

The other option is we meet on the weekend when most people are not working
- that isn't ideal for me, but throwing it out there in case it is a better
solution for others.

Thoughts?

- Bil

Based on the Doodle poll, I'll schedule a call on Tuesday, November 15 at
6pm Pacific and will send out an invitation shortly.  There wasn't a
timeslot that worked for everyone, so apologies to Lucas, I know this
timeslot is way to late for Europe.  I'll send out a new Doodle poll for
the next meeting and will only provide times that work for Europe, so that
we can alternate and include everyone.

 Nov 15, 2016 7pm - 8pm (MST) (bil.corry@owasp.org)
Message-ID: <001a11370a38727b3a0541310534@google.com>

You have been invited to the following event.

Title: OWASP WIA November Meeting
OWASP WIA November Meeting
Nov 15, 2016 at 9:00 pm - 10:00 pm EST

Please visit & join the meeting space from your computer, tablet, or  
smartphone.

https://www.gotomeet.me/owasp/owasp-wia-november-meeting



Agenda:


? Status of conversion from Initiative to Committee, hopefully Tiffany can  
join and let us know how that's going. I did see the email from Tiffany to  
the BoD about it.

? AppSec USA 2017. I've started a conversation with Laura Grau regarding  
getting space for WIA and would like to discuss the high-level plans.

? Scope of the new committee. Here's the current draft:

The purpose of the Women in AppSec (WIA) committee is to increase the  
visibility and participation of women in application security. The scope  
for WIA falls into the following areas:

  1. Attract women to OWASP, both as members and as participants.
  2. Offer opportunities for women to become engaged in the AppSec field and  
community.
  3. Provide targeted programs for women in high school, college, and recent  
college graduates.
  4. Provide training and mentorship for women.
  5. Provide financial support for women through scholoships and grants.
  6. Integrate WIA into OWASP events, including global application security  
events.
  7. Cultivate women speakers for conferences, trainings, and local events.
  8. Develop special projects and events designed to further the purpose of  
WIA.

I found it here, but I don't know how to edit it:

https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=aGw2Y2pnczZlcDFoN29uaXFndWV1MmJoYm9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ&pli=1

Is there a wiki page that describes how to add events to it?

Log in to your OWASP email account, open your OWASP calendar, and it should
be listed under calendars. Click on it, and then you can add it. You can
also click on "More Actions" drop down menu after you save the meeting to
copy it to the OWASP Calendar.

Subject: [Women_in_security] Doodle Poll for December Meeting
Message-ID: <CACtAMnNBCDNExXihjr3SsfXUUQg4NdGzbh_xbCtPyatDw=NyMg@mail.gmail.com>

I've setup a Doodle Poll for the December meeting.  The times are more
friendly to Europeans (or so I hope) and I've added a Saturday option to
explore if that might also work.

Be sure to adjust the timezone to your own!

http://doodle.com/poll/mryrsrq2rnsv3tae

I'm going to use the poll on Sunday, November 20 to schedule the meeting,
please fill out the poll before then.

Thanks!

- Bil

It's not listed on my calendar.  I would need either need the iCal URL in
order to add it, or if it's under a "co-worker" account, I would need the
name to add it.

Yes, the Doodle poll showed that 7pm Arizona time (my timezone) had the
most availability for everyone, which is 6pm Pacific and 9pm Eastern.

Try opening the calendar invitation on your OWASP calendar - you need to
log on to your OWASP account . After you open the calendar invitation, use
the "More Actions" drop down to copy it to the OWASP Calendar.

Thanks for adding it.

BTW  "More Actions" doesn't provide me with a way to copy to the OWASP
calendar, probably because it hasn't been added as an extra calendar.
Without the iCal link (and possibly permission as editor), I can't add
anything to the OWASP Events calendar.

PS: Oh, and Emily, we should try to move these discussions to the WIA list:
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appsec_usa_women_in_security
(especially if we want to be a "compliant" committee someday! LOL!)

Hi Bil, That makes sense. Yes, I've had editing rights for a long time
since I often help make updates, wiki editor and all. But I thought that
the calendar was available to add to all members' owasp accounts, so you
might want to try adding it.  I just tried sharing it with you. Let me know
if it works. Best wishes, Bev

Thanks, that added it to my Calendar so I can view it, but I don't have
editing permission for it.

During the last WIA call, it was suggested that I put the draft of the WIA
Purpose and Scope online for commenting.  You can see it here (you'll need
to use your OWASP account):

https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1-cDEmeiYpaRbqWpgHW3LIGTT_4zqtfpUn1wS-lSSOZE/edit?usp=sharing

This scope will be used to form the WIA Committee, so it's important that
it correctly reflect the scope of WIA.  I look forward to reading your
comments.

Thanks,

- Bil

Dear All,

Last week when I was to submit your committee I became quite ill and had to
take the rest of the week off.  This week I was in the staff summit each
day.  I would like to submit you for a committee asap, preferably today.  I
noticed that you edited the scope doc, so I will wait until you all tell me
that it is in its agreed final form.

I, too, did some editing, but only for readability.  However, there are two
points that I made comments on about content.  Clearly however the team
decides to go will be totally supported, I just wanted to make sure that
the conversation has been had.

I have individually noted the co leads and bil, who has written most of the
doc, because I want to make sure that those most active in the doc see this
email asap.

Best,
Tiffany

Likewise, glad you're back Tiffany!

I've captured the two points into the agenda for the next meeting, we can
discuss them.

Also, I've made the document editable instead of me having to accept
changes.

It's a bit wonky now, since I accepted every change, please read through to
make sure any changes you made are still how you want them.

Thanks,


- Bil

My apologies ladies, I have had a few things come up and I no longer believe I will have the time to serve on the committee.  I wish you all the best of luck ? and if there is anything I can do let me know.

Likewise, glad you're back Tiffany!

I've captured the two points into the agenda for the next meeting, we can discuss them.

Also, I've made the document editable instead of me having to accept changes.

It's a bit wonky now, since I accepted every change, please read through to make sure any changes you made are still how you want them.

Thanks,


- Bil

Dear All,

Last week when I was to submit your committee I became quite ill and had to take the rest of the week off.  This week I was in the staff summit each day.  I would like to submit you for a committee asap, preferably today.  I noticed that you edited the scope doc, so I will wait until you all tell me that it is in its agreed final form.

I, too, did some editing, but only for readability.  However, there are two points that I made comments on about content.  Clearly however the team decides to go will be totally supported, I just wanted to make sure that the conversation has been had.

I have individually noted the co leads and bil, who has written most of the doc, because I want to make sure that those most active in the doc see this email asap.

Best,
Tiffany

During the last WIA call, it was suggested that I put the draft of the WIA Purpose and Scope online for commenting.  You can see it here (you'll need to use your OWASP account):

https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1-cDEmeiYpaRbqWpgHW3LIGTT_4zqtfpUn1wS-lSSOZE/edit?usp=sharing

This scope will be used to form the WIA Committee, so it's important that it correctly reflect the scope of WIA.  I look forward to reading your comments.

Thanks,

4. Scope discussion: working with high schoolers.

5. Scope discussion: should we hardwire the below sentence into our scope,  
or just say that we'll work with other committees and inititatives?

	"Collaborate with OWASP Education Committee, Mentor Initiative (soon to be  
Committee) and Learning Gateway Project providing liaisons to attend  
regular meetings, and provide access for WIA members to participate and  
contribute to Learning Gateway Project user research and requirements

Title: OWASP WIA December Meeting

OWASP WIA December Meeting
Dec 05, 2016 at 5:00 pm - 6:00 pm EST

Agenda:

1. Status of conversion from Initiative to Committee.

2. AppSec USA 2017.  I've started a conversation with Laura Grau regarding  
getting space for WIA and would like to discuss the high-level plans.

3. Scope of the new committee.  Draft is here:  
https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1-cDEmeiYpaRbqWpgHW3LIGTT_4zqtfpUn1wS-lSSOZE/edit?usp=sharing

4. Scope discussion: working with high schoolers.

5. Scope discussion: should we hardwire the below sentence into our scope,  
or just say that we'll work with other committees and inititatives?

	"Collaborate with OWASP Education Committee, Mentor Initiative (soon to be  
Committee) and Learning Gateway Project providing liaisons to attend  
regular meetings, and provide access for WIA members to participate and  
contribute to Learning Gateway Project user research and requirements  
development activities."

My bad, my timezone is Arizona, but the GoToMeeting account is set to
Eastern, and when creating the meeting invite, I used my default timezone
with the time it should have been in Eastern.

Anyhow, the updated invite is the correct one.  Should be 5pm Eastern / 2pm
Pacific on December 5.

Thanks,


- Bil
