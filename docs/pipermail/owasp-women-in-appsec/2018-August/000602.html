<PRE>To whom it may concern,

As you might have been aware of, the compliance committee has investigated
a complaint filed by against Bev Corwin. The compliant committee has
investigated the compliant case and has forwarded an report with
recommendations to the OWASP Foundation Board of Directors.

During the executive meeting of the OWASP Foundation board of directors at
the OWASP AppSec-Eu conference July 4th 2018, this case was discussed based
on recommendations made in the report by the compliance committee. By
unanimous vote of the attending 6 out of 7 members of the OWASP Foundation
board of directors, it was decided that:


   1.

   Bev Corwin, is barred from participation in WIA in any way for the
   period of one year, starting August 1st 2018.
   1.

      Bev Corwin  may continue to serve in your chapter leadership role,
      and also within the other committees and projects she is involved.
      2.

   The period of one year is to be understood as probation time, starting
   August 1st 2018.
   1.

      In the case that there continues to be issues, without any commitment
      on Bev Corwin&#8217;s  part to resolve them, as well as demonstrable progress,
      then she will be asked to step down from leading or participating in all
      OWASP activities.


Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions on the above.

Regards,

Martin Knobloch

OWASP Foundation Chairman of the Board of Directors
