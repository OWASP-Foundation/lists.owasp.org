Wendy,

>From my perspective, you are perpetrating the concept of women as victims
with this research.  The better research would be
"Are women better at social engineering?"  It has been my professional
experience, reinforced by Kevin Mitnick, a famous hacker and colleagues
that work in the penetration testing world that women make better social
engineers.

Also, your survey should ask the sex of the respondent. Not all people in
associations supporting women are women.

Best of luck.

Cindy

Hi Wendy, Good luck with your research. I prefer avoiding "victim"
paradigms, personally, and understand that there are many who practice
otherwise. I doubt that my personal beliefs will put a damper any such
efforts, regardless, and wish you the best with them. Sincerely, Bev

Out of curiosity, is it the vernacular used or the focus of the research
that is the problem?

If it's the vernacular, would changing it to "women survivors of social
engineering" (or similar) make it more palatable?

If it's the focus, is any research that examines when women are targets of
attacks off-limits?

I'm trying to reconcile the objective of this research against the
complaint that it plays into the "women as victims" narrative.  I'm not
seeing that connection, and am now interested to understand why others do.

I prefer "casualty" to "victim". Victim implies societal structures are
architectually sound, which is not the case. "casualty if war" is more
honest.

Typo alert, meant to type "in" not "if". LOL. But I actually like "if" too,
as an observer, might be more appropriate.

Interesting, many retiring & retired women tech industry veterans that I
know with 20+ years, often consider themselves war casualties, and
globalization refugees with many visible and invisible wounds with their
own forms of PTS . But most prefer "wounded warrior" to "victim" paradigms
since a bit less degrading, being a "survivor", and more truthfully
recognizes the reality of their experiences working in hostile environments.
