Subject: [Owasp-poland] Hello OWASP Poland Members
Message-ID: <2158eb58b5ceb4844628f5bd10475ac0@proidea.org.pl>

Hi Folks,
I want to thank everyone who registered with the mailing list.
If you know of anyone else who may be interested please encourage them
to sign up.

We have a local chapter page on owasp.org.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Poland

We need to communicate and decide when we want to have an initial
meeting. I wanted to get this notice out as soon as possible so you 
could put it on
your calendar. The first meeting will have some time talking about what 
we
want to do and how you can help.

Meeting topics will be posted soon.

Thanks
