Subject: [Owasp-poland] Web App Security in Poland
Message-ID: <200712011317.38663.luca.carettoni@ikkisoft.com>

Hi,
    This is my first message in the OWASP-PL mailing so I'll briefly introduce 
myself.
I'm Luca and I work as security researcher in Milan (Italy); I'm also an 
active member of the OWASP-IT chapter as well as a real enthusiast on webapp 
security.
I'm thinking to move myself in Poland (Warsaw) so I'm searching information 
about specialized jobs in this field.

How do you evaluate the situation in the polish market?

Do you know some sort of database about network/application security firms 
(penetration test, vuln research, ecc.)? 

Cheers,
Luca  

ps: See you soon in the next OWASP events, maybe in Poland...
