you *become a paid OWASP member or renew your membership between July 1 and
July 8, 2012*:

   - 40% of your Membership dues will be put towards the Project Reboot
   Initiative
   - You will be entered into a raffle for one of 6 great global event
   passes:  2 BlackHat USA 2012 passes (valued at $2000 each) and 4 passes to
   the OWASP Global AppSec Event of your choice (valued at $500 each) are up
   for grabs!
   - Secure your voice in the upcoming election of 3 Global Board of
   Directors Positions!

To participate, all you need to do is purchase a membership between July 1
