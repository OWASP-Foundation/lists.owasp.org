 Hi all,


*if you are in Europe this June, come to Cambridge to join us at AppSecEU.
And if you're not in Europe, here is the perfect reason to fly over now:
join AppSec EU in Cambrid**ge! ;-)  *

AppSecEU 2014 is approaching quickly and we have lots of great speakers and
exciting presentations and trainings for you.
Your opportunity to discuss with the best in our field, hear the latest
security tech presentations and learn and have a lot of fun.

This year AppSecEU will be in Cambridge, just a short 1-hour train ride
from London.
We got a great venue at Anglia Ruskin University&#8217;s Cambridge campus and
will on June-25 have a stylish conference dinner in the Victorian Gothic
style Great Hall at Homerton College. An evening event not to miss. :-)

*AppSecEU** 2014*
*Date: June 23-26*



*Venue: Cambridge, Anglia Ruskin University Program: Conference
(June-25/26)*
The main conference will be on June 25th and 26th with lots of amazing
keynote speakers flying in, and tech talks about the latest on mobile
security, hacking web applications and how to defend them, to management
topics like lots of best practices and stuff that works. And while there,
you'll have the opportunity to meet and discuss with your peers and
industry experts and also visit tables from our sponsors in the hallway,
who will show their latest tools and products at the exhibition hall.
*T**r**ainings (June-23/24)*
Before that on June-23th and 24th we have 1- and 2-day training classes and
bootcamps where you can dive deep into the technical problems and learn
from the leading experts in the field (and see how deep the rabbit hole
goes). The classes will be about mobile app security, injection flaws,
WebHacking, defensive programming and writing secure code, up to management
trainings about openSAMM and a CISO training about managing application
security for senior managers.

Here the link to the conference page:

And for your registration:

(For your convenience, we also secured a block of very affordable rooms
close to the venue - but better book quickly as they go fast.)


*Please spread the word among your colleagues and friends and looking
forward to seeing you all end of June in Cambridge!*

Cheers, Tobias
