While the project is open to all, the project leader is particularly
looking for developers who will actively contribute code. Mark is
especially interested in any developers that have experience in
customizing Jenkins, extending Git, unit testing frameworks or
customizing management tools like ScrumDo. He is also interested in
any developers focused in extending behaviour driven development
testing frameworks like JBehave.
You can add yourself to the mailing list
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/admin/owasp-std?.?As always, your
suggestions and contributions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
-?Paulo
Paulo Coimbra
OWASP Project Manager
