*This year OWASP has been selected as an official Google Summer of Code
("GSoC") mentoring organization!*

Open source software is changing the world and creating the future.  Want
to help shaping it?  We're looking for students to join us in making 2014
the best Summer of Code yet!

All students currently enrolled in an accredited institution are welcome to
participate in the Google Summer of Code 2014 program along with the OWASP
Foundation.

*What is GSoC?*

The Google Summer of Code program ("GSoC") is designed to encourage student
participation in open source developent.  Throught GSoC, accepted student
applicants will be paired with OWASP mentors from participating
organizations.

*Benefits to students include:*

   - Gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios,
   - An opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic
   pursuits, and
   - Google will be offering successful student contributors a $5,000 USD
   stipend, enabling them to focus on their coding projects for three months.

This program is done completely online.  Students and mentors from more
than 100 countries have participated in past years.

GSoC + OWASP:  Call for Student Proposals

Are you a student and want to code for an OWASP project?

*Here are the steps and some tips on getting started:*

1.  Think of a good idea.  CLICK
HERE<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/d5fe3dca41/ffcb799a6d/223581de08>for
reference.
2.  Do some research yourself based on the idea.
3.  Write up a proposal draft.
4.  Post it to the OWASP GSoC
group<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/d5fe3dca41/ffcb799a6d/7288c99ab4>for
initial discussions with OWASP mentors.
5.  Based on feedback, write up a full proposal - SEE
TEMPLATE<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/d5fe3dca41/ffcb799a6d/a17c726b48>
6.  Submit your proposal to Google Melange from March 10th-March 21st, 2014

Students wishing to participate in GSoC must realize this is a formal
commitment to produce code for the selected OWASP Project during three
months.  You will also take some resources from OWASP project leaders, who
will dedicate a portion of their time to mentor you.  Therefore, we'd like
to have candidates who are committed to helping the OWASP mission.  You
don't have to be a proven developer - in fact, this whole program is meant
to facilitate joining OWASP and other Open Source communities.  However,
experience in coding and applications are welcome.

CLICK HERE<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/d5fe3dca41/ffcb799a6d/eddc4d3008>for
full details and requirements for participating.

We wish you the best of luck,
OWASP GSoC team
