Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Ecommerce Website Edition v1.04 and v1.05
Message-ID: <CAAxdBB=619ocjhB0mysM_cik0fqy=j=NLo+nyrpS5_9gsc5mxw@mail.gmail.com>

I have uploaded v1.04 and v1.05:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-cornucopia-ecommerce_website.pdf

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Cornucopia-deck-ecommercewebsite-XML.zip



v1.04 has one text correction on the face of a single card. v1.05
includes updates based on feedback and comments via this list, at
presentations and by email:

* Updates to alternative game rules
* Additional FAQs created
* Contributors updated
* Supporting media links added


The project wiki pages have been updated too, including some new
details about printing the cards:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia#tab=Cards


Also, Cornucopia was mentioned on the Leaders' list leading to a
somewhat long discussion. Starts at:

  http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2014-March/011054.html

There seems to be some interest in creating a mobile app version, and
doing translations. That discussion led to being interviewed for the
OWASP 24/7 Podcast on Friday:

Last Friday we played our first game.  It was good.  We only ran 5 rounds
but I like how the game steers you towards higher priority items and items
that are more likely a problem.  It educated everyone and helped expose a
couple things we weren't aware of.

We were confused about some of the numbers on the references.  OWASP SCP
references have a long number at the end that we couldn't figure out:  The
smaller numbers seem to reference chapters but the numbers in the hundreds
we didn't figure out.

For example:
OWASP SCP

8, 10, 183
