Thank you, this is very helpful feedback. Comments inline:

Interesting to discuss the cards after the game, but I like how it
keeps the game moving. I'll add that as a suggested alternative play
method to v1.02.

Slightly yes, but the ranking would be organisation/application
specific, so this isn't a rule. I will add this as a FAQ.

I will add this to "alternative game rules".

So far only "trumps" and your "21" as far as I know. Hopefully we will
get some more feedback with time. Originally when I started thinking
about this, I wondered if some version of "trumps" might work, but I
cannot think how exactly. "Whist" might be possible too, where players
have partners - pairing up developrs and testers might be interesting.

Probably not. The length of game needs to match how long attention can
be maintained, and splitting the game into several smaller games, over
a week or so, can work well too.

I think including an application security person to begin with can
help facilitate the process, and avoid too much looking at referenced
items during the game.

Yes, ultimately it is better if the teams become familiar with the
cards/process, so they use them as prompts in future by themselves.

Useful to know.

Great.

Yes, people have different methods of working/learning.

Mmm, yes. I suppose just being seen to be "playing" could be a problem
in some environments too.

I will add a note about allowing sufficient time to print.

I will try to darken some suits, but I realise we are at the mercy of
inkjets and it isn't going to be good as professional printing on
proper coated card. Maybe once we are all more happy with the idea, we
can try to get some printed up properly - OWASP has put a bid in for
some .EU funding, and I submitted a proposal for designing/printing
these decks. If we get it, I'll send decks to everyone who contributes
to the project - and feedback is contributing. Ken, can I list you as
a "contributor" now?

As above! I wanted to keep the cross-referencing on the cards, even if
it is only used at a later time to flesh out the requirements. But I
did struggle to fit it all on, and hence the small size.

Yes, but sort of fun too.
