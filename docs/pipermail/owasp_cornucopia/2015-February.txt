Dear Project Leaders

Your projects have shown a steady and wonderful development, therefore
these projects have been updated to LAB status

   - OWASP CISO Survey <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_CISO_Survey>
   - OWASP Application Security Guide For CISOs
   <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Application_Security_Guide_For_CISOs_Project>
   - OWASP Cornucopia <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia>
   - OWASP Cheat Sheets Project
   <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cheat_Sheets> [image: Thumbsup.png]
   <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Thumbsup.png>


Please keep on updating your wiki page with any new developments of your
projects such as news, new versions, roadmap plans etc. This is essential
to show that the project is still in progress. We could indeed, based on
the developments end of this year, update these projects to Flagship
status, after a major review in october.

Any questions please let me know


Regards

Johanna
