Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Printed card deck availability
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBmN6R9nvOaUFneYooK3-zFJUqaAPU0d49AvRM6YPq57hQ@mail.gmail.com>

As mentioned before, card decks can be purchased as OWASP merchandising:

   http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp_cornucopia/2015-March/000040.html

But currently this can only be used by chapters with suitable funds.

I understand that OWASP is working on converting this into a full
ecommerce store so that anyone can buy any merchandise, including
Cornucopia decks, using a payment card. That is only about a month
away and when I hear more, I will let you know.

Cornucopia is participating in the project summit at AppSec EU in
Amsterdame in May:

If you can help with creating a "how to play" video on the morning of
Wednesday 20th May, please let me know. We need:

- Players
- Someone with a video camera (more than a phone)
- Video editing software/skills
- Sound track recording/editing

As a summit participant, we are also permitted to add a flyer to the
conference attendee's bags. My current draft is at:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Game-flyers.pdf

This is two-side (the back has Snakes and Ladders information). Please
let me have any feedback.

Thanks
