Good news

Following Tom Brennan's efforts to create an OWASP branded box and
instruction leaflet, and their distribution at AppSec USA last year, Tom,
Kate Hartmann and Paul Ritchie have added them to the OWASP merchandise
store:

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Merchandise#Cornucopia_Cards

These are available for chapter leaders to order from their funds, for use
in chapter meetings and local events.
