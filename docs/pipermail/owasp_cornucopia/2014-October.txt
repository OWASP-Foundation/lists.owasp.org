Message-ID: <BLU178-W253C4FBA6333D6170B356B83A10@phx.gbl>

Hello Colin and Cornucopia List Members!

My name is Leonardo Rosso. I'm from Argentina and came across Cornucopia while reading about techniques to help developers threat modeling apps. I've started using MS EoP but wanted to try Cornucopia as well.
 
Long story short, I'd like to, if no one has already committed to doing it, try and translate the deck into Spanish.
 
Please let me know whether I should start or not, and if there's any guideline I should follow.
 
Best Regards
 
Leonardo Federico Rosso

Thank you for your interest. There are two approaches:

- translate just the cards
- translate the whole master Word document, which also includes the cards
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:OWASP-Cornucopia-Ecommerce_Website.docx

We have one volunteer working on the German translation. And yes,
someone else has offered to assist with Spanish, so I will forward
this message on to them directly. Hopefully they can contact you.

I could add the text to Crowdin if that would help.

Colin

Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Quark Express user?
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBk+rTKASX_8_gP_-JyWqSpPsvQLAsdFb1ByvZxYZ=DmhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list members

The master Cornucopia project file is a Word document, but we also
have the cards as a Quark file.  I don't have Quark but do have Adobe
products.  So I am thinking to convert those to Illustrator (or
InDesign) so I can edit the design files when we have Cornucopia
updates or translations.

Can anyone know if this is possible or can help?

Colin
