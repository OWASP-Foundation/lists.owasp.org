Guys

We are thinking on ways to gamify Cornucopia and came up with the idea of doing a Jeopardy game with the cards during Appsec EU.

If we go ahead, would you be interested in taking part? We are hoping to use hangouts on Air so anyone from anywhere could participate.

Thoughts?

Whatever time suits you is fine by me.

I will be in Amsterdam the entire week.

Thanks,

This looks great. Do you think the word "most common vulnerabilities"
in the sub-title should be "greatest risks", like in the OTT now?

You can't include every project. Of course it might be nice to mention
Cornucopia in a sentence with the SCPQRG, as the attacks on the cards
come directly from that. So maybe in #4 after the ASVS sentence....

   "The OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide provides a
short form list of many
    web security requirements; this is also available in the form of a
card game called OWASP Cornucopia."

In #5, could you capitalise the S in "Appsensor", and change "for your
site" to "within your application"

   "AppSensor: Intrusion detection within your application."

Thanks!

Colin
