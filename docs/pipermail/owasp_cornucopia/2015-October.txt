Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Card Sleeves

I've been using the cards for a while. I found that putting them in card
sleeves will protect them for long term use and also make them a little
more smooth. Just posting this to the list if this is useful to anyone else.

The sleeves can be found at most gaming stores but here is a link showing
you the ones that I use:

This will protect your deck and make them much easier to work with. I find
the current Cornucopia card decks have no gloss so they don't slide very
easy. The sleeves make the deck thicker so I use a card deck box for them.

That's very helpful thanks.

I didn't have any input or control to the printing process, but maybe we
can try to define a better card stock for a future batch.
