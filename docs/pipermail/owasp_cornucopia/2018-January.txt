Hi all,

Thanks for your answers. We will start with the .docx file, and more particularly with the card text. We could maybe send a first version to Sebastien.
Happy new year,

Thomas.

As Sebastien says, there have been no attempts to translate this into French. In my reply to Wagner about Portuguese I said:

It will be a large effort. If you want to start this or gather together some other people to help, the best document to begin with is:

   v1.20 EN
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:OWASP-Cornucopia-Ecommerce_Website.docx

After that if you still have energy, there is also the box and leaflet for the printed decks.

Once all of the above are done, we can copy the text into the AI files for the card deck.

Regards

Colin

Hi all,

I work for a French bank company. We have just experimented Cornucopia this morning. Thanks for this great game.

Is it planned to translate Cornucopia - Ecommerce Website Edition into French ? if not, we propose to do so.

Happy end of year celebration,

Thomas Berson.

Great, my replies aren't getting to the mailing list, but that is being investigated by OWASP. 

Kind regards

The good news is that we think mailman has been updated to allow things
that have been held to go through.  The awkward news is that this is indeed
one of those emails.

We are working on a more permanent fix.

Best,

Hello Wagner

Thank you for your interest in OWASP Cornucopia. As far as I am aware
no-one else has started work on creating a version in  Portuguese.

It will be a large effort. If you want to start this or gather together
some other people to help, the best document to begin with is:

   v1.20 EN
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:OWASP-Cornucopia-
Ecommerce_Website.docx

After that if you still have energy, there is also the box and leaflet for
the printed decks.

Regards

Colin
