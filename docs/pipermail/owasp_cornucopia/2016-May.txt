Cornucopia list members (and BCC'd to ASVS project leaders)

We would like to update the mapping on the Cornucopia cards from ASVS
v2 2014 (on v1.10) to ASVS v3. We propose this will become v1.20 of
Cornucopia.

We wondered if anyone had time to help with identifying changes and
additions, or agreeing what the mappings should be, or proof reading
the changes? We can them update the Word document, the XML file, the
Wiki Deck, and finally the print-ready design files.

The current printed decks available from the OWASP Merchandise Store
are v1.04 - apart from a few minor wording changes, the primary
difference between 1.04 and 1.10 is the version of ASVS in the
mappings. The latest printed decks available from OWASP are apparently
on better quality card, and can be obtained in bulk (300 in stock now,
but going quickly). Individual packs of v1.10 are also available from
Blackfoot free of charge, but they do not have the OWASP branded box.

We expect printed decks of v1.20 in both English and Spanish to be
available from the OWASP Merchandise Store later in 2016.

We would also like to update the CAPEC mapping on the Cornucopia cards
from CAPEC v1.7.1 to v2.8:

   https://capec.mitre.org

We propose to include this in the v1.20 of Cornucopia.

Like for ASVSv3, we wondered if anyone had time to help with
identifying changes and additions, or agreeing what the mappings
should be, or proof reading the changes? We can them update the Word
document, the XML file, the Wiki Deck, and finally the print-ready
design files.
