Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Ecommerce Website Edition v1.02
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnk3EVbTtf=Qs=9gZZNTUq8at7ST0Y+oJs_Wihoh0SbHA@mail.gmail.com>

I have uploaded an updated version of OWASP Cornucopia - Ecommerce
Website Edition (v1.02) with some minor changes and additions,
primarily based on the recent feedback provided via this mailing list:

* Warning about time to print added.
* Additional alternative game rules added (twenty-one, play a deck
over a week, play full hand and then discuss).
* Compliance deck concept added.
* FAQs 5 and 6 added.
* Attack descriptions on cards with tinted backgrounds changed to
black (from dark grey).
* Project contributors added.

It can be downloaded here:

If you are coming to AppSec EU next week in Hamburg, please look out
for me. I will be running some popup Cornucopia games during breaks in
the schedule.
