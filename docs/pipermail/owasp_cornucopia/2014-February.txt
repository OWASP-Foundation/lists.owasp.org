OWASP London has arranged for a social meetup where we will play
Cornucopia.  Please see the email from Tobias to the London chapter list
copied in below.

---

*We are on for a game of OWASP Cornucopia in London!*
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia

We organised a table to play Cornucopia on March 3rd 19:00 at the The
Slaughtered Lamb pub (what a name ;-) ).

Pop Up Cornucopia in Clerkenwell
*Date & Time: Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs*
Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street, London EC1V 0DX
(Nearest underground station: Farringdon)

Just show up at 7pm. If you can, RSVP via email to me (
tobias.gondrom at owasp.org) would be nice, so we have a rough idea how many
people are coming. Imagine if the whole OWASP London chapter would descend
on a pub unannounced.... - the pub might get "slaughtered"...

Evening is of course free, but you will have to buy your own beer. And we
have as special guest Colin, the designer of this OWASP game joining us.
:-)

Timeline:
*Start: 19:00*
after everyone got their drinks etc. we start with a 10 minute intro into
the rules of the game and then we just have fun with Cornucopia security
card game

*Winner:* the winner gets a free card deck of Cornucopia and an OWASP bag
(if we have more than one winner, we let the coin decide)! And of course
everybody gains *a lot of fun and security knowledge, enjoying a beer with
OWASP folks. ;-)*

Looking forward to seeing you next Monday.

Cheers, Tobias
