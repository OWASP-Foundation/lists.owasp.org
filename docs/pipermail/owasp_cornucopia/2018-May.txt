Cornucopia list members

We have been trying to find out how everyone can purchase packs of
Cornucopia cards. The link to do this was removed from our project wiki
page by OWASP in early 2017. See the correspondence below for an enquiry
made about this on 18 April 2018.

Bump

We are still after confirmation of how people without OWASP email addresses
can purchase these.

OWASP have confirmed that there is no longer an online form to buy
Cornucopia decks unless you are a chapter leader.

So for everyone else, the process is now to email dawn.aitken at owasp.org
directly and ask to make a purchase request.

Regards  Colin
