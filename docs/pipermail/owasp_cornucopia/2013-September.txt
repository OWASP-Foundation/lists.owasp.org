Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Ecommerce Website Edition v1.03
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnEr9OL1q65mpfttoEXdc_x_Pyrp_fFzsQxnXqEG3MU=g@mail.gmail.com>

I have uploaded an updated version of OWASP Cornucopia - Ecommerce
Website Edition (v1.03) with some further minor changes and additions:

* Cross-references with SCP v2 and ASVS 2009 fully reviewed and updated
* Code letters added for suits in description (for ease of cross-referencing)
* Minor text changes to two attacks
* Attack text and card background colours updated to provide greater contrast

It can be downloaded here:

I have also been seeking help to get the decks created in a
print-ready format. There is a discussion about licensing on the
project leaders' list starting here:
