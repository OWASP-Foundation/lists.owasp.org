Hi Dario/Colin,

Thanks for the wonderful project.

I am a bit confused between the two.

Which one should be preferred?

Also I observed, the project has not gone any updates since a year.

It active or gone dormant ?

Thanks
Amit

Hello Amit

Thanks for your interest in OWASP Cornucopia.

As you noted it is based on Microsoft's Elevation of Privilege (EoP) card
game, but while that was developed for threat modelling of Microsoft's
products like SQL Server, Cornucopia is solely focused on web application
threat modelling. So if you are working with web applications, try
Cornucopia first. But you may gain some alternative insights into your
projects following the STRIDE approach of EoP too. Play both!

Regarding the project, the content has gone through a number of iterations,
so the focus more recently has been on promoting it and getting it
translated into other languages. Those are not small tasks in themselves
and we look forward to further updates in due course. The recent work to
complete a French translation has been marvellous, and there is work in
progress for Portuguese and Spanish.

Regards

Colin

I have added a link to your repository onto the wiki and the v1.21 EN
document. This also references the FR document.

Your name has been added as a contributor. Thank you.

Thomas

Thank you for the additional information, that makes sense.

I have created v1.21-EN (with changes tracked) which alters the version
number (one property), the year in two places, a little extra text on the
title page, links to all the language versions, the change notes on the
last page, and fixes the broken hyperlinks you found. See v1.21t at

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:OWASP-Cornucopia-Ecommerce_Website.docx

Please can you update your 1.20-FR to create 1.21-FR. Unless you spot any
other issues, I will accept all the changes in 1.21t-EN to create 1.21-EN.

I will have a think next about the XML.

Thanks for the reply.

Playing both would be a big ask from the projects who are always shying
away from security

Also how does it compare against OWASP ASVS.

I guess both serve the same purpose.

Cornucopia is mapped to ASVS. Not every item in Cornucopia exists in ASVS.

Thanks Colin.

I?m so happy for to contribue in this project.

In next tuesday, I and Emerson Castilho will talk in The Developer
Conference about Cornucopia (see more in
http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2018/saopaulo/trilha-seguranca
).

Basicaly we will talk about rule games and how we learn about security with
cornucopia

We talked about this theme in DB1 Global Software (where we work). That
video is avaliable in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6zMNrMTaOM

See ya

Cornucopia continues to be improved, updated and promoted. The greatest
effort recently has been in transalating the game into other languages by
many generous volunteers who we need to thank again. Only last week you'll
see some information from Wagner and Emerson about a talk they presented at
a conference recently.

Regarding usage, I would say Cornucopia is only relevant to web
applications, and as the full name suggests it is has particular emphasis
on ecommerce applications. So those are not sector specific, but perhaps
they tend to be business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C)
web applications than B2B. There is feedback from other people on this
mailing list, and that together with feedback at presentations and games
sessions has been used to update the instructions, rules, notes,
alternative play/rules and a few of the cards themselves. If you search
Twitter you will also find some third-party comments.
