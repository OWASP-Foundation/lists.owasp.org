<PRE>Cornucopia contributors and users

At the start of May I submitted an entry to the .UK registrar
Nominet's Internet Awards 2014:

   <A HREF="http://nia.nominet.org.uk/">http://nia.nominet.org.uk/</A>

The entry is here:

Today I received an email to say Cornucopia has been shortlisted in
the &quot;Making the internet a safer place&quot; category:

   <A HREF="http://nia.nominet.org.uk/shortlist">http://nia.nominet.org.uk/shortlist</A>

There is an evening event where the winners will be announced, and
then a parliamentary reception a week later.  I have asked the local
London chapter leaders if they can attend the events with me.
