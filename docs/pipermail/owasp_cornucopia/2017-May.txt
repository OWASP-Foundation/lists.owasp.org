Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Printed deck availability from OWASP

Just a brief note. OWASP removed the hyperlink on the "get the cards" tab
for people to buy printed card decks. This is because they have run out of
stock, and are in the process of re-ordering.

I understand that OWASP has sold 2,500 copies of Cornucopia. My guess is
that Blackfoot UK have given away up to another 2,000, so maybe 4,500 in
total which is great. I believe book publishers celebrate if they manage to
sell 5,000 copies in print.

Regards Colin

Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Mobile App for Cornucopia decks?
Message-ID: <5920bec9-0926-6bb5-29e1-2daf770b548c@owasp.org>

Hello List,

I have been using Cornucopia for two years to teach security requirements
to pre-graduate students.

For us the main problem is that we can't have as many decks as we wish, as they are somewhat expensive to print or to buy already printed.

So I've been wondering if we could create a dependet project for having the decks as a mobile application, which will simple show the cards randomly, and the text for the rules. 

Of course the source of truth will be the source xml data file.

What do you think?

Regards,

Felipe Zipitria.

Hello Felipe

Thanks for telling us about how you use Cornucopia.

OWASP sells the decks at $8 per pack, but they are out of stock at the
moment. Although the print source files are available, I imagine it would
be hard to beat that price with a small quantity. A mobile app that deals
cards in some way would be a useful alternative, and as you say, basing it
on the source XML data would be best - we keep that up-to-date.

The XML file is here, as a zip (because the wiki doesn't let up upload .xml
files):


https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Cornucopia-deck-ecommercewebsite-XML.zip

As far as I know, no-one else is using the source XML file currently, and
we need to update its structure/schema anyway. Co-leader Dario is working
on a Spanish translation which we need to add to the XML in some way. Then
it might be nice if the mobile app you are proposing could have language
selection too?

So in summary yes! Some mobile app would be a great contribution, but could
you or someone else help improve the XML file first, so it supports
multiple languages?

Best

Excellent,

For the translation itself, I used to do translations for ZAP and they
are using crowdin (which is free for open source projects) to help in
the translation.

Any open source project leader can request a translation project there
using: https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request

That will help a lot with the translations.

Dario, let me know how are you planning on doing the translation, so we
can collaborate!

I will ask some of my colleagues for advice on having a nice and
flexible XML for this purposes.

Felipe.
