Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] Questions about Cornucopia and ASVS 4.0
Message-ID: <CAFT8z4hSKQHK3awgbc+vuEUhd1e=xNAjfBTm85y_wuC2nWn8JA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
I'm writing because I am promoting the use of Cornucopia in my work and I
would like to support them in the project. Additionally, I have the query
about whether any work will be done to relate Cornucopia with the ASVS.
Finally, I would also like to tell you that I've translated Cornucopia into
Spanish if you can use them.
Thank you very much for your attention and reply.

Hello Colin,

Thanks for your reply. Of course, please give them my email to coordinate.
I have translated Cornucopia and the SAFECode stories, I have also created
a traceability matrix. Artifact to be used by the Information Security team
of the company where I work. I could show it to you in case you find it
interesting also to attach it to Cornucopia as an additional artifac to
manage Security in Agile. My e-mails are: mgomezsanchez at bcp.com.pe and
maxgsv7.86 at gmail.com. The first is from the company where I work and the
second is from the staff. Any questions you have please write me to both.
Thank you!
