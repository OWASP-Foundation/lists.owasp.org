Hello Colin and Team,

Yes, we are actually still reviewing it. As you know, we used the
Cornucopia project as the standard for excellence for our OWASP Projects.
Because of your work, we are developing a far more rigorous process for
review. I hope to have more information for you after the holidays. Thank
you for your patience, Colin and Team.

	v1.03
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBkjYvgK69-DhZbyDajn66jvy4ZmkZGVGg0JvhoF0jWptw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

The data used for the text and cross-referencing on the Cornucopia
cards has been converted into a standalone XML file, available at:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Cornucopia-deck-ecommercewebsite-XML.zip

This might help some people use the data in other outputs. The project
pages have been updated.

If anyone can help improve the XML structure, I would be pleased to hear.

Subject: [Owasp_cornucopia] tarot sized cards - printerstudio.com
Message-ID: <CA+aoS_044Wph41uiqwiQ0HesWL1Tk=m=iOG=KkcQ1rAJbjs6Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for all the work on this project.  In the past I've printed the EOP
game on tarot sized cards on printerstudio.com and played it a few times.
 I LOVE the idea of an enterprise webpage edition, so thanks for the effort
to pull this off.

I targeted the tarot sized card because the bigger size would help
accommodate the amount of text.  Their sizing guide was very helpful in
figuring out the exact size:
http://www.printerstudio.com/pops/pc-temp-guide.html

I tried a hundred permutations of this, so here are instructions on how I
got it to work. The challenge is the web-page auto-scales to the size of
their card, but this puts the number and right side of the text in the
"cut-zone" meaning it might get cut off.  So these are the steps I took to
create the images and resize them:

1. Start with the print ready pdf zip file
-  (I've no MS office software so this zip file was very helpful)

2. Create individual images from the pdf using gimp (it doesn't support pdf
import)
 a. open the pdf files with gimp - a pdf import wizard will pop up
 b. select all images
 c. select open pages as "images" instead of "layers"
 d. set the height to 2994
   - the width will snap to 1794 to preserve the ratio
   - (2994 is double 1497, the height of a tarot card from the printing
bleed-area, not the cut edge.  It's double because the page complains of
low resolution if I give the exact dimensions)
 e. click import, (see attached picture)
 e. export each image.  This is a bit tedious.

3. Scale each image to tarot size
  a. Install gimp-plugin-registry to get "David's Batch Processor"
    - on ubuntu: sudo apt-get install gimp-plugin-registry
  b. open "David's Batch Processor"
    - open gimp
    - click "Filter -> Batch -> Batch Process
  c. add all file on the "input" tab
  d. add a prefix or postfix on the "rename" tab, something like "scaled"
  e. On the Resize tab do this:
   - click enable
   - click absolute
   - set width = 1794 and height = 2994
   - set Fit = "Exact"
   (changes ratio to match tarot)
  f. click "Start"

4. Resize again with padding (I tried lots of ways to remove this step but
I didn't like the results)
  a. clear input files,
  b. add "-scaled" images to input
  c. change prefix of postfix on the "rename" tab, something like "padded"
  d. On the Resize tab do this:
    - change width to 1894 x 3094
    - change Fit = "Padded"
  f. click "Start"

(Step four shows my inability to wield the power of gimp - I feel like a
toddler with a chain saw.  I'm not sure why it works. It still isn't quite
right, but its close enough)

5. import the padded-scaled images into printerstudio on a tarot size card
project with custom front and back images.

I hope this helps someone.  Thanks again.

- Cam

Great, thanks for sharing this information and the steps you took. I
have added a link from the project wiki's "Cards" tab to the message
details

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia#tab=Cards


and your name here:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia#tab=Acknowledgements


Sorry about using Word... the wiki doesn't support .otf but I could
just have done a Zip I suppose.

Regards

Colin
