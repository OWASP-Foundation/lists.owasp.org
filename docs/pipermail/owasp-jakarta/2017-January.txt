I would like to invite you and representatives/developers of your org to
join the FOSSASIA Summit in Singapore from 17th - 19th March, 2017.

The FOSSASIA Summit is one of the biggest open tech gatherings in Asia
established since 2009, with more than 3000 participants. Topics range from
open hardware, to design, graphics and software. Dedicated tracks of 2017
include Software, DevOps, Hardware, Internet & Society, Kernel Hacking,
Health, Citizen Science .. and more.

I have learned about your project from GSoC. It would be fantastic to
connect you with our community, users and companies in Asia.

For more information about the summit, please have a look at our event site
http://2017.fossasia.org. We would also love to receive talk submissions
from your community 2017.fossasia.org/speaker-registration.

All the best from Vietnam,
