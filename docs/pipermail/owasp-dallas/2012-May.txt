REMINDER ?Registration for our June 4-8 CISSP Intensive Review Course has just been extended to Friday, May 18th at 5:00 PM (only three days from now). Fee is only $1,200 for all five days, and includes 40 hours of CPE.

This CISSP Intensive Review Course will prepare you for the CISSP exam. Specifics and registration can be found at http://www.isacantx.org/Current_Events/r/554

NOTE: We may currently be one registrant short of meeting the minimum needed to "make" this class. At only $1,200, this is a steal, so please sign-up now, and pass this information to any IT audit or security team members that may be interested in attending.
