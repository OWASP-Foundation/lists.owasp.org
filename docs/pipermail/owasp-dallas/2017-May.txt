Hi all

Just a couple quick announcements:


   - The organizers of Cyber Security Summit: Dallas have generously
   offered free admittance to OWASP Dallas members.  The event is this Friday,
   May 5th.  If you are interested, sign up here:
   https://cybersummitusa.com/OWASP/


   - I'm still trying to sort out our upcoming schedule so stay tuned.  I
   hope to make an announcement about the May meeting by the end of the week.


   - As always... if you are interested in speaking, hosting, or
   sponsoring, then please reach out to me and let me know :)

Thanks!
Denis
