Hi all

It was a great 2017 and we had a lot of cool topics on a variety of topics:

   - OWASP projects: Defect Dojo and Glue
   - Cloud: micro-services and AWS security tools
   - Automotive hacking
   - SecDevOps
   - AppSec program initiatives

I really liked how we were able to dig into some OWASP projects and I hope
to continue that trend in 2018.  To that end, our first meeting in January
will be about the new OWASP Top 10 that was just released.  You can find
the meetup announcement here:

https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-The-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-Meetup/events/245673393/

The remainder of the calendar is wide open so we are looking for speakers,
hosts, and sponsors :)  While I'd love for the speakers to be from the DFW
area so we can learn about how our local peers approach App Sec, I
understand that's tough so I will continue to look to bring outside
speakers when needed.

There won't be any December meeting, so have a happy new year!

Denis
