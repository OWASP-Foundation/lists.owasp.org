Chapter Meeting
ISSA NTX - June Meeting 2011

11:30 AM  - 1:00 PM

Topic:  The State of Web Application Security

Summary:
It's no secret that more and more commerce is being conducted via Web
applications. Web-based applications are convenient for consumers and
allow vendors to get applications online quickly to reach those
consumers. This trend has also created a variety of privacy and
security concerns that affect all companies transacting business over
the Web.  Recently, Barracuda networks co-sponsored a research study
conducted by the Ponemon Institute titled &quot;The State of Web
Application Security&quot; that revealed that these concerns are keenly
felt by web application administrators.  However, a major disconnect
exists as appropriate countermeasures to these threats are either
ineffective or completely non-existent.  Join us for an informative
seminar to learn:
&#8226;	More about our revealing research
&#8226;	Why Web applications are under attack
&#8226;	What hackers are doing to compromise Web applications
&#8226;	How to mitigate this risk

Speaker:  Grant Murphy, Vice President of Enterprise Solutions,
Barracuda Networks
