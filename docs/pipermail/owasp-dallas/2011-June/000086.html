<PRE>Hey Dallas OWASPers,

I've posted the registration for July's meeting, please register early, and please advertise this event to others that are interested in application security.  

<A HREF="http://owaspdallasmtgjuly.eventbrite.com/">http://owaspdallasmtgjuly.eventbrite.com/</A>

We're looking forward to another great presentation coming up on July 6th by Ben Broussard.
Ben is an active member of the Austin OWASP Chapter, and comes to use with high praise from presentation he's given in Austin.  


I also want to let you know now that we will not be meeting during the regularly scheduled time in August.  Our regular meeting time would compete with Blackhat, and several of the members, speakers and sponsors will be in Las Vegas for that week.  

Instead, we're planning a social mixer for the end of August, so stay tuned for details on that.  


Thanks again for a great OWASP experience in Dallas so far, let's keep it up!  
Remember, this isn't Fight Club, we allow and encourage you to talk about the Dallas OWASP chapter with anyone and everyone that's interested!

Thanks again, see you all next month!

-Ryan W Smith
