Hi OWASP members!


 

My name is Emily Carter and I work with AIM Consulting here in Dallas, Texas. I wanted to reach out to discuss an opportunity I have with my company for a full time opportunity here in the Dallas area. Seeing that OWASP is a security group, I wanted to reach out about a Security opportunity here in Dallas. This is an application security professional working on application security vulnerability issues for a major fortune 50 company here in Dallas. If you or someone you know may be intersted, please send me your resume via email, and we will set up a time to discuss this opportunity in more detail. Thanks so much!

 

Regards,
