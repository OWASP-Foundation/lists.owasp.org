<PRE>From the prompt replies it seems there is a fair amount of interest in
getting the Dallas chapter moving again.  It will be interesting to hear
from Andrea.

Fortify is in to support a Dallas owasp chapter as well.  We have a
couple folks in dallas that will help in any way needed.  (Within
reason). :-)

I've just subscribed to the Dallas Chapter mailing lists and I'm
wondering if this chapter is still active or has gone dormant.  

 

I'm not sure how large or small this mailing list is so I'm sending this
email to try and establish the level of interest in OWASP activities.  

I work at Southwest Securities Inc. in downtown Dallas and manage a
group of systems and web programmers.  Over the past two years we've
been redesigning many of our web sites and adopting secure programming
practices has been a major focus.

 

Please reply if you have any information/updates on OWASP activates for
the Dallas chapter.

 

 I think the Dallas chapter has been dormant for a while.  Andrea
Wendeln (CC'd on this email) has been working to get the chapter back up
and running with some folks and I believe they are trying to have a
meeting here pretty soon.  Andrea?

 

Thanks,

 

Dan
