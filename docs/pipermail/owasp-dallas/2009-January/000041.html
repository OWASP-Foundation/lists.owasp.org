<PRE>Fellow OWASP members and enthusiasts,

 

I would love to attend events in the future, but I am typically
available for lunch events only on Mon, Tue, Fri, or Sat.  I have more
flexibility in the evening.

 

Thank you,

Dallas OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, February 25, 2009

Topic: Vulnerability Management in an Application Security World

Presenter: Dan Cornell, Principal, Denim Group

Date: Wednesday, February 25, 2009 11:30am - 1:30pm. Lunch will be
provided.

Location:

UTD Campus - Galaxy Room of the Student Union, Room SU 2.602

800 West Campbell Road
Richardson, TX 75080-3021

Abstract:

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and
code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the
underlying risk.  Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more
challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level
vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of
security teams with application development teams and require security
managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped
development and release schedules.  In addition, fixes require changes
to custom application code and application-specific business logic
rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often
sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.

This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter
while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as
outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with
development teams.  Similarities and differences between security teams'
practice of vulnerability management and development teams' practice of
defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy
communication between these groups.
