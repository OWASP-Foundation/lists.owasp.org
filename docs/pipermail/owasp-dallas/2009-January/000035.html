<PRE>Howdy folks!  We noticed that this chapter has been dormant for awhile.
I'm excited about the prompt replies and I'm happy to report that we
are, in fact, moving forward with getting the chapter back up and
running.  Leah Teutsch from UTD, Don McMillian from ACS, and I have
committed to quarterly meetings in 2009.  That being said, our first
meeting is scheduled for either the last week of February or the first
week of March on the UTD campus at lunchtime.  Lunch will even be
provided for our first meeting of the year. Dan Cornell, the primary
author of sprajax, the open source tool for assessing the security of
AJAX-enabled web applications, will be the speaker.  (if you must, you
can read about Dan here: <A HREF="http://www.denimgroup.com/about_team_dan.html">http://www.denimgroup.com/about_team_dan.html</A>)

Once a date and location on the UTD campus have been confirmed, I will
report back to the group.  In the meantime, thank you for your interest,
and if you want to help, just let me know.

Cheers,
Andrea

&gt;<i>From the prompt replies it seems there is a fair amount of interest in
</I>getting the Dallas chapter moving again.  It will be interesting to hear
from Andrea.

couple folks in dallas that will help in any way needed.  (Within
reason). :-)

I've just subscribed to the Dallas Chapter mailing lists and I'm
wondering if this chapter is still active or has gone dormant.  

 

I'm not sure how large or small this mailing list is so I'm sending this
email to try and establish the level of interest in OWASP activities.  

I work at Southwest Securities Inc. in downtown Dallas and manage a
group of systems and web programmers.  Over the past two years we've
been redesigning many of our web sites and adopting secure programming
practices has been a major focus.

 

Please reply if you have any information/updates on OWASP activates for
the Dallas chapter.

 

 I think the Dallas chapter has been dormant for a while.  Andrea
Wendeln (CC'd on this email) has been working to get the chapter back up
and running with some folks and I believe they are trying to have a
meeting here pretty soon.  Andrea?

 

Thanks,

 

Dan
