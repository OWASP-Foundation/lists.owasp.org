I wanted to give everyone a quick update of upcoming OWASP Dallas events:

Of course, everyone knows about the Chapter meeting on March 2 with Matt Tesauro - http://dallasowasp.eventbrite.com/
We nearly 50 registered already, registration is always free so if you plan to come, please register.
Veracode has offered to sponsor the lunch for this meeting, we'll be having RolyPoly sandwiches, chips and drinks
Matt is bringing a signed copy of the OWASP Top 10 Web App Security Risk to raffle off at the end.  All that are registered and in attendance will be eligible
Matt will also bring a limited number of printed OWASP Live CDs with all the testing tools, these will be given out on a first come first serve basis, so make sure to arrive early.

We'll also be hosting a DFW Infosec Happy Hour, on March 2nd at 4:30 - http://dfwinfosechappyhour.eventbrite.com/
This is the first in a series of regular happy hour events open to the entire DFW Infosec community.
This event will be at Iron Cactus is downtown, everyone will be on their own, but in the future we may try to attain sponsorship
The intent is to bring the DFW infosec community together in a social and organizationally agnostic way
Anyone involved or interested in the infosec community is encouraged to register and attend.

I'll be presenting a devloper-centric introduction to webApp security at a CoHabitat in Uptown the night before on March 1st - http://sectalks.eventbrite.com/
This is an open talk, intended to plant the security seed in the web2.0 developer community
CoHabitat is a CoWorking house, that more than 12 Web2.0,Facebook,Google, and Mobile startups share and support
The purpose of this presentation is to build a bridge between the cutting edge application development community and the OWASP organization
Everyone is encouraged to register and attend, from either the developer or security communities.

Thanks again everyone, I look forward to seeing all of you next week!

-Ryan
