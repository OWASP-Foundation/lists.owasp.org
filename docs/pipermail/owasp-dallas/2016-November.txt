Subject: [Owasp-dallas] Last meeting of the year
Message-ID: <CADAaQBZGprkF7QoO2703uvghK++Mu9ML1nt5XuudfSHmL8Aq7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Just a friendly reminder to RSVP for our meeting tomorrow using this link:

https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-The-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-Meetup/events/233916176/

This will be our last meeting of the year and we'll pick things up again in
January.  Thanks to all those that volunteered to speak, host, and/or
sponsor our meetings this year!  We'll still need more volunteers for 2017
so if you or your company is interested in helping us out it would be
greatly appreciated!

Finally, I received an email from TEKsystems about an Application Security
Engineer with Health Management Systems in Irving, TX. It is a full-time
position and can pay $110-125k. If you are interested I can put you in
touch with the recruiter.

Hope to see everybody tomorrow night!

Thanks!
Denis
