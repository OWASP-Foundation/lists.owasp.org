Hey guys,

If anyone is planning to go to LASCON and hasn't bought tickets yet, let me know and I can transfer my registration to you.  I didn't realize it was transferrable until now, but I'm currently on my way to Brazil, and will be there during LASCON.  

If you haven't made plans for LASCON yet, check out the agenda at http://www.lascon.org/.  It looks like it with be another great year, I wish I could make it, but I highly recommend you make the short trip to Austin if you're in the area.   

If you're still looking for tickets, send me an email directly with the info for the mandatory fields listed in the image below (red *).  I'll have Internet access until about 8am tomorrow, then will be back online sometime tomorrow evening.  

Take care, and GO RANGERS!
