Subject: [Owasp-dallas] OWASP Dallas: September meeting
Message-ID: <CADAaQBbESFx1DaPGWsAKotENKfXLEF2FUNV0oAfwSiBPTCe11A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

We are excited to announce a September meeting on Application Security
Trends hosted at the Goldman Sachs office in Irving.  We have another
meeting scheduled for October (more details can be found at the OWASP
Dallas site <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Dallas>).  We are hoping to
squeeze in 1 more event -- most likely a social gathering -- before the end
of the year too.

There will be pizza served at the September meeting so *please RSVP via our
Meetup page
<http://www.meetup.com/Dallas-The-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-Meetup/>*
so we can get an accurate headcount.

Full details for the September meeting can be found below.

Thanks!
Denis Sheridan
