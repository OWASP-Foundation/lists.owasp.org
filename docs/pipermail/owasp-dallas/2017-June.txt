Hi all

A quick note to share some recent announcements:


   - Our meeting this month will be on Tuesday, June 20th at Toyota's
   office in Plano.  The topic will be "From Hot Rodding to Hacking, Securing
   the Modern Automobile" present by Art Dahnert.  Please RSVP here:
   https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-The-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-Meetup/events/240487098/


   - Our meeting in July is set for Wednesday, July 19th at Goldman Sachs'
   office in Irving.  The topic will be "IoT Security Landscape: Survey &
   Analysis" present by Mark Szewczul.  Please RSVP here:
   https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-The-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-Meetup/events/240488143/


   - The slides from the April meeting presentation "AWS Security: Staying
   on Top of the Cloud" have been posted to the OWASP Dallas wiki.  Here's the
   URL: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Dallas


   - OWASP's annual conference APPSEC USA 2017 will be held in Orlando, FL
   this September.  This is a great opportunity to meet other App Sec
   professionals and find out how other individuals/companies are tackling the
   same security issues.  I've gone the past 2 years and it's been a blast.
   Full details here: https://2017.appsecusa.org/


   - I'm working filling out the meeting schedule for the end of the year.
   There are roughly 2-3 meetings that still need a location, food/drink
   sponsor, and speaker.  If you are interested in volunteering for any
   combination of those, please reach out to me :)

Thanks!
Denis
