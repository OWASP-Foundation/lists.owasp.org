Hi all

I wanted to thank everyone that came out to our meeting earlier this
week... it was the highest attended meeting that I've seen by far.  If you
missed it, you can check out photos of the event here:

Also, just a reminder... our meeting host and sponsor, Capital One in
Plano, is currently looking for app sec professionals, so you can send your
resume to me and I will make sure it finds its way there.

I'll be sending out the July meeting announcement soon.  Hope to see you
all there!

Thanks!
Denis

Hi all

I wanted to send out another reminder about how you can help the OWASP
Dallas chapter:

   1. *Volunteer to speak.*  We love to have folks from the local chapter
   talk share their security knowledge with the rest of us.  I'm sure that
   there is a lot that we can learn from one another... don't be shy!
   2. *Volunteer to host a meeting. * If your company has room to
   accommodate about 30 people (perhaps even more based on our last meeting),
   a projector, and a willingness to support the local app sec community, then
   please let us know.  This is an easy way to expose developers to security
   that otherwise might not come out to a meeting.
   3. *Sponsor meeting food & drinks.*  We typically order pizza and sodas
   for our meetings and it is usually around $250.  A fed OWASP community is a
   happy one :)

Please take a moment to consider if you can help in any of the
above-mentioned ways.  We are also open to comments and suggestions, so
please feel free to send those along if you have any too.

I will be sending out the July meeting announcement tomorrow.

Thanks!
Denis

Subject: [Owasp-dallas] Reverse Engineering training in Austin,
	TX - July 21 & 22
Message-ID: <BY2PR0201MB154396A9475388B5D24462AAD0240@BY2PR0201MB1543.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

Austin OWASP is hosting a two-day training on July 21 and July 22 on reverse engineering.

This class will be at no cost to attendees thanks to National Instruments, Austin OWASP and the instructor.

Why learn reverse engineering?


1.    To debug applications

2.    To get a deeper understanding of how an application works and interacts with other applications

3.    To learn how applications are exploited

4.    As a foundation for malware analysis

5.    As a foundation for binary exploitation

6.    As a foundation for vulnerability research

More information and sign up is here: https://austin-owasp-re.eventbrite.com

Thanks,

Matt Pardo
Education & Training, Austin OWASP
