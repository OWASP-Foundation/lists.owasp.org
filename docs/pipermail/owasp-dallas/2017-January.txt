Hi all

Just a quick note with a few announcements:

A big thanks to Joseph Konieczka for presenting at our first meeting of
2017 and also for generously donating two copies of Iron-Clad Java to our
chapter's library.  Please let me know if you are interesting to checking
out a copy and I'll bring it to our next meeting.  Book details below:

We've announced the February meeting.  It will be back at the Capital One
office in Plano.  Jack Mannino will be presenting on secure architecture
with respect to microservices.  Please RSVP using the following link:

We are close to announcing the March meeting too so please keep an eye out
for that as well.

Thanks!
Denis
