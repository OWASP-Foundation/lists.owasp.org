Dallas OWASP Chapter June 2009 Meeting

 

Topic: Application Security Compromise Trends

Presenter: Branden R. Williams, Director, PCI Consulting Practice,
VeriSign

Date: Monday, June 15, 2009 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM

 

Location: UTD Campus - Galaxy Room of the Student Union, Room SU 2.602.

Doors open at 11:00 AM.

 

Lunch: Bring your own lunch or purchase lunch at one of the many
fast-food

restaurants located on the top floor of the Student Union. 

 

Topic Details: Application security is more important in today's defense
against

cyber warfare. Recent compromise trends show that applications are much
more

vulnerable to attack than networks and hosts, and the most successful
attacks

require some application component. Branden will discuss recent
application

compromise trends based on his experience in investigating PCI breaches
over

the last several years.

 

Presenter Bio: Branden R. Williams, CISSP, CISM, is the Director of the
PCI

Consulting Practice at VeriSign and regularly assists top global
retailers, financial

institutions, and multinationals with their information security
initiatives. He was

recently named Payment Security Professional of the Year for 2008 by the

Society of Payment Security Professionals. Read his blog at
