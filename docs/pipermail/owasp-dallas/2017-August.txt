Hi all

A few notes:

   leader, Greg Anderson, will be talking about DefectDojo.  RSVP here:

   - The September meeting is set for Wednesday, September 13th at

   - OWASP's annual conference APPSEC USA 2017 will be held in Orlando, FL
   this September.  This is a great opportunity to meet other App Sec
   professionals and find out how other individuals/companies are tackling the
   same security issues.  Full details here: https://2017.appsecusa.org/


   - The details for the October and November meetings are being firmed up
   soon and meetup announcements will be made shortly.  If you are interested
   in hosting/sponsoring/speaking for next year, please let me know :)

Thanks!
Denis
