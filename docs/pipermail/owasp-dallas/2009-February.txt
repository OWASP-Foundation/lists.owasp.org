Dallas OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, February 25, 2009

Topic: Vulnerability Management in an Application Security World

Presenter: Dan Cornell, Principal, Denim Group

Date: Wednesday, February 25, 2009 11:30am ? 1:30pm. Lunch will be provided.

Location:

UTD Campus - Galaxy Room of the Student Union, Room SU 2.602

Abstract:

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk.  Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of security teams with application development teams and require security managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped development and release schedules.  In addition, fixes require changes to custom application code and application-specific business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.

This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with development teams.  Similarities and differences between security teams? practice of vulnerability management and development teams? practice of defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication between these groups.

 

Presenter Bio:

Dan Cornell has over ten years of experience architecting, developing and securing web-based software systems. As a Principal of Denim Group, he leads the organization?s technology team overseeing methodology development and project execution for Denim Group?s customers. He also heads the Denim Group application security research team, investigating the application of secure coding and development techniques to the improvement of web based software development methodologies.
