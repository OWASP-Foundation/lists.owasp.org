September Meeting

*When:* Thursday September 17th, 2015 from 5:30PM ? 6:30 PM

*Topic: *Application Security Trends



Goldman Sachs

Connection Drive, Irving, TX 75039, Dallas, TX



Securing web applications and their supporting services is a challenging
task. According to the 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report
(DBIR), the top three industries affected were the same as the previous
years: Public, Information and Financial Services. City-data.com states,
these are also major economic sectors in the Dallas area. The DBIR also
concludes, in 60% of cases, attackers were able to compromise an
organization within minutes. Ultimately, more can be done to safeguard
applications.

There are several techniques one can implement to protect applications that
consume inbound data. Some defensive strategies have been around for some
time, whereas others are emerging. This talk will take a look at current
and emerging standards and trends that software development teams can use.
Today, it is not always clear how a team should proceed to secure the code
responsible for handling inbound data. You'll get a better idea of what
works, what's promising and what's missing.

*Who:* Stephen Pasco is a Vice President of Application Risk at Goldman
Sachs based in Irving where he is currently focused on vulnerability
testing. Prior to joining Goldman Sachs Stephen was employed at Disney on
the Security and Compliance Team where he performed security/application
vulnerability assessments. He also architected and developed security
tools, wrote policies, and managed software security fixes. One aspect of
that job was to frequently visit Disneyland parks searching for WiFi
vulnerabilities.




Thanks,
Matt Parsons

Subject: [Owasp-dallas] REMINDER: October 7 Meeting RSVP
Message-ID: <CADAaQBYnR6fpFuf22NnUhb7h_C1UQYzbfRVo0dA-M=7eFLEFKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Thanks to everyone that turned out last week and made it a great meeting.
It was really cool to see such a large group of people come together.

I wanted to remind everyone about our next meeting on *Wednesday, October
7th at 11:30 AM* once again located the Goldman Sachs office in Irving.
Please RSVP on our meetup site
<http://www.meetup.com/Dallas-The-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-Meetup/events/225100298/>
so
we can get a headcount for pizza and drinks.

I will also be sending out a survey to poll the group on preferred meeting
times, locations, topic recommendations, etc.  Stay tuned for that.

Thanks!
Denis
