Subject: [Owasp-dallas] Reminder: Open Web Application Security Project
	Meeting Tuesday, Sept. 15 @ First American
Message-ID: <5DC00D3430370A428A709B1E8BF356660166CA2E@UTDEVS20.campus.ad.utdallas.edu>

When: September 15, 2009, 11:30am - 1:30pm 

Topic: Detective Work for Testers. Finding Workflow-based Defects. 

Workflow-based security defects in Web applications are especially difficult to identify because they evade traditional, point-and-scan vulnerability detection techniques. Understanding these potential defects and why black-box scanners typically miss them, are key to creating a testing strategy for successful detection and mitigation. Rafal Los describes the critical role that testers play in assessing application work flows and how business process-based testing techniques can uncover these flaws. Rafal demystifies the two main types of workflow-based application vulnerabilities-business process logic vulnerabilities and parameter-based vulnerabilities-and provides you with a sound basis to improve your testing strategies. Become a security testing sleuth and learn to find the workflow-based security defects before your system is compromised. 

Who: Rafal Los, Sr. Web Security Specialist, HP Software 

Senior Security Specialist with Hewlett-Packard's Application Security Center (ASC), Rafal Los has more than thirteen years of experience in network and system design, security policy and process design, risk analysis, penetration testing, and consulting. For the past eight years, he has focused on information security and risk management, leading security architecture teams, and managing successful enterprise security programs for General Electric and other Fortune 100 companies, as well as SMB enterprises.
