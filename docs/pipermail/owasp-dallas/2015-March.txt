Good Morning,Not exactly sure if this is the best place to post this or if there is a set format for job postings. However I will give you as much details as possible. This person can come from a security, development, or testing background. Title is less important than the knowledge of OWASP and putting a application through the Top Ten. Knowledge around PCI and credit cards is a major plus.?
