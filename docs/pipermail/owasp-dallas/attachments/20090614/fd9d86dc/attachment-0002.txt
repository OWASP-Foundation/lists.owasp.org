Topic Details: Application security is more important in today's defense against
cyber warfare. Recent compromise trends show that applications are much more
vulnerable to attack than networks and hosts, and the most successful attacks
require some application component. Branden will discuss recent application
compromise trends based on his experience in investigating PCI breaches over
the last several years.
