Just a quick reminder our OWASP Dallas meeting is tomorrow at Goldman Sachs
at 11:30 am.  Goldman Sachs was kind enough to host and Cigital was kind
enough to sponsor the pizza. The speaker will be talking about software
security.  We look forward to seeing everyone there.

Thanks,
Matt

Hi all

We put together six questions that we'd like to have the group weigh in
on.  It's mostly about logistics for our meetings and input on future
presentations for next year.  Please take a few minutes and fill it out.
We'd really appreciate it :)

Thanks!
