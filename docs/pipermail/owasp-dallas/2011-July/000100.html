<PRE>Fellow OWASPers,
Hopefully by now you've heard the buzz around last year's Lonestar
Application Security Conference (LASCON).  The conference was hosted by the
Austin OWASP Chapter and featured some of the world's top security
researchers including Robert &quot;RSnake&quot; Hansen, Samy Kamkar, Joe Jarzombek,
and many more.  In it's first year, LASCON had over 160 attendees and the
feedback was outstanding.  Here's just a few of examples of what 2010 LASCON
attendees had to say about the conference:

 *With the lineup of presenters that you have for the LASCON Conference, I
can't afford not to go. *
*
- Ian Robertson *

*Just wanted to drop the LASCON organizers a note about how much I enjoyed
the conference last Friday. Good venue, good food, good presentations, and
good people.
- Joel Burrow *

*Thanks for understanding how us geeks think and putting on a conference
that we can really enjoy being a part of.
- Jay Paz *

With so much positive feedback coming out of LASCON 2010 it was a no brainer
for our team to do it again this year.  We've already received commitments
from Jeremiah Grossman, John Steven, Michael Howard, and many more.
Needless to say, this year's conference is gonna rock and we want you to be
a part of it!  We've got special Early-Bird Pricing good through the end of
July.  For the next two weeks *OWASP members can attend LASCON for only
$75.  Non-members can attend LASCON for $125* and that includes a $50 OWASP
membership of which 40% goes to support your local chapter.  You may have
missed out on last year's conference, but you won't want to miss what we
have in store for *LASCON 2011 happening October 28, 2011 at the Norris
Conference Center in Austin, TX*.  And be sure to plan on sticking around
for the LASCON Happy Hour sponsored by Trustwave.  The mechanical bull is
back!  We'll see you at LASCON!

Register for LASCON today at <A HREF="http://www.regonline.com/lascon2011">http://www.regonline.com/lascon2011</A>

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol &amp; James Wickett
LASCON 2011 Co-Chairs
