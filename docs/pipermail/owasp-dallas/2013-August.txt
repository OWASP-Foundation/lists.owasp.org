*Where:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C


*Title:* Static Code Analysis: Is it safe to go back in the water?

*Abstract:* With a reputation for high cost, difficult deployment, and
high skillset requirements, static analysis has been put on the back
burner in many app sec programs in favor of activities like pen testing
with lower barriers to entry. As tools and techniques mature, people are
moving beyond pen testing and re-investigating static analysis to bring
more precise and earlier-in-the-dev-cycle improvements to code security
quality. Join two leading industry experts in a discussion of current
security code review practices, real-world case studies, what works and
what doesn't, plus technical and business drivers you need to know to
get a code review capability off the ground in your organization.
