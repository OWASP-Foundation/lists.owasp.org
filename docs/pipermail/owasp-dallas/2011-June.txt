Subject: [Owasp-dallas] OWASP Dallas July Meeting Registration is now posted!
Message-ID: <3F11FFFD-C6A0-4F6C-9502-D14C98908F94@owasp.org>

Hey Dallas OWASPers,

I've posted the registration for July's meeting, please register early, and please advertise this event to others that are interested in application security.  

http://owaspdallasmtgjuly.eventbrite.com/

We're looking forward to another great presentation coming up on July 6th by Ben Broussard.
Ben is an active member of the Austin OWASP Chapter, and comes to use with high praise from presentation he's given in Austin.  


I also want to let you know now that we will not be meeting during the regularly scheduled time in August.  Our regular meeting time would compete with Blackhat, and several of the members, speakers and sponsors will be in Las Vegas for that week.  

Instead, we're planning a social mixer for the end of August, so stay tuned for details on that.  


Thanks again for a great OWASP experience in Dallas so far, let's keep it up!  
Remember, this isn't Fight Club, we allow and encourage you to talk about the Dallas OWASP chapter with anyone and everyone that's interested!

Thanks again, see you all next month!

-Ryan W Smith

Topic:  The State of Web Application Security

Summary:
It's no secret that more and more commerce is being conducted via Web
applications. Web-based applications are convenient for consumers and
allow vendors to get applications online quickly to reach those
consumers. This trend has also created a variety of privacy and
security concerns that affect all companies transacting business over
the Web.  Recently, Barracuda networks co-sponsored a research study
conducted by the Ponemon Institute titled "The State of Web
Application Security" that revealed that these concerns are keenly
felt by web application administrators.  However, a major disconnect
exists as appropriate countermeasures to these threats are either
ineffective or completely non-existent.  Join us for an informative
seminar to learn:
?	More about our revealing research
?	Why Web applications are under attack
?	What hackers are doing to compromise Web applications
?	How to mitigate this risk

Speaker:  Grant Murphy, Vice President of Enterprise Solutions,
Barracuda Networks

Grant Murphy is Vice President of Enterprise Solutions managing
worldwide sales for the Barracuda Web Application Firewall and the Web
Filtering products at Barracuda Networks. Murphy brings significant
experience in the Web proxy/cache market and how these technologies
can be used to secure employee\'s Internet Access as well as the sites
they are accessing.  He has been a frequent speaker at many security
industry events worldwide over the past four years.  Prior to joining
Barracuda, he was responsible for sales of McAfee\'s Web and Email
filtering products.   Murphy earned his CISSP accreditation in March
of 2006.

Thanks for sharing, but I fail to see how a WAF vendor that was recently the victim of SQL Injection
attacks themselves will be able to tell me something I don't already know.

I'm not defending the vendor, or entirely disagreeing with this comment, but this is not an appropriate response to share on this list.  

This is a provocative personal opinion, which you're entitled to, but everyone doesn't need to know the reason anyone else is or is not attending.  
Furthermore,  a comment like this is likely to start an off topic flame session, which is against most mailing lists terms, if not explicitly this one.

Thanks for the feedback, but let's try to keep these type of inciteful comments/threads off this list.  

Thanks,
Ryan

Why should security vendors be exempt from criticism?  Furthermore, what's the harm in discussing it?
Is it too much to believe I simply stated something others were thinking, but wouldn't say for some
reason?

It's relevant in this situation, given the speaker works for a vendor that purports to protect against
SQLi attacks, and yet was a victim themselves.  I liken this to SOE trying to tell us how to protect
websites and the PS network from breaches, after having just been victims themselves.  So, no, I'm not
interested in hearing Barracuda's lessons learned, which will/would obviously be clouded with spin.
On the other hand, I _would_ be very keen to hear lessons learned from the incident response folks
that cleaned up the mess, identified root-cause, and influenced the remediation plan.

My sincere apologies to those offended by my opinion.

Just wondering if there is a company/person out there someone could
recommend for a penetration test.  In the past we have hired some that just
run Nessus and call it a day.

I would love to find one that puts a little more effort into the testing.

Thanks,

I don't know if you are looking for a long-term contract but I know that
ACS (Affiliated Computer Services) offers security services.

Their penetration testing is performed and may take several days because
they do a smattering of various things. I believe they even attempt to
do social engineering.

Of course it's been several years since I worked there, things may have
changed. 

 

Hope this information helps,

 

Alicia

Wayne,

You also might consider the Denim Group ( http://www.denimgroup.com/ ) - the team is located in San Antonio, TX and provides expertise in this field.

Good luck!

Dave Chronister taught the CEH class at TakeDownCon Dallas.  He spoke of
how his company provides so much more than Nessus reports, so you might
want to evaluate his services.

Just wondering if there is a company/person out there someone could
recommend for a penetration test.  In the past we have hired some that
just run Nessus and call it a day.

I would love to find one that puts a little more effort into the
testing.

Thanks,

Wayne

Subject: [Owasp-dallas] Chapter Meeting Next Week!
Message-ID: <0BAB1C37-7097-4FE5-A1E7-943B7C629042@gmail.com>

I just wanted to send a quick reminder to register for next week's chapter meeting with Ben Broussard walking through a secure authentication system design, development and test. 

You can get all the details and register at: http://owaspdallasmtgjuly.eventbrite.com/

Also, as a reminder, we will not have a regularly scheduled meeting in August due to Blackhat/Defcon, but we will be replacing it with a social and casual tech meeting in Uptown.  Details will be released at the July chapter meeting next week, so stay tuned.

See you all next week.

-Ryan
