I've just subscribed to the Dallas Chapter mailing lists and I'm
wondering if this chapter is still active or has gone dormant.  
 
I'm not sure how large or small this mailing list is so I'm sending this
email to try and establish the level of interest in OWASP activities.  
I work at Southwest Securities Inc. in downtown Dallas and manage a
group of systems and web programmers.  Over the past two years we've
been redesigning many of our web sites and adopting secure programming
practices has been a major focus.
 
Please reply if you have any information/updates on OWASP activates for
the Dallas chapter.
 
 
Thanks
 
 
Richard Hawker

 I think the Dallas chapter has been dormant for a while.  Andrea

I had expressed interest in starting (restarting?) the chapter a while  
back and the "official" OWASP people sent something to the one listed  
as the head of the Dallas chapter, but I have not heard anything back.

I have gotten the OK last fall from my management to host the meetings  
at our headquarters (Southwest Airlines, at Love Field in Dallas).   
That is a central location.

Is anyone on this list still really interested?  I would gladly just  
come rather than running it, though I don't mind stepping up to the  
plate for this.  I do have some possible connections for good speakers  
for at least a few of the meetings.

Howdy folks!  We noticed that this chapter has been dormant for awhile.
I'm excited about the prompt replies and I'm happy to report that we
are, in fact, moving forward with getting the chapter back up and
running.  Leah Teutsch from UTD, Don McMillian from ACS, and I have
committed to quarterly meetings in 2009.  That being said, our first
meeting is scheduled for either the last week of February or the first
week of March on the UTD campus at lunchtime.  Lunch will even be
provided for our first meeting of the year. Dan Cornell, the primary
author of sprajax, the open source tool for assessing the security of
AJAX-enabled web applications, will be the speaker.  (if you must, you
can read about Dan here: http://www.denimgroup.com/about_team_dan.html)

Once a date and location on the UTD campus have been confirmed, I will
report back to the group.  In the meantime, thank you for your interest,
and if you want to help, just let me know.

Cheers,
Andrea

I had expressed interest in starting (restarting?) the chapter a while  
back and the "official" OWASP people sent something to the one listed  
as the head of the Dallas chapter, but I have not heard anything back.
 
I have gotten the OK last fall from my management to host the meetings  
at our headquarters (Southwest Airlines, at Love Field in Dallas).   
That is a central location.
 
Is anyone on this list still really interested?  I would gladly just  
come rather than running it, though I don't mind stepping up to the  
plate for this.  I do have some possible connections for good speakers  
for at least a few of the meetings.

Wow, you guys beat us to the punch literally by one day!  Seriously, Dave and I have been trying to
get in touch with JD for a week to find out what he was planning for the chapter, if anything.

 

As far as we can tell, this chapter has been dead for a long time.

 

I'm the Director of Application Security at FishNet Security in Addison.  We also had plans to
resurrect the chapter, hosting the meetings in our office.

 

Sounds like we have plenty of desire.  I'm open to contributing, attending, running it, or any
combination.

 

How about we get a general consensus on an initial meeting date, get together, and work out the
details in a live setting?  We can order in pizza and get this sorted out.  Any takers?  What night is
best for everyone?

 

Cheers,

 

Joey Peloquin

can assist in any way.

Howdy folks!  We noticed that this chapter has been dormant for awhile.
I'm excited about the prompt replies and I'm happy to report that we
are, in fact, moving forward with getting the chapter back up and
running.  Leah Teutsch from UTD, Don McMillian from ACS, and I have
committed to quarterly meetings in 2009.  That being said, our first
meeting is scheduled for either the last week of February or the first
week of March on the UTD campus at lunchtime.  Lunch will even be
provided for our first meeting of the year. Dan Cornell, the primary
author of sprajax, the open source tool for assessing the security of
AJAX-enabled web applications, will be the speaker.  (if you must, you
can read about Dan here: http://www.denimgroup.com/about_team_dan.html)

Once a date and location on the UTD campus have been confirmed, I will
report back to the group.  In the meantime, thank you for your interest,
and if you want to help, just let me know.

Cheers,
Andrea

From the prompt replies it seems there is a fair amount of interest in
getting the Dallas chapter moving again.  It will be interesting to hear
from Andrea.

I've just subscribed to the Dallas Chapter mailing lists and I'm
wondering if this chapter is still active or has gone dormant.  

 

I'm not sure how large or small this mailing list is so I'm sending this
email to try and establish the level of interest in OWASP activities.  

I work at Southwest Securities Inc. in downtown Dallas and manage a
group of systems and web programmers.  Over the past two years we've
been redesigning many of our web sites and adopting secure programming
practices has been a major focus.

 

Please reply if you have any information/updates on OWASP activates for
the Dallas chapter.

 

 I think the Dallas chapter has been dormant for a while.  Andrea
Wendeln (CC'd on this email) has been working to get the chapter back up
and running with some folks and I believe they are trying to have a
meeting here pretty soon.  Andrea?

 

Thanks,

 

Dan

Dallas OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, February 25, 2009

Topic: Vulnerability Management in an Application Security World

Presenter: Dan Cornell, Principal, Denim Group

Date: Wednesday, February 25, 2009 11:30am - 1:30pm. Lunch will be
provided.

Location:

UTD Campus - Galaxy Room of the Student Union, Room SU 2.602

800 West Campbell Road
Richardson, TX 75080-3021

http://www.utdallas.edu/map/ 

 

Abstract:

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and
code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the
underlying risk.  Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more
challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level
vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of
security teams with application development teams and require security
managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped
development and release schedules.  In addition, fixes require changes
to custom application code and application-specific business logic
rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often
sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.

This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter
while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as
outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with
development teams.  Similarities and differences between security teams'
practice of vulnerability management and development teams' practice of
defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy
communication between these groups.

 

Presenter Bio:

Dan Cornell has over ten years of experience architecting, developing
and securing web-based software systems. As a Principal of Denim Group,
he leads the organization's technology team overseeing methodology
development and project execution for Denim Group's customers. He also
