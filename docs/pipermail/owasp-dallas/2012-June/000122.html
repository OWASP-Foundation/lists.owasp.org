<PRE>Good afternoon all,

I had a request from a gentleman looking for a local trainer to assist with an ongoing project here in Dallas. I have not talked with him and I don't have complete details, but, thought I would pass along in case some of you are interested. If you are looking for some extra work, meet the requirements he notes, and would like to discuss, please reach out to Bill directly. His info is included in his email.

Good luck and have a wonderful weekend.

Thank you,

Subject: Infosec-OWASP Trainer in Dallas

Gene:

My name is Bill Filandino and I am a Senior Consultant with Churchill &amp; Harriman, a Risk Management firm from Princeton, NJ.  As a part of an ongoing project in Dallas, TX we will be conducting Information Security Training for our client's employees and consultants who are professional, practicing software coders, (most of whom are consultants).  We are seeking to supplement our training staff with an accomplished architect with broad industry experience, who has delivered information security and OWASP-based training to professional development teams. We also seeking someone that has a background with PCI-DSS. Since our client is preparing for ISO27001 ISMS Certification, so there is a need to make certain that everyone in the organization received Information Security training, specific to their individual roles and responsibilities.

Although we are still working out the details, we estimate that the training will take place in mid to late July 2012 in Dallas, TX. The information security training for the software coders must also focus on the SANS-CWE Top 25 Software errors, in addition to the OWASP Top 10.

If you are aware of anyone with these qualifications I would appreciate it if you would have them contact me directly.  My contact information is listed below.

Regards,

Bill
