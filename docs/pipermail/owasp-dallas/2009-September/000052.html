When: September 15, 2009, 11:30am - 1:30pm 

Topic: Detective Work for Testers. Finding Workflow-based Defects. 

Workflow-based security defects in Web applications are especially difficult to identify because they evade traditional, point-and-scan vulnerability detection techniques. Understanding these potential defects and why black-box scanners typically miss them, are key to creating a testing strategy for successful detection and mitigation. Rafal Los describes the critical role that testers play in assessing application work flows and how business process-based testing techniques can uncover these flaws. Rafal demystifies the two main types of workflow-based application vulnerabilities-business process logic vulnerabilities and parameter-based vulnerabilities-and provides you with a sound basis to improve your testing strategies. Become a security testing sleuth and learn to find the workflow-based security defects before your system is compromised. 

Who: Rafal Los, Sr. Web Security Specialist, HP Software 

Senior Security Specialist with Hewlett-Packard's Application Security Center (ASC), Rafal Los has more than thirteen years of experience in network and system design, security policy and process design, risk analysis, penetration testing, and consulting.
