decided for 2015 we will be having three meetings for 2015 at the first
Wednesday in February, the first Wednesday in May and the First Wednesday

Subject: [Owasp-dallas] Don't Forget to Vote for the OWASP Board!
Message-ID: <CAFwvDexs0JHDz1sn_pHf4MXVnUyo1=aZxntSitu=1CSx-cORcA@mail.gmail.com>

Texas OWASPers!

If you are an official OWASP member, then you are eligible to vote in the
currently running OWASP Board Member election.  Not sure?  Check for your
name here:

https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheets/d/1yVkbYHVeAhcvCNvOFqwRTF6cdi-_nQ0CTVNoLYo0vC8/edit#gid=1153465796

There are two days left for you to cast your vote and even if you don't
know any of the candidates and would prefer to "abstain", we would ask that
you do so on the ballot so that we can make sure that all votes are
accounted for.  If you find your name on that list, then you should have
received an e-mail from owasp at simplyvoting.com providing you with
instructions on how to vote.  If you did not receive that, then most likely
it's either in your SPAM filters or you did what I did and clicked
"unsubscribe" on a past message.  The OWASP staff would love to get that
corrected for you so you can vote.

There are all sorts of resources out there for you to learn about the
different candidates ranging from the OWASP Podcast to these videos:

Candidate video #1
Matt Konda, Bil Corry and Tahir Khan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibze2gzv8Gs

Candidate video #2
Andrew van der Stock, Nigel Phair, Israel Bryski and Abbas Naderi.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YgOKhpNYc

Candidate video #3
Jim Manico, and Timur Khrotko.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jw2ZrarhT0

I'm not here to support any candidate in particular and I have another year
left on my term, but I wanted to make sure that all of you were informed
about the process and took the opportunity to get involved in selecting
those who will influence the future of our organization.  Please let me
know if you have any questions.

Take care!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
OWASP Foundation Board Member
