All:

If you are planning on attending the Texas Regional Infrastructure Security Conference (TRISC) <http://www.trisc.org/> this year, we have it set up so that OWASP members get a $100 discount on their registration.  Seeing as how OWASP individual membership is only $50 this is a pretty good deal!

More information about OWASP Membership can be found here: <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership>

When you go to register for TRISC indicate that you are an OWASP member and include your OWASP membership number.  If you have only recently become a member put "NUMBER PENDING" in the member number field and I will work with the TRISC folks and Kate Hartmann to make sure you are actually a member.

This is going to be a great conference - hope to see folks there.

Thanks,

Dan

Message-ID: <4122F6F18CC18A4FBE1DCBA11348F0AB031A2A05@satmail.denimgroup.com>

Greetings, 

 

If you're receiving this message, it means you are, in fact, part of the
Dallas OWASP mailing list and we need your input!  We had over 60
attendees to the first OWASP meeting in years, and surprisingly, not a
single hand was raised when we asked who had attended a Dallas OWASP
meeting in the past.  Admittedly, I'm excited about the level of
interest in the group!

 

Now, here's where you come in.  To ensure that this group provides
maximum benefit to those who are involved, we're asking for your
feedback.  Please fill out the short survey using the link below.  The
more feedback everyone provides, the more relevant the meetings will be
to you.

 

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wVsjuw09LKCm7kSjyMF0Ew_3d_3d 

 

The survey will be up for a week, so please take a moment to fill it out
today.

 

 

Have a great day!

 

Andrea

All:

The good news: Folks seem to be excited about using their Membership in OWASP to get a $100 discount on the TRISC conference.  Hooray!

The bad news: I screwed up!  Boo!

They have some validation on the TRISC registration website that isn't accepting OWASP membership numbers.  D'Oh!  To register as an OWASP attendee, please use the number 55555001 for registration.  I'll manually go and verify folks' membership offline so kindly don't cheat.  (Obviously please don't share this number.)

A $50 OWASP Individual Membership gets you a $100 discount on TRISC.  You can't beat the math.

The TRISC website is here: <http://www.trisc.org/>

The OWASP Membership website is here: <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership>

Thanks,

Dan

Subject: [Owasp-dallas] TRISC and OWASP - Virtual application security track
Message-ID: <4122F6F18CC18A4FBE1DCBA11348F0AB031A2F8D@satmail.denimgroup.com>

All:

As I have mentioned before, OWASP members get a $100 discount on TRISC 2009 attendance.  Seeing as how OWASP membership now costs $50 that is a great deal.  Bailout!  Just register for TRISC and use the OWASP membership number 55555001 (kindly don't share that number with non-OWASP folks)

There isn't a formal application security track at TRISC this year (yet!), so I thought I would put together a list of the application security-focused talks.  For OWASP San Antonio we will be treating TRISC as our March meeting (regular meetings to resume in April).  For the rest of Texas I hope to see everyone there!

Monday:
1:00: Ballroom A: Rohyt Belani - Phishing 2.0
      Ballroom B: David Lissberger - Hacking Through a Firewall
2:00: Ballroom B: Josh Sokol - Using Proxies to Secure Applications and More
3:15: Ballroom B: Robert Hansen & Rob MacDougal - Assessing Your Web App Manually Without Hacking It

Tuesday:

12:45: Ballroom A: Trey Ford - Top Website Vulnerabilities: Trends, Business Effects, How To Fight Them
       Ballroom B: Mano Paul - Web 0wn3d (OWASP Top 10) In Depth & Demonstrated
1:45: Ballroom B: Matt Tesauro - OWASP Live CD: An Open Environment for Web Application Security
      Amphitheater: John Dickson - The Permanent Campaign: Driving a Secure Software Initiative in the Enterprise
3:15: Ballroom B: Securing SharePoint
