You are invited to the OWASP Dallas Chapter meeting.

Enterprise software security has been a hot topic for over a decade, yet enterprises of all sizes continue to fail at explaining measurable gains, but why? The answer lies in what and how is measured. Success begins with realistic, business-aligned KPIs which can be effectively measured to demonstrate improvement, or lack thereof. Come learn what, and how to effectively measure software security.

When: Wednesday, October 1, 2014 from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM
Where: Richland College (12800 Abrams Road, Dallas, TX 75243) Room: SH117 (Sabine Hall)

Succeeding with Enterprise Software Security Key Performance Indicators


*Short*

Enterprise software security has been a hot topic for over a decade, yet
enterprises of all sizes continue to fail at explaining measurable gains,
but why? The answer lies in what and how is measured. Success begins with
realistic, business-aligned KPIs which can be effectively measured to
demonstrate improvement, or lack thereof. Come learn what, and how to
effectively measure software security.

*Long*
As long as enterprise software has been a target for exploit by attackers,
software security has been on the enterprise CISOs radar. The truth is that
after over a decade of efforts from vendors, open-source communities, and
pundits alike, many organizations are still uncertain whether their
enterprise software security effort is benefitting or hurting their
business. Uncertainty continues to be a problem as threats grow and budget
requests continue to ramp up. Is your organization spending its resources
wisely when it comes to your enterprise software security program? Can you
prove it? More importantly, can you prove it with certainty to someone who
is not a security professional? These are difficult challenges even the
most successful security professionals still face today, as business wants ?
secure? while new-school enterprise security wants to pivot to something
more realistic. Moving from measuring defects, even in business context, to
measuring operational impact on development goals (impact-to-effort),
release schedules (impact-to-release), incident response
(impact-to-response), and impact to operational uptime (impact-to-uptime)
is just a few ways that security can demonstrate improvement and business
impact. This talk shines a spotlight on creating realistic enterprise
software security goals and strategies, and supports the development of
strong governance programs which can effectively define and measure
improvement towards realistic goals. The speaker will cover the changing
goals of enterprise security programs such as design-to-fail principles and
recoverability, all of which require a change in the approach to building
safer software. Most importantly you will learn, from many years of
defining and designing software security programs, realistic examples of
what you should be measuring and how these new school KPIs provide
concrete, evidence-based knowledge into the direction of your software
security efforts. It is time to finally get real and measure it, or quit
wasting time, money and effort.

Subject: [Owasp-dallas] Risk Management Training @ LASCON (10/22)
Message-ID: <CAFwvDeybN0+8pAeawgyTQg16bZcCYJjFL7ZiYMkCn_X_f-tADg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone,

I hope that you all have taken the opportunity to sign up for this year's
Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON).  It features some of the
same high-quality speakers that you would find at conferences like BlackHat
at a fraction of the price.  It is also the biggest fundraiser for the
OWASP Austin chapter and provides the money that we need in order to
sustain things like food and giveaways without charging a fee like other
organizations are now doing.  The talks are up, the bull is back, and we
want to see you there.  Get registered if you haven't already at
http://lascon.org.  Passes are selling quickly so don't risk waiting so
long that they've sold out.

Speaking of risk....(see what I did there)....I will be doing a full-day
risk management training at this year's conference on 10/22.  If you
attended one of the half-days I did in Austin, San Antonio, or Minneapolis,
then this will be similar, but will also walk students through the process
of installing SimpleRisk and all of the finer details of working with the
tool that we didn't get into in the other class.  Instead of using the
hosted version of SimpleRisk, every student will walk away with a
functioning instance in a VM environment and the knowledge to perform the
installation, configuration, and management themselves.  Sure, you could go
out and spent $500k+ on a GRC tool that you'll never full utilize, or you
can spend a mere $249 to spend a day hanging out with me, talking risk
management, learning the ins and outs of SimpleRisk, with meals included.
You can register for my training at LASCON here:

http://lascon.org/training/risk-management-like-a-boss-making-your-risks-work-for-you1-day-training/

LASCON is a fantastic conference, run by great people, and benefiting the
OWASP Foundation.  I hope that you will take the time to register and join
us there next month!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
