I found out that the apple developer program was hacked.  I am an apple
developer and application security engineer and chapter lead at OWASP
Dallas.  I look forward to a healthy conversation about this.  Check out my
blog post.

Thanks,
Matt

I read your post Matt,
I'm sorry to see you upset about this, but your conclusion is not right. These days, hackers are a big step ahead of security experts. I've been both for 10 years now, and I've seen APTs target biggies and take them down eventually. 
You should know that Ubuntu forums was also hacked and 1.8 million user informations were leaked.

Unless a generic approach which increases overal security of Internet and applications is made, life is going to be like this. This last yaer, many countries increased penalties for cybercrimes by a huge factor, implying that cyber attacks are on a rapid rise, and are getting very dangerous and effective. 

Finding security bugs just turned from a Wall of Fame hobby to a serious cash maker, and there are cartels created around it now. You're living in US, and it seems nice and safe, but I've seen the real deal (don't tell that to anyone though).

Sorry again to see you disturbed,
-Abbas

Hi Matt

I know that awful feeling and I can just imagine how your are feeling.

Major companies are getting hacked and It's not only because they do not have the right security experts,
The cyber Mafia is getting better organized and are working harder to find zero vulnerabilities and exploit existing ones.

Also, from my experience, the security engineer is been ignored or there is a false sense of security that CEOs
of major companies have, and a lot of times they don't want to spend budget patching and securing.

A while ago , on the hacker news website, a writer mentioned that major companies such as Google 
are not doing much with a reported bugs...until a hacker exploits the situation. There was a nice article in Wired magazine about one writer getting hacked from his apple account and everything was deleted...gone because he says, a system secured without using two factor authentication is already a big risk.

Many companies do not take serious the threats and this can be frustrating for security engineers trying to do their job.
In my country , this situation is ridiculous, but yes, they think hackers do not attack companies from small countries...let's see how long will the party last.

So we keep on alerting,but indeed sometimes I feel like Noe and the arc....

I think the problem is not only with security experts but CEOs need to become more conscious about the situation. They need to allocate better budgets and Plans to avoid been hacked.

regards

Johanna
