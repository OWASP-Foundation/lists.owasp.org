Thanks Denis!  Also, I'd like to mention that Qualys is sponsoring the
happy hour.

This means you might snag a nice beer glass in addition to a free drink or
two.

Many thanks to all that showed up to happy hour tonight.  Thank you to Denis Sheridan for all his hard work and David Ferguson of Qualys for sponsoring the event.  A good time was had by all.  Our next meeting will be in mid January and David Ferguson will be speaking.  We are still looking for more speakers and places to have our meetings.  Many thanks to Steve Hortsman and Goldman Sachs for hosting and sponsoring pizza.  Many thanks again to Denis Sheridan for doing a lot of background work and Cigital for sponsoring pizza.  Thank you to all of our speakers for 2016, we have had some great ones this year. Finally thank you to all that participate and make OWASP Dallas what it is.
