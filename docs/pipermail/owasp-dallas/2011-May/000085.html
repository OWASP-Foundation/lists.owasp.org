<PRE>FYI,

Our new location sponsor, Richland College is hosting a digital forensics and security summer camp for high school students.  

They are looking for individual speakers, as well as corporate sponsors.

I think this is a very worthwhile cause, and a great way for the OWASP Dallas Chapter to give back to the community 
by shaping the minds of the next generation of security professionals.  

If you're interested in being a speaker, volunteer, or sponsor, please contact myself or Zoltan Szabo (email address listed below).

Thanks,
Ryan W Smith

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Digital Forensics Summer Camp at Richland College
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To all,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> We are having a Summer Camp for student ages 14-16 in June.  This camp is sponsored by the Texas Workforce Commission and will be free of charge to interested students.  We are looking for speakers for any of the following days, June 20 - June 28 during lunch 1:00 - 2:00pm.  If you are available and would like to talk to High Schools students, please let me know.  Your talk should cover career opportunities and skills required to enter Data Security, Information Assurance, Digital Forensics, eDiscovery, or other related fields to help students decide what to study after HS. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> We are also looking for sponsors.  We would like to have sponsors for the daily lunches, prices for competitions ( books, hardware, software, your company's promotional items, ... ), T-Shirt design sponsor.  Any involvement from you would be appreciated.  Just pick a single day or more you'd like to sponsor and let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I would also like to take a group of 10 students on a field trip to visit your site.  They would enjoy the exposure to real working environment.  I'd like to plan the field trip on Friday, June 24, possibly around 10 a.m. for about an hour.  If there are more of you offering us to visit you, I can schedule the visits on the same day since I will be driving the students.  We'll have the bus all day, so we can schedule the visits in different locations.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> We'll also have a second Summer Camp July 13 - July 26 if the June schedule does not work out for you.
