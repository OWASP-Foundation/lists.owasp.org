Fellow OWASPers,
Hopefully by now you've heard the buzz around last year's Lonestar
Application Security Conference (LASCON).  The conference was hosted by the
Austin OWASP Chapter and featured some of the world's top security
researchers including Robert "RSnake" Hansen, Samy Kamkar, Joe Jarzombek,
and many more.  In it's first year, LASCON had over 160 attendees and the
feedback was outstanding.  Here's just a few of examples of what 2010 LASCON
attendees had to say about the conference:

 *With the lineup of presenters that you have for the LASCON Conference, I
can't afford not to go. *
*
- Ian Robertson *

*Just wanted to drop the LASCON organizers a note about how much I enjoyed
the conference last Friday. Good venue, good food, good presentations, and
good people.
- Joel Burrow *

*Thanks for understanding how us geeks think and putting on a conference
that we can really enjoy being a part of.
- Jay Paz *

With so much positive feedback coming out of LASCON 2010 it was a no brainer
for our team to do it again this year.  We've already received commitments
from Jeremiah Grossman, John Steven, Michael Howard, and many more.
Needless to say, this year's conference is gonna rock and we want you to be
a part of it!  We've got special Early-Bird Pricing good through the end of
July.  For the next two weeks *OWASP members can attend LASCON for only
$75.  Non-members can attend LASCON for $125* and that includes a $50 OWASP
membership of which 40% goes to support your local chapter.  You may have
missed out on last year's conference, but you won't want to miss what we
have in store for *LASCON 2011 happening October 28, 2011 at the Norris
Conference Center in Austin, TX*.  And be sure to plan on sticking around
for the LASCON Happy Hour sponsored by Trustwave.  The mechanical bull is
back!  We'll see you at LASCON!

Register for LASCON today at http://www.regonline.com/lascon2011

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol & James Wickett

Message-ID: <CAFwvDexJ+RjsHzr=WrOugDcvtVZ3UsU7_QQy66qd62L_s-2XJg@mail.gmail.com>

OWASPers,

I just wanted to remind you all that the Lonestar Application Security
Conference (LASCON) Early-Bird registration rate ends on Sunday.  Currently
you can register to attend LASCON for only $75 as an OWASP member or $125
for a non-member which includes a year membership ($50 value).  However, as
of Monday, August 1st, the price goes up by $50.  If you're planning on
attending LASCON, now is the time to register before the price goes up.

LASCON is going down on October 28, 2011 at the Norris Conference Center in
Austin, TX.  This year we will have four to five tracks with topics
including Audit, Architecture, Development, and Executive Management.
That's right, bring your boss to LASCON!  The CFP for LASCON is still open
(submissions welcome), but speakers include Jeremiah Grossman, John Steven,
Rafal Los, Michael Howard, Joe Jarzombek, and many more.  We have a happy
hour event immediately after the conference sponsored by Trustwave and the
mechanical bull will be back.  We're looking forward to seeing you at
LASCON!
