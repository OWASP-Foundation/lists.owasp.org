Hi all

We've had a bunch of folks volunteer to speak at our upcoming meetings,
which has been awesome.  Currently, we are booked out until January 2017.
These folks are all local DFW app sec professionals, so I hope others that
have been on the fence about speaking take this as encouragement to give it
a try too!

Upcoming meetings:

   - September 19 - Web Attacker's Toolkit: An in-depth analysis of RFI in
   the wild
   - October 17 - NoSQL: "No Injections" or "No Security"?
   - November 8 - Privacy Preserving Big Data Analytics

* Please note that we've deviated from the regular "3rd Tuesday of the
month" schedule for the remaining 2016 meetings.

Anyone from the chapter planning on going to LASCON in November?

Denis

I am going to be running a 2 day Threat Modeling class in the training slot before LASCON time if anyone is interested.  Not free, but it should be worthwhile and interesting.
