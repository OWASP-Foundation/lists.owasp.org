I've had a few folks reach out to our group regarding free

Subject: [Owasp-dallas] App Sec Internships?
Message-ID: <CADAaQBbG4vJcTuCNeGsx5b8LC-dw3vXzUv_S7TPOoksnEXQHOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Are any companies offering fall internships?  I know a couple of folks
looking for full-time or part-time internships (or contract positions) from
August to December.

We have 1 success story so far of a local OWASP member finding an
internship through this community so I wanted to reach out to see if we can
make that number grow.

Also, we announced the August meeting... a happy hour at Braindead Brewing
in Deep Ellum on August 16th.  Please RSVP here:

Thanks!
Denis
