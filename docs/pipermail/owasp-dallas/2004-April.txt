Hey Dallas OWASP,

Don't forget to register for our special CrossTalk  event (Sponsored by Imperva) on Wednesday at:
http://crosstalk.eventbrite.com/

Basic Details:

Time:
Wednesday, August 24, 2011 
4:45 PM to 8:00 PM (CT)

Location:
CoHabitat 
2517 Thomas Avenue 
Dallas, TX 75201

Quick Description:
This is a unique event co-organized by OWASP Dallas and CoHabitat, with the intention to provide an opportunity for members of the AppSec community to get to know members of the cutting edge web and mobile development community.
As many of you may know, security professionals tend not to specialize or in some cases even be aware of new technologies.  On the flip side, early adopters of new technologies are often not cognizent of the additional security risks that those technologies pose.  This CrossTalk event is an attempt to bridge that gap and provide tech transfer in a social setting between application security experts and developers using cutting edge technologies.  
There will be an open happy hour, followed by short talks from both members of OWASP Dallas and CoHabitat, followed by some time for unstructured collaboration between the two groups.
-Ryan
