Subject: [Owasp-dallas] Apache2 vs. Tomcat for WebGoat
Message-ID: <a46fcc3e0711231256y72a86e48ha379ea7c3a9cf2d6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to get WebGoat to run on my desktop, but already have WAMP5 (with
Apache2) installed on the same machine.  I've moved WebGoat into my
*www*directory and tried running it, but to no avail.  Is there any
way to run
Tomcat and Apache2 side-by-side?  I have a laptop with no server software
installed; should I put Tomcat and WebGoat on there instead?

In ALL things, strive for ><>,
Chris
