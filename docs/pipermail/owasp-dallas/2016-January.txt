Hi all

Thanks to everyone that made it out to our first meeting of the year a few
weeks ago.  It was an interesting talk to kickoff things off and it was
great seeing everyone again.

We just posted the notification for our February meeting.  It will be 5:30
PM on Wednesday, February 17th at the Goldman Sachs office in Irving, TX.
Our topic this month will be "DNS Attack Vectors" and will be presented by
John Devasia from Akamai.  Food and drinks will be provided by Cigital.

Please RSVP here: http://meetu.ps/2TfHr9

PLEASE NOTE: the Goldman Sachs office is a *gun-free zone*.  Please do not
attempt to bring in your guns, holsters, ammo, throwing stars, etc.  Also,
you cannot bring in any bags larger than a small purse.

Let's cross our fingers that an unarmed OWASP Dallas chapter is still a
polite chapter.  ;)

Thanks!
Denis
