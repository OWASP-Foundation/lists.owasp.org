<PRE>*September OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting*


*When*: September 25th, 11:30am-1:00pm

11:45 AM - Chapter Announcements
12:00 PM - Presentation

*Topic:* Vulnerability Spidey Sense

A dedicated attacker does not have time limitations when attempting to find
vulnerabilities in a target. As a penetration tester, you are bound by
certain restrictions, including scope, attack methods, and time/date
restrictions. Because of these restrictions, it's helpful to prioritize
certain targets over others to increase your chances of breaking in. This
talk will cover scenarios which raise red flags for us, why, and how to
develop your own sense of intuition.
*
**Speakers: *Daniel Crowely and Chris Vinecombe

evensuggesting it. Daniel has developed configurable testbeds such as SQLol
