Message-ID: <A94734BB443B4CD5A720DDAA9F96BD2A@Highlands>

Have I missed any activities?  This list has not had any activity in some time.  Is anyone actively working the Dallas chapter?  Do we need someone to do so?

BTW, I am the event coordinator for the Dallas ISSA chapter, so we could do a joint event very easily if desired.  :)

Brad - we had some activities this year but I'm not sure where this is right now.

Hi Brad, 

 

I helped coordinate the last meeting we had here in Westlake, which was
back in September.  I have not seen anything since then.  A joint event
sounds like a great idea!  I would be happy to work with you- please
find my email below.  

 

Thanks!

-Lisa
