Ryan,
I was thinking about using this type of information to do a quantitative
risk assessment to predict future software security vulnerabilities.  I
work for Intel as an application security engineer doing web penetration
testing and source code review.  I am also a second year doctoral student
with an anticipated graduation date of March 2017.  My research topic is a
qualitative review interviewing 20 software security professionals on
secure design patterns.  Dr. Gary McGraw suggested this topic.  Has the
quantitative research been done?  And if not do you think there would be an
interest with working on this?

All the best,
Matt
