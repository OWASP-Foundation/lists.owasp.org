Hi all

We've had a great first quarter of topics and speakers, but we'd like to
take a moment to focus on the folks that make up this chapter.  Please come
out and join your fellow DFW OWASPers for a happy hour at Humperdinks.
We'll be covering appetizers and drinks until 7:00 PM or we run out of
money, whichever comes first. :)

Please RSVP here:

Thanks!
