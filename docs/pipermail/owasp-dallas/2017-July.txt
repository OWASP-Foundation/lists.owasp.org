Subject: [Owasp-dallas] July update
Message-ID: <CADAaQBZfvzPESjULTLKg=SrYsKe_y2gurGomXDtyNLgZUst-dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Just a quick update:

   - The meeting this month will be at Goldman Sachs office in Irving on
   July 19th.  The talk is "IoT Security Landscape: Survey & Analysis"
   presented by Mark Szewczul.  I will be out of town for this one, so  Stark
   Riedesel will be stepping in for me to make sure everything goes smoothly.
   RSVP here:
   https://www.meetup.com/Dallas-The-Open-Web-Application-Security-Project-Meetup/events/240488143/


   - Goldman Sachs has posted their App Sec opening online.  You can check
   it out here:  http://www.goldmansachs.com/a/data/jobs/50632.html


   - I'm working on the remaining schedule for meetings for the year.  I
   should be updating the Meetup site with the details in the next few weeks.
   As always, if you'd like to talk, host, or sponsor, then please let me know
   :)


   - If you have any announcements you'd like to share with the group, I'm
   happy to help with that too.

Thanks!
Denis
