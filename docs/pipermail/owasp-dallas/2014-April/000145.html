Dates and deadlines

April 27th, 2014: Submission deadline
May 30th, 2014: Notification of acceptance
August 4th, 2014: Final materials due for review
September 18th &#8211; 19th, 2014: Conference proceedings
Topics of interest

Conference sessions will be divided into four primary tracks and two
smaller supporting tracks. Consistent with OWASP, each track will relate in
part to web application security. The primary tracks are:

Builders
Targeting developers, testers, and managers involved in the secure software
development lifecycle.
Breakers
Focusing on matters relevant to penetration testers, researchers, and other
security professionals.
Defenders
Emphasizing operations issues affecting infrastructure security teams,
administrators, support, etc.
Policy and Legal
Addressing privacy, compliance, and legal issues affecting development and
security communities.
The secondary tracks are:

OWASP-specific
Status, recruiting, and awareness for OWASP projects; board panels;
leadership workshops; etc.
Hands-On Skills Lab
Introductory workshops designed to familiarize attendees with critical
tools (e.g., &#8220;nmap 101&#8243;).
We invite all practitioners of application security and those who work or
interact with all facets of application security to submit presentations
including, but not limited to the following subject areas:

Secure development: secure coding, static analysis, application threat
modelling, web frameworks security, countermeasures, SDLC, DevOps, etc.
Mobile security: Development and/or testing devices and the mobile web
Cloud security: Offensive and defensive considerations for cloud-based web
applications
Infrastructure security: Database security, VoIP, hardware, identity
management
Penetration testing: Methodologies, tools, exploit development, evasion
techniques, OSINT, etc.
Emerging web technologies and associated security considerations
Incident response: Threat detection, triage, malware analysis, forensics,
rootkit detection
OWASP tools and projects in practice
Policy and legal: Legislation, privacy, regulations and compliance, C-level
considerations, etc.
Cool hacks and other fun stuff: cryptography, social engineering, etc.
