</I>&gt;<i> Hi dear fellow chapter and project leaders,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> as you might already know, we finally released it. After receiving your
</I>feedback
&gt;<i> over the last few weeks with more than 90% in favour of that OWASP should
</I>&gt;<i> make a statement and the last reviews here on the list, it finally has
</I>been
&gt;<i> released to the media. Please feel free to share with your chapters,
</I>peers, on
&gt;<i> twitter, linkedin, etc. and with the media in your countries.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP Statement on the Security of the Internet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project, www.owasp.org)
</I>&gt;<i> community cares deeply about how much people can trust commonly used
</I>&gt;<i> Internet services and the applications that provide and use these
</I>services. The
&gt;<i> reports about large-scale intelligence activities targeting Internet
</I>&gt;<i> communication and applications and possible attempts to undermine
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographic algorithms leave us deeply concerned. We knew about the
</I>&gt;<i> interception of targeted individuals and other monitoring activities,
</I>however,
&gt;<i> the scale of recently reported activities and the possibility of active
</I>&gt;<i> undermining of the security of deployed applications are alarming.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it is hard to know for sure from current reports which attack
</I>&gt;<i> techniques may be in use and which secret agreements may be in place. As
</I>&gt;<i> such, it is not so easy to comment on the specifics from an OWASP
</I>perspective.
&gt;<i> OWASP has long-standing general principles that we can talk about, and
</I>&gt;<i> address some of the actions we are taking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our mission is to make application security visible so that people and
</I>&gt;<i> organizations can make informed decisions about application security
</I>risks.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *	We strongly believe trustworthy secure software and applications are
</I>&gt;<i> an important cornerstone of human society and interactions of all people
</I>&gt;<i> around the world.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *	We strongly believe that people, companies and governments must
</I>&gt;<i> protect software security and must not intentionally weaken software
</I>security,
&gt;<i> security standards, or undermine the security of cryptographic algorithms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *	We strongly believe that people, companies and governments must not
</I>&gt;<i> intentionally introduce defects or vulnerabilities (or secret back-doors)
</I>&gt;<i> compromising the security, trust and integrity of software and
</I>applications.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We think it is also important to point out that if vulnerabilities are
</I>introduced
&gt;<i> by people, governments or corporations to enable monitoring, this will not
</I>only
&gt;<i> have adverse effects on freedom and trust within human society, but sooner
</I>or
&gt;<i> later these vulnerabilities and weaknesses will also be found and
</I>exploited by
&gt;<i> malicious actors and criminals. Furthermore, the general population and
</I>&gt;<i> companies will then be left without protection against these actors,
</I>&gt;<i> undermining the very foundations of many software applications that
</I>support
&gt;<i> our daily lives, and with potentially world-wide catastrophic
</I>consequences.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OWASP community wants to help build secure and deployable systems for
</I>&gt;<i> all Internet users. Addressing security and new vulnerabilities has been
</I>the key
&gt;<i> strength of the OWASP community for more than a decade and technology
</I>&gt;<i> alone is not the only factor. Education, operational practices, laws, and
</I>other
&gt;<i> similar factors also matter. We see the recent news and developments as a
</I>&gt;<i> challenge, inspiring us to stand by our principles and work harder and do
</I>more
&gt;<i> to make the web and applications more secure. Eoin Keary, OWASP board
</I>&gt;<i> member, pointed out: &quot;OWASP cannot stand by and let the erosion of
</I>security
&gt;<i> occur; it is against our mission.&quot; We are confident that the OWASP
</I>community
&gt;<i> can do its part and we believe that OWASP security recommendations and
</I>&gt;<i> tools, if used more widely, can help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We should seize this opportunity to take a look at what we can do better
</I>going
&gt;<i> forward; not only think about all this just in light of the recent
</I>revelations. The
&gt;<i> security and privacy of the Internet in general is still a major
</I>challenge, even
&gt;<i> ignoring recent intelligence activities. Lessons can be drawn from the
</I>above
&gt;<i> that will be generally useful in many ways for years to come. And Tobias
</I>&gt;<i> Gondrom, OWASP board member, voiced the hope, that &#147;perhaps this year&#146;s
</I>&gt;<i> discussions can be the inspiring spark to motivate the world to become
</I>more
&gt;<i> security aware, address open issues and move from &#147;insecure by default&#148; to
</I>&gt;<i> &#147;secure by default&#148;.&#148;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Publicity and motivation are important, too. There is plenty to do for all
</I>of us,
&gt;<i> from users enabling additional security features to security experts,
</I>companies
&gt;<i> and governments ensuring that their users, products, services and
</I>applications
&gt;<i> are secure. OWASP is an open community and we invite everyone interested
</I>in
&gt;<i> working on this area to rise to this challenge and contribute to the
</I>analysis and
&gt;<i> develop ideas in this area together for our common future.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All the best and thanks a lot for your initiative and all the great work,
</I>Tobias
