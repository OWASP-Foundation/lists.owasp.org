Countdown Challenges -- Win Free Tickets to AppSec EU Research 2013 in Hamburg!


The OWASP German Chapter will host the OWASP AppSec Europe Research 2013 global conference in Hamburg, Germany from August 20-23. The event will be composed of 2 days of training (August 20-21), followed by 2 days of conference talks (August 22-23). The conference is expected to draw 400-500 technologists from Research, Government, Financial Services, Media, Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare, Technology and many other verticals.

Visit the conference page  <A HREF="https://appsec.eu/">https://appsec.eu/</A>  for details.

There will be a challenge posted on the conference wiki page every month up until the event in August. The winner of each challenge will get free entrance to the conference, worth about &#8364;420. Be sure to sign up for the conference mailing list  <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013</A>  to get a monthly reminder.


The first challenge with OWASP AppSec EU Research is history! The first challenge is now closed. But wait, we have opened the second challenge as part of this series today. 


The 5'th challenge starts here
=================================

    <A HREF="https://www.hacking-lab.com/events/registerform.html?eventid=453&amp;uk=uS8wgSSVrxNJJSBFhzLet2jhBjEGFdpv">https://www.hacking-lab.com/events/registerform.html?eventid=453&amp;uk=uS8wgSSVrxNJJSBFhzLet2jhBjEGFdpv</A>

How to Win
=================================

Each challenge will be announced on the conference wiki page and the conference mailing list

	<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013</A>

Simply follow the link, login, and follow the instructions for the challenge. Provide your solution, which then will be marked. The challenge will be opened right after the announcement and will be closed 4 weeks later. The winner will be rewarded a free conference ticket 3 days later.

The organizing committee will review the provided solutions and accept or reject it. While the challenge is open, rejected solutions can be enhanced and submitted again. If there are equal solutions at the end of the challenge, the first submitted one wins.

At end of the last challenge, right before the conference starts, additional tickets will be given to the best provided solutions over all submitted solutions. 

The free ticket is personal and the judgement of the organizing committee can not be overruled.
