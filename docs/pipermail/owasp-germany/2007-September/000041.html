<PRE>Hello Harsh, 

 

the names of the chapter lead and board members have been published
today on the German chapter page. 

But maybe it's easier if you just give me a quick call. 

 

Tobias

Hello Tobias,

 

Thanks for such a warm welcome! It is indeed very nice to read your
email. 

I would welcome just a meeting with people and not necessarily to be
focused in Mobile.

 

Yes, I would like to have some of the potential contact points as you
mentioned for the German chapter and would like to request you for same.
Unfortunately, I do not have your phone number.

Can you please email me your number and we can talk.

 

Kind Regards,

Harsh Verma

Hello Harsh, 

 

wishing you a warm welcome in Germany and Munich. 

(It seems that after several weeks of rain, we finally got the weather
right for all the guests coming in the next four weeks to Munich.)

Unfortunately I am not so deep into Mobile Environments and Streaming,
and this week already fully booked. 

 

As the chapter is at the moment still in the &quot;reboot&quot; phase, it might be
that we do not have many members in this specific area - yet. 

However, I hope you have a nice stay in Munich and if you have any
questions regarding potential contact points of the German chapter feel
free to give me a quick call. 

 

Kind regards, Tobias

Hello,

 

I plan to be in Munich from Sept 17 to 21 and would like to meet up with
anyone interested for a chat on Security in Mobile Environments and
Streaming Media.

 

Looking forward to this interaction and exciting collaboration.

 

Kind Regards,

Harsh
