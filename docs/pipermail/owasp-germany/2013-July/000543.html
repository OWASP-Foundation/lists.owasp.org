Countdown Challenges -- Win Free Tickets to AppSec EU Research 2013 in Hamburg!


The OWASP German Chapter will host the OWASP AppSec Europe Research 2013 global conference in Hamburg, Germany from August 20-23. The event will be composed of 2 days of training (August 20-21), followed by 2 days of conference talks (August 22-23). The conference is expected to draw 400-500 technologists from Research, Government, Financial Services, Media, Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare, Technology and many other verticals.

Visit the conference page  <A HREF="https://appsec.eu/">https://appsec.eu/</A>  for details.

There will be a challenge posted on the conference wiki page every month up until the event in August. The winner of each challenge will get free entrance to the conference, worth about &#8364;420. Be sure to sign up for the conference mailing list  <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/appseceu2013</A>  to get a monthly reminder.
