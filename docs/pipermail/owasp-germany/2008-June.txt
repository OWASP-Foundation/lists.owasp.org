Last week I started the OWASP Open Review Project (ORPRO). Goal is to
perform independent security review of commonly used open source
software.

I am in the middle of setting up the project, and looking at the
following aspects:
1. Code review collaboration platform (requirements, hosting, costs, etc)
2. Which open source projects to review (common libraries, OWASP
projects, apps most popular with OWASP, etc)
3. Work instructions for reviewers (use of OWASP and other resources,
tools, etc.)
4. Rules for disclosure (attributed to reviewer, no commercial gain,
use of oCERT, etc)

Project page:

Mailing list:
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/open-review-project

Any help is appreciated!
