Subject: [Owasp-germany] CSRF guard 3.0.0 implementation Successfull with Tomcat but failing with Websphere Application Server 7.0.0.39

Hello OWASP Germany team members,

Greetings.
I am currently facing an issue with CSRF guard 3.0.0 implementation on Websphere Application Server 7.0.0.39.
I have already contacted OWASP site and was able to get a response from Azzedine Ramrami.
The details of the problem are in the mail attached.
The problem is still unsolved.
Currently I am working in Munich, Germany.
I have websphere setup on my system.
I was just hoping if I can get some help to resolve my issue.
I would be very thankful if anyone can give me any pointers related to this based on past experience.


Thanks and Regards,

Hi Azzeddine 

Thank you for your time and quick responses.

I will try to connect you with some one in a US company who implemented CSFRGuard with Websphere.
For this project we have only one Mailing List. I don't knew OWASP Germany mail list ?
For support I don't deliver any support because we don't have a time and we don't have the budget to do it.
A lot of company are using CSRFGuard in there products without supporting the project.  So If you don't get reply immediately don't complain you will get an answer from community on best effort basis and volunteer availability.
Reagrds,

Hi,
 
Greetings for the day.
First of all thanks so much for the reply.
I will use the latest version of CSRFGuard and try once.
 
I found mails on OWASP site about CSRFGuard implementation with Websphere tried before as well.
But I don't know whether it was implemented successfully or not.
Example :
<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-csrfguard/2014-April/000300.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-csrfguard/2014-April/000300.html</A>
It will be good if someone from some other company has implemented it earlier.
 
As I am currently working in Munich,Germany can you please cc  OWASP Germany mail list ?
I already tried subscribing to their list but it failed.
It will help me contact them and meet them as I have websphere setup on my laptop so that they can at least analyse the problem.
 
By the time if I get any success, I'll definitely share it with you guys.
 
Thanks again.
Have a nice day.
Regards,
Jagmeet Singh Granthi

Just please use the last version of CSFRGuard is it 3.1.0.
You can download it from OWASP CSFRGuard website or from Maven Central.

Hi,
As CSFRGuard Project leader it will be difficult to deliver any support about WebSphere CSRFGuard implementation for several reasons:
- We have no support service. All support is done by community via Github.
- We don't have a WS license to setup a PoC 
- We don't have a budget and resources to do that

Sorry for that.
I will some one from a complany that already implemented CSFRGuard with WebSphere if they can help and give advice.

Hey Claudia,
 
Thanks for forwarding my issue to Azzedine.
I had mailed the whole team earlier but didn't get any response from them.
May be I didn't approached them the correct way.
Hope at least someone has faced this issue earlier so that I can get some pointers to resolve this.
Thanks a lot again for your help.

Hello Team,
 
While browisng on OWASP forum, i found that the project leader had previously worked on this issue :-
 
<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-csrfguard/2014-April/000300.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-csrfguard/2014-April/000300.html</A>
 
 
Can anyone please ask him to reply to my mail at least.
I don't think he has even seen this.
I am trying hard but I cannot get a solution to this.
 
Still stuck with no JCEProvider issue :-
 
SEVERE: Exception sending context initialized event to listener instance of class org.owasp.csrfguard.CsrfGuardServletContextListener
java.lang.RuntimeException: java.security.NoSuchProviderException: no such provider: IBMJCE

Subject: CSRF guard 3.0.0 implementation Successfull with Tomcat but failing with Websphere Application Server 7.0.0.39
 
Hello CSRFGuard team members,
 
Greetings for the day.
I am currently working with CSRFGuard as a security implementation for one of the applications.
When I installed CSRFGuard 3.0.0 using Tomcat as a server it worked perfectly fine.
However when I tried using Websphere Application Server 7.0.0.39, it initially threw a null pointer exception  (Attached file NullPointerSessionIssue)
Later I searched on the internet if anyone faced such issue earlier, I found that the following properties were required while using Websphere :-
 
From: org.owasp.csrfguard.PRNG=SHA1PRNG
&gt;<i> To: org.owasp.csrfguard.PRNG=IBMSecureRandom
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> From: org.owasp.csrfguard.PRNG.Provider=SUN
</I>&gt;<i> To: org.owasp.csrfguard.PRNG.Provider=IBMJCE
</I> 
Configured these and tried again. But I never changed any content of csrfguard-3.0.0.jar.
But it threw a run time exception again.(Attached file JCEProviderIssue).
 
I have already spent some time trying to get the correct configuration. It would be very kind of you if you can help me out here.
Please let me know the complete configuration required in CSRF properties file,csrfguard.js and /or also on Websphere server (if any).
If you have a document or any work around related to this issue, it would prove very helpful.
 
P.S :-
I have already referred many links on internet two of them are mentioned below:-
