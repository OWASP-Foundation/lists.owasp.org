Hello Leaders,

The Nepal chapter lead Gaurab Raj Pant has contacted me today, and told me their situation.

================================
As I&#8217;m sure you already know, a devastating 7.6 Richter scale earthquake hit Nepal on the 25th April 2015, at 11: 58 AM, destroying many historical landmarks, houses, roads and killing approx. 3725 people in 48 of 75 districts in Nepal while the death toll still continues to rise.

Continued tremors are still being felt, meaning everyone is out on the open area where ever they can find. Should tremors continue (which has stopped for the last few hours) and if people are out like this, we are likely to see huge challenge of basic supplies like water and also major public health disaster. If tremors stop and people can go to their homes and their life, Kathmandu, for the most part, should be fine. Outside Kathmandu, the situation is severe. Thousands are now homeless, have lost all supplies to the quakes, students have passed away, and community members continue to cry out for help but to no avail. From what we have seen in our attempt to provide relief, there has been no effort from the government or other agencies in rural Nepal.

Please help Nepalese.
================================

And he and his family are safe so far, but living at tents in open space.
People need Medical, Tents, Cloths, water purifier continuously, though  Red Cross has fed these. As for chapter members, some could be  connected safe but still some are not still connected, Gaurab said.

I do not have enough information to help them but I strongly encourage all of you chapter leads to find how to help Nepal's people and society from various ways.

Thanks,

Rio
