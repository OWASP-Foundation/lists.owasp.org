<PRE>Dear All,

I would like to thank everyone, for participating in the OWASP maling list. I am sure that this is the right step to achieve considerable results for our chapter.

As we are still in the creation phase of the chapter, there are some points, which i would like to share with you and especially to receive you feedback in order to organize the Kick-off meeting:

First of all, it is important to define the expectations from the activities of the chapter. We intend to consider as many wishes as possible, which we could treat. Only if the scope of our activities is defined according to the wishes of the members and their skills (within the scope of the OWASP project), engagement could be expected.   

I would like to ask, everyone of you to give me and the other members his opinion about our possiblle activities, which results should we achieve (guidelines, tools, methodolgies, standards, etc...) and probably the areas in which everyone could participate (programming, design, etc..).

The results of our apriori discussion will determine the topics, which we will consider in the kick-off Meeting.

Any points of discussion are highly appreciated.


Thanks in advance &amp; Best Regards.
