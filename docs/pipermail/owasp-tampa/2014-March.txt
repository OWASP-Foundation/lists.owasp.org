Good Evening,

Our next meeting will be held on Wednesday, March 12 from 6 PM to 8 PM

entitled The Enemy Within. Information on both presenters and their

The following is an agenda for our next meeting:

6:00 PM to 7:00 PM - Presentation
7:00 PM to 7:15 PM - Break
7:15 PM to 8:00 PM - Presentation

Herding Cats - Carl Brothers, F5 Networks - Ensuring that we can
provide security and availability for on premise apps and cloud based
apps, that are increasingly being accessed from uncontrolled devices
feels like a never ending struggle to keep the cats in the corral.
Let's discuss the tools and approaches we can use to ensure that
security <> decreased performance, revenue or customer satisfaction.

Engineer after many years of being an F5 customer. Carl's previous

The Enemy Within - Ramece Cave, Solutionary - Web Server Intel
Correlation (might change the name). The presentation will discuss how
and why web servers play a role in intelligence gathering and threat
correlation. It will go over previous hacking campaigns and how data
was leveraged for exploitation or exfiltration, and how compromised
servers are being used.
