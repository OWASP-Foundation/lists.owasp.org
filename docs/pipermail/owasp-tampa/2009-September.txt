Subject: [Owasp-tampa] 2009-Q3 Meeting Update
Message-ID: <4c4fe6bf0909011945w5518789kfcfa09ec8c464e79@mail.gmail.com>

An update for next week's meeting: Wes Brown of IOActive had to cancel due
to a conflict. Tony Flick of FYRM Associates will fill in and present his
Black Hat USA 2009 and DEFCON 17 "Hacking the Smart Grid" presentation.

*"The city of Miami and several commercial partners plan to rollout a "smart
grid" citywide electrical infrastructure by the year 2011. This rollout
proceeds on the heels of news that foreign agents have infiltrated our
existing electrical infrastructure and that recent penetration tests have
uncovered numerous vulnerabilities in the proposed technologies.
Simultaneously, the National Institute for Standards in Technology (NIST)
has recently released a roadmap for producing Smart Grid standards. In this
presentation, Tony will discuss the flaws with the current guidelines and
map them to the criticisms of similar regulatory mandates, including the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), that rely heavily on
organizations policing themselves.**"*

A reminder that our next quarterly meeting will be held next Wednesday,
September 9 from 6PM to 8PM at the Kforce building in Ybor.

security list.

A reminder that CISSPs can earn 1 CPE credit for every hour of attendance at
OWASP meetings.

Thanks and see you there,
