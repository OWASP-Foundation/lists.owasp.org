Hello Everyone,
   Our special event of the year is almost here!  Tickets are sold out and
we are looking forward to seeing everyone!

Our location is Wellcare Health Plans campus on Henderson Road.  If you
haven't been there before, allocate additional time to park and find the
building...it's a big place!  I've placed the parking instructions below
which are also available on your eventbrite ticket.  Also, I am attaching a
picture of the campus which Kim, from Wellcare, provided to help everyone
get familiar with the area.

Registration is from 8:00-8:30a on Friday.  See you then!!!


*Location:* Wellcare Health Plans, Inc. at 8745 Henderson Road. As you turn
right onto the campus from Henderson, follow the access road towards the
left and park in Parking Garage A. From the parking garage, follow the
sidewalk crossings and walk towards the very last building at the end of
the long sidewalk. The 8745 building also houses the cafeteria. Look for
signs to direct your way.
