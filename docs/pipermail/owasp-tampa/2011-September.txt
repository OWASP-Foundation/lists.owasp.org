Thanks to everyone who attended the meeting on Tuesday night. We had two
great talks and a higher than expected turnout rate!

I've posted the presentations to the Chapter Page for those who are
interested. They are available from
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Tampa#Presentation_Archives

If you have any suggestions for presentation topics or would like to present
at our 2011-Q4 meeting (most likely in December) please send me an email.

Thanks!
Justin

Thanks Justin.  I recently moved to Tampa and I'm glad to find the group.  If anybody wants to grab a coffee let me know.
