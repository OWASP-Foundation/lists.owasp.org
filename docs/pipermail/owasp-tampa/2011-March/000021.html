<PRE>Our 2011-Q1 meeting will be on Wednesday, March 16, from 6PM until
8PM. I am trying a new format with three shorter length talks. First
off are Richard Newman and Brett McKinney. They will be speaking on
performing vulnerability testing in an IPv6 world. Our second talk
features Jeff LoSapio, Managing Partner at Stratum Security. Jeff will
be discussing the lessons learned from deploying static analysis in
development groups. Finally, Chris Patten of Packet Research will be
presenting on intelligence gathering for penetration testers.

Abstracts for each of the talks are below:

1. Richard Newman &amp; Brett McKinney - Vulnerability Management in an IPv6 World

With the last of the IPv4 addresses allocated to the regional
registrars, IPv4 is quickly seeing an end to its reign. For a time
we&#8217;ll see dual addressed networks as IPv6 is implemented and deployed.
What does this mean to vulnerability and application scanning,
penetration testing, and more?

2. Jeff LoSapio - Real Lessons of Deploying Static Analysis in
Development Groups

   - Is it really worth investing in static analysis tools for your developers?
   - Can you effectively deploy the tools and attain valuable results?
   - What are the pitfalls?
   - How do you succeed?

3. Chris Patten - Intelligence Gathering for Penetration Testers: Opening
Doors with Metadata

This talk will provide insight into the often-overlooked requirement
of performing effective intelligence gathering as a means to achieve a
successful penetration test. In the age of technology, information is
shared throughout organizations and distributed all over the world.
Learn how penetration testers target hidden metadata and use it to
open virtual doors. Finally, find out what can be done to protect
against metadata harvesting attacks.

Please RSVP to me (<A HREF="http://scr.im/mascasa">http://scr.im/mascasa</A>) by Tuesday, March 15, so
that you can be added to the security list.

A reminder that CISSPs can earn 1 CPE credit for every hour of
attendance at OWASP meetings.

Thanks and see you there,
Justin Morehouse
