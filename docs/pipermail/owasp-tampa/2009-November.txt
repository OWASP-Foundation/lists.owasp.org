Our next quarterly meeting will be held on Wednesday, December 9 from 6PM to
8PM at the Kforce building in Ybor. I will be reviewing the OWASP Top 10
2010 RC1. This presentation will include an overview of the changes, as well
as an open discussion on the RC's strengths and weaknesses.

For more information, visit the Tampa chapter at https://www.owasp

Please RSVP to me by Monday, December 7, so that you can be added to the
security list.

A reminder that CISSPs can earn 1 CPE credit for every hour of attendance at
OWASP meetings.

Thanks and see you there,
Justin
