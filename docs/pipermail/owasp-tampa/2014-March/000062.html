<PRE>Good Evening,

Our next meeting will be held on Wednesday, March 12 from 6 PM to 8 PM
at GuidePoint Security in Downtown Saint Petersburg. We will have two
presentations. The first, from Carl Brothers of F5 Networks is
entitled Herding Cats. The second, from Ramece Cave of Solutionary is
entitled The Enemy Within. Information on both presenters and their
presentations is below.

The following is an agenda for our next meeting:

5:45 PM to 6:00 PM - Check-in
6:00 PM to 7:00 PM - Presentation
7:00 PM to 7:15 PM - Break
7:15 PM to 8:00 PM - Presentation

Herding Cats - Carl Brothers, F5 Networks - Ensuring that we can
provide security and availability for on premise apps and cloud based
apps, that are increasingly being accessed from uncontrolled devices
feels like a never ending struggle to keep the cats in the corral.
Let's discuss the tools and approaches we can use to ensure that
security &lt;&gt; decreased performance, revenue or customer satisfaction.

Carl Brother Biography - Carl Brothers joined F5 as a Field Systems
Engineer after many years of being an F5 customer. Carl's previous
roles have ranged from operations to systems engineering at a top 30
e-tailer and a global manufacturing company. Carl has considerable
experience with web-based and virtualization technologies, including
Citrix, Microsoft and VMware.

The Enemy Within - Ramece Cave, Solutionary - Web Server Intel
Correlation (might change the name). The presentation will discuss how
and why web servers play a role in intelligence gathering and threat
correlation. It will go over previous hacking campaigns and how data
was leveraged for exploitation or exfiltration, and how compromised
servers are being used.

Ramece Cave Biography - Began working in information security in the
Internet Abuse department at UUNET in 1999. Over the past 10 years
have been focusing on forensics, reverse engineering, and malware
analysis; in various incident response and SOC positions. Currently
work as Research Analyst at Solutionary.

See you there!

Justin
