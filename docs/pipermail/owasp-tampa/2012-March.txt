1. Protecting Against SQLi in Real-Time - Stuart Hancock, Director of
Systems Engineering, DBNetworks*

Weekly, there are news reports of new SQL injection attacks on corporate
databases throughout the country. While applications which are free from
vulnerabilities are always the best solution, a better backstop is
clearly needed. Existing solutions are unable to defend against this
threat. DBNetworks will present its vision for a future technology which
will protect against new and unique SQL injection attacks in real-time.

/Prior to coming on board at DBNetworks as the Director of Systems
Engineering, Stuart was the Enterprise Cloud Program Manager at Cisco
Systems; prior to that, he held positions at Cisco as a consulting
engineer and HPC architect, and has worked in the past for a number of
startups as well as EMC, IPivot (acquired by Intel for $500M), Intel,
and Wang Laboratories./

*2. Inside Anonymous: Lessons Learned - Bill Church, Field Systems
Engineer - Federal, F5 Networks*

Lessons learned from F5 customers who have been attacked by Anonymous
and survived. We will walk through attacks complete with logs and
captures showing how the attacks arrived and how were ultimately
thwarted. We will also share tips for tuning your systems during an attack.

/Bill has been in the information security space since 1998 both as
customer, consultant, and an engineer. He was dropped in the deep end of
a dot com website in the early 2000s in the days of Code Red and Nimda
and and had to learn security the hard way. Bill is a firm believer in
"know thy enemy and know thy self", you can't effectively secure
yourself if you don't understand how the bad guys think and operate. He
enjoys long walks on the beach and a fine single malt scotch./
