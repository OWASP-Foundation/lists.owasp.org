= Presentation =

Abstract: This presentation will serve as an introduction for those who
want to dive into the art of reverse engineering Android applications and
firmware. We will explore the inner workings of the Android architecture,
traverse the landscape of reverse engineering tools and techniques, and
propose some practical methodologies and workflows for all your bug hunting
needs.

Bio: Benjamin Watson has over 7 dedicated years in application and mobile
security. Prior to joining GuidePoint Security, Ben has been solving mobile
&amp; application security problems for cutting edge companies in the financial
services, eCommerce, and medical industries. Often Ben has been sought
after for building application security programs from the ground up. This
is due to his experience in not only developing testing methodologies,
tools, and techniques, but his understanding and perspective around what it
requires to build secure products. Ben has managed and lead efforts in
large mobile application security service initiatives, and is also an
experienced mobile security researcher. He currently focuses his efforts
around discovering new exploitable vulnerability patterns in Android and
iOS. He also has multiple published zero day vulnerabilities effecting
various Android web browsers, and is the creator and curator of the Android
assessment toolkit called Lobotomy.
