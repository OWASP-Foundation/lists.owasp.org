<PRE>Hello!

Our next meeting will be held on Wednesday, September 26 from 6 PM to 8 PM.
We will be having two technical talks. For the first talk, Richard Newman
will be presenting 'Taming B.E.A.S.T.' Ken Gehrke will be providing the
second presentation which will be a hands-on workshop covering tools
contained within the latest version of Backtrack. Their bios abstracts are
below:


*Richard Newman - Taming the B.E.A.S.T* Curious about the exploit which
allows for the clear text recovery of encrypted web traffic? Stay tuned. In
this presentation the Browser Exploit Against SSL / TLS will be demystified
and explained.

*Richard is a senior information security engineer with a large local
retailer, has 23 years experience within IT and recently 8 years in
Information Security. He focusses on computer forensics, network security,
vulnerability analysis, network and application penetration testing.*


*Ken Gehrke - Tool Talk - Application Security* The presentation will
include a brief powerpoint of general web application security concepts and
discussion about some common tools within Backtrack 5 R3 and other
application security tools such as BurpSuite and Netsparker. The
presentation will then be driven into a live demonstration of some general
web application penetration testing techniques against DVWA and NOWASP
(Mutillidae) hosted on the Metasploitable 2 VM platform.

-= No wifi or network access will be required as the pen test lab is
contained within VM =-

*Ken Gehrke is a 12 year veteran of information security and has covered a
large spectrum of security operations, audit and penetration testing over
the course of his career. Ken is currently working as a private consultant
and has a background working in big 4, telecommunications and health care
organizations. His specialty is web application security and web
application penetration testing.*
