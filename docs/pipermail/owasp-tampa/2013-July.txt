After way too long, I am happy to announce that OWASP Tampa Day 2013 will
be taking place on Monday, August 19th at Firestick Grill inside the Tampa
Bay Times Forum!

Registration is open as of now, so make sure to reserve your ticket by
visiting: http://owasptampaday2013.eventbrite.com

The Eventbrite site will be updated with presentation abstracts and speaker
information in the coming days, but I wanted to get the date on everyone's
calendar ASAP.

Thanks and I hope to see you there!

Justin
