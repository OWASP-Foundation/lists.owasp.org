Good Afternoon,

I am proud to announce that registration for OWASP Tampa Day 2012 is now
open! The 2nd annual OWASP Tampa Day will take place on Thursday, June 7th
at HealthPlan Services in Tampa. This FREE event will feature presentations
aimed at providing developers and Information Security professionals with
an introduction to application security. However, ALL are welcome to
attend. Attendees will leave the event with a greater understanding of how
and when to integrate application security principles into their daily
processes and procedures. Additionally, attendees will learn how common
attacks are performed and how to mitigate them.

For more information and to register for OWASP Tampa Day, please visit:

Please pass this email on to any folks you think may be interested in
attending the event.

Thanks and see you at OWASP Tampa Day 2012!

Justin

We realize this is a busy time of year, and several of you have contacted us
requesting an extension to put the finishing touches on your submission to
ACSAC 2012.? The deadline for paper, case study, panel, course/training, and
workshop submissions is therefore being extended by 1 week from June 1 to
*June 8*. Hopefully this will provide an opportunity for you to complete
your submission, or to make one if you had not considered it before.? We
expect the June 8 deadline to be firm in order to allow adequate time for
review, so please be sure to make your submission as soon as possible.?
Details on how to make a submission are available at www.acsac.org/cfp/.

In case you know of a colleague doing interesting work in applied computer
security, please encourage them to make a submission as well.

We look forward to your submission,
