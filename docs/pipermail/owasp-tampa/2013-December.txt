Subject: [Owasp-tampa] 2013-Q4 Meeting Cancellation Notice
Message-ID: <CAGuN4Gww-C9NmkFCciYmbECQ38ynAsHU_YiurnKG19vi6Cx1Cw@mail.gmail.com>

Good Morning,

I am canceling the meeting tonight because we only had three RSVPs and no
speaker. I was planning on making tonight a 2014 planning meeting, but we
can do that during our 2014-Q1 meeting.

Happy Holidays and see you in 2014!

Thanks,
Justin
