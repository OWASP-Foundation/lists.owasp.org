<PRE>Our next quarterly meeting will be held on Wednesday, September 9 from 6PM
to 8PM at the Kforce building in Ybor. Wes Brown of IOActive will be
presenting &quot;So You Want To Analyze Malware?&quot;

&quot;*Malware is a broad category of &#8216;malicious&#8217; software that covers trojans,
viruses, worms, rootkits, and other software that steals information or
subverts computers into unintended purposes. There are many reasons why one
would want to analyze malware, and they can range from professional interest
in defending networks from them, to personal fascination in the techniques
involved in crafting them.*

*Whatever one&#8217;s reason for analyzing malware, Wes will share many of the
techniques that he&#8217;s utilized in the course of his career working on client
incident response engagements as well as a full time analyst on a heuristic
detection product.*

*Many might think that the techniques are dominated by methods such as
reverse engineering and binary analysis, and indeed it is a major part of
any analyst&#8217;s toolkit. However, statistical analysis, and static forensics
can often play just as key a role, combined with scripting, systems
management, and data warehousing.*

*Wes will describe and show examples of such techniques, as well as
supporting tools. The emphasis will be on doing this with low cost or free
tools, so that an audience member can get up and running quickly with
malware analysis even on a shoestring budget.&quot;*

Please RSVP to me by Monday, September 7 so that you can be added to the
security list.

A reminder that CISSPs can earn 1 CPE credit for every hour of attendance at
OWASP meetings.

Thanks and see you there,
Justin
