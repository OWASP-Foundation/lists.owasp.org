Subject: [Owasp-tampa] OWASP Tampa Chapter 2010-Q4 Meeting
Message-ID: <AANLkTim-zyGQR8o9VSWTWnktjinqozt4rDi0Nm6dD4Dc@mail.gmail.com>

Our 2010-Q4 meeting will be on Wednesday, December 8, from 6PM until
8PM. Zate Berg (@zate) will be giving an updated version of his
Hack3rcon 2010 Talk, entitled "Nessus Bridge for Metasploit." A
synopsis is below:

"Nessus Bridge for Metasploit: Having hundreds of exploits at your
fingertips is half the battle, but getting information out of Nessus
and into Metasploit where you can verify or exploit some of those
findings has been cumbersome in the past. A new Nessus plugin for
Metasploit allows you to work directly with your Nessus scan engine
over xmlrpc from within the comfort of your Metasploit console. No
more tabbing between windows to discover, catalog and exploit hosts.
Do it all from within Metasploit and save yourself time."

Nate's bio is below:

"Zate dabbles in threat/vulnerability management, appsec and pen
testing for a national staffing firm by day and by night learns Ruby
and hacks on metasploit/nessus integration. Previously he worked at
one of the "big 4" auditing firms doing application security and
threat/vulnerability management and prior to that blew things up for
the Australian Military."

Please RSVP to me (http://scr.im/mascasa) by Tuesday, December 7, so
that you can be added to the security list.

A reminder that CISSPs can earn 1 CPE credit for every hour of
attendance at OWASP meetings.

Thanks and see you there,
Justin Morehouse
