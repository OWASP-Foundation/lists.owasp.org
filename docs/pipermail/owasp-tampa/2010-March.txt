Subject: [Owasp-tampa] OWASP Tampa Chapter 2010-Q1 Meeting Reminder
Message-ID: <4c4fe6bf1003211605y57c7d0fcu7ddadf1432aba3cf@mail.gmail.com>

Just a reminder that our 2010-Q1 meeting will be this Wednesday, March
24, from 6pm to 8pm.

Trevor Hawthorn of Stratum Security will be presenting his ShmooCon
2010 talk: The New World of Smartphone Security - What Your iPhone
Disclosed About You.

"When most people think of Smartphone security, they think forensics,
encryption, screen locks, remote wipe, etc. This talk doesn't care
about that. The New World of SmartPhone Security tackles security
concerns that are not being discussed and have not been publicly
disclosed. In this talk we will examine mobile to mobile attacks
within cellular IP networks, the iPhone attack surface, iPhone worms,
iPhone location-based gaming privacy concerns, and iPhone web
application security. Proof of concept attacks, metrics gathered over
the last six months, and redacted data gathered during our research
will be presented."

Please RSVP to the chapter leader no later than Tuesday, March 23, so
that you can be added to the security list.

A reminder that CISSPs can earn 1 CPE credit for every hour of
attendance at OWASP meetings.

Thanks and see you there,

Justin Morehouse
