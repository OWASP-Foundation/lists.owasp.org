Subject: [Owasp-tampa] OWASP Tampa Q2 Meeting Reminder
Message-ID: <4c4fe6bf0905142031m315167eds1d78322357d09fd@mail.gmail.com>

Just a reminder that our next quarterly meeting will be held this
Wednesday, May 20, 2009 from 6PM to 8PM at the Kforce building in
Ybor. Zate Berg of Kforce
will be presenting OWASP's Open Software Assurance Maturity Model (Open SAMM).

"Open SAMM is a framework designed to help formulate and implement a
strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks
facing each organization."

For more information, visit the Tampa chapter at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Tampa

Please RSVP to me by this Monday, May 18, 2009 so that you can be
added to the security list.

A reminder that CISSPs can earn 1 CPE credit for every hour of
attendance at OWASP meetings.

Thanks and see you there,
Justin
