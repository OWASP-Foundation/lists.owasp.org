Hi Justin,
 I am planning to attend the March meeting. I am interested in hearing about security when using   
Mobile wallets.  The company I work for offers one and I started using it.  Im digging into the architecture and security myself but if you already know or have an expert in this area, I would like to see that presentation.  I'm sure you know that Europe already uses mobile wallets and have left the plastic credit card behind.  If you don't have an expert ready I can put the presentation together and run it by you.
Sunny
