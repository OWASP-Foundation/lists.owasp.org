Good Afternoon,

Planning is in the final stages for the 1st OWASP Tampa Day. The event will
run from 9:30 AM to 3 PM on Monday, June 20th at Tampa International
Airport. The event will feature 4 speakers, and will include lunch and
refreshments. Thanks to the event sponsors (WhiteHat Security, Qualys, and
Stratum Security), the event will be COMPLETELY FREE! There is a limited
number seats (60), and registration will be on a first come, first serve
basis.

I will send out the Eventbrite page once everything is finalized so that you
can reserve your spot, but I wanted everyone to block their calendar as soon
as possible. Also, please start spreading the news. This is a great way for
folks to get a 1/2 day of Application Security training for free. We are
focussing on developers and INFOSEC managers.

Stay tuned and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Justin

	Registration

On the heels of my previous email, everything has been finalized and
registration for OWASP Tampa Day 2011 is now officially open! You can
register at,

   - http://owasptampaday2011.eventbrite.com

Registration is limited to only 60 attendees, so I recommend registering as
soon as you know you can attend. The event is completely free!

I ask that you please let your friends and colleagues know about the event.
We need a good showing to keep the interest of sponsors who make events like
this free. Please try and invite at least two new people to the event
(developers and management types are an easy target).

Please contact me with any questions you may have and I hope to see you all
at the event on June 20th.

A big thanks to Kate Mullin @ Tampa Airport for securing the facilities for
us. Thanks Kate!

See you all on the 20th.

Justin
