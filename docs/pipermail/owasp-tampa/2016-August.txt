Speaker: Jonathan Echavarria

Title:  Red Team Operating in a modern environment: Learning to live off of
the land

Description: It's not 2006 anymore, modern enterprises typically have
powerful and varied defenses in place, or at least that's what they want
you to believe. From network protections to advanced host based
protections, you'll learn how these protections are typically deployed in
an enterprise, and why they aren't doing anywhere near as much as they
should be, and understand how to see these tools from a red team
perspective.

Speaker Bio: Jonathan Echavarria works as a Red Team Operator for
ReliaQuest, an IT Security Services company based out of Tampa, Florida.
His areas of focus are offensive operations, malware and exploit
development.

Food Sponsor:  ARCcorp www.arccorp.com
