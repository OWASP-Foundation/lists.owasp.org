Our next quarterly meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 20, 2009
from 6PM to 8PM at the Kforce building in Ybor. Zate Berg of Kforce
will be presenting OWASP's Open Software Assurance Maturity Model
(Open SAMM).

"Open SAMM is a framework designed to help formulate and implement a
strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks
facing each organization."

Please RSVP to me by Monday, May 18, 2009 so that you can be added to
the security list.

A reminder that CISSPs can earn 1 CPE credit for every hour of
attendance at OWASP meetings.

Thanks and see you there,
Justin
