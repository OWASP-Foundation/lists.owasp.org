second presentation which will be a hands-on workshop covering tools
contained within the latest version of Backtrack. Their bios abstracts are
below:

allows for the clear text recovery of encrypted web traffic? Stay tuned. In
this presentation the Browser Exploit Against SSL / TLS will be demystified

presentation will then be driven into a live demonstration of some general
web application penetration testing techniques against DVWA and NOWASP
(Mutillidae) hosted on the Metasploitable 2 VM platform.
