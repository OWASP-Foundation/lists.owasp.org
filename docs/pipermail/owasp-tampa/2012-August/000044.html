<PRE>The Tampa Bay ISSA chapter asked that I pass along the following event
notification.

---

*It's time for the 1st Annual Tampa Bay ISSA Hack the Flag/Chili Cookoff.*

*This year's competition will be held on Saturday, September 22, 2012 from
12:00pm - 5:00pm at*

*American Legion, 3810 W. Kennedy Blvd. Tampa, FL 33609.*

We will have two *Hack the Flag* competitions. One will be an advanced game
for the *Ninja* hackers and the other will be a game for newer security
professionals, *Samurai*. You can create your own team of 2-5 people, or if
you do not have a team you can request to be added to one at the time of
registration. For team members registering, please specify your team name
at the time of registration so we will know which people are on the same
team.

*NOTE: Each team member must register individually for the event, and only
one registration per person will be honored. All attendees must PRE-**
REGISTER* &lt;<A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2626261218/eorg">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2626261218/eorg</A>&gt;*. IMPORTANT:
You MUST bring your registration confirmation with you to gain entry to the
event. Space is limited so sign up early: **

*!!! PRIZES !!!  - The winning Samurai team will receive $250 and the Ninja
team will receive $400. The winner of the chili contest will receive $50!*



*Registration - FREE*

Both competitions require teams between 2-5 members each.

When you register, please specify what competition you would like to
participate in, if any, and your team name. If you do not have a team, you
will be assigned to one. Registration is required to attend the event and
is limited so be sure you sign up early. *

*Chili Cook Off*

In addition to our *Hack The Flag* we will also be hosting our 1st annual
Chili Cook Off, which always makes the *Hack The Flag* event much more
interesting. Anyone can bring in their best chili to be tasted and tested
by the rest. You do not have to compete in the *Hack The Flag* games to
compete in the Chili Cook Off, simply specify you will be bringing Chili on
the registration page. In addition to the chili, TB ISSA will be providing
drinks, adult beverages and other snacks.


*Legal Stuff*

As with any computer system there is always a risk of data loss. We
strongly encourage you to backup your computer before attending the event.
There are several software tools that will be in use at the event that
could cause data loss. You agree to participate in this event at your own
risk and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless Tampa Bay ISSA, its directors, officers and
agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees.
