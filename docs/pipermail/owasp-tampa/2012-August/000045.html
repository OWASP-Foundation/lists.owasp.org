<PRE>28th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC 2012)
Buena Vista Palace Hotel &amp; Spa in the Walt Disney World Resort, Florida, USA
3-7 December 2012
<A HREF="http://www.acsac.org">http://www.acsac.org</A>


Registration is open and the draft program is published.  There is still
time to make a submission of posters, works-in-progress, and to our two
workshops: LAW and CCW.  Students interested in participating at this year's
conference but with partial financial assistance, should consider applying
for a conferenceship.  And we encourage all participants to urge their
company, agency, or institution to become a sponsor or exhibitor at ACSAC
(which could get you free admittance).  More information on all of these
great opportunities follows below.

===============================================================

1. Program

This year's outstanding technical program includes keynotes by Ron Ross
(NIST) and Eran Feigenbaum (Google), a classic book presentation by Ross
Anderson (Univ of Cambridge), an Invited Essay by Susan Alexander (IARPA),
44 peer-reviewed paper presentations, panels, case studies,
works-in-progress, and posters. In addition, we will have two days of
professional development courses and workshops, including the Layered
Assurance Workshop (LAW) and Cloud Computing Workshop (CCW). 
 
Keep up with your continuing education requirements by attending
professional development courses, Government training sessions, and the
technical program.  The professional development courses include Tracer
FIRE, a two-day hands-on forensic and incident response exercise, as well as
courses covering web security, botnets and malware, risk analysis,
virtualization, software protection, and intrusion detection.  The
Government training track includes sessions on the latest NIST FISMA/Joint
Transformational documents, including NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, the
upcoming NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4, NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1 (including the
approach for national security systems in CNSSI 1253), and NIST SP 800-39.

The draft program may be viewed at <A HREF="https://www.acsac.org/2012/program/">https://www.acsac.org/2012/program/</A>

===============================================================

2. Registration

Registration is now open.  The hotel registration at the conference rate
(government per diem rate) ends on November 12.  Please register early
because the hotel is very crowded this year during ACSAC week with other
meetings/conferences and the rate is available until the room block is
filled.  Remember to use the link to the hotel for your reservations to be
sure that you are counted in our room block and assure you are getting the
correct discounted hotel rate. 
 
Receive a $100 discount off your conference fee by first making your room
reservation at the conference hotel, and then entering your reservation
number in the conference registration form.

===============================================================

3. Call for Posters &amp; Works-in-Progress  

There is still time to submit a Poster or Work-in-Progress to ACSAC 2012.
Submissions are due September 3, 2012.
 
The Works in Progress (WiP) session packs as many 5-minute presentations as
possible into one fast paced and popular session. These presentations
highlight some of the most current work in computer security and are an
excellent opportunity to get feedback on your project or idea from the
community or find interested collaborators.
 
<A HREF="https://www.acsac.org/2012/cfp/wip/">https://www.acsac.org/2012/cfp/wip/</A>
 
The Poster session offers you a chance to present your work to the security
community in an informal, interactive manner. Posters can present completed
projects or might represent interesting results from preliminary or
exploratory work. Poster presenters will have an opportunity to discuss
their research in depth with other interested attendees.

===============================================================

4. LAW Workshop CFP    
 
The Layered Assurance Workshop (LAW) concerns itself with the fundamental
problems of compositional assurance and the need for principles, methods,
and techniques that can be applied to achieve the assurance necessary for
security-critical, safety-critical, and mission-critical components and
systems.  LAW has provided a forum for vital exchange, as well as a maturing
source of information, focused on key issues related to the effective and
efficient modular construction and certification of assured systems from
assured components. It is widely recognized that such an approach is the
most promising way to achieve diverse and flexible systems that can be
certified quickly and cost effectively.  Now in its 6th year, LAW has
matured to become a recognized venue for practitioners and researchers
interested in the development and certification of assured systems. More
information can be found at:
 
<A HREF="https://www.acsac.org/2012/workshops/law/">https://www.acsac.org/2012/workshops/law/</A>

===============================================================

5. CCW Workshop CFP
 
This year's Issues Workshop will focus on cloud computing security, how
users of cloud systems can be educated to maintain the security posture of
their systems, and how to improve the state of the art of cloud computing.
The workshop will also look at the need to facilitate research and
development of the next generation of cloud computing security standards and
tools to assist in the creation of better, more secure systems.  Cloud
computing presents a number of security concerns due to the nature of the
cloud, including the following: data protection, identity management,
authentication and authorization standards, policy management, and
virtualization process implementation. Infrastructures for the cloud may be
built on servers using different types of technologies, including different
methods of virtualization that have risks associated with their use.
Participants are encouraged but not required to submit position papers due
October 1, 2012. More information can be found at:

<A HREF="https://www.acsac.org/2012/workshops/ccw/">https://www.acsac.org/2012/workshops/ccw/</A>

===============================================================

6. Sponsorships     

Attend the ACSAC technical program for free!  Have your organization sponsor
ACSAC at the Silver or Gold level, and you will get a free conference pass.
As a nonprofit with an all-volunteer staff, ACSAC seeks sponsorships in
order to support a conference that stresses the interaction between our
academic, governmental and industry participants.  By sponsoring ACSAC, we
are pleased to make available benefits to your organization that include
complementary registration, collateral material distribution to attendees,
and recognition in marketing materials such as the ACSAC web site, on-site
signage, and mobile, online and printed programs. For additional information
on becoming an ACSAC sponsor, visit:

<A HREF="https://www.acsac.org/2012/sponsors/">https://www.acsac.org/2012/sponsors/</A>

===============================================================

7. Student Conferenceships

ACSAC offers conferenceships for students who otherwise would not be able to
attend the conference. Conferenceship awards will normally take the form of
partial to full reimbursement (after the student attends the conference) to
be applied against conference registration and travel/lodging expenses.
 
For interested students, conferenceships are also available to cover
registration costs for Tracer FIRE.  Again, students receiving these awards
will receive reimbursement after registering for Tracer FIRE and attending
this two-day, highly stimulating and educational forensics and incident
response exercise.  Tracer FIRE will be held immediately prior to the main
conference program on December 3 and 4.
 
Applicants applying by September 3, 2012 will receive priority review and
approval. More information can be found at:
