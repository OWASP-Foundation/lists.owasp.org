Tampa OWASP Chapter,

I wanted to see if anyone would be interested in presenting at the BSides Security conference that will take place on February 21st at the MOSI? If there is interest, please send an abstract of your presentation to: CFP at BSidesTampa.net. The format is expected to be one hour with 15 minutes at the end saved for a Q&A session with the audience. The presentation will be filmed by the Iron Geek unless indicated otherwise. If your chapter would like to possibly attend as a community sponsor, please contact: BSidesTampaBay at Outlook.com.

Thank you
RJ Stine
