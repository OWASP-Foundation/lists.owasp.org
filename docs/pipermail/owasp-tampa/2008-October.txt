Subject: [Owasp-tampa] First OWASP Tampa Meeting
Message-ID: <4c4fe6bf0810262100k3e1f833ar5623a72a7084ef24@mail.gmail.com>

We've secured a location for this quarter's meeting at the Kforce building
in Ybor. I've posted the details to the wiki,
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Tampa. I'll send out another email once I've
identified a speaker. If you have any topic requests or would like to speak,
please email me.

Thanks,
Justin
