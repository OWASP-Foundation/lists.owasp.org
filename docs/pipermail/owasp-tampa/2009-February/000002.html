<PRE>Because of a scheduling error we had to change the date of this quarter's
meeting from next Wednesday, 2/18, to the following Wednesday, 2/25. Please
RSVP to me by Monday, February 23, so that I can add you to the security
list. If you have already RSVP'd for the original meeting date of 2/18,
please send me an updated RSVP for 2/25.

Below is information on this quarter's meeting.

Our next quarterly meeting will be held on *Wednesday, February 25, 2009*from
*6:00 PM to 8:00 PM*. The meeting will be held at our usual location; the
Kforce &lt;<A HREF="http://www.kforce.com/">http://www.kforce.com/</A>&gt; building in Ybor.

Please *RSVP* to the chapter leader by Monday, February 23, 2009 so that we
can add you to the security list. *Matt Flick*, Principal at FYRM
Associates&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fyrmassociates.com/">http://www.fyrmassociates.com/</A>&gt;,
will be presenting his *Black Hat DC 2009* talk: *XSS Anonymous Browser*.
*&quot;Current anonymous Internet browsing applications build dynamic routes
using a network of willing hosts and layers of encryption along the route.
The cross site scripting anonymous browser (&quot;XAB&quot;) exploits vulnerable web
sites/applications and victim browsers to build a network of drones. The
intent of XAB is not to replace the current applications, such as Tor, but
rather to provide an alternative that does not require willing participants
and further stretches the functionality and intent of JavaScript and other
browser technology.&quot;*

 Thanks and see you on the 25th.

Justin
