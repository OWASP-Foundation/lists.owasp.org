CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) is an
internationally recognized forum where practitioners, researchers, and
developers in information and system security meet to learn and to exchange
practical ideas and experiences. If you are developing, researching, or
implementing practical security solutions, consider sharing your experience
and expertise at ACSAC.

We are especially interested in submissions that address the application of
security technology, the implementation of systems, and lessons learned.
Some example topics are:

	* Access control
	* Assurance
	* Audit
	* Biometrics
	* Boundary control
	* Cloud security
	* Cybersecurity
	* Denial of service protection
	* Distributed systems security
	* Electronic commerce security
	* Enterprise security management
	* Forensics
	* Identity management
	* Incident response planning
	* Insider threat protection
	* Integrity
	* Intellectual property rights protection
	* Intrusion detection and prevention
	* Malware
	* Mobile and wireless security
	* Multimedia security
	* Network resiliency
	* Operating systems security
	* Peer-to-peer security
	* Privacy and data protection
	* Privilege management
	* Product evaluation and compliance
	* Resilience
	* Security engineering
	* Security usability
	* Software security
	* Supply chain risk
	* Trust management
	* Virtualization security
	* VoIP security
	* Web 2.0/3.0 security


SUBMISSION DEADLINES:

     Technical Papers*	1 June 2012
     Case Studies		1 June 2012
     Panels		1 June 2012
     Training*		1 June 2012
     Workshops		1 June 2012
     Posters		3 September 2012
     Works-in-Progress	3 September 2012
     Conferenceships	3 September 2012

* All paper and course/training submissions are peer-reviewed in a
double-blind process. Also, awards will be given to the best paper and best
student paper. Authors of the best papers will be invited to submit an
extended version of their paper for publication in a premiere security
journal (pending approval - details to be announced later).


TECHNICAL TRACK PAPER SUBMISSIONS:

Chair: Michael Locasto, University of Calgary
Co-Chair: Patrick Traynor, Georgia Institute of Technology 

We solicit papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied
security. Papers are encouraged on results that have been demonstrated to be
useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons
learned from actual application.

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference
with proceedings. Please ensure that your submission is a PDF file of a
maximum of 10 pages (including all references and appendices) generated
according to the ACM instructions at
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates,">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates,</A> using the
template Option 2 &quot;WITH permission block&quot;. Committee members are not
required to read the appendices. All submissions must be anonymous (i.e.,
papers should not contain author names or affiliations, or obvious
citations). In the rare case that citing previous work in the 3rd person is
impossible, blind the reference and notify the PC Chair. Both of these
constraints (page limit and anonymity) are hard constraints. Submissions not
meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their
merits.


CASE STUDIES IN APPLIED SECURITY:

Chair: Steven Rome, Booz Allen Hamilton
Co-Chair: Larry Wagoner, NSA

The Case Studies in Applied Security Track is a critical part of the
technical conference. It is an opportunity for professionals to share
information that is current without writing a detailed technical paper, but
enables attendees to learn about the next generation of products and
solutions. It is open to anyone in the community such as vendors, network
providers, systems integrators, government civil/federal/military programs
or users across the spectrum of computer security applications. Potentially
this is where attendees can learn about client needs and vendors solutions.
This year we are especially interested in automated solutions based on
existing knowledge. While the Case Studies will not be included in the
Proceedings, the presentations will be posted to the ACSAC site following
the conference. 


PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSES (TRAINING):

Chair: Daniel Faigin, The Aerospace Corporation

Training courses are full (6 hour) or half (3 hour) day classes on how to
apply or use a particular technology to address a security need. A typical
course submission includes an abstract of the course, a brief (1-2 page)
outline, an instructor bio, an indication of length, and notes on
prerequisites and textbooks. Course instructors receive an honorarium and
expenses. If you would like to indicate a topic you would like to see, you
may do that as well; please suggest an instructor if you can. 


PANELS:

Chair: Kevin Butler, University of Oregon   

Panels are encouraged on the topics listed above. Panels may frame a debate
on a controversial question or summarize interesting results, but they must
encourage audience participation. A typical submission will include a
proposed moderator, panel members (usually 3-5) and an abstract of the
proposed topic. 


POSTERS &amp; WORKS-IN-PROGRESS:

Chair: Benjamin Kuperman, Oberlin College 

The poster session provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners
to present their new and innovative preliminary work in an informal,
interactive setting. Conference attendees can learn about novel on-going
research projects that might not yet be complete, but whose preliminary
results are already interesting. Poster presenters will have an opportunity
to discuss their work and get invaluable feedback from knowledgeable sources
at an early stage of their research. 

The Works in Progress (WiP) session offers short presentations (5 minutes
maximum) of ongoing work. These presentations highlight the most current
work in both business and academia, emphasizing goals and value added,
accomplishments to date, and future plans. Special consideration is given to
topics that discuss real life security experience, including system
implementation, deployment, and lessons learned. 


WORKSHOPS:

Chair: Harvey Rubinovitz, The MITRE Corporation

ACSAC workshops are on up to date topics that attendees usually rate to
provide a useful and exciting forum for information technology professionals
(e.g., standards developers, software developers, security engineers,
security officers) to exchange ideas, concerns, and opinions. 


STUDENT CONFERENCESHIPS:

ACSAC offers conferenceships for students who otherwise would not be able to
attend the conference. The conferenceship covers hotel, registration and a
cash award to help defray the costs with transportation and food.
Application deadline is 3 Sept 2012.
