Just a reminder that our first meeting is one week from today,
Wednesday, November 19th from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM at the Kforce
building in Ybor.

Tony Flick will be speaking on the pitfalls of Google Code Search.

Also, I have confirmed that CISSPs can earn a CPE for every hour of
attendance.

Finally, some of us will be heading for sushi and potentially stogies after
the meeting. All are welcome to join.

See the OWASP Tampa web page, https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Tampa, for
more details.

See you next week.

Justin
