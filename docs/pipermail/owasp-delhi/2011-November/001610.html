<PRE>Dear All,

As you are aware that last year various OWASP Delhi committees were formed
with industry professionals in order to take forward the OWASP flagship and
its mission. First of all, I would like to Thank Padma, Neelu, Deepayan for
helping out last year as active committee members.

Though the committees had lot more members but there were very few active
members/leaders who could really extend their support or help. Its a
volunteer effort so we can't force anyone for contribution, however in such
scenarios opportunity to serve the committee should be transferred to
others. Its the time to revive the committees for 2012 since previous was
meant for 1 year only.

In case you wish to contribute for this cause by nominating yourself as a
committee member, please write me offline with your brief profile and how
you can help us grow.

Friends who wish to come on the committee board as a passive member, please
afford to allow other active members. Here is the document for the last
year: <A HREF="https://owasp.org/images/b/b3/OWASP_Delhi_Committee_Announcement.pdf">https://owasp.org/images/b/b3/OWASP_Delhi_Committee_Announcement.pdf</A>

Many Thanks,
Dhruv
