Some free and useful VAPT tools can be the below ones (I am assuming for
web app purpose):

OWASP ZAP (Attack Proxy) -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project
IronWASP - https://ironwasp.org
Netsparker Community Edition - https://www.netsparker.com/communityedition/
SQL Map - http://sqlmap.org/
Nikto -https://cirt.net/Nikto2
Burp Suite (Free Edition) - http://portswigger.net/burp/download.html

Others may add into this list

1. you get the tool list from the comparison report
2. you will know the where a tool stands on particular benchmark point i.e
weakness and strength.

Thanks for the reply,

I am looking for a solution to get rid of storing credential in RAM for
browser process.

I thought salted hash password will be good solution.

Dear Sanjay

Salt is used in web app and also in Unix password files.

1.In webapp

In web applications salted hash is used to secure the password from replay attack.

Salt or any random number is generated at server and sent to browser. There hash is derived using the hash of password plus salt.

Hash(hash(password))+salt)

This is sent on net and received by webserver.

Server already knows your salt . It gets the password or hash of password from database table. Then does operation. Hash(hash(password)+salt) it compares it with received hash from client ie browser.

Does the authentication as usual.

2. In Unix password file salt is part of the password. See net for that.

I got another interesting article on "
https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Secure_Coding_Guidelines#Password_Storage
".

The idea here is NOT to store "Simply Hashed Password" & "Salt".

As per the article:--

Password Storage

Separate from the password policy, we should have the following standards
when it comes to storing passwords:

   - Passwords stored in a database should using the hmac+bcrypt function.

The purpose of hmac and bcrypt storage is as follows:

   - bcrypt provides a hashing mechanism which can be configured to consume
   sufficient time to prevent brute forcing of hash values even with many
   computers
   - bcrypt can be easily adjusted at any time to increase the amount of
   work and thus provide protection against more powerful systems
   - The nonce for the hmac value is designed to be stored on the file
   system and not in the databases storing the password hashes. In the event
   of a compromise of hash values due to SQL injection, the nonce will still
   be an unknown value since it would not be compromised from the file system.
   This significantly increases the complexity of brute forcing the
   compromised hashes considering both bcrypt and a large unknown nonce value
   - The hmac operation is simply used as a secondary defense in the event
   there is a design weakness with bcrypt that could leak information about
   the password or aid an attacker

A sample of this code is here: https://github.com/fwenzel/django-sha2

Keep in mind that while bcrypt is secure you should still enforce good
passwords. As slow as an algorithm may be if a password is "123" it still
would only take a short amount of time before somebody figures it out.

Hi,

There are some open questions ? Are u planning not to have ssl? As ssl ll
prevent replay etc. Secondly sending hashed paswd nd salt can just prevent
extracting password from sent data..still u ll need to ensure that u are
connecting to correct host...make sure session tokens are protected
etc....so even ur first attempt to auth can b compromised without ssl or
equivalent....another thing i wanted to point out is if you are using
hash(hash(passwd) +salt) then does it mean that u are storing plain hashed
password in DB?...this means weakning the security at server
side....finally i am not sure if u ll do this then also u might get plain
passwd in memory of browser(not sure)..unless u are creating some thin
client and overwriting same memory

small correction
?
1.The user submits the UID & Password through HTTPS-POST method, which is received by Web/AppServer - at the time of registration
2.Application logic takes the "plain password" and generates an output based on Keyed/Salted-HMAC algorithm & stores it in DB
3.When user wants to authenticate - user submits the UID & Password through HTTPS-POST method, which is received by Web/AppServer4a. Application logic takes the "plain password" and generates an output based on Keyed/Salted-HMAC algorithm4b. Application logic loads the corresponding HMACed password of that specific user from DB & compares the generated HMAC & Stored HMAC4c. If both matches then login is successful - else authentication failed message is shown.
Advantages:1. Internal employees/DB admins cannot use the stored HMACs to login to a user's account2. BruteForce or replay attacks can be avoided3. Rainbow tables can be avoided

 Dear Sir/Madame

 The very purpose of salted hash implementation is to avoid transport of plain text password from client side to the server with/without HTTPS.

 The salted hash password is computed on client side and sent to the server which is compared with the computed (with hashed password retrieved from DB) salted hash on the server side. If the salted hash from client compares ok with salted hash on server side logic then  login is successful.

 For information.

 Thanks

Understood the confusion & here is my gentle response with some corrections
1] Salted Hash are not generated on client side - WHY ???? a] To generate salted hash on client side - you need to send the "salt or the key" to client as part of web page???????? which is a bad practice in a web application - whether you use http or https(ssl)
??? b] an attacker can steal the "salt" and conduct rainbow attacks & you should never send your secrets out of your server
??? c] if HTTPS is not used then a man-in-middle attack can capture the "HMAC" output and user-id and replay the same??????? thereby account takeover can happen
2] The Salted HMAC implementation that you were referring might be happening in "Unix/Linux" environment and not in???? web application systems
3] On unix/linux environments this is possible since the keys or salts are pre-shared as part of "Installation/Setup" of domain logins???? or network login setup
4] In Web Application the Salted HMAC doesn't work like this
5] Whether it is Paypal/Ebay/Amazon web apps all store their passwords as an output of Keyed/Salted HMACs
6] Just check the login page of any webpage -- you'll never find any HMAC Code(Javascript) in the login page
Hope this helps.

Hi,


Are we not forgetting the birthday paradox when storing password in DB
without using salt in hash creation?

Hi All,

I would like to know about the current best practises related to the use of
rate limiting functions on a web registration form which is customer
facing, i.e. on organisation's public page where the use of CAPTCHA is
frowned upon by the management due to reduced user experience. If you are
working in finance domain you probably would appreciate why CAPTCHAs are
not the best approach for a customer facing site.

Any suitable alternative would be appreciated. Please let me know if
additional information is required.

Regards,
Reuben

Dear Reuben,

I agree captcha is deterrent even for legitimate traffic. You can use a simple algorithm to capture IP address of the submitted response and validating that ip address for multiple submissions in x minutes or y hours and suspending that particular submission for some time.

You may wish to additionally parameters like browser agent, referrer location, screen resolution and data stored in form cookies to fine tune your algorithm to create unique parameter to validate requests.

Regarding suspension or showing user some deterrent message ? you have already submitted ? etc, I would like to recommend creating a spam trap, redirect first submission to production database and all possible spam responses to a spam-trap data base for reason of collecting intelligence to fine tune your algorithm and to manage false positives.

Note: All these must be included as server side controls, any control towards user side can be easily rendered useless.

Cheers,
Tarun Gupta

I think Google Recaptcha's latest version solves this problem to great
extend!

From: hw at hardwear.io (Hardwear Team)
Date: Fri, 29 May 2015 11:51:39 +0530
Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] hardwear.io - Hardware Security Conference Call for
	Papers
Message-ID: <CAMUeWmgB-CmB4Zb4h9aErWDDDn-BNHfG9MVUpsMYunEfkX35jA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Hackers and Security Gurus,

hardwear is seeking innovative research on hardware security. If you
have done interesting research on attacks or mitigation on any
Hardware and want to showcase it to the security community, just
submit your research paper. Please find all the relevant details for
the submission below.

About hardwear.io
----------------------------
Somewhere in the mid of last year, amidst all the news and concerns
surrounding trust and backdoors in hardware equipment, Hardwear was
conceptualized to provide the IT and security community with a
platform to discuss and solve issues pertaining to hardware security.
The objective of the conference revolves around four key concerns in
hardware, firmware and related protocols i.e. backdoors, exploits,
trust and attacks (BETA).

Dates:
Training: 29th - 39th Sept 2015
Conference: 1-2nd Oct 2015

Venue:
The Hague, Netherlands

General Queries: antriksh at hardwear.io
CFP Queries:      cfp at hardwear.io


Topics
-----------
hardwear accepts papers on any topic that discusses in-depth hardware
and firmware security both from the offensive as well as defensive
perspective. Some of the topics of interest include (but not limited
to):

- Integrated Circuits

Categories
---------------------------
1. New Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? is a deep knowledge technical track
that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased before, it will fall under current research
category even though there are enhancements/changes to the original
research.

2. Current Research (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Submission Format
------------------------------
