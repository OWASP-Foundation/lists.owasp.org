If it&#8217;s escaping the script in HTML entities like &amp;lt for &lt; then it&#8217;s escaping it well. But don&#8217;t be sure try other variants too. 

 

&gt;&gt;<i>Will u go to inject every varient of the script provided at the RSnake. Even then how would you so sure again....

Depends..and probably yes&#8230;Not only that , I will try my libraries as well. The more variants you have the more assured you are.

Although RSnake&#8217;s cheat sheet is exhaustive but you need to test depending on the application&#8217;s environment and technology.

Sometimes &lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt; won&#8217;t work but &#8220;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt; will work.

 

&gt;&gt;<i>Is there any mechanism like seeing the escaping within the response that is done by the application to know what type of escaping the application is

performing and just enhancing the scripts variants accordingly...

 

You may try different things, for example: if application using decoding the URL encoded payloads supplied by the browser and not output escaping them after, then it might be vulnerable.

So you have to try different things. You have to be more diverse.

 

I would suggest, first run any scanner and then do manual testing. That will be comprehensive testing.

 

I think I am clear&#8230;if not kindly revert back.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Regarding XSS

 

Dear All,

 

While testing for an XSS issue within a website. How do you be so sure that there is no XSS within a parameter.

 

This is because one varient of the script will work and one will not because of the input validation/output escaping done by the application.

 

How can you be so sure that u have tested all varients of the scripts.

 

Will u go to inject every varient of the script provided at the RSnake. Even then how would you so sure again....

 

Is there any mechanism like seeing the escaping within the response that is done by the application to know what type of escaping the application is 

performing and just enhancing the scripts varients accordingly...

 

Please suggest......


Waiting for the reply....
