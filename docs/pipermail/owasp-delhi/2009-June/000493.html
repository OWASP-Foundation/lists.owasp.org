<PRE>I think most of the time it is done by recovery agencies. They use the
technique of pretending as courier service to grab the address of the
defaulter and then sends court's summon or may be recovery agents. One need
not to default something to become defaulter, there have been many incidents
in the past where a mobile number/credit card/etc. is allocated to a fake
person using identification of some real person. These recovery teams are
well equipped with all internet techniques like google/social
networks/naukri.com etc. so finding the history of a well connected person
isn't a great deal. I don't see it a big problem. Let them try their fate
and if they find you, make their life miserable. Next time they ring you up,
pass on my address ;-)

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Reporting Phishing Attack

 

hi All, 

Wanted to report a Phishing attack which is happening as I write this email.


I have been recieving number of calls from the below numbers for the last
week or so. The caller poses as a courier service provider trying to phish
my address. Subsequent to that he tries to phish my company name and DOB.
This has been going on for the past week or so, and calls have come to my
home landline nos and my mobile no. The caller seems to know my full name
and my previous company name as well. I havent been able to trace the nos as
of now.. but any help from any one would be great. 


These are the nos from which the call is coming.
911166209888
911166209666
919999887951
919999768237
919999798702

Also if you see the links below, you would notice that I am not alone. Many
folks have received similar calls. I truly believe this is a phishing
attack. it could be credit card fraud or otherwise. 
Any help in tracing these nos would be of great help? the 6620 nos is
actually TATA service provider. The 9999 series is vodafone in Delhi. Any
contacts which we can use?

Any contacts in Economic Offense wing in Delhi where we can report this?
