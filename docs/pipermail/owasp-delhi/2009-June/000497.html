<PRE>Hi Parmendra,

&gt;&gt;<i> You may try different things, for example: if application using decoding the URL encoded payloads supplied by the browser and not output escaping them after, then it might be &gt;&gt;vulnerable.So you &gt;&gt;have to try different things. You have to be more diverse.
</I>
It means when you supply any payload inside browser, the browser first encodes it into URLEncoded format and passes it to your application. Again your application needs to decode it using decoding functions to convert it into original form.

For example: &lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt; will be passed as %3cscript%3e&#8230;.format by browser to the application and application needs some URLDecode function to convert it into original format to understand it:

&lt;script&gt;&#8230;.&lt;/script&gt;

Again it has to be escaped before displaying it as it is in executable format &lt;script&gt;&#8230;&lt;/script&gt;.

The sample code for URL decoding and output escaping process in PHP is:

htmlspecialchars(urldecode($URL contents))

Here the URL contents are first decoded back by application and then output escaped by htmlspecialchars() function so  that it can&#8217;t gets executed.

As far as libraries is concerned it&#8217;s not more than collection of several XSS injection attack strings and variants which you collect from different resources like RSnake.

Hope it solves your query.

Dear Sir,

 

Highly greatful to you for your feedback......The way you explain the problem is excellent.

 

I am confused on the last explaination which is shown below. Kindly brief it a little bit.

And you talked about using some libraries to test for XSS. May i know from where i can get those libraries.

&gt;&gt;<i>Is there any mechanism like seeing the escaping within the response that is done by the application to know what type of escaping the application is 
</I>
performing and just enhancing the scripts variants accordingly...

 

You may try different things, for example: if application using decoding the URL encoded payloads supplied by the browser and not output escaping them after, then it might be vulnerable.

So you have to try different things. You have to be more diverse.

 

Thanks a lot :-)
