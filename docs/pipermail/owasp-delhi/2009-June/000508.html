<PRE>Hi Parmendra,

 

    Every variable in the program has certain amount of memory space allocated to it.  It is used to buffer data. When a very high volume of data is supplied to this particular space and there&#8217;s no input validation in application that checks for amount of data being inserted, it&#8217;s prone to buffer overflow. It can lead to some verbose errors being displayed, memory corruption or even application crashing.

For testing purpose, overwhelm the all input entries with much more volume of data and see how it is handling it.

 

As far as DOS is concerned it&#8217;s simply Denial of Service of a particular application, which becomes unaccessible to any legitimate user creating business losses. Many reasons can cause DOS like:

Buffer Overflow: Application Crashes

Automated Submission: Using any automated program/tool which can automatically submit any feedback/regisration form in the application several times causing the line to be busy and thus not usable by any legitimate user. That&#8217;s why CAPTCHAS are used.

SQL Injection: They can also create DOS. Like if the query  &#8216;; SHUTDOWN &#8216; is executed by the application, the database will be shutdown causing DOS.

Apart from these there may be n/w security issues too.

 

Wait for other members&#8217; comments too..
