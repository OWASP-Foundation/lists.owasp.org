<PRE>Dear Parmendra

 

I would believe that the most comprehensive methods of testing an application for this issue is to use: 

1.       Multiple browsers and multiple versions of the browsers &#8211; because some XSS variants work in the way a different browsers (and their versions) manipulate Javascript.

2.       Identify the web server and version and run a google search for whether it is vulnerable to XSS. 

3.       XSS Variants and their different avatars: You can try all types of XSS, including XSS designed to evade popular filters. escape characters, attribute based XSS (using onclick, onload,etc), evasion filter breaking like using extra spaces or splitting the script tag. 

4.       DOM based XSS testing, because it is purely client side and it you can also gain insight (in some cases where the Javascript is embedded into the html or by dumping the website files into your machine for analysis using  a HTTrack or equivalent) by having a look at the way javascript embedded in the html page. 

5.       Sometimes, in a vulnerable PHP Application, there is a situation where the application has a source code disclosure vulnerability and by using &#8220;php$&#8221;, so you might glean some information about the input validation,etc.

 

I would recommend that an initial basic vulnerability scanner be run before doing manual pen testing. It tends to be more comprehensive. Besides, a combination of manual and automated is what is recommended. 

 

Would like to know if anyone wants to add to this.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Regarding XSS

 

Dear All,

 

While testing for an XSS issue within a website. How do you be so sure that there is no XSS within a parameter.

 

This is because one varient of the script will work and one will not because of the input validation/output escaping done by the application.

 

How can you be so sure that u have tested all varients of the scripts.

 

Will u go to inject every varient of the script provided at the RSnake. Even then how would you so sure again....

 

Is there any mechanism like seeing the escaping within the response that is done by the application to know what type of escaping the application is 

performing and just enhancing the scripts varients accordingly...

 

Please suggest......


Waiting for the reply....
