Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] How to implement ASLR & DEP in C# thick client
	applications?
Message-ID: <CAPHKmPPArES3=5Jy1Mz17WQ0QeVEv4s1ajt2zp61QtXYUsv2nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Does anyone knows how to implement ASLR (Address Space Layout
Randomization), DEP (Data Execution Prevention) in thick client application
based on C#?

If it cannot be implement then what is the risk in applications which
developed in C#?

Regards,

Sanjay Kumar

Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] Anti-CSRF token in cookie and post form
Message-ID: <CAGsSLnU0UOO_Biihju9jk6kP78eBLbH2vahRAgw2sbgpBMVvKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I recently encountered an application which was having its random anti-csrf
token in cookie and the same random token was sent in the POST form. If I
tamper the cookie and the post form anti-CSRF token with the same value,
server will validate my request.

Example:

POST /account/delete
HOST: XYZ
Cookie: CSRF_Token=123456

account_id=10101&CSRF_Token=123456

Now the problem is that we can not manipulate cookie value with Javascript
and hence cannot fiddle with the anti-csrf token present in cookie. Is
there a way to create a working exploit?

Apologies if I am unable to clear the scenario.

Thanks
Vaibhav

Not one I can think of as the whole point of using a random nonce here is
based on same origin policy of the cookie.

Also there is possiblity the validation on server side could be between
post variable and server side cookie rather than one sent by client. This
would make tampering request useless.

Hi Sanjay,
These are compile/build time flags from Visual Studio or any SDK's used to build Windows binaries.

:D I meant session variables... They can be referred to as server side
cookies I believe.

A lot of web applications keep session-cookie as secure and other cookies
as it is. If that is the scenario, adversary will be able to sniff the
cookie and get the CSRF Token.

"Now the problem is that we can not manipulate cookie value with Javascript
"

I didn't understand the above statement. Are you saying that this cookie
has Httponly attribute set?

Thanks
Pankaj

Hi,

I dont think that keeping TokenID in both(cookie and in HTML page) will be
a good option for CSRF.
As far the HTML has a valid TokenID, we can handle the CSRF.

Please correct me if get it wrong.

Amit Saini

Hi,

Keeping a anti CSRF token is not only used, such that we can validate them
against token sent with request payload. One of the benefit of keeping
token in cookie is we can dynamically attach the token with every request
that is sent from the client using javascript. And the same origin policy
of the cookie will ensure "evil" websites cannot access this cookie. Now
benefit of this method is, you don't need to add a CSRF token in each of
your forms or ajax requests, you can write a wrapper in JS,  that does this
for every FORM elements and ajax requests.

This is the same design pattern used in CSRF Protector project,
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRFProtector_Project

.NET since 2.0 has DEP on (via NXCOMPAT). And since the code is JIT, you don't need to worry about ASLR either.?

So in short - a C# Winform application running on CLR has DEP and ASLR enabled by default.?

Hi Sanjay,
Code Caves and DEP/ASLR are two different things.DEP/ASLR are used to protect (shell)code execution from non executable locations,say, stack, heap etc.Code Caves present in a binary can be exploited irrespective of programming language used in creating the binary.
Best Regards, ?

Glad to have helped.?Well, Code caves may not work - but if the app is not Authenticoded/signed - then you can always ildasm, inject your custom code, ilasm, update the modified app in the MSI tables and then ship the app. In fact, you can take it a step further and sign the code with a misspelt domain as well such as Miicrosoft :P

Hi Amit,

Just a suggestion. Would it be possible to restrict the use of concurrent
sessions in your instance? Implementing such checks may help prevent
multiple application connections  purportedly originating from the same
user identity.

Reuben
Hi Friends,

How can we mitigate/stop session hijacking if the application is on HTTP
and MITM is already there?

Thanks Reuben for the reply.

The application allows multiple concurrent sessions.....Bad luck though :(

I tried hard but I found that its almost impossible to to mitigate session
hijacking if MITM is done.

Thanks again...

Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] Anti-CSRF token in cookie and post form
In-Reply-To: <CAGEo0NjMuV=O1h+0FtQb6zWm0XZM-8wvQXsKp9K1C2aH46mx9A@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies for not being clear at first place. I'll give it another shot :-)

The application has a Anti-CSRF token checking mechanism in which it is
just checking if the Anti-CSRF token sent in POST request is the same as
present in the cookie value being sent in the same POST request.

Now, since the application is not checking if the Anti-CSRF token presented
in the POST request is the same as what was set earlier, it is viewed as
vulnerable.

For creating a valid CSRF poc, I need to craft a POST request in which the
form has a Anti-CSRF token (may be '123') and I need to send the same
Anti-CSRF token in the cookie value.

Problem with creating this CSRF poc is, that HTML/JS code can not send
 cookies to the server due to the restriction in JavaScript (they are just
auto sent by browser itself).

Any way to create a working exploit?

You'd need to clarify a few things. With quite a few assumptions, here are a couple of options I can provide.?
If you've development bandwidth available, start encrypting end to end (assuming SSL is not an option).?
If as a user you are asking what can be done to mitigate such a threat, then the short answer is to setup a tunnel closer to the server, away from the MITM (assuming the MITM is not on the server) and then connect to the tunnel. The MITM will get encrypted content and won't know where the tunnel terminates. Alternatively, setup an instance on a public cloud and RDP/ssh into the instance and connect to the server from that instance.?

Hi Vaibhav,

In your case, you only need to match token A with token B in the same
request. Now I understand that you cannot control the token A value in the
cookie, but can control the token B value  in the post form.

Actually you need not control token A. You just need a mechanism to know
what is the value of token A that is currently being sent by the browser to
the server (assuming it is not per request, but per session or worse, valid
for a preset period of time). For this you'll require to be able to execute
Xss on the cookie (i.e., without httponly flag), predict or "fix" the
cookie value. Alternatively, assuming the "secure" flag is not set for this
particular cookie, it may be possible to make the user click on a http url
of the app(using social engineering) which will make the browser send
currently valid cookie values in clear text over the wire. At this point an
attacker who can sniff traffic can obtain the cookie. If your application
is already running on HTTP, then you need not bother with the above methods
since you have greater problems at hand than CSRF. :-)

Now, whether these things are possible in your scenario was not clear to me
from your description. Hope this helps.

Regards,
Reuben
Apologies for not being clear at first place. I'll give it another shot :-)

The application has a Anti-CSRF token checking mechanism in which it is
just checking if the Anti-CSRF token sent in POST request is the same as
present in the cookie value being sent in the same POST request.

Now, since the application is not checking if the Anti-CSRF token presented
in the POST request is the same as what was set earlier, it is viewed as
vulnerable.

For creating a valid CSRF poc, I need to craft a POST request in which the
form has a Anti-CSRF token (may be '123') and I need to send the same
Anti-CSRF token in the cookie value.

Problem with creating this CSRF poc is, that HTML/JS code can not send
 cookies to the server due to the restriction in JavaScript (they are just
auto sent by browser itself).

Any way to create a working exploit?

Not sure, if I could understand it fully. Have written quick code for
you to assess my understanding:

==poc.html==
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        document.cookie = "csrfToken=token123";

  <body onload="myFunction()">

Hi Vaibhav,
You cannot create or set or read cookie for another domain from your domaim.

So CSRF of this kind wouldn'tbe possible.
Not sure, if I could understand it fully. Have written quick code for
you to assess my understanding:

==poc.html==
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        document.cookie = "csrfToken=token123";

document.createElement('form').submit.call(document.getElementById('myForm'));
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body onload="myFunction()">
    <form id="myForm" name="myForm" action="http://localhost/poc.php"
method="POST">
      <input type=hidden name="username" id="username"
value="someusername"/>
      <input type=hidden name="csrfToken" id="val3" value="token123"/>
      <input type=hidden name="submit" id="submit" value="Continue"/>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

==poc.php==
<?php
  var_dump($_POST);
  var_dump($_COOKIE);
?>

Thats correct.

It can be done with a combination with some other vulnerability like
File upload, stored XSS, and not straight forward.

Well, not even that way, I was thinking something else, definitely
won't work in this way as well. Sorry for top-posting and confusion.

Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] OWASP Delhi on Slack (OWASP Global Chat)
Message-ID: <CAAvjMhP0J58HEz=DU5ks09N50PL1Uj94o_WfBcAduqG_cd2iTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Folks,

We have just created an #owasp-delhi channel on Slack.
Here is the channel link: https://owasp.slack.com/messages/chapter-delhi

In case you are not on slack, the registration URL is (requires email
only): https://owasp.herokuapp.com

We are using Slack as a global chat platform for OWASP. A lot like IRC, but
for most of us IRC ports are blocked in a corporate environment (i.e. at
work), so it's somewhat hard to collaborate during work hours. This works
over standard web ports - with a dedicated client app or via a web browser.
And, just in case you already use Slack, then you can just add another
account... It should make it a lot easier to collaborate.

You can join other OWASP channels as well such as #owasp-community and many
more

Feel free to reach out to me in case of any queries

_Sandeep
