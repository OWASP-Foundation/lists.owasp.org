Subject: [Owasp-leaders] OWASP Core Rule Set v3.0.0 (final) Released
To: owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org


Greetings fellow OWASP members,
It is with great excitement that I am able to share the culmination of a
project the Core Rule Set team has been developing for quite some time -
OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) Version 3.0.0 (stable). For those who are
unaware, the OWASP CRS is a set of generic rules designed to protect users
against threats like the OWASP Top 10
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project>. The rule
set is most often deployed in conjunction with an existing Web Application
Firewall like ModSecurity <https://modsecurity.org/>.
This latest version features many changes that help make CRS a valuable
part of a Defense in Depth strategy for protecting you web application.
Some these include:

   - Improved and More Precise Detection Coverage
   - Reduced False Positives and the Introduction of Paranoia Levels
   - Anomaly Scoring Mode by Default
   - Simplified User Experience
   - New Remote Code Execution Rules
   - Improved Layout, Documentation, and Testing

With this new release we are seeing on the order of 90-95% fewer false
positives in production environments. This is a large step that should make
CRS more accessible to the masses and we hope you all find it useful as
well.

To download a copy or to submit any issue, please visit our Github
<https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs> (https://github.
com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/releases/tag/v3.0.0). If you are
seeking additional information about the release, please check out this
accompanying blog post <http://goo.gl/f4uxlq>. The OWASP CRS team is truly
excited and pleased with this release, there are even rumors this new rule
set is being made into a movie <https://modsecurity.org/crs/poster>

Sincerely Chaim Sanders, on behalf of the Core Rules Set development team.

	Asia
Message-ID: <CAAvjMhNKEy039Nh03EKnrT_DV9krYT1Qy9Dn_R+9TPoHtweaQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

FYI.

This is a good opportunity in case you have something to present in the
area of DevSecOps.

thanks
Sandeep




Hi Everyone,


We are inviting speakers from Asia Pacific for DevSecCon Asia
<http://www.devseccon.com/asia-2017/>, taking place on the 23rd of February
2017 at Raffles City Convention Centre, Singapore. This one-day, two-track
conference will revolve around ways to implement DevSecOps ? a new approach
that thrives to embed security in development and business processes, a
topic on the cusp of changing IT culture as we know it.

Following the success of DevSecCon London, we are delighted to be heading
to Singapore for over 200 practitioners to come together and share insights
and experiences to help our attendees challenge the status quo in their
organisations and radically rethink their approach to secure development
and delivery.

If you have a story, experience, or new tools to share which centre on
continuously secure delivery, we?d love to hear from you. You can submit
your proposal here <http://www.devseccon.com/asia-2017/call-for-proposals/>.

We are looking for proposals in the following areas:

   - *Lightning talks* (10 mins): Talks describing DevSecOps, DevOps and
   Security experiences ? the good, the bad and the ugly.
   - *Practices* (25 mins): Talks focussed on applying DevSecOps and
   continuously secure delivery in an organisation.
   - *Organisational change* (25 mins): Talks dedicated to cultural changes
   and how to implement them.
   - *Technical workshops* (1 ? 2 hrs): DevSecOps workshop to help our
   attendees practice new tools/techniques.

The call for proposals will close on the 31st of December 2016.

If you have any questions please contact us at info-asia at devseccon.com.



Kind Regards,



DevSecCon Asia
