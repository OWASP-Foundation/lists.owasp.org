IMHO, there are two aspects attached:

1. Doing nothing but a publicity stunt - Much like Rakhi Sawant
2. Executing something and publicising the work

Sharing this particular instance with some international OWASP list would
have been surely injustice but sharing the work on an Indian OWASP list
should be digested as FYI...

Since when did this list become white-hat only list of prudes? For the record - i completely disagree with such criminal activities- but like any other hacker am interested in learning and sharing. You do recall some the early editions of phrack... Some of those articles were not exactly ethical nevertheless propogated innovative thinking. That's the non-judgemental attitude of uninhibhited exploration and sharing that made that forum the undisputed holy grail of hacker nirvana. So lets not judge but learn (or as Dhruv suggests, probably take it as fyi if nothing else.)
Cheers,

IMHO, there are two aspects attached:

1. Doing nothing but a publicity stunt - Much like Rakhi Sawant
2. Executing something and publicising the work

Sharing this particular instance with some international OWASP list would
have been surely injustice but sharing the work on an Indian OWASP list
should be digested as FYI...

May be a publicity stunt of ICA... Last year some group called ICW
also did same thing, are this new guys copying the same protocol.  :)

Buddy...Learning & sharing is very much appreciated if they would be
interested in sharing their actual work :) but on an international forum two
countries interpersonal relations should not come into picture.

Rest, Being an Indian, I'm proud of this. :))

Cheers!

Guys, i was just going through the posts, lets not make conclussions,
its the begining of cyber war, you you never know if this is intended
and proffessional people doing, who loves their country. What ever is
the case, it has some purpose, and anyway everything is fair in war,
atleast its a passive war. And there is no logical explaination to
this act, so just chill, if they hacked them, we also get hacked every
now and then, that time also we argue, that why us?
So lets not decide about good or bad, just chill.

All,

Too much said, its time to stop bugging about it. Whether through this list or any other source you would have gotten this info anyway. So take it as an information and treat it in a healthy and positive way.

Guys, i was just going through the posts, lets not make conclussions,
its the begining of cyber war, you you never know if this is intended
and proffessional people doing, who loves their country. What ever is
the case, it has some purpose, and anyway everything is fair in war,
atleast its a passive war. And there is no logical explaination to
this act, so just chill, if they hacked them, we also get hacked every
now and then, that time also we argue, that why us?
So lets not decide about good or bad, just chill.

Also just see what happening with Indian websites.
if we just check the no of yesterday's defaced .in domain webisites on
Zone-H than the number comes as :
Total notifications: *548* of which *16* single ip and *532* mass
defacements

check the mirror of one .in domain defaced site here:
https://www.zone-h.org/mirror/id/12342225

here my point is not showing that Indian websites getting defaced so Indian
hacker should do the same but the point is that web servers are not securely
configured.

If NIC was a hosting company they wouldn't be getting any business for
managed services for their legendary incompetence, do they have an SLA to
restore stuff in finite time, I mean the napakis hosted their websites in US
so understable they were fiddling with ftp to upload stuff from their
blazing fast cheaper than India DSL lines, but what sort of 'enterprise'
tape drive backups do these folks at NIC use that they can't restore a
static website no more than a few megabytes for so long.

Shit happens all the time its the MTTR that matters more.

India seems to have its fill of incompetent bureaucrats like the ones at
CERT-IN  ( where some sweater knitting ladies pick up the official phone
mentioned on their website with responses like CERT-IN woh kya hai type
answers when you call them up to verify their PGP key fingerprint as
recommended on their website )

If you read the article just shared by me, it mentions that CBI website had SQL injection on their website so can?t be restored without programming changes. I also underwent another article on Indian National Cyber Security policy which literally made me go into laughter, its available here: http://www.hackerregiment.com/indias-national-cyber-security-policy-or-corporate-information-security-policy.html

Your statement makes me worried at multiple levels.

1. Does nobody do website scanning for user input verification before they
make it live ? I think apart from the contact form there was hardly any
user-input in the whole website ? Close out the user-input related pages and
SQL injection issues go away for a while, the rest of the website can be
back.

2. Why don't they rely on robust open source like wordpress/drupal for
simple content based sites which anyway don't have any useful information.
Atleast the patches get released regularly and can be easily applied.
Ofcourse if they contract out theme building the likelihood is the 90's
style themes would have vulnerabilities built into it by newbies who code
it, there a few things that don't work well with a tendering process and
building web applications is one of them. Otherwise its monstrosities like
the MCA21 website is what it results in at a huge cost to the taxpayers.

3. What prevents them from putting up a static page that website is being
restored instead of just doing a disappearing act.

4. This is not the first time it has happened to NIC, how many heads have
rolled till now.

5. The below mentioned link makes for a real sad reading, its not hard for a
big spender like Government to hire a few ex-Google,ex-Yahoo! , ex-Amazon
folks in India these days to fix web security from the ground up.

I think they have a rule which says public CMS like drupal/wp/joomla cannot be
installed in NIC servers.
Heard this many a times from many deptartments who wanted a readymade CMS for
their sites

Tarun, absolutely right!
It has been almost 24 hrs and still "Problem Loading Page" when you try to
access cbi.nic.in !!!
It's still down...whatever happened is happened but if restoring takes such
a long time...then really it's a pity!

Guys,
Apologies however i beg to differ a bit here. we should also understand NIC's constraints. They do scan sites for vulnerabilities, however with limited budget, so that does hurt a bit. I'd still say that it's not completely NIC's fault. If respective application focals dont fix things on their end even after seeing high risk issues whom to blame?

Govt officials can't really push (ideally they should have the power, however I doubt if they are delegated that much authority)

Again consider the case of shared servers which have poor config because some legacy application running on it needs FTP/telent! Sucks.... But these are practical challenges! You can't force the business to go down because of these hiccups. If you push them harder, believe me you'll find a tough time justifying your actions. 

End result weak server configurations, unpatched and wide open apps invite people to hack in!

Now that something like this is witnessed, I am hoping that folks at NIC can use this as an opportunity to push respective app focal's and tighten their security. It's only when brand is tarnished that people take things seriously! 

Hope things change soon.... Fingers crossed!

Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod,

Thanks,
Chintan

I don't deny that, was just mentioning the constraints of govt agencies. Hope folks at NIC take this as an opportunity to do some house cleaning here

Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod,

Since, we pursued few govt. projects available via biddings to public tenders so I would comment in a complete business centric approach here:

 

Most of such tenders are already fixed before going out to the public and most of the times, those are prepared by the company, which ultimately wins at the end. Such are biased tenders with the conditions which can only be fulfilled only by the company who has prepared it and other capable companies get automatically rejected from the bidding process.

 

Providing such favours to the company gives personal benefits to the person at govt. department who is responsible to look after the project. I am certainly not trying to comment, nor I am aware of how the CBI website security audit work was provided to the auditor and whether it involved fixing or not. But it is strange to know that the company which conducted the audit for CBI website could not find a simple SQL injection, even it would have been under limited budgets.

 

Just to give away an example: Last week, we met a govt. dept. who wished to outsource auditing work worth 10L and we were surprised to know that they kept the condition for the qualification for the bidders who have turnover of above 40Crs. which makes absolutely no sense and clearly indicates a biasness.  

 

Apart from setting up other standards and including empanelment process for the auditors, I think CERT-IN also needs to ensure that for critical work like InfoSec such qualification criteria should fall under some pre-defined standards else there would be biased tenders involving corruption, leading to worthless audit and resulting into shame for the country.

Guys,

Apologies however i beg to differ a bit here. we should also understand NIC's constraints. They do scan sites for vulnerabilities, however with limited budget, so that does hurt a bit. I'd still say that it's not completely NIC's fault. If respective application focals dont fix things on their end even after seeing high risk issues whom to blame?

 

Govt officials can't really push (ideally they should have the power, however I doubt if they are delegated that much authority)

 

Again consider the case of shared servers which have poor config because some legacy application running on it needs FTP/telent! Sucks.... But these are practical challenges! You can't force the business to go down because of these hiccups. If you push them harder, believe me you'll find a tough time justifying your actions. 

 

End result weak server configurations, unpatched and wide open apps invite people to hack in!

 

Now that something like this is witnessed, I am hoping that folks at NIC can use this as an opportunity to push respective app focal's and tighten their security. It's only when brand is tarnished that people take things seriously! 

 

Hope things change soon.... Fingers crossed!


Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod,

 

Thanks,

Chintan

Your statement makes me worried at multiple levels. 

1. Does nobody do website scanning for user input verification before they make it live ? I think apart from the contact form there was hardly any user-input in the whole website ? Close out the user-input related pages and SQL injection issues go away for a while, the rest of the website can be back.

2. Why don't they rely on robust open source like wordpress/drupal for simple content based sites which anyway don't have any useful information. Atleast the patches get released regularly and can be easily applied. Ofcourse if they contract out theme building the likelihood is the 90's style themes would have vulnerabilities built into it by newbies who code it, there a few things that don't work well with a tendering process and building web applications is one of them. Otherwise its monstrosities like the MCA21 website is what it results in at a huge cost to the taxpayers. 

3. What prevents them from putting up a static page that website is being restored instead of just doing a disappearing act.

4. This is not the first time it has happened to NIC, how many heads have rolled till now.

5. The below mentioned link makes for a real sad reading, its not hard for a big spender like Government to hire a few ex-Google,ex-Yahoo! , ex-Amazon folks in India these days to fix web security from the ground up.

If NIC was a hosting company they wouldn't be getting any business for managed services for their legendary incompetence, do they have an SLA to restore stuff in finite time, I mean the napakis hosted their websites in US so understable they were fiddling with ftp to upload stuff from their blazing fast cheaper than India DSL lines, but what sort of 'enterprise' tape drive backups do these folks at NIC use that they can't restore a static website no more than a few megabytes for so long.

Shit happens all the time its the MTTR that matters more. 

India seems to have its fill of incompetent bureaucrats like the ones at CERT-IN  ( where some sweater knitting ladies pick up the official phone mentioned on their website with responses like CERT-IN woh kya hai type answers when you call them up to verify their PGP key fingerprint as recommended on their website )

I have heard this before. More often than not its the large vendors who do
not directly bid, but help establish a tender criteria in which they would
benefit regardless of the implementer.

Message-ID: <229879.49617.qm@web120514.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Let's take a couple of steps back and start looking at things from a slightly 
elevated (pun intended) perspective.

1. Website defacement need not be taken at an emotional level - I'd encourage 
all of you to do some introspection and ponder that do words like "shame for the 
country" have place in a security analyst's vocabulary? For argument's sake 
let's say it does - but does it really apply to "website defacement", which is 
one of the lamest acts of publicity mongering - all hyped up in today's 
ignorant, publicity scavenging, news hungry environment. 
In the physical world, what would you do to graffiti on a building - you'd wait 
till the cleaner comes back on Monday and get the chance to clean it up. You 
don't have the CEO spending sleepless nights over it - unless of course he's the 
cleaner himself. I was going through the CISA and CISSP body of knowledge and 
trying to locate the disaster planning/mitigation one should undertake for 
graffiti.

2.  FWIW, most of these websites are static and host only some public documents 
and html marquee tags - which is how they should be ;) If there's nothing 
worthwhile, then wasn't the entire exercise in futility? 

3. The concept of "if you graffiti my wall - i will graffiti your wall" (what 
all these nags and sheshnags and kyabakis are upto) has an entertainment value 
but beyond that does it really deserve the time and bandwidth we are consuming 
in discussing it. Of course, systems can be hardened and services like pingdom 
etc. can be utilized, but that's utopia :)

4. Addressing the point about (turnover of above 40Crs) - for many organizations 
who are new to a process (in this case security review)  it is a safety 
mechanism to put in vendor size. That is one way of mitigating risks, both from 
a process as well as ability to handle legal liability point of view. Also, a 
larger org can rally resources much faster by throwing money at the problem than 
a small 10-20 member shop who will be asking for advance even before the project 
begins. So, it may not always be favoritism - it is simply an act of CYA. 
Credibility helps for small vendors but when faced with people whose jobs are on 
the line - they'd rather vote for their job security than application security 
;)

5. Another argument I read was about using popular consumer CMS like 
wordpress/drupal etc. One of my wordpress sites (duly updated, security scanned 
etc.) was susceptible to a mass defacement attack about a few weeks back using 
vulnerability in the blog post editor component (the web still has wrong 
information on how to fix the issue). My point being: using a popular cms is not 
going to fix the problem. 

6. Ah! the age old logic: ex-popular company developer can fix it. The knight in 
shining armour! Absolute load of whatever. Working at any of the top software 
companies IS NOT same as being a good security analyst. Most of the developers 
world over (including folks at companies you mentioned) don't know about secure 
coding. Show me one good coder with a firm grasp of security and I can show you 
millions without! Most guys in the interviews start waxing eloquent about SQL 
injection and tell me about their favorite tools go numb when asked about out of 
band channeling. Just like any other field, software is teeming with folks who 
are in it for the money - which doesn't guarantee depth of knowledge! In fact, 
being good at C (which most of these shops prefer) is inversely proportional to 
their security quotient.

Just let these defacements be line items in your daily news. Don't ponder too 
much over it - there are much deeper issues to solve. It is like giving prime 
importance to a pimple because it is on your face (which is not quite pretty to 
begin with :p ), when your innards are actually decaying.

For each defacement that is reported, I wonder how many compromised servers 
running botnets waging a proxy war against your own servers from your own soil 
are going unnoticed. (had to put that in - what's an email without some 
sensationalism, correct?)

Enjoy your Sunday - and remember the wise always said, attachment of any kind 
(in life or in email) is not good for you.
Vinil

I have heard this before. More often than not its the large vendors who do not 
directly bid, but help establish a tender criteria in which they would benefit 
regardless of the implementer.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikWYRXYtLJD+HAiOSoOUCW_JbXg58FDafD+qxhN@mail.gmail.com>

Just wanted to inquire on this occasion - Are the following possible within
the current scope of this chapter -

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Working_Session_-_OWASP_Intra_Governmental_Affairs
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Working_Session_-_OWASP_Intra_Governmental_Affairs>
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Protecting_Federal_Government_from_Web_2.0_Application_Security_Risks

<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Protecting_Federal_Government_from_Web_2.0_Application_Security_Risks>We
could definitely conduct similar meetings / conferences with the Government
officials often explaining the risks in the current set-up and processes.
Wanted to ask if there is any plan related to this from our OWASP chapter
perspective.

One more thing - if we think that this "lack of sufficient security
controls" stops at Government machinery in India, we are absolutely wrong.
Do you know how easy it is to hack hotel networks in India and view the
credit card info; how easy it is to perform social engineering attacks in
India; and how easily we fall traps to internet based worms / viruses. My
idea is just by security fencing the government based infrastructure would
not help. The security consciousness should come within in the people
related to IT industry in the entire country.

On this front - I am not sure if I am throwing darts; I have not seen such a
complete implementation across - But what we need is a complete portal which
caters to the questions people might put forth related to the security. The
idea is to create security awareness among people through a portal which
acts as a advisory to the current internet threat scenarios - localized to
our country. Tech big wiggy companies need to endorse the site and provide
their own recommendations for implementing security controls specific to
current threats (e.g. prevailing worms, viruses). A forum / helpline could
also be placed wherein people could approach for inquires related to the
security. Finally and more importantly the site needs to be marketed well to
take it to the masses.

Our country's IT infrastructure needs a major overhaul wrt the security.

regards
Phani

Not sure what others on the list feel, but sorry to state that I completely disagree with your points. Hope nothing goes personal here but will try to share my thought process.

 

1.       This billion people country doesn?t follow security analyst?s vocabulary, or do they? When I used the word like ?shame for the country?, I didn?t count in few 1000s of security experts like you and me who understand the meaning of ?website defacement?. Be it aimed international publicity or intentionally hyped story, for a common man of the country this instance means ?Hacking? Be it cleaner or the sweeper, who is awaited for Monday, no one is bothered about. Question ends at who is accountable? Builder, Designer, Painter, Survey team, or the Security Guard who is responsible to ensure the security of the building. Or one should keep waiting for a new Monday every time?

 

2.       Be it html marquee tags,  bold or italic tags, first principle of information security ?CIA? is self-explanatory. If something is unavailable due to lame or sophisticated cyber attack, be it CISA/CISM/CISSP, it is called as security breach, and there comes the rapid incidence response before thinking on mitigation. ?Reputational Loss? is much higher than ?Financial Loss? and Defacement is enough to make that loss. Yeah, it is lamest act of publicity but we have to accept it. 

 

3.       As you said, Turnover requirement is to mitigate the risk. Do you think a company with turnover of over 3Cr. would declare bankruptcy for a small project of 10L? Why do we need a company with 40Crs.? The point I tried to make was, qualification criteria for the tenders should be pre-defined rather putting that in ad-hoc manner into the tenders. Ideally, turnover of 10 times of total project value should ensures execution of the project by mitigating risks, it could be 20 times or 30 times, law makers are the best judge to decide, but again it should be defined somewhere on the records so that it doesn?t open doors for corruption. For a project requirement that raises the need for just 2-3 InfoSec resources, do we really care for a larger organization that can rally the resources faster?  Today?s every large enterprise started with a small 10-20 member shop few years back, be it Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or IBM. Secondly, SMB is the largest segment in India and by making such ridiculous qualification conditions, govt. is only going to increase the monopoly of larger organization, discouraging innovation and degrading quality of services. Healthy qualification criteria invites more bidders, improves competition and increases quality of services.

 

4.       A matured CMS product and that too community driven is much secured than trying to develop own CMS. Think about writing own operating system rather using a matured and community driven like Debian?? Money should actually be spent in hardening the CMS with in-depth security code review of core engine with approved plugins, followed by pen-test exercise to make it a standard hardened CMS product for the all the govt. websites, much like OpenBSD in OS category. It could save tax payers? hard earned money being spoiled by the government on reiterating the web-development, security testing process of every website out of those 1000s of government websites those still carry tons of vulnerabilities.

 

5.       Tarun mentioned to hire ex-Google, ex-Yahoo, I am sure he didn?t mean (@Tarun, correct me if I am wrong) to hire developers from those companies, rather he pointed to hire the top leadership who can lead the entire show with accountability and well defined quality gates. Just like Nandan Nilekani from InfoSys is now the Chairman for UIDAI.

 

6.       Defacement of a flowershop?s website doesn?t bother anyone, but defacement of prime websites make a big difference. Just like a bomb blast in some slum area killing 100s didn?t bother much, but few gun fires at Hotel Taj/Trident created war like conditions. Pimple on the face principle is as good as , ?Asset Identification and Valuation? principle in Risk Assessment which can be located in CISSP/CISA 

 

Thank god it was Sunday and I could share my opinion in detail J

Let's take a couple of steps back and start looking at things from a slightly elevated (pun intended) perspective.

 

1. Website defacement need not be taken at an emotional level - I'd encourage all of you to do some introspection and ponder that do words like "shame for the country" have place in a security analyst's vocabulary? For argument's sake let's say it does - but does it really apply to "website defacement", which is one of the lamest acts of publicity mongering - all hyped up in today's ignorant, publicity scavenging, news hungry environment. 

In the physical world, what would you do to graffiti on a building - you'd wait till the cleaner comes back on Monday and get the chance to clean it up. You don't have the CEO spending sleepless nights over it - unless of course he's the cleaner himself. I was going through the CISA and CISSP body of knowledge and trying to locate the disaster planning/mitigation one should undertake for graffiti.

 

2.  FWIW, most of these websites are static and host only some public documents and html marquee tags - which is how they should be ;) If there's nothing worthwhile, then wasn't the entire exercise in futility? 

 

3. The concept of "if you graffiti my wall - i will graffiti your wall" (what all these nags and sheshnags and kyabakis are upto) has an entertainment value but beyond that does it really deserve the time and bandwidth we are consuming in discussing it. Of course, systems can be hardened and services like pingdom etc. can be utilized, but that's utopia :)

 

4. Addressing the point about (turnover of above 40Crs) - for many organizations who are new to a process (in this case security review)  it is a safety mechanism to put in vendor size. That is one way of mitigating risks, both from a process as well as ability to handle legal liability point of view. Also, a larger org can rally resources much faster by throwing money at the problem than a small 10-20 member shop who will be asking for advance even before the project begins. So, it may not always be favoritism - it is simply an act of CYA. Credibility helps for small vendors but when faced with people whose jobs are on the line - they'd rather vote for their job security than application security ;)

 

5. Another argument I read was about using popular consumer CMS like wordpress/drupal etc. One of my wordpress sites (duly updated, security scanned etc.) was susceptible to a mass defacement attack about a few weeks back using vulnerability in the blog post editor component (the web still has wrong information on how to fix the issue). My point being: using a popular cms is not going to fix the problem. 

 

6. Ah! the age old logic: ex-popular company developer can fix it. The knight in shining armour! Absolute load of whatever. Working at any of the top software companies IS NOT same as being a good security analyst. Most of the developers world over (including folks at companies you mentioned) don't know about secure coding. Show me one good coder with a firm grasp of security and I can show you millions without! Most guys in the interviews start waxing eloquent about SQL injection and tell me about their favorite tools go numb when asked about out of band channeling. Just like any other field, software is teeming with folks who are in it for the money - which doesn't guarantee depth of knowledge! In fact, being good at C (which most of these shops prefer) is inversely proportional to their security quotient.

 

Just let these defacements be line items in your daily news. Don't ponder too much over it - there are much deeper issues to solve. It is like giving prime importance to a pimple because it is on your face (which is not quite pretty to begin with :p ), when your innards are actually decaying.


For each defacement that is reported, I wonder how many compromised servers running botnets waging a proxy war against your own servers from your own soil are going unnoticed. (had to put that in - what's an email without some sensationalism, correct?)

 

Enjoy your Sunday - and remember the wise always said, attachment of any kind (in life or in email) is not good for you.

Vinil

I have heard this before. More often than not its the large vendors who do not directly bid, but help establish a tender criteria in which they would benefit regardless of the implementer.

Since, we pursued few govt. projects available via biddings to public tenders so I would comment in a complete business centric approach here:

 

Most of such tenders are already fixed before going out to the public and most of the times, those are prepared by the company, which ultimately wins at the end. Such are biased tenders with the conditions which can only be fulfilled only by the company who has prepared it and other capable companies get automatically rejected from the bidding process.

 

Providing such favours to the company gives personal benefits to the person at govt. department who is responsible to look after the project. I am certainly not trying to comment, nor I am aware of how the CBI website security audit work was provided to the auditor and whether it involved fixing or not. But it is strange to know that the company which conducted the audit for CBI website could not find a simple SQL injection, even it would have been under limited budgets.

 

Just to give away an example: Last week, we met a govt. dept. who wished to outsource auditing work worth 10L and we were surprised to know that they kept the condition for the qualification for the bidders who have turnover of above 40Crs. which makes absolutely no sense and clearly indicates a biasness.  

 

Apart from setting up other standards and including empanelment process for the auditors, I think CERT-IN also needs to ensure that for critical work like InfoSec such qualification criteria should fall under some pre-defined standards else there would be biased tenders involving corruption, leading to worthless audit and resulting into shame for the country.

Guys,

Apologies however i beg to differ a bit here. we should also understand NIC's constraints. They do scan sites for vulnerabilities, however with limited budget, so that does hurt a bit. I'd still say that it's not completely NIC's fault. If respective application focals dont fix things on their end even after seeing high risk issues whom to blame?

 

Govt officials can't really push (ideally they should have the power, however I doubt if they are delegated that much authority)

 

Again consider the case of shared servers which have poor config because some legacy application running on it needs FTP/telent! Sucks.... But these are practical challenges! You can't force the business to go down because of these hiccups. If you push them harder, believe me you'll find a tough time justifying your actions. 

 

End result weak server configurations, unpatched and wide open apps invite people to hack in!

 

Now that something like this is witnessed, I am hoping that folks at NIC can use this as an opportunity to push respective app focal's and tighten their security. It's only when brand is tarnished that people take things seriously! 

 

Hope things change soon.... Fingers crossed!


Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod,

 

Thanks,

Chintan

Your statement makes me worried at multiple levels. 

1. Does nobody do website scanning for user input verification before they make it live ? I think apart from the contact form there was hardly any user-input in the whole website ? Close out the user-input related pages and SQL injection issues go away for a while, the rest of the website can be back.

2. Why don't they rely on robust open source like wordpress/drupal for simple content based sites which anyway don't have any useful information. Atleast the patches get released regularly and can be easily applied. Ofcourse if they contract out theme building the likelihood is the 90's style themes would have vulnerabilities built into it by newbies who code it, there a few things that don't work well with a tendering process and building web applications is one of them. Otherwise its monstrosities like the MCA21 website is what it results in at a huge cost to the taxpayers. 

3. What prevents them from putting up a static page that website is being restored instead of just doing a disappearing act.

4. This is not the first time it has happened to NIC, how many heads have rolled till now.

5. The below mentioned link makes for a real sad reading, its not hard for a big spender like Government to hire a few ex-Google,ex-Yahoo! , ex-Amazon folks in India these days to fix web security from the ground up.

If you read the article just shared by me, it mentions that CBI website had SQL injection on their website so can?t be restored without programming changes.

If NIC was a hosting company they wouldn't be getting any business for managed services for their legendary incompetence, do they have an SLA to restore stuff in finite time, I mean the napakis hosted their websites in US so understable they were fiddling with ftp to upload stuff from their blazing fast cheaper than India DSL lines, but what sort of 'enterprise' tape drive backups do these folks at NIC use that they can't restore a static website no more than a few megabytes for so long.

Shit happens all the time its the MTTR that matters more. 

India seems to have its fill of incompetent bureaucrats like the ones at CERT-IN  ( where some sweater knitting ladies pick up the official phone mentioned on their website with responses like CERT-IN woh kya hai type answers when you call them up to verify their PGP key fingerprint as recommended on their website )

I was merely pointing out the fact that there a large number of engineers
who work on keeping servers reasonably secure and low MTTR where nobody
wakes up in the morning to see some script kiddies having replaced the
frontpage and it should be possible for the government ot hire such folks.

Analogies are a really bad way to make a point. No two situations are really

Vinil, you are correct at saying that website defacement is not much and is often the work of the lowest in the food chain . But that insight is available to the knowledgeable few. To the rest of the masses whose staple diet is the TV and tabloid journalism, the very fact that CBI's website has been hacked is 'big' news and a 'matter of national shame' (especially if the credit goes to the Pakis). 

Of course some of us are laughing at the report of CBI lodging a case (with itself?) over this defacement.

Another argument I read was about using popular consumer CMS like wordpress/drupal etc. One of my wordpress sites (duly updated, security scanned etc.) was susceptible to a mass defacement attack about a few weeks back using vulnerability in the blog post editor component (the web still has wrong information on how to fix the issue). My point being: using a popular cms is not going to fix the problem. 


6. Ah! the age old logic: ex-popular company developer can fix it. The knight in shining armour! Absolute load of whatever. Working at any of the top software companies IS NOT same as being a good security analyst. Most of the developers world over (including folks at companies you mentioned) don't know about secure coding. Show me one good coder with a firm grasp of security and I can show you millions without! Most guys in the interviews start waxing eloquent about SQL injection and tell me about their favorite tools go numb when asked about out of band channeling. Just like any other field, software is teeming with folks who are in it for the money - which doesn't guarantee depth of knowledge! In fact, being good at C (which most of these shops prefer) is inversely proportional to their security quotient. 


Just let these defacements be line items in your daily news. Don't ponder too much over it - there are much deeper issues to solve. It is like giving prime importance to a pimple because it is on your face (which is not quite pretty to begin with :p ), when your innards are actually decaying. 

For each defacement that is reported, I wonder how many compromised servers running botnets waging a proxy war against your own servers from your own soil are going unnoticed. (had to put that in - what's an email without some sensationalism, correct?) 


Enjoy your Sunday - and remember the wise always said, attachment of any kind (in life or in email) is not good for you.

I have heard this before. More often than not its the large vendors who do not directly bid, but help establish a tender criteria in which they would benefit regardless of the implementer.

Guys, 


Apologies however i beg to differ a bit here. we should also understand NIC's constraints. They do scan sites for vulnerabilities, however with limited budget, so that does hurt a bit. I'd still say that it's not completely NIC's fault. If respective application focals dont fix things on their end even after seeing high risk issues whom to blame? 






Govt officials can't really push (ideally they should have the power, however I doubt if they are delegated that much authority) 





Again consider the case of shared servers which have poor config because some legacy application running on it needs FTP/telent! Sucks.... But these are practical challenges! You can't force the business to go down because of these hiccups. If you push them harder, believe me you'll find a tough time justifying your actions. 






End result weak server configurations, unpatched and wide open apps invite people to hack in! 






Now that something like this is witnessed, I am hoping that folks at NIC can use this as an opportunity to push respective app focal's and tighten their security. It's only when brand is tarnished that people take things seriously! 






Hope things change soon.... Fingers crossed! 



Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod,

If NIC was a hosting company they wouldn't be getting any business for managed services for their legendary incompetence, do they have an SLA to restore stuff in finite time, I mean the napakis hosted their websites in US so understable they were fiddling with ftp to upload stuff from their blazing fast cheaper than India DSL lines, but what sort of 'enterprise' tape drive backups do these folks at NIC use that they can't restore a static website no more than a few megabytes for so long. 

Shit happens all the time its the MTTR that matters more. 

India seems to have its fill of incompetent bureaucrats like the ones at CERT-IN ( where some sweater knitting ladies pick up the official phone mentioned on their website with responses like CERT-IN woh kya hai type answers when you call them up to verify their PGP key fingerprint as recommended on their website )

 I completely agree with Vinil here. We are just wasting our time defacing
the websites.

Wesite defacement is the most simplest of all hacking stuff. By this
defacement what have we acieved?

0. Was any confidential/secret documents taken?
1. Is this stopping the activity of the owner of the site and making them
incurr a serious business/economic loss?
2. Does this defacement/vulnerabilty injection really compormise any of the
other sensitive data?
3. What is the effetive loss due to this defacement? Peanuts, is what I
would say.
4. Hacking an enemy site that is not even worth INR 0.0001 paisa is more
like hitting a lame guy who does not even have the strength to hit back. I
am not meaning the Pakistani govt or the Indian govt here. I am speaking
about the other so called 800 sites defaced by the ICA and the 200+ sites
defaced by the pakistanis.
5. This is more of a cowardly act because the sites that we have attacked
mean nothing to us in  most cases.
6. Had we entered in to actual cyber war (a la-Assagne tyoe), that wud have
made the opponent side proud (and equally shaeful for the owner) because
that wud have resulted in a dent in the pride of the opponent. (Please not
that I am not trying to support the Pakistanis here. I am just trying to
look at this from an independent analyser).
7. Why are we having such a big thread for this insignificant issue?
8. I have noticed that no other thread has so many folloups. Is it because
of our natural anethema towartds Paksitanis? Any anti-paki stand by an
Indian raises our flare so much. Dont you this we are wastng our energies
too much on thiese wheil we can do a lot more ot make it better for all?
(Both foir Pakistanis & for Indians?)
9. Dont you think that this list would have benifitted had we discussed
vulnarabilites instad of something like this?
a. After all what is Pakistan ot India, for that matter? It was an integral
prat of India and is just annother land given by nature. It is only man who
has divided and marked the boundaries. Let us leave warfar to our Army
bretheren and let the civilians from both these great countries hold out
their hands to each other and connect better. This will make the world a
better place to live in.


Dear OWASPers, lets not waste our time on these trivial matters, Instead let
us concentrate on the real security issues.

Thanks & Regards,
~Venki

 Annother thing Jack et al,

OWASP is never into hacking other sites and will NEVER support such an
activity at any point in time. OWASP is more involved in PROTECTING every
site and making the devlopers of these sites more awartte of security and
making hits a default execution thread in their development process rather
than having security as an exception flow. So, jack et al., please stop
eulogizing yourself and try to do something more beneficial to the community
and to OWASP.

Thanks & Regards,
~Venki

Annother thing Jack et al,

 

OWASP is never into hacking other sites and will NEVER support such an
activity at any point in time. OWASP is more involved in PROTECTING every
site and making the devlopers of these sites more awartte of security and
making hits a default execution thread in their development process rather
than having security as an exception flow. So, jack et al., please stop
eulogizing yourself and try to do something more beneficial to the community
and to OWASP.

I completely agree with Vinil here. We are just wasting our time defacing
the websites.

 

Wesite defacement is the most simplest of all hacking stuff. By this
defacement what have we acieved?

 

0. Was any confidential/secret documents taken?

1. Is this stopping the activity of the owner of the site and making them
incurr a serious business/economic loss?

2. Does this defacement/vulnerabilty injection really compormise any of the
other sensitive data?

3. What is the effetive loss due to this defacement? Peanuts, is what I
would say.

4. Hacking an enemy site that is not even worth INR 0.0001 paisa is more
like hitting a lame guy who does not even have the strength to hit back. I
am not meaning the Pakistani govt or the Indian govt here. I am speaking
about the other so called 800 sites defaced by the ICA and the 200+ sites
defaced by the pakistanis.

5. This is more of a cowardly act because the sites that we have attacked
mean nothing to us in  most cases.

6. Had we entered in to actual cyber war (a la-Assagne tyoe), that wud have
made the opponent side proud (and equally shaeful for the owner) because
that wud have resulted in a dent in the pride of the opponent. (Please not
that I am not trying to support the Pakistanis here. I am just trying to
look at this from an independent analyser).

7. Why are we having such a big thread for this insignificant issue?

8. I have noticed that no other thread has so many folloups. Is it because
of our natural anethema towartds Paksitanis? Any anti-paki stand by an
Indian raises our flare so much. Dont you this we are wastng our energies
too much on thiese wheil we can do a lot more ot make it better for all?
(Both foir Pakistanis & for Indians?)

9. Dont you think that this list would have benifitted had we discussed
vulnarabilites instad of something like this?

a. After all what is Pakistan ot India, for that matter? It was an integral
prat of India and is just annother land given by nature. It is only man who
has divided and marked the boundaries. Let us leave warfar to our Army
bretheren and let the civilians from both these great countries hold out
their hands to each other and connect better. This will make the world a
better place to live in.

 


Dear OWASPers, lets not waste our time on these trivial matters, Instead let
us concentrate on the real security issues.

Let's take a couple of steps back and start looking at things from a
slightly elevated (pun intended) perspective.

 

1. Website defacement need not be taken at an emotional level - I'd
encourage all of you to do some introspection and ponder that do words like
"shame for the country" have place in a security analyst's vocabulary? For
argument's sake let's say it does - but does it really apply to "website
defacement", which is one of the lamest acts of publicity mongering - all
hyped up in today's ignorant, publicity scavenging, news hungry environment.


In the physical world, what would you do to graffiti on a building - you'd
wait till the cleaner comes back on Monday and get the chance to clean it
up. You don't have the CEO spending sleepless nights over it - unless of
course he's the cleaner himself. I was going through the CISA and CISSP body
of knowledge and trying to locate the disaster planning/mitigation one
should undertake for graffiti.

 

2.  FWIW, most of these websites are static and host only some public
documents and html marquee tags - which is how they should be ;) If there's
nothing worthwhile, then wasn't the entire exercise in futility? 

 

3. The concept of "if you graffiti my wall - i will graffiti your wall"
(what all these nags and sheshnags and kyabakis are upto) has an
entertainment value but beyond that does it really deserve the time and
bandwidth we are consuming in discussing it. Of course, systems can be
hardened and services like pingdom etc. can be utilized, but that's utopia
:)

 

4. Addressing the point about (turnover of above 40Crs) - for many
organizations who are new to a process (in this case security review)  it is
a safety mechanism to put in vendor size. That is one way of mitigating
risks, both from a process as well as ability to handle legal liability
point of view. Also, a larger org can rally resources much faster by
throwing money at the problem than a small 10-20 member shop who will be
asking for advance even before the project begins. So, it may not always be
favoritism - it is simply an act of CYA. Credibility helps for small vendors
but when faced with people whose jobs are on the line - they'd rather vote
for their job security than application security ;)

 

5. Another argument I read was about using popular consumer CMS like
wordpress/drupal etc. One of my wordpress sites (duly updated, security
scanned etc.) was susceptible to a mass defacement attack about a few weeks
back using vulnerability in the blog post editor component (the web still
has wrong information on how to fix the issue). My point being: using a
popular cms is not going to fix the problem. 

 

6. Ah! the age old logic: ex-popular company developer can fix it. The
knight in shining armour! Absolute load of whatever. Working at any of the
top software companies IS NOT same as being a good security analyst. Most of
the developers world over (including folks at companies you mentioned) don't
know about secure coding. Show me one good coder with a firm grasp of
security and I can show you millions without! Most guys in the interviews
start waxing eloquent about SQL injection and tell me about their favorite
tools go numb when asked about out of band channeling. Just like any other
field, software is teeming with folks who are in it for the money - which
doesn't guarantee depth of knowledge! In fact, being good at C (which most
of these shops prefer) is inversely proportional to their security quotient.

 

Just let these defacements be line items in your daily news. Don't ponder
too much over it - there are much deeper issues to solve. It is like giving
prime importance to a pimple because it is on your face (which is not quite
pretty to begin with :p ), when your innards are actually decaying.


For each defacement that is reported, I wonder how many compromised servers
running botnets waging a proxy war against your own servers from your own
soil are going unnoticed. (had to put that in - what's an email without some
sensationalism, correct?)

 

Enjoy your Sunday - and remember the wise always said, attachment of any
kind (in life or in email) is not good for you.

Vinil

I have heard this before. More often than not its the large vendors who do
not directly bid, but help establish a tender criteria in which they would
benefit regardless of the implementer.

Since, we pursued few govt. projects available via biddings to public
tenders so I would comment in a complete business centric approach here:

 

Most of such tenders are already fixed before going out to the public and
most of the times, those are prepared by the company, which ultimately wins
at the end. Such are biased tenders with the conditions which can only be
fulfilled only by the company who has prepared it and other capable
companies get automatically rejected from the bidding process.

 

Providing such favours to the company gives personal benefits to the person
at govt. department who is responsible to look after the project. I am
certainly not trying to comment, nor I am aware of how the CBI website
security audit work was provided to the auditor and whether it involved
fixing or not. But it is strange to know that the company which conducted
the audit for CBI website could not find a simple SQL injection, even it
would have been under limited budgets.

 

Just to give away an example: Last week, we met a govt. dept. who wished to
outsource auditing work worth 10L and we were surprised to know that they
kept the condition for the qualification for the bidders who have turnover
of above 40Crs. which makes absolutely no sense and clearly indicates a
biasness.  

 

Apart from setting up other standards and including empanelment process for
the auditors, I think CERT-IN also needs to ensure that for critical work
like InfoSec such qualification criteria should fall under some pre-defined
standards else there would be biased tenders involving corruption, leading
to worthless audit and resulting into shame for the country.

Guys,

Apologies however i beg to differ a bit here. we should also understand
NIC's constraints. They do scan sites for vulnerabilities, however with
limited budget, so that does hurt a bit. I'd still say that it's not
completely NIC's fault. If respective application focals dont fix things on
their end even after seeing high risk issues whom to blame?

 

Govt officials can't really push (ideally they should have the power,
however I doubt if they are delegated that much authority)

 

Again consider the case of shared servers which have poor config because
some legacy application running on it needs FTP/telent! Sucks.... But these
are practical challenges! You can't force the business to go down because of
these hiccups. If you push them harder, believe me you'll find a tough time
justifying your actions. 

 

End result weak server configurations, unpatched and wide open apps invite
people to hack in!

 

Now that something like this is witnessed, I am hoping that folks at NIC can
use this as an opportunity to push respective app focal's and tighten their
security. It's only when brand is tarnished that people take things
seriously! 

 

Hope things change soon.... Fingers crossed!


Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod,

 

Thanks,

Chintan

Your statement makes me worried at multiple levels. 

1. Does nobody do website scanning for user input verification before they
make it live ? I think apart from the contact form there was hardly any
user-input in the whole website ? Close out the user-input related pages and
SQL injection issues go away for a while, the rest of the website can be
back.

2. Why don't they rely on robust open source like wordpress/drupal for
simple content based sites which anyway don't have any useful information.
Atleast the patches get released regularly and can be easily applied.
Ofcourse if they contract out theme building the likelihood is the 90's
style themes would have vulnerabilities built into it by newbies who code
it, there a few things that don't work well with a tendering process and
building web applications is one of them. Otherwise its monstrosities like
the MCA21 website is what it results in at a huge cost to the taxpayers. 

3. What prevents them from putting up a static page that website is being
restored instead of just doing a disappearing act.

4. This is not the first time it has happened to NIC, how many heads have
rolled till now.

5. The below mentioned link makes for a real sad reading, its not hard for a
big spender like Government to hire a few ex-Google,ex-Yahoo! , ex-Amazon
folks in India these days to fix web security from the ground up.

If you read the article just shared by me, it mentions that CBI website had

If NIC was a hosting company they wouldn't be getting any business for
managed services for their legendary incompetence, do they have an SLA to
restore stuff in finite time, I mean the napakis hosted their websites in US
so understable they were fiddling with ftp to upload stuff from their
blazing fast cheaper than India DSL lines, but what sort of 'enterprise'
tape drive backups do these folks at NIC use that they can't restore a
static website no more than a few megabytes for so long.

Shit happens all the time its the MTTR that matters more. 

India seems to have its fill of incompetent bureaucrats like the ones at
CERT-IN  ( where some sweater knitting ladies pick up the official phone
mentioned on their website with responses like CERT-IN woh kya hai type
answers when you call them up to verify their PGP key fingerprint as
recommended on their website )

SCIPP International ( www.scippinternational.org ) offers two courses that are accredited by ANSI.

 

The first course is directed at application developers and related technical staff and is a 4-hour, on-line course that satisfies 6.5 of the PCI-DSS and 5.2 of the PA-DSS that introduces the participant to the current OWASP Top-10.

 

The second course is geared to general end-users and is a combination of a general awareness course on best business practices (traditional security awareness) combined with a Payment Card specific module, that meets the training requirements found in section 12 of the PCI-DSS.

 

You can contact me directly if you need additional information.
