Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Discounted OWASP membership for Asia Pacific countries

Hello,

OWASP has recently announced a new membership model.  Now you might be able
to pay a discounted membership while enjoying the full benefits of a OWASP
member.  For example, the regular  annual membership fee is $50, but people
from some developing countries pay only $20.  To find out how to take
advantage of this discount, just send an email to your chapter leader or
reply to this email.

Benefits of OWASP members include professional association, voting rights
for OWASP elections, as well as discounted attendance at OWASP conferences.
For example, if you are a member, then there is no charge to attend AppSec
Asia 2011 in Beijing, China from November 8 to
11<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Global_AppSec_Asia_2011>
.

OWASP is a worldwide not-for-profit organization.  For the last ten years,
it provides free, open and unbiased application security materials to the
public.  Your donation supports your local chapter and other operational
costs.  To become a proud member today, please go to *
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Please_Join_Us* and then click on
the Donate Now button in the* Individual Supporters* table.

Dear user of lists.owasp.org,

We have found that your email account was used to send a huge amount of spam messages during the last week.
Most likely your computer was infected and now runs a trojan proxy server.

We recommend that you follow our instruction in order to keep your computer safe.

Have a nice day,

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Project Jugaad released
Message-ID: <CANn_HrzKmvaL+irXBb0Xp1gXZeBeLA==sZcYsuqt9bpYFBe4Eg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've released the first version of Jugaad library. 'libjugaad' enables a
binary to inject code (as a thread) within the context of another process on
Linux. It exposes a simple API which is somewhat similar to
CreateRemoteThread() on Windows and is very easy to use.



int create_remote_thread(pid_t pid,
                                     size_t stack_size,
                                     unsigned char * tpayload,
                                     size_t tpsize,
                                     int thread_flags,
                                     int mmap_prot,
                                     int mmap_flags,
                                     void * bkpaddr);

For the knowledge hungry and for people who missed my talk at nullcon 2011,
the detail paper is uploaded on http://null.co.in/2011/07/03/project-jugaad/.
If time permits I'll also post a video on the usage and internals of the
library on SecurityTube.

Why create the library?
Because there is no such (until now :p) functionality provided by the *nix
platform for remote thread injection.

Why this email?
A request to test / use the API. Appreciate feedback from people on what
distribution it fails or if there are any bugs - as I am yet to deliver it
at defcon 2011. Your contribution (a valid bug report) would definately be
mentioned as contributor in my presentation.

Source code?
Details: http://null.co.in/2011/07/03/project-jugaad-2/
git repo: git://github.com/aseemjakhar/jugaad.git

Cheers,
