Hello leaders,

We have received a request for a panelist to speak InfoSecurity in London,
June 2015:

<A HREF="http://www.reedexpo.com/en/Events/4031/Infosecurity-Europe">http://www.reedexpo.com/en/Events/4031/Infosecurity-Europe</A>

The session will be held at 15.30-16.25 on Tuesday 2 June and is described
below. Please forward this message along to your chapter or project list,
or if you know someone who would be a good candidate, let me know.

I have also asked the InfoSecurity conference producers to review our OWASP
Speakers Project page where OWASP members can indicate their availability
to speak on a variety of topics. I encourage all OWASP members to add ther
name to this list if you would like to represent OWASP at events. Speaking
at events is a great way to network and get professional exposure. Also,
OWASP Foundation has limited funding available for speaker's travel if the
hosting org doesn't cover everything, so be sure to check that out as well.

Secure Development Panel Discussion for InfoSecurity/London:

&gt;<i>From DevOps to DevSec: Securing application development
</I>
Rapid innovation, agile software development and speed to market of new
mobile and web applications have never been greater priorities for
enterprises. As a result security is often compromised as developers are
pushed to code quickly and business growth and competitive advantage are
prioritised.  Software development and security teams continue to work in
siloes with product managers, with no security expertise, driving the
development of applications. Communication failures between the business
and security continue to result in hastily developed mobile and web apps,
leaving the organisation exposed to data leakage. So what are the obstacles
to achieving secure development and how can they be overcome? How can
security and development work together to ensure that security is built in
at the design stage? What is the role of DevOps in achieving secure
applications?

During this session the panel will assess the security challenges
associated with agile development and discuss steps you can take to
minimise the risk within your organisation.

*Evaluate the vulnerabilities of unsecured applications and how to protect
against them

* Understand DevOps and how it can be used to embed security into the
development cycle

* Discover how to communicate security to key stakeholders and collaborate
to ensure that security is prioritised in the design and development
process and applications are secure

* Establish contractual best practices when working with offshore and third
party developers

* Get to grips with the governance and compliance issues around security
for agile software development

Anyone who is interested and willing to travel to London in June, please
send me a bio to forward on to the InfoSecurity conference planners. And
thanks for passing along to your chapter and project members.
