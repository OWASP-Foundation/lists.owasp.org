CALL FOR PAPERS

 

Second International Workshop on Privacy and Security in Online Social Media
(PSOSM)

<A HREF="http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/events/psosm2013">http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/events/psosm2013</A>

Co-located with 22nd International World Wide Web Conference

Rio, Brazil

May 13 - 17, 2013

 

With increase in the usage of the Internet, there has been an exponential
increase in the use of online social media on the Internet. Websites like
Facebook, YouTube, Orkut, Twitter, Flickr, Google+, FourSquare, Pinterest,
and the likes have changed the way the Internet is being used. However,
widely used, there is a lack of understanding of privacy and security issues
on online social media. Privacy and security of online social media need to
be investigated, studied and characterized from various perspectives
(computational, cultural, psychological, etc.).  It is critical to detect
security threats and defend privacy through real-time and scalable systems.
Since there are no logical boundaries for the social media, it is important
to study the problem from an international perspective too. The main goals
of the workshop are: To create a platform to discuss latest and upcoming
issues, trends, and cutting-edge research approaches in security and privacy
in online social media / complex networked systems; (2) To bring researchers
who are working separately on security and privacy, and online social media,
to discuss the problems that overlap and bring these two areas together.

 

Topics / themes include, but not limited to the following:

- Information privacy disclosure, revelation and its effects in OSM and
online social networks

- Collateral damage due to information leakage (e.g. through photo tagging)
on OSM

- Privacy issues related to location based services on OSM

- Effective and usable privacy setting and policies on OSM

- Anonymization of social network dataset

- Identifying and preventing social spam (including phishing and frauds)
campaigns

- Tracking social footprint / identities across different social network

- Detection and characterization of spam, phishing, frauds, hate crime,
abuse, extremism via online social media

- Cyber-bullying, abuse and harassment detection, and prevention strategies

- Identifying and curbing malware, phishing, and botnets on OSM

- Filtering of pornography, viruses, and human trafficking on OSM

- Studying the social and economic impact of security and privacy issues on
OSM

- User behavior towards change in privacy features in OSM

- Usability (including design flaws) of secure systems on online social
media

- Data modeling of human behavior in context of security and privacy threats

- Privacy and security in social gaming applications

- Trust systems based on social networks

- Legal and ethical issues for researchers studying security and privacy on
OSM

- Information credibility on OSM

- Security and Privacy issues in new entrants in OSM (e.g. Google Plus)

- Effect of OSM on conventional crime (robberies and theft)

- Means to maintain different legitimate identities on the same OSM service

- Access control, rights management, and security of social content

- Privacy-enhancing technologies, including anonymity, pseudonymity and
identity management, specifically for the web

- Identifying fraudulent entities in online social networks

- Problems due to unification of different identities of the same persona on
different social media services

- Using social media (e.g. Twitter) as sensors for decision making at the
organization level (i.e. detecting outbreaks)
