Subject: [Owasp-leaders] OWASP Seraphimdroid new version - Educational
framework
To: OWASP Leaders <owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>,
owasp-community at lists.owasp.org


Hello everyone,

I would like just to announce that we released a new version of OWASP
Seraphimdroid app on Google Play. It can be downloaded from here:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owasp.seraphimdroid

The new version is mainly a result of Google Summer of code, however,
certain things were improved earlier during the year. The main new thing is
an educational framework, that somehow correlates to one of the initiatives
that were lately quite often mentioned over leaders mailing list. Over
OWASP Seraphimdroid, we don't aim to teach security professionals, however,
we are aiming on mobile the users, since the ignorance is usual reason for
being pwnd. We developed a web interface from which we can push new
articles to mobile devices that have installed OWASP Seraphimdroid and a
component where a user can view and search these articles on the phone.
Currently we have only about 6-7 articles (about Open WiFi, weak passwords,
permissions, device encryption, etc.), however we are looking for more. If
anyone is interested in writing some user oriented recommendations that are
android related, please let me know.

I wrote a blog post about what we did and what is new. It can be found
here: http://inspiratron.org/blog/2016/08/28/educational-
framework-added-to-owasp-seraphimdroid/

It would be nice if you can spread the word on your blogs and social media.
Also, inclusion in the next OWASP Connector will be highly appreciated.



Best regards,
