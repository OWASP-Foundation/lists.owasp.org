OWASP Community,

Jim Bird, Katy Anton, Abdessamad Temmar, Colin Watson, myself and several
other volunteers have been working on the OWASP Proactive Controls 2.0
document. This is intended to be a developer AppSec awareness doc in
everyone's favorite art form - a *Top Ten* list.

The doc is currently in draft form and we would love your help and
suggestions before our final release. Our goal is to make this document
brief but helpful to instruct developers to build more secure software.

The doc is in "world edit" mode so *anyone* can make direct comments or
edits to the doc, even anonymously.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e38W6fGv6PmTEFSAwCr9rOj_ACAeKz1bKYgDj2mCACs/edit?usp=sharing

Thanks for your help!

Aloha,
Jim Manico

Hi Mayank,

The mentioned event is not an OWASP Delhi chapter event. The event is
organized by AppVigil at their office. We thought this could be of interest
to members so passed on the invite.

Regarding OWASP Delhi chapter meets we are open and willing to conduct them
in Delhi area provided we get someone to provide us a venue which can
accommodate around 50 - 60 people.

Everyone , I would like to take this opportunity to request if anyone has
availability of venue in Delhi area we would be happy to discuss further
and host our meets in Delhi.

Currently we have venues in Noida and Gurgaon and are hosting our chapter
meets in Gurgaon.

Thanks
Sandeep

Fellow OWASPians,

Check this out -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Incident_Response_Project

Released last week at New York City's Chapter meeting and being led by an
OWASP Board Member himself (Tom Brennan). Seems promising.

Hi Sandeep,
Thanks for the effort. This really is a great step towards mobility and it
will help numerous people.

Just wanted to add, not just post meeting, but we can do these sessions
live as well. Something like a webinar or so.

Thanks
Navdeep

We can also store videos on YouTube by having our own channel.
BrightTalk.com would also be a great place to start with.
