<PRE>Hi Shakun,

 

    As far as Frame injection is concerned, it comprises of two terms
'frame' and 'injection'.

Basically &lt;iframe&gt; tags are used for it as it is treated as invisible
frame. So Frame injection is injection of various frames in a page that
can download malicious executable application that may contain virus or
worms.

Finding frame injection in a page is easy. Check the 'View Source' of
the HTML pages returned by the server and look for frame or iframe tags.
If you find something suspicious like IPs or contents you have to
manually remove them. This was a brief introduction to frame injection.

 

As far as Session Replay is concerned, if your session is very much
valid even after you have logged out of the application or if an
attacker manages to capture your sessionID then he may relogin using
your sessionID . This is session replay attack. So the sessionID
assigned to you by the server must be valid for your particular session
with the application only. As soon as you log out of the application it
should be invalidated so that it can't be replayed by anyone by
capturing it. Also the sessionID must be regenerated in next
'successful' login and must be long and random in nature.

 

Hope this helps
