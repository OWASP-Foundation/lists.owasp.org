<PRE>I can't explain more specifically in your case but as a general rule if
your application is not validating or filtering user input properly then
scripts can be entered or injections can be entered for example, SQL
injection.

Exploiting that flaw &lt;iframe&gt; tag too can be injected in the application
and if the application having any forum or message box it can be stored
permanently using scripts. The source of iframe can be any malicious
link or IP containing malicious contents. Attackers can give malicious
links as inputs to a GET or POST that will get loaded into a frame or
iFrame and compromise user security.

 

This is one of the ways to exploit the issue. 

 

And even if a hacker manages to break in your server-as per your
assumption-he will try to break access control mechanism of server.
Although I can't shed more light on this. I am sorry for that.

 

Hope this helps.

Hi Nilesh

 

Can u please explain it in more detail? How it happens and how these
hackers are able to insert iframe tags in html files while they do not
have write permission to write on server. How they modify the contents
in html or php files. 

 

Please help us in understanding this security threat.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-delhi] Frame Injection and session replay

 

Hi Shakun,

 

    As far as Frame injection is concerned, it comprises of two terms
'frame' and 'injection'.

Basically &lt;iframe&gt; tags are used for it as it is treated as invisible
frame. So Frame injection is injection of various frames in a page that
can download malicious executable application that may contain virus or
worms.

Finding frame injection in a page is easy. Check the 'View Source' of
the HTML pages returned by the server and look for frame or iframe tags.
If you find something suspicious like IPs or contents you have to
manually remove them. This was a brief introduction to frame injection.

 

As far as Session Replay is concerned, if your session is very much
valid even after you have logged out of the application or if an
attacker manages to capture your sessionID then he may relogin using
your sessionID . This is session replay attack. So the sessionID
assigned to you by the server must be valid for your particular session
with the application only. As soon as you log out of the application it
should be invalidated so that it can't be replayed by anyone by
capturing it. Also the sessionID must be regenerated in next
'successful' login and must be long and random in nature.

 

Hope this helps
