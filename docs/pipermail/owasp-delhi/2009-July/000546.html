<PRE>Hi Nilesh

 

Can u please explain it in more detail? How it happens and how these hackers
are able to insert iframe tags in html files while they do not have write
permission to write on server. How they modify the contents in html or php
files. 

 

Please help us in understanding this security threat.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-delhi] Frame Injection and session replay

 

Hi Shakun,

 

    As far as Frame injection is concerned, it comprises of two terms
'frame' and 'injection'.

Basically &lt;iframe&gt; tags are used for it as it is treated as invisible frame.
So Frame injection is injection of various frames in a page that can
download malicious executable application that may contain virus or worms.

Finding frame injection in a page is easy. Check the 'View Source' of the
HTML pages returned by the server and look for frame or iframe tags. If you
find something suspicious like IPs or contents you have to manually remove
them. This was a brief introduction to frame injection.

 

As far as Session Replay is concerned, if your session is very much valid
even after you have logged out of the application or if an attacker manages
to capture your sessionID then he may relogin using your sessionID . This is
session replay attack. So the sessionID assigned to you by the server must
be valid for your particular session with the application only. As soon as
you log out of the application it should be invalidated so that it can't be
replayed by anyone by capturing it. Also the sessionID must be regenerated
in next 'successful' login and must be long and random in nature.

 

Hope this helps
