Subject: Re: [Owasp-delhi] Frame Injection and session replay

 
I can&#8217;t explain more specifically in your case but as a
general rule if your application is not validating or filtering user input
properly then scripts can be entered or injections can be entered for example, SQL
injection.
Exploiting that flaw &lt;iframe&gt; tag too can be injected in
the application and if the application having any forum or message box it can
be stored permanently using scripts. The source of iframe can be any malicious
link or IP containing malicious contents.Attackers can give malicious
links as inputs to a GET or POST that will get loaded into a frame or iFrame
and compromise user security.
 
This is one of the ways to exploit the issue. 
 
And even if a hacker manages to break in your server&#8212;as per
your assumption&#8212;he will try to break access control mechanism of server.
Although I can&#8217;t shed more light on this. I am sorry for that.
 
Hope this helps.

Hi Nilesh
 
Can u please explain it in more detail? How it happens and how
these hackers are able to insert iframe tags in html files while they do not
have write permission to write on server. How they modify the contents in html
or php files. 
 
Please help us in understanding
this security threat.

Hi Shakun,
 
    As far as Frame injection is
concerned, it comprises of two terms &#8216;frame&#8217; and
&#8216;injection&#8217;.
Basically &lt;iframe&gt; tags are used for it as it is treated
as invisible frame. So Frame injection is injection of various frames in a page
that can download malicious executable application that may contain virus or
worms.
Finding frame injection in a page is easy. Check the &#8216;View
Source&#8217; of the HTML pages returned by the server and look for frame or
iframe tags. If you find something suspicious like IPs or contents you have to
manually remove them. This was a brief introduction to frame injection.
 
As far as Session Replay is concerned, if your session is very
much valid even after you have logged out of the application or if an attacker
manages to capture your sessionID then he may relogin using your sessionID .
This is session replay attack. So the sessionID assigned to you by the server
must be valid for your particular session with the application only. As soon as
you log out of the application it should be invalidated so that it can&#8217;t
be replayed by anyone by capturing it. Also the sessionID must be regenerated
in next &#8216;successful&#8217; login and must be long and random in nature.
 
Hope this helps
