Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] query:Linux web server Logs
Message-ID: <CAF7-T7DzKgw_0ckKF9KmN_zyQ97EunCYjSVaLnovbYpjDgsPSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I am a beginner and have a query, please guide:

What kind of server logs we need to maintain which can be helpful in
investigations. As of now I keep these:

1) Website Access Log
/usr/local/apache/logs/access_log
/usr/local/apache/domlogs

2) FTP Acees Log
/var/log/messages

3) MySQL Access Log
/var/lib/mysql called hostname.log and hostname-slow.log where hostname is
the short hostname for the machine.

4) Cpanel Access Log
/usr/local/cpanel/logs/access_log

Thanks & Regards,
Learner Kid

Ideally you should secure all session and transaction logs.

 

Sessions will be for login logout failed etc and transaction should tell what was the command issues and what happened

location?

Message-ID: <CAN9ux9yCqjwpDoJft3CUvcHLN9ziwbnyO16Cd-PGjy04fV3paw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Rishi,

Good post. For any development team, OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability protection
is an achievable/tangible baseline to have, compliance-driven or not. I
definitely agree that it shouldn't be the ONLY list to certify your app.
against. And yes, a pen tester ought to look beyond it, provided the scope
of engagement permits so.

On another note, OWASP Top 10 Proactive Control list is an interesting
prevention-based approach (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls).

Organizations could potentially use both OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities and
OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls to set a solid baseline first. Then go for
a pen test from creative tester(s) and add the additional findings to the
baseline. As time progresses, repeating the process would strengthen the
testing posture.

Ideally, securing all phases of the SDLC would be the perfect
approach/solution, but, we live in a world full of release deadlines, time
constraints, resource constraints, NFR perceptions etc. :-)

Message-ID: <CAAvjMhMr96b_6mgV=po9ifrTiqun7vjtkUV8QKEy=PT9kzHK-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

*WebGoat* is undergoing a major *modernization effort*.  Already, the old
UI and infrastructure have been replaced. The project is at a point where
it needs your feedback

*Which lessons should be imported?*

Fill out our *survey
<https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OWASP-WebGoat-Modernization> *(it only
takes about 5 minutes), and *help prioritize the next effort*.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OWASP-WebGoat-Modernization

In each section, mark "Keep" for the lessons you feel are valuable. For
those you are not familiar with, mark "Indifferent."  For those that need
to go, mark "Discard." (Each question requires a response.)

NOTE: Just because a lesson may be buggy, does not mean it is not valuable.
This is not a survey for how WebGoat works but a survey to understand which
lessons are important and should be ported first.

Survey closes September 14th

Message-ID: <CAAvjMhPrh3YHARatrPdTLdWR+ETLw+5TLn2kMeFv3nH3DQ-fcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

The OWASP Testing Guide Version 4 has been publicly released

There are several changes between v3 and v4. Several new chapters have been
introduced and the existing chapters improved. The test cases have been
expanded to 87 (64 test cases in v3)

This v4 of the guide also integrates with the two other flagship OWASP
documentation products: The Developers Guide and The Code Review Guide.

The Guide is a "live" document and your feedbacks are always accepted and
appreciated. Please join the mailing list and share your ideas
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing

The OWASP Testing Guide includes a "best practice" penetration testing
framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a "low
level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for testing most
common web application and web service security issues.

Download or browse the Guide from:

- https://www.owasp.org/images/1/19/OTGv4.pdf

- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

Thanks
