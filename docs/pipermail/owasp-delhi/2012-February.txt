Dear OWASPians,

 

With the OWASP conference fever ON, we come up with tons of updates every
week on OWASP's upcoming conference planned for 24-25th August 2012.

 

Rather we SPAM this list every now and then, we found it better to connect
the OWASP community over the social media sites to watch the updates in
real-time without flooding your mailboxes. We will only announce the major
updates on OWASP list and for rest stay connected on Twitter, Facebook and
LinkedIn. 

 

Here are the links for our social media channels.
