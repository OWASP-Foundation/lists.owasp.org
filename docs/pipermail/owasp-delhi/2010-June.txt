Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Who is responsible for Application Security in the
	SDLC?
Message-ID: <001101cb01a4$ba078370$2e168a50$@org>

As members of OWASP, this webinar might not be for you - as you already know
about the importance of security in web-applications - but what about
getting others involved? Ever wanted to get your Program Managers a little
more familiar with the principals of secure coding? How about QA or the
Architects?  And what about the Team Leads and certainly the new Developers
who you'll be working beside.

 

Why not suggest that they attend a webinar specifically tailored for them. 

 

Featured Webinar:  <http://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/20658> WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR APPLICATION SECURITY in the Software Development Lifecycle?

Sponsored by: SCIPP International

 

WHEN: Live, June 3rd, 2:00 EST, or anytime after via Webcast

 

SPEAKER: Dow Williamson, CISSP, CSSLP, Executive Director of SCIPP
International

About This 45-Minute Webinar

You will hear that application security is a "finger-pointing" blame game.
Traditional Security staff claim that it's the responsibility of the
Developers.  Developers say security is not mandated in the design specs.
And, Program Managers think security has to do with patches and virus
scanners. No one seems to know who is responsible - and typically, no one
steps up and takes responsibility. 

This webinar will explore how to change all of this through a three-tiered
approach - Awareness, Training, and Education. Depending on your role within
the SDLC, you have some responsibilities for security - but to what extent
is determined by various factors. Some may just need to be familiar with the
fundamentals of secure coding, while others may need in-depth training -
while even others may want a formalized education and possibly receive
certification of their skills and knowledge.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Orkut Signout via scrap
Message-ID: <AANLkTilBZAzG-dpLPB7uivGOtl0nhseODO5QvFH_-4V7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

There is a small bug in orkut scrapbook that if any one sends a scrp
containing the following code

<div class="para">
<embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
src="promote.orkut.co.in/redirect?u=http://www.orkut.co.in/GLogin?cmd=logout"
style="" id="979482838" name="979482838" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"
quality="autohigh" wmode="transparent" allownetworking="internal"
allowscriptaccess="never" height="1" width="1">

Then the recipient will logout automatically from the orkut.

Same thing occurred to me while I was browsing and mail was sent to me
from my friend Nikhil and In case same thing occurs with you then you
should try to delete that scrap on next login and In case you are
unable to do that then you can simply disable flash then you will be
able to delete that scrap.

Cheers,
Rockey Killer

Its not just rediff.com, almost all other Indian portals - in.com,
indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection,
Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless.

I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year,
and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.

Rediff had several vulnerabilities at many pages. I had informed them last
year itself. They didn't care until some senior guy from Rediff asked them
to fix them. So its old trend in Rediff. Similar is the case of Indiatimes.

I've notified a senior person in Rediff who inturn will engage with the
Tech team. If there is someone in Mumbai OWASP who can help explain and
talk to the team there, I can patch the person on. Thanks
 

warm regards,

I think ringing the only door bell is not illegal, until unless you do
something that can harm them financially. I have several times informed them
about various vulns but they took action after a very long time.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what your password is in case you have forgotten it ;). When brought to their notice, I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us, we will get back to you shortly. Nobody has got back till date (1 year past). I think strong legislative punitive measures are the only solution.

Its not just rediff.com , almost all other Indian portals - in.com , indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection, Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless. 


I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year, and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.

Old saying and a song ? ?It happens only in India?. Till the time laws aren?t enforced with a force, no one is bothered about security. Even laws can be bypassed here, but atleast few would be trapped to set the example for others.

 

When I explain India InfoSec to the friends abroad, I generally blame the Indian mindset. Bike Riders here don?t care about their personal security and wear helmets only when there is strict police checking. Same is with the car drivers for their seat belts. In Delhi, we find better police checking so people are serious, but in other areas like Noida, no one cares. In a nutshell, only strict laws can help Corporate India to be secure and deliver secure.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what your password is in case you have forgotten it ;).  When brought to their notice, I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us, we will get back to you shortly.  Nobody has got back till date (1 year past).  I think strong legislative punitive measures are the only solution.

As a responsible infosec person,everytime we try to wake up these Big
Industries Management (government/private/public),but they feel that their
job is permanent and secure so as their webservers and applications.

They are very careless to take necessary security measures even after proof
of vulnerability and sometimes they forget to reply.

In India,78% of all companies or sectors believe "we are secure because no
one is attacking". They have one more strong thinking that "It is easier to
show 'site under maintenance' and backup all hacked data rather than putting
security to protect those data".

Indirectly they are responsible themselves for promoting US/Chinese/Russian
hackers the song "come,play and win (hack) our valuable national websites".

With regards,

I don't know if it can happen under the ageis of OWASP or not but maybe
we need something like a Jagorey campaign and a "fall of shame". I'm
banking on this group's collective wisdom to do something...

*	
	The Jagorey like campaign is for the CxO forums who are often
unware of the problem in their own backyard as the tech manager never
notified them or didn't give them enough gyan (specially to CTO/CISO).
Maybe leverage NASSCOM for such forums (for contact points)
*	
	The fall of shame is for sites we identity as "bad" weak thru
non-intriusive testing and advise the public about the risks of the
weakness exists even after notification to the company. I understand
such a list opens up more hacks/attacks, and thus we can refrain from
displaying the vulnerable url and details on the attack. CERT-in may be
leveraged for this. I also do not know the complete legal interpretation
of such a move (which may include defamation suits) 

The point I'm trying to make is we know we have issues, with corporate
indfifference to security, with laws that are not enforced well, with
"security people" just doing what I call "khanapoorti" i.e action for
the sake of it. The problems will not go away. As a responsibile
community can we create a task force and collectively do something?. I
do understand the individual efforts like Nilesh's / Sripathi's or
Subhash's and others have fallen on deaf ears and is
frustrating....maybe concerted and joint efforts will bear fruits. 
 
Additional thoughts/comments/feedback...
 
 PS: I use Jagorey like as refernce, as Jagorey campaign is a TV advt
showing a movement against corruption.
 

warm regards,

Sriram

SEC_R_TY. U & I are in it together. Everyone's responsible - Everywhere

Old saying and a song - "It happens only in India". Till the time laws
aren't enforced with a force, no one is bothered about security. Even
laws can be bypassed here, but atleast few would be trapped to set the
example for others.

 

When I explain India InfoSec to the friends abroad, I generally blame
the Indian mindset. Bike Riders here don't care about their personal
security and wear helmets only when there is strict police checking.
Same is with the car drivers for their seat belts. In Delhi, we find
better police checking so people are serious, but in other areas like
Noida, no one cares. In a nutshell, only strict laws can help Corporate
India to be secure and deliver secure.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores
passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what
your password is in case you have forgotten it ;).  When brought to
their notice, I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us,
we will get back to you shortly.  Nobody has got back till date (1 year
past).  I think strong legislative punitive measures are the only
solution.

Its not just rediff.com, almost all other Indian portals - in.com,
indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL
Injection, Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list
is endless. 

 

I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past
year, and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their
websites.

That sounds like government supportive lang., seems you have had a good time with them J No offensive though, I like that. 

 

I could better think of collective idea from Subhash?s and Sriram?s post to have a central portal dedicated towards web application breaches and flaws in India, just like WASC (which is for global). The count of vulnerabilities that WASC could build over 10 years for global websites, I am sure, we can build similar database for Indian web applications in around 1yr itself J

 

We could think of a model where a vuln. is firstly reported to the owner and CERT-IN to show our responsibility for the provider. Thereafter, give some time window to fix the problem. If nothing happens in the window and/or there is no response from the owner, we show our responsibility for the consumer and publish it over the portal.

 

We can further brainstorm keeping CERT-IN in loop to drive something fruitful. Connect me offline if anyone of you is interested to mature this idea, we can catch up somewhere in NCR, pitch this idea as an OWASP India Project, participate as volunteers, and do something good for owner, consumers and govt.

 

Cheers!

Dhruv

I agree with this proposal.  My further suggestions:-

 (a)  Involve CERT-In fully.  This will take care of the legal hassles as it is their mandate.
 (b)  Follow some thing like responsible disclosure.  Sending vulnerability information through a central point of contact (preferably at CERT-In).

I don't know if it can happen under the ageis of OWASP or not but maybe we need something like a Jagorey campaign and a "fall of shame". I'm banking on this group's collective wisdom to do something...

*	The Jagorey like campaign is for the CxO forums who are often unware of the problem in their own backyard as the tech manager never notified them or didn't give them enough gyan (specially to CTO/CISO). Maybe leverage NASSCOM for such forums (for contact points)
*	The fall of shame is for sites we identity as "bad" weak thru  non-intriusive testing and advise the public about the risks of the weakness exists even after notification to the company. I understand such a list opens up more hacks/attacks, and thus we can refrain from displaying the vulnerable url and details on the attack. CERT-in may be leveraged for this. I also do not know the complete legal interpretation of such a move (which may include defamation suits) 

The point I'm trying to make is we know we have issues, with corporate indfifference to security, with laws that are not enforced well, with "security people" just doing what I call "khanapoorti" i.e action for the sake of it. The problems will not go away. As a responsibile community can we create a task force and collectively do something?. I do understand the individual efforts like Nilesh's / Sripathi's or Subhash's and others have fallen on deaf ears and is frustrating....maybe concerted and joint efforts will bear fruits. 

 

Additional thoughts/comments/feedback...

 

 PS: I use Jagorey like as refernce, as Jagorey campaign is a TV advt showing a movement against corruption.

 

warm regards,

Sriram

SEC_R_TY. U & I are in it together. Everyone?s responsible - Everywhere

Old saying and a song ? ?It happens only in India?. Till the time laws aren?t enforced with a force, no one is bothered about security. Even laws can be bypassed here, but atleast few would be trapped to set the example for others.

 

When I explain India InfoSec to the friends abroad, I generally blame the Indian mindset. Bike Riders here don?t care about their personal security and wear helmets only when there is strict police checking. Same is with the car drivers for their seat belts. In Delhi, we find better police checking so people are serious, but in other areas like Noida, no one cares. In a nutshell, only strict laws can help Corporate India to be secure and deliver secure.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what your password is in case you have forgotten it ;).  When brought to their notice, I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us, we will get back to you shortly.  Nobody has got back till date (1 year past).  I think strong legislative punitive measures are the only solution.

Its not just rediff.com, almost all other Indian portals - in.com, indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection, Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless. 

 

I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year, and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.

I agree with this proposal. My further suggestions:- 

(a) Involve CERT-In fully. This will take care of the legal hassles as it is their mandate. 
(b) Follow some thing like responsible disclosure. Sending vulnerability information through a central point of contact (preferably at CERT-In).

CERT-In has a charter to send advisories for improving national cyber
security. The organization also monitors attacks on web applications and
networks  including malware attacks.

 

We should write to CERT-In for issuances of necessary guidelines and
enforcing security measures.

 

Best wishes

I don't know if it can happen under the ageis of OWASP or not but maybe we
need something like a Jagorey campaign and a "fall of shame". I'm banking on
this group's collective wisdom to do something...

*	The Jagorey like campaign is for the CxO forums who are often unware
of the problem in their own backyard as the tech manager never notified them
or didn't give them enough gyan (specially to CTO/CISO). Maybe leverage
NASSCOM for such forums (for contact points)
*	The fall of shame is for sites we identity as "bad" weak thru
non-intriusive testing and advise the public about the risks of the weakness
exists even after notification to the company. I understand such a list
opens up more hacks/attacks, and thus we can refrain from displaying the
vulnerable url and details on the attack. CERT-in may be leveraged for this.
I also do not know the complete legal interpretation of such a move (which
may include defamation suits) 

The point I'm trying to make is we know we have issues, with corporate
indfifference to security, with laws that are not enforced well, with
"security people" just doing what I call "khanapoorti" i.e action for the
sake of it. The problems will not go away. As a responsibile community can
we create a task force and collectively do something?. I do understand the
individual efforts like Nilesh's / Sripathi's or Subhash's and others have
fallen on deaf ears and is frustrating....maybe concerted and joint efforts
will bear fruits. 

 

Additional thoughts/comments/feedback...

 

 PS: I use Jagorey like as refernce, as Jagorey campaign is a TV advt
showing a movement against corruption.

Old saying and a song - "It happens only in India". Till the time laws
aren't enforced with a force, no one is bothered about security. Even laws
can be bypassed here, but atleast few would be trapped to set the example
for others.

 

When I explain India InfoSec to the friends abroad, I generally blame the
Indian mindset. Bike Riders here don't care about their personal security
and wear helmets only when there is strict police checking. Same is with the
car drivers for their seat belts. In Delhi, we find better police checking
so people are serious, but in other areas like Noida, no one cares. In a
nutshell, only strict laws can help Corporate India to be secure and deliver
secure.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores
passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what your
password is in case you have forgotten it ;).  When brought to their notice,
I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us, we will get back
to you shortly.  Nobody has got back till date (1 year past).  I think
strong legislative punitive measures are the only solution.

Its not just rediff.com, almost all other Indian portals - in.com,
indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection,
Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless. 

 

I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year,
and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.

There is a problem with reporting vulnerabilities - every website has
hundreds of them spread all over. Reporting all of them requires a herculean
effort, and without a buy-in from the top management of the website, its not
going to get fixed. Our collective interest will definitely fade if we don't
see some action from the developers.

The state our websites our in, we need action from higher management. If
they don't support the initiative, there is just no way that individual
teams/developers will fix hundreds of web pages. I strongly believe we need
to influence the management to take an active interest in application
security.

So, instead of vulnerability database, I propose organizing training
sessions for website owners/developers. Perhaps an India wide OWASP meet,
with the stated goal of 'Increasing corporate awareness towards Application
Security'. We can perhaps have a two day seminar, with sessions for business
folks as well as for developers and testers.

Getting sponsors should not be an issue. This also falls well within the
purview of OWASP, so we won't have any legal/political issues. We can use
our individual contacts to make sure most Indian portal owners are aware of
this seminar and have adequate representation. And we can find a lot of
people from this group to help out with the training material, seminars,
presentations and such.

I think that is the best use of the people in this group. Another database
of vulnerabilities is not going to take us too far IMHO.

Sri,

 

I couldn't agree more.  Your thoughts are spot-on.

 

I'd be more than happy to offer our services in some form or fashion.  Like
OWASP, SCIPP International was founded as a not-for-profit with the sole
purpose of evangelizing security awareness.  Besides a traditional security
awareness course geared towards the end-user we offer an awareness course
targeted at those involved in the SDLC which we branded as SWADA or Secure
Web-Application Development Awareness.

 

Although the current SWADA course has been very well received for the past
18 months or so, we have decided to transform it in to 3 nested courses that
build upon one another (sort like a college, 101, 20x  and 3xx series).
Within the next 45 - 60 days we are planning on phasing in the new courses
and replacing the old one with a "series" of highly targeted awareness
courses.  

 

The lowest level course (approx 1.5 hours) will introduces the participant
to the Principles of Secure Coding (think of it as a 101 type of course) and
is intended for everyone who has anything to do with the SDLC. Even though
the course is an ANSI accredited certificate course, it is not intended to
be a full-fledged training course, but mealy an introduction to terms,
concepts and basic understanding of best business practices.  (We'll have
full outlines of the new courses posted on our web-site within the next week
or two)

 

The Into to Principles of Secure Coding course will be supplemented with a
Managerial track (approx 1.5 - 2 additional hours) which will delve in to
topics such as building security in to the SDLC (requirements gathering and
analysis, system design, development and testing, acceptance, O&M and
disposal) - Software Security Requirements; CLASP; Measuring Progress and
Maturity of the SDLC. Of the 3 courses, this course is probably the most
important as it will lead the learner in to understanding WHY security is so
important to bake in - and not try to add on.  We'll touch on how to get
others to buy-in to the SDLC concept as well.  This is the one that meets
your stated requirements below.

 

After completing the two courses above, Technicians will be ready to be
introduced to some specific vulnerabilities associated with
web-applications.  The 3rd course will be our Technical track (approx an
additional 2 hours) that will cover specific vulnerabilities found in the
likes of the OWASP Top-10 and the CWE/SANS Top-25. Discussions will focus on
each of the vulnerabilities and will help the learner identify if they have
a knowledge gap.  Reference materials will be suggested to assist in
furthering their knowledge as well technical training opportunities.  

 

I think you will agree, the courses outlined above will  really hit home
with anyone who is involved with the SDLC - and would be perfect for firms
who are dependent on business critical applications. I also think you will
agree that everyone should embrace an awareness course such as this.

 

If you are interested, let us know how we can help.

 

Warm regards,

 

Don Cochran

There is a problem with reporting vulnerabilities - every website has
hundreds of them spread all over. Reporting all of them requires a herculean
effort, and without a buy-in from the top management of the website, its not
going to get fixed. Our collective interest will definitely fade if we don't
see some action from the developers.

 

The state our websites our in, we need action from higher management. If
they don't support the initiative, there is just no way that individual
teams/developers will fix hundreds of web pages. I strongly believe we need
to influence the management to take an active interest in application
security.

 

So, instead of vulnerability database, I propose organizing training
sessions for website owners/developers. Perhaps an India wide OWASP meet,
with the stated goal of 'Increasing corporate awareness towards Application
Security'. We can perhaps have a two day seminar, with sessions for business
folks as well as for developers and testers. 

 

Getting sponsors should not be an issue. This also falls well within the
purview of OWASP, so we won't have any legal/political issues. We can use
our individual contacts to make sure most Indian portal owners are aware of
this seminar and have adequate representation. And we can find a lot of
people from this group to help out with the training material, seminars,
presentations and such. 

 

I think that is the best use of the people in this group. Another database
of vulnerabilities is not going to take us too far IMHO.

That sounds like government supportive lang., seems you have had a good time
with them J No offensive though, I like that. 

 

I could better think of collective idea from Subhash's and Sriram's post to
have a central portal dedicated towards web application breaches and flaws
in India, just like WASC (which is for global). The count of vulnerabilities
that WASC could build over 10 years for global websites, I am sure, we can
build similar database for Indian web applications in around 1yr itself J

 

We could think of a model where a vuln. is firstly reported to the owner and
CERT-IN to show our responsibility for the provider. Thereafter, give some
time window to fix the problem. If nothing happens in the window and/or
there is no response from the owner, we show our responsibility for the
consumer and publish it over the portal.

 

We can further brainstorm keeping CERT-IN in loop to drive something
fruitful. Connect me offline if anyone of you is interested to mature this
idea, we can catch up somewhere in NCR, pitch this idea as an OWASP India
Project, participate as volunteers, and do something good for owner,
consumers and govt.

 

Cheers!

I agree with this proposal.  My further suggestions:-

 (a)  Involve CERT-In fully.  This will take care of the legal hassles as it
is their mandate.
 (b)  Follow some thing like responsible disclosure.  Sending vulnerability
information through a central point of contact (preferably at CERT-In).

I don't know if it can happen under the ageis of OWASP or not but maybe we
need something like a Jagorey campaign and a "fall of shame". I'm banking on
this group's collective wisdom to do something...

*	The Jagorey like campaign is for the CxO forums who are often unware
of the problem in their own backyard as the tech manager never notified them
or didn't give them enough gyan (specially to CTO/CISO). Maybe leverage
NASSCOM for such forums (for contact points)
*	The fall of shame is for sites we identity as "bad" weak thru
non-intriusive testing and advise the public about the risks of the weakness
exists even after notification to the company. I understand such a list
opens up more hacks/attacks, and thus we can refrain from displaying the
vulnerable url and details on the attack. CERT-in may be leveraged for this.
I also do not know the complete legal interpretation of such a move (which
may include defamation suits) 

The point I'm trying to make is we know we have issues, with corporate
indfifference to security, with laws that are not enforced well, with
"security people" just doing what I call "khanapoorti" i.e action for the
sake of it. The problems will not go away. As a responsibile community can
we create a task force and collectively do something?. I do understand the
individual efforts like Nilesh's / Sripathi's or Subhash's and others have
fallen on deaf ears and is frustrating....maybe concerted and joint efforts
will bear fruits. 

 

Additional thoughts/comments/feedback...

 

 PS: I use Jagorey like as refernce, as Jagorey campaign is a TV advt
showing a movement against corruption.

Sriram

Old saying and a song - "It happens only in India". Till the time laws
aren't enforced with a force, no one is bothered about security. Even laws
can be bypassed here, but atleast few would be trapped to set the example
for others.

 

When I explain India InfoSec to the friends abroad, I generally blame the
Indian mindset. Bike Riders here don't care about their personal security
and wear helmets only when there is strict police checking. Same is with the
car drivers for their seat belts. In Delhi, we find better police checking
so people are serious, but in other areas like Noida, no one cares. In a
nutshell, only strict laws can help Corporate India to be secure and deliver
secure.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores
passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what your
password is in case you have forgotten it ;).  When brought to their notice,
I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us, we will get back
to you shortly.  Nobody has got back till date (1 year past).  I think
strong legislative punitive measures are the only solution.

Its not just rediff.com, almost all other Indian portals - in.com,
indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection,
Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless. 

 

I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year,
and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.

What about the government sites..  there are many sites are vulnerable
to SQL injection, XSS, Parameter Manipulation.. 
 
Do not want to specify any one of them.. but still there are no security
measure and controls in place.. 
 
Hope so once in a while government realize the importance of information
and will take Preventive Action to mitigate risk...

For the government sites .. :) It should be made mandatory for them to 
comply with respective regulatory (security) requirements. Also there 
should be an independent body for security audit and monitoring(for both 
applications and networks). This is not easy for the government 
considering budget bottlenecks, but sooner or later has to be implemented. 

'Security' once in a while.. not enough (for the Govt) cause there might 
be thousands out there waiting for that one moment when we(govt) are not 
alert.

> re. I think this must become a standard part of a vulnerability assessment

Its a clever way of attacking, but IMHO it is applicable under a very small
number of scenarios. In order for a site to be vulnerable, it must meet the
following requirements -

   1. It should store critical data on the client side in an encrypted
   manner, using a particular encryption mode i.e. CBC
   2. It should 'leak' error messages back to the client.
   3. For a single decryption attack to successful, 128*size of message
   calls to the server need to go unnoticed. Each of those calls will lead to
   an exception on the server - and so all of them going unnoticed is a bit
   difficult.
   4. For CAPTCHAs - the server needs to store the solution on the client
   side (in an encrypted manner) - again not that common.
   5. For Viewstate - the site needs to enable client side storage - again a
   non-default setting.

So, rather than testing for this in VA, we should rather enforce your second
comment "Don't store confidential data client side"

re. And brings us to a likely design guideline: don't keep any confidential
> data on the client side. How feasible/realistic is that?

Absolutely feasible and practical. Any critical information must stay on the
server. It should not be sent to the client, encryption or no encryption.

The usual reason for storing information on the client is performance; if
the server is stateless, there is a huge performance improvement. But there
are ways to achieve a stateless architecture *and* still maintain critical
information on the server - it just needs a little bit more work. In other

There are guidelines issued by CERT-In for govt websites. Also, these sites have to be hosted on govt server (either NIC, ERNET or other state agencies). I know for a fact that NIC carries out a very stringent security audit before the site is hosted on a production server. However the agency responsible for pointing out mistakes subsequently, CERT-In, has no mandate for awarding punishments .

For the government sites .. :) It should be made mandatory for them to comply with respective regulatory (security) requirements. Also there should be an independent body for security audit and monitoring(for both applications and networks). This is not easy for the government considering budget bottlenecks, but sooner or later has to be implemented. 
'Security' once in a while.. not enough (for the Govt) cause there might be thousands out there waiting for that one moment when we(govt) are not alert.

What about the government sites.. there are many sites are vulnerable to SQL injection, XSS, Parameter Manipulation.. 

Do not want to specify any one of them.. but still there are no security measure and controls in place.. 

Hope so once in a while government realize the importance of information and will take Preventive Action to mitigate risk...

I think ringing the only door bell is not illegal, until unless you do something that can harm them financially. I have several times informed them about various vulns but they took action after a very long time.

Hello ,


I was expecting some thing similar to hear next when i first time
heard that google is even recording MAC addresses
and here it is

The Wi-Fi traffic collected by Google's world-roving Street View cars
included passwords and email,
according to a report citing a preliminary study from the French data
protection authority.


http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/18/google_street_view_cars_wifi_data_includes_emails_and_passwords/

Google is turning out to be an evil :))

If this was done by any individual i am sure he must have gone behind the bars
but it's google , So is it acceptable ?

Cheers,
Rockey

Hi Guys,

I have been working on the Web.config (ASP.NET) vulnerabilities and their
patch process. Here is a little write-up on the same that may help you.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] "Jagorey" campaign for vulnerabilities on Indian
	Websites -- what's next?
Message-ID: <AANLkTil5bh5PUf3DkEtOqyLMjdY4LbUaUqPLRdI7Wn50@mail.gmail.com>

I hate to see a conversation die down, so pushing it again.

Discussions so far -

   1. Vulnerability Database for Indian websites, or "hall of shame"
   2. Training/Awareness that OWASP members can volunteer for
   3. Should this involve CERT-IN or not?

I am definitely interested in (1) and (2), though I think (1) alone won't
get us the results.

What do others think? And how many people are willing to be involved in
something like this?

Hi Experts,

I need a small help from you.

Is RE legal for security assessments of products purchased from vendors?

There has been a bit of confusion around RE topic.

I know it is illegal to do RE to steal the idea, however this one, I
need feedback from you folks.

If you can share some authoritative resources that could confirm on
the legality/illegality, it would be great.

Yeah, but EULA is not as comprehensive as law.

For example: EULA says, Decompiling and Disassembiling of product is
prohibited.

However there have been cases where if the application/product is
reverse engineered, the decision was in favour or party who reversed
it. The following link provides more details on examples:

Hi Chintan,

 

As per my understanding, if software vendor prohibits reverse engineering in
their EULA, in such cases it is illegal. Also, section 1201(f) of THE
DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT explicitly addresses reverse engineering
from the perspective of copyright infringement and software product code
cracking. For more details you can refer
www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf . 

 

I hope this would help. 

 

 

Suman

you don't have to do any RE yourself, since there are "Binary Analysis Tools" which takes executable and creates a run-time environment then loads each segment and checks for security vulnerabilities/issues.

Agreed! How about Java Applets?

I believe they are subject to manual decompilation. Correct me if I am
wrong.

these tools i.e. "Binary Analysis Tools" are pretty costly and they do support popular programming languages such as C, C++, Java etc.

Moreover, to be honest, there are plenty of Java disassemblers and its just a matter of one or two clicks by the time you get the code in front of your eyes.

However, I'm darn sure that, even for Security Vulnerability testing you are not supposed to do RE & definitely part of IT Policies & Acts of many countries apart from the EULA,? hence the "Binary Analysis Tools" business model came & is a very lucrative.
