<PRE>Since, we pursued few govt. projects available via biddings to public tenders so I would comment in a complete business centric approach here:

 

Most of such tenders are already fixed before going out to the public and most of the times, those are prepared by the company, which ultimately wins at the end. Such are biased tenders with the conditions which can only be fulfilled only by the company who has prepared it and other capable companies get automatically rejected from the bidding process.

 

Providing such favours to the company gives personal benefits to the person at govt. department who is responsible to look after the project. I am certainly not trying to comment, nor I am aware of how the CBI website security audit work was provided to the auditor and whether it involved fixing or not. But it is strange to know that the company which conducted the audit for CBI website could not find a simple SQL injection, even it would have been under limited budgets.

 

Just to give away an example: Last week, we met a govt. dept. who wished to outsource auditing work worth 10L and we were surprised to know that they kept the condition for the qualification for the bidders who have turnover of above 40Crs. which makes absolutely no sense and clearly indicates a biasness.  

 

Apart from setting up other standards and including empanelment process for the auditors, I think CERT-IN also needs to ensure that for critical work like InfoSec such qualification criteria should fall under some pre-defined standards else there would be biased tenders involving corruption, leading to worthless audit and resulting into shame for the country.

Guys,

Apologies however i beg to differ a bit here. we should also understand NIC's constraints. They do scan sites for vulnerabilities, however with limited budget, so that does hurt a bit. I'd still say that it's not completely NIC's fault. If respective application focals dont fix things on their end even after seeing high risk issues whom to blame?

 

Govt officials can't really push (ideally they should have the power, however I doubt if they are delegated that much authority)

 

Again consider the case of shared servers which have poor config because some legacy application running on it needs FTP/telent! Sucks.... But these are practical challenges! You can't force the business to go down because of these hiccups. If you push them harder, believe me you'll find a tough time justifying your actions. 

 

End result weak server configurations, unpatched and wide open apps invite people to hack in!

 

Now that something like this is witnessed, I am hoping that folks at NIC can use this as an opportunity to push respective app focal's and tighten their security. It's only when brand is tarnished that people take things seriously! 

 

Hope things change soon.... Fingers crossed!


Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod,

 

Thanks,

Chintan

Your statement makes me worried at multiple levels. 

1. Does nobody do website scanning for user input verification before they make it live ? I think apart from the contact form there was hardly any user-input in the whole website ? Close out the user-input related pages and SQL injection issues go away for a while, the rest of the website can be back.

2. Why don't they rely on robust open source like wordpress/drupal for simple content based sites which anyway don't have any useful information. Atleast the patches get released regularly and can be easily applied. Ofcourse if they contract out theme building the likelihood is the 90's style themes would have vulnerabilities built into it by newbies who code it, there a few things that don't work well with a tendering process and building web applications is one of them. Otherwise its monstrosities like the MCA21 website is what it results in at a huge cost to the taxpayers. 

3. What prevents them from putting up a static page that website is being restored instead of just doing a disappearing act.

4. This is not the first time it has happened to NIC, how many heads have rolled till now.

5. The below mentioned link makes for a real sad reading, its not hard for a big spender like Government to hire a few ex-Google,ex-Yahoo! , ex-Amazon folks in India these days to fix web security from the ground up.

If you read the article just shared by me, it mentions that CBI website had SQL injection on their website so can&#8217;t be restored without programming changes. I also underwent another article on Indian National Cyber Security policy which literally made me go into laughter, its available here: <A HREF="http://www.hackerregiment.com/indias-national-cyber-security-policy-or-corporate-information-security-policy.html">http://www.hackerregiment.com/indias-national-cyber-security-policy-or-corporate-information-security-policy.html</A>

If NIC was a hosting company they wouldn't be getting any business for managed services for their legendary incompetence, do they have an SLA to restore stuff in finite time, I mean the napakis hosted their websites in US so understable they were fiddling with ftp to upload stuff from their blazing fast cheaper than India DSL lines, but what sort of 'enterprise' tape drive backups do these folks at NIC use that they can't restore a static website no more than a few megabytes for so long.

Shit happens all the time its the MTTR that matters more. 

India seems to have its fill of incompetent bureaucrats like the ones at CERT-IN  ( where some sweater knitting ladies pick up the official phone mentioned on their website with responses like CERT-IN woh kya hai type answers when you call them up to verify their PGP key fingerprint as recommended on their website )

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 26th November 2010, two years from the dark day for the Indians when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> few Islamic terrorists from Pakistan opened fire at few key public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> places of Mumbai, killing around 175 people and wounding many.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A group of young and enthusiastic Indian hackers, tagged as Indian
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cyber Army (ICA) powered by indishell.in, carried a mass defacement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operation against many public and official websites belonging to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pakistan in order to pay their homage to the martyr of the terrorist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incident. Hacker Regiment sources talked to few hackers belonging to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ICA to understand their modus operandi behind such cyber attacks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jackh4x0r and LuCkY told that most of the group members are already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well settled and earning good money out of their professions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Monetary benefits is not the motivation for any of the group members
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to carry out such cyber attacks, this particular attack was to convey
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a message to the Pakistani citizens on opposing the terror route being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> followed by their nation to disturb neighbours. And 26/11 was the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideal time for conveying this message when our brave soldiers laid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their precious life for the country people&quot; said Jackh4x0r.
