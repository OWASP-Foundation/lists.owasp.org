Annother thing Jack et al,

 

OWASP is never into hacking other sites and will NEVER support such an
activity at any point in time. OWASP is more involved in PROTECTING every
site and making the devlopers of these sites more awartte of security and
making hits a default execution thread in their development process rather
than having security as an exception flow. So, jack et al., please stop
eulogizing yourself and try to do something more beneficial to the community
and to OWASP.

 

Thanks &amp; Regards,

I completely agree with Vinil here. We are just wasting our time defacing
the websites.

 

Wesite defacement is the most simplest of all hacking stuff. By this
defacement what have we acieved?

 

0. Was any confidential/secret documents taken?

1. Is this stopping the activity of the owner of the site and making them
incurr a serious business/economic loss?

2. Does this defacement/vulnerabilty injection really compormise any of the
other sensitive data?

3. What is the effetive loss due to this defacement? Peanuts, is what I
would say.

4. Hacking an enemy site that is not even worth INR 0.0001 paisa is more
like hitting a lame guy who does not even have the strength to hit back. I
am not meaning the Pakistani govt or the Indian govt here. I am speaking
about the other so called 800 sites defaced by the ICA and the 200+ sites
defaced by the pakistanis.

5. This is more of a cowardly act because the sites that we have attacked
mean nothing to us in  most cases.

6. Had we entered in to actual cyber war (a la-Assagne tyoe), that wud have
made the opponent side proud (and equally shaeful for the owner) because
that wud have resulted in a dent in the pride of the opponent. (Please not
that I am not trying to support the Pakistanis here. I am just trying to
look at this from an independent analyser).

7. Why are we having such a big thread for this insignificant issue?

8. I have noticed that no other thread has so many folloups. Is it because
of our natural anethema towartds Paksitanis? Any anti-paki stand by an
Indian raises our flare so much. Dont you this we are wastng our energies
too much on thiese wheil we can do a lot more ot make it better for all?
(Both foir Pakistanis &amp; for Indians?)

9. Dont you think that this list would have benifitted had we discussed
vulnarabilites instad of something like this?

a. After all what is Pakistan ot India, for that matter? It was an integral
prat of India and is just annother land given by nature. It is only man who
has divided and marked the boundaries. Let us leave warfar to our Army
bretheren and let the civilians from both these great countries hold out
their hands to each other and connect better. This will make the world a
better place to live in.

 


Dear OWASPers, lets not waste our time on these trivial matters, Instead let
us concentrate on the real security issues.

Let's take a couple of steps back and start looking at things from a
slightly elevated (pun intended) perspective.

 

1. Website defacement need not be taken at an emotional level - I'd
encourage all of you to do some introspection and ponder that do words like
&quot;shame for the country&quot; have place in a security analyst's vocabulary? For
argument's sake let's say it does - but does it really apply to &quot;website
defacement&quot;, which is one of the lamest acts of publicity mongering - all
hyped up in today's ignorant, publicity scavenging, news hungry environment.


In the physical world, what would you do to graffiti on a building - you'd
wait till the cleaner comes back on Monday and get the chance to clean it
up. You don't have the CEO spending sleepless nights over it - unless of
course he's the cleaner himself. I was going through the CISA and CISSP body
of knowledge and trying to locate the disaster planning/mitigation one
should undertake for graffiti.

 

2.  FWIW, most of these websites are static and host only some public
documents and html marquee tags - which is how they should be ;) If there's
nothing worthwhile, then wasn't the entire exercise in futility? 

 

3. The concept of &quot;if you graffiti my wall - i will graffiti your wall&quot;
(what all these nags and sheshnags and kyabakis are upto) has an
entertainment value but beyond that does it really deserve the time and
bandwidth we are consuming in discussing it. Of course, systems can be
hardened and services like pingdom etc. can be utilized, but that's utopia
:<i>)
</I>
 

4. Addressing the point about (turnover of above 40Crs) - for many
organizations who are new to a process (in this case security review)  it is
a safety mechanism to put in vendor size. That is one way of mitigating
risks, both from a process as well as ability to handle legal liability
point of view. Also, a larger org can rally resources much faster by
throwing money at the problem than a small 10-20 member shop who will be
asking for advance even before the project begins. So, it may not always be
favoritism - it is simply an act of CYA. Credibility helps for small vendors
but when faced with people whose jobs are on the line - they'd rather vote
for their job security than application security ;)

 

5. Another argument I read was about using popular consumer CMS like
wordpress/drupal etc. One of my wordpress sites (duly updated, security
scanned etc.) was susceptible to a mass defacement attack about a few weeks
back using vulnerability in the blog post editor component (the web still
has wrong information on how to fix the issue). My point being: using a
popular cms is not going to fix the problem. 

 

6. Ah! the age old logic: ex-popular company developer can fix it. The
knight in shining armour! Absolute load of whatever. Working at any of the
top software companies IS NOT same as being a good security analyst. Most of
the developers world over (including folks at companies you mentioned) don't
know about secure coding. Show me one good coder with a firm grasp of
security and I can show you millions without! Most guys in the interviews
start waxing eloquent about SQL injection and tell me about their favorite
tools go numb when asked about out of band channeling. Just like any other
field, software is teeming with folks who are in it for the money - which
doesn't guarantee depth of knowledge! In fact, being good at C (which most
of these shops prefer) is inversely proportional to their security quotient.

 

Just let these defacements be line items in your daily news. Don't ponder
too much over it - there are much deeper issues to solve. It is like giving
prime importance to a pimple because it is on your face (which is not quite
pretty to begin with :p ), when your innards are actually decaying.


For each defacement that is reported, I wonder how many compromised servers
running botnets waging a proxy war against your own servers from your own
soil are going unnoticed. (had to put that in - what's an email without some
sensationalism, correct?)

 

Enjoy your Sunday - and remember the wise always said, attachment of any
kind (in life or in email) is not good for you.

Vinil

I have heard this before. More often than not its the large vendors who do
not directly bid, but help establish a tender criteria in which they would
benefit regardless of the implementer.

Since, we pursued few govt. projects available via biddings to public
tenders so I would comment in a complete business centric approach here:

 

Most of such tenders are already fixed before going out to the public and
most of the times, those are prepared by the company, which ultimately wins
at the end. Such are biased tenders with the conditions which can only be
fulfilled only by the company who has prepared it and other capable
companies get automatically rejected from the bidding process.

 

Providing such favours to the company gives personal benefits to the person
at govt. department who is responsible to look after the project. I am
certainly not trying to comment, nor I am aware of how the CBI website
security audit work was provided to the auditor and whether it involved
fixing or not. But it is strange to know that the company which conducted
the audit for CBI website could not find a simple SQL injection, even it
would have been under limited budgets.

 

Just to give away an example: Last week, we met a govt. dept. who wished to
outsource auditing work worth 10L and we were surprised to know that they
kept the condition for the qualification for the bidders who have turnover
of above 40Crs. which makes absolutely no sense and clearly indicates a
biasness.  

 

Apart from setting up other standards and including empanelment process for
the auditors, I think CERT-IN also needs to ensure that for critical work
like InfoSec such qualification criteria should fall under some pre-defined
standards else there would be biased tenders involving corruption, leading
to worthless audit and resulting into shame for the country.

Guys,

Apologies however i beg to differ a bit here. we should also understand
NIC's constraints. They do scan sites for vulnerabilities, however with
limited budget, so that does hurt a bit. I'd still say that it's not
completely NIC's fault. If respective application focals dont fix things on
their end even after seeing high risk issues whom to blame?

 

Govt officials can't really push (ideally they should have the power,
however I doubt if they are delegated that much authority)

 

Again consider the case of shared servers which have poor config because
some legacy application running on it needs FTP/telent! Sucks.... But these
are practical challenges! You can't force the business to go down because of
these hiccups. If you push them harder, believe me you'll find a tough time
justifying your actions. 

 

End result weak server configurations, unpatched and wide open apps invite
people to hack in!

 

Now that something like this is witnessed, I am hoping that folks at NIC can
use this as an opportunity to push respective app focal's and tighten their
security. It's only when brand is tarnished that people take things
seriously! 

 

Hope things change soon.... Fingers crossed!


Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod,

 

Thanks,

Chintan

Your statement makes me worried at multiple levels. 

1. Does nobody do website scanning for user input verification before they
make it live ? I think apart from the contact form there was hardly any
user-input in the whole website ? Close out the user-input related pages and
SQL injection issues go away for a while, the rest of the website can be
back.

2. Why don't they rely on robust open source like wordpress/drupal for
simple content based sites which anyway don't have any useful information.
Atleast the patches get released regularly and can be easily applied.
Ofcourse if they contract out theme building the likelihood is the 90's
style themes would have vulnerabilities built into it by newbies who code
it, there a few things that don't work well with a tendering process and
building web applications is one of them. Otherwise its monstrosities like
the MCA21 website is what it results in at a huge cost to the taxpayers. 

3. What prevents them from putting up a static page that website is being
restored instead of just doing a disappearing act.

4. This is not the first time it has happened to NIC, how many heads have
rolled till now.

5. The below mentioned link makes for a real sad reading, its not hard for a
big spender like Government to hire a few ex-Google,ex-Yahoo! , ex-Amazon
folks in India these days to fix web security from the ground up.

If NIC was a hosting company they wouldn't be getting any business for
managed services for their legendary incompetence, do they have an SLA to
restore stuff in finite time, I mean the napakis hosted their websites in US
so understable they were fiddling with ftp to upload stuff from their
blazing fast cheaper than India DSL lines, but what sort of 'enterprise'
tape drive backups do these folks at NIC use that they can't restore a
static website no more than a few megabytes for so long.

Shit happens all the time its the MTTR that matters more. 

India seems to have its fill of incompetent bureaucrats like the ones at
CERT-IN  ( where some sweater knitting ladies pick up the official phone
mentioned on their website with responses like CERT-IN woh kya hai type
answers when you call them up to verify their PGP key fingerprint as
recommended on their website )
