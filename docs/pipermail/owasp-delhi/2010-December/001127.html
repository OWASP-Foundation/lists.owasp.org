<PRE>Vinil, you are correct at saying that website defacement is not much and is often the work of the lowest in the food chain . But that insight is available to the knowledgeable few. To the rest of the masses whose staple diet is the TV and tabloid journalism, the very fact that CBI's website has been hacked is 'big' news and a 'matter of national shame' (especially if the credit goes to the Pakis). 

Of course some of us are laughing at the report of CBI lodging a case (with itself?) over this defacement.

Let's take a couple of steps back and start looking at things from a slightly elevated (pun intended) perspective. 


1. Website defacement need not be taken at an emotional level - I'd encourage all of you to do some introspection and ponder that do words like &quot;shame for the country&quot; have place in a security analyst's vocabulary? For argument's sake let's say it does - but does it really apply to &quot;website defacement&quot;, which is one of the lamest acts of publicity mongering - all hyped up in today's ignorant, publicity scavenging, news hungry environment. 
In the physical world, what would you do to graffiti on a building - you'd wait till the cleaner comes back on Monday and get the chance to clean it up. You don't have the CEO spending sleepless nights over it - unless of course he's the cleaner himself. I was going through the CISA and CISSP body of knowledge and trying to locate the disaster planning/mitigation one should undertake for graffiti. 


2. FWIW, most of these websites are static and host only some public documents and html marquee tags - which is how they should be ;) If there's nothing worthwhile, then wasn't the entire exercise in futility? 


3. The concept of &quot;if you graffiti my wall - i will graffiti your wall&quot; (what all these nags and sheshnags and kyabakis are upto) has an entertainment value but beyond that does it really deserve the time and bandwidth we are consuming in discussing it. Of course, systems can be hardened and services like pingdom etc. can be utilized, but that's utopia :) 


4. Addressing the point about (turnover of above 40Crs) - for many organizations who are new to a process (in this case security review) it is a safety mechanism to put in vendor size. That is one way of mitigating risks, both from a process as well as ability to handle legal liability point of view. Also, a larger org can rally resources much faster by throwing money at the problem than a small 10-20 member shop who will be asking for advance even before the project begins. So, it may not always be favoritism - it is simply an act of CYA. Credibility helps for small vendors but when faced with people whose jobs are on the line - they'd rather vote for their job security than application security ;) 


5. Another argument I read was about using popular consumer CMS like wordpress/drupal etc. One of my wordpress sites (duly updated, security scanned etc.) was susceptible to a mass defacement attack about a few weeks back using vulnerability in the blog post editor component (the web still has wrong information on how to fix the issue). My point being: using a popular cms is not going to fix the problem. 


6. Ah! the age old logic: ex-popular company developer can fix it. The knight in shining armour! Absolute load of whatever. Working at any of the top software companies IS NOT same as being a good security analyst. Most of the developers world over (including folks at companies you mentioned) don't know about secure coding. Show me one good coder with a firm grasp of security and I can show you millions without! Most guys in the interviews start waxing eloquent about SQL injection and tell me about their favorite tools go numb when asked about out of band channeling. Just like any other field, software is teeming with folks who are in it for the money - which doesn't guarantee depth of knowledge! In fact, being good at C (which most of these shops prefer) is inversely proportional to their security quotient. 


Just let these defacements be line items in your daily news. Don't ponder too much over it - there are much deeper issues to solve. It is like giving prime importance to a pimple because it is on your face (which is not quite pretty to begin with :p ), when your innards are actually decaying. 

For each defacement that is reported, I wonder how many compromised servers running botnets waging a proxy war against your own servers from your own soil are going unnoticed. (had to put that in - what's an email without some sensationalism, correct?) 


Enjoy your Sunday - and remember the wise always said, attachment of any kind (in life or in email) is not good for you.

I have heard this before. More often than not its the large vendors who do not directly bid, but help establish a tender criteria in which they would benefit regardless of the implementer.

Since, we pursued few govt. projects available via biddings to public tenders so I would comment in a complete business centric approach here: 



Most of such tenders are already fixed before going out to the public and most of the times, those are prepared by the company, which ultimately wins at the end. Such are biased tenders with the conditions which can only be fulfilled only by the company who has prepared it and other capable companies get automatically rejected from the bidding process. 



Providing such favours to the company gives personal benefits to the person at govt. department who is responsible to look after the project. I am certainly not trying to comment, nor I am aware of how the CBI website security audit work was provided to the auditor and whether it involved fixing or not. But it is strange to know that the company which conducted the audit for CBI website could not find a simple SQL injection, even it would have been under limited budgets. 



Just to give away an example: Last week, we met a govt. dept. who wished to outsource auditing work worth 10L and we were surprised to know that they kept the condition for the qualification for the bidders who have turnover of above 40Crs. which makes absolutely no sense and clearly indicates a biasness. 



Apart from setting up other standards and including empanelment process for the auditors, I think CERT-IN also needs to ensure that for critical work like InfoSec such qualification criteria should fall under some pre-defined standards else there would be biased tenders involving corruption, leading to worthless audit and resulting into shame for the country.

Guys, 


Apologies however i beg to differ a bit here. we should also understand NIC's constraints. They do scan sites for vulnerabilities, however with limited budget, so that does hurt a bit. I'd still say that it's not completely NIC's fault. If respective application focals dont fix things on their end even after seeing high risk issues whom to blame? 






Govt officials can't really push (ideally they should have the power, however I doubt if they are delegated that much authority) 





Again consider the case of shared servers which have poor config because some legacy application running on it needs FTP/telent! Sucks.... But these are practical challenges! You can't force the business to go down because of these hiccups. If you push them harder, believe me you'll find a tough time justifying your actions. 






End result weak server configurations, unpatched and wide open apps invite people to hack in! 






Now that something like this is witnessed, I am hoping that folks at NIC can use this as an opportunity to push respective app focal's and tighten their security. It's only when brand is tarnished that people take things seriously! 






Hope things change soon.... Fingers crossed! 



Sorry for brevity, sent from my iPod, 






Thanks, 


Chintan

Your statement makes me worried at multiple levels. 

1. Does nobody do website scanning for user input verification before they make it live ? I think apart from the contact form there was hardly any user-input in the whole website ? Close out the user-input related pages and SQL injection issues go away for a while, the rest of the website can be back. 

2. Why don't they rely on robust open source like wordpress/drupal for simple content based sites which anyway don't have any useful information. Atleast the patches get released regularly and can be easily applied. Ofcourse if they contract out theme building the likelihood is the 90's style themes would have vulnerabilities built into it by newbies who code it, there a few things that don't work well with a tendering process and building web applications is one of them. Otherwise its monstrosities like the MCA21 website is what it results in at a huge cost to the taxpayers. 

3. What prevents them from putting up a static page that website is being restored instead of just doing a disappearing act. 

4. This is not the first time it has happened to NIC, how many heads have rolled till now. 

5. The below mentioned link makes for a real sad reading, its not hard for a big spender like Government to hire a few ex-Google,ex-Yahoo! , ex-Amazon folks in India these days to fix web security from the ground up.

If you read the article just shared by me, it mentions that CBI website had SQL injection on their website so can&#8217;t be restored without programming changes.

If NIC was a hosting company they wouldn't be getting any business for managed services for their legendary incompetence, do they have an SLA to restore stuff in finite time, I mean the napakis hosted their websites in US so understable they were fiddling with ftp to upload stuff from their blazing fast cheaper than India DSL lines, but what sort of 'enterprise' tape drive backups do these folks at NIC use that they can't restore a static website no more than a few megabytes for so long. 

Shit happens all the time its the MTTR that matters more. 

India seems to have its fill of incompetent bureaucrats like the ones at CERT-IN ( where some sweater knitting ladies pick up the official phone mentioned on their website with responses like CERT-IN woh kya hai type answers when you call them up to verify their PGP key fingerprint as recommended on their website )
