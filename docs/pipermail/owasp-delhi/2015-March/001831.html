1) Connector is just lying there and not attached to one of the little squares on the entity. Do that and your error will go away.

2) You need to understand the trust boundaries first. You might be using some external connector such as browser which might be communicating with a server and you're putting them in one trust boundary. Separate them with a boundary, this warning will go away.

Regarding references, refer Threat Modelling book by Snyder or another book by Adam Shostock.

Thanks,
Pankaj

Hi Folks,



Has anyone worked on Microsoft Threat Modeling tool 2014 version? We couldn't find any documentation on tool features . For e.g. what each type of Stencil is all about, etc. We are trying to build an application threat model . However, the tool gives out a lot of generic errors and warnings and we couldn't find any supporting documentation to help resolve those.



Sample Errors and Warnings:-



The connector is not attached to stencils in a close proximity. Error   Diagram 1       True

External interactor should communicate over trust boundary.     Warning Diagram 1       True



Attached TMTGettingStartedGuide.docx doesn't explain tool features in detail.  Any suggestions would be of great help. Thanks in advance.



Kind Regards,

Archana
