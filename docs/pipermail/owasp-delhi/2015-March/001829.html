Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] Regarding Microsoft Threat Modeling tool 2014

Hi Folks,



Has anyone worked on Microsoft Threat Modeling tool 2014 version? We couldn't find any documentation on tool features . For e.g. what each type of Stencil is all about, etc. We are trying to build an application threat model . However, the tool gives out a lot of generic errors and warnings and we couldn't find any supporting documentation to help resolve those.



Sample Errors and Warnings:-



The connector is not attached to stencils in a close proximity. Error Diagram 1 True

Suman:&#160;
For each block there is a limited connecting points&#8206; which u can see as dot points.. so when u r connecting one block to other..both should be connected on their dot points.&#160;

External interactor should communicate over trust boundary. Warning Diagram 1 True

Suman:&#160;

In this case you have not created a trust boundary..so lets say if u have webserver hosted behind firewall then u have to create a trust boundary between external user block diagram and webserver.. and webserver should be inside the trust boundaries. &#160;

Attached TMTGettingStartedGuide.docx doesn't explain tool features in detail. Any suggestions would be of great help. Thanks in advance.



Kind Regards,

Archana
