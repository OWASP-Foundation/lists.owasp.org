<PRE>1. If you are building an &quot;interesting&quot; site with a decent amount of traffic, 
your pages will become part of the &quot;package&quot; - how much additional work would it 
be? I have websites whose input forms haven't been updated for years now. That's 
a regular product life cycle -giving the spammer a lot of time to tweak his tool

2. Anyway, a lot of users I know use the browser's autofill profiles feature. 
Some of them also use extensions such as lastpass - and they work in a similar 
way i.e. by scanning the html for INPUT fields and filling them appropriately.
When they visit the sire, the users will see the browser showing the yellow bar 
saying your form profile has been autofilled, which will confuse the users 
because they don't see a valid input on the screen. Also, they might become vary 
about visiting your site because it'd appear as if you are harvesting 
information without their knowledge.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Re-considering CAPTCHAs


Hi all,
 
Hope you are doing well.
 
So there was this thread on CAPTCHAs on Security focus lately and I happened 
to read this new idea on CAPTCHA. This is what he said.
 
&quot;I hate captchas, always have so I use a reverse captcha on sites that I build. 
You add a field to the form with name and id of email. You then give it a label 
that says &quot;Please leave blank&quot; and hide them both with CSS. Most people won't 
see them because the CSS works, even if they do see them they read the message 
and obey. Spam engines on the other hand spot the email field and happily fill 
it in. You then silently drop any contact forms with values in the email field.&quot;
 
Just wanted to know your opinion on this. How did you find this idea of tricking 
spammers? I am concerned about this idea because of the easiness of its 
implementation. But there can be concerns regarding customization of bot 
softwares depending on the individual forms with such implementations. What else 
do you have in mind?
