OSSIM is more into monitoring like SIEM, though only money saver and not too
appealing. Just a combination of all those open source tools.

 

NIPPER for technical findings and Manual review for logical findings can be
a good option. Nipper has become commercial tool lately and need to download
their older free version.

Any inputs from your side.
