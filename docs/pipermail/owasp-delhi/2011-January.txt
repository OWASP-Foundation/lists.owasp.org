it is also possible that the computer is turned off, or does not
have a mail system running right now.

Your message was not delivered within 3 days:

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Interpretation of IIS log

Hi All,

I need some views on these IIS logs:

The issues/concerns are:

1.       172.16.5.55 is the NATed IP of www.xyz.com<http://www.xyz.com> : Is it possible to receive referrals from www.xyz.com<http://www.xyz.com> to its own NATed IP? If yes, under what circumstances would that be possible? The IPs and domains are masked for confidentiality.

2.       www.xyz.com<http://www.xyz.com> does not have any files in PHP. It is a  purely ASP based server. We have checked the source code. How can a  there be a request from a  server with no PHP files on it, refer to its own NATed IP and try and access files e.g. as evident in the logs - loginbox.gif or getimage.php which are not present on the system. Or is it possible to make the server generate this kind of request by exploiting some vulnerability?



Can this be part of some kind of attack?


Really stumped on the possibilities. There seems to be no logic derivable.

Would really appreciate the fraternity's expert views.

Regards,

Digvijay Singh Shekhawat

Hi all,

Hope you are doing well.

So there was this thread on CAPTCHAs on Security focus lately and I happened
to read this new idea on CAPTCHA. This is what he said.

"I hate captchas, always have so I use a reverse captcha on sites that I
build. You add a field to the form with name and id of email. You then give
it a label that says "Please leave blank" and hide them both with CSS. Most
people won't see them because the CSS works, even if they do see them they
read the message and obey. Spam engines on the other hand spot the email
field and happily fill it in. You then silently drop any contact forms with
values in the email field."

Just wanted to know your opinion on this. How did you find this idea of
tricking spammers? I am concerned about this idea because of the easiness of
its implementation. But there can be concerns regarding customization of bot
softwares depending on the individual forms with such implementations. What
else do you have in mind?

*1. I think this point is valid even if you deploy full-fledge CAPTCHAs.
CAPTCHA deployed today could be exploitable a year later or may be earlier.*
**
*2. What if I use Auto-complete feature to turn-off the same, thereby
compromising user-convenience against Security?

Hi Gunwant,
This method is good for a run-of-a-mill bots. The bots which simply scans
webpages for comments form and submit their spammy link ther filling all the
details asked. so yes you can make a plugin for off-the-shelf
CMS(WP/Drupal/Joomla) by this way. "A non intrusive spam protection"

But that's not what all the bot do, rather people customize bots as per web
pages to exploit the features.
Say a bot for web services like cbl.abuseat.org or iptools.com. Even for non
standard comments page like one at blogoscoped.com

In any such case where a script is modified for the target webpage, this won't work

thanks
./Rohit11

1. If you are building an "interesting" site with a decent amount of traffic, 
your pages will become part of the "package" - how much additional work would it 
be? I have websites whose input forms haven't been updated for years now. That's 
a regular product life cycle -giving the spammer a lot of time to tweak his tool

2. Anyway, a lot of users I know use the browser's autofill profiles feature. 
Some of them also use extensions such as lastpass - and they work in a similar 
way i.e. by scanning the html for INPUT fields and filling them appropriately.
When they visit the sire, the users will see the browser showing the yellow bar 
saying your form profile has been autofilled, which will confuse the users 
because they don't see a valid input on the screen. Also, they might become vary 
about visiting your site because it'd appear as if you are harvesting 
information without their knowledge.
