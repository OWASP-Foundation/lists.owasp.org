Armorize has a tool called SecureCode that can be used for scanning PHP code as well...And of course Fortify.

Rightly said Venki.  With slight correction here, tool name is CodeSecure
and mistakenly named as SecureCode. Our company works with Armorize to get
its products penetrated into Indian markets and CodeSecure details are
available at: http://torridnet.com/codesecure-security-code-review-engine.
Though, I already shared the details with Vaibhav offline but re-posting to

Hi Arun,

 

    No need to correct you, I think devInspect doesn't support PHP in
it's current version. I heard from somebody else that latest version of
Devinspect supports PHP, that's why I posted it.

 

Anyways, Fortify SCA supports PHP.

And there is another free tool  PHP-Sat.

Hi Paramendra!

 

   There has been two presentation so far on SSL broken in various conferences worldwide.

 

The latest was in BlackHat where SSL was broken exploiting flaws in a filed of the certificate issued by a CA(root/intermediary).

 

But the topic posted on OWASP delhi was in context of SSL broken using MD5 collision.

Hackers created rogue CA certificate using md5 collision in CCC (Chaos Communication Congress), Germany.

You can see the presentation here..

 

http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/md5-collisions-1.0.ppt

 

Hope that helps!

Nilesh

Hi Parmendra,

 

There has been a tool comparison done by Larry, the report can be found here
http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20071014/web-application-scanning-depth-statistics/
. The problem with Black box testing is that it cannot really show all the
vulnerabilities that are inherent in an application, nor can anybody
quantify how much of testing has been done on the application. Thus, leaving
an application vulnerable, post- testing. An inside out approach is what is
required to assure that all paths have been tested. A solution like Fortify
PTA earlier known as Fortify Tracer provides deeper insight into application
testing. Of course you can't do away with black box vulnerability assessment
solutions as they are the only way to find infrastructure based
vulnerabilities. There is also a report in the ISACA' Information System
Control Journal (Vol 6. 2008) on black box testing statistics which would
help you decide in choosing a solution. 

 

Thanks and regards

Maheshan

Thanks for the input Lava and Venkat.

To answer you question Venkat the cookie will contain a test variable
to check whether or not cookies are enabled. Beside that we could
include some random variable which would be required beside user name
and password. This could be used for counting the number of attempts.

We are using RDBMS at the backend. What Lava suggests makes sense that
we count the number of failed logins on the basis of username and
prompt with a captcha after X number of fails.

 Dear Sameer;

I think you used cookies values for counting the number of attempts to 
prevent from brute force attack which should not be the best 
practices.Still the brute force attack possible by changing the cookie 
value.
Lava suggestion make sense.

Robin Tiwari

Yes that is very much true. There are OCR readers which can decipher the CAPTCH texts. In fact, Yahoo was the first to use the CAPTCHA technique. But after that, the OCR scanners were used to decipher the CAPTCHA texts. In order to avoid this deciphering, CAPTCHA tools are now making sure that the images are more distorted and that the background has more noise (like lines and arcs with darker color so that the distortion increases because of the background graphics). But, nevertheless, the fundamental rule to remember is that CAPTCHA is breakable over time ? both audio & video CAPTCHAs I mean.

 

A new dimension to CAPTCHA would be to understand the audience. If you feel that the audience are smart and intelligent, u can generate random questions that are either simple mathematical or are questions in the context of the users company (in case of interla employees). Generally, you should never have a database of questions define for CAPTCHA as that wud defeat the purpose of CAPTCHA. If you are targetting audiences who are of different kind, then u still have to sticke to the conventional CAPTCHA requirement.

 

Hope this answers your question.

Some thoughts:


0. Are u going to encrypt the contents of the cookie? Because if u r having the number of attempts etc in the cookie, they could be modified by anyone.
1. Are you planning to have the captcha text within the cookie? If so, that?s a bad idea.
2. The normal rule in general is that the user account needs to be locked after some predefined number of invalid attempts. If the account is not locked, you are only increasing the scope for trying out still different passwords. This will give the attacker to try breaking in even after several attempts. Instead of that, you can flag the account for locking and disabling. That will at least try to prevent an unauthorized entry into the system
3. I would not still suggest CAPTCHA & re-login after X attempts as you are giving the attacker more chance to meddle around with the system.

Thanks for the input Lava and Venkat.

To answer you question Venkat the cookie will contain a test variable
to check whether or not cookies are enabled. Beside that we could
include some random variable which would be required beside user name
and password. This could be used for counting the number of attempts.

We are using RDBMS at the backend. What Lava suggests makes sense that
we count the number of failed logins on the basis of username and
prompt with a captcha after X number of fails.

How does this sound? - Lock the account after 3 invalid attempts and auto unlock the account at 0000hrs.

Hi Parmendra,

    Sorry for being late...mail me on my office-id to get quicker response..
:)



-> While scanning a website you get a bulk of vulnerabilities (low, medium,
high). So how do u manage to avoid false positives as going manually for
each and every field is a huge task. Is there any Threat Modelling Tool used
for this.

As far as I am concerned, I do manual test for each and every false
positives as far as possible. Sometimes your experience helps you that
whether there is real vulnerability existing or not. I have not used any
Threat Modelling tool. But yes some exist..one from Microsoft...google it.
But good scannig tools tends to do deliever less false positives. To be on
safer side...test as many vulnerabilities as you can. Also while testing you
came to knew that on the particular place..it's only false positives.

 -> Also, while testing a website offline(using Dump of website) a lot of

> Yes..that's true. But how can you check the server response then if website

Hope This helps...any query just revert back to me or post to the OWASP

adopted for WAP sites are different in any way from those adopted for
regular sites.

2. Also, is MySQL the best (in terms of both security and usage) RDBMS with
context to PHP web sites or there are better options?

Hi  Parmendra,

 

    CSRF attack is executed on behalf of a user?s authentication in an application. If the application?s user authentication mechanism relies on sessionID only ,it can be vulnerable to CSRF attack.

For an application to not be vulnerable, it must include session-related information in the URL ,other than sessionID, in a form of unidentifiable or unpredictable by the user.

 

Referring to your scenario, if an attacker sends an HTML page in e-mail to a user and lures him to click the link, the action is performed on behalf of him.

 Or simply mails to the user 

<img src="http://mybank.com/transferamount?toacc=26617771011&amount=10000000">

Now whenever the page containing the above link loads it will make request to the mybank?s server and perform the request to transfer the specified amount to acc no 26617771011 on behalf of logged in user?s authentication. The attacker never comes into the picture.

For more sophisticated attacks:

<img src=http://mybank.com/transferamount?toacc=26617771011&amount=10000000 <http://mybank.com/transferamount?toacc=26617771011&amount=10000000>  height:?0? width:?0?>

 

For testing purpose:

1.       Be sure that the application is relying on single token authentication mechanism.

2.       Make any HTML page containing a vulnerable link as above and send to the user.

3.       Entice the user to click it, if the request is fulfilled, the application is vulnerable to CSRF.

 

 Hope this helps?

 

For more expert comments post it to OWASP mailing list.

Dear Sir,

 

May i know how do you test for the CSRF vulnerabilty manually in Web Applications. Taking the scenerio that a user gets a malicious URL within the email laced with the attack using <img src> tag. 

Should we have to embeed an image within the mail and point it to the target application URL. Please suggest how do we do this.

Message-ID: <709491.90743.qm@web54306.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Context:
XSS issue; where end users inject JavaScript and access a service (within the same domain) and can gain access to information that is supposed to be restricted to that "User" only.
?
Quick fix solution: Put the restricted page on a separate Sub-Domain. (On many browers this limits the ability of javaScript functions to read)
?
Issue: On some experimentation, a person can still maek an AJAX call via the original script injected page to across domains.
Q) Which all browser + version dont Allow it!
Q) Given for now that we cannot black list/filter the javascript being inserted; how can we protect a page from being accessed by other pages injected with JavaScript in the same main domain.
?
Thanks,
Arjun

I think there is some confusion here.

Isn't XSS used to bypass same origin policy and load malicious script
from another domain?

May be you can refine the first paragraph "XSS Issue". It seems we are
not on the same page.

Hello Arjun,

I still think its not clear!

You are talking about injecting Ajax requests using javascript calls.
Fine, but what would you gain by doing so?
You are still calling some xyz page that resides on the same server
and same domain!

I don't see it a point.

Coming to your questions.
1) Which all browser + version dont Allow it!

Ans: Why would a browser restrict AJAX call? It sounds weird to me in
the first place. All browsers (or user agents) follow RFC. It makes no
difference to them whether a human is making an ajax request or a
script is making the same request on behalf of user.

2) Given for now that we cannot black list/filter the javascript being
inserted; how can we protect a page from being accessed by other pages
injected with JavaScript in the same main domain.

Ans: Are you clear on what you want? May be you might want to do some
research first and then post. Apologies, but i don't really the
question.

I think there is some confusion here.

Isn't XSS used to bypass same origin policy and load malicious script
from another domain?

May be you can refine the first paragraph "XSS Issue". It seems we
are
not on the same page.

Hello Friends,

Are there any open source implementation for "Web Application Firewall"..??

I googled and found http://www.modsecurity.org/ but looks too complex
to be implemented.

I am looking for something that can be configured on Production Web
Servers where I'm using Apache HTTPD & Apache Tomcat. Thanks!

Thanks

Thanks for the link Dhruv, didnt know about it, will check it out.
You are a pretty resourceful guy I must say ;)

Piyush,
Mod-security is the most popular OS/free WAF around.
It not really that hard to set-up, install it as an Apache module, 
configure apache to act in proxy mode and you are almost there.
Not that hard to do, just takes sometime and googling, there are plenty of 
tutorials available online which explain the steps clearly.
Get the help of your Apache administrator.

There is a lot happening with mod-sec, stuff like virtual-patching are 
gaining momentum, you dont want to miss the fun do you???

There is a large spread of JS based malware which is being dished out  
by web servers all over the world. I am not sure if this is the same  
one you are refering to, but the one I am familiar with is the one  
which performs redirection using crafted JS which is embedded in each  
and every web page on the server. I would recommend people who have  
dynamic and changing web content to look carefully at the script tags  
in all web pages and weed out this trend.

Hi Tarun,

 

Searching directly godrejindia.com displays godrejindia.com as link and there?s a message ? This site may harm you? which is marked by Google when there?s some malicious content detected. 

 

But there was an incident few weeks back that due to internal technical problems of Google it was mistakenly referring each and every website as  ? Harmful to visit? -- even Gmail J--

 

But I can?t confirm this is the same or not.

Anyways, what exactly your firebug console is reporting?

Hi Parmendra,

 

    As far as I have used this tool, it?s self explanatory tool. Just download it, load the HTML file which basically contains javascript codes to perform encoding, decoding, conversion, cheat sheets and other various handy tools under one umbrella. Very useful tool. 

So use it to learn it.

Hi Tarun,

 

Site is definitely infected by some malicious code. Somebody has uploaded
Trojan on the server which is causing a download of some Activex on the
client. Usually in such type of cases, Server administrator should look for
some umwanted .vbs and .bat file on the server and try to delete them
immediately. After this they should send a request to Google for the
reconsideration of the site

Nilesh,

I think that was an mistake on google's part, which was soon rectified, as
it made news headlines within no time. If I am not wrong, the mistake was in
filtering content based on the regular expression.

By mistake they replaced backward slash with forward as a result of which
all the url's ending with "/" were considered malicious.

I do not remember things exactly, so excuse me if there is something
factually incorrect somewhere.

Chintan,

 

   Even I am missing what had happened actually.  But something like this had occurred with Google that day.

 

Thanks,

Nilesh

But there was an incident few weeks back that due to internal technical problems of Google it was mistakenly referring each and every website as  ? Harmful to visit? -- even Gmail J--

 

But I can?t confirm this is the same or not.

Anyways, what exactly your firebug console is reporting?

Hi,

Looks like godrejindia.com is serving malware right from the frontpage according to my firebug console. Comments from experts ?. Google doesn't seem to return the results for godrejindia.com when searching for keywords godrej india anymore only when searches for godrejindia.com directly.

Thanks
-Tarun
