Hello everyone,
I'm Minhaz 3rd Sem B-tech Computer Engineering Delhi Technological
University, New Delhi. I have been working with OWASP on PHP Security
Project with Abbas Naderi as our mentor. I was not much aware of OWASP
India having its section in Delhi/Noida till last few weeks.
I wonder if there is going to be any conference in upcoming days, and also
I'd be glad if someone could help me with how to get into these
conferences. I'd also love to learn about projects members from India are
working upon.

Thanks

Minhaz
