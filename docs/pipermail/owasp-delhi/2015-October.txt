ISO SC 27 Event in Jaipur



Dear Members,



Greetings!



We are glad to announce that DSCI in collaboration with the Bureau of
Indian Standards (BIS) will be hosting the ISO/IEC/JTC1 SC27 Working Groups
meeting in Jaipur next month (*October 26-30*). This key set of Working Groups
is meeting in India for the first time. Around 300 global experts from
Industry, Governments and Academic Institutions would gather to deliberate
on forging international standards on *Security, Privacy, Risk Management
and Supply Chain Security. *Specialised domains such as Cloud and IoT, will
also be taken up, along with updating of a few existing standards and
generating ideas on the crucial areas on which Security and Privacy
Standards are required but do not exist yet. For example, in the last
meeting held in Malaysia, a security standard for the Aviation Industry,
following the MH 370 incident, was proposed and will be deliberated in
Jaipur*.* The complete list of standards (developed and ongoing) under SC27
can be found at:
http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=45306&published=on&development=on



As you will appreciate, ISO standards are sooner or later adopted by the
organizations ? both by developers of Technology and Practitioners - some
enforceable by clients and some become de-facto standards for operations.
Thus, the chance to contribution to standard development process is a
strategic opportunity, apart from providing long term networking
situations. This meeting presents a great opportunity for us to leverage
experience and expertise of Indian software professionals in Security and
Privacy and demonstrate our thought leadership in this domain. With *Prime
Minister Mr. Narendra Modi highlighting the strategic importance of cyber
security *on numerous occasions? cyber security has emerged as a strategic
area, with greenfield business potential for Indian companies.



Indian participation, up till now, has been rather limited in ISO SC27 and
similar platforms over the years. Only a handful of companies including
Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Tata Communication and Polaris had participated in the
previous rounds of meetings. Given the dominant size of the Indian IT
industry, contributing to these standards and demonstrating capability is
of vital importance. There is also the reverse benefit of peer learning
from global experts. Participants will be able to cite this experience in
their resumes and enhance their professional profiles.



Details on various working groups within SC27, standards under development
can be found in attached presentation. DSCI is coordinating Industry
participation and will submit details to BIS for enrolling in ISO global
directory. It may be noted that the Indian contingent participants will be
representing India and will not be there in their individual capacity. We
request member organizations to nominate subject matter experts from their
organization for participating in the Working group meetings. Participation
is free of charge. Participants are expected to attend all the five days in
the WG meetings. The nomination(s) should come from the Security/ IT/
Vertical head. *Please share nomination details in the following format,
latest by 5 October*.

Copies of resumes of the nominated participants, including the relevant
professional accomplishments, may also be attached to the nomination mail.
A briefing call will be held for all the nominees tentatively on 7 October.

DSCI is looking for industry support for hosting this conference, and
making this event a success. The working group meetings will conclude on
Friday, 30 Oct  and will be followed by a half day open conference with
panel discussions and keynotes on standards where industry members other
than Working Group members can also participate. Organization willing to
join as sponsor for this initiatives are also welcome.



Please write to Rahul Sharma (rahul.sharma at dsci.in) or call him at +*91
