<PRE>The attack so far appears to be a DNS attack.  The attack happened at the domain name registrar's end, which is Network Solutions in this case of TCS. Network Solutions is one of the top five domain name registrars on internet, managing almost 6.4 million domains.

If this is repeat attack, then, this seems to be serious and it seems twitter kind of attack which happened few weeks back.

Also as DNS servers are targeted, it would be interesting to know whether the servers were owned by TCS or third party. If it was third party then this attack might have affected other companies as well, if its TCS then there will be serious questions of security measures from their side, as it will affect their reputation badly

The repeat of this attack might mean the attack might have been planned and targeted, guess more information will be unfolded in coming days

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] [Owasp-Mumbai] TCS.com -- something wrong.

As per Dhruv:

&gt;&gt;<i> The IP address that was resolving against the domain during
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>compromised period was: 205.178.152.154 and now after restoration its:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>216.15.200.140. So not really network/application attack but DNS/account
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>compromise.
</I>
The site is again under attack.
The IP of TCS.com is again back to compromised one: 205.178.152.154
The tcs.com&lt;<A HREF="http://tcs.com">http://tcs.com</A>&gt; displays the following message:

&quot;This Domain name is for sale. Please contact us:
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-delhi">abed_uk at hotmail.com</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-delhi">abed_uk at hotmail.com</A>&gt;

Looks like DNS attack only.
