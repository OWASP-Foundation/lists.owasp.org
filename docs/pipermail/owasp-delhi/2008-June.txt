Hi All,

 

Let me introduce myself to all the members of the OWASP Delhi Chapter. I
am Gunwant Singh, working in Noida (NCR) as a security consultant.

I have been attached with application security and OWASP for quite a
while although I registered to this particular chapter recently. It
gives me immense pleasure to be a part of OWASP and I am sure we will
take this chapter to new heights.

 

I have a few concerns if someone is willing to answer. Is there any
timely meeting of the members of this chapter, if yes then can I have
the details. 

Moreover, is this mailing list also meant to be as a platform to share
knowledge and/or ask questions for bolstering one's knowledge?

 

Thank you all.

 

Regards.

Thanks Jitesh and absolutely right said!! We invited Jeremiah for this event
and he was very keen to come down but unfortunately, he couldn't make it
this time. Otherwise, we would have also got a chance to meet the blog owner
:-)

 

Conference recordings will be available at the will of the speaker to
redistribute. But recording the training session might bring obligation on
OWASP to ensure that recordings are not redistributed b'coz training
material will include proprietary documents/research data of the trainer.
So, we will refrain ourselves from getting the training sessions recorded.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Hi All,

I was testing one of the application last night. The issue I am going to describe is nothing new to me but I was concerned about this for a long time and I did not get any chance to ask this before.

While testing the application against CSRF attack, I noticed that it is vulnerable to CSRF attack only if it is tested via. another tab of the same browser. However, if I test the application via.  different browser it does not work. 

This is how I tested:
I logged in to the application. I coded an html page with an image tag with source as the logout URL. (<img src="www.application.com/logout.php">). I sent this link to my email (just to make the scenario look real). I clicked on the link, it opened in the same browser in a different tab and I   got logged out of the application. However, if I use another browser window to open the URL, it did not work.

So, I wanted to know that how high is this risk and is there any way I can show that the application is also vulnerable by using different browser. Any suggestions/opinions will be highly appreciated.

Thank you.
Gunwant Singh.

CSRF (also known as one-click attack) relies on user's logged on credentials.

This is how it works:

1. Victim logs on to his online banking website. Assume he used Firefox for this

2. There is a malicious website which when opened in browser
automatically transfers money from victim's account to attacker's
account.

3. Victim opens the malicious link in the same Firefox instance, as a
new tab (or may be even a new firefox window. Haven't tested this one
so far). WHEN THE MALICIOUS WEBSITE INVOKES THE BANK URL FOR MONEY
TRANSFER, BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY SENDS VICTIM'S COOKIES. The attack
works!

or

3. Victim opens the malicious link in IE. WHEN THE MALICIOUS WEBSITE
INVOKES THE BANK URL FOR MONEY TRANSFER, BROWSER HAS NO COOKIES TO
SEND FOR BANK TO AUTHENTICATE THE VICTIM. The attack fails!

If you wish to understand this in more detail download and try Hackme
Casino from Foundstone website. I'm posting a video on CSRF soon on my
Blog, you can keep an RSS feed with you for update.

Hope this helps!

Hi,

Thanks for your opinion but that did not answer my question.
I know how it works, I have tested dozen applications but what I wanted to know in the first place in short is that if an application is vulnerable to CSRF which has already been tested via. different tab of the same browser - Is there a way I can show that the application is also vulnerable by using different browser and not the same instance of the same browser.

Regards.

Hi Gunwant,

>From what you have elucidated here, I would say that this is a valid case of
CSRF and tabbed-browsing has greatly increased the potency of such attacks.
Now, on your second question - you can not exploit it over a completely
different browser instance. In fact, you can't even exploit it over a second
instance of Firefox. Still, the vulnerability can be deemed as high-risk.

Lotsa Singhs on the thread can break it :)

Best,
Pukhraj

I guess NO. Unless the browser has your valid cookies CSRF will fail.
That would be the case with DIFFERENT browser. SAME browser I have not
tested yet.

The attack success would depend on usage pattern of the victim. It
nevertheless is a high risk issue. From my experience folks use tabs a
lot these days.

Hope I answered your question this time

Thanks Bishan,

Yeah that's what I thought of. Since the Session cookies will not be
valid in case a different browser is used, the attack will fail. I have
noticed this scenario in case of Firefox, Opera and IE7, though lower
versions of IE are vulnerable. I think that's kind of additional
security these browser guys have provided.

Thanks for your help.

Cheers.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Reg. CSRF
In-Reply-To: <eee174420806242002k395cb721md8e0608ee46a4b69@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <277613.73294.qm@web53207.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi Gunwant,

As far as my knowledge goes, the cookies of one browser instance are available to another instance of the same browser. For example, if you login to your yahoo mail account from once browser instance, say Firefox and then attempt to browse to mail.yahoo.com from another instance, not tab, of Firefox, you'll notice that you are automatically logged in to your account (if the session is still active).

Therefore, i feel that if you are able to exploit CSRF through a tab, you'll be able to achieve the same through another instance of the same browser as well. Further, regarding the risk of CSRF, i'm sure you know that it depends on the context and the exploit vector. If the greatest damage you can do through this is just logging a user out of this session then it's not such a big risk, although it would be a security issue. On the other hand, if you are able to modify/update his details or perform some key action on his behalf, then that would be a risk to worry about.

I hope i've answered your question.

Regards
Harish

Hi all,

 

I am back again with a question. Thank you for your support so far.

While testing, I have come to know that I am running out of exploits.
Since administrators are coming up with latest patches to cover up the
existing vulnerabilities, one must also update his/her exploit
collection w.r.t the vulnerabilities found. I have a collection of some
exploits which are mostly for web servers (IIS, Apache, etc.). Just
wanted to know, what resources you guys use to get the exploits, or you
build your own. I m looking for both network based and application based
exploits. May be if someone wants to share some exploits or links for
any resources. Any feedback will be highly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Gunwant Singh

I do not carry my own list. It's just too much. I rely on following :

1. Securiteam

2. SecurityForest

3. Red Base Security

4. PacketStorm Security

5. SecurityFocus

6. Metasploit

7. Milw0rm User Link

Additionally there are sites that offer paid exploits. Some offer
0-day exploits too. Moreover the shift you notice is not new. These
days almost all update patches and stuff. Issues are generally in the
configuration or layer 7, which is your web app.

Hi,
just search in google for XSS cheat sheet or SQL injection cheat sheet u will get some good links.
http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html?is one good site, this site has exploits for major vulnerablities .
?
hope this helps.
?

Greetings Gunwant,

 

Good to see you back in action!! As you have already got few good responses
against your query, so I won't reiterate the known theory here. But I would
certainly like to participate in this thread. 

 

How would you know that you are running out of exploits? Do you see, there
have been numerous vulnerabilities published on the internet/non-disclosure
channels or transferred via IRC/contacts/pre-published advisories to your
knowledge these days, at fast pace than expected? If you rely on published
vulnerabilities, and if administrators have fixed those vulnerabilities by
applying the patches then you have no option but to wait for administrators
to commit yet another mistake (I am sure, they do care for security
auditors/attackers to have some fun with the company resources :-) ). Even
if not, you would still find numbers of servers on the wild available,
un-patched for MS03/04/05-00X vulnerability and tons of IIS/Apache servers
those are vulnerable to old time attacks. Don't be surprised if I say that
during a recent pen-test assignment, we found MS02-018 vulnerability in a
live web server for some reputed and well known company (obviously, can't
disclose the name of client to avoid making you jump out of your chair).
Seems to be funny, ain't it? But, welcome to India!!! Lot of effort is still
required to make the community know the risk of hosting vulnerable resources
to wild wild web (www). There are still lots of reputed websites those are
running with information disclosure vulnerability (no exploit needed, hah!),
where the available information is worth few bucks, if not million
dollars!!! I don't run/promote any shop in a Nehru Place though :-)

 

Network based attacks could vary due to variety of architectures available
today, so gathering good amount of standalone exploits for every
architecture would be a tough job and hence, we can rely on known tools like
metasploit/coreimpact those have almost all (If not all, then many) variants
of known exploit codes with options to inject shell codes of your choice.
Along with this, there are others web resources to standalone exploits and
those have already been mentioned in earlier replies to your query, there
could ofcourse be lot more those you could hit at. I used to maintain a list
of exploit links when I used to work as a security researcher, but I have
not used these links from ages (may be from past 4yrs) so am not sure how
many of those links still work, so excuse me if none of those work for you.
But anyhow, I have pasted those links next to my signatures. 

 

For application based exploits, it is already been said that cheat sheets +
fuzzer works far better than relying on collection of exploit codes. Refer
to old HD Moore's style of writing a small fuzzer, where he could find more
than 50 flaws in Internet Explorer :-) (I love Microsoft for increasing
employment for malware/security researchers/attackers.) Application based
attacks are mostly driven due to functional + technical faults, and can
mostly be observed by humans rather than automated exploit framework/tools.
Finding variants for application based attacks is far easier coz all
programmers can't think alike and can't think of delivering secure code
every time coz their companies teach them for delivering functional code,
both for clients and attackers :-)

 

Hope helps!

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv
