<PRE>Hi Everyone,

There is a possible 0-day that I would like to test on Web Application 
Firewalls.

I currently dont have access to one so its still a theory.

If someone has an ASP.NET application running behind any Web Application 
Firewall in your environment or else where then kindly let me know.

I can promise you it would be really intresting and completely safe ;)

Send me a private message if you would like to keep it under wraps.


Thanks and Regards,
Lavakumar K
