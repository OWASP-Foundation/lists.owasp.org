<PRE>Hi Gunwant,

&gt;<i> Fyi, even SHA-1 is susceptible to collision attacks. Practically even if
</I>MD5
&gt;<i> or SHA-1 are broken, this vulnerability still can't be readily used to
</I>exploit the certificate genuinity uptil 'Now'

Absolutely, I completely agree with your point that SHA-1 is susceptible
to collisions.

The only difference between them is that colliding SHA-1 still a
mathematical probability of 2^63 computational cycles, So far nobody has
been able show a working collision for SHA-1.

&gt;<i> IMHO I am sure this will be exploited with a solid rationale in the near
</I>future.

Absolutely.. It's just a matter of biding time till someone figures out a
way, IMHO, PS3's (Cell Based Systems) &amp; GPUs are doing a remarkably
praiseworthy job of shrinking the computational time-line.

Having said that, the point I wanted to make regarding MD5 specifically
was that POCs and tools for attacking MD5 have been available for close to
3 years and these attacks have been a part of GHTQ curriculum. but nothing
was serious as this for MD5 uptil 'Now'... the metaphorical &quot;final nail in
the coffin&quot;.

The best bet as of now is to rely on multiple hashing algorithms for
critical systems; so even if one collision is generated other hashes would
fail to match.

NOTE: I can't recollect the names of those tools mentioned here but if
someone is interested in knowing them lemme know, I'd be glad to re-lookup
the same.

Warm Regards,

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for sharing the information. Just wanted to add some more to
</I>this.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you said:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Since, MD5 is also used in signing certificates the browsers will have
</I>no
&gt;<i> way of telling the difference between a genuine and a rogue website
</I>unless
&gt;<i> other hashing algorithms like SHA-1 are also used.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fyi, even SHA-1 is susceptible to collision attacks. Practically even if
</I>MD5
&gt;<i> or SHA-1 are broken, this vulnerability still can't be readily used to
</I>exploit the certificate genuinity uptil 'Now'. Having said that I did not
&gt;<i> mean that it can't be exploited at all thereby further exposing
</I>insecurity
&gt;<i> on the internet. What I am saying is until some more research is done on
</I>how
&gt;<i> to exploit this in relevance to the certificates, we can unwind and
</I>count
&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> atleast the certificates for now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some guys have come up with a PoC for the same, however not at a very
</I>reasonable level.
&gt;<i> May be you want to have a look at these:
