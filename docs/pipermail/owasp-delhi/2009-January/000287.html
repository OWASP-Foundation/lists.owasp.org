<PRE>Hello Abhishek,

 

It is indeed highly encouraging to see your interest in application security
right from your academics. 

 

Regarding your below query on SQL injection, it is always recommended to use
prepared statements to mitigate the risk. You may go through few interesting
and original write-ups as mentioned below. These uncovers addslashes(),
mysql_real_escape_string(), addcslashes() and nevertheless prepared
statements:

I hope this gives you plenty information on the subject in question.

 

OWASP meetings are free and open to everyone without any eligibility
criteria. Hope to meet you soon!

 

Many Thanks,

I am a first year student at Delhi College of Engineering and have recently
been learning PHP. I was wondering if there is any way to implement an SQL
Injection even when we have addslashes included in the code.
I also came across the concept of Rainbow tables. Does this make MD5 hashing
of small (in length) values irrelevant?

I also wanted to know if I am eligible to attend OWASP meetings.

Thank You

Hi Lava,

Nice to see your reply. Please see my thoughts on your comments.

&gt;<i>Now in the solution that you have suggested, the server has to fetch the
</I>user's password for each request which defeats the whole purpose of
maintaning session IDs.

Good point. My suggestion on this: Access the password only once and store
it in a temporary variable securely for further transactions and then delete
it as the session ends.

&gt;<i>Ironically you had already suggested a solution and then asked the
</I>question, wonder if you were just checking if everyone understood your talk
properly ;)

If you would have read this mailing thread from the very scratch, you would
have known that this question ain't related to salted MD5. I was not
checking if people understood my talks properly. I could have done that
there and then only.

&gt;<i>For your salted-hashning technique or the new techique there is to be a lot
</I>of client side JS code which has to create the salted hash and send it to
the server. The attacker would just intercept this message and replace your
JS with another JS which does every thing like the original JS but in
addition steals the user's clear text password and appends to the request
which the attacker can now get by viewing your request.

I would like to comment about the salted hashing part in a different e-mail
(if I get some time) as this topic is not what I am talking about here.
About the technique, in case if you can manipulate the generated hash
somehow by intercepting, and make up your own hash, can you still be a part
of the same session. I don't think so. Let me know if you can. Check out the
way I told about its workings.

Could you come up with some *PoC* to what you said? You said intercepting
and manipulating the traffic on the fly travelling from the server to the
client or the other way around? How would you do that sitting somewhere on
the network? I am curious to know.

I don't know why you guys keep involving SSL with this thing.

Thanks for your feedback.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for bringing up this topic, can see that it has tickled quite a few

</I>&gt;<i> I was on vacations and missed out on all the fun here, but its never too
</I>&gt;<i> late so here is my humble opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two very important factors that have to be considered here:

</I>&gt;<i> 1) Why is a session ID required.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) What is the possibilty of some one with sniffing capability to

&gt;<i> and manipulate the traffic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Why is a session ID required
</I>&gt;<i>  I believe sessiond IDs are used to avoid connecting to the DB each time
</I>&gt;<i> and validating the user's password, they are used to improve efficiency.
</I>&gt;<i> Now in the solution that you have suggested, the server has to fetch the
</I>&gt;<i> user's password for each request which defeats the whole purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> maintaning session IDs.
</I>&gt;<i> Since we are anyway reffering to the password for each request, I would
</I>&gt;<i> like to think that we can authenticate for each request with the
</I>salted-hash
&gt;<i> technique you suggested in your december OWASP talk, provided once a salt
</I>is
&gt;<i> used the server discards it and issues a new one.
</I>&gt;<i> Ironically you had already suggested a solution and then asked the

&gt;<i> properly ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) What is the possibilty of some one with sniffing capability to
</I>intercept
&gt;<i> and manipulate the traffic.
</I>&gt;<i> As someone who has done quite a bit of sniffing on customer networks
</I>during
&gt;<i> pentests, I think that someone who is capable of sniffing would in all
</I>&gt;<i> probability also be capable of intercepting and manipulating the traffic
</I>&gt;<i> between the client and server. There might be exceptions but they would be
</I>&gt;<i> uncommon.
</I>&gt;<i> Any techniquie which enforces some trust on the client-side logic now gets
</I>&gt;<i> defeated.
</I>&gt;<i> For your salted-hashning technique or the new techique there is to be a
</I>lot
&gt;<i> of client side JS code which has to create the salted hash and send it to
</I>&gt;<i> the server. The attacker would just intercept this message and replace

</I>&gt;<i> which the attacker can now get by viewing your request.
</I>&gt;<i> Once this happens the entitre security system is defeated as its so
</I>closely
&gt;<i> attached to the user's password.
</I>&gt;<i> So in my opinion once someone is able to intercept a clear-text traffic he
</I>&gt;<i> could directly or indirectly bypass most restictions enforced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The thing that differentiates SSL from the suggested approach is the use

&gt;<i> a way to do that our confidentiality and integrity solutions might fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dont cosider thick client approach like java applets as reverse
</I>engineering
&gt;<i> is a possibility.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, let me elucidate the workings of the technique I was talking about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But before that I just want to shed some light on a few things so no-one
</I>&gt;<i> comes again questioning to me about these and start some endless argument.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The e-commerce site I was talking about, I never said that they are only
</I>&gt;<i> using the technique I am going to discuss. They might be using other
</I>&gt;<i> techniques for their protection. What I meant was I've not seen/heard
</I>anyone
&gt;<i> else using this technique. That doesn't mean that they are only using this
</I>&gt;<i> technique for their protection. Every giant incorporates multi-tier
</I>security
&gt;<i> for their resources.  I am not sure what exactly they are using besides
</I>this
&gt;<i> technique as Nobody reveals that.  I questioned someone on a forum, he
</I>came
&gt;<i> up with this technique, I studied, checked this on their documentation
</I>page,
&gt;<i> discussed with some people, discussed with some more, argued with even
</I>more
&gt;<i> and now I am here. I am looking for some feedback from you all. Just let
</I>me
&gt;<i> know what ever you think is wrong with this. Anyhow the question is not
</I>that
&gt;<i> whether they are using it or not but the question is 'How good is the
</I>&gt;<i> technique?'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Please don't misinterpret my statement. I am not saying 'Don't use SSL'.
</I>&gt;<i> SSL is definitely a protection mechanism for &quot;Now&quot; if we use it
</I>&gt;<i> appropriately (CA signed certificate with a well-tested, well-reviewed
</I>&gt;<i> implementation). Use SSL till someone finds some exploit *practically* not
</I>&gt;<i> theoretically. This whole discussion is based on a research question so
</I>I/we
&gt;<i> can get a *feasible* working solution for this (may-be-a-future) problem.
</I>If
&gt;<i> you are not interested in discussing please do not comment. And please do
</I>&gt;<i> not envisage what I am not saying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So here is how it works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No SSL. All traffic in clear text.
</I>&gt;<i> Initially we need to communicate an OOB password/code/nonce (whatever you
</I>&gt;<i> call it) to the client - only *once* not each time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The client initiates a connection request to the server. As a result,
</I>&gt;<i> server will initiate a handshake process to synchronize the time-stamps
</I>&gt;<i> between the client and itself. Then the server will analyze tolerance time
</I>&gt;<i> of packets leaving the client workstation till it reaches the server. The
</I>&gt;<i> tolerance time is configured so to manage slow hosts or slow traffic. In
</I>&gt;<i> plain words, server synchronizes date and time (in seconds, milliseconds
</I>or
&gt;<i> even nanoseconds based on the criticality of the application) with the
</I>&gt;<i> client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. At the client side: the message, instantaneous time-stamp and the
</I>&gt;<i> password are concatenated and hashed via SHA-1/SHA-256, whatever one
</I>wishes.
&gt;<i> This ensuing hash is combined with the username to form an authentication
</I>&gt;<i> header and sent to the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. At the server side, the server sees the username and perceives which
</I>&gt;<i> user is trying to authenticate. Based on the tolerance configured
</I>initially
&gt;<i> at the handshake time, it picks the time-stamp from its own clock and
</I>using
&gt;<i> the password and the message it generates the hash in the same way as it
</I>was
&gt;<i> done at the client side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. If the hash matches it generates a Session ID and maps it to the
</I>&gt;<i> username of the user. This Session ID will be sent from the client to the
</I>&gt;<i> server along with the computed hash (which is different for each request -
</I>&gt;<i> see next Step)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Now if the client sends another request, it appends and then hashes the
</I>&gt;<i> message, password and the time-stamp (which will be apparently because of
</I>&gt;<i> the different instantaneous time-stamp i.e. date and time). This resulting
</I>&gt;<i> string is sent to the server along with the Session ID assigned to the
</I>user
&gt;<i> earlier. The resulting string contains a different hash as the time has
</I>&gt;<i> changed. This will be validated at the server the same way as in Step 3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now how can an adversary exploit this scenario? What I think of are two
</I>&gt;<i> ways:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Either he will capture one of the hashes and try to predict the next
</I>&gt;<i> hash by brute forcing different time-stamps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - But this can not be possible. He doesn't have the password to generate
</I>&gt;<i> the hash.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What if he captures a series of requests and responses and replays them
</I>&gt;<i> back to the server at a later stage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - This can't be possible either. In order to interact with the server, one
</I>&gt;<i> needs to handshake so to synchronize itself with the server's clock. The
</I>&gt;<i> attacker would not be able to synchronize because he would not be able to
</I>&gt;<i> synchronize the *past-timestamp* (in the captured traffic) with the
</I>server's
&gt;<i> current time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Lastly for the newbies, what if he captures the Session ID.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - But he would not be able to produce the matching Hash for the request,
</I>so
&gt;<i> no luck.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few things to contemplate:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. This will be considerably be CPU intensive but can be acknowledged if
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the processing cycles SSL takes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Time synchronization can be complex. I have no idea how to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Please provide your
</I>&gt;<i> feedback/fury/antagonism/annoyance/appreciation/whatever. Hope I explained
</I>&gt;<i> this in a very straightforward way.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the idea. Please don't take my talks as overstatements, I just

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many organizations implement session mechanisms without using SSL. As a

</I>&gt;<i> For sessions on non-SSL, there are many undocumented solutions which can

</I>&gt;<i> Tell me **how** would a sniffer miss your validation code on an

&gt;<i> just out of curiousity I want to know if I don't use SSL/VPN or any other

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; salted MD5 hashing protects the authentication credentials rightly from

</I>&gt;<i> Salting is used to protect MD5 hashes from rainbow table attacks.
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently Yes, although ultimately it protects authentication credentials

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SSL does the same thing.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, SSL is used to ensure confidentiality and trust in the network
</I>&gt;<i> communiation. Confidentiality (or prevention of network eavesdropping) is
</I>&gt;<i> ensured by encryption. Trust is accomplished by Server and/or client
</I>&gt;<i> certificates.
</I>&gt;<i> I know what SSL does, but my question is something else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, in some scenarios SSL might not be feasible. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> causing heavy load on the server or may be some applications don't support
</I>&gt;<i> it, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> In such cases SSL Accelerators are used. They are devices which can be fit
</I>&gt;<i> into the architecture without changing the application or affecting the
</I>load
&gt;<i> on the application server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again my question is something else. I know if SSL doesn't work,
</I>&gt;<i> accelerators help expedite the processing. What I want to know is, if I
</I>&quot;Do
&gt;<i> Not&quot; want to use SSL what measures can be taken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can protect the authentication credentials using salted MD5 hashing
</I>&gt;<i> or by using SSL.
</I>&gt;<i> To protect authentication credentials in HTTP, we have to rely on SSL.
</I>&gt;<i> Hashes are a secure (aka not in clear text) way to store authentication
</I>&gt;<i> credentials.
</I>&gt;<i> So you are proclaiming that we *have to* rely  on SSL- no other
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.
</I>&gt;<i> Hashes are also used in many applications for many different purposes
</I>&gt;<i> besides authenticity and integrity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order to protect the Session credentials (Session ID, tokens,
</I>&gt;<i> cookies, etc) on a non-SSL channel what measures can be taken?
</I>&gt;<i> To protect either auth or session credentials we have to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> confidentiality of the communication channel. If we dont use HTTPS, then
</I>VPN
&gt;<i> might be another option. While authentication credentials can be protected
</I>&gt;<i> by some challenge handshake mechanism (similar to CHAP), we would need to
</I>&gt;<i> protect session creds by encrypting the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> I was asking that if we can provide some protection on the application
</I>&gt;<i> level rather than on the network level. Besides SSL/VPN there are many
</I>&gt;<i> options available for protecting the authentication credentials. I want to
</I>&gt;<i> know (just out of curiousity) that how can we secure the session
</I>credentials
&gt;<i> on an unencrypted/non-SSL channel. I know this will take too much
</I>processing
&gt;<i> cycles, time synchronization, quantization in milliseconds even
</I>nanoseconds,
&gt;<i> affirmation of the key exchange, dynamic hashing key generation to
</I>mitigate
&gt;<i> replay attacks, and even more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just want to know  if anyone has an idea on how it can be done if h/she
</I>&gt;<i> is willing to share that would be really appreciative. Please make sure
</I>&gt;<i> you understand what I am looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> No offence :)
