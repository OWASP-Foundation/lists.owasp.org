<PRE>Hi,

Ok, let me elucidate the workings of the technique I was talking about.

But before that I just want to shed some light on a few things so no-one
comes again questioning to me about these and start some endless argument.

- The e-commerce site I was talking about, I never said that they are only
using the technique I am going to discuss. They might be using other
techniques for their protection. What I meant was I've not seen/heard anyone
else using this technique. That doesn't mean that they are only using this
technique for their protection. Every giant incorporates multi-tier security
for their resources.  I am not sure what exactly they are using besides this
technique as Nobody reveals that.  I questioned someone on a forum, he came
up with this technique, I studied, checked this on their documentation page,
discussed with some people, discussed with some more, argued with even more
and now I am here. I am looking for some feedback from you all. Just let me
know what ever you think is wrong with this. Anyhow the question is not that
whether they are using it or not but the question is 'How good is the
technique?'

- Please don't misinterpret my statement. I am not saying 'Don't use SSL'.
SSL is definitely a protection mechanism for &quot;Now&quot; if we use it
appropriately (CA signed certificate with a well-tested, well-reviewed
implementation). Use SSL till someone finds some exploit *practically* not
theoretically. This whole discussion is based on a research question so I/we
can get a *feasible* working solution for this (may-be-a-future) problem. If
you are not interested in discussing please do not comment. And please do
not envisage what I am not saying.

So here is how it works.

No SSL. All traffic in clear text.
Initially we need to communicate an OOB password/code/nonce (whatever you
call it) to the client - only *once* not each time.


1. The client initiates a connection request to the server. As a result,
server will initiate a handshake process to synchronize the time-stamps
between the client and itself. Then the server will analyze tolerance time
of packets leaving the client workstation till it reaches the server. The
tolerance time is configured so to manage slow hosts or slow traffic. In
plain words, server synchronizes date and time (in seconds, milliseconds or
even nanoseconds based on the criticality of the application) with the
client.

2. At the client side: the message, instantaneous time-stamp and the
password are concatenated and hashed via SHA-1/SHA-256, whatever one wishes.
This ensuing hash is combined with the username to form an authentication
header and sent to the server.

3. At the server side, the server sees the username and perceives which user
is trying to authenticate. Based on the tolerance configured initially at
the handshake time, it picks the time-stamp from its own clock and using the
password and the message it generates the hash in the same way as it was
done at the client side.

4. If the hash matches it generates a Session ID and maps it to the username
of the user. This Session ID will be sent from the client to the server
along with the computed hash (which is different for each request - see next
Step)

5. Now if the client sends another request, it appends and then hashes the
message, password and the time-stamp (which will be apparently because of
the different instantaneous time-stamp i.e. date and time). This resulting
string is sent to the server along with the Session ID assigned to the user
earlier. The resulting string contains a different hash as the time has
changed. This will be validated at the server the same way as in Step 3.

Now how can an adversary exploit this scenario? What I think of are two
ways:

1. Either he will capture one of the hashes and try to predict the next hash
by brute forcing different time-stamps.

- But this can not be possible. He doesn't have the password to generate the
hash.
2. What if he captures a series of requests and responses and replays them
back to the server at a later stage.

- This can't be possible either. In order to interact with the server, one
needs to handshake so to synchronize itself with the server's clock. The
attacker would not be able to synchronize because he would not be able to
synchronize the *past-timestamp* (in the captured traffic) with the server's
current time.

3. Lastly for the newbies, what if he captures the Session ID.
- But he would not be able to produce the matching Hash for the request, so
no luck.

A few things to contemplate:

1. This will be considerably be CPU intensive but can be acknowledged if
compared to the processing cycles SSL takes.

2. Time synchronization can be complex. I have no idea how to do that.
3. Please provide your
feedback/fury/antagonism/annoyance/appreciation/whatever. Hope I explained
this in a very straightforward way.

Thanks.

Gunwant

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plash,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the idea. Please don't take my talks as overstatements, I just
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to have some innovative ideas from you guys.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many organizations implement session mechanisms without using SSL. As a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of fact these are not the conditions that I have set. There are many
</I>&gt;<i> scenarios where using SSL is unworkable and in order to provide protection,
</I>&gt;<i> there are solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it becomes more relevant when people are trying to prove the
</I>&gt;<i> weaknesses of SSL. Not to forget, facts say that most organizations who use
</I>&gt;<i> SSL, use self signed certificates rather than a CA sign it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For sessions on non-SSL, there are many undocumented solutions which can be
</I>&gt;<i> put into practice but such solutions needs to be well-reviewed and
</I>&gt;<i> well-tested before they are implemented. I have come to know about one of
</I>&gt;<i> the methods implemented by one of the top e-commerce portal giants. This
</I>&gt;<i> solution is a bit tough to understand and subsequently implement it. Before
</I>&gt;<i> I discuss it on the mailing list, I need to make sure that I understand it
</I>&gt;<i> well. The only thing I can share at the moment is, it uses time-stamps.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, I would be discussing this proposition in detail in the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> Delhi Chapter meeting this month.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry if my talks were exaggerated. I still seek more ideas on the same
</I>&gt;<i> question if someone is willing to share.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can protect the authentication credentials using salted MD5 hashing

</I>&gt;<i> To protect authentication credentials in HTTP, we have to rely on SSL.

</I>&gt;<i> So you are proclaiming that we *have to* rely  on SSL- no other
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.
</I>&gt;<i> Hashes are also used in many applications for many different purposes
</I>&gt;<i> besides authenticity and integrity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order to protect the Session credentials (Session ID, tokens,
</I>&gt;<i> cookies, etc) on a non-SSL channel what measures can be taken?
</I>&gt;<i> To protect either auth or session credentials we have to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> confidentiality of the communication channel. If we dont use HTTPS, then VPN
</I>&gt;<i> might be another option. While authentication credentials can be protected
</I>&gt;<i> by some challenge handshake mechanism (similar to CHAP), we would need to
</I>&gt;<i> protect session creds by encrypting the channel.
</I>&gt;<i> I was asking that if we can provide some protection on the application
</I>&gt;<i> level rather than on the network level. Besides SSL/VPN there are many
</I>&gt;<i> options available for protecting the authentication credentials. I want to
</I>&gt;<i> know (just out of curiousity) that how can we secure the session credentials
