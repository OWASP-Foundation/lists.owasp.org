<PRE>Great Idea, I think we can approach different WAF companies to provide us
with this opportunity of testing their product and then releasing a detailed
comparison chart for the industry. We may call it some OWASP project for
which we can take approval from the global board. But it is again a theory
to support yours ;-) I know a couple of WAF companies who I think would be
interested to participate. But it would break your 0-day mission :-)

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Hi Everyone, 

There is a possible 0-day that I would like to test on Web Application
Firewalls. 

I currently dont have access to one so its still a theory. 

If someone has an ASP.NET application running behind any Web Application
Firewall in your environment or else where then kindly let me know. 

I can promise you it would be really intresting and completely safe ;) 

Send me a private message if you would like to keep it under wraps. 


Thanks and Regards,
Lavakumar K
