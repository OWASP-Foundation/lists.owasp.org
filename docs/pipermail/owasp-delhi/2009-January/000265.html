Re: [Owasp-delhi] SSL Broken..





verify user offline.. send an sms(or similar) with a validation code(long 
randomly genrated  string) to the user everytime he logs in to validate 
and use it everytime a transaction (high risk) is done or role is 
changed.. best way still will be to use it over SSL and use digital 
signatures

Regards
Plash

Re: [Owasp-delhi] SSL Broken..






Hi,

Thanks for your reply but that did not answer my question. You are telling 
me what I can use for protecting the credentials. I know what I can use, 
but just out of curiousity I want to know if I don't use SSL/VPN or any 
other network based protection, what else can be done on the application 
layer in order to protect the credentials. Please see the answers below.

&gt;<i> salted MD5 hashing protects the authentication credentials rightly from 
</I>eavesdropping on the network. 
Salting is used to protect MD5 hashes from rainbow table attacks. 
Apparently Yes, although ultimately it protects authentication credentials 
only. Facts say the highest risk is eavesdropping if the session is 
unencrypted. 

&gt;<i> SSL does the same thing. 
</I>Yes, SSL is used to ensure confidentiality and trust in the network 
communiation. Confidentiality (or prevention of network eavesdropping) is 
ensured by encryption. Trust is accomplished by Server and/or client 
certificates.
I know what SSL does, but my question is something else. 

&gt;<i> However, in some scenarios SSL might not be feasible. For example, 
</I>causing heavy load on the server or may be some applications don't support 
it, etc. 
In such cases SSL Accelerators are used. They are devices which can be fit 
into the architecture without changing the application or affecting the 
load on the application server. 

Again my question is something else. I know if SSL doesn't work, 
accelerators help expedite the processing. What I want to know is, if I 
&quot;Do Not&quot; want to use SSL what measures can be taken.


&gt;<i> We can protect the authentication credentials using salted MD5 hashing 
</I>or by using SSL. 
To protect authentication credentials in HTTP, we have to rely on SSL. 
Hashes are a secure (aka not in clear text) way to store authentication 
credentials. 
So you are proclaiming that we *have to* rely  on SSL- no other 
alternative. 
Hashes are also used in many applications for many different purposes 
besides authenticity and integrity.


&gt;<i> In order to protect the Session credentials (Session ID, tokens, 
</I>cookies, etc) on a non-SSL channel what measures can be taken? 
To protect either auth or session credentials we have to ensure 
confidentiality of the communication channel. If we dont use HTTPS, then 
VPN might be another option. While authentication credentials can be 
protected by some challenge handshake mechanism (similar to CHAP), we 
would need to protect session creds by encrypting the channel. 
I was asking that if we can provide some protection on the application 
level rather than on the network level. Besides SSL/VPN there are many 
options available for protecting the authentication credentials. I want to 
know (just out of curiousity) that how can we secure the session 
credentials on an unencrypted/non-SSL channel. I know this will take too 
much processing cycles, time synchronization, quantization in milliseconds 
even nanoseconds, affirmation of the key exchange, dynamic hashing key 
generation to mitigate replay attacks, and even more. 

I just want to know  if anyone has an idea on how it can be done if h/she 
is willing to share that would be really appreciative. Please make sure 
you understand what I am looking for.
No offence :)
