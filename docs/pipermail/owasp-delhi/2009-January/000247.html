Dear Patron,
 
Trust that you are doing well!As an esteemed member of OWASP Delhi Chapter we wanted to wish you a Very Happy and Prosperous New Year 2009. 
 
Our strength has been growing on daily basis and as of date we have patronization of over 326 members who share there research, experiences and guidelines with there continuous regular postings on message boards. On the Last day of the year 2008 we would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members for the support that they have extended in making this year successful once again
 
Further more just to recap the activities and the new ventures which Delhi Chapter had entered into are shared for everyone's notice :
 
q       The year started with the launch of the First Application Security Conference in India by OWASP Delhi Chapter and was customized for the benefit of the Indian geography addressing critical pain points and issues which we deal with on day to day basis. The conference &quot;OWASP AppSec India Conference 2008&quot; was held in New Delhi on 19th and 20th August, 2008 at India Habitat Centre, and received an overwhelming response from all corners of India with attendance of almost 350 delegates and well over 150 companies involved in the business. The Star Speakers at the conference included even Dr. Kamlesh Bajaj who Heads DSCI which is a NASSCOM initiative, and the hands-on workshops included world acclaimed speakers and instructors Like Jason Li (OWASP Foundation), Shreeraj Shah (Blue Infy), Mano Paul (SecuRisk Solutions), Nishchal Bhalla (Security Compass), Gaurav Kumar (Microsoft) and others..The conference was also well sponsored and supported by HP Software, Paladion, SDGC Software, Armorise Technologies, Torrid Networks, Ostfold Software, ISC2, Biztech, Event Avenue.The photographs and details are available at <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_India_Conference_2008#Official_Event_Supporters.2FPartners">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_India_Conference_2008#Official_Event_Supporters.2FPartners</A> With this overwhelming success the Second Edition is being planned to be hosted in September, 2009 and the dates would be notified shortly to enable members in blocking there calendars. This time it will be even bigger conference with International Participation growing as OWASP Delhi Chapter will be bringing the OWASP Application Security Asia Conference 2009 which will be held in India. 
q       Delhi Chapter made its presence felt by the participation of our Director Dhruv Soi being invited to share his knowledge at the recently held Application Security Asia Conference 2008 held in Taiwan. All appreciated the efforts and with contributions coming in from all other Chapter Leaders based out in different countries. 
q       Continuing on the effort regular chapter meetings became a knowledge sharing point for all the members and 
&#216;        The first chapter meeting was held on October 18th, 2008 at Noida and was hosted by Sopra Group under the Aegis of OWASP Delhi Chapter, the meeting was attended by well over 80 members and key topics discussed included Web Services Security, Browser Based Attacks, XSS &amp; CSRF, etc.Click here to access the presentations and photographs from the meeting : <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Delhi_Meeting_October_18th_2008">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Delhi_Meeting_October_18th_2008</A>  
&#216;        The second Chapter Meeting was held on November 29th, 2008 at Noida and was hosted by Tata Consultancy Services under the Aegis of OWASP Delhi Chapter, the meeting again was attended by well over 70members and key topics in the discussion forum included ESAPI, Flash Vulnerabilities and Exploits, Authentication Attacks, etc.The Presentations and Photographs are available at : <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Delhi_Meeting_November_29th_2008">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Delhi_Meeting_November_29th_2008</A>
q       Highlights of the year came when our Directors Puneet Mehta and Dhruv Soi were nominated in the OWASP Global Committees in October 2008, to share there knowledge and inputs in the various projects being undertaken. 
q       Delhi Chapter to further the initiatives in the coming New Year has formed its committees for Communications and Events and awaits to have responses from members who would like to take voluntary part in new committees which can be formed. 
 
It has indeed been an eventful year for OWASP Delhi Chapter with all the help from its members. We would like to have more and more meaningful interaction and take suggestions from your side to make the coming New Year 2009 even bigger. We would request you to revert to us on the various activities which we can together perform for the knowledge gain and benefit of all the members associated with the chapter by way of:
