Hi Dhruv,

 

Let me thank you all for such a considerable support and help against my
queries.

Coming back to my point as you asked in your last e-mail that how did I
come to know that I am running out of the exploits, I am to say that I
run penetration tests mostly against web applications and servers and I
do have a massive collection of exploits/links since long time so to run
them against those poor company resources. I audit for a US based
company and it is a fact observed by me that in some companies, you will
find many basic vulnerabilities that even you can't expect. For example,
there was a server I did audit a long time back and it was like  you
imagine an attack and that can be possible in that server application -
No restrictions :-) . A few companies have applications/networks that
have all those basic risks already removed before testing on the Level
1. I agree that it can be because of the critical CIA rating. Even for
such companies if I do tests for their network(s) I find some of my
exploits are obsolete. They will work but with legacy networks. These
exploits were perfect at some time but now it seems they may or may not
work.

 

Also, I agree to the fact that only usage of exploits can't guarantee
you that you have tested all the bits and pieces of a network and
against all the underlying vulnerabilities. One must know the underlying
technology and how it is implemented with the other technologies. One
can break in at any time if he effectively collects information about
the network and use correct things at right time - right?. "Still" I am
sure that exploits are very much indispensable to use against a network
to prepare a PoC. I disagree with your point that utilities like
Metasploit provide you with all major exploitations (I am not sure about
Core Impact). They do have some but not majority of them but whatever
this tool has, is appreciable. You see exploits are the most valuable
piece of code for a security researcher, so not readily available for
the script kiddies out there in the wild - so I don't think zero days
are available even if you pay. 

 

I will check the links sent by you, thanks a lot for those links.

 

Thank you all!

 

Cheers.

Greetings Gunwant,

 

Good to see you back in action!! As you have already got few good
responses against your query, so I won't reiterate the known theory
here. But I would certainly like to participate in this thread. 

 

How would you know that you are running out of exploits? Do you see,
there have been numerous vulnerabilities published on the
internet/non-disclosure channels or transferred via
IRC/contacts/pre-published advisories to your knowledge these days, at
fast pace than expected? If you rely on published vulnerabilities, and
if administrators have fixed those vulnerabilities by applying the
patches then you have no option but to wait for administrators to commit
yet another mistake (I am sure, they do care for security
auditors/attackers to have some fun with the company resources :-) ).
Even if not, you would still find numbers of servers on the wild
available, un-patched for MS03/04/05-00X vulnerability and tons of
IIS/Apache servers those are vulnerable to old time attacks. Don't be
surprised if I say that during a recent pen-test assignment, we found
MS02-018 vulnerability in a live web server for some reputed and well
known company (obviously, can't disclose the name of client to avoid
making you jump out of your chair). Seems to be funny, ain't it? But,
welcome to India!!! Lot of effort is still required to make the
community know the risk of hosting vulnerable resources to wild wild web
(www). There are still lots of reputed websites those are running with
information disclosure vulnerability (no exploit needed, hah!), where
the available information is worth few bucks, if not million dollars!!!
I don't run/promote any shop in a Nehru Place though :-)

 

Network based attacks could vary due to variety of architectures
available today, so gathering good amount of standalone exploits for
every architecture would be a tough job and hence, we can rely on known
tools like metasploit/coreimpact those have almost all (If not all, then
many) variants of known exploit codes with options to inject shell codes
of your choice. Along with this, there are others web resources to
standalone exploits and those have already been mentioned in earlier
replies to your query, there could ofcourse be lot more those you could

be from past 4yrs) so am not sure how many of those links still work, so
excuse me if none of those work for you. But anyhow, I have pasted those

For application based exploits, it is already been said that cheat

Hi all,

 

I am back again with a question. Thank you for your support so far.

While testing, I have come to know that I am running out of exploits.
Since administrators are coming up with latest patches to cover up the
existing vulnerabilities, one must also update his/her exploit
collection w.r.t the vulnerabilities found. I have a collection of some
exploits which are mostly for web servers (IIS, Apache, etc.). Just
wanted to know, what resources you guys use to get the exploits, or you
build your own. I m looking for both network based and application based
exploits. May be if someone wants to share some exploits or links for
any resources. Any feedback will be highly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Gunwant Singh

: -) Jitesh Kamat

... An interesting article discussing the economics of 0-day exploit
research.

http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/470

The main finding of the article. One or more of the following conditions
exist:

- According to the market prices for 0-day exploits, the security risk
from 0-day vulnerabilities is vastly overestimated, 

- According to IT risk models, vulnerabilities are completely
underpriced, or 

- Most 0-day developers lack basic negotiation skills. 

Recent public transactions for exploits (from
http://weis07.infosecon.net/papers/29.pdf)


Some exploits, $200,000 - $250,000

Significant, reliable exploit, $125,000

Internet Explorer, $60,000 - $120,000

Vista exploit, $50,000

Weaponized exploit, $20,000-$30,000 

ZDI, iDefense purchases, $2,000-$10,000

WMF exploit $4000

Microsoft Excel, $1200

Mozilla, $500

Hi all,

 

I am back again with a question. Thank you for your support so far.

While testing, I have come to know that I am running out of exploits.
Since administrators are coming up with latest patches to cover up the
existing vulnerabilities, one must also update his/her exploit
collection w.r.t the vulnerabilities found. I have a collection of some
exploits which are mostly for web servers (IIS, Apache, etc.). Just
wanted to know, what resources you guys use to get the exploits, or you
build your own. I m looking for both network based and application based
exploits. May be if someone wants to share some exploits or links for
any resources. Any feedback will be highly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Gunwant Singh

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Google opens up RatProxy
Message-ID: <48743d33.1cbd720a.64ed.ffffbc58@mx.google.com>

Google developed a Web page vulnerability sniffer application for its own
internal use, and called it RatProxy <http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/> .
It is described as:

A semi-automated, largely passive web application security audit tool,
optimized for an accurate and sensitive detection, and automatic annotation,
of potential problems and security-relevant design patterns based on the
observation of existing, user-initiated traffic in complex web 2.0
environments.

It is capable of detecting unsecured data channels, cross-site scripting
flaws, and high-risk code that references data from outside domains. It even
prioritizes detected issues for you. It supports FreeBSD, Linux-based, and
MacOS X environments, and even the MS Windows Unix-emulation environment,
Cygwin, according to the information on the RatProxy homepage at Google
Code.

As of this month, RatProxy is publicly available under the terms of the
Apache License 2.0 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0> , a Copyfree
<http://copyfree.org/> , Free Software
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html> , and Open Source
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category>  license. Yes, RatProxy is now
open source software, by every major definition.

Google's hope seems to be that Web developers will use the tool to help
secure their sites, in particular when using increasingly popular cross-site
content aggregation Website design techniques. As a sample test results
screenshot <http://ratproxy.googlecode.com/files/ratproxy-screen.png>
demonstrates, RatProxy output is well-organized and full of helpful
information. It's a tool I will personally use in the future.

You can download it directly from the RatProxy project homepage as a source
tarball, and as a Google Code project you can even get an svn checkout
<http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/source/checkout>  if you like.

RatProxy is far from the only such tool in existence - it is not a new idea.
In fact, the fairly comprehensive wiki documentation
<http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/wiki/RatproxyDoc>  for RatProxy lists a
few alternative tools, in case you're interested in trying out the
"competition". The documentation also makes a good case for why RatProxy
isn't just redundant and ignorable, however. Being an open source tool, and
one developed for in-house use by a very high profile Web application
service provider with an excellent security reputation, RatProxy is sure to
remain quite relevant and useful for some time to come.

Of course, such tools are just a way to make things a little easier. They
tend to be useful only for identifying very limited selections of
vulnerabilities, and should not be considered a magic wand for discovering
and fixing software vulnerabilities. Use a tool like RatProxy, by all means,
but when you're done with it and have fixed all the identified
vulnerabilities, you should still go over the Website source with a
fine-toothed comb.

There is no substitute for diligence and intelligent analysis.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Are you a user of HackerSafe (re-branded to McAfee
	Secure)?
Message-ID: <487aff19.09f8720a.1244.49ee@mx.google.com>

During one of my recent meetings with a prospective customer who is into
online business, I tried convincing him to get his web infrastructure
assessed. But company was satisfied and highly confident for being secured
by using HackerSafe. HackerSafe or any other automated assessment framework
can't be as effective as a manual assessment, where few human minds are at
work. But unfortunately, when it comes to information security, cost towards
convincing a customer and making him/her understand the worth of security
assessment is much higher than actually executing the assessment exercise. 

 

I just found few online articles and a video on HackerSafe and thought to
share with you (will surely, share these with that prospect as well :-))

Not PCI Compliant.

I am not sure whether to take 'HackerSafe' in a literal way. In one of my
previous assignments, a site with that logo was found to have a serious SQL
injection vulnerability which allowed us to gain access to the web host (it
was a pen test). From that day on, my trust for this logo lessened.
