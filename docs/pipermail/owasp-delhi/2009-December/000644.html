<PRE>thats right vaibhav..
 
I was meant to place authentication control in between.. if we block
relay there is no use to have SMTP.
 
since it was mentioned below: test like open relay, mail spoofing, both
are interconnected.  We test open relay to prevent mail spoofing.

Hello Raj.
 
If you block there Relay you will not able to send the mails. Then there
will be no use of SMTP.
Kindly refer to SMTP AUTH, to stop Open Mail Relay.

	 Hi All,
	 
	I need to have one clarification here regarding open relay, mail
spoofing;  Is it possible to perform mail spoofing if open relay is
blocked on a mail server.

		Apart from standard assessment of mail server to check
for vulnerabilities in the SMTP/POP3/IMAP/OS software there are few mail
server specific test like open relay, mail spoofing, usage of plain text
protocols, user harvesting VRFY (SMTP command), Brute Force Prevention
to POP3/SMTP/webmail, Malware Evasion, SPAM Tests, Information Leakage
in bounced messages, webmail security, password policies etc.

		 

		Hope Helpful.
