It great to see the comparison. We are using AppScan for more than 5 years now and I somehow feel that it does not give me full control to do everything.

Its of course a good tool for novice starting AppSec. We also use Cenzic and it give me some extra features and maybe also a way to compare every time I get into a engagement.

FYI, AppScan has a Enterprise version and its a cool tool for a enterprise wise deployment and getting AppSec testing into SDLC.

Abir,

Thanks for this report. It gives me a good reason to try WebInspect :-)

thanks,
Gautam

Hello Manik,

Webinspect is much better than Appscan since appscan shows up a lot of false positives and the best web vulnerablity canner would be Acunetix WVS + Acusensor. Please the comparision file attached.

Interesting, as per report none of the test bed was on  Java.

My two cents.

Tests can improve a lot If

1) Scans are configured properly ( how to scan and parse links, specific
fields to complete a workflow )
2) type of Policy used ( one can even customize to get the best result )
3) In general most of the known  commercial web application scanners are
more or less good ( I dont consider Qualys as a pureplay web App scanner,
it lags a lot of features in a typical web app scanner )

Plash

"Accuracy", IMHO, matters a lot more than the "number of features". You don't want a tool to give you nicely formatted info with a bunch of false positives. These scanners are anyways fairly costly.

Talking about commercial tools, I am told Armorize a smart set of tools. On the open source front, w3af is definitely worth a look.

If I am not wrong, Larry Suto was part of NTO Spider Team.

The following link is also interesting, although it doesn't refer to current
paper, but helps in identifying author :P

Armorize has a Static Code Security Vulnerability Scanner (SCSVS) which checks vulnerabilities at the source code level.  AppScan, Webinspect and Acunetix are Web Application Security Vulnerability Scanners (WASVS) which check for runtime vulnerabilities of web applications.

"Accuracy", IMHO, matters a lot more than the "number of features". You don't want a tool to give you nicely formatted info with a bunch of false positives. These scanners are anyways fairly costly.

Talking about commercial tools, I am told Armorize a smart set of tools. On the open source front, w3af is definitely worth a look.

	Automated Vs Manual tools
Message-ID: <8d02c1c31003020420l603136dfu929f093071d24dea@mail.gmail.com>

whilst we are discussing a clear winner.. how about throwing something in to
the mix..

Perhaps extending the conversation to include manual tools.

Do you reckon, Automated tools produce value for money. Is it good enough to
discover every bug, mite, under the wraps?

Or using manual tools still provides an upper hand?

Or a good review of an application should require a mix of both manual tool
and automated tool?

What are your thoughts?

    Dear OWASP Delhi,

    Can anyone provide complete and comprehensive information, sites of web server vulnerability assessment by manual method and by automated tools.

    1. What are the free tools / open source tools actually and 
    practically used for web serv V A ?

    2. What are the commercial tools used for automated web server V A ?

    3. How a manual web server v a is conducted ? Any checklist and the

    4. People can share their web server v a experience.

    Thanks & regards,

I think, it would be more relevant a question for the following mailing
list.

http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/monit-general

>From my past experience I have learned that most irrelevant questions or
questions that are too vague generally go unanswered on any mailing list.
Best approach is to be precise & to the point and hit the right mailing
list.

All it takes to identify relevant mailing list is a little bit of Googling
:)
