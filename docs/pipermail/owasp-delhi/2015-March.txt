Message-ID: <2BFAB8A31E9BD54A8B7CC07BCD01970645D7492B@chnshlmbx14>

Hi Folks,



Has anyone worked on Microsoft Threat Modeling tool 2014 version? We couldn't find any documentation on tool features . For e.g. what each type of Stencil is all about, etc. We are trying to build an application threat model . However, the tool gives out a lot of generic errors and warnings and we couldn't find any supporting documentation to help resolve those.



Sample Errors and Warnings:-



The connector is not attached to stencils in a close proximity. Error   Diagram 1       True

External interactor should communicate over trust boundary.     Warning Diagram 1       True



Attached TMTGettingStartedGuide.docx doesn't explain tool features in detail.  Any suggestions would be of great help. Thanks in advance.



Kind Regards,

Archana

Suman:?
For each block there is a limited connecting points? which u can see as dot points.. so when u r connecting one block to other..both should be connected on their dot points.?

External interactor should communicate over trust boundary. Warning Diagram 1 True

Suman:?

In this case you have not created a trust boundary..so lets say if u have webserver hosted behind firewall then u have to create a trust boundary between external user block diagram and webserver.. and webserver should be inside the trust boundaries. ?

Attached TMTGettingStartedGuide.docx doesn't explain tool features in detail. Any suggestions would be of great help. Thanks in advance.

1) Connector is just lying there and not attached to one of the little
squares on the entity. Do that and your error will go away.

2) You need to understand the trust boundaries first. You might be using
some external connector such as browser which might be communicating with a
server and you're putting them in one trust boundary. Separate them with a
boundary, this warning will go away.

Regarding references, refer Threat Modelling book by Snyder or another book
by Adam Shostock.
