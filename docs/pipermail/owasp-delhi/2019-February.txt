Reminder ? this is the last week to submit to the first round of our CFP
(Call for Presentations).



This is going to be a truly fabulous event, I highly recommend
participating! Most of our talks will be selected from the first round, so
do your best to get your submission in now. And please share with your
chapter / project list / anyone else that has something interesting to
share! J



Submit here: https://telaviv.appsecglobal.org/program/call-for-papers



And if you are concerned about submitting, or this would be your first time
speaking at a conference ? don?t worry! We will support you the whole way
and provide any mentoring you need. (You can even reach out to me
personally for support, as I am not on the content review committee J )

One more note: we are working on dedicating a budget to assist a few
speakers that would not otherwise be able to join us, due to lack of funds
or employer ? so do not let this hold you back.



Chapter Leaders: if you will be having a chapter meeting any time soon,
we?d really appreciate if you could share this at your meeting! If you
would like a slide to display the details, there is one here (
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EFi9Ke6eYBQ0nCC24ZhxFW5MozCj46rnhUpi0WoOHEU/edit?usp=sharing)
