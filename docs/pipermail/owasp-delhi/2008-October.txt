Message-ID: <ab4f83420809302240i6147b7c2y209a775685b7c91f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have recently started a Research project on State Based IPS which
requires
IDS/IPS signatures. We have downloaded the SNORT signature set and
currently working with that. But we came to know that some of the
signatures by commercial vendors are not released in open source domain
and we need to go for paid subscription for that.

In view of this, Can anyone help me with providing references to such
commercial vendors who provide paid subscription to IDS/IPS signatures.
Our management is ready to invest in that.

Best regards

Hello All,
Government has come up with a plan to use active hands on hackers for
purposes relating to national security.
It has been planned to invite all such hackers from various parts of the
country who could be helpful in ensuring security and integrity of the
nation.
I have been assigned the responsibility to provide a platform where such
interactions among law enforcement agencies, national security agencies and
the professioanl hackers could take a shape.

I invite personal mails to me from individual hackers who wish to
participate in a one to one interaction with the agencies.

The meet would be scheduled some time in the end of october or beginning of
November.

Please feel free to contact me -

Mohammed,

> But we came to know that some of the signatures by commercial vendors are

for that.

That's correct. The quality of signatures in the public domain is pretty
shabby, leading to a lot of false positives and negatives. The reason being
that most of it is volunteer effort with limited details on the exact nature
of the vulnerability being covered. To access better and precise signatures,
you would have to pay the price.

> In view of this, Can anyone help me with providing references to such commercial
vendors who provide paid subscription to IDS/IPS signatures. Our management

My company, Vikriya (www.vikriya.com) has just come out of stealth mode. We
are working on similar lines, and do active research and signature
development on new vulnerabilities and threats. We are have also prototyped
a multi-vendor vulnerability signature auto-push engine which works for
Snort too (vStrobe). Apart from that, our on-demand vulnerability management
platform (Genghis) and actionable threat intelligence portal (Trikaal) also
have an active database of threats, vulnerabilities and exploits.

Let me know if there's an avenue of cooperation here. We are looking for
mutually beneficial partnerships in feeding intelligence to Trikaal and
making our attack trends forecast more precise and actionable.

Dear Shri Alok Vijayant

You have refered the use of hacker for government purpose. Penetration testing with permission is ethical thing but doing the same without permission is not ethical. In OWASP we are together to help each other in removing the vulnerabilities from application and not developing malwares.

If you are really doing this on governemt behalf then why not send mail using your official mail ID. 
It will be easy for others to cooperate.

regards

Sushil Nehra

Greetings Sunil,

While I understand your concern for unscrupulous activities which happen
under the broad definition of hacking, I think tagging this term as
something which is explicitly criminal is unfair and uncalled-for. Hacking
has very intellectual roots and a long-long history, and if you give the
government the liberty of not getting swayed by the media and populist
propaganda (FUD - fear, uncertainty and doubt), then you can see that there
is a genuine scope of cooperation here.

When the President of US wanted an overhaul of cyber security and critical
infrastructure protection apparatus, they invited hackers, yes hackers like
L0pht's Mudge AKA Peiter Zatko to testify in the Congress. Let's move over
the myopic scope of jargon put forth by the populist media and FUD-mongers
and call hackers as hackers, and not black hat, white hat, ethical or some
other self-gratifying term.

My 2 cents with Alok. It's an initiative for which we will thank him in the
coming years, unless of course you want an short-sighted action from the
government like declaring wi-fi as illegal or something.

Best,
Pukhraj

Gents,
All good points. Though, call it scepticism or just paranoia (given the
field we are in), I concur with Sunil in that it seems a bit odd that 
 
1. A high ranking Gov. official would email to only the Delhi OWASP
list. One would think that this would be a broader initiative (I hang
out in quite a few security lists and haven't seen any equivalent
email). Although, it could be and we dont have the bigger picture in
front of us.
2. A high ranking Gov. official would float his contact info on a public
forum like this. 
3.  A high ranking Gov. official would email using his gmail id. (Point
raised by Sunil)
 
But putting these speculations aside, not to go on a tangent and steal
the thunder away from the real issue, I think everyone would appreciate
some more "transparency" (unless some list members (Pukhraj, Druv?) have
already met/spoken to Mr. Alok or have some deeper insight into this
initiative, which makes this a mute point) in this matter to extend
their co-operation. 
 
Mr. Alok - We are all ears. Help us help India.
 
thanks,

  - Jitesh Kamat

I collated two different aspects to counter not only Sushil's criticism, but
also the kind of feedback we've been getting offline. Deconstructing
Sushil's aforementioned paragraph, you can say that he's criticizing the
call for the open use of hackers or it could be related to the use of the
term 'hacker' (I am not sure due to some syntactic obscurity in the mail).
In the next sentence, he is apprehensive about hackers doing some intrusive
tests to check the susceptibility of critical infrastructure.

My point here is, we can learn a lot of from US policy on such issues. It
started the typical way, with L0pht declaring that they can bring down the
Internet in 30 minutes (due to a BGP hack), then these hackers doing
'penetration tests without permission' were called on by the government.
This was the first step in making of US cyber security policy. We are going
to witness same amount of connectivity here in India in the coming decade,
with control systems like SCADA becoming more prevalent. Let's learn, adapt
and move quickly. Being proactive is a hell lot cheaper then refurbishing
the whole goddamn vulnerable architecture. And on Alok's stance on the open
use of hackers (no hats barred), I say let's give them a direction and we
will get poster boys like l0pht, cDc, w00w00, Peiter Zatko, Marc Maiffret,
Kevin Poulsen, Chris Claus etc, of whom we will be proud of.

I criticized Sushil because for me, his mail symbolizes all that is
stereotypical and un-entrepreneurial about the government. While on the
other hand, I admire Alok's contrarian approach.

I won't stretch this too far...you can draw any conclusion you may like. I
am just keen on supporting Alok.

Best,
Pukhraj

I am also a bit suspicious of Alok Vijayant using his personal email
address, citing his mobile no. and requesting for security professionals to
mail him back on a one-to-one basis. These things do raise red flags in my
head. If this is an official initiative I would prefer if it came from his
official email address and we have some way of verifying that he is indeed
who he says he is and that whatever he is trying to do does have official
sanction.

When speaking to a group of techies I prefer to use the term hacker because
everybody knows what it means. But when communicating to a larger audience,
and I am not sure of their backgrounds I prefer using explicit terms such as
attacker, white-hat hacker, black-hat hacker etc. - the objective to
communication is that the recipient understands what one is trying to
communicate and I think it is better to be explicit than be misunderstood.

If this initiative is indeed genuine and Alok Vijayant is indeed who he says
he is then this is a commendable initiative, I hope it gets the right
support from all the right quarters and that it becomes a success.

Thanks.

Varun

Okay that's very good investigative work. Now why don't you give him a call,
propose an agenda and meetup at the GOI office where he is working.

What makes you believe that sarcasm will elicit the action and

Friends and countrymen,


I would be presenting on the following topic in the upcoming OWASP Delhi
meetup to be held on October 18th. I hope to see you there.

*Crossing the Chasm: Anatomy of Client-Side and Browser-Based Attacks*

* *

The last couple of years have witnessed a sea-change in the Internet threat
landscape. Not only has the cyber-crime model been heavily monetized, but
the attacks vectors have also become more and more sophisticated. One
category of exploitation which has upped the ante is client-side and
browser-based exploitation.



>From humble beginnings like the WMF debacle, attackers have come a long way
in luring unaware users into their vicious trap. Now, we see almost
business-like precision and efficiency in such shady dealings. From
thousands of malicious websites serving plethora of obfuscated exploits
cropping up everyday, to the compromise of popular and critical websites
which end up becoming the gateway of such nefarious activities, never before
has the Internet security community born the brunt of something so organized
and wide-scale.



Having investigated hundreds of such 'in-the-wild' cases and being at the
helm of affairs during incidents of global outbreak (WMF zero-day, IE VML
vulnerability, MPack automated exploitation toolkits, ANI zero-day, Xunlei
WebThunder zero-day, Peacomm propagation; to investigating the compromise of
websites of Indian government agencies like Defense Research and Development
Organization) has given Pukhraj a multifaceted view of the problem. It has
lend him a unique perspective as to why this is such a hard nut to crack ?
why contemporary security products fail in such situations, the modus
operandi of selling exploits in the underground, the escalation of
cyber-espionage, to the underlying architectural deficiencies in client-side
applications and browsers.



Pukhraj will share some his war-zone stories giving you an enthralling view,
right from the foxhole.





*Speaker's Bio:*

Pukhraj Singh is the Director of Products and Services at Vikriya, a
pioneering Indian company ideating some cutting-edge security products which
leverage the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.



Prior to Vikriya, he was working with Symantec Canada, as a member of the
industry's foremost and well-respected global security response and
actionable intelligence team responsible for managing the Symantec's
flagship service, The DeepSight Threat Management System. Prior to that, he
was the Project Manager and Chief Vulnerability Researcher at Third Brigade,
where he established their Indian security research base from ground up.



As a security professional, he has played varied roles in the past, from
working on the industry's first patch proxy IPS at Blue Lane Technologies to
performing penetration tests on leading banks and portals. He has spoken at
international security conferences (Hack-In-The-Box 2005,
CII-PricewaterhouseCoopers Business Security Summit, SyScAN 2005), academic
institutions, technology meets and professional security boot camps. His
articles are also cited in the leading information security resources (
www.SecurityFocus.com), journals and newspapers. He was also among the 60
innovators selected for the Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Program.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Collaboration on a nation-wide threat intelligence
	platform
Message-ID: <2a2430ae0810120917w640b548dm92b39f466cc564e6@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings All,

We are looking for active collaboration with various tier-1 service
providers and large academic/research/corporate networks ( >1000 nodes), to
join hands in building a nation-wide early-warning and actionable threat
intelligence platform. Our motive is not to build some kind of commercial
service, but to provide and share real-time intelligence for free with
various contributors and partners. We believe that this will set a good
precedent in tracking security incidents and attacks against our national
infrastructure.

To get a brief overview on the project, you can visit the following page:
http://www.vikriya.com/products/trikaal (Especially, read about A-NAME).

To make Anomalous Network Activity Mining Engine (A-NAME) more precise and
actionable, we need logs - tons and tons of logs from various kinds of
networks. We will crunch it, mine it and gather some really cool
intelligence and statistics out of it, apart from other avenues like smart
honeynets etc. We will corroborate and link-together all this information
from various tracking modules, to produce real-time data on various kinds of
attack statistics, which can be browsed through a slick Web 2.0-like portal.
We assure you that we will fully adhere to confidentiality issues and will
strip payload/content of the traffic completely, if needed. Our system can
do some nice heuristics from the packet header data itself. Such
collaboration will be done under a bulletproof NDA to avoid any
confidentiality leaks. Our sensors will have a zero-footprint on your
network and all data gathering will be done completely passively, so no
interventions.

I urge you mail me if you think you can contribute or can refer us to the
right people who can help. In return, you will not only get attack and
anomaly statistics from A-NAME, but also some really valuable information
and cutting-edge research on zero-days, new vulnerabilities, botnets,
phishing, malware, exploits and other security happenings from our threat
research analyst team. In short, if you contribute for one module, we will
give you returns from all the modules for free. We also hope to make this
system open to the general public later on.

Best,
Pukhraj Singh

Interesting concept.
 
Out of curiosity , could you expand on this? "It has added automation
and smartness which has the ability to detect zero-day exploits in the
wild."
 
How would Trikaal detect something for which there is no signature
(hence being labelled as a zero day)?

On the heuristics of the compromise. Even if it's a zero-day exploit
propagating in the wild, it will produce some systemic events after the
compromise which can be used to deduct if this activity had (or had not)
been seen previously, by corroborating it with our historical compromise
data and threat database. There's minimal and guaranteed (99.999999%) host
and/or network activity which happens once a malware compromises the system.
So any zero-day exploited actively in the wild (not talking about the ones
which l33t h4xors hide under their pillow), will be caught.

Vikriya's Threat Research Team has released a Threat Research Analysis of
the recently disclosed, remotely-exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability
affecting Trend Micro OfficeScan suite of applications (CVE-2008-2437). The
analysis provides technical description of the vulnerability, assembly-level
source code walk through, a proof-of-concept exploit and remediation
details.

Summary:
Trend Micro OfficeScan is susceptible to a remotely-exploitable stack-based
buffer overflow vulnerability which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
code with SYSTEM-level privileges. The vulnerability was discovered on
September 09, 2008 by Secunia Research. The vendor has issued associated
patches which remediate the vulnerability. Customers are advised to apply
the patches immediately and follow the remediation techniques mentioned in
this analysis.

Since the actual severity of the vulnerability has been considerably lowered
after one month of its disclosure and the patches being available; Vikriya
would like to share information regarding this vulnerability with the
general public.

Message-ID: <644031.1712.qm@web8316.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Greetings All,


I am trying to reproduce the issue, but php is reporting some error:
like: fail to open lang/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00; path=//lang.php.

vulnerable code is: 

include("lang/".$_SESSION['language']."/lang.php"); 

exploit is: ../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00; path=/ as the value of vulnerable paramter.

exploit link is:http://milw0rm.com/exploits/6641

After
observing this error i thought there must some issue with the
vulnerable application, so created a vulnerable php program whose details are:


<?php

include("lang/".$_GET[filename]."/lang.php");

?>


Then i send a GET a request:

GET /vulnerable php?filename=lang/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00; path=/

still, i am observing same error.

This
is happening because inside include function, there is an additon of 
/lang.php after the vulnerable parameter value in both case.

I am not able to understand how the author manage to view the contents of /etc/passwd by this method.

please help me out.

Thanks in advance.

Hi All,

  I am currently developing an authentication project in Java which
  requires few of the user credentials to be stored on client after
  successful registration. This is to enable the client to locally
  verify the userID and do other necassary computations before it is being 
sent
  to server. As of now, I am storing these in default cookies location
  at client. But if the user has disabled the  cookie option or clears
  the cookies then the authentication process cannot proceed. We are
  thinking that we can store the cookie in some other location other
  than the default location.

  In view of the above I have two queries.

  1) Is there any way to store the cookie in some different secret location 
(such
     as windows system directory etc.) from where the cookie can be read at 
login time.

  2) If we want to store the cookie in different location then how we 
cannot identify
     the type of operating system running at client (as Linux as client 
will have some
     different directory)

  I request you to kindly take some time out to give the best solution
  for the same.

Thanks & Regards

Did you check magic_quotes_gpc in /etc/php.ini? It defaults to "on" whereas,
it needs to be "off". I hope you aren't using php 6.0.0.

The vulnerable program you wrote as an alternative worked at my setup. Below
is the screenshot. Can you also check that Apache is it is not running under
chroot environment? I tested this on php version 5.1.6.

I am assuming you are looking at a web application (and not a thick
client application).

Below is not an answer to your question but a warning that I see.

1. Ensure you do not have any XSS issues in your app. More
confidential info on the client side more implications & risk

2. Look forward to parameter tampering of these credentials.

Can you elaborate a bit more on the requirement? The purpose?

The client environment (browser, OS etc.) is not under your control
and therefore you can never trust it. What you are trying to do is not
possible in case of a web application and even in the case of a thick
client application it should be near impossible. You might hide or
obfuscate your application's tokens but that is only going to make the
task of breaking the model a little more difficult, not impossible.

Can you give us some context on why you are doing what you are trying
to do? If all you want to do is store some data at the client location
(but not necessarily protect it or update it) you might want to
explore client-side storage technologies such as Google Gears, browser
plug-ins, Flash cookies etc.

Varun

Hi Harpreet,
 I'm Arjun and I designed a single sign on and registration server. So will try to use that experience to help as best I can undertsand.
 
 I think the approach requires re-validation of concepts. I've NOT mentioned how to do what you want, but probably a different way of doing things to achieve the same desired functionality.
 
You did not mention, ...but from cookie I assume your client is ONLY a Web Browser.
Having, assumed that; one has to respect the intention of a cookie and the requirement of the user to disable or remove it. By trying to find ways to prevent that, I as a user would be very upset OR Happy if I was a hacker and could derive valuable info from your cookie.
 
If it is a public site, your credibility is at risk where you try to find ways to work around the user having control over the cookies on their machine. I'd advise on any approach that leaves a bad taste is the user found out.
PLUS: When this may not be secure, you may be saving information; if copied could spoof the user and cause a vulnerability in your system.
You said 
<QUOTE>This is to enable the client to locally
  verify the userID and do other necassary computations before it is being
sent</QUOTE>
... what sort of 'computations' are you trying to avoid? If these are so complex, then you are trying to save a LOT of data on the cookie. Which is a very bad thing from a vulnerability perspective. The solution below, excludes this comment because I'm not clear of "computations" and I find it shady!
So what is the soluton? (excluding the requirement of doing complex computations)
Instead of trying to make this invisible to your user. Why not maintain all the information in the database against some ID/Pin. When the user registers, display the PIN or send an Email (Click on this link - the link contains the pin in non-encrypted or encrypted format as a parameter).
Actually; if your params can be put in a link then EMAIL is the best way. Putting the link in an EMAIL will provide a way of the process to be with users knowledge and consent.
 
Either way, commuinicate to the user that for their confidentiality the next time they visit the site that PIN should be used.
 
If it is an application for a specific client; you may want to work on a buy in from business that mandates the use of cookies on user machines. And since they know your application they can trust it.
 
Regards,
Arjun

I spoke at the last event and of course plugged OWASP. It would be great if
application security topics were presented more frequently at conferences.
The infrastructure firewall stuff is kinda boring..

Hi Harpreet,

Varun is absolutely right, but I am not agreed with the word NOT POSSIBLE, 
you may require bit more time and must spend valuable time in testing it.

If you can provide us some example or any sample that what actual your are 
looking for, then possibly we can provide some solution for this.

Hello friends,
If magic magic_quotes_gpc is on it will only restrict ' (single quote), i
mean it will stop ' (single quote ) by \ (back slash) or by one more single
quote.

selected candidates from the challenge during the next OWASP meetup, or
whenever we can get the time to gather.

I had sent an initial list of HDFC phish URLs to some people, but it seems
they they were brought down. I will source a couple of good links and will
get back to you soon.

Best,
Pukhraj

What are Magic Quotes?

 

When on, all ' (single-quote), " (double quote), \ (backslash) and NULL
characters are escaped with a backslash automatically. This is identical to
what addslashes() <http://in2.php.net/manual/en/function.addslashes.php>
does. 

There are three magic quote directives: 

*	magic_quotes_gpc
<http://in2.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc>
Affects HTTP Request data (GET, POST, and COOKIE). Cannot be set at runtime,
and defaults to on in PHP. See also get_magic_quotes_gpc()
<http://in2.php.net/manual/en/function.get-magic-quotes-gpc.php> . 
*	magic_quotes_runtime
<http://in2.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-runtim
e>  If enabled, most functions that return data from an external source,
including databases and text files, will have quotes escaped with a
backslash. Can be set at runtime, and defaults to off in PHP. See also
set_magic_quotes_runtime()
<http://in2.php.net/manual/en/function.set-magic-quotes-runtime.php>  and
get_magic_quotes_runtime()
<http://in2.php.net/manual/en/function.get-magic-quotes-runtime.php> . 
*	magic_quotes_sybase
<http://in2.php.net/manual/en/sybase.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-syba
se>  If enabled, a single-quote is escaped with a single-quote instead of a
backslash. If on, it completely overrides magic_quotes_gpc
<http://in2.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc> .
Having both directives enabled means only single quotes are escaped as ''.
Double quotes, backslashes and NULL's will remain untouched and unescaped.
See also ini_get() <http://in2.php.net/manual/en/function.ini-get.php>  for
retrieving its value. 

 

Source: http://in2.php.net/magic_quotes 

 

 

magic_quotes_gpc

Sets the magic_quotes state for GPC (Get/Post/Cookie) operations. When
magic_quotes are on, all ' (single-quote), " (double quote), \ (backslash)
and NUL's are escaped with a backslash automatically.

Hello friends,

If magic magic_quotes_gpc is on it will only restrict ' (single quote), i
mean it will stop ' (single quote ) by \ (back slash) or by one more single
quote.

Did you check magic_quotes_gpc in /etc/php.ini? It defaults to "on" whereas,
it needs to be "off". I hope you aren't using php 6.0.0. <http://6.0.0./>

Greetings All,


I am trying to reproduce the issue, but php is reporting some error:
like: fail to open lang/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00;
path=//lang.php.

vulnerable code is:

include("lang/".$_SESSION['language']."/lang.php");

exploit is: ../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00; path=/ as the value
of vulnerable paramter.

exploit link is:http://milw0rm.com/exploits/6641

After
observing this error i thought there must some issue with the
vulnerable application, so created a vulnerable php program whose details
are:


<?php

include("lang/".$_GET[filename]."/lang.php");

?>


Then i send a GET a request:

GET /vulnerable
php?filename=lang/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00; path=/

still, i am observing same error.

This
is happening because inside include function, there is an additon of
/lang.php after the vulnerable parameter value in both case.

I am not able to understand how the author manage to view the contents of
/etc/passwd by this method.

please help me out.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Further to my previous mail regarding my project on Authentication. Please 
find below a brief writeup of the project.


The project is based on a research paper published on "providing Two 
factor authentication" by one of our colleagues.



The second factor is considered as smart card (Javacard) in the paper. But 
as the cost of Javacard is high we have decided to simulate the smart card 
as SMART CARD FILE which is at present a txt file generated after each 
successful registration and containing the resultant hash computations. 
In actual implementation with hardware based smart card the authors 
proposed to issue a personalized smart card to each registered user 
through reliable channel (courier etc.). The personalization here includes 
some computations such as hash functions, XOR operations done using the 
user credentials (userID , password)



Registration Phase

At the time of registration, once the user finishes his registration 
formalities and submits it to the server, the server does some secret 
computations and writes it in a smart card file which is to be delivered 
to the registered user (according to the paper). But since we can't expect 
every user to have a removable media such as thumb drive etc. to download 
the software smart card, we are writing the file contents in the cookie 
and storing it on the user system. Moreover, if the user at registration 
time says that he is registering from a public place (cyber caf etc) then 
the cookie will be stored on the system for limited time period say 6 hrs 
before it automatically gets expired.



Login Phase

At login, if the user is accessing the account from his own PC, he enters 
his userID which is verified locally with contents of the cookie. If local 
verification is successful then the client sends it to server for 
validation. Upon successful validation at server, the server sends the 
password page where in the user enters his password which is also locally 
verified. After password verification, the client prepares a secret 
message using the validated values and sends it to the server. The server 
does validate it before providing the access to account.



If every time the user logs in from different systems then after user 
enters the ID, the system checks if his cookie is present. If it is not 
available then the server asks some secret questions (questions which are 
usually asked if user forgets password) to be answered by the user. If 
answers are correct then the server loads the smart card file as cookie 
from its backup to the client. The rest of the process of asking the user 
to enter password etc. follows as discussed above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MY PREVIOUS MAIL FOR REFERENCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi All,

  I am currently developing an authentication project in Java which
  requires few of the user credentials to be stored on client after
  successful registration. This is to enable the client to locally
  verify the userID and do other necassary computations before it is being
sent
  to server. As of now, I am storing these in default cookies location
  at client. But if the user has disabled the  cookie option or clears
  the cookies then the authentication process cannot proceed. We are
  thinking that we can store the cookie in some other location other
  than the default location.

  In view of the above I have two queries.

  1) Is there any way to store the cookie in some different secret location
(such
     as windows system directory etc.) from where the cookie can be read at
login time.

  2) If we want to store the cookie in different location then how we
cannot identify
     the type of operating system running at client (as Linux as client
will have some
     different directory)

  I request you to kindly take some time out to give the best solution
  for the same.

Thanks & Regards
Harpreet

Hi Pukhraj,
?
Your presentation was great. It wud have been great fun if u had shown something real (real exploitation). Atleast opening the WMF file in any HEX editor and showing different headers at various offsets.
?
I didn't get Phishing URL's attachment. Please forward it again.

Note: These are as fresh as beheaded chicken still struggling for life. So

I think it would be highly unfair for those who don't drool on beers!! Make
the challenge available for Sufis as well.Would Lassi in a night club be
good option?

Hi Pukhraj,
?
Your presentation was great. It wud have been great fun if u had shown something real (real exploitation). Atleast opening the WMF file in any HEX editor and showing different headers at various offsets.
?
I didn't get Phishing URL's attachment. Please forward it again.

Absolutely! As much as you can drink. We will host a beer shindig for the selected candidates from the challenge during the next OWASP meetup, or whenever we can get the time to gather. 

I had sent an initial list of HDFC phish URLs to some people, but it seems they they were brought down. I will source a couple of good links and will get back to you soon.

Best,
Pukhraj

Hi Harpreet,

To be honest I think this entire "two-factor authentication" project
has very shaky fundamentals. It is just one-factor authentication with
lot of stuff added on which "feels" like two-factor but is probably
not even good one-factor.

The user does not seem to be authenticated any more strongly that your
usual web registration, same band is used to deliver tokens for both
authentication mechanisms, the tokens are stored in an extremely weak
repository - the cookie, core design uses secret questions to
accommodate changing PCs, solution will not degrade gracefully and
many more. Also remember that cookies set by a particular server are
always sent by the browser when that site/server is visited so
anything you store in a cookies is more exposed than data sitting in a
file on your disk.

Here are a collection of quick links that illustrate what I am trying
to say. I want to pen a much longer email but unfortunately I do not
have the time right now, will try to do it later this week.

The Curse of the Secret Question

Soft tokens aren't tokens at all

The Failure of Two-Factor Authentication
http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/03/the_failure_of.html

More on Two-Factor Authentication
http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/04/more_on_twofact.html

Two-factor, especially OTP generators are expensive but there are a
no. of less expensive still decent enough solutions available.
Consider the grid (debit) cards used by ICICI, also consider the grid
card shown here. You can also use SMSes for out of band authentication
for high value transactions, though of course there are pros and cons
to each solution.

Tilak,

To avoid any accidental compromise, I am only mailing it to people who have
mailed me specifically asking for it. So now, I would be doing the due
diligence from my side on your said query.

Best,

Hello All,

I just returned from OWASP Asia conference held in Taipei (Taiwan) on
27th and 28th October 2008. There was participation from 1200+
attendees and that sounds really unbelievable! I and Pukhraj shared a
talk on client-side and browser-based attacks and it was really well
received... Pukhraj also chaired a panel on web application auditing -
manual or automatic or WAF way.

We have some really amazing and hilarious pictures for you. The
speakers party was totally awesome and lasted the whole night on both
the days.
