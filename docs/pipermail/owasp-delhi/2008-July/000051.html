<PRE>During one of my recent meetings with a prospective customer who is into
online business, I tried convincing him to get his web infrastructure
assessed. But company was satisfied and highly confident for being secured
by using HackerSafe. HackerSafe or any other automated assessment framework
can't be as effective as a manual assessment, where few human minds are at
work. But unfortunately, when it comes to information security, cost towards
convincing a customer and making him/her understand the worth of security
assessment is much higher than actually executing the assessment exercise. 

 

I just found few online articles and a video on HackerSafe and thought to
share with you (will surely, share these with that prospect as well :-))

Not PCI Compliant.

Many Thanks,
