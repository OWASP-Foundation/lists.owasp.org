Hi All,

Thanks for your suggestion and sorry for the late reply! :)

@Dhruv
What do you mean by destroying the cookie? Is it like adding a custom
cookie and not the default ASP.NET_SesssionId?

@Deepayan
I have forwarded your link to C# fix of the attack. Will update if that
works.

@Pankaj
I also suggested similar solution to the developers but as per them if
we'll invalidate the session and regenerate another one, the user will be
redirected to login page. I tried convincing them that you need to do this
at the time of login but they were quite rigid with their concept and thus
did not work out with this solution.

One solution I suggested them was:
http://palisade.plynt.com/issues/2010Apr/secure-coding-aspdotnet-p2/

Comments please!

Thanks

Your link contains the same solution which Dhruv had suggested
- abandoning the current cookie and adding a new cookie in the response.

And this won't redirect to a login page, as code itself will delete the
cookie, generate a new cookie and allow the user to log into the
application by redirecting/forwarding to the page which should come after
login.

You can create a POC and demo them the same.

Message-ID: <CAGEo0Nhg=HXeAv3_49AW62hUojmvM6xpwo5=+y2uELGqDjdmEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I am trying to configure SSL on Tomcat 6 and want to run my localhost on
https. I have created a self signed certificate and provided the same in
Tomcat's server.xml

After starting the server, using netstat I can see that port 8443 is in
listening mode but https://localhost:8443 is still not working.

I am sure I am missing something but not able to find it. Help!!

Are you simply trying to test it or planning for production?

For production, I think it would be good to place Apache with https in front as reverse proxy. In case, testing, did you check what does you Catalina log says?

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

well, I just want to test something for my localhost only so not going for
Apache right now.

I have posted this question
here<http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/9426/configuring-ssl-on-tomcat-6-for-localhost-setup>
too
but till now, no substantial replies. I am downloading the new version of
Tomcat altogether and trying it again from the step 1. will share the log
details as well. Thanks for responding.
