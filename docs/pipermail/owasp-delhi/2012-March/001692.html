<PRE>Dear Members,

 

Wanted to bring to your notice that All India Management Association (AIMA)
jointly with St Gallen Symposium, Switzerland is organizing a Conference on
&quot;Managing Risk: New Approach to Sustainable Growth&quot; on Wednesday, 21 March
2012, at ITC Hotel The Maurya, New Delhi.  KPMG are the Knowledge Partners
of this Conference.

 

Though the conference directly does not focus on Application Security, but
looks upon Risk Management as a whole for organisation building and will be
worth attending. It already has a great line-up of Corporate and
International speakers which is mentioned below :

 

.         Kapil Sibal, Union Minister of HRD and Communication &amp; IT,
Government of India

.         Kevin Roberts, CEO Worldwide, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi

.         Arun Maira, Member, Planning Commission, Government of India

.         Johan De La Rey, Partner, KPMG South Africa, IARCS Practice

.         Gautam Thapar, Chairman &amp; CEO, The Avantha Group

.         R Seshasayee, Executive Vice Chairman, Ashok Leyland

.         Preetha Reddy, Managing Director, Apollo Hospitals

.         Sudhir Vasudeva, Chairman &amp; Managing Director, ONGC Ltd

.         Gunit Chadha, Chief Executive Officer, Deutsche Bank AG India 

.         Rohit Bammi, Partner, Financial Risk Management, KPMG India

 

Agenda as on date is attached for your reference.

 

The Conference will create an independent platform to deliberate upon some
of the most critical risks being faced by organisations today, characterized
by highly complex and interconnected issues and challenges. The Conference
will examine how the world economy can embark on a new journey of discovery
in a post-crisis world and aims to enhance understanding of how a
comprehensive set of global risks are evolving, how their interaction
impacts a variety of stakeholders, and what trade-offs are involved in
managing them efficiently, which will allow organisations to survive and
even thrive in uncertainty and turbulence to shape a more secure and
resilient future leading to sustainable growth.

 

Your participations would be purely through invitation Chapter Members and
there will be no delegate fee applicable on the registrations. As only
limited seats are available, registrations would be accepted on
first-come-first-serve basis. Please do confirm your registrations using the
enclosed Reply Form at the earliest. 

 

Looking forward to hearing from you at the earliest possible.

 

 

With best wishes,

 

Nitin Saxena
