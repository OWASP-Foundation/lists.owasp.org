Hi Bhupendra,

If application is vulnerable to session fixation then exploitation is possible in your given scenario; though it is tough but it's possible. Please visit http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation for more details about this vulnerability and protection against it. Check first whether your application is vulnerable or not.

hi

I agree with Suman. Session fixation seems to be quite difficult but for an
experienced hacker it is quite easy to demonstrate.

For hijacking any application information about the Session ID of the
present session is required and during the hijacking process and
exploitation it is assumed the victims session remains valid.

Three steps are involved:
Step 1: Prospective Victim login in the application say ERP

Just as simple that victim use any type of Authentication mechanism say
password or digital certificate or real time token. Once the user login is
successful then this information about the valid session is stored in the
sessionID.

Step 2: Attacker gets the valid SessionID
If the attacker by any means get the (say 40 byte) of session ID; he can do
this by sniffing if victim and attacker are on same network. If they are in
different places in internet then other vulnerabilities like XSS or others
are required.

Step 3: Attacker uses the stolen SessionID.
Attacker tries to access the page that can be accessed only after login. But
during this process the replaces his own session ID with the Stolen
SessionID. This way he is granted access in the Application and can make any
changes.


For mitigation
---------------------------
One of many of the mechanisms can be used:
1. Every pages visited after login on server throws a random token( random
number) embeded in the page. And the next request from client/browser should
contain that random number along with session ID else the application logoff
the user.
(This is done during the development of application)

2. Use https with valid certificate, with the application so that sniffing
and man in the middle to dont get the sessionID.
(Webserver - to avoid stealing of sessionID)

3. Application should be free from XSS and related vulnerabilities.
( Application -to avoid stealing of sessionID)

4. Assuming that passwords are sent in encrypted format with challenge
response.
( application)

5. Even if the attacker gets the sessionID he will not be use it if random
tokens are used in designing the application (see point 1 above)

Note: The Screen Saver does not protect the valid session from hijacking as
the attacker is not going to use your PC for attack. He only need sometime
to hijack and wants a fair amount of time to do his tricks. So always logoff
the critical application like financial ones once u use it and do not open
another mail or non trusted site in other browser tab.

Best practice: Use one type of browser (eg firefox) for financial appliation
like banking etc and never use it for other surfing and use other browser(
say IE) for general surfing.

Hi,

Very powerfully explained!!!

Just to add one note- it is always recommended to keep idle session timeout as minimum as possible, especially if application is dealing with financial transactions.

Bhupendra, I hope these details will suffice to cope up with your current scenario.

Regards
Suman

Hi All,

Can any one plz explain the threats present in a specific scenario as explained below:

User has logged-on in certain ERP application to carry out some transactions. ERP application has been configured for Automatic logoff after prolong idle time of 2 hrs. However desktop is set to get locked after idle time of 5 minutes.
After idle time of 5 minutes when desktop is locked, Can anyone from remote misuse/hacked the logged ERP application / session and carry out unauthorised activities.  If Yes, How ? and What are ways to protect from such a scenario.

Thanks all your support and coordination.

Hi Parmendra,

Please go through the link http://www.vulnerabilityassessment.co.uk/Penetration%20Test.html , this is an overall pentest framework. In one of the section it explains about steps and tools for pen test of mail server.

I hope you'll find this useful.

Regards
Suman

Apart from standard assessment of mail server to check for vulnerabilities in the SMTP/POP3/IMAP/OS software there are few mail server specific test like open relay, mail spoofing, usage of plain text protocols, user harvesting VRFY (SMTP command), Brute Force Prevention to POP3/SMTP/webmail, Malware Evasion, SPAM Tests, Information Leakage in bounced messages, webmail security, password policies etc.

 

Hope Helpful.

Open relay is when server allows to send emails to external domains using
any email address. Mail Spoofing is when you send emails as abc at domain.com
to abc at domain.com or xyz at domain.com (target). But when you try sending to
abc at yahoo.com (external) it would say "Relay Access Denied" which means open
relay is blocked but "logged in" status is not being checked. You may refer
to "POP before SMTP" mitigation and there are other techniques as well.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

thats right vaibhav..
 
I was meant to place authentication control in between.. if we block
relay there is no use to have SMTP.
 
since it was mentioned below: test like open relay, mail spoofing, both
are interconnected.  We test open relay to prevent mail spoofing.

Hello Raj.
 
If you block there Relay you will not able to send the mails. Then there
will be no use of SMTP.
Kindly refer to SMTP AUTH, to stop Open Mail Relay.

I think there is slight confusion between both the tests. Below are the test
cases for open relay and spoofing. Apart from open relay, you may try to do
local relay and SMTP implementation shall allow to send email as
abc at domain.com to abc at domain.com without asking for credentials.

 

Simple Open Relay Testing

=====

telnet mail.domain.com 25

mail from:spammer at evil.com

rcpt to:vicimemail at domain.com

data

some text in the email

.

quit

=====

 

Above mail will throw an error stating "550 Relay Access Denied" if the
server is running with SMTP AUTH. Else email will be delivered. 

 

 

Mail Spoofing Test - Even with SMTP AUTH, let us say you have valid
credentials (abc at domain.com) and you try to send the email as ceo at domain.com
as From address in your outlook:

telnet mail.domain.com 25

AUTH PLAIN AHRlc3QAdGVzdDEyMzQ=

mail from:ceo at domain.com

rcpt to:vicimemail at domain.com

data

You are fired with immediate effect. Some more text in the email.

.

quit

====

 

If mail server is not doing the login checks, above mail will pass due to
the correct credentials valid to some other mailbox. Else you will see an
error message "Access Denied: victimemail at domain.com: mailbox ceo at domain.com
not owned by the user"

 

Hope helpful!

thats right vaibhav..

 

I was meant to place authentication control in between.. if we block relay
there is no use to have SMTP.

 

since it was mentioned below: test like open relay, mail spoofing, both are
interconnected.  We test open relay to prevent mail spoofing.

Hello Raj.

 

If you block there Relay you will not able to send the mails. Then there
will be no use of SMTP.

Kindly refer to SMTP AUTH, to stop Open Mail Relay.

 Hi All,

 

I need to have one clarification here regarding open relay, mail spoofing;
Is it possible to perform mail spoofing if open relay is blocked on a mail
server.

Hi,

 

Thanks for the comments.

 

but what i was asking is there any specific "methodology/Guideline/How to"
to test such issues.

Apart from standard assessment of mail server to check for vulnerabilities
in the SMTP/POP3/IMAP/OS software there are few mail server specific test
like open relay, mail spoofing, usage of plain text protocols, user
harvesting VRFY (SMTP command), Brute Force Prevention to POP3/SMTP/webmail,
Malware Evasion, SPAM Tests, Information Leakage in bounced messages,
webmail security, password policies etc.

 

Hope Helpful.

The attached screenshot doesn't show defaced twitter. I guess the 
defaced twitter that you are referring to is here: 
http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10418140-93.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20

In any case, I tend to avoid terming "defacement" as "hacking". Just a 
personal preference.

A German computer engineer said Monday that he had deciphered and published
the secret code used to encrypt most of the world's digital mobile phone
calls, saying it was his attempt to expose weaknesses in the security of
global wireless systems.

The action by the encryption expert, Karsten Nohl, aimed to question the
effectiveness of the 21-year-old G.S.M. algorithm, a code developed in 1988
and still used to protect the privacy of 80 percent of mobile calls
worldwide.

A German computer engineer said Monday that he had deciphered and published
the secret code used to encrypt most of the world's digital mobile phone
calls, saying it was his attempt to expose weaknesses in the security of
global wireless systems.

The action by the encryption expert, Karsten Nohl, aimed to question the
effectiveness of the 21-year-old G.S.M. algorithm, a code developed in 1988
and still used to protect the privacy of 80 percent of mobile calls
worldwide.

Am sure when the algo was devised it was known mathematically that a break would exist.

The issue goes beyond technology; since commercially there are millions of phones with pre programmed chips and micro controllers perhaps that won't be compatible with any new algo. I think that's the main reason why that algo still exists and with continue to exist for a while. So the change may take a while to phase in.

Also, given what you know how many can exploit it? Infact the more interesting logical question is "how do u exploit it?"

Agreed on both points!!!

I have found something interesting while researching this issue http://reflextor.com/trac/a51.

Finally as an appsec adviser of banking group I can say (may be it is early) it's a challenge for our next generation banking technology i.e. "mobile banking".
