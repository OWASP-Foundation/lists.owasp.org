Greetings OWASP Members!

 

After the successful launch of OWASP in India with OWASP AppSec India
Conference 2008, we would like to continue with the spirit of getting
together for common goal of fighting with the insecure code. With your
active support and participation, we intend to plan out monthly OWASP
meetings in the NCR region. Participation into these meetings will be free
of cost and is open to everyone whosoever is concerned about application
security. If you have any burning AppSec topic that you would like to share
with others or you want to demonstrate the power of some AppSec
assessment/educational tool that helped you in keeping your application
secured, then you may submit your presentation in the attached template to
Delhi Chapter Board. 

 

These meetings will be of short duration (3hrs) occurring on weekends (most
likely Saturday evening). Incase, your company would like to sponsor these
meetings in terms of venue and snacks accommodating 70-100 participants then
kindly let us know. Your company logo will be carried over the chapter
meeting page on OWASP website as a prime sponsor. 

 

CFP (Call For Papers) is open for upcoming OWASP Delhi Chapter Meeting, so
submit your papers now!! Venue and timing for this particular meeting is yet
to be finalized and we hope to fix it up for mid of October 2008. 

 

Please feel free to share your thoughts over the same to help the community
taking maximum benefits out of such meetings.

 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Hi Dhruv,
 
I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any
certificates mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in
Delhi. If not physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a
record, especially if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

Hi Dhruv,
 
I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any
certificates mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in
Delhi. If not physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a
record, especially if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

Greetings OWASP Members!

After the successful launch of OWASP in India with OWASP AppSec India
Conference 2008, we would like to continue with the spirit of getting
together for common goal of fighting with the insecure code. With your
active support and participation, we intend to plan out monthly OWASP
meetings in the NCR region. Participation into these meetings will be
free of cost and is open to everyone whosoever is concerned about
application security. If you have any burning AppSec topic that you
would like to share with others or you want to demonstrate the power of
some AppSec assessment/educational tool that helped you in keeping your
application secured, then you may submit your presentation in the
attached template to Delhi Chapter Board. 

These meetings will be of short duration (3hrs) occurring on weekends
(most likely Saturday evening). Incase, your company would like to
sponsor these meetings in terms of venue and snacks accommodating 70-100
participants then kindly let us know. Your company logo will be carried
over the chapter meeting page on OWASP website as a prime sponsor. 

CFP (Call For Papers) is open for upcoming OWASP Delhi Chapter Meeting,
so submit your papers now!! Venue and timing for this particular meeting
is yet to be finalized and we hope to fix it up for mid of October 2008.


Please feel free to share your thoughts over the same to help the
community taking maximum benefits out of such meetings.

Hi Surinder,
 
I think we got confused here. I have the link to the presentations in
pdf format.
I was referring to the participation certificates so that we can keep
the same as a record for claiming CPE (continuing professional
education) points with ISC2 and ISACA. Also in most ISC2 sponsored
events the CPEs are calculated and added automatically to your ISC2
member id.
On day 2, I saw a lot of participation certificates lying on the owasp
representative tables and I was told the same will be duly signed by the
presenters and mailed to all the attendees. If physical copies cannot be
mailed, I would expect pdfs scans of the certificates (for day 1 and day
2) for our record.
For claiming CPEs, both ISC2 and ISACA mandate retaining a record which
indicates the timelines of the event as well as the fact that one
satisfactorily attended the same.
 
Cheers,
jatin

Also given that ISC2 was a sponsor, the CPEs for ISC2 should have been
automatically added.

Hi  Dhruv,
 
Same like  Jatin, On day 2, I have also seen a lot of participation
certificates lying on the owasp representative tables and I was told
that these cerficates are for the persons Who are attending training
session of Mr.. Manu Paul (ISC 2 advisor).  Need one clarification Why
participation certificate are not distributed for other trainings?
But from mails from Jatin ,it seems that no certifications had been
distributed for participation for  Mr.. Manu Paul session as well
.also,I was trying to get PDF link for second day presentations which
are still pending.
 
Agree with Jatin that participation certificates must be distributed for
this kind of events as this is required for CPE. 
 
regards,
Surinder Kumar

Hi Dhruv,
 
I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any certificates 
mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in Delhi. If not 
physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a record, 
especially if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

Thats strange I did not get any pdf link for day 1 or day 2. I would
appreciate if a pdf link can be provided for both days to all attendees. 

Also given that ISC2 was a sponsor, the CPEs for ISC2 should have been
automatically added.

All,
 
In regards to CPE credits. ISC2 members can claim 1 CPE / hour of attendance to the event. The same CPE's will not be automatically added to your certification cycle as the same practice has been stopped by ISC2 at all its sponsored events. This facility is only available for Surveys /events that are conducted directly by ISC2 for its members. 
 
For any other certification body such as ISACA, you may refer to CPE guidelines for the calculation of number of CPE's you can claim towards event attendance.
 
As per below email from Dhruv, please take out 5 minutes to fill in the Participant Satisfaction survey. This will enable us to make our next OWASP AppSec India 2009 more better. Once we recieve your feedback , the certificates will be dispatched.
 
At this time i would also request you to participate actively in the upcoming chapter meetings. The CFP is open now and we request the Appsec Pro's to come forward and share thier knowledge in chapter meetings.

Thats strange I did not get any pdf link for day 1 or day 2. I would
appreciate if a pdf link can be provided for both days to all attendees. 

Also given that ISC2 was a sponsor, the CPEs for ISC2 should have been
automatically added.

Hi Dhruv,

 

I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any certificates
mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in Delhi. If not
physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a record, especially
if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

Greetings OWASP Members!

After the successful launch of OWASP in India with OWASP AppSec India
Conference 2008, we would like to continue with the spirit of getting
together for common goal of fighting with the insecure code. With your
active support and participation, we intend to plan out monthly OWASP
meetings in the NCR region. Participation into these meetings will be free
of cost and is open to everyone whosoever is concerned about application
security. If you have any burning AppSec topic that you would like to share
with others or you want to demonstrate the power of some AppSec
assessment/educational tool that helped you in keeping your application
secured, then you may submit your presentation in the attached template to
Delhi Chapter Board. 

These meetings will be of short duration (3hrs) occurring on weekends (most
likely Saturday evening). Incase, your company would like to sponsor these
meetings in terms of venue and snacks accommodating 70-100 participants then
kindly let us know. Your company logo will be carried over the chapter
meeting page on OWASP website as a prime sponsor. 

CFP (Call For Papers) is open for upcoming OWASP Delhi Chapter Meeting, so
submit your papers now!! Venue and timing for this particular meeting is yet
to be finalized and we hope to fix it up for mid of October 2008. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts over the same to help the community
taking maximum benefits out of such meetings.

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Hi Dhruv,

 

I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any certificates mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in Delhi. If not physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a record, especially if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

Greetings OWASP Members!

After the successful launch of OWASP in India with OWASP AppSec India Conference 2008, we would like to continue with the spirit of getting together for common goal of fighting with the insecure code. With your active support and participation, we intend to plan out monthly OWASP meetings in the NCR region. Participation into these meetings will be free of cost and is open to everyone whosoever is concerned about application security. If you have any burning AppSec topic that you would like to share with others or you want to demonstrate the power of some AppSec assessment/educational tool that helped you in keeping your application secured, then you may submit your presentation in the attached template to Delhi Chapter Board. 

These meetings will be of short duration (3hrs) occurring on weekends (most likely Saturday evening). Incase, your company would like to sponsor these meetings in terms of venue and snacks accommodating 70-100 participants then kindly let us know. Your company logo will be carried over the chapter meeting page on OWASP website as a prime sponsor. 

CFP (Call For Papers) is open for upcoming OWASP Delhi Chapter Meeting, so submit your papers now!! Venue and timing for this particular meeting is yet to be finalized and we hope to fix it up for mid of October 2008.

Hello Puneet,

It has been more than 2 weeks since I filled this Participant Satisfaction Survey. Any idea as to by when can I expect the delivery of participant certificates?

All,

In regards to CPE credits. ISC2 members can claim 1 CPE / hour of attendance to the event. The same CPE's will not be automatically added to your certification cycle as the same practice has been stopped by ISC2 at all its sponsored events. This facility is only available for Surveys /events that are conducted directly by ISC2 for its members.

For any other certification body such as ISACA, you may refer to CPE guidelines for the calculation of number of CPE's you can claim towards event attendance.

As per below email from Dhruv, please take out 5 minutes to fill in the Participant Satisfaction survey. This will enable us to make our next OWASP AppSec India 2009 more better. Once we recieve your feedback , the certificates will be dispatched.

At this time i would also request you to participate actively in the upcoming chapter meetings. The CFP is open now and we request the Appsec Pro's to come forward and share thier knowledge in chapter meetings.

Should you have any further concerns, you may write to us at dhruv.soi at owasp.org<mailto:dhruv.soi at owasp.org> OR puneet.mehta at owasp.org<mailto:puneet.mehta at owasp.org> .

Thanks

Dear All,

The mail is intended for the delegates who have attended the "OWASP Application Security India Conference 2008" held at India Habitat Centre, Lodhi Road, New Delhi on August 20th and August 21st, 2008.

We wish to request you once again to kindly take out 5minutes of your precious time to fill up the feedback form of the conference. The same is available on the below mentioned URL :

https://efm.pulseware.com.au/survey.asp?r=800136&vp=834A2b3a4C

The delegates who have already submitted the feedbacks, which are necessary for us, need not re-do it again.

For your information we have uploaded some of the conference presentations on our Chapter Website for your future reference and the same can be downloaded from the below URL:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_India_Conference_2008_Presentations
We are not authorized to upload rest of the presentations without written consent of the trainers/speakers. Incase you need those presentations then we suggest you to kindly get in touch with the respective speaker/trainer. We are waiting for the feedbacks from your side those we need to collate and share with the speakers/trainers. Once we are through with this task, we will soon dispatch all the certificates via courier.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Thats strange I did not get any pdf link for day 1 or day 2. I would appreciate if a pdf link can be provided for both days to all attendees.
Also given that ISC2 was a sponsor, the CPEs for ISC2 should have been automatically added.

Hi Dhruv,

I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any certificates mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in Delhi. If not physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a record, especially if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

Hello Puneet,
 
It has been more than 2 weeks since I filled this Participant

All,
 
In regards to CPE credits. ISC2 members can claim 1 CPE / hour of
attendance to the event. The same CPE's will not be automatically added
to your certification cycle as the same practice has been stopped by
ISC2 at all its sponsored events. This facility is only available for
Surveys /events that are conducted directly by ISC2 for its members. 
 
For any other certification body such as ISACA, you may refer to CPE
guidelines for the calculation of number of CPE's you can claim towards
event attendance.
 
As per below email from Dhruv, please take out 5 minutes to fill in the
Participant Satisfaction survey. This will enable us to make our next
OWASP AppSec India 2009 more better. Once we recieve your feedback , the
certificates will be dispatched.
 
At this time i would also request you to participate actively in the
upcoming chapter meetings. The CFP is open now and we request the Appsec
Pro's to come forward and share thier knowledge in chapter meetings.
 
Should you have any further concerns, you may write to us at
dhruv.soi at owasp.org OR puneet.mehta at owasp.org . 
 
Thanks
Puneet Mehta

Dear All,

The mail is intended for the delegates who have attended the "OWASP
Application Security India Conference 2008" held at India Habitat
Centre, Lodhi Road, New Delhi on August 20th and August 21st, 2008. 
We wish to request you once again to kindly take out 5minutes of your
precious time to fill up the feedback form of the conference. The same
is available on the below mentioned URL :

https://efm.pulseware.com.au/survey.asp?r=800136&vp=834A2b3a4C 
The delegates who have already submitted the feedbacks, which are
necessary for us, need not re-do it again.
For your information we have uploaded some of the conference
presentations on our Chapter Website for your future reference and the
same can be downloaded from the below URL: 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_India_Conference_2008_Prese
ntations 
We are not authorized to upload rest of the presentations without
written consent of the trainers/speakers. Incase you need those
presentations then we suggest you to kindly get in touch with the
respective speaker/trainer. We are waiting for the feedbacks from your
side those we need to collate and share with the speakers/trainers. Once
we are through with this task, we will soon dispatch all the
certificates via courier. 
 
Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Thats strange I did not get any pdf link for day 1 or day 2. I would
appreciate if a pdf link can be provided for both days to all attendees.

Also given that ISC2 was a sponsor, the CPEs for ISC2 should have been
automatically added.

Hi Dhruv,
 
I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any
certificates mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in
Delhi. If not physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a
record, especially if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

Greetings OWASP Members!
After the successful launch of OWASP in India with OWASP AppSec India
Conference 2008, we would like to continue with the spirit of getting
together for common goal of fighting with the insecure code. With your
active support and participation, we intend to plan out monthly OWASP
meetings in the NCR region. Participation into these meetings will be
free of cost and is open to everyone whosoever is concerned about
application security. If you have any burning AppSec topic that you
would like to share with others or you want to demonstrate the power of
some AppSec assessment/educational tool that helped you in keeping your
application secured, then you may submit your presentation in the
attached template to Delhi Chapter Board. 
These meetings will be of short duration (3hrs) occurring on weekends
(most likely Saturday evening). Incase, your company would like to
sponsor these meetings in terms of venue and snacks accommodating 70-100
participants then kindly let us know. Your company logo will be carried
over the chapter meeting page on OWASP website as a prime sponsor. 
CFP (Call For Papers) is open for upcoming OWASP Delhi Chapter Meeting,
so submit your papers now!! Venue and timing for this particular meeting
is yet to be finalized and we hope to fix it up for mid of October 2008.

Please feel free to share your thoughts over the same to help the
community taking maximum benefits out of such meetings.
Many Thanks,
Dhruv
