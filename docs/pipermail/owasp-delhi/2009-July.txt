Nope!
Not unless you explicitly put the session variable in to a form field or 
something in which case it becomes a GET or POST variable.
If 'register_globals' is turned ON then you might be able to SET Session 
variables but not read their values.

In general no. Session variables are stored on the server-side and are by
default not sent (and should not be sent) to the browser. The session
identifier is the only value that is bounced back and forth between the web
application and the browser to maintain the session. Since session variable
are not sent to the browser they cannot be intercepted and tampered with.

Of course if the web application also sends a value from the session to the
browser side (either because it is needed or because of poor application
design) then you can possibly intercept it and change it.

If you tell us the context of your query we might be able to answer the
question better. Thanks.

Somebody told me that the following site has a very good repository.

I know little about security testing, but I am sure it can be of some help
if you read.

Hope this helps :)

hi OWASP Delhi,



Has Buffer Overflow vulnerability become 'history' for web applications developed in JAVA and .Net ? how java and .Net protect from buffer overflow ? Does it exist for applications developed in Php, Perl, asp etc ?  how to detect by manual testing ?



thanks & regards,

Suresh,

 Buffer overflows occur when more data is written to memory than was
allocated by the program.
In other words, the programmer was responsible for properly managing memory
and made a common error.
It doesn?t take much of an overflow to impact a system. As little as one
byte of data can cause a security incident.
The scary thing is, buffer overflow vulnerabilities are one of the most
popular targets of criminal hackers.
These days buffer attacks have become more of a history.The reason is simple
: Java,ASP.Net,PHP,(perl not sure),
the entire *memory management is done by the frameworks* like JVM,.NET
frameworks 2.0/3.4/4.0 etc.
These frameworks are standardised products and rigousously tested at
multiple levels. So buffer attacks even though* might not be ruled out
completely*,*occur very very rarely.*

Hope this helps.


regards,
Bhaskar

Hi Suresh;


For java based web application with the help of multi threading it can be
easily protected.( Throws and Exceptions)
For manual testing  u can try to execute arbitary code on the application
like php,perl etc

Hi

The intention of the blogpost was to talk about PA-DSS, which Visa's  
article doesn't talk about. Anyway with reference to the infection. I  
have removed the padded code from the Gumblar worm article. Some AVs  
throw it up in the red even if it is adequately padded.

Issue: "Broken Access Control" v/s "Insecure Direct Object Reference"



Dear OWASP Delhi,



Thank you all for the overwhelming response to my queries and doubts.



"Broken Access Control" v/s "Insecure Direct Object Reference"



OWASP 2007 version does not have Broken Access Control, so how do we go about if there are broken access control issues in a site ? how do we report it ? Also the basic difference between broken access control and insecure direct object reference. sometimes, it appears that there is a very thin line between them. Pls clarify.



thanks & regards,

Suresh

Hi Shakun,

 

    As far as Frame injection is concerned, it comprises of two terms
'frame' and 'injection'.

Basically <iframe> tags are used for it as it is treated as invisible
frame. So Frame injection is injection of various frames in a page that
can download malicious executable application that may contain virus or
worms.

Finding frame injection in a page is easy. Check the 'View Source' of
the HTML pages returned by the server and look for frame or iframe tags.
If you find something suspicious like IPs or contents you have to
manually remove them. This was a brief introduction to frame injection.

 

As far as Session Replay is concerned, if your session is very much
valid even after you have logged out of the application or if an
attacker manages to capture your sessionID then he may relogin using
your sessionID . This is session replay attack. So the sessionID
assigned to you by the server must be valid for your particular session
with the application only. As soon as you log out of the application it
should be invalidated so that it can't be replayed by anyone by
capturing it. Also the sessionID must be regenerated in next
'successful' login and must be long and random in nature.

 

Hope this helps

Hi Nilesh

 

Can u please explain it in more detail? How it happens and how these hackers
are able to insert iframe tags in html files while they do not have write
permission to write on server. How they modify the contents in html or php
files. 

 

Please help us in understanding this security threat.

I can't explain more specifically in your case but as a general rule if
your application is not validating or filtering user input properly then
scripts can be entered or injections can be entered for example, SQL
injection.

Exploiting that flaw <iframe> tag too can be injected in the application
and if the application having any forum or message box it can be stored
permanently using scripts. The source of iframe can be any malicious
link or IP containing malicious contents. Attackers can give malicious
links as inputs to a GET or POST that will get loaded into a frame or
iFrame and compromise user security.

 

This is one of the ways to exploit the issue. 

 

And even if a hacker manages to break in your server-as per your
assumption-he will try to break access control mechanism of server.
Although I can't shed more light on this. I am sorry for that.

 

Hope this helps.

Lets take a case of any forum where any user can post a message or reply. If
the user's input is not filtered, a malicious user can enter such codes
which can make the server parse the code and the code will be executed
everytime the post is viewed. As an example, if the user can make the server
parse  <script>alert("hacked");</script> everytime the post is viewed, a
JavaScript alert saying "hacked" will be executed. Similarly with <iframe>.

Hi,

Recently my PC got infected with W32.virut virus. This virus inserted <iframe> in all the html files on system. Attached is the screen shot of the <iframe>.

I can?t explain more specifically in your case but as a
general rule if your application is not validating or filtering user input
properly then scripts can be entered or injections can be entered for example, SQL
injection.
Exploiting that flaw <iframe> tag too can be injected in
the application and if the application having any forum or message box it can
be stored permanently using scripts. The source of iframe can be any malicious
link or IP containing malicious contents.Attackers can give malicious
links as inputs to a GET or POST that will get loaded into a frame or iFrame
and compromise user security.
 
This is one of the ways to exploit the issue. 
 
And even if a hacker manages to break in your server?as per
your assumption?he will try to break access control mechanism of server.
Although I can?t shed more light on this. I am sorry for that.
 
Hope this helps.

Hi Nilesh
 
Can u please explain it in more detail? How it happens and how
these hackers are able to insert iframe tags in html files while they do not
have write permission to write on server. How they modify the contents in html
or php files. 
 
Please help us in understanding
this security threat.

Hi Shakun,
 
    As far as Frame injection is
concerned, it comprises of two terms ?frame? and
?injection?.
Basically <iframe> tags are used for it as it is treated
as invisible frame. So Frame injection is injection of various frames in a page
that can download malicious executable application that may contain virus or
worms.
Finding frame injection in a page is easy. Check the ?View
Source? of the HTML pages returned by the server and look for frame or
iframe tags. If you find something suspicious like IPs or contents you have to
manually remove them. This was a brief introduction to frame injection.
 
As far as Session Replay is concerned, if your session is very
much valid even after you have logged out of the application or if an attacker
manages to capture your sessionID then he may relogin using your sessionID .
This is session replay attack. So the sessionID assigned to you by the server
must be valid for your particular session with the application only. As soon as
you log out of the application it should be invalidated so that it can?t
be replayed by anyone by capturing it. Also the sessionID must be regenerated
in next ?successful? login and must be long and random in nature.
 
Hope this helps

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Need Code for sanitizing inputs in PHP
Message-ID: <74abbcd30907290743t33a710c2s17692f0d59f717a9@mail.gmail.com>

hi list,
I am looking for code for sanitizing each and every input for SQL injection
and XSS in PHP

I need a function say sanitize(<input>), where <input> would be a
value which user is supplying in
the web page.

this sanitize function should return the sanitized value after
removing all possible sql injection
and xss strings.


another way could be, sanitize(input) should return true (if no
malicious string found) or false (if some malicious string is found)

any help is appreciated.

regards
abhi

Do you have any idea on 'Regular Expressions'?

hi OWASP Delhi,



how do we handle "true negatives" existing in an application for SQL Injection and XSS ? Automated scanning may not show true negatives and so security testers shall leave them. So how do we handle it. 



thanks & regards,
