Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] KBA-MP Project seeks volunteers
Message-ID: <CAAvjMhOKSBa1PtGdQ9JyJhPcCPg-chZt7gkRYT0w2C+mygxBwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The KBA-MP Project seeks participants with identity management and/or
standards development experience. Join here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Knowledge_Based_Authentication_Performance_Metrics_Project

The KBAPM Project

There is a lack of standard performance metrics regarding the use of
knowledge based authentication (KBA) for remote identity proofing. KBAPMP's
goal is to establish standard performance metrics for knowledge based
authentication.
What is Knowledge Based Authentication?

Knowledge-based authentication, commonly referred to as KBA, is a method of
authentication which seeks to prove the identity of someone accessing a
service, such as a website. As the name suggests, KBA requires the
knowledge of personal information of the individual to grant access to the
protected material. There are two types of KBA: "static KBA", which is
based on a pre-agreed set of "shared secrets"; and "dynamic KBA", which is
based on questions generated from a wider base of personal information.
KBAPM Project Supports the NSTIC Guiding Principles

KBAPM Project is dedicated to developing KBA Standards in alignment the the
NSTIC Guiding Principle. To that end KBAPM Project has answered the IDESG
Standards Committee Solicitation to develop Knowledge Based Authentication
Performance Metric Standards.


For more information contact the Project Leader, Ann Racuya-Robbins, at
arr at worldknowldegebank.com.


Thanks

Hello leaders,

We have received a request for a panelist to speak InfoSecurity in London,
June 2015:

http://www.reedexpo.com/en/Events/4031/Infosecurity-Europe

The session will be held at 15.30-16.25 on Tuesday 2 June and is described
below. Please forward this message along to your chapter or project list,
or if you know someone who would be a good candidate, let me know.

I have also asked the InfoSecurity conference producers to review our OWASP
Speakers Project page where OWASP members can indicate their availability
to speak on a variety of topics. I encourage all OWASP members to add ther
name to this list if you would like to represent OWASP at events. Speaking
at events is a great way to network and get professional exposure. Also,
OWASP Foundation has limited funding available for speaker's travel if the
hosting org doesn't cover everything, so be sure to check that out as well.

Secure Development Panel Discussion for InfoSecurity/London:

>From DevOps to DevSec: Securing application development

Rapid innovation, agile software development and speed to market of new
mobile and web applications have never been greater priorities for
enterprises. As a result security is often compromised as developers are
pushed to code quickly and business growth and competitive advantage are
prioritised.  Software development and security teams continue to work in
siloes with product managers, with no security expertise, driving the
development of applications. Communication failures between the business
and security continue to result in hastily developed mobile and web apps,
leaving the organisation exposed to data leakage. So what are the obstacles
to achieving secure development and how can they be overcome? How can
security and development work together to ensure that security is built in
at the design stage? What is the role of DevOps in achieving secure
applications?

During this session the panel will assess the security challenges
associated with agile development and discuss steps you can take to
minimise the risk within your organisation.

*Evaluate the vulnerabilities of unsecured applications and how to protect
against them

* Understand DevOps and how it can be used to embed security into the
development cycle

* Discover how to communicate security to key stakeholders and collaborate
to ensure that security is prioritised in the design and development
process and applications are secure

* Establish contractual best practices when working with offshore and third
party developers

* Get to grips with the governance and compliance issues around security
for agile software development

Anyone who is interested and willing to travel to London in June, please
send me a bio to forward on to the InfoSecurity conference planners. And
thanks for passing along to your chapter and project members.

Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] OpenSAMM Talk by Seba Deleersnyder @ OWASP Delhi
 January Meet / 31st Jan (Sat)
Message-ID: <CAAvjMhOVa-6g+XU9nGhLdJ9TQZFWxucOZyVgLgXzkPTtqCC6FQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I am delighted to inform you that we will have *Seba Deleersnyder* deliver
a talk on OWASP OpenSAMM in our upcoming monthly meet on 31st January, 2015.

Seba is the Project Leader of OWASP OpenSAMM.

*Title: OpenSAMM Best Practices: Lessons from the Trenches *

*Time: 03:30 PM IST*

*Abstract:* Managing all application security activities as part of
development and deployment of applications can be an overwhelming
challenge. OWASP OpenSAMM gives you a structural and measurable blueprint
to integrate OWASP best practices in your software life cycle. This OWASP
framework allows you to formulate and implement a strategy for software
security that is tailored to the risk profile of your organisation.
During this talk Sebastien will get you up to speed on the OpenSAMM
framework and share important challenges faced in implementing the
framework within various organisations. Important topics that will be
covered during this presentation are:

   - What is the optimal OpenSAMM maturity level for your organisation?
   - At which level to implement OpenSAMM in the organisation: at company,
   business unit or development team level?
   - How to integrate OpenSAMM activities in agile development?
   - How to apply OpenSAMM on suppliers or outsourced development?
   - What metrics does OpenSAMM provide to manage your secure development
   life cycle?

Practical lessons learned and use cases from the trenches that make OWASP
OpenSAMM a valuable methodology and which you should apply for your secure
development life cycle! Next year we organize the first OpenSAMM summit in
Dublin on 27-28 of March 2015. More details on
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Samm.

*Speaker Bio:* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Sdeleersnyder
*LinkedIn:* linkedin.com/in/sebadele/

Please reach out to the chapter leaders for any queries

Thanks
Sandeep
