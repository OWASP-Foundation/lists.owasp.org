Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Secure Code Review Of PHP application
Message-ID: <0C85D2544295A54EBDB035EA233D2B3F0142B8574618@MBXSRV02.SG.GBS.PRO>

Hello members,

Currently I am looking for some documents on PHP secure code review or freeware secure code analyzer tools for PHP codes. Right now I am using Fortify SCA (I usually Called it 45) for this but I want to revalidate results from some others tools or manually as this is my 1st PHP application for secure code review.

Any suggestions, link or documents which can help me?

Hi Suman,

Our company has developed a source code analysis tool which definitely provides good results for PHP.

I can offer you a free online trial if you would be interested. You would need to be comfortable with uploading your code to our servers in this case.

Alternatively, if you are keen on evaluating the solution but don't want to upload your code, I can have one of our partners visit you for an onsite evaluation.

Please let me know your preference.

Best,

Jordan

Hi Bhasker,

1. Go through the Top 10 vulnerabilities.
2. Apply your learning on WebGoat. It will give you a hand on experience for security testing.
3. You can use proxy like Webscarab / burpsuite to intercept request / response.

Thanks,

Rahul Jain

Message-ID: <1257842912.8501.51.camel@o0o>

Dear OWASP Members,

There is no denying that cyber security has become integral part of
protecting our nation's integrity. This fact can't be highlighted more
than the venerable presence of the most respected technocrat India has
ever produced, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (Former President of India) and Vice
Admiral Shekhar Sinha VSM, NM & BAR, Chief - Integrated Defence Staff,
Ministry of Defence who will grace the upcoming event "Securitybyte &
OWASP AppSec Asia 2009" to be held on 17th - 20th November 2009 at Hotel
Crowne Plaza, Gurgaon, Delhi NCR.

OWASP India is glad to know that our whole and sole mission has reached
the most highest echelons of government. 

You would be glad to know that as of now we have got 300+ confirmed
participation requests. The participation is in amalgamation of the best
and the brightest - civil/government servants, successful entrepreneurs,
InfoSec experts, hackers, other IT professionals and academia. 

We appreciate your enormous support and foresee similar participation
for our future events as well. We have very limited seats available and
even if you intend to register onsite then let us know today to check
the availability.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv Soi

Hi All,
I want basic authentication against ldap to be performed whenever there is a request for 1 particular URL. like www.my-site.com/a.php?a=1. but if the url is anything other than this then is should pass through without invoking basic auth dialouge box. 

please suggest if this can be achieved in Apache HTTP server.
