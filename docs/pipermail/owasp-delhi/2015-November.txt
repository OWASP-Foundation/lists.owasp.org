Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] Call for Volunteers - Flash Talks
Message-ID: <CAAvjMhOq-S9xyJWzzFhvS2PDicJ61RMrCZ1VRX+J2WEjSX8x8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We are looking for speakers to present flash talks in our meets.

What is a Flash talk?
- Flash talks are 15-20 minute lite presentations
- Flash talks can be on wide areas of topics such as a pentest case study,
an OWASP project, a security tool, an open source security project, etc.
- The presentations need not to be expert presentations
- The volunteers can pick up a topic, read about it, collect presentable
materials and present in the meets.

There would be two flash talks every month in our meets (depends on number
of volunteers)

In case you wish to volunteer for speaking please revert to the chapter
leaders (CCed in the mail) with the name of your topic and month you would
be available to present (currently we are looking for speakers for the
month of November and December)

Cheers!

_Sandeep

Hi Team,
Is it possible to get the videos/feeds for the meets we have ?

This way remote people can also take the benefit of the meetings.

Thanks

Great Help !!

Kudos to the Team

Just a thought.. If possible lets start a post-meeting blog/discussion. It

helpful for non-joiners too.

Google groups will be an easy tool to implement for these discussions.
