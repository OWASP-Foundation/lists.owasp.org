Sri,

 

I couldn't agree more.  Your thoughts are spot-on.

 

I'd be more than happy to offer our services in some form or fashion.  Like
OWASP, SCIPP International was founded as a not-for-profit with the sole
purpose of evangelizing security awareness.  Besides a traditional security
awareness course geared towards the end-user we offer an awareness course
targeted at those involved in the SDLC which we branded as SWADA or Secure
Web-Application Development Awareness.

 

Although the current SWADA course has been very well received for the past
18 months or so, we have decided to transform it in to 3 nested courses that
build upon one another (sort like a college, 101, 20x  and 3xx series).
Within the next 45 - 60 days we are planning on phasing in the new courses
and replacing the old one with a &quot;series&quot; of highly targeted awareness
courses.  

 

The lowest level course (approx 1.5 hours) will introduces the participant
to the Principles of Secure Coding (think of it as a 101 type of course) and
is intended for everyone who has anything to do with the SDLC. Even though
the course is an ANSI accredited certificate course, it is not intended to
be a full-fledged training course, but mealy an introduction to terms,
concepts and basic understanding of best business practices.  (We'll have
full outlines of the new courses posted on our web-site within the next week
or two)

 

The Into to Principles of Secure Coding course will be supplemented with a
Managerial track (approx 1.5 - 2 additional hours) which will delve in to
topics such as building security in to the SDLC (requirements gathering and
analysis, system design, development and testing, acceptance, O&amp;M and
disposal) - Software Security Requirements; CLASP; Measuring Progress and
Maturity of the SDLC. Of the 3 courses, this course is probably the most
important as it will lead the learner in to understanding WHY security is so
important to bake in - and not try to add on.  We'll touch on how to get
others to buy-in to the SDLC concept as well.  This is the one that meets
your stated requirements below.

 

After completing the two courses above, Technicians will be ready to be
introduced to some specific vulnerabilities associated with
web-applications.  The 3rd course will be our Technical track (approx an
additional 2 hours) that will cover specific vulnerabilities found in the
likes of the OWASP Top-10 and the CWE/SANS Top-25. Discussions will focus on
each of the vulnerabilities and will help the learner identify if they have
a knowledge gap.  Reference materials will be suggested to assist in
furthering their knowledge as well technical training opportunities.  

 

I think you will agree, the courses outlined above will  really hit home
with anyone who is involved with the SDLC - and would be perfect for firms
who are dependent on business critical applications. I also think you will
agree that everyone should embrace an awareness course such as this.

 

If you are interested, let us know how we can help.

 

Warm regards,

 

Don Cochran

There is a problem with reporting vulnerabilities - every website has
hundreds of them spread all over. Reporting all of them requires a herculean
effort, and without a buy-in from the top management of the website, its not
going to get fixed. Our collective interest will definitely fade if we don't
see some action from the developers.

 

The state our websites our in, we need action from higher management. If
they don't support the initiative, there is just no way that individual
teams/developers will fix hundreds of web pages. I strongly believe we need
to influence the management to take an active interest in application
security.

 

So, instead of vulnerability database, I propose organizing training
sessions for website owners/developers. Perhaps an India wide OWASP meet,
with the stated goal of 'Increasing corporate awareness towards Application
Security'. We can perhaps have a two day seminar, with sessions for business
folks as well as for developers and testers. 

 

Getting sponsors should not be an issue. This also falls well within the
purview of OWASP, so we won't have any legal/political issues. We can use
our individual contacts to make sure most Indian portal owners are aware of
this seminar and have adequate representation. And we can find a lot of
people from this group to help out with the training material, seminars,
presentations and such. 

 

I think that is the best use of the people in this group. Another database
of vulnerabilities is not going to take us too far IMHO.

That sounds like government supportive lang., seems you have had a good time
with them J No offensive though, I like that. 

 

I could better think of collective idea from Subhash's and Sriram's post to
have a central portal dedicated towards web application breaches and flaws
in India, just like WASC (which is for global). The count of vulnerabilities
that WASC could build over 10 years for global websites, I am sure, we can
build similar database for Indian web applications in around 1yr itself J

 

We could think of a model where a vuln. is firstly reported to the owner and
CERT-IN to show our responsibility for the provider. Thereafter, give some
time window to fix the problem. If nothing happens in the window and/or
there is no response from the owner, we show our responsibility for the
consumer and publish it over the portal.

 

We can further brainstorm keeping CERT-IN in loop to drive something
fruitful. Connect me offline if anyone of you is interested to mature this
idea, we can catch up somewhere in NCR, pitch this idea as an OWASP India
Project, participate as volunteers, and do something good for owner,
consumers and govt.

 

Cheers!

I agree with this proposal.  My further suggestions:-

 (a)  Involve CERT-In fully.  This will take care of the legal hassles as it
is their mandate.
 (b)  Follow some thing like responsible disclosure.  Sending vulnerability
information through a central point of contact (preferably at CERT-In).

Subject: RE: [Owasp-delhi] Rediff Astrology

I don't know if it can happen under the ageis of OWASP or not but maybe we
need something like a Jagorey campaign and a &quot;fall of shame&quot;. I'm banking on
this group's collective wisdom to do something...

*	The Jagorey like campaign is for the CxO forums who are often unware
of the problem in their own backyard as the tech manager never notified them
or didn't give them enough gyan (specially to CTO/CISO). Maybe leverage
NASSCOM for such forums (for contact points)
*	The fall of shame is for sites we identity as &quot;bad&quot; weak thru
non-intriusive testing and advise the public about the risks of the weakness
exists even after notification to the company. I understand such a list
opens up more hacks/attacks, and thus we can refrain from displaying the
vulnerable url and details on the attack. CERT-in may be leveraged for this.
I also do not know the complete legal interpretation of such a move (which
may include defamation suits) 

The point I'm trying to make is we know we have issues, with corporate
indfifference to security, with laws that are not enforced well, with
&quot;security people&quot; just doing what I call &quot;khanapoorti&quot; i.e action for the
sake of it. The problems will not go away. As a responsibile community can
we create a task force and collectively do something?. I do understand the
individual efforts like Nilesh's / Sripathi's or Subhash's and others have
fallen on deaf ears and is frustrating....maybe concerted and joint efforts
will bear fruits. 

 

Additional thoughts/comments/feedback...

 

 PS: I use Jagorey like as refernce, as Jagorey campaign is a TV advt
showing a movement against corruption.

Sriram

Old saying and a song - &quot;It happens only in India&quot;. Till the time laws
aren't enforced with a force, no one is bothered about security. Even laws
can be bypassed here, but atleast few would be trapped to set the example
for others.

 

When I explain India InfoSec to the friends abroad, I generally blame the
Indian mindset. Bike Riders here don't care about their personal security
and wear helmets only when there is strict police checking. Same is with the
car drivers for their seat belts. In Delhi, we find better police checking
so people are serious, but in other areas like Noida, no one cares. In a
nutshell, only strict laws can help Corporate India to be secure and deliver
secure.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores
passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what your
password is in case you have forgotten it ;).  When brought to their notice,
I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us, we will get back
to you shortly.  Nobody has got back till date (1 year past).  I think
strong legislative punitive measures are the only solution.

Its not just rediff.com, almost all other Indian portals - in.com,
indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection,
Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless. 

 

I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year,
and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.
