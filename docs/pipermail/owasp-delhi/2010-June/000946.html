<PRE>CERT-In has a charter to send advisories for improving national cyber
security. The organization also monitors attacks on web applications and
networks  including malware attacks.

 

We should write to CERT-In for issuances of necessary guidelines and
enforcing security measures.

 

Best wishes

 

Ashish

I don't know if it can happen under the ageis of OWASP or not but maybe we
need something like a Jagorey campaign and a &quot;fall of shame&quot;. I'm banking on
this group's collective wisdom to do something...

*	The Jagorey like campaign is for the CxO forums who are often unware
of the problem in their own backyard as the tech manager never notified them
or didn't give them enough gyan (specially to CTO/CISO). Maybe leverage
NASSCOM for such forums (for contact points)
*	The fall of shame is for sites we identity as &quot;bad&quot; weak thru
non-intriusive testing and advise the public about the risks of the weakness
exists even after notification to the company. I understand such a list
opens up more hacks/attacks, and thus we can refrain from displaying the
vulnerable url and details on the attack. CERT-in may be leveraged for this.
I also do not know the complete legal interpretation of such a move (which
may include defamation suits) 

The point I'm trying to make is we know we have issues, with corporate
indfifference to security, with laws that are not enforced well, with
&quot;security people&quot; just doing what I call &quot;khanapoorti&quot; i.e action for the
sake of it. The problems will not go away. As a responsibile community can
we create a task force and collectively do something?. I do understand the
individual efforts like Nilesh's / Sripathi's or Subhash's and others have
fallen on deaf ears and is frustrating....maybe concerted and joint efforts
will bear fruits. 

 

Additional thoughts/comments/feedback...

 

 PS: I use Jagorey like as refernce, as Jagorey campaign is a TV advt
showing a movement against corruption.

 

warm regards,

Sriram

Old saying and a song - &quot;It happens only in India&quot;. Till the time laws
aren't enforced with a force, no one is bothered about security. Even laws
can be bypassed here, but atleast few would be trapped to set the example
for others.

 

When I explain India InfoSec to the friends abroad, I generally blame the
Indian mindset. Bike Riders here don't care about their personal security
and wear helmets only when there is strict police checking. Same is with the
car drivers for their seat belts. In Delhi, we find better police checking
so people are serious, but in other areas like Noida, no one cares. In a
nutshell, only strict laws can help Corporate India to be secure and deliver
secure.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores
passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what your
password is in case you have forgotten it ;).  When brought to their notice,
I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us, we will get back
to you shortly.  Nobody has got back till date (1 year past).  I think
strong legislative punitive measures are the only solution.

Its not just rediff.com, almost all other Indian portals - in.com,
indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection,
Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless. 

 

I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year,
and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.
