<PRE>I agree with this proposal. My further suggestions:- 

(a) Involve CERT-In fully. This will take care of the legal hassles as it is their mandate. 
(b) Follow some thing like responsible disclosure. Sending vulnerability information through a central point of contact (preferably at CERT-In).

Subhash Dutta

Subject: RE: [Owasp-delhi] Rediff Astrology 


I don't know if it can happen under the ageis of OWASP or not but maybe we need something like a Jagorey campaign and a &quot;fall of shame&quot;. I'm banking on this group's collective wisdom to do something... 

    &#8226; 
The Jagorey like campaign is for the CxO forums who are often unware of the problem in their own backyard as the tech manager never notified them or didn't give them enough gyan (specially to CTO/CISO). Maybe leverage NASSCOM for such forums (for contact points) 
    &#8226; 
The fall of shame is for sites we identity as &quot;bad&quot; weak thru non-intriusive testing and advise the public about the risks of the weakness exists even after notification to the company. I understand such a list opens up more hacks/attacks, and thus we can refrain from displaying the vulnerable url and details on the attack. CERT-in may be leveraged for this. I also do not know the complete legal interpretation of such a move (which may include defamation suits) 

The point I'm trying to make is we know we have issues, with corporate indfifference to security, with laws that are not enforced well, with &quot;security people&quot; just doing what I call &quot;khanapoorti&quot; i.e action for the sake of it. The problems will not go away. As a responsibile community can we create a task force and collectively do something?. I do understand the individual efforts like Nilesh's / Sripathi's or Subhash's and others have fallen on deaf ears and is frustrating....maybe concerted and joint efforts will bear fruits. 

Additional thoughts/comments/feedback... 

PS: I use Jagorey like as refernce, as Jagorey campaign is a TV advt showing a movement against corruption. 


warm regards, 

Sriram

Old saying and a song &#8211; &#8220;It happens only in India&#8221;. Till the time laws aren&#8217;t enforced with a force, no one is bothered about security. Even laws can be bypassed here, but atleast few would be trapped to set the example for others. 



When I explain India InfoSec to the friends abroad, I generally blame the Indian mindset. Bike Riders here don&#8217;t care about their personal security and wear helmets only when there is strict police checking. Same is with the car drivers for their seat belts. In Delhi, we find better police checking so people are serious, but in other areas like Noida, no one cares. In a nutshell, only strict laws can help Corporate India to be secure and deliver secure.

Yes I have also noted the same. In fact, the imint card company stores passwords as reversible encrypted and will tell you in plain text what your password is in case you have forgotten it ;). When brought to their notice, I received a standard reply - Thanking for contacting us, we will get back to you shortly. Nobody has got back till date (1 year past). I think strong legislative punitive measures are the only solution.

Its not just rediff.com , almost all other Indian portals - in.com , indiatimes.com and sify.com have similar problems. XSS, XSRF, SQL Injection, Poor password/session management, open redirects .. the list is endless. 





I have written to each of the above portals several times in the past year, and have given up. IMHO, they are not interested in securing their websites.
