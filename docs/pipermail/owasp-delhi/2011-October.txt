Hi John,

I am not sure, if I mistakenly entered wrong data in the online event
planner, there might be some misinterpretation while reading the titles.
However, everything in details is inserted in the budget tool, request you
to kindly review the same. Total anticipated attendance in the conference is
nearly 400. We had 550 last year, but I am going little conservative there.
For the training tracks, last time we had 221 participants, this year again
my conservative approach has allowed me to put down a total figure of 180.
My luck never betrays though :-) so it could be beyond the figures we
achieved last year, but I am trying to talk little practical on the figures.

Hi Mark,

There can be 4 global conference in a calendar year. Any reason to make it
regional? Attendance of 500 at conference with 200 at trainings, well
justifies to mark it global. Seek your suggestions here. I have responded to
your rest of the comments in the OCMS.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] OWASP India Conference in 2012
Message-ID: <CA+Rr0=6TJmSq4qLgHXjGFMopi7rtgG=N+diDL8DmBSACyyRN7w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP Delhi Members,

I was thinking to give out a surprise to the OWASP community on our upcoming
conference in India (Delhi). But may be it was not meant to be a surprise,
instead of selecting other OWASP address, mistakenly I selected OWASP delhi
list and my previous mail on the list has already disclosed the planning.
Anyways, that demonstrates a good reason to use DLP solutions in the
corporate where the information gets leaked unintentionally, by selecting
the wrong email address :-) Doesn't matter in the open community where
everything is open!

Yes, so finally I am planning the upcoming conference in the month of May,
tentative dates are 17th and 18th May 2012. Right now, I am getting the
things approved from the OWASP Board in the US. Soon, we should be out with
the agenda.

We have planned the agenda as per the feedback we have received from the
last 2 conferences, it would be 1 day conference, since 2 days looked bore
to many. Training of 2 days ate away lot of your time, so we have planned
multiple tracks of half days, much like what we did in 2008. Feel free to
write me offline if you wish to see some modifications.

Get yourself ready for the next InfoSec blast.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Dhruv,

Your correct, there is only one Global AppSec per geographic region each
year.  Next year we have
Global AppSec AsiaPac 2012 - March 12, 2012 - March 16, 2012 - Sydney,
Australia
Global AppSec Research 2012 - July 10, 2012 - July 13, 2012 - Athens, Greece
Global AppSec North America 2012 - Oct. 22, 2012 - Oct. 26, 2012 - Austin,
TX
Global AppSec Latin America 2012 - Nov. 14, 2012 - Nov. 16, 2012 - Buenos
Aires, Argentina

The event size is not a determining factor in if it's a global appsec or
not, although your welcome to keep the appsec name.  As an example the
conference I run, AppSec DC was a Global AppSec in 09 but last year and next
year it is classified as a regional event.
