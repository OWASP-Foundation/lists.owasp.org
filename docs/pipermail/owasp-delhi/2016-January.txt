Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] CCFP - Project Help Required
Message-ID: <37B9B98C7D988346A7BB1298129B24C81E4814D43F@IGTCOLOEXMBX.interglobetechnologies.com>

Hi All,

I have cleared the Certified Computer Forensic Professional (CCFP from NIELIT) examination and as per guidelines need to do an Industrial Project for the same in Computer Forensic fields. I need support in terms of identification of guide / mentor in the field of ?Computer Forensic?. You all are requested to please connect me with the person who can help me in the same.

Below is the requirement for the same -
 The Project is identified by the student under guidance and support of faculty, management of the respective institute and through Industrial Interaction with the Industry in which student would undergo the project. The Project work should be of nature of Product/system design and development. The problem may be selected from an industry/institution. The project has to be done individually and no grouping is allowed. There is only one project to be submitted.

Objective of the Project -  The aim of the project is to give the students an integrated experience in solving a real life problem by applying knowledge and skills gained on completion of theory papers up to level3. It provides an occasion for students to realize the importance of resource and time management, ownership of task towards deliverables, innovation and efficiency in task management. It also provides a good opportunity for students to build, enhance and sustain high levels of professional conduct and performance and evolves a problem solver frame of mind in student. It is also felt that taking up the project by a student prepares him for a job in industry and elsewhere.

Who could be a Supervisor/Guide: .Regarding guide from the Industry the Qualification for the guide could be B. Tech with five year of adequate experience in the area in which the student has chosen the project.


Looking forward for your support.


Regards,

Naveen Grover, CISSA
