you provide the better it is for the reviewers. Please keep the abstract to
the point. Please do not try to hide the technical details or say &quot;I can't
disclose it till bla bla&quot; as it does not help the reviewers in any way and
may give your paper a low score because of insufficient information
available in the abstract.

Note
====
  - Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected.
  - The Abstract should clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail
and merely mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the
research to its full extent.
  - Be as descriptive as possible in the abstract.
  - Attach your source code/exploit/full paper along with the submission
  - nullcon is an open knowledge/research sharing platform and hence
product/company marketing and pitches will be rejected. We request you not
