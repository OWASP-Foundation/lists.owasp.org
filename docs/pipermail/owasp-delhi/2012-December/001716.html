<PRE>Though most of it is available within OWASP Testing Framework however not in the way you possibly need it. Our company follows simple and straight forward approach driven from OWASP guidelines which you might like to consider

 

                                                                                                                                Application SOA (Website, Web Application, Intranet, Mobile, Web 2.0, Flash, Thick Client etc.)

                                                                                                                                                                                                | (Controls Mapping)

Security Principles (CIA) &#224; Testing Modules (Authentication, Authorization, etc. etc.) &#224; Controls/Checks

                                                                                                                                                                                                | (Controls Mapping)

                                                                                                                                Application SOA (Views, Controllers, Models, Transport, In-Memory/Storage, etc.)

 

You can have more definitions for such mappings with further security testing objectives in mind. There is certainly a possibility to make it more sophisticated and robust, but I follow this approach for being simple to adopt hence easy to enforce, allows segregation of duties while testing large apps hence ease of monitoring and accountability for testers. This could be starting point: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Secure_Web_Application_Framework_Manifesto/Releases/Current/Manifesto">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Secure_Web_Application_Framework_Manifesto/Releases/Current/Manifesto</A> 

 

You can also think of including simple framework to map each application security finding to financials (loss[fixing, not-fixing]) into the existing framework, since $$$ works better than c:\windows\system32 for senior management

 

Some details are available here: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Security_Guide_For_CISOs#Considering_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Application_Security_Measures_Before_Making_Investments">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Security_Guide_For_CISOs#Considering_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Application_Security_Measures_Before_Making_Investments</A>

 

Many Thanks,

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Security framework for different layers of web application

 

Hi All,

                We are in the process of arriving at the Security best practices or Security framework containing view per paradigm (Web, intranet, extranet) for the different areas of Web Application i.e. UI layer, Database layer, Business layer, Services layer, Transport across layers . The different categories that are targeted in Security framework are Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability, Non-repudiation .

 

                There are a lot of material available for Secure SDLC practices but little on the above topic. Any pointers will be of great help. Thanks in advance!

 

Kind Regards,

Archana
