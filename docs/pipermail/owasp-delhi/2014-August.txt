Try going through Gartner's Magic quadrant for 2014 for Application
Security Testing. There are some good market leaders and challengers.

Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] [Project] OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls
Message-ID: <CAN9ux9ydah8O_b46U3zAY1Wi_pgjLv2d+g9vTOuV8Vp7yg-42w@mail.gmail.com>

Fellow OWASPians,

Came to know about this project recently -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab=Main

Excerpt from the project description seems to hit the nail on its head:

   - Most developers did not learn about secure coding or crypto in school.
   - The languages and frameworks that developers use to build web
   applications are often lacking critical core controls or are insecure by
   default in some way.
   - It is also very rare when organizations provide developers with
   prescriptive requirements that guide them down the path of secure software.
   And even when they do, there may be security flaws inherent in the
   requirements and designs.

Check it out!

Hi Priyanka,

Before selecting any tool, you should consider following points:
1. How critical is your website: If the website is not so much business
critical, you certainly dont want to spend too much money to buy too
many/too expensive tools for it.
2. What type of data you are trying to secure: If you are handling very
critical data, you would not just stop at one type of tool or one type of
scanning.
3. What is your budget: This is the primary constrain on selecting any
tool. If you have very less budget, instead of buying tool, you can take
service of any security auditing firm and save lots of money. Plus you are
also delegating some of the risk of assessing by own.
4.How often you would audit your website: Same as above. Plus, There are
services as well as licensing models from market leader vendors that you
might want to consider.
5. What is the in-house capability you have to audit the site: Ultimately
it comes back to how much you understand the security, how good you are
with security tools, how much time you can invest on understanding the rule
pack, how good you are with coding (for code review) any other such things.

After considering above points, if you are still willing to invest in tools
which you want to install in your premises you can consider following tools
(I have done evaluation of most of the tools and also worked with them):
Secure Core review /Static code review:
1. HP Fortify: Good tool, covers most of the technologies and also have
mobile app scanning capability. Very expensive.
2. Checkmarx: easy to use. Good scanning tool. Does not scan mobile apps.
Technology coverage is less.
3: IBM App Scan Source: just kidding. its not worth for money :)

Dynamic Scanner/ VA:
1. Acunetix: Good tool (never worked on it but got good feedback)
2. HP Webinspect: Good tool. Little bit expensive.
3. IBM AppScan Standard: Good tool. less expensive. Bulky to install.
4. Cenzic Hailstorm: Over all a good tool. but you will have issue if your
application have flash components or client certificate based
authentication. But it if you get the very good deal from them.

Gopal Gupta

Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] DOM-based XSS risk rating

Hi Padma,

Good question. The original discussion thread is still ongoing.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting has a good
write-up of the different XSS types. Someone shared that as well.

In my opinion:

1) DOM-based XSS would top the risk list -  Attack payload is difficult to
detect effectively and fix strongly as it manifests/lives in the DOM
environment (on the client-side).
2) Stored XSS (persistent impact) would be next - Persistent impact but
possible to detect attack payload server side and fix strongly by means of
well-known encoding filters.
3) Reflected XSS -  Non-persistent impact and possible to detect attack
payload server side followed by fixing strongly by means of well-known
encoding filters.

There might be specific scenarios where the rating might change but those
would be exceptions and not the norm.

Vishal

Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] nullcon CFP is open
Message-ID: <CABZSstzFN6Q2bP3VhU6K05zKkm760OnU3Th1zvrf4UkEYj-Wpg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Security Gurus,

6th year | CFP opens on 6th Aug 2014 | conference on 6th Feb 2015.

Welcome to nullcon 666! Bring out the beast in you.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/666_(number)

we are happy to open the CFP. Time to tickle your gray cells and submit
your research.
Training: 4th-5th Feb 2015
Conference: 6th-7th Feb 2015

CFP 666
=======
Website - http://nullcon.net

Submit under any of the below options
Papers (40 mins - 1 hr)
Events (Sub-events, Competitions, CTF, BOFs)
Recreation (Fun events, Games, Parties, Tech Rock bands, Djs)
Tutorials (2-3hrs Workshops, hacking villages)


Submission Topics
==============
- Anything that aligns with our motto - "The neXt security thing!" is
welcome.
- And as a special consideration for 666 anything beastly devilish is also
welcome.

Categories
========
The talk time duration includes time for questions and answers (5-10
minutes)

  - New Research Category (40 mins - 1 hr) - is a deep knowledge technical
track that includes new research, tools, vulnerabilities, zero days or
exploits.

  - Desi Jugaad (30 mins - 1 hr) - is our signature new research category
talk and includes any local hacks. This category is dedicated to hackers
who find innovative tech/non-tech solutions for real-life challenges.

  - Current Research Category (30 mins - 1 hr) - comprises of known
security issues, case studies, twist to an existing research, tool,
vulnerability, exploit or research-in-progress. Although this track is
fairly technical, it covers known techniques, analysis and research already
published or presented even though there might be some additions to it.

  - Tool Category (30 mins - 1 hr) - Comprises of open source security
tools, exploits, frameworks etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their software to the world.


Submission Format
===============
Email the paper to: cfp at nullcon.net
The subject should be: CFP Goa 2015 < Paper Title >

Email Body:
    1. Name
    2. Handle
    3. Talk Category
       (Mentioned above i.e.
         - For talks - new research/current research/desi Jugaad/tool.
         - For other things - Event/Recreation/Tutorials)
    4. Time required (including 5-10 mins of QA)
    5. Paper Title
    6. Country (and City) of residence
    7. Organization and Designation
    8. Contact Number
    9. Have you presented or submitted this paper at any other
conference(s) or magazine(s)?
    Yes, No. If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the
previous ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or are
due to be given elsewhere prior to nullcon will be considered as current
research category talks unless they consist of cutting edge and ground
breaking technology, which is at the judgment of the review committee.

    10. Are you releasing an open source tool?
    Yes/No. (If yes, please include the source code for review)

    11. Are you releasing an exploit?
    Yes/No. (If yes, please include the source and vulnerability details
for review)

    12. Are you releasing a new vulnerability/Zero-day?
    Yes/No. (If yes, please send us the details, including reproduction
procedure, for review)

    13. Why do you think your paper is different/innovative (for all
categories) and how does it qualify as new work/research(for Research
category only)?

    14. Are there any live demonstrations (These earn you good points
during review)?
    Yes/No. (If Yes, how many? Also please explain each demo)

    15. Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

    16. Paper Abstract
    Please provide detailed working or your research/work. The more details
you provide the better it is for the reviewers. Please keep the abstract to
the point. Please do not try to hide the technical details or say "I can't
disclose it till bla bla" as it does not help the reviewers in any way and
may give your paper a low score because of insufficient information
available in the abstract.

    17. Your high resolution photo (attached)

Note
====
  - Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected.
  - The Abstract should clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail
and merely mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the
research to its full extent.
  - Be as descriptive as possible in the abstract.
  - Attach your source code/exploit/full paper along with the submission
  - nullcon is an open knowledge/research sharing platform and hence
product/company marketing and pitches will be rejected. We request you not
to submit any product specific talk.

Hi Tantuj,

Chapter meets are free for everyone.Details about upcoming and past meets
are available on the chapter wiki page here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Delhi_NCR.Notifications will also be shared
on this mailing list and social media but, these will essentially direct
the users back to the wiki page. In short, the page will continue to remain
the central source of information.

OWASP India Conference is an annual event that's managed by a different
entity/chapter known as OWASP India. Get in touch with Dhruv (
dhruv.soi at owasp.org) and Nitin (nitin.saxena at owasp.org) for
schedule/registration etc.

Dear Vishal

There is nothing on the link you provided.

I am sorry to say that OWASP Delhi chapter is non-operational, It only get
activated when there is a conference. There are no regular meetings.

Around 5-6 Years back we used to have meetings mainly in various companies
in Noida and around. Since OWASP Delhi starting conference execution,
conduction of these meetings and free training programme is over.

It will be great if these trainings are started again.

If any one want to correct me that can inform about the trainings conducted
in last one year other then conferences.

regards

Sushil Kumar Nehra

Hi Sushil,

Delhi chapter's first revival meet was held on July 26th, 2014 at Adobe's
Noida campus. We had 40+ attendees.
Details were posted on the wiki page. Matter-of-fact, we even blogged about
it. Url is very much on the wiki page. Look in the 'Past Events' tab.

Looks like default formatting of the mailing list software appended extra
content to the Chapter wiki url shared in my previous mail. Please check
here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Delhi_NCR

See you in August meet! Monitor the 'Upcoming Events/Meet' tab.
