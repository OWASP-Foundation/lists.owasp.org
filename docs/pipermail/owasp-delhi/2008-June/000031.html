<PRE>Definitely one of the culprits here but would like to mention that this
Chapter definitely needs more participation from members to create real
value out of this platform. 
anyone listening? :-)
 
BTW, Druv, great job organising the event - also found a mention of it
on Jeremiah's blog -

Unfortunately, I wont be able to attend in person - any plans to record
the proceedings? would be realy helpful - thanks

	Welcome Gunwant to the Delhi Chapter mailing list. We will try
our level best to avail you with the best resources and accurate
information towards your AppSec related queries. Coming on to your
queries, we have not yet made any announcement for upcoming chapter
meetings coz right now our focus is to bring the biggest application
security (OWASP) conference in India. 

	 

	This mailing list indeed is a platform to share knowledge and
post queries. So go ahead and shoot the one!!

	 

	Many Thanks,

	Dhruv

	Hi All,

	 

	Let me introduce myself to all the members of the OWASP Delhi
Chapter. I am Gunwant Singh, working in Noida (NCR) as a security
consultant.

	I have been attached with application security and OWASP for
quite a while although I registered to this particular chapter recently.
It gives me immense pleasure to be a part of OWASP and I am sure we will
take this chapter to new heights.

	 

	I have a few concerns if someone is willing to answer. Is there
any timely meeting of the members of this chapter, if yes then can I
have the details. 

	Moreover, is this mailing list also meant to be as a platform to
share knowledge and/or ask questions for bolstering one's knowledge?

	 

	Thank you all.

	 

	Regards.

	Gunwant Singh
