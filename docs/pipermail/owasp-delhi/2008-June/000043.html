<PRE>Greetings Gunwant,

 

Good to see you back in action!! As you have already got few good responses
against your query, so I won't reiterate the known theory here. But I would
certainly like to participate in this thread. 

 

How would you know that you are running out of exploits? Do you see, there
have been numerous vulnerabilities published on the internet/non-disclosure
channels or transferred via IRC/contacts/pre-published advisories to your
knowledge these days, at fast pace than expected? If you rely on published
vulnerabilities, and if administrators have fixed those vulnerabilities by
applying the patches then you have no option but to wait for administrators
to commit yet another mistake (I am sure, they do care for security
auditors/attackers to have some fun with the company resources :-) ). Even
if not, you would still find numbers of servers on the wild available,
un-patched for MS03/04/05-00X vulnerability and tons of IIS/Apache servers
those are vulnerable to old time attacks. Don't be surprised if I say that
during a recent pen-test assignment, we found MS02-018 vulnerability in a
live web server for some reputed and well known company (obviously, can't
disclose the name of client to avoid making you jump out of your chair).
Seems to be funny, ain't it? But, welcome to India!!! Lot of effort is still
required to make the community know the risk of hosting vulnerable resources
to wild wild web (www). There are still lots of reputed websites those are
running with information disclosure vulnerability (no exploit needed, hah!),
where the available information is worth few bucks, if not million
dollars!!! I don't run/promote any shop in a Nehru Place though :-)

 

Network based attacks could vary due to variety of architectures available
today, so gathering good amount of standalone exploits for every
architecture would be a tough job and hence, we can rely on known tools like
metasploit/coreimpact those have almost all (If not all, then many) variants
of known exploit codes with options to inject shell codes of your choice.
Along with this, there are others web resources to standalone exploits and
those have already been mentioned in earlier replies to your query, there
could ofcourse be lot more those you could hit at. I used to maintain a list
of exploit links when I used to work as a security researcher, but I have
not used these links from ages (may be from past 4yrs) so am not sure how
many of those links still work, so excuse me if none of those work for you.
But anyhow, I have pasted those links next to my signatures. 

 

For application based exploits, it is already been said that cheat sheets +
fuzzer works far better than relying on collection of exploit codes. Refer
to old HD Moore's style of writing a small fuzzer, where he could find more
than 50 flaws in Internet Explorer :-) (I love Microsoft for increasing
employment for malware/security researchers/attackers.) Application based
attacks are mostly driven due to functional + technical faults, and can
mostly be observed by humans rather than automated exploit framework/tools.
Finding variants for application based attacks is far easier coz all
programmers can't think alike and can't think of delivering secure code
every time coz their companies teach them for delivering functional code,
both for clients and attackers :-)

 

Hope helps!

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Reg. exploits.

 

Hi all,

 

I am back again with a question. Thank you for your support so far.

While testing, I have come to know that I am running out of exploits. Since
administrators are coming up with latest patches to cover up the existing
vulnerabilities, one must also update his/her exploit collection w.r.t the
vulnerabilities found. I have a collection of some exploits which are mostly
for web servers (IIS, Apache, etc.). Just wanted to know, what resources you
guys use to get the exploits, or you build your own. I m looking for both
network based and application based exploits. May be if someone wants to
share some exploits or links for any resources. Any feedback will be highly
appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Gunwant Singh
