<PRE>Thanks Jitesh and absolutely right said!! We invited Jeremiah for this event
and he was very keen to come down but unfortunately, he couldn't make it
this time. Otherwise, we would have also got a chance to meet the blog owner
:<i>-)
</I>
 

Conference recordings will be available at the will of the speaker to
redistribute. But recording the training session might bring obligation on
OWASP to ensure that recordings are not redistributed b'coz training
material will include proprietary documents/research data of the trainer.
So, we will refrain ourselves from getting the training sessions recorded.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Definitely one of the culprits here but would like to mention that this
Chapter definitely needs more participation from members to create real
value out of this platform. 

anyone listening? :-)

 

BTW, Druv, great job organising the event - also found a mention of it on
Jeremiah's blog -
<A HREF="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2008/06/appsec-conference-goes-to-india">http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2008/06/appsec-conference-goes-to-india</A>
.html

 

Unfortunately, I wont be able to attend in person - any plans to record the
proceedings? would be realy helpful - thanks

Welcome Gunwant to the Delhi Chapter mailing list. We will try our level
best to avail you with the best resources and accurate information towards
your AppSec related queries. Coming on to your queries, we have not yet made
any announcement for upcoming chapter meetings coz right now our focus is to
bring the biggest application security (OWASP) conference in India. 

 

This mailing list indeed is a platform to share knowledge and post queries.
So go ahead and shoot the one!!

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Introduction to OWASP Delhi members

 

Hi All,

 

Let me introduce myself to all the members of the OWASP Delhi Chapter. I am
Gunwant Singh, working in Noida (NCR) as a security consultant.

I have been attached with application security and OWASP for quite a while
although I registered to this particular chapter recently. It gives me
immense pleasure to be a part of OWASP and I am sure we will take this
chapter to new heights.

 

I have a few concerns if someone is willing to answer. Is there any timely
meeting of the members of this chapter, if yes then can I have the details. 

Moreover, is this mailing list also meant to be as a platform to share
knowledge and/or ask questions for bolstering one's knowledge?

 

Thank you all.

 

Regards.

Gunwant Singh
