Hi,

I think following link will give a clear picture on what we were looking for.

CNET interviewed Nohl via e-mail on Thursday about his latest work and what the implications are for the more than 3 billion GSM mobile phones worldwide,

Am sure when the algo was devised it was known mathematically that a break would exist.

The issue goes beyond technology; since commercially there are millions of phones with pre programmed chips and micro controllers perhaps that won't be compatible with any new algo. I think that's the main reason why that algo still exists and with continue to exist for a while. So the change may take a while to phase in.

Also, given what you know how many can exploit it? Infact the more interesting logical question is "how do u exploit it?"

Hi,

I hope group members would like to know the State of Data Security and Privacy in the Indian Industry. On page no 33, you'll get the survey results on "PROMINENT TRENDS IN APPLICATION SECURITY INITIATIVES".

Data Security Council of India has released the report of the recently conducted Survey on Data Security and Privacy. The survey was conducted by DSCI through KPMG, in association with CERT-In, under the Cyber Security Awareness Project sponsored by DIT, MCIT, Govt. of India. The survey covered 153 leading companies from sectors including Banking & Financial Services, Manufacturing, E-Commerce, IT & ITES, Telecom, and PSUs.


The objective of Data Security survey was to:



1.      Assess the importance given to information security and data privacy

2.      Capture the leading practices and/or standards adopted for Information Security and Data Privacy in organizations

3.      Identify the major sources of data leakage, compromising of data privacy, in organizations

4.      Study the status of Information and Physical Security Convergence.

5.      Awareness about the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008, and interface with Cert-In when incidents happen



You can view or download the survey report from the following link: http://www.dsci.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=95.

Suman

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Proxy servers
Message-ID: <455130.39885.qm@web53105.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello Everyone,

Happy New Year 2010!

Does anyone know how one can identify free proxy servers (HTTP/HTTPS) located in other countries. I'm particularly looking for the following countries:

Cuba, Syria, Sudan, Iran and North Korea (Fat chance, but still...). 

I've already tried Googling for these and found sites like aliveproxy.com and proxyswitcher.com. While the former site lists the proxies from Sudan, Iran and Syria, these proxies are inactive and therefore, inaccessible. The latter site provides a tool that facilitates an anonymity network, but this tool does not list any proxy from the countries i mentioned above (except Iran).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!
Harish

Subject: [WEB SECURITY] WASC Announcement: WASC Threat Classification v2.0
Published

 

The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) is pleased to announce the
long awaited release of the WASC 

Threat Classification v2.0. The Threat Classification is an effort to
classify the weaknesses, and attacks 

that can lead to the compromise of a website, its data, or its users. This
document's primarily purpose is 

to serve as a reference guide for common attacks and weaknesses.

 

Main goals

- Refine document scope, terminology, and purpose

- Update existing sections when applicable

- Add missing attacks and weaknesses

- Creation of a firm, scalable base foundation allowing for the introduction
of data views allowing for various 

  forms of data representation

- Addition of attack and weakness reference identifiers (WASC-<xx>)

- Publication of two data views

A security researcher has uncovered vulnerabilities in Twitter and Google
Calendar that could put users at risk.

In a proof of concept, researcher Nir Goldshlager demonstrated cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Google Calendar and Twitter that he said
could be used to steal cookies and session IDs. He also uncovered an HTML
injection issue affecting Google Calendar as well that he said could be used
to redirect a victim to an attack site any time the user viewed his or her
Google Calendar agenda events.

Hello Everyone,

 

Happy New Year 2010!

 

Does anyone know how one can identify free proxy servers (HTTP/HTTPS) located in other countries. I'm particularly looking for the following countries:

 

Cuba, Syria, Sudan, Iran and North Korea (Fat chance, but still...). 

 

I've already tried Googling for these and found sites like aliveproxy.com and proxyswitcher.com. While the former site lists the proxies from Sudan, Iran and Syria, these proxies are inactive and therefore, inaccessible. The latter site provides a tool that facilitates an anonymity network, but this tool does not list any proxy from the countries i mentioned above (except Iran).

 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks in advance!

Harish

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] More attackers targeting Social Networking and
	software vendors sites
Message-ID: <4b4463a1.0504c00a.7e24.1df0@mx.google.com>

There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months.
Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days that helps
malware hop from one machine to another with its payload which most of the
times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites like Twitter and
Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to carry targeted attacks.
Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010 Threat prediction:
http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_pred
ict_1209_v2.pdf 

 

Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability and
detailed report has been published here:
http://torridnetworks.com/index.php/case-studies/50-information-security/139
-malware-analysis-report-for-a-targeted-attack-via-word-document-carried-out
-against-few-sensitive-email-accounts-belonging-to-elite-customer-of-torrid.
html 

 

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all their
employees while using social networking portals which I think makes lot of
sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there something similar
happening at your organization as well? 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Good Evenining all

A very Happy New Year to all the OWASP delhi members.

I am a B.Tech student of 6th sem (3rd year) in Computer Science stream. i
have to opt for 2 months internship after my 6th sem i.e in coming
June-July. I am keenly interested in having my intership in Web application
security or Network security. I have a fair knowledge about web app
security(SQL,XSS,Session handling etc),reverse engineering,basic networking
and have practised my skills to some extent on HACKMEs, CRACKMEs, WEBGOAT
etc.

Can anyone please suggest me some of the companies i can apply to for my
interships in WebApp/Network Security field.

Any suggestions regarding the issue are highly appreciated.

Thanks in anticipation

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Proxy servers
Message-ID: <d954cdd31001051430n2ae0b79ci56d983ecf0c301ae@mail.gmail.com>

There are tons of new free anonymous proxy servers coming from
different parts of the world every day. You can find these on specific
proxy list sites, google it or join the anonymous proxy mailing lists
which mail you the latest proxies on a regular basis.

It is no wonder if many of the existing proxy sites become inactive
over a period of time.

Hope you would agree that Irrespective of the country of origin, most
of these proxy servers come with their own risk set & hence their
usage should be avoided.

While the former site lists the proxies from Sudan, Iran and Syria, these proxies are inactive and therefore, inaccessible.

Hi Dhruv, 

 

Thanks for sharing this, great analysis

There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months.
Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days
that helps malware hop from one machine to another with its payload
which most of the times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites
like Twitter and Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to
carry targeted attacks. Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010
Threat prediction:
http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_
predict_1209_v2.pdf 

 

Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability
and detailed report has been published here:

/139-malware-analysis-report-for-a-targeted-attack-via-word-document-car
ried-out-against-few-sensitive-email-accounts-belonging-to-elite-custome
r-of-torrid.html 

 

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all
their employees while using social networking portals which I think
makes lot of sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there
something similar happening at your organization as well? 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Such issues can be deal by awareness program including other preventive steps. I guess many companies; especially large employee base has already circulated the policy regarding this.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] More attackers targeting Social Networking and software vendors sites

There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months. Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in Microsoft Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days that helps malware hop from one machine to another with its payload which most of the times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites like Twitter and Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to carry targeted attacks. Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010 Threat prediction: http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_predict_1209_v2.pdf

Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability and detailed report has been published here: http://torridnetworks.com/index.php/case-studies/50-information-security/139-malware-analysis-report-for-a-targeted-attack-via-word-document-carried-out-against-few-sensitive-email-accounts-belonging-to-elite-customer-of-torrid.html

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all their employees while using social networking portals which I think makes lot of sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there something similar happening at your organization as well?

Many Thanks,

Dear Vaibhav,

I really appreciate your efforts and learning approach, Keep it up!!!

Regarding WebApp/Network Security companies, You can take reference from Cert-In ( http://www.cert-in.org.in/security-auditors.htm) and some googling will help you in making complete database. You can use database for your current purpose. I wish I could tell you some specific companies name but I don't have any idea how many companies are currently offering internship programs on App/Net security (I heard only paid training programs on appsec and netsec so far).

Let's wait, if any other group member has any idea on this.

All the best!!!

Regards
Suman

Hi,

Adobe's implementation of Javascript in PDF documents, referred to as Acrobat JavaScript<http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/Acro6JSGuide.pdf>, appears to have been originally introduced based on the popularity of PDF eForms. Javascript allows for some dynamic behaviors in PDF's, including calculations, responses to user actions, user data validation, and the integration of other dynamic capabilities.

That said, for many users PDF's are simply a mechanism for providing documents to read. Given the spate of vulnerabilities identified in Acrobat and Reader in 2009, and the likely promise of more in 2010, an advisable approach, depending on your usage of these products, may be to disable Javascript and only re-enable when performing an activity with a PDF that requires Javascript be enabled, such as with an eForm.

Adobe notes that disabling Javascript mitigates against exploits identified this year that use Javascript functions to cause a memory corruption, although in some cases it would be possible to create variants that do not rely on Javascript. To disable Javascript in Adobe Reader or Acrobat: select Edit > Preferences, select the JavaScript option on the left, and uncheck the Enable Acrobat JavaScript option

Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability and detailed report has been published here: http://torridnetworks.com/index.php/case-studies/50-information-security/139-malware-analysis-report-for-a-targeted-attack-via-word-document-carried-out-against-few-sensitive-email-accounts-belonging-to-elite-customer-of-torrid.html

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all their employees while using social networking portals which I think makes lot of sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there something similar happening at your organization as well?

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

 using dedicated computers for online banking

ADVISE : SME Must Do Online Banking from Dedicated Computers
US FBI and the American Bankers Association recommend using dedicated computers for online banking
By Lucian Constantin, Web News Editor
4 January 2010
http://news.softpedia.com/news/Small-Businesses-Should-Conduct-Online-Banking-from-Dedicated-Computers-131086.shtml
Following a flurry of incidents where hundreds of thousands of dollars have been siphoned from the bank accounts of small businesses and public institutions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the American Bankers Association (ABA) advise using dedicated computers for online banking operations. This unusual security model should severely limit the exposure to malware threats for the PCs in question.
The level of Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers fraud rose significantly during last year prompting serious concerns from the authorities. These fraudulent schemes are complex and usually leave little evidence behind to help investigators or the victims looking to recover their losses.
Such attacks usually start with a computer trojan infecting a computer used for online banking at an institution. Thousands of different versions of these trojans are released every month in order to bypass the detection mechanisms of antivirus software.
Once on the computer, the malware watches for browsing sessions to known online banking websites and information such as authentication credentials or account balance is captured. Subsequently, the attackers direct the trojan to initiate batches of fraudulent transfers to bank accounts belonging to various U.S. residents that have been tricked to work for them.
The latter are known as "money mules" and are usually recruited by fake foreign companies under the promise of a profitable work-from-home job. Their task is to receive money allegedly coming from customers of the company and wire them out of the country, while keeping a commission for themselves.
Unfortunately for companies, they are not protected by the same laws as general consumers. While banks will reimburse the losses caused by fraud when personal accounts are involved, they are not required to do so for business accounts. They can recall transfers as long as the money has not been withdrawn and wired, but if the later happens, it is almost certainly lost.
USA Today reports that the feds' recommendation regarding the use of a dedicated PC for online tasks is based on reducing possible infection vectors, since apparently browsing to unrelated websites or checking email from it should be banned. The companies are also advised to request receiving out of bank payment confirmation.
We'll go even further and suggest that the dedicated computer use Linux, FreeBSD, or even Mac OS X, if that suits you better. We're not trying to start a controversy over which operating system is better or more secure. In fact, this has nothing to do with the security of the operating system itself, but the fact that 99.9% of these trojans were constructed for Windows and will fail to run on anything else.
The easiest approach is downloading a Linux live CD, booting from it, performing the online banking tasks, then removing it and restarting back into Windows. Need to open an excel spreadsheet, browse, check email or access a network storage? The Ubuntu Linux live CD will allow you to run Firefox, OpenOffice and perform most of the basic tasks without installing anything on the local disk.

Suman

I agree with Chintan.

Posting links related to major attacks are OK but turning out mailing list
into 'News Board' is not a good idea.....  ;)

It is also advised that Major threats and Corrective actions as  observed 
shall be shared quickly for incidents faced by the Organizations.

But discussion sharing on code threats and details may be informative for 
action by some, therefore it can be planned for circulation on monthly

Even on monthly basis the hyperlinks with the subject /item topic may be

Else we are already receiving Emails from OWASP, either with thanks , good

I agree with Chintan.

Posting links related to major attacks are OK but turning out mailing list 
into 'News Board' is not a good idea.....  ;)

ADVISE : SME Must Do Online Banking from Dedicated Computers
US FBI and the American Bankers Association recommend using dedicated 
computers for online banking 
By Lucian Constantin, Web News Editor
4 January 2010
http://news.softpedia.com/news/Small-Businesses-Should-Conduct-Online-Banking-from-Dedicated-Computers-131086.shtml
Following a flurry of incidents where hundreds of thousands of dollars 
have been siphoned from the bank accounts of small businesses and public 
institutions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the American 
Bankers Association (ABA) advise using dedicated computers for online 
banking operations. This unusual security model should severely limit the 
exposure to malware threats for the PCs in question.
The level of Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers fraud rose 
significantly during last year prompting serious concerns from the 
authorities. These fraudulent schemes are complex and usually leave little 
evidence behind to help investigators or the victims looking to recover 
their losses.
Such attacks usually start with a computer trojan infecting a computer 
used for online banking at an institution. Thousands of different versions 
of these trojans are released every month in order to bypass the detection 
mechanisms of antivirus software.
Once on the computer, the malware watches for browsing sessions to known 
online banking websites and information such as authentication credentials 
or account balance is captured. Subsequently, the attackers direct the 
trojan to initiate batches of fraudulent transfers to bank accounts 
belonging to various U.S. residents that have been tricked to work for 
them.
The latter are known as "money mules" and are usually recruited by fake 
foreign companies under the promise of a profitable work-from-home job. 
Their task is to receive money allegedly coming from customers of the 
company and wire them out of the country, while keeping a commission for 
themselves.
Unfortunately for companies, they are not protected by the same laws as 
general consumers. While banks will reimburse the losses caused by fraud 
when personal accounts are involved, they are not required to do so for 
business accounts. They can recall transfers as long as the money has not 
been withdrawn and wired, but if the later happens, it is almost certainly 
lost.
USA Today reports that the feds' recommendation regarding the use of a 
dedicated PC for online tasks is based on reducing possible infection 
vectors, since apparently browsing to unrelated websites or checking email 
from it should be banned. The companies are also advised to request 
receiving out of bank payment confirmation.
We'll go even further and suggest that the dedicated computer use Linux, 
FreeBSD, or even Mac OS X, if that suits you better. We're not trying to 
start a controversy over which operating system is better or more secure. 
In fact, this has nothing to do with the security of the operating system 
itself, but the fact that 99.9% of these trojans were constructed for 
Windows and will fail to run on anything else.
The easiest approach is downloading a Linux live CD, booting from it, 
performing the online banking tasks, then removing it and restarting back 
into Windows. Need to open an excel spreadsheet, browse, check email or 
access a network storage? The Ubuntu Linux live CD will allow you to run 
Firefox, OpenOffice and perform most of the basic tasks without installing 
anything on the local disk.

Hi Akhilesh,

 

I want share something on this, Email circulation on regular basis makes
more attention to users to take necessary action. As per your suggestion
monthly basis circulation , sometime avoided by the users to have bulk
links/information/news in a single mail.

 

Thanks & Regards,

Well, It is an open discussion forum where everyone's suggestions are always
welcome and respected. There are around 600+ members here on the list with
obviously 1800+ different suggestions. Let us not make it an authoritative
discussion channel and that is the reason we are not that rigid at
moderation. Someone posted, else one commented, one accepted, no reason to
be sarcastic and thread closed automatically. 

 

Atleast appreciate the one (if that is not that difficult), who thought of
contributing to the community (which is really unusual here) but probably
not with the right approach, which was well commented and accepted. I gain
90% of my updates by reading 10% of notifications (emails, RSS, tweets) but
I still respect rest of the 90% notifications because I hardly contribute
even 10% back. Hard mathematics but simple than InfoSec.

 

With all due respect, I hope this thread can be closed! There are tons of
different things to be talked about.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Wow! Just to add further:

 

Watch for:

 

pnbindia.com

pnbindia.in

 

Can you see the difference? Dig and whois can be helpful and this link can add more: http://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=pnbindia.com. Though, Infected links seem to have removed.

 

I have got some good links in PNB, let me help them out with this. 

 

Phish the Fish! ;-)

And this has already claimed few customers' accounts ;)

Few days back a news channel was running the report of a Delhi guy who
entered his username/passwords in a pop-up while he was trying to login into
his PNB NetBnaking account.

I wonder how come a government/nationalized bank can have such poor security
for online transaction.I was unable to see the pages correctly on firefox as
that is the only browser i have apart from this the portal has no secure
signing authority like verisign or thawte.

This is simply unacceptable.Lots of poor peoples account are unsafe.We know
rthe trick so we are safe what about others.
The worst part is one of  the contct-us page mail id bounces back.

Oops! PNB officials are already on the list. Though I forwarded to him directly with Cc to GM IT. Some action is hopeful.

 

By the way, The phishing form redirects to pnbindia.com. So it not only collects the credit card numbers but also compromise the victim through drive-by-download method which seems to be taken off at the moment.

Incidents so that the loss can be minimised.

Details required for the Incident Reporting are given below:

E-mail ID:  incident at cert-in.org.in
Incident Response Help Desk phone: +91-11-24368572
Fax : +91-1800-11-6969

Googling for PNB gives www.pnbindia.com as firts link but Norton says it's
'unsafe; site. Norton treat pnbindia.in as 'safe' site.

As per Whois and Netcratft pnbindia.com is fake one which actually hosted in
US, I suppose whereas pnbindia.in is hosted in India.

Correct me, if I am wrong!!

With 340 million Chinese people online and earnings worth US$ 600 million,
Google is unlikely to do so.
However, the security issue as google said in its press release was not at
Google's end rather it was irked at the Phishing attacks and use of malware
by some suspected govt officials spying regularly on Chinese and European
human right activists.

Seems like its been exacting phish busting day for me.
while chatting with a friend suddenly
This wallpaper is really cool I think you might just fall in love with it!
http://c40ac-h.image-myspace.info:85/userfiles/2d03ka/MVC-Picture003.JPEG.zipThis
crazy thing appeared and my friend was disconnected from chat.
After going through the url i noticed the portal/site is cracked
http://c40ac-h.image-myspace.info:85/ which is evident after reading this
link.
Its just crazy.

I am not sure why they have multiple sites. Initial thought that came to my
mind was phishing. So I fired a DNS look up query on both the domains. The
following is the result.

* A quick DNS look up:*

*PNBIndia.in*:
http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois/?tool_id=66&token=&toolhandler_redirect=0&ip=www.pnbindia.in
*PNBIndia.com*:
http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois/?tool_id=66&token=&toolhandler_redirect=0&ip=www.pnbindia.com

Surprisingly NET4India is the registrar for both the URLs.

Additionally, just out of curiosity, i tried the following as well:

*PNBIndia.co.in*:
http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois/?tool_id=66&token=&toolhandler_redirect=0&ip=pnbindia.co.in

The contact person for PNBIndia.in and PNBIndia.co.in is same. "Tarun
Shahani"

@Parmendra
I have mailed them.I have allready done that but i really dont have patince
to download I just hate there way/method who has got so much patience to
download the form and then fill it up?
I wonder why can`t they come up with nice web-form for registering the
incident.this is just overdo and we are doing it for a common cause.its more
like adding pain rather than submitting incidence.

Hi Atul,

For any further incident report them at the given id it will definately
work.
Fill the form once they ask you to do so but in such cases they will never
ask it is because such kind of incidents are their primary concerns. Form
filling is required to have the additional details regarding the incident
reporting party as well as the type of the reported incident but in this
case the picture is clear.

Hi Atul,

Agreed with your point but it takes some time for the things to get
implemented. This thing is already in process and will be implemented soon.

I worked with CERT-In for 2.5 years and has noticed this issue. We already
discussed about the problem in incident reporting and trying to make it more
better / easier than it is now.

I wonder why can`t they come up with nice web-form for registering the incident.this is just overdo and we are doing it for a common cause.its more like adding pain rather than submitting incidence.

Dear All,

 

May please report any phishing incident related to any Indian bank to Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) for the quick removal / deactivation of the phishing website. 

 

Together with this you may also report any incident related to Malware Infection or something which seems to be a threat to Information Security.

 

This is because CERT-In coordinates with the ISPs and Other National CERTs and Indian Constituencies for the quick eradication of the reported Incidents so that the loss can be minimised.

 

Details required for the Incident Reporting are given below:

@Parmendra.
Sounds good.
Still i hope we have someone here in the list who can explain me why a pdf
and why not a webform. KISS (keep it simple stupid) method always and
everywhere works better in my opinion.

If you try for ?pnb net banking? in goggle, the first URL is http://netpnb.com/index.html.  The home page provides a tab for retail banking, which on clicking takes you to a https page with a mail id incident at pnb.co.in<mailto:incident at pnb.co.in> for reporting phishing.

Hi Atul,

For any further incident report them at the given id it will definately work.
Fill the form once they ask you to do so but in such cases they will never ask it is because such kind of incidents are their primary concerns. Form filling is required to have the additional details regarding the incident reporting party as well as the type of the reported incident but in this case the picture is clear.

I have mailed them.I have allready done that but i really dont have patince to download I just hate there way/method who has got so much patience to download the form and then fill it up?
I wonder why can`t they come up with nice web-form for registering the incident.this is just overdo and we are doing it for a common cause.its more like adding pain rather than submitting incidence.

Dear All,

May please report any phishing incident related to any Indian bank to Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) for the quick removal / deactivation of the phishing website.

Together with this you may also report any incident related to Malware Infection or something which seems to be a threat to Information Security.

This is because CERT-In coordinates with the ISPs and Other National CERTs and Indian Constituencies for the quick eradication of the reported Incidents so that the loss can be minimised.

Details required for the Incident Reporting are given below:

Strange! Infact, pnbindia.com, pnbindia.in both are theirs. One hosted in India and other in US. Drop down menu works for .in and doesn?t work in .com. .com is detected as infected and .in ain?t which made me thought that one is owned and other ain?t. Phew!

I wonder how come a government/nationalized bank can have such poor security for online transaction.I was unable to see the pages correctly on firefox as that is the only browser i have apart from this the portal has no secure signing authority like verisign or thawte.

This is simply unacceptable.Lots of poor peoples account are unsafe.We know rthe trick so we are safe what about others.
The worst part is one of  the contct-us page mail id bounces back.

@Atul,
For CERT-In, it is not about the method but the process an organisation follows. 
pdf process might seems to you as KISS (keep it simple stupid) but follows the government instructions where a national security agency (CERT-In) has to keep records of the reporting person and subsequently the action taken on the reported incidents. 
As a fact, in India a normal user or even professionals are still not using their digital identities (like digital certificates or keys). Then how the authenticity of the reported person will be established? On which basis a national security agency will take action? 
I just co-relate with a business process of a bank. Why do you need to fill Pay-in-slip form for any deposits u make for ur account? It's in same way....
However filling pdf form is not mandatory and CERT-In acts on reports received on e-mail (incident at cert-in.org.in).

@Parmendra.
Sounds good.
Still i hope we have someone here in the list who can explain me why a pdf and why not a webform. KISS (keep it simple stupid) method always and everywhere works better in my opinion.

Hi Atul,
 
For any further incident report them at the given id it will definately work.

Fill the form once they ask you to do so but in such cases they will never ask it is because such kind of incidents are their primary concerns. Form filling is required to have the additional details regarding the incident reporting party as well as the type of the reported incident but in this case the picture is clear.

I have mailed them.I have allready done that but i really dont have patince to download I just hate there way/method who has got so much patience to download the form and then fill it up?



I wonder why can`t they come up with nice web-form for registering the incident.this is just overdo and we are doing it for a common cause.its more like adding pain rather than submitting incidence.

Dear All,
 
May please report any phishing incident related to any Indian bank to Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) for the quick removal / deactivation of the phishing website. 



 
Together with this you may also report any incident related to Malware Infection or something which seems to be a threat to Information Security.
 
This is because CERT-In coordinates with the ISPs and Other National CERTs and Indian Constituencies for the quick eradication of the reported Incidents so that the loss can be minimised.



 
Details required for the Incident Reporting are given below:
 
E-mail ID:  incident at cert-in.org.in
Incident Response Help Desk phone: +91-11-24368572 
Fax : +91-1800-11-6969

On the other hand

http://samspade.org/whois/pnb.co.in] I was not able to get whois information
for www.pnbindia.com

I also tried calling number 011-23765434 which is mentioned on the account
owner contact detail for [www.pnb.net.in] for authenticity but no one was

Now as 4 tomorrow my task-list includes calling same number again and

I still not aware why they have two different whois result [as in owner]

@Atul,
For CERT-In, it is not about the method but the process an organisation follows. 
pdf process might seems to you as KISS (keep it simple stupid) but follows the government instructions where a national security agency (CERT-In) has to keep records of the reporting person and subsequently the action taken on the reported incidents. 
As a fact, in India a normal user or even professionals are still not using their digital identities (like digital certificates or keys). Then how the authenticity of the reported person will be established? On which basis a national security agency will take action? 
I just co-relate with a business process of a bank. Why do you need to fill Pay-in-slip form for any deposits u make for ur account? It's in same way....
However filling pdf form is not mandatory and CERT-In acts on reports received on e-mail (incident at cert-in.org.in).

@Parmendra.
Sounds good.
Still i hope we have someone here in the list who can explain me why a pdf and why not a webform. KISS (keep it simple stupid) method always and everywhere works better in my opinion.

Hi Atul,
 
For any further incident report them at the given id it will definately work.

Fill the form once they ask you to do so but in such cases they will never ask it is because such kind of incidents are their primary concerns. Form filling is required to have the additional details regarding the incident reporting party as well as the type of the reported incident but in this case the picture is clear.

I have mailed them.I have allready done that but i really dont have patince to download I just hate there way/method who has got so much patience to download the form and then fill it up?



I wonder why can`t they come up with nice web-form for registering the incident.this is just overdo and we are doing it for a common cause.its more like adding pain rather than submitting incidence.

Dear All,
 
May please report any phishing incident related to any Indian bank to Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) for the quick removal / deactivation of the phishing website. 



 
Together with this you may also report any incident related to Malware Infection or something which seems to be a threat to Information Security.
 
This is because CERT-In coordinates with the ISPs and Other National CERTs and Indian Constituencies for the quick eradication of the reported Incidents so that the loss can be minimised.



 
Details required for the Incident Reporting are given below:
 
E-mail ID:  incident at cert-in.org.in
Incident Response Help Desk phone: +91-11-24368572 
Fax : +91-1800-11-6969 
Incident Reporting form available at: http://www.cert-in.org.in/incidentreporting.htm

Unfortunately for us, not many are really aware of phishing...Believe it or not, there are people (even in the software industry) who still fall for the Nigerean scam L

 

And security is still the last item in the agenda of all banks in India... L

I wonder how come a government/nationalized bank can have such poor security for online transaction.I was unable to see the pages correctly on firefox as that is the only browser i have apart from this the portal has no secure signing authority like verisign or thawte.

This is simply unacceptable.Lots of poor peoples account are unsafe.We know rthe trick so we are safe what about others.

Actually, in China, google is not really big...Their local search engine Baidu is more popular and has captured more than 60% of the serach engine market

 

Google entered into China for "political" reasons.. And it looks like google has her fingers burned trusting China J

 

Just like how we got our fingers burned when we trusted them L

With 340 million Chinese people online and earnings worth US$ 600 million, Google is unlikely to do so.
However, the security issue as google said in its press release was not at Google's end rather it was irked at the Phishing attacks and use of malware by some suspected govt officials spying regularly on Chinese and European human right activists.

Very interesting, but would really like to know the basis on which they think the attack originated from China, was it analysis of IP address which seems to be from China ? the report itself says that attackers used multiple proxies to reach target, then what was the process used to identify the actual original point ?

 

Did the malware embedded in PDF had any specific signatures which suggest this link ?

 

Would love to go in to deep in this case

I am in touch with the concerned people conducting the investigation. Through unofficial channels I can say that the data espionage process had three pronged approach. Using the compromised data centre, anonymous VPNs and TOR exit relays. The investigating party conducted the counter espionage operation and compromised one of the data centres used in the attack. Through this way they were able to trace the real mothership of the attack i.e. China.

This incident is quite significant to start a new thread so that people who
might not have noticed in earlier post can also know and comment. I am
indirectly in touch with the investigators who are behind this commendable
job. They were part of the OWASP conference and most likely known to
participants who were there. This is the first time that govt. of India had
the will, candour and the tenacity to respond to such a situation.

I am in touch with the concerned people conducting the investigation. Through unofficial channels I can say that the data espionage process had three pronged approach. Using the compromised data centre, anonymous VPNs and TOR exit relays. The investigating party conducted the counter espionage operation and compromised one of the data centres used in the attack. Through this way they were able to trace the real mothership of the attack i.e. China.

Very interesting, but would really like to know the basis on which they think the attack originated from China, was it analysis of IP address which seems to be from China ? the report itself says that attackers used multiple proxies to reach target, then what was the process used to identify the actual original point ?

 

Did the malware embedded in PDF had any specific signatures which suggest this link ?

The answer to your question may hurt patriotic sentiments and I'd agree with you ($ and MNC part). 

The lesser said the better for now though let's not pride ourslves as IT giants and begin criticizing ourselves to understand what's wrong; is all Ill add!

Dhruv,
 
Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and co-ordinated effort.

Hi, 

 

Today newspapers are floated with story saying that it was Russians who
were behind the attack not Chinese, is that true ? or a result of new
findings in the investigations ?

Yesterday only, on a news channel I was watching a program related to the
issue where a key govt. authority was assuring 'again and again' that the
attack had been detected in its early stage and there's 'no need to worry'.
No data has been compromised and we are developing some 'indigenous'
firewall for better protection. :)

Hi Sanjay and Muslim,

 

As we know, Russians are more known for cyber mafia infrastructure and RBN economics which was used just as a gateway here and I clarified this in my last email as well. Media is doing their best job in trying to cook more over it to make it appear that their channel has got the accurate news and others don?t. Below are some more links to press coverage: 

 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA24fpap31M

http://www.viddler.com/explore/antipreneur/videos/1/

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Russian-mafia-may-be-behind-PMO-cyber-attack/articleshow/5450430.cms

http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\01\16\story_16-1-2010_pg7_25

 <http://www.hindustantimes.com/No-breach-in-computer-security-system-PMO/H1-Article1-497598.aspx> http://www.hindustantimes.com/No-breach-in-computer-security-system-PMO/H1-Article1-497598.aspx 

 

The only thing investigators found later, this attack was not limited to just 32 officials as has been highlighted in almost every news channel or newspaper so far. Rather, the attack was carried out against not 100 or 200 but more than 450+ key govt. officials. Upcoming news reports might have this update.

 

I agree to your point Sanjay and I would say if we don?t build up a mutli-pronged cyber security policy in the interest of national security today, it would be too late. This particular attack raised the eyebrows of many govt. officials and is directly being briefed to NSA, so all officials involved are equally concerned. Attack used a 0-day vulnerability and an already compromised account which could have been carried out against any individual or country undetected through security devices/antivirus software. The best thing which I appreciate and congratulated the investigators that this time we were better equipped to handle the situation. Better means, better than even what US cyber security teams might have done.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Dhruv,

 

Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and co-ordinated effort.

Hi,
 In any battle causing chaos in the oippositions camp is the biggest advantage. I say instead of trying secure everything; provide pathways with falsified information. Its more damaging for the attacker to have information they cannot trust than having little they can. It'll knock the wind out their future attempts. I've found this style highly effective!  

Carefully designed path ways that lure attackers in false areas. Hackers usually are encouraged by success. Let them believe they are succeeding and you've got them :)

Well if anyone needs me u just lemme know!

Stop using IE because same exploit is now available in metasploit, available to script kiddies. Here is the complete information with video as well: http://praetorianprefect.com/archives/2010/01/the-aurora-ie-exploit-in-action/

 

Many attackers are capitalizing on this one. It started with a targeted attack and now is suspected to lead to a large-scale attack.

I am in touch with the concerned people conducting the investigation. Through unofficial channels I can say that the data espionage process had three pronged approach. Using the compromised data centre, anonymous VPNs and TOR exit relays. The investigating party conducted the counter espionage operation and compromised one of the data centres used in the attack. Through this way they were able to trace the real mothership of the attack i.e. China.

Very interesting, but would really like to know the basis on which they think the attack originated from China, was it analysis of IP address which seems to be from China ? the report itself says that attackers used multiple proxies to reach target, then what was the process used to identify the actual original point ?

 

Did the malware embedded in PDF had any specific signatures which suggest this link ?

 

Would love to go in to deep in this case

Precisely saying:

The Microsoft Internet Explorer vulnerability leveraged in this attack
allows for remote code execution, but does require user intervention (such
as following a hyperlink to a website, or opening an email attachment, etc).
Furthermore, the single exploit known to exist can be thwarted by Data
Execution Prevention (DEP), enabled by default in Internet Explorer 8 and
optionally in Internet Explorer 7.  Microsoft lists the following
combinations to be vulnerable: Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on
Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, and Internet Explorer 6, Internet
Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on supported editions of Windows XP,
Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and
Windows Server 2008 R2 are affected.

government staff fall into that 22% category because of which such incidents
occur :(

Hi Dhruv,
 
thnk for the update. I am amazed and it is a learning on how the Chinese have a very strong "content filtering firewall" and much less vulnerable than anyone else. Not sure if this is the right fora, but the key proactive and predictive strategy would come with ISP's in India taking a lead and actively involved in a larger security policy framework, cert-in can be mostly a facilitator.

Hi Sanjay and Muslim,

 

As we know, Russians are more known for cyber mafia infrastructure and RBN economics which was used just as a gateway here and I clarified this in my last email as well. Media is doing their best job in trying to cook more over it to make it appear that their channel has got the accurate news and others don't. Below are some more links to press coverage:

http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\01\16\story_16-1-2010_pg7_25

http://www.hindustantimes.com/No-breach-in-computer-security-system-PMO/H1-Article1-497598.aspx <http://www.hindustantimes.com/No-breach-in-computer-security-system-PMO/H1-Article1-497598.aspx>  

 

The only thing investigators found later, this attack was not limited to just 32 officials as has been highlighted in almost every news channel or newspaper so far. Rather, the attack was carried out against not 100 or 200 but more than 450+ key govt. officials. Upcoming news reports might have this update.

 

I agree to your point Sanjay and I would say if we don't build up a mutli-pronged cyber security policy in the interest of national security today, it would be too late. This particular attack raised the eyebrows of many govt. officials and is directly being briefed to NSA, so all officials involved are equally concerned. Attack used a 0-day vulnerability and an already compromised account which could have been carried out against any individual or country undetected through security devices/antivirus software. The best thing which I appreciate and congratulated the investigators that this time we were better equipped to handle the situation. Better means, better than even what US cyber security teams might have done.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Dhruv,

 

Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and co-ordinated effort.

As stated in the news clipping as well, key govt. functionaries like Deputy NSA, Climate Change Envoy were compromised so it was a real serious attack. But damage containment started in just a few minutes after the incident. I know the patriotic zeal of these people and we should be proud of them.

This incident is quite significant to start a new thread so that people who might not have noticed in earlier post can also know and comment. I am indirectly in touch with the investigators who are behind this commendable job. They were part of the OWASP conference and most likely known to participants who were there. This is the first time that govt. of India had the will, candour and the tenacity to respond to such a situation.

Hi Sanjay, 

 

I don?t think ISP?s in India can take lead on this, Chinese are successful in doing this because of strong will of Govt. In handling these issues. In India where most of the things are at the hands of Private players its becomes very difficult to implement these solutions. Especially because if the Bureaucratic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic_collectivism>    process in the govt. People will only look for ways out even if such ordinance in passed by government and it will take years to implement them and that will also be non-effective implementation. 

 

I anyone can take lead on this, it has to be government who will have to take care of things from start to end, just passing an order and making mandatory for ISPs to have these solutions will help.

Hi Dhruv,

 

thnk for the update. I am amazed and it is a learning on how the Chinese have a very strong "content filtering firewall" and much less vulnerable than anyone else. Not sure if this is the right fora, but the key proactive and predictive strategy would come with ISP's in India taking a lead and actively involved in a larger security policy framework, cert-in can be mostly a facilitator.

Hi Sanjay and Muslim,

 

As we know, Russians are more known for cyber mafia infrastructure and RBN economics which was used just as a gateway here and I clarified this in my last email as well. Media is doing their best job in trying to cook more over it to make it appear that their channel has got the accurate news and others don?t. Below are some more links to press coverage:

http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\01\16\story_16-1-2010_pg7_25

http://www.hindustantimes.com/No-breach-in-computer-security-system-PMO/H1-Article1-497598.aspx <http://www.hindustantimes.com/No-breach-in-computer-security-system-PMO/H1-Article1-497598.aspx>  

 

The only thing investigators found later, this attack was not limited to just 32 officials as has been highlighted in almost every news channel or newspaper so far. Rather, the attack was carried out against not 100 or 200 but more than 450+ key govt. officials. Upcoming news reports might have this update.

 

I agree to your point Sanjay and I would say if we don?t build up a mutli-pronged cyber security policy in the interest of national security today, it would be too late. This particular attack raised the eyebrows of many govt. officials and is directly being briefed to NSA, so all officials involved are equally concerned. Attack used a 0-day vulnerability and an already compromised account which could have been carried out against any individual or country undetected through security devices/antivirus software. The best thing which I appreciate and congratulated the investigators that this time we were better equipped to handle the situation. Better means, better than even what US cyber security teams might have done.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Dhruv,

 

Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and co-ordinated effort.

As stated in the news clipping as well, key govt. functionaries like Deputy NSA, Climate Change Envoy were compromised so it was a real serious attack. But damage containment started in just a few minutes after the incident. I know the patriotic zeal of these people and we should be proud of them.

This incident is quite significant to start a new thread so that people who might not have noticed in earlier post can also know and comment. I am indirectly in touch with the investigators who are behind this commendable job. They were part of the OWASP conference and most likely known to participants who were there. This is the first time that govt. of India had the will, candour and the tenacity to respond to such a situation.

Very True,

  It is commendable that the NTRO was able to contain the damage and trace 
back the origin of the attack. 
I agree with the 'cyber army' idea. But, there is already a  Cyber Warfare 
department of the Govt of India. We can rather join that !

There is surely a lot happening in the Government and what remains to be
seen is the official formation of a Cyber Security Authority which may be
under the Min of Defense or may report to the PMO directly. In any case,
there is a lot more at stake in the face of a "cyber attack" as we all
know.

The media will talk about defacement and we all are looking for breaches and
compromised servers / information.

While we may have secured the pathways to the PMO and the 450 + departments,
have we also done the same for critical infrastructure ? The railways,
electricity grid, nuclear facilities, e-governance network .... all this
stuff  ? Everything is "connected" and we know the state of security at most
places is not something to be proud of.

There is a lot we can say and do but I would like to make a point here -
before we think of raising our personal mohalla cyber armies and wage war,
or go to light candles to express our solidarity with the hacked departments
let us think about the work we do - how proud are you about the information
security implementation that has been undertaken in any major / minor
organization ? How confident you are that that organization will be able to
repel / contain / respond to a breach. Rather do you think your client will
be able to recognize an attack ! So first let us stop clients from asking
for substandard implementations (they work on dynamically shrinking budgets
and the consultants are forced to cut corners)

Once the buyer imbibes the culture of recognizing and demanding quality work
half the battle will be won at home itself !

Dinesh

Following these clues you should figure your way to the next level.
Once you have reached the final level you'll know how to claim the
booty.
2. Hints will be provided for each level through twitter or null
mailing list or nullcon.net website. More details will be available
shortly.
3. This challenge does NOT give participants any legal permission to
exploit http://nullcon.net or its hosting partner in a destructive
manner . Any attack against the site or the hosted servers will be
observed under general legal framework.

M,

I agree with your viewpoint. It's the strong "will" of the red which made
averyone bow down.

Hi Sanjay,

I don?t think ISP?s in India can take lead on this, Chinese are successful
in doing this because of strong will of Govt. In handling these issues. In
India where most of the things are at the hands of Private players its
becomes very difficult to implement these solutions. Especially because if
the Bureaucratic ??process in the govt. People will only look for ways out
even if such ordinance in passed by government and it will take years to
implement them and that will also be non-effective implementation.

I anyone can take lead on this, it has to be government who will have to
take care of things from start to end, just passing an order and making
mandatory for ISPs to have these solutions will help.

Hi Dhruv,

thnk for the update. I am amazed and it is a learning on how the Chinese
have a very strong "content filtering firewall" and much less vulnerable
than anyone else. Not sure if this is the right fora, but the key proactive
and predictive strategy would come with ISP's in India taking a lead and
actively involved in a larger security policy framework, cert-in can be
mostly a facilitator.

Hi Sanjay and Muslim,

As we know, Russians are more known for cyber mafia infrastructure and RBN
economics which was used just as a gateway here and I clarified this in my
last email as well. Media is doing their best job in trying to cook more
over it to make it appear that their channel has got the accurate news and
others don?t. Below are some more links to press coverage:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA24fpap31M
http://www.viddler.com/explore/antipreneur/videos/1/
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Russian-mafia-may-be-behind-PMO-cyber-attack/articleshow/5450430.cms
http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\01\16\story_16-1-2010_pg7_25
http://www.hindustantimes.com/No-breach-in-computer-security-system-PMO/H1-Article1-497598.aspx


The only thing investigators found later, this attack was not limited to
just 32 officials as has been highlighted in almost every news channel or
newspaper so far. Rather, the attack was carried out against not 100 or 200
but more than 450+ key govt. officials. Upcoming news reports might have
this update.

I agree to your point Sanjay and I would say if we don?t build up a
mutli-pronged cyber security policy in the interest of national security
today, it would be too late. This particular attack raised the eyebrows of
many govt. officials and is directly being briefed to NSA, so all officials
involved are equally concerned. Attack used a 0-day vulnerability and an
already compromised account which could have been carried out against any
individual or country undetected through security devices/antivirus
software. The best thing which I appreciate and congratulated the
investigators that this time we were better equipped to handle the
situation. Better means, better than even what US cyber security teams
might have done.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Dhruv,

Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the
Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and
predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage
and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and
co-ordinated effort.

 As stated in the news clipping as well, key govt. functionaries like       
 Deputy NSA, Climate Change Envoy were compromised so it was a real serious 
 attack. But damage containment started in just a few minutes after the     
 incident. I know the patriotic zeal of these people and we should be proud 
 of them.

 This incident is quite significant to start a new thread so that people    
 who might not have noticed in earlier post can also know and comment. I am 
 indirectly in touch with the investigators who are behind this commendable 
 job. They were part of the OWASP conference and most likely known to       
 participants who were there. This is the first time that govt. of India    
 had the will, candour and the tenacity to respond to such a situation.

Agreed fully Muslim. On top of that the corrupt bureaucrats is another layer that we have to fight...

 

Going by what Dhruv Soi says about the patriotic people within the departments, what about the ministerial babus, who have just joined the election fray to make money? Even if we can get all the security layers secured reasonably well, we still have the corruption angle to be addressed...and who knows when that will be addressed?

As we know, Russians are more known for cyber mafia infrastructure and RBN economics which was used just as a gateway here and I clarified this in my last email as well. Media is doing their best job in trying to cook more over it to make it appear that their channel has got the accurate news and others don?t. Below are some more links to press coverage:

The only thing investigators found later, this attack was not limited to just 32 officials as has been highlighted in almost every news channel or newspaper so far. Rather, the attack was carried out against not 100 or 200 but more than 450+ key govt. officials. Upcoming news reports might have this update.

 

I agree to your point Sanjay and I would say if we don?t build up a mutli-pronged cyber security policy in the interest of national security today, it would be too late. This particular attack raised the eyebrows of many govt. officials and is directly being briefed to NSA, so all officials involved are equally concerned. Attack used a 0-day vulnerability and an already compromised account which could have been carried out against any individual or country undetected through security devices/antivirus software. The best thing which I appreciate and congratulated the investigators that this time we were better equipped to handle the situation. Better means, better than even what US cyber security teams might have done.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Dhruv,

 

Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and co-ordinated effort.

As stated in the news clipping as well, key govt. functionaries like Deputy NSA, Climate Change Envoy were compromised so it was a real serious attack. But damage containment started in just a few minutes after the incident. I know the patriotic zeal of these people and we should be proud of them.

This incident is quite significant to start a new thread so that people who might not have noticed in earlier post can also know and comment. I am indirectly in touch with the investigators who are behind this commendable job. They were part of the OWASP conference and most likely known to participants who were there. This is the first time that govt. of India had the will, candour and the tenacity to respond to such a situation.

But as you correctly pointed out, these people alone can only do things to a certain point, and to have control over the internet which china has, it will take large number such teams to provide tech support and Babus and netas have to understand this as real problem.

Don?t raise your expectations so quickly my friends, it is just the beginning. There are and will be lot of bureaucratic challenges, lots of babus/netas on the way, sooner or later it has to happen. Either system will drive this or will get driven, there won?t be any alternative left. But yes, indeed things take huge time in govt. and so will this particular one.

 

This issue is now at diplomatic level, read this one: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6991789.ece India?s NSA and China?s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson comments over this cyber espionage.

Hi Sanjay and Muslim,

 

As we know, Russians are more known for cyber mafia infrastructure and RBN economics which was used just as a gateway here and I clarified this in my last email as well. Media is doing their best job in trying to cook more over it to make it appear that their channel has got the accurate news and others don?t. Below are some more links to press coverage:

The only thing investigators found later, this attack was not limited to just 32 officials as has been highlighted in almost every news channel or newspaper so far. Rather, the attack was carried out against not 100 or 200 but more than 450+ key govt. officials. Upcoming news reports might have this update.

 

I agree to your point Sanjay and I would say if we don?t build up a mutli-pronged cyber security policy in the interest of national security today, it would be too late. This particular attack raised the eyebrows of many govt. officials and is directly being briefed to NSA, so all officials involved are equally concerned. Attack used a 0-day vulnerability and an already compromised account which could have been carried out against any individual or country undetected through security devices/antivirus software. The best thing which I appreciate and congratulated the investigators that this time we were better equipped to handle the situation. Better means, better than even what US cyber security teams might have done.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Dhruv,

 

Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and co-ordinated effort.

As stated in the news clipping as well, key govt. functionaries like Deputy NSA, Climate Change Envoy were compromised so it was a real serious attack. But damage containment started in just a few minutes after the incident. I know the patriotic zeal of these people and we should be proud of them.

This incident is quite significant to start a new thread so that people who might not have noticed in earlier post can also know and comment. I am indirectly in touch with the investigators who are behind this commendable job. They were part of the OWASP conference and most likely known to participants who were there. This is the first time that govt. of India had the will, candour and the tenacity to respond to such a situation.

I hope that this is an eye opener for those babus and sincerely support the
work that the investigators have have been doing. I think it boils down to
how the govt. is willing to support and encourage security profs(read
hackers) to join hands with them. Chinese have demonstrated this already :-)
Do we always have to learn from mistakes :-P

Twitter bans 370 'obvious' passwords 

01 Jan 2010


<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/6906781/Twitter-bans-370-obvious-passwords.html> The micro-blogging service rejects certain passwords when new users sign up if it thinks they are too easy to guess. However, bloggers recently discovered that the list of banned passwords is embedded in the source code of the page itself.

 

Banned terms include commonly chosen generic passwords, such as ?123456?, ?password? and ?password1?, as well as car names (?porsche?, ?ferrari?) and football teams (?Chelsea?, ?arsenal?).

?

Perhaps predictably for a website popular with technology fans, science fiction terms figure in the list too. ?THX1138?, the title of the first feature film directed by George Lucas of Star Wars fame, is banned, as is ?NCC1701? ? the registry number of Star Trek?s starship Enterprise ? and ?trustno1?, which was Fox Mulder?s password in The X-Files.

 

Research has shown that people are often all too predictable when it comes to choosing passwords. In research published earlier this year, insurer CPP found that nearly half of Britons use the same password to login to their banking, shopping and social networking sites. The research also found that one in five people use their pets? names for their passwords, while one in eight use memorable dates, such as birthdays, and one in ten use their children?s names.

 

Security experts advise that a strong password should consist of letters, numbers and even punctuation symbols. They should be changed regularly and you should not use the same password for all your online services.

Zuber.

I just wanted to share with you that there is a massive scam being operated
from Pakistan. Under this scam, you will receive a missed call (single ring)
from Pakistani number (+92 country code). If you call back they will state
that they tried to reach you and are from Airtel. If you question that
number is international they will say Airtel has got many global campaigning
numbers and reason for the call is that you won 2,00,000 Rs. from a lucky
draw at Airtel. To claim the prize you need to recharge your mobile (If
prepaid) by telling the PIN number of your debit/credit card and same for
advance post-paid payment.

 

Same scam was carried against Dubai based telecom company called Etisalat
and is now launched against Airtel in India. Reports claims that there has
been theft of subscribers information from Airtel that has facilitated this
scam.

 

Its been 4rth missed call to my mobile but before I would have called back,
luckily I found their traces over the internet. Search on google with
keyword "Missed calls from Pakistan" to know more about this scam. 

 

Do inform your family, friends, contacts about this scam because everyone
might not be an Indian InfoSec Warrior J

I too got a missed call from Pak some time back and as a habit called back
only to realize the whole deal.

BTW email phishing attempts seem to be on a rise big time, get an email
almost daily from SBI's and PNB's of the phishing world.

I hope they realize it sooner.

The Financial organizations such as banks should have trademark webpage

has
been theft of subscribers information from Airtel that has facilitated
this
scam.



Its been 4rth missed call to my mobile but before I would have called
back,
luckily I found their traces over the internet. Search on google with
keyword "Missed calls from Pakistan" to know more about this scam.



Do inform your family, friends, contacts about this scam because
everyone
might not be an Indian InfoSec Warrior J

Well web developers can't solve phishing  problem but they can prevent XSS and other attacks like session hijacking.  More IT focus n hiring professional services *may* help them. 

The problem is the "Babu" culture; even if they hired prof servises I fear lack to responsibility will make anything slip with em! I guess this is the only way they will learn... Through their mistakes!

..BTW I got a call from a +92 num claiming they were from airtel and asking for my home address. 

What got me suspicious was not that it was from Pak but that your phone provider has your address and will never ask for it!

If it was a leak from airtel DB the addresses would have been leaked too; which doesn't seem to be the case.

I reported it to the police; they came to my house and noted it but sadly they did not recognize it a threat to national security. One day we all are going to pay the price for the apathy that prevails in our culture.

Am wondering if we can form a central body, org that can handle such reports and setup task force to counter act!?!

Hey,

Today I got a call +92 # from HDFC, caller confirmed my name and phone number and then asking if I received my check book from the bank. I played along and said Yes. 2nd question: So this month how much are you expecting your salary amount? I played along. 3rd Q: can you please confirm your last 4 digit of your credit card #? I played along. 4th Q: Can you confirm your address please. By this time, I exhausted my patience. Asked him why is he alling, gave a piece of my mind. By then he started stammering and quickly changed to a topic - Sir we are giving a free life time credit card ...  
I ended the call by giving him the choicest of adjectives I knew ...

So guys beware ...

Regards,


Bishwaroop H

 

Regards!
Bishwaroop

I think we sometimes tend to overuse the blame-game on "Babu" culture.
You've got to deliver a working code tonight, and you end up putting 
performance and security  issues with a bunch of "//TODO:"s and 
"//FIXME:"s. This is the story almost everywhere. It's got little 
relation with the prior mentioned culture. Security holes primarily owe 
to the team culture, cumulative expertise, and (dare I say) the 
tech-lead's ACTUAL technical expertise instead of just years of 
experience on the resume.

Just my 2 cents (which I concede, isn't really adding much value from a 
technology perspective).

It has been found that some Chinese websites of domain .gov.cn are hosting
pages that exploit the the recent IE 0-day vulnerability.The same
vulnerability was exploited to compromise Google, Adobe, and other vendors
and also known as 'Aurora'.
 .wscz.gov.cn, .zhepb.gov.cn, .jssalt.gov.cn are few more websites where the
malware is being hosted.
It is said that due to intention of spying its own citizens, Chinese Govt is
sponsoring it. Or might be the case that these are also exploited by the
hackers.

hi OWASP Delhi,



Could 'sanitization' (input sanitization) be an effective remedy for sql injection ?



For XSS, which is better, input sanitization or output sanitization ?



Any industry standards for sanitizations ?

Hi Suresh,

I feel Input Sanitization or Input validation would be effective way.

In input sanitization mostly you need to check in request but in output
validation you need to check entire response which would be performance
intensive.

Praveen Darshanam

Input/output sanitization are fairly relative terms based on how YOU define. 

So I'd rather not indulge on definition part any more than just mention that "contextual" ( i.e., based on where the data's coming from, and it's going to be consumed) validation and encoding is what you need to be certain about :-)

Check OWASP pages on topic for further info.

both; 
input - to ensure the code does not create "injection/xss" attacks
output - to ensure response splitting and XSS as well.

Means we should sanitze both Request & Response Parameters........... period --- not to ask options if we expect considerable amount of reliability from web attacks.

Hi Suresh,
?
I feel Input Sanitization or Input validation would be effective way.
?
In input sanitization mostly you need to check in request but in output validation you need to check entire response which would be performance intensive.
?

hi OWASP Delhi,

Could 'sanitization' (input sanitization) be an effective remedy for sql injection ?


For XSS, which is better, input sanitization or output sanitization ?

Any industry standards for sanitizations ?

Thanks & regards,

For xss if you use Microsoft technology Antixss is the right choice.

Well I'm no expert on XSS, but generally I'd prefer input sanitization.

Consider the following:
1 with multiple interfaces (outputs) its easier and more secure to clean it at the source before persistence.

2 Many times the interfaces or outputs change. Developers may forget security constraints over time and buld sexy UIs that disregard earlier sanitization code.

3. Unsanitized data sitting in your DB can be atime bomb.

The points are correlated, but gives you a perspective why I'd rate input better but it depends on your scenario.

The only down of input sanitization is u gotta be careful how to do it; tougher than escaping XML on output. But theb again that's what OWASP AntiSamy tools are for :)

Hi, 

 

Perfectly explained!!!

 

Just want to add few notes on it...

 

1.       If you want to restrict user to enter unwanted inputs then you can
go for Input Validation other wise use Input Sanitization. Only difference
is whether you want to show a note "Rights of Admission Reserved" or not
:-)

2.       Well...In my opinion both should be implemented and Input
sanitization must occur before validation if it is impossible to validate
unsanitized data.

3.       White-listing approach should be used in accepting valid user
inputs, both at client and server side.

4.       Now about output ..if you are capable to validate all source of
inputs and you are 100% confident then actually it is not required but as
said below very accurately "Unsanitized data sitting in your DB can be a
time bomb" so just for safe side output encoding is recommended. 

 

Regards

Suman

Message-ID: <C2DA2F27EC154240843FA61A3BA9C7C2@user5de85830ff>

For more clarity:  

 

Proper input validation can ensure that malicious data is not inserted into
the system. However, it fails to provide the assurance that validated data
will remain consistent throughout its lifetime. For instance, if an insider
is allowed to insert data into a database without validation, it is possible
to glean unauthorized information or execute arbitrary code on the client
side by means of attacks such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS). Consequently,
output filtering is as important as input validation.

 

To ensure that any data that bypasses the validation does not cause
vulnerabilities, it is highly recommended that output characters be encoded,
except those that are known to be safe.

 

Here is an example of java code..

 

public class BadOutput {

  // description and input are String variables containing values obtained
from a database

  // description = "description" and input = "<script> executable code
</script>"

  public static void display(String description, String input) {

    // Display to the user or pass description and input to another system

  }

}

 

 

Example displays input obtained from a database directly to the user without
performing any output validation or encoding.

 

No need to say what can be done with this ..

 

 

Regards

Suman
