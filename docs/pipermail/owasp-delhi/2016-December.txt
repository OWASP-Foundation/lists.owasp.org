Asia
To: "owasp-delhi at lists.owasp.org" <owasp-delhi at lists.owasp.org>


Hi all,

FYI.

This is a good opportunity in case you have something to present in the
area of DevSecOps.

thanks
Sandeep




Hi Everyone,


We are inviting speakers from Asia Pacific for DevSecCon Asia
<http://www.devseccon.com/asia-2017/>, taking place on the 23rd of February
2017 at Raffles City Convention Centre, Singapore. This one-day, two-track
conference will revolve around ways to implement DevSecOps ? a new approach
that thrives to embed security in development and business processes, a
topic on the cusp of changing IT culture as we know it.

Following the success of DevSecCon London, we are delighted to be heading
to Singapore for over 200 practitioners to come together and share insights
and experiences to help our attendees challenge the status quo in their
organisations and radically rethink their approach to secure development
and delivery.

If you have a story, experience, or new tools to share which centre on
continuously secure delivery, we?d love to hear from you. You can submit
your proposal here <http://www.devseccon.com/asia-2017/call-for-proposals/>.

We are looking for proposals in the following areas:

   - *Lightning talks* (10 mins): Talks describing DevSecOps, DevOps and
   Security experiences ? the good, the bad and the ugly.
   - *Practices* (25 mins): Talks focussed on applying DevSecOps and
   continuously secure delivery in an organisation.
   - *Organisational change* (25 mins): Talks dedicated to cultural changes
   and how to implement them.
   - *Technical workshops* (1 ? 2 hrs): DevSecOps workshop to help our
   attendees practice new tools/techniques.

The call for proposals will close on the 31st of December 2016.

If you have any questions please contact us at info-asia at devseccon.com.



Kind Regards,



DevSecCon Asia
