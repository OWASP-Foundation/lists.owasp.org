Subject: [Owasp-leaders] ZAP 2.6.0 now available
To: "owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org" <owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>


I'm delighted to announce that we have just released ZAP 2.6.0:
https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads

Release notes are here: https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/
HelpReleases2_6_0

As you'll see this release includes some very important security fixes, so
please upgrade asap.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, especially the
security researchers who reported security issues to us via our bug bounty
program <https://bugcrowd.com/owaspzap> - see the release notes for more
details.

This release uses new installers, so if you have any problems with those
please let us know asap.

The Mac OS installer should be correctly signed - we're still in the
process of getting a code signing certificate, and we plan to sign the
Windows release once we have got that.

Simon
