<PRE>This is all about mitigating the risk..  (If there is no control in
place, there is risk. If all the relevant controls are in place, still
there would be some risk).
 
That's depends upon the business, how they would like to proceed with RA
(Risk Assessment). If they find the application is critical to business
they will put extra control in place like having SSL, if the application
has least severity in terms of impacting the business.. they may not go
with the SSL.
 
I hope this will clarify your doubts.
 
 
Regards,
 
RS

Dear Shekhar,

It is not only about Outside world attacks, It is about internal Risk
factors and Internal Attacks. What If an attacker Or Disgruntled
employee sniff the internal network.

So SSL is req. as if the org. is handling Highly sensitive data.

	hello there group..
	
	This is a simple question, could you please let us know of your
thoughts?
	
	I have come across a few professionals who argue, why do we need
SSL within our organisation?
	
	
	Isnt Firewall and a decent IDS/IPS sufficient to prevent attacks
from outside world?
	
	so if you work or own a company would you consider SSL within
your organisation, perhaps not for intranet but for applications that
raise the bar on risk.
	
	your thoughts please?
	
	cheers
