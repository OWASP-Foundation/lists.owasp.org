Q) What kind of cooperation did you get from the Indian authorities?
 
A)I have had limited interaction with the Indian authorities at this stage,
but I must say, we found the government officers that we notified of  this
very serious matter to be very professional and cooperated to the fullest
extent possible in the circumstances. My sense is that there is a real
concentration of very talented and dedicated specialists at that agency
working around the clock to protect India's critical digital infrastructure
from these sort of attacks. Moreover, we were relieved to infer or to imply
from our brief discussions that the government agency was running a parallel
investigation that was looking at closely related command and control
networks, also based in china. We very much hope that the findings from our
investigation will be of use to that agency.

&lt;/snip&gt;

 

Government of India has been deeply involved and closely investigating it.
