<PRE>This is a fairly old and ongoing effort on the part of Chinese. I am not very sure that it is supported by some official agency, but seeing the amount of effort involved and the resources available, it is hard not to believe so. During my association with the Govt the impression that I got was that while we were very much aware of these activities and the steps required to protect ourselves, but the inherent inertia in govt organisations prevented any proactive approach. 

Of the agencies chartered to protect our critical information infrastructure, the less said the better. One of these issued an advisory against Lenovo laptops bringing out a malicious executable of which the examiner knew nothing about. Google research proved the &quot;offending&quot; file to be a sound card driver !!!

Q ) What kind of cooperation did you get from the Indian authorities? 

A)I have had limited interaction with the Indian authorities at this stage, but I must say, we found the government officers that we notified of this very serious matter to be very professional and cooperated to the fullest extent possible in the circumstances. My sense is that there is a real concentration of very talented and dedicated specialists at that agency working around the clock to protect India's critical digital infrastructure from these sort of attacks. Moreover, we were relieved to infer or to imply from our brief discussions that the government agency was running a parallel investigation that was looking at closely related command and control networks, also based in china. We very much hope that the findings from our investigation will be of use to that agency. 

&lt;/snip&gt; 



Government of India has been deeply involved and closely investigating it.
