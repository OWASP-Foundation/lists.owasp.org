Hi Guys,

Thank you for your support in the last OWASP Delhi Chapter presentation. As
some of you know, I demonstrated the top ten via a tool called WebGoat. I
collected a list of other similar tools from RSnake's website. Some of you
might know these already. The websites/tools will help you test/develop your
hacking/testing skills. Good luck!

Dear All,

While testing for an XSS issue within a website. How do you be so sure that
there is no XSS within a parameter.

This is because one varient of the script will work and one will not because
of the input validation/output escaping done by the application.

How can you be so sure that u have tested all varients of the scripts.

Will u go to inject every varient of the script provided at the RSnake. Even
then how would you so sure again....

Is there any mechanism like seeing the escaping within the response that is
done by the application to know what type of escaping the application is
performing and just enhancing the scripts varients accordingly...

Please suggest......
Waiting for the reply....

Dear Parmendra

 

I would believe that the most comprehensive methods of testing an application for this issue is to use: 

1.       Multiple browsers and multiple versions of the browsers ? because some XSS variants work in the way a different browsers (and their versions) manipulate Javascript.

2.       Identify the web server and version and run a google search for whether it is vulnerable to XSS. 

3.       XSS Variants and their different avatars: You can try all types of XSS, including XSS designed to evade popular filters. escape characters, attribute based XSS (using onclick, onload,etc), evasion filter breaking like using extra spaces or splitting the script tag. 

4.       DOM based XSS testing, because it is purely client side and it you can also gain insight (in some cases where the Javascript is embedded into the html or by dumping the website files into your machine for analysis using  a HTTrack or equivalent) by having a look at the way javascript embedded in the html page. 

5.       Sometimes, in a vulnerable PHP Application, there is a situation where the application has a source code disclosure vulnerability and by using ?php$?, so you might glean some information about the input validation,etc.

 

I would recommend that an initial basic vulnerability scanner be run before doing manual pen testing. It tends to be more comprehensive. Besides, a combination of manual and automated is what is recommended. 

 

Would like to know if anyone wants to add to this.

hi All,

Wanted to report a Phishing attack which is happening as I write this email.


I have been recieving number of calls from the below numbers for the last
week or so. The caller poses as a courier service provider trying to phish
my address. Subsequent to that he tries to phish my company name and DOB.
This has been going on for the past week or so, and calls have come to my
home landline nos and my mobile no. The caller seems to know my full name
and my previous company name as well. I havent been able to trace the nos as
of now.. but any help from any one would be great.

These are the nos from which the call is coming.
911166209888
911166209666
919999887951
919999768237
919999798702

Also if you see the links below, you would notice that I am not alone. Many
folks have received similar calls. I truly believe this is a phishing
attack. it could be credit card fraud or otherwise.
Any help in tracing these nos would be of great help? the 6620 nos is
actually TATA service provider. The 9999 series is vodafone in Delhi. Any
contacts which we can use?

Any contacts in Economic Offense wing in Delhi where we can report this?

I think most of the time it is done by recovery agencies. They use the
technique of pretending as courier service to grab the address of the
defaulter and then sends court's summon or may be recovery agents. One need
not to default something to become defaulter, there have been many incidents
in the past where a mobile number/credit card/etc. is allocated to a fake
person using identification of some real person. These recovery teams are
well equipped with all internet techniques like google/social
networks/naukri.com etc. so finding the history of a well connected person
isn't a great deal. I don't see it a big problem. Let them try their fate
and if they find you, make their life miserable. Next time they ring you up,
pass on my address ;-)

Message-ID: <20090603115631.52427.qmail@f5mail-237-210.rediffmail.com>

hi OWASP Delhi,



I wish to know the steps or P.O.C to show "DOM based XSS". What are the steps to show dom based XSS ?



for example, to show reflected xs, we just enter &lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt; in a text box and click enter and we can see the script getting reflected and then executed, but how do we show DOM based XSS. Can anyone come up with simple and well defines steps to show dom based xss and it mitigation.



thanks & regards,

Suresh

If it?s escaping the script in HTML entities like &lt for < then it?s escaping it well. But don?t be sure try other variants too.

Depends..and probably yes?Not only that , I will try my libraries as well. The more variants you have the more assured you are.

Although RSnake?s cheat sheet is exhaustive but you need to test depending on the application?s environment and technology.

Sometimes <script>alert(1);</script> won?t work but ?><script>alert(1);</script> will work.

 

>>Is there any mechanism like seeing the escaping within the response that is done by the application to know what type of escaping the application is

You may try different things, for example: if application using decoding the URL encoded payloads supplied by the browser and not output escaping them after, then it might be vulnerable.

So you have to try different things. You have to be more diverse.

 

I would suggest, first run any scanner and then do manual testing. That will be comprehensive testing.

 

I think I am clear?if not kindly revert back.

Hi Parmendra,

>> You may try different things, for example: if application using decoding the URL encoded payloads supplied by the browser and not output escaping them after, then it might be >>vulnerable.So you >>have to try different things. You have to be more diverse.

It means when you supply any payload inside browser, the browser first encodes it into URLEncoded format and passes it to your application. Again your application needs to decode it using decoding functions to convert it into original form.

For example: <script>alert(1);</script> will be passed as %3cscript%3e?.format by browser to the application and application needs some URLDecode function to convert it into original format to understand it:

<script>?.</script>

Again it has to be escaped before displaying it as it is in executable format <script>?</script>.

The sample code for URL decoding and output escaping process in PHP is:

htmlspecialchars(urldecode($URL contents))

Here the URL contents are first decoded back by application and then output escaped by htmlspecialchars() function so  that it can?t gets executed.

As far as libraries is concerned it?s not more than collection of several XSS injection attack strings and variants which you collect from different resources like RSnake.

Hope it solves your query.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-delhi] Regarding XSS

 

Dear Sir,

 

Highly greatful to you for your feedback......The way you explain the problem is excellent.

 

I am confused on the last explaination which is shown below. Kindly brief it a little bit.

And you talked about using some libraries to test for XSS. May i know from where i can get those libraries.

>>Is there any mechanism like seeing the escaping within the response that is done by the application to know what type of escaping the application is 

performing and just enhancing the scripts variants accordingly...

 

You may try different things, for example: if application using decoding the URL encoded payloads supplied by the browser and not output escaping them after, then it might be vulnerable.

So you have to try different things. You have to be more diverse.

 

Thanks a lot :-)

Dear All,

I found this interesting news about ATM Malware. Interesting :) ........... 


ATM Malware Spreading Around the World
	Cash
machines around the world are hosting malware that can harvest a
person's card details for use in fraud, a situation that could worsen
as the malware becomes more sophisticated, according to a security
researcher.

Cash machines around the world are hosting malware that can harvest a
person's card details for use in fraud, a situation that could worsen
as the malware becomes more sophisticated, according to a security
researcher. Analysts at Trustwave's SpiderLabs research group were surprised earlier this year when it obtained the ATM malware sample
from a financial institution in Eastern Europe, said Andrew Henwood,
vice president of SpiderLabs's Europe, Middle East and Africa
operation. Trustwave does forensic investigations for major credit card
companies and financial institutions as well as penetration tests.
 "It's the first time we have come across malware of this type," Henwood said.
 The
malware records the magnetic stripe information on the back of a card
as well as the PIN (personal identification number). That data can be
printed out on the ATM's receipt roll when a special master card is
inserted to the ATM that launches a user interface. It can also be
recorded on the magnetic stripe of that master control card.
 "We were surprised at the level of sophistication," Henwood said. "It does make us generally pretty nervous."
 Most
ATMs run security software, but financial institutions haven't focused
on their security as much as other systems, Henwood said.
 "ATMs
were kind of an afterthought and were considered to be fairly stable,"
Henwood said. "I'd say there's not been enough focus in the past on ATM
infrastructure."
 Those who wrote the malware have detailed
knowledge about how ATMs work, Henwood said. The sample they tested ran
on ATMs using Microsoft's Windows XP operating system.
 The
sample did not have networking capabilities, but that may be a natural
evolution. That's particularly dangerous since most ATM machines in
developed countries are networked. The danger is that the malware could
be engineered into a worm that, once on one ATM, spreads through all
ATMs on a network, Henwood said.
 To install the malware, a
person would need access to inside of the ATM or a port in which
software could be uploaded. That means insiders could be involved, or
cybercriminals have picked a lock on an ATM in order to install the
software, Henwood said.
 SpiderLabs has received information that
similar malware has been found on ATMs now outside of Eastern Europe,
Henwood said. Since then, the lab has provided detailed information on
the malware to financial institutions and law enforcement, he said.
 In March, security vendor Sophos found it had captured three ATM malware samples customized to target machines made by Diebold, around the same time SpiderLabs saw its first sample.

hi OWASP Delhi,



Could anyone highlight on "XRS Cross Referer Scripting" ?



Though google is there, still someone who has shown the attack in his pen-test can give an explanation and POC.

Sorry about my reaction. Can you tell me what the attack vector is doing?

Don't get me wrong but I am quite distrustful of such emails who claim to
educate people in that way. Yes, your vector is being detected as a worm by
my Anti-virus but if its not detrimental thats ok.

Dear Gunwant

 

What is the issue with the post? The worm has been blogged about in a
similar fashion. The vector has not been exposed directly. It has been
checked for any redirection issues.

 

The purpose of identifying the vector is to let people know that a similar
string of Javascript might be embedded in their websites and webpages. It is
important that people know what the vector looks like. 

 

Do let me know if there are any Antivirus applications reacting to the post
on the blog page (which they shouldn't. I have checked for it). I will
remove the vector.

Hi Parmendra,

 

    Every variable in the program has certain amount of memory space allocated to it.  It is used to buffer data. When a very high volume of data is supplied to this particular space and there?s no input validation in application that checks for amount of data being inserted, it?s prone to buffer overflow. It can lead to some verbose errors being displayed, memory corruption or even application crashing.

For testing purpose, overwhelm the all input entries with much more volume of data and see how it is handling it.

 

As far as DOS is concerned it?s simply Denial of Service of a particular application, which becomes unaccessible to any legitimate user creating business losses. Many reasons can cause DOS like:

Buffer Overflow: Application Crashes

Automated Submission: Using any automated program/tool which can automatically submit any feedback/regisration form in the application several times causing the line to be busy and thus not usable by any legitimate user. That?s why CAPTCHAS are used.

SQL Injection: They can also create DOS. Like if the query  ?; SHUTDOWN ? is executed by the application, the database will be shutdown causing DOS.

Apart from these there may be n/w security issues too.

 

Wait for other members? comments too..

 

 

Thanks,

I think, you should not test it on production environment. It?s not recommended!

Dear sir,

Cool to see ur reply :-)

But how can you test for all of these things over a production system as it will make production system unavailable. So how do u manage without affecting the main system.

Dear Gunwant

 

The attack vector is designed to redirect a potential victim to one of the
sites configured by the bot-herder (gumblar.cn and some other sites) and
then infect the victim's system with the worm. The gumblar.cn site has been
closed by the authorities, so have some of the others, but there still might
be some more active out there. 

 

I suggest you not export the worm in a raw form. The one which I have posted
in the blog has been appropriately padded. The reason why it has been posted
is for web admins or webmasters to use it as a reference to check for any
malicious Javascript in their own webservers, etc.

 

Regards

Abhay

Sorry about my reaction. Can you tell me what the attack vector is doing?

Don't get me wrong but I am quite distrustful of such emails who claim to
educate people in that way. Yes, your vector is being detected as a worm by
my Anti-virus but if its not detrimental thats ok.

Dear Gunwant

 

What is the issue with the post? The worm has been blogged about in a
similar fashion. The vector has not been exposed directly. It has been
checked for any redirection issues.

 

The purpose of identifying the vector is to let people know that a similar
string of Javascript might be embedded in their websites and webpages. It is
important that people know what the vector looks like. 

 

Do let me know if there are any Antivirus applications reacting to the post
on the blog page (which they shouldn't. I have checked for it). I will
remove the vector.

I have written a piece on the latest malware, the Gumblar worm and why

HTTP RESPONSE SPLITTING



hi OWASP Delhi,



I am still not clear about http response splitting. 



Can anyone help me out with powerpoint presentations, easy to understand documents etc. Any test site where i could see the demo ? In real world how the attack takes place or the vulnerability is exploited ?



When a particular type of http header is used, it splits the response into two or more responses. but why it splits ? Is the problem with the web server ? 



thanks & regards,

suresh

Hi Suresh,

 

I think any proxy will do response splitting. You need to select right
parameter that will allow you to insert the attached script. Please find
attached script that will help you to do Response splitting. You need to
modify as per your requirement.

The split happens due carriage return i.e. CRLF Injection. HTTP Response
Splitting is one of the attacks originating from CRLF Injection. The other
one is Log Forging refer

This attack is not as straight forward as XSS or SQL Injection to simulate.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] FW:  [HTTP Response Splitting]
Message-ID: <B3A4B574404BA3449A74A5B78B5F2594B0F97D@sdgind015.india.sdgc.com>

Hi Suresh,

 

    An application is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting a.k.a. CRLF
injection when it doesn't validate the user input properly. 

 

For example, if requesting something like GET /myPage.asp?value=anyValue
HTTP/1.1 returns response that includes a location header and 302
response code:

HTTP/1.1 302 Found

....

....

Location: http://www.myApplication.com/myPage.asp?value=anyValue

Then it might be vulnerable. It means the application is returning the
same URL which is requested by the user in Location header.

How to exploit:

Suppose a link crafted by an attacker is clicked by a valid user. I am
crafting the script just provided by Nimisha:

 

http://www.myApplication.com/myPage.asp?value=anyValue%0d%0afoobar%0d%0a
Content-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Type:%20
text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:%2046%0d%0a%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20JSESSIONID=
9B10905435F29B9CB5B0293FAD933B06%0d%0a%0d%0a<html><script>alert("hacked"
)</script></html
<http://www.myApplication.com/myPage.asp?value=12345foobar%0d%0aContent-
Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/htm
l%0d%0aContent-Length:%2046%0d%0a%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20JSESSIONID=9B109054
35F29B9CB5B0293FAD933B06%0d%0a%0d%0a%3chtml%3e%3cscript%3ealert(%22hacke
d%22)%3c/script%3e%3c/html> >

 

It will give you response like:

HTTP/1.1 302 Found

....

....

Location: http://www.myApplication.com/myPage.asp?value=12345
<http://www.myApplication.com/myPage.asp?value=12345> 

 

foobar
//second response ; %0d is equivalent to Carriage return; %0a is
equivalent to Line feed

Content-Length: 0

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: text/html

Content-Length: 46

Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=9B10905435F29B9CB5B0293FAD933B06

<html><script>alert("hacked")</script></html>

 

You get two responses one by server and another by attacker. So this was
an example of Response splitting.

I think you might have got a bit idea.

 

Thanks,

Hi Suresh,

 

I think any proxy will do response splitting. You need to select right
parameter that will allow you to insert the attached script. Please find
attached script that will help you to do Response splitting. You need to
modify as per your requirement.

Dhruv - I had posted an analysis of the issue on my blog in May last
year. Here is the link
http://bishankochher.blogspot.com/2008/05/gmail-session-hijacking-in-7steps.html

This issue is not related to Gmail alone. I had successfully
demonstrated it for Yahoo & several other financial apps (during pen
tests I was hired for)

It is nothing new but the impact is grave considering the mobility we
live with these days.

Hello!

I wonder what would be you recommend as Open Source replacement for
Sidewinder [1] application firewall?  Important features are ease of
maintenance, ability to proxy non-HTTP/S applications, transparency to
users/applications, speed and cost.

Thanks in advance,

Well, I am sure it is on their (and several others like Yahoo) to do
list since quite sometime. Performance as we read in the article is
the major concern. It all boils down to business in the end. Many love
Gmail for it's speed. Rare are those who look into what we are looking
at. Unless there are some business feasible technological advancements
or users themselves demanding it more religiously, this is going to
take some time.

Having said that it is delighting that Google is hearing & making an
effort to see what it could do.

Cheers!
