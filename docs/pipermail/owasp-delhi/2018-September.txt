Realising the important role *cybersecurity* is going to play now and in
the future *for a safer world*, many countries are now introducing
cybersecurity education at a school level to develop interest and nurture
talent in the area.

Recently Israel
<http://www.gadgetsnow.com/tech-news/in-israel-teaching-kids-cyberskills-becomes-a-national-mission/articleshow/56971340.cms>
 and UK <http://www.bbc.com/news/education-38938519> were in the news for
offering cybersecurity education at schools.

There are many other countries that train students at the school level in
various ways. A recent NASSCOM report states that there will be a huge
shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals as much as 1.5 million jobs
will be vacant in India alone by 2019.

School students are exposed to subjects like maths, arts, programming,
sciences etc but not in the area of cybersecurity. In order to develop
interest in cybersecurity amongst school students there have been game
based learning approach via what is known as capture the flag contest or
CTF.
