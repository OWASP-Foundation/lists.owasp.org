Subject: PMI : Executive Seminar Series on Application Security

 

 

Hello Amit,

 

 

The Executive Seminar Series on Application Security is held on 22nd &amp; 29th
March 2009 (Sunday) in Delhi at Hotel Oberoi and the timings are  from 10:00
AM to 4:00 PM and it will cover everything you need to know about securing
mission-critical applications -- both the technologies you'll need, as well
as the policies and procedures you would be well advised to wrap around
them. A well-conceived application security strategy involves not only the
technology and the manner in which it is deployed - it also places an equal
emphasis on managing how that technology is used. 


Most breaches these days are coming through the application layer, so don't
miss this opportunity to hear how to best defend yourself, your organization
and your systems from application layer attacks or breaches. 


Finally, you know the value of connecting and networking with your local
peers. It's an invaluable opportunity. You'll be able to share stories and
strategies with security executives who have the same concerns, and work in
the same area. There are numerous opportunities during the day to break out
and network with your fellows.
