Yes, like how Lavakumar pointed out, Turing tests are not IP based. All CAPTCHA does it just ensure that no automated activity happens.

 

If you need to respond based on number of attempts, then CAPTCHA is not the approach. In case you are using LDAP or AD for authentication, use the features in them to protect against brute force attack by locking the user after n attempts. If it is any other data store like RDBMS database, then define it internally by yourself within the application.

 

Before answering the second question, tell us what are you having in the cookie? It would help in understanding your thought process also on what is it that made you think of cookies? Greater details is what we need.

Sameer, I dont understand what you mean by protection against 'Turing Test'. 
If you are looking at protection against automated password-guessing attacks then its pretty simple. 
The counter to display a captha or lock the account is not based on the IP or the cookie. 
It depends on the user account. 
If you get lets say five failed login attempts on a particular username then act on it, dont even bother with the IP and cookie. 

If you were looking for something else then it might help to give more details. 

Thanks and Regards,
Lavakumar K

[Owasp-delhi] Securing WAP sites

 

		




Hi All,

How would we go about securing a WAP site against turing test. There
are couple of challenges that we face.

1. We can't prompt the user with Captcha based on the number of
attempts from an IP address because many GPRS providers use a proxy.

2. Cookies? How do they help when launching a Brute Force without
submitting cookies?

Sameer
