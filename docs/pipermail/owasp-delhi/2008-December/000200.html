Few cents on the thread in general ....

 

Since last 2-3 years I keep getting a mail &quot;I vote nobody&quot; and about
&quot;49-O&quot; from lot of my friends. In last 2-3 days the frequency has
increased.

 

I would like to explain you that by doing this we are in no way doing
any better for this country. I would like to tell that this kind of mail
will go to more than say 50-60 or say 100 million people. More over all
these people are educated and from all over the country.

 

My country's problem is that the educated people do not vote and even if
they vote they vote dividedly. By spreading this kind of message and we
are making educated people's vote more irrelevant.  In every
constituency in India there is 50-60 % voter who vote, out of these
40-50% do not have email access. Hardly 10-15% will be educated email
accessing people are there in general. Giving a thought that people who
access mail and educated are in majority of what contingencies? 20-30
that's it....honestly these kind of people are not in majority even a
single contingencies as our dear politicians kept the all these things
in mind when they kept illegal Bangladeshis in our country. They kept
their calculation pretty good when they allow slums in metros. They are
also very good in making sure that all those people will have voter card
and will vote for them. 

 

Even I would see a conspiracy by some other political groups to make
educated peoples' vote invalid, because they know that this vote can go
against them.

 

So friends if we really want to do some thing Vote and Vote undividedly.
No cast No religion No rich poor. Only country. Vote for your country.
And we all know nothing is perfect in this world. Our salary is not
perfect for us. Our boss is not perfect for us. Our job is not perfect
for us. Our house is not perfect for us. Our city is not perfect for us.
What do we do? We manage and try to adjust with less problematic thing.
We choose time and time again. We select and rearrange our priority time
and time again.

 

Why we want a perfect leader or politicians. We can choose best among
them or we ourselves can go and fight an election. If you think some one
did wrong this time do not vote for him. Let's teach them a lesson. Make
sure we and our friends don't Vote for such leaders who are worth good
for nothing. Next time teach this lesson to some one else. We have to
choose less evil. And keep searching for good. Do not stop any where.
&quot;Change is definitely required&quot;. We also need to be patient. Problem
that has been created in last 20 years will not be solved in day's time
but keep trying and allow and encourage people to try.

 

Take the example of reservation, in early 90's its only V.P. Singh who
was stood for reservations for backward classes and all were against,
now every political party stand for it, because those people kept voting
undividedly for about 20 years for some one or other one.

 

Don't stop trying and voting. Neither waste your vote, because we are
dead even before blast when we stop trying and start using these kind of
&quot;49-O&quot; ......

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] 49-O in Constitution of India

 

One of my colleagues just shared this with me which i thought of
extending to everyone, this indeed can serve as a powerful medium of
expression. Just go through it :


Did you know that there is a system in our constitution, as per the 1969
act, in section &quot; 49-O&quot; that a person can go to the polling booth,
confirm his identity, get his finger marked and convey the presiding
election officer that he doesn't want to vote anyone!


Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never
disclosed it....
This is called &quot;49-O&quot;.


Why should you go and say &quot; I VOTE NOBODY&quot;... because, in a ward, if a
candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
&quot;49-O&quot; votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the
contestants will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling,
since people had already expressed their decision on them.
This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates
for their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....


Please spread this news to as many as you know...
Seems to be a wonderful weapon against corrupt parties in India ... show
your power, expressing your desire not to vote for anybody, is even more
powerful than voting.... so don't miss your chance. So either vote, or
vote not to vote (vote 49-O)


Use your voting right for a better INDIA
