&gt;<i> I believe some clarifications are in order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Firstly this &quot;Chinese attack&quot; is an ongoing and fairly old attack
</I>&gt;<i> against *all* networks of major countries.  A number of countries have
</I>&gt;<i> reported surveillance of this nature.
</I>

 +1
 is it govt sponsored?&lt;any evidence&gt;


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Right now they are concentrating their resources on gathering
</I>&gt;<i> information and disruption of networks have been reported.  However, this
</I>&gt;<i> is a minor issue as once you have gained access to a network,
</I>&gt;<i> disabling/disruption is trivial.
</I>

&gt;&gt;<i>means DOS(Denial of service)
</I>

&gt;<i> 3.  The method of gaining access is through spear phishing by sending
</I>&gt;<i> targeted emails with infected attachments.
</I>

&gt;&gt;<i>that is a old method IMO mail providers to virus check before allowing a
</I>user to download(yahoo/rediff) does i suppose.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  The source of the attack has been traced either by email headers
</I>&gt;<i> indicating servers based in China or analysis of the malware which
</I>&gt;<i> uploads/communicates with the master servers based in China.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>you mean botnet servers
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5.  Most of the times the malicious attachments have been detected by
</I>&gt;<i> antivirus at the service providers end or that installed on the host
</I>&gt;<i> machines.  Some however do pass through and then the infection spreads on
</I>&gt;<i> the internal networks through removable storage media, most popular being
</I>&gt;<i> USB Pen drives.  Some Pen Drives available at Nehru Place, New Delhi come
</I>&gt;<i> in capacities of 64 GB or even 80 GB and cost as low as Rs 500/- !!
</I>&gt;<i> Making them a most lucrative item to own or to gift.  However, without
</I>&gt;<i> exception these are manufactured in China and contain embedded malware.
</I>&gt;<i> These files are stored as hidden system files and are activated by using
</I>&gt;<i> the age-old autorun.inf method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>embedded malware?
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6.  Use of one or the other email providers has nothing to do with this
</I>&gt;<i> attack.  As has been rightly brought out, user awareness is the key.  Most
</I>&gt;<i> govt organisations have a policy of banning USB Pendrives in their
</I>&gt;<i> networks, but this policy is impractical, and therefore, rarely enforced.
</I>&gt;<i> Most user's antivirus software is rarely updated and archaic govt
</I>&gt;<i> acquisition process ensure that by the time a latest version is acquired,
</I>&gt;<i> it is already obsolete.  There is no concept of host based firewalls on
</I>&gt;<i> and even if it is installed by an aware administrator, it is disabled by
</I>&gt;<i> the user as it is &quot;too annoying&quot;.  After all, there is no patch for human
</I>&gt;<i> stupidity.
</I>&gt;<i>
