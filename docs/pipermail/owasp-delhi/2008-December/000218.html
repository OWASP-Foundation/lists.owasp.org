<PRE>Compliance to PCI-DSS or any PCI standard for that matter is driven by
 PCI SSC (PCI Security Standards Council). PCI itself is a council
composed of Visa, MasterCard, American Express etc. If there is no
incentive for PCI-DSS compliance in India (which I am not 100% sure
about) then it is because PCI-SSC is not actively enforcing it.

None of the PCI standards are legal requirements. In fact one of the
reasons the major credit card companies came together and mandated the
PCI set of standards is because they did not want the government to
step in with legislation which was inevitable in the light of the very
frequent credit card data losses taking place. The companies decided
to do it themselves since they would have more control over it and (I
like to believe) it makes more sense than the government doing it.

Compliance is just one mechanism to improve security and cannot catch
100% of the bad things out there. PCI-DSS captures some commonsense IT
best practices, it is definitely no magic dust but it is essential to
have commonsense captured in a formal manner and enforced. And PCI-DSS
like all standards have to be followed in the spirit and not just in
the letter for it to have real effect. Almost every standard I know of
can be bypassed by a company if it wanted to and still remain
compliant on paper.

By the way can anybody confirm that there is indeed no incentive in
India for merchants to be compliant to PCI-DSS?

Thanks.

Regards,
Varun

&gt;<i> Hi List,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
</I>&gt;<i> experts decide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
</I>&gt;<i> there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
</I>&gt;<i> by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
</I>&gt;<i> incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
</I>&gt;<i> now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
</I>&gt;<i> including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are your opinions on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks and regards
