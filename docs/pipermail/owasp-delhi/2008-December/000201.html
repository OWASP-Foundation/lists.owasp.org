<PRE>Hi all,

 

RULE 49-O is a Rule in the The Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, which
governs elections in India. It covers the procedures to be followed when
a valid voter decides not to cast his vote, and decides to record this
fact. Recording one's vote under Rule 49-O is a choice that voters can
exercise to prevent electoral fraud, and misuse of their vote.

 

NEGATIVE / NEUTRAL VOTING

 

The Commission has received proposals from a very large number of
individuals and organizations that there should be a provision enabling
a voter to reject all the candidates in the constituency if he does not
find them suitable. In the voting using the conventional ballot paper
and ballot boxes, an elector can drop the ballot paper without marking
his vote against any of the candidates, if he chooses so. However, in
the voting using the Electronic Voting Machines, such a facility is not
available to the voter. Although, Rule 49 O of the Conduct of Election
Rules, 1961 provides that an elector may refuse to vote after he has
been identified and necessary entries made in the Register of Electors
and the marked copy of the electoral roll, the secrecy of voting is not
protected here inasmuch as the polling officials and the polling agents
in the polling station get to know about the decision of such a voter.

 

The Commission recommends that the law should be amended to specifically
provide for negative / neutral voting. For this purpose, Rules 22 and
49B of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 may be suitably amended
adding a proviso that in the ballot paper and the particulars on the
ballot unit, in the column relating to names of candidates, after the
entry relating to the last candidate, there shall be a column '&quot;None of
the above'&quot;, to enable a voter to reject all the candidates, if he
chooses so. Such a proposal was earlier made by the Commission in 2001
(vide letter dated 10.12.2001).

 

(A petition by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties seeking such a
provision filed at the time of the recent general elections is pending
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court)

 

Please note that this request may not have been turned into a law as
yet.

 

Since the ballot paper/EVM contains only the list of candidates, a voter
cannot record his vote under Section 49-O directly. He must inform the
presiding officer at the election booth. This violates the secrecy of
the ballot. However, with paper ballot a different method is used to
&quot;waste&quot; ones vote, which is stamping on multiple candidates. In fact
this was the standard method of giving null votes without violating
secrecy before the advent of the EVM.

 

The exact implications of Rule 49-O from the perspective of winner
declaration are unclear. It may be, given the present state of The
Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, assumed that a winner will be declared
irrespective of the number of 'non-votes'. However, a note of every
'non-vote' will be made with the Election Officer, and the total number
of non-voters will, presumably, be available under the Right to
Information, Act. Please note that the availability of this information
has not been confirmed as yet.

 

 

Some recent articles and a Dedicated Website on Section 49-0 falsely
suggest that in case the number of votes recorded under Section 49-O is
greater than the maximum number of votes polled in favour of any of the
candidates, a repoll is held. However it is misleading since nothing to
this effect is mentioned either in any of the sections of The Conduct of
Elections Rules, 1961 or People's Representative Act nor can it can be
construed reading Section 49-0 in conjunction with any other Section/
Act. In fact Post terrorist Attacks on Mumbai on 26th November 2008 an
Urban Myth is being propagated through Internet that a Re-Poll will be
held in case the number of No Votes under Section 49-O is more than the
Margin of Victory.

But no doubt about that these steps will be damn good step to avoid
these stupid politicians.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] 49-O in Constitution of India

 

One of my colleagues just shared this with me which i thought of
extending to everyone, this indeed can serve as a powerful medium of
expression. Just go through it :


Did you know that there is a system in our constitution, as per the 1969
act, in section &quot; 49-O&quot; that a person can go to the polling booth,
confirm his identity, get his finger marked and convey the presiding
election officer that he doesn't want to vote anyone!


Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never
disclosed it....
This is called &quot;49-O&quot;.


Why should you go and say &quot; I VOTE NOBODY&quot;... because, in a ward, if a
candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
&quot;49-O&quot; votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the
contestants will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling,
since people had already expressed their decision on them.
This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates
for their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....


Please spread this news to as many as you know...
Seems to be a wonderful weapon against corrupt parties in India ... show
your power, expressing your desire not to vote for anybody, is even more
powerful than voting.... so don't miss your chance. So either vote, or
vote not to vote (vote 49-O)


Use your voting right for a better INDIA
