<PRE>It has nothing to do IT Act . It is Payment Card Industry Data Security standard and specific to that only.  PCIDSS is implemented worldwide and in India also it is there. It is mandatory by Visa and master so everyone who is going to use it have to comply with PCI DSS.

If we lobby in Nasscom, the amount each IT company has to spend, will be huge.

If anyone interested in the complete process (it has more than 20 components) between you swipe your card and you get a receipt, do let me know.
You will be surprised how VISA/MASTER get there share out of it.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] PCI Compliance

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta
