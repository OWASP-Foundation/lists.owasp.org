<PRE>I agree. Surprising part is that our govt. officials were using third party
mailing services (gmail) for official communication. Don't they trust their
own mailing infrastructure for availability, security or high storage? If
not, then how can they trust third party mailing from security perspective.
Along with information security as compulsory topic in institutes, I think
all our govt. officials should undergo a solid information security
awareness course to understand the risk of their small and stupid mistakes.
For sure, cyber terrorism is on its rise!

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

This is very critical issue w.r.t. national security. This is true that
government organizations lack best IT brains. There is awareness lack also
among the IT professionals on Information security. 

 

Information security should be introduced as a compulsory topic in Computers
in all institutions. We need to have strong IT research/monitoring
organization / services. There are a lot of areas in Information security
infrastructure which need stong improvements. This should be driven as a
mission critical project.

Brij Mishra
