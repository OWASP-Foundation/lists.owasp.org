<PRE>some cool attacks from 2008

Psyche-cracking
      Yeah!!! You read it right.. now hackers dont want to hack your 
accounts, steal your information.. they want to emotionally hack you? the 
Gen Next Hacks
Idea is to take input from users Blog , photo sharing, Networking site 
info and posts feed the RSS from all those sources into a dashboard and 
Then exploit the user emotions to an advantage

   Permanent denial-of-service
 Dos attack on an application and a web server ?..Script Kiddie!!!!
Its caused by Phlashing..What pDoS does is attack on firmware and if

change your hardware.

   &quot;Gecko&quot; and the building system hack
 
Gecko intercepts a user's authentication entry data, letting an attacker 
steal or clone a user's entry credentials. Gecko, which is built with a 
Programmable Intelligent Computer (PIC) chip and circuits, targets the 
Wiegand protocols used by most readers to communicate with the access 
control systems.
 
Gecko -- which sits between the scanner and back-end access control system 
-- can capture, record, replay, and even disable the user's credentials 
after they scan their card through the reader. And that's just in its 
first version

The Coolest hack tool of 2008


iPhone as a hacking tool
As the Dark reading headline says 'Bringing Sexy Back' to Hacking
Hack on the move? Errata security shipped iPhone with wireless auditing 
tools. The iPhone can collect security data on the WiFi network, such as 
whether encryption is deployed and, if so, what type, as well as detecting 
rogue access points or laptops vulnerable to WiFi-borne hacks. There's an 
SSH connection to the iPhone so they can run the tests via a command line, 
too. 
Next, the researchers may attempt WiFi fuzzing on a Nokia N810 smartphone.
