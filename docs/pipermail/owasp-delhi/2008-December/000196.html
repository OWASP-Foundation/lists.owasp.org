LETTER TO PRIMEMINISTER

 

 

Dear Mr. Prime minister 

 

I am a typical mouse from Mumbai. In the local train compartment which has
capacity of 100 persons, I travel with 500 more mouse. Mouse at least squeak
but we don't even do that. 

Today I heard your speech. In which you said 'NO BODY WOULD BE SPARED'.

I would like to remind you that fourteen years has passed since serial bomb
blast in Mumbai took place. Dawood was the main conspirator. Till today he
is not caught. All our bolywood actors, our builders, our Gutka king meets
him but your Government can not catch him. Reason is simple; all your
ministers are hand in glove with him. If any attempt is made to catch him
everybody will be exposed. Your statement 'NOBODY WOULD BE SPARED' is
nothing but a cruel joke on this unfortunate people of India .... 

Enough is enough. As such after seeing terrorist attack carried out by about
a dozen young boys I realize that if same thing continues days are not away
when terrorist will attack by air, destroy our nuclear reactor and there
will be one more Hiroshima . 

 

We the people are left with only one mantra. Womb to Bomb to Tomb. You
promised Mumbaikar Shanghai what you have given us is Jalianwala Baug. 

Today only your home minister resigned. What took you so long to kick out
this joker? Only reason was that he was loyal to Gandhi family.

Loyalty to Gandhi family is more important than blood of innocent people,
isn't it? 

I am born and bought up in Mumbai for last fifty eight years. Believe me
corruption in Maharashtra is worse than that in Bihar . Look at all the
politician, Sharad Pawar, Chagan Bhujbal, Narayan Rane, Bal Thackray ,
Gopinath Munde, Raj Thackray, Vilasrao Deshmukh all are rolling in money.
Vilasrao Deshmukh is one of the worst Chief minister I have seen.

His only business is to increase the FSI every other day, make money and
send it to Delhi so Congress can fight next election. Now the clown has
found new way and will increase FSI for fisherman so they can build concrete
house right on sea shore. Next time terrorist can comfortably live in those
house , enjoy the beauty of sea and then attack the Mumbai at their will. 

Recently I had to purchase house in Mumbai. I met about two dozen builders.
Everybody wanted about 30% in black. A common person like me knows this and
with all your intelligent agency &amp; CBI you and your finance minister are not
aware of it. Where all the black money goes? To the underworld isn't it? Our
politicians take help of these goondas to vacate people by force. I myself
was victim of it. If you have time please come to me, I will tell you
everything. 

If this has been land of fools, idiots then I would not have ever cared to
write you this letter. Just see the tragedy, on one side we are reaching
moon, people are so intelligent and on other side you politician has
converted nectar into deadly poison. I am everything Hindu, Muslim,
Christian, Schedule caste, OBC, Muslim OBC, Christian Schedule caste, Creamy
Schedule caste only what I am not is INDIAN. You politician have raped every
part of mother India by your policy of divide and rule. 

Take example of former president Abdul Kalam. Such a intelligent person,
such a fine human being. You politician didn't even spare him. Your party
along with opposition joined the hands, because politician feels they are
supreme and there is no place for good person. 

Dear Mr Prime minister you are one of the most intelligent person, most
learned person. Just wake up, be a real SARDAR. First and foremost expose
all selfish politician. Ask Swiss bank to give name of all Indian account
holder. Give reins of CBI to independent agency. Let them find wolf among
us. There will be political upheaval but that will better than dance of
death which we are witnessing every day. Just give us ambient where we can
work honestly and without fear. Let there be rule of law. Everything else
will be taken care of. 

Choice is yours Mr. Prime Minister. Do you want to be lead by one person or
you want to lead the nation of 100 Crore people?
