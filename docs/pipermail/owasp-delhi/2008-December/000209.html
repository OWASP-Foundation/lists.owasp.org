<PRE>Few funny posts about PCI DSS from Jeremiah's Blog:

I found that PCI requirements for companies around here are raised by their
overseas partners to have their development team trained and get their
application PCI compliant. To be specific, with growing rate of our offshore
industry we are in high need of compliance and regulatory body. And
compliance doesn't mean ISO, PCI or SOX rather should be a new compliance
applicable to Indian Industry in terms of affordability and controls
relevant to Indian industry. In India, compliance means a certificate that
can be well framed and hanged at reception area so that visitors can say
&quot;wow!&quot;

For sure, PCI is needed for debit/credit card vendors but rest of the
software development industry should be kept at equal leverage and there
should be a strong regulatory body to do anytime audit rather annual or one
time audits so that companies clean and read the hanged certificate frame on
daily basis :-) I had a short conversation with NASSCOM officials last week
and I raised the same concern. It seems that they are equally aware about
the seriousness of this matter but forming a new compliance is like burning
the midnight oil. I personally don't see PCI to be 100% effective
compliance. Read out their 6.5 clause that follows OWASP top 10 and you may
find dozens of scanning tools on the wild those claim that their reports are
PCI compliant. Which means, if a tool has detected 10 XSS, 5 SQL injections
and skipped 50 other XSS along with 20 more SQL injection flaws it will
still claim the report to be PCI compliant. Controls can be built,
compliance can be achieved but till the time company itself is not serious
about the security of its resources, such effort is only going to result in
a frame at the reception and a big banner &quot;PCI CERTIFIED&quot; on the website.
Remember HackerSafe?

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta
