<PRE>Dear All,

 

Thank you for your participation in OWASP November meeting held at TCS Noida
facilities on 29th November 2008. We are thankful to TCS for helping us out
in organizing this meeting at their premises. In case, your company would
also like to sponsor venue and refreshment for upcoming meetings then kindly
let us know. Event page with meeting presentations has been archived at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Delhi_Meeting_November_29th_2008">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Delhi_Meeting_November_29th_2008</A> 

 

As we announced in the meeting, we have formed two OWASP Delhi committees
namely Communication Committee &amp; Events Committee. Join me to welcome
Saurabh Rai and Nitin Saxena for their volunteer nomination to OWASP Delhi
Committees. Saurabh works as BDM for Torrid Networks (P) Ltd.
(www.torridnet.com &lt;<A HREF="http://www.torridnet.com/">http://www.torridnet.com/</A>&gt; ) and has been nominated as
Lead - OWASP Delhi Communication Committee. You may reach him at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-delhi">saurabh.rai at torridnet.com.</A> As you might be already aware, our old friend
Nitin Saxena is associated with CyberMedia Events (www.cybermediaevents.com)
as Sr. Project Manager and has been nominated as Lead - OWASP Delhi Events
Committee. You may reach Nitin at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-delhi">nitins at cybermedia.co.in.</A> 

 

Your volunteer participation is highly needed to bring further application
security awareness into Indian industry. We need volunteers for OWASP Delhi
AppSec Research Committee. In case, you would like to work on some AppSec
research project then kindly nominate yourself to get associated with this
committee. 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

OWASP Delhi Board
