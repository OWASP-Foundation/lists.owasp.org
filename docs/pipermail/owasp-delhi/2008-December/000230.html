<PRE>I believe some clarifications are in order.

1.  Firstly this &quot;Chinese attack&quot; is an ongoing and fairly old attack
against *all* networks of major countries.  A number of countries have
reported surveillance of this nature.

2.  Right now they are concentrating their resources on gathering
information and disruption of networks have been reported.  However, this
is a minor issue as once you have gained access to a network,
disabling/disruption is trivial.

3.  The method of gaining access is through spear phishing by sending
targeted emails with infected attachments.

4.  The source of the attack has been traced either by email headers
indicating servers based in China or analysis of the malware which
uploads/communicates with the master servers based in China.

5.  Most of the times the malicious attachments have been detected by
antivirus at the service providers end or that installed on the host
machines.  Some however do pass through and then the infection spreads on
the internal networks through removable storage media, most popular being
USB Pen drives.  Some Pen Drives available at Nehru Place, New Delhi come
in capacities of 64 GB or even 80 GB and cost as low as Rs 500/- !! 
Making them a most lucrative item to own or to gift.  However, without
exception these are manufactured in China and contain embedded malware. 
These files are stored as hidden system files and are activated by using
the age-old autorun.inf method.

6.  Use of one or the other email providers has nothing to do with this
attack.  As has been rightly brought out, user awareness is the key.  Most
govt organisations have a policy of banning USB Pendrives in their
networks, but this policy is impractical, and therefore, rarely enforced. 
Most user's antivirus software is rarely updated and archaic govt
acquisition process ensure that by the time a latest version is acquired,
it is already obsolete.  There is no concept of host based firewalls on
and even if it is installed by an aware administrator, it is disabled by
the user as it is &quot;too annoying&quot;.  After all, there is no patch for human
stupidity.
