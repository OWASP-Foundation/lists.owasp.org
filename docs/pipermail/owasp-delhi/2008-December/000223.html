<PRE>Pay specific effort to evaluate how key management and encrypted data 
access are designed in the application architecture.

Can an external attacker transparently decrypt data without needing the 
key at all? Web applications might (highly possible) have functionality 
that allows for transparent encryption and decryption of data. Remember to 
evaluate how such transparent crypto functionality might stand up to 
common web application attacks. Will a successful [SQL|HTML] injection 
attack, return lots of unencrypted data because of crypto transparency? 
This scenario will be a very common one. But we have to assess how 
resilient the security architecture is, if there happens to be just one 
page with SQL Injection vulnerability in the future.

How resilient is the architecture towards internal attackers? How good 
would the encryption and key management be if we were to assume that a 
compromised laptop is plugged into the same network?

&gt;<i> the consultants you hire have the right skills for the job, else you 
</I>might fail the certifying audit. 
&gt;<i> If the certifying auditor himself turns out to be a non-techie then God 
</I>save our money ;)
Thats a good point. In addition to tech skills, I would always recommend 
consultants who would approach the application as an adversary would. Dont 
hire a consultant who cant get his objective right. The PCI consultant's 
goal should not be evaluating whether the PCI Compliance certificate can 
hang in the auditee's reception. The goal should be to assess if the 
application design and implementation have any vulnerabilities that can 
lead to personally identifiable data.
 
Check out the consultant's approach to PCI audits. If it is mostly a 
checklist based one, with very little areas where the attacker thinks like 
an adversary, the results might affect only the auditee's reception :-)

Just my 2 cents. YMMV.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-delhi] PCI Compliance
 

PCI is not perfect but it greatly helps in protecting data. 

I have done a PCI compliance check for one of my old clients. 
My focus was on their applications, PCI is good in lot of areas like the 
emphasis on the encryption strength used, data storage security, sensitive 
data retenion or rather lack of it, Secure SDLC etc. 
But then there are some not so good areas, like its gives an option 
between doing a Pentration Testing of the application or using a WAF 
instead. 
Eventually it all comes down to the technical capability of the auditor, 
most auditors dont understand crypto and programming concepts. 
There were instances in the audit where the developers tried to take me 
for a ride, had it not been for my programming background I would have 
missed out so many areas of concern. 
A good friend of mine, who is also an auditor for PCI told me about an 
instance where the developer was using ROT-13 mixed with some more kiddie 
ideas for data storage and claimed his 'encryption' meet PCI standards, my 
friend was an ex-java dev so he spotted it. 

Moral of the story, if you are checking yourself for PCI compliance then 
make sure the consultants you hire have the right skills for the job, else 
you might fail the certifying audit. 
If the certifying auditor himself turns out to be a non-techie then God 
save our money ;)

I think certifying an application for being fully secured will remain 
tricky and if at all there is any such certifying body, then trusting its 
credibility would be difficult. Most of the service providers and 
compliance like PCI refer to OWASP Top Ten. For me, a certificate to web 
application can only suggest the attacks/checks performed in reference to 
OWASP, WASC or a custom list against the application, but certifying the 
application as fully secured to a customer will always be tough. That is 
the reason ?HackerSafe certified website program? was able to attract 
large customer base initially but could never stay effective even after 
its acquisition by Mcafee:

As rightly said ? the PCI DSS standard is for credit card data protection. 
It is mandated by the Card industry which founded the standards. 
Compliance is necessary by any entity processing, storing or transmitting 
credit card info. However, the nature of audit depends on the volume of 
transaction. 6 million records and above have to go in for an onsite 
audit. Less than that ? a self assessment questionnaire needs to be filled 
up and vetted and sent as compliance to PCI DSS. As far as I know, there 
is no merchant or service provider in India who meet the requirement for 
an onsite audit. 
  
Talking of standards ? are there any standards for application security 
against which they can be certified. Common Criteria is one but scope of 
CC is much wider. Any ideas?

Monika Lal

Subject: Re: [Owasp-delhi] PCI Compliance 
 
PCI DSS is a standard which was founded by visa, mastercard, am ex among 
others. its purely a standard for protecting credit card data. I dont 
think it would be prudent to have PCI DSS included in IT act or for that 
matter including any standard in the IT act. Laws can not be goverened by 
standard run by private intitutions. However since credit cards in india 
can only be issued by banks, RBI can issue guidelines to banks to adhere 
to a set acceptable standard. it could be PCI DSS or any other.

The PCI security Standard council, has fixed standard on who should 
undergo certification under PCI DSS. As per my last understanding, any one 
processing, storing, transmitting more than 6 million records annually 
needs to have certification done. So merchants such as Shoppers Stop would 
come in close. Banks such as SBI, ICICI and Citi would also fall under 
this category. however adherance to this guidelines seems to be low. not 
sure why. Since the certification is purely govered by this private 
institution, it seems they have some exception process. 

Hope this is helpful

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta
