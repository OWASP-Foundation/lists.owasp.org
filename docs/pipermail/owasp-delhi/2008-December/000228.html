<PRE>Not only OWASP India but OWASP Global chapters are eager to help government
bodies. I and Puneet proposed and were chairing the working session on
&quot;OWASP Intra Government Affairs&quot; at OWASP EU Summit last month. We also
prepared a detailed presentation on it but unfortunately, couldn't
participate in this session which was well taken care by David Campbell.
Here is the link for the objective of that session:

tal_Affairs

 

We met a top decision making government official (I don't want to name
publicly) in this space some time back to propose such initiative, we also
keep sending personal invitations to govt. officials to participate in free
and open OWASP monthly meetings so that atleast we get a chance of
explaining and exploring such avenues, but then who cares! You know how it
goes here.

 

Post me offline if any one has got a wake-up bell for our govt. officials,
probably it might work with your suggestions.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

OWASP (All India chapters ) should pro-actively work with govt IT
organizations like NIC and all to develop awareness on Info Security at
lower level. OWASP (All India chapters) should work very closely with such
governing bodies for better IT Info &amp; Infrastructure security management and
control as this cyber terrorism may lead to:

1. Financial attacks on banking &amp; investment sites

2. National security strategy leak

3. Critical information leak

 

OWASP (All India Chapters) should present its plan and Infoemation security
concern to these Irresponsible Government bodies. I strongly believe that
our government need monthly public assessment on various areas to improve
its functioning.

I agree. Surprising part is that our govt. officials were using third party
mailing services (gmail) for official communication. Don't they trust their
own mailing infrastructure for availability, security or high storage? If
not, then how can they trust third party mailing from security perspective.
Along with information security as compulsory topic in institutes, I think
all our govt. officials should undergo a solid information security
awareness course to understand the risk of their small and stupid mistakes.
For sure, cyber terrorism is on its rise!

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

This is very critical issue w.r.t. national security. This is true that
government organizations lack best IT brains. There is awareness lack also
among the IT professionals on Information security. 

 

Information security should be introduced as a compulsory topic in Computers
in all institutions. We need to have strong IT research/monitoring
organization / services. There are a lot of areas in Information security
infrastructure which need stong improvements. This should be driven as a
mission critical project.
