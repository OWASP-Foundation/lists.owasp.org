<PRE>
OWASP (All India chapters ) should pro-actively work with govt IT
organizations like NIC and all to develop awareness on Info Security at
lower level. OWASP (All India chapters) should work very closely with
such governing bodies for better IT Info &amp; Infrastructure security
management and control as this cyber terrorism may lead to:
1. Financial attacks on banking &amp; investment sites
2. National security strategy leak
3. Critical information leak
 
OWASP (All India Chapters) should present its plan and Infoemation
security concern to these Irresponsible Government bodies. I strongly
believe that our government need monthly public assessment on various
areas to improve its functioning.

I agree. Surprising part is that our govt. officials were using third
party mailing services (gmail) for official communication. Don't they
trust their own mailing infrastructure for availability, security or
high storage? If not, then how can they trust third party mailing from
security perspective. Along with information security as compulsory
topic in institutes, I think all our govt. officials should undergo a
solid information security awareness course to understand the risk of
their small and stupid mistakes. For sure, cyber terrorism is on its
rise!

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

This is very critical issue w.r.t. national security. This is true that
government organizations lack best IT brains. There is awareness lack
also among the IT professionals on Information security. 

 

Information security should be introduced as a compulsory topic in
Computers in all institutions. We need to have strong IT
research/monitoring organization / services. There are a lot of areas in
Information security infrastructure which need stong improvements. This
should be driven as a mission critical project.

Brij Mishra
