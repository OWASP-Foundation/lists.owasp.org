</I>&gt;<i> I am in 100% agreement with Nalin. This way we will be losing our own Money
</I>&gt;<i> and time. Even if one batch is disqualified who knows the other one is not
</I>&gt;<i> same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All are same so by just avoiding vote or doing it using &quot;49-O&quot; is not going
</I>&gt;<i> to harm these politicians. They will remain same but will lose more public
</I>&gt;<i> money and time. We should try to fight altogether and try to get best leader
</I>&gt;<i> at the Top.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the failure of system so we need to make our system more strong. At
</I>&gt;<i> present we should force these leaders to make strong laws so that cases
</I>&gt;<i> against Terrorists do not take long time to complete. There should be
</I>&gt;<i> provision for toughest punishments for these people

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Few cents on the thread in general &#8230;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since last 2-3 years I keep getting a mail &quot;I vote nobody&quot; and about &quot;49-O&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> from lot of my friends. In last 2-3 days the frequency has increased.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to explain you that by doing this we are in no way doing any
</I>&gt;<i> better for this country. I would like to tell that this kind of mail will go
</I>&gt;<i> to more than say 50-60 or say 100 million people. More over all these people
</I>&gt;<i> are educated and from all over the country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My country's problem is that the educated people do not vote and even if
</I>&gt;<i> they vote they vote dividedly. By spreading this kind of message and we are
</I>&gt;<i> making educated people's vote more irrelevant.  In every constituency in
</I>&gt;<i> India there is 50-60 % voter who vote, out of these 40-50% do not have email
</I>&gt;<i> access. Hardly 10-15% will be educated email accessing people are there in
</I>&gt;<i> general. Giving a thought that people who access mail and educated are in
</I>&gt;<i> majority of what contingencies? 20-30 that's it&#8230;.honestly these kind of
</I>&gt;<i> people are not in majority even a single contingencies as our dear
</I>&gt;<i> politicians kept the all these things in mind when they kept illegal
</I>&gt;<i> Bangladeshis in our country. They kept their calculation pretty good when
</I>&gt;<i> they allow slums in metros. They are also very good in making sure that all
</I>&gt;<i> those people will have voter card and will vote for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even I would see a conspiracy by some other political groups to make
</I>&gt;<i> educated peoples' vote invalid, because they know that this vote can go
</I>&gt;<i> against them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So friends if we really want to do some thing Vote and Vote undividedly. No
</I>&gt;<i> cast No religion No rich poor. Only country. Vote for your country. And we
</I>&gt;<i> all know nothing is perfect in this world. Our salary is not perfect for us.
</I>&gt;<i> Our boss is not perfect for us. Our job is not perfect for us. Our house is
</I>&gt;<i> not perfect for us. Our city is not perfect for us. What do we do? We manage
</I>&gt;<i> and try to adjust with less problematic thing. We choose time and time
</I>&gt;<i> again. We select and rearrange our priority time and time again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why we want a perfect leader or politicians. We can choose best among them
</I>&gt;<i> or we ourselves can go and fight an election. If you think some one did
</I>&gt;<i> wrong this time do not vote for him. Let's teach them a lesson. Make sure we
</I>&gt;<i> and our friends don't Vote for such leaders who are worth good for nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> Next time teach this lesson to some one else. We have to choose less evil.
</I>&gt;<i> And keep searching for good. Do not stop any where. &quot;Change is definitely
</I>&gt;<i> required&quot;. We also need to be patient. Problem that has been created in last
</I>&gt;<i> 20 years will not be solved in day's time but keep trying and allow and
</I>&gt;<i> encourage people to try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take the example of reservation, in early 90's its only V.P. Singh who was
</I>&gt;<i> stood for reservations for backward classes and all were against, now every
</I>&gt;<i> political party stand for it, because those people kept voting undividedly
</I>&gt;<i> for about 20 years for some one or other one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't stop trying and voting. Neither waste your vote, because we are dead
</I>&gt;<i> even before blast when we stop trying and start using these kind of &quot;49-O&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &#8230;&#8230;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of my colleagues just shared this with me which i thought of extending
</I>&gt;<i> to everyone, this indeed can serve as a powerful medium of expression. Just
</I>&gt;<i> go through it :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you know that there is a system in our constitution, as per the 1969
</I>&gt;<i> act, in section &quot; 49-O&quot; that a person can go to the polling booth, confirm
</I>&gt;<i> his identity, get his finger marked and convey the presiding election
</I>&gt;<i> officer that he doesn't want to vote anyone!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never
</I>&gt;<i> disclosed it....
</I>&gt;<i> This is called &quot;49-O&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why should you go and say &quot; I VOTE NOBODY&quot;... because, in a ward, if a
</I>&gt;<i> candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;49-O&quot; votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
</I>&gt;<i> have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the contestants
</I>&gt;<i> will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling, since people had
</I>&gt;<i> already expressed their decision on them.
</I>&gt;<i> This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates
</I>&gt;<i> for their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
</I>&gt;<i> political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
</I>&gt;<i> commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please spread this news to as many as you know...
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to be a wonderful weapon against corrupt parties in India ... show
</I>&gt;<i> your power, expressing your desire not to vote for anybody, is even more
</I>&gt;<i> powerful than voting.... so don't miss your chance. So either vote, or vote
</I>&gt;<i> not to vote (vote 49-O)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use your voting right for a better INDIA
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
