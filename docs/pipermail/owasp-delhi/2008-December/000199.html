There is no section 49-O in the constitution of India. This is part of
The Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961. See

</I>&gt;<i> Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never

</I>&gt;<i> This is called &quot;49-O&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why should you go and say &quot; I VOTE NOBODY&quot;... because, in a ward, if a
</I>&gt;<i> candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;49-O&quot; votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
</I>&gt;<i> have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the contestants
</I>&gt;<i> will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling, since people had
</I>&gt;<i> already expressed their decision on them.
</I>&gt;<i> This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates for
</I>&gt;<i> their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
</I>&gt;<i> political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
</I>&gt;<i> commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please spread this news to as many as you know...
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to be a wonderful weapon against corrupt parties in India ... show
</I>&gt;<i> your power, expressing your desire not to vote for anybody, is even more
</I>&gt;<i> powerful than voting.... so don't miss your chance. So either vote, or vote
</I>&gt;<i> not to vote (vote 49-O)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use your voting right for a better INDIA
