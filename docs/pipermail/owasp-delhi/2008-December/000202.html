<PRE>Hi All,


    Also...the this is high time we must stop divisive politics of any
sort...based on community,religion, caste, region, language...to fight the
evil of terrorism.


We have to remain united in this time!

Nilesh

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> India has been on the LeT forces target for quite some time. The terrorist

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dhruv,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have different opinion on this. Politicians are responsible but
</I>&gt;<i> Governments are primarily responsible for this.  Our politicians are not at
</I>&gt;<i> all smart to drive INDIA on world map.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is the team who are members of government i.e. IAS, IPS, and other
</I>&gt;<i> government officials are having prime responsibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me put evidence for these points &#8211; &quot;RAW, IB, MUMBAI POLICE &amp; other
</I>&gt;<i> security agencies chief and officers should counter each other on not acting
</I>&gt;<i> upon the information. Media should also respond in positive direction like
</I>&gt;<i> should ask Defense minister to public the report on the action taken on
</I>&gt;<i> Information provided by various security agencies related to this BRUTAL
</I>&gt;<i> ATTACK.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel corruption is the ROOT CAUSE of these attacks. Impact of corruption
</I>&gt;<i> and its link of attack is as below:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Politician needs money to fight election.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Commissioned &amp; other officers need money for better lifestyle &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> recognition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Rich people want to rule world utilizing money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Poor / Unemployed people need money for food and life and they become
</I>&gt;<i> prime target of such opportunities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No one can remove corruption. But yes physical security can be improved to
</I>&gt;<i> have zero-effect of such attacks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My ROOT suggestions for PHYSICAL SECURITY are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.      Install scanners on all public places instead of CCTV. These
</I>&gt;<i> scanners should automatically send the signal / mail to all local, state
</I>&gt;<i> level and central security agencies along with place and pictures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.      These scanners should be governed by Army police.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.      Defense Ministry should respond on these signal using different
</I>&gt;<i> mediums newspaper, websites etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.      There should be one Security Index like BSE, NIFTY which will
</I>&gt;<i> present the exact value of security measures and effectiveness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Media and other Intellectual society should present a plan to government on
</I>&gt;<i> how we can improve this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our scientists should demand fund for and develop such scanners.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a lot of things which makes us (INDIA) vulnerable. We have to
</I>&gt;<i> start from somewhere. Only blaming is not the solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Dear All
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 100% in agreement with Dhruv, Tarun and Pravin. All these politicians are
</I>&gt;<i> not eligible for the job so they should be thrown out of the offices which
</I>&gt;<i> ever portfolio they are holding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They don't have a shame on their faces even after such a horrified attack.
</I>&gt;<i> Our so called hon'able home minister of Maharashtra is saying that &quot; This
</I>&gt;<i> all happens in big cities&quot; then why not he went to Taj or Trident and faced
</I>&gt;<i> the bullets, why he was hiding at that time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should pery to GOD some time these terrorists should some and strike in
</I>&gt;<i> these politicians house.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its shame on all of us also why we choose these as our leaders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For every citizen killed in this attack, equal number of these politicians
</I>&gt;<i> should be put in jail for not doing their duty honestly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would prey from GOD to save all of us from these currupt politicians and
</I>&gt;<i> give us some honest leader who can rule this country with honesty.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
</I>&gt;<i> here with believe that you guys won&#162;t mind it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indian politicians are taking the civilians for granted and are very much
</I>&gt;<i> centric at their personal interests rather caring about interest of the
</I>&gt;<i> country. They are good at making unrealistic statements in media but no
</I>&gt;<i> action at all. I was in Delhi at the time of this attack on nation, but this
</I>&gt;<i> particular incident has really disturbed my deep feelings for my nation and
</I>&gt;<i> is giving so disheartening feeling of being an impotent and coward Indian
</I>&gt;<i> who can be killed anytime on the roads or in the suite of a 7 star hotel. No
</I>&gt;<i> one can enter and open up fire just like that in my home! I am 10000% sure,
</I>&gt;<i> the current heat will go on for few more days in Media and politicians will
</I>&gt;<i> be under pressure. But when it will come to action, it will be all hollow.
</I>&gt;<i> Honorable prime minister has blamed Pakistan for this, which is so lame and
</I>&gt;<i> highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can come from any part of the
</I>&gt;<i> world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are just terrorists. Who
</I>&gt;<i> cares, if they were trained in Pakistan or in America ? Point is, are we
</I>&gt;<i> fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border security and then
</I>&gt;<i> internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off their hands
</I>&gt;<i> by blaming any other country and must understand that &quot;We are weak from
</I>&gt;<i> inside-out&quot;. Look at United States , one attack and they just declared
</I>&gt;<i> openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy it! But wow!
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome to India ! We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation
</I>&gt;<i> for OBCs, Marathas rule Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don&#162;t
</I>&gt;<i> care about the life of those OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in
</I>&gt;<i> our country. I won't be surprised to see another attack in next few months
</I>&gt;<i> in Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it. It can just happen to anyone,
</I>&gt;<i> except politicians! And they know it very well that they are always going to
</I>&gt;<i> be safe due to high personal security. I don't see any GOD for these people
</I>&gt;<i> who just don't perform their duties for which they were elected by the
</I>&gt;<i> civilians.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for
</I>&gt;<i> terrorists, coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a
</I>&gt;<i> miserable life. There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people.
</I>&gt;<i> Cut down their sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them
</I>&gt;<i> live a miserable life in their own country. I am so angry on the way
</I>&gt;<i> politicians of my country operate and couldn&#162;t really sleep from last 3 days
</I>&gt;<i> or concentrate on my work. May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to
</I>&gt;<i> take birth in the country that is always operated by incompetent and
</I>&gt;<i> impotent politicians! Probably, our politicians were never fed with their
</I>&gt;<i> mother's breast milk and must have been fed by some bitches on the street!
</I>&gt;<i> That is why they have no love for their nation!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
</I>&gt;<i> single solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
</I>&gt;<i> politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can
</I>&gt;<i> bring a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will,
</I>&gt;<i> but I feel they might) act on terrorism then...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dhruv
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -------
</I>&gt;<i> If you meet any Indian politician, ask him to kill me. I don't want a death
</I>&gt;<i> from some terrorist in my own country!!!
