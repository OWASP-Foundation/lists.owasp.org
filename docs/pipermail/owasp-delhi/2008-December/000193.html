<PRE>Hi Jitesh,

 

I am also in touch with couple of local and overseas friends of mine and
were exploring some idea on starting some independent intelligence group.
But I just heard that Zee TV has got 1500 volunteers who would be
participating in similar nation wide movement.  

 

I am marking this email to OWASP Mumbai to establish a bridge between common
communities. I am not sure but still hope and pray to GOD that our
colleagues from Mumbai are safe at home.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Agree with the general thoughts that are being discussed. My fear is, with
all the emotional response pouring in, we might loose sight of the real
issue here and more importantly this might all fizz out in a while like so
many other incidents in the past.

Those who died on 26/11 in Mumbai and during all the previous terrorist
attacks are not just the victims of a bullet or a blast. They are a victim
of a system, plagued with inept people who are in power and with countrymen
who will do the talk but not walk the walk. It is a shame. To a certain
degree, we are all to blame as we are responsible for making our country
what it is today.

I agree with Druv, we as a country lack leaders who can inspire with words
and follow through with actions. Corruption is a part of the problem, not
the only problem.

Terrorism is a part of life in today's world. Given its nature, no country
can stop it but as pointed out, we need to be prepared for it. Here, in some
sense, philosophically, you can draw a parallel between terrorism and
application security (or insecurity).

We were unprepared, we are unprepared. We always knew it but were hoping
that we might be lucky and noone would notice us. 

We are a democracy where people are taken for granted and a part of the
problem is that we, the people, have always accepted it as how things will
always be. We fume for a , blame each other, at best &quot;discuss ideas&quot; and
then move on with our own indivisual busy lives.

I'm not going to mention everything that is wrong with our country but
instead make an appeal that we, the people, need to come together and act,
and act now. It is only the educated youth of this country, the common man
who can bring in the change that we all wish to see. Let us not get bogged
down by the system and the inept leaders we have. 

I and a few friends of mine are willing to volunteer and help in our limited
capacity if someone is aware of a &quot;meaningful&quot; movement or platform that is
out there. 

(Not sure if Dharmesh (OWASP Mumbai) hangs out here, but would be worthwhile
to float this in the Mumbai community as well)

It is time to act, lets start with a step.

thanks,
-Jitesh Kamat

But I don&#146;t. Teams are driven by leaders. If leader will go to sleep, he
won&#146;t find productivity from the team. It starts from Prime Minister to Home
Minister to Intelligence Agencies to other officials, etc. But we don&#146;t have
a deserving leader anywhere in the system. Leader should be demanding,
motivating, decision-making, aggressive, dynamic and lot more than this.
Leaders can&#146;t work without capable teams and vice-versa. But our leader
would look good for  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.santabanta.com/">http://www.santabanta.com/</A>&gt; www.santabanta.com and not
as a national leader
..These guys are now turned to be beggars in-front of
Pakistan &#147;please provide us all the listed terrorists, we can never catch
them ourselves!&#148;

Dhruv,

 

I have different opinion on this. Politicians are responsible but
Governments are primarily responsible for this.  Our politicians are not at
all smart to drive INDIA on world map.

 

It is the team who are members of government i.e. IAS, IPS, and other
government officials are having prime responsibility.

 

Let me put evidence for these points &#150; &#147;RAW, IB, MUMBAI POLICE &amp; other
security agencies chief and officers should counter each other on not acting
upon the information. Media should also respond in positive direction like
should ask Defense minister to public the report on the action taken on
Information provided by various security agencies related to this BRUTAL
ATTACK.&#148;

 

I feel corruption is the ROOT CAUSE of these attacks. Impact of corruption
and its link of attack is as below:

1. Politician needs money to fight election.

2. Commissioned &amp; other officers need money for better lifestyle &amp;
recognition.

3. Rich people want to rule world utilizing money.

4. Poor / Unemployed people need money for food and life and they become
prime target of such opportunities.

 

No one can remove corruption. But yes physical security can be improved to
have zero-effect of such attacks.

 

My ROOT suggestions for PHYSICAL SECURITY are:

1.      Install scanners on all public places instead of CCTV. These
scanners should automatically send the signal / mail to all local, state
level and central security agencies along with place and pictures.

2.      These scanners should be governed by Army police. 

3.      Defense Ministry should respond on these signal using different
mediums newspaper, websites etc.

4.      There should be one Security Index like BSE, NIFTY which will
present the exact value of security measures and effectiveness.

 

Media and other Intellectual society should present a plan to government on
how we can improve this.

 

Our scientists should demand fund for and develop such scanners.

 

There are a lot of things which makes us ( INDIA ) vulnerable. We have to
start from somewhere. Only blaming is not the solution. 

 

 

Regards,

Brij

Dear All

 

100% in agreement with Dhruv, Tarun and Pravin. All these politicians are
not eligible for the job so they should be thrown out of the offices which
ever portfolio they are holding.

 

They don't have a shame on their faces even after such a horrified attack.
Our so called hon'able home minister of Maharashtra is saying that &quot; This
all happens in big cities&quot; then why not he went to Taj or Trident and faced
the bullets, why he was hiding at that time.

 

We should pery to GOD some time these terrorists should some and strike in
these politicians house. 

 

Its shame on all of us also why we choose these as our leaders.

 

For every citizen killed in this attack, equal number of these politicians
should be put in jail for not doing their duty honestly.

 

I would prey from GOD to save all of us from these currupt politicians and
give us some honest leader who can rule this country with honesty.

 

Deepak Gupta

I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
here with believe that you guys won&#162;t mind it!

 

Indian politicians are taking the civilians for granted and are very much
centric at their personal interests rather caring about interest of the
country. They are good at making unrealistic statements in media but no
action at all. I was in Delhi at the time of this attack on nation, but this
particular incident has really disturbed my deep feelings for my nation and
is giving so disheartening feeling of being an impotent and coward Indian
who can be killed anytime on the roads or in the suite of a 7 star hotel. No
one can enter and open up fire just like that in my home! I am 10000% sure,
the current heat will go on for few more days in Media and politicians will
be under pressure. But when it will come to action, it will be all hollow.
Honorable prime minister has blamed Pakistan for this, which is so lame and
highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can come from any part of the
world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are just terrorists. Who
cares, if they were trained in Pakistan or in America ? Point is, are we
fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border security and then
internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong
intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off their hands
by blaming any other country and must understand that &quot;We are weak from
inside-out&quot;. Look at United States , one attack and they just declared
openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy it! But wow!
Welcome to India ! We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation
for OBCs, Marathas rule Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don&#162;t
care about the life of those OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in
our country. I won't be surprised to see another attack in next few months
in Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it. It can just happen to anyone,
except politicians! And they know it very well that they are always going to
be safe due to high personal security. I don't see any GOD for these people
who just don't perform their duties for which they were elected by the
civilians. 

Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for terrorists,
coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a miserable
life. There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people. Cut down
their sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them live a
miserable life in their own country. I am so angry on the way politicians of
my country operate and couldn&#162;t really sleep from last 3 days or concentrate
on my work. May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to take birth in the
country that is always operated by incompetent and impotent politicians!
Probably, our politicians were never fed with their mother's breast milk and
must have been fed by some bitches on the street! That is why they have no
love for their nation! 

Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
single solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can
bring a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will,
but I feel they might) act on terrorism then... 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

If you meet any Indian politician, ask him to kill me. I don't want a death
from some terrorist in my own country!!!
