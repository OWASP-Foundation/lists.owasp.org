<PRE>Dear Patron,

 

Trust that you are doing well!
As an esteemed member of OWASP Delhi Chapter we wanted to wish you a Very
Happy and Prosperous New Year 2009. 

 

Our strength has been growing on daily basis and as of date we have
patronization of over 326 members who share there research, experiences and
guidelines with there continuous regular postings on message boards. On the
Last day of the year 2008 we would like to take this opportunity to thank
all the members for the support that they have extended in making this year
successful once again

 

Further more just to recap the activities and the new ventures which Delhi
Chapter had entered into are shared for everyone's notice :

 

q       The year started with the launch of the First Application Security
Conference in India by OWASP Delhi Chapter and was customized for the
benefit of the Indian geography addressing critical pain points and issues
which we deal with on day to day basis. The conference &quot;OWASP AppSec India
Conference 2008&quot; was held in New Delhi on 19th and 20th August, 2008 at
India Habitat Centre, and received an overwhelming response from all corners
of India with attendance of almost 350 delegates and well over 150 companies
involved in the business. The Star Speakers at the conference included even
Dr. Kamlesh Bajaj who Heads DSCI which is a NASSCOM initiative, and the
hands-on workshops included world acclaimed speakers and instructors Like
Jason Li (OWASP Foundation), Shreeraj Shah (Blue Infy), Mano Paul (SecuRisk
Solutions), Nishchal Bhalla (Security Compass), Gaurav Kumar (Microsoft) and
others..

The conference was also well sponsored and supported by HP Software,
Paladion, SDGC Software, Armorise Technologies, Torrid Networks, Ostfold

With this overwhelming success the Second Edition is being planned to be
