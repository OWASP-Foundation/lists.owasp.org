<PRE>One of my colleagues just shared this with me which i thought of extending
to everyone, this indeed can serve as a powerful medium of expression. Just
go through it :

Did you know that there is a system in our constitution, as per the 1969
act, in section &quot; 49-O&quot; that a person can go to the polling booth, confirm
his identity, get his finger marked and convey the presiding election
officer that he doesn't want to vote anyone!

Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never
disclosed it....
This is called &quot;49-O&quot;.

Why should you go and say &quot; I VOTE NOBODY&quot;... because, in a ward, if a
candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
&quot;49-O&quot; votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the contestants
will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling, since people had
already expressed their decision on them.
This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates for
their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....

Please spread this news to as many as you know...
Seems to be a wonderful weapon against corrupt parties in India ... show
your power, expressing your desire not to vote for anybody, is even more
powerful than voting.... so don't miss your chance. So either vote, or vote
not to vote (vote 49-O)

Use your voting right for a better INDIA
