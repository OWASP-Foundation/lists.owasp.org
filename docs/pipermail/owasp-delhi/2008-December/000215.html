As rightly said - the PCI DSS standard is for credit card data protection.
It is mandated by the Card industry which founded the standards. Compliance
is necessary by any entity processing, storing or transmitting credit card
info. However, the nature of audit depends on the volume of transaction. 6
million records and above have to go in for an onsite audit. Less than that
- a self assessment questionnaire needs to be filled up and vetted and sent
as compliance to PCI DSS. As far as I know, there is no merchant or service
provider in India who meet the requirement for an onsite audit.

 

Talking of standards - are there any standards for application security
against which they can be certified. Common Criteria is one but scope of CC
is much wider. Any ideas?

Monika Lal

PCI DSS is a standard which was founded by visa, mastercard, am ex among
others. its purely a standard for protecting credit card data. I dont think
it would be prudent to have PCI DSS included in IT act or for that matter
including any standard in the IT act. Laws can not be goverened by standard
run by private intitutions. However since credit cards in india can only be
issued by banks, RBI can issue guidelines to banks to adhere to a set
acceptable standard. it could be PCI DSS or any other.

The PCI security Standard council, has fixed standard on who should undergo
certification under PCI DSS. As per my last understanding, any one
processing, storing, transmitting more than 6 million records annually needs
to have certification done. So merchants such as Shoppers Stop would come in
close. Banks such as SBI, ICICI and Citi would also fall under this
category. however adherance to this guidelines seems to be low. not sure
why. Since the certification is purely govered by this private institution,
it seems they have some exception process. 

Hope this is helpful

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta
