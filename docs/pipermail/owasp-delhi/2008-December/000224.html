<PRE>Hi List,

&gt;<i>From the varied responses that have been generated in response, I would
</I>like to clarify one issue - while I am perfectly aware that mere
compliance with PCI DSS does not guarantee security of the transaction, in
the absence of any other &quot;incentive&quot; to security, this is the only
mechanism available today.  If the same companies (VISA, Mastercard, etc)
can comply to these standards abroad, what is the reason for them not to
insist on compliance in India for the same standards.  As a lot of you
have pointed out, this standard has been drawn up by the card vendors, so
the inventive must be on them to declare themselves as &quot;PCI DSS
Certified&quot;.

My point about its inclusion in IT Act is just to ensure that.  It also
ensures that more people (and not just the security industry) are aware of
the requirements.

I will illustrate with an example.  In a Shopping Mall I got into an
argument with the sales staff who were swiping my card in their cash
register as well.  I asked if they could ensure the security of my
information entered into their terminal.  They obviously had no clue as to
what I was talking about.  I later got a call from one of their Security
personnel who assured me that all information is secure with them.  When I
asked on what this assurance was based and whether they had heard of ISO
27001 certification or even PCI DSS, the gentleman was totally lost and
promised to get back.  It has been three months now and I am not exactly
loosing any sleep waiting for his call.

My point is that most companies are not aware of the security risks
associated with e-business and most wouldn't care less.  Unless there is
some sort of mechanism in place that ensures compliance with some
standard, nobody will  even talk about security of information.

Regards

Subhash Dutta
