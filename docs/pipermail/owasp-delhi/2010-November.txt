CALL FOR PAPERS

COMPUTE 2011: The 4th International Conference in the annual conference
series of ACM Bangalore Chapter,
http://www.http://compute.acmbangalore.org/



25-26 March, 2011

It is widely recognized that Information Technology and applied research in
Computer Science will play an increasingly vital role in business and
industry. This is particularly true in the area of information management
and knowledge services. There has been an explosive growth of digital
content and handheld devices and vast networks of sensors have become
ubiquitous. As a result of these developments, massive amounts of data and
information are becoming available for numerical and symbolic processing and
analysis. This information is a virtual goldmine for society, government and
industry, but the task of extracting, analyzing and storing relevant
information and making it available to the right user (or application) at
the right time poses formidable technological challenges, many of which
remain unsolved. The COMPUTE 2011 has  brings together researchers,
practitioners and technology market movers in order to advance the state of
the art and practice in computer science research as it applies to these
technological challenges and to help bridge the digital divide.

************************************************************

Dear All,



May we know the tools(open source, freeware and commercial tools) and scripts available for Session ID analysis in web applications. Which commercial tool is best for Session ID analysis ?



Many companies working in IT Security but do not perform Session ID analysis and so how do they conclude the risk analysis of Session ID during web application penetration testing & assessment ? Is the Session ID generated by .NET application/ framework safe enough. how about java web applications ? 



regards,

suresh

Hi suresh

One good tool for session ID analysis is Owasp - Webscarab.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project

It can extract and plot session ID values over time in graphical format and
help inferring its randomness. You can even use Burp-Sequencer for indepth
analysis for the session IDs.

Suresh,

Apparently WebScarab and Burp-Sequencer are undoubtedly unmatched tools,
however these tools would only help you test the Entropy of the Session Ids
i.e. how random they are against reverse-engineering.

Another aspect of the Session ID analysis is to fuzz the Session-Header
value i.e. supplying malicious values in the Session Header field. Fuzzing
is a great option to catch any exceptions w.r.t SIDs. Popular free fuzzers
include SPIKE Proxy, Peach Fuzzer Framework. There is a Fuzzer-UI available
in WebScarab besides the Session-ID analysis tab.

Hope that helps.

Hi Suresh,

You can also use "IBM Rational Token Analyzer" which come as a part of power
tool with IBM Rational Appscan. It also provides a good analysis. There are
few places where WebScarab and Burp-Sequencer have limitation like capturing
of token in case of a flow or multistage transactions. In that case this
tool work perfectly.

Though not exactly what you need, this paper here http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/testing/guidelines-developing-penetration-rules-behavior_259 at SANS will give you some hints as to what to ask from a client.

Hi Komal, 

Have you tested this before posting on the list ? I found this to be a
possible malware dropper.

There are two suspicious files in the /data folder which write in to remote
process memory.
/data/app.exe and /data/dummy.exe

Have you tested this before posting on the list ? I found this to be a possible malware dropper. 

There are two suspicious files in the /data folder which write in to remote process memory.
/data/app.exe and /data/dummy.exe

After some basic analysis, it appears to me that the JAR finally drops a
server.exe (2/40 - VT
http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=ebc79807e87ec1171a085569f7eee866f6cbea50d15e643573bdb77641e918ea-1290077246
).

The server.exe appears to be meterpreter_reverse_https which injects into
iexplore.exe and tries to connect to 121.242.69.84.static-delhi.vsnl.net.in.

21/tcp   open   ftp?

5555/tcp closed freeciv

The listener however, seems down ATM. Hmm..

	Injection
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=QDwyGAv9xX3hs2G55CbsfqRwUfc3qf9wKV+C3@mail.gmail.com>

Microsoft network uses transfer file module over HTTPS which is a part of
internal FTM process. This module was prone to input injection scenario and
reflected errors shown the high possibility of SQL injection. The error
leveraged lot of potential information about module which could be used to
exploit the inherent functionality of FTM. Primarily, it can be fuzzed more
intensively by generating false metadata combination which can be passed as
an input to FTM.

@Atul Exactly..  It drops the server.exe and as you have mentioned the file
itself is suspicious. I had some suspicious behavior on my system even
though I blocked the server.exe file. My IDS immediately started picking up
detection 

It made me even more curious and trying to figure out what all I have done
on the recent past and I see only this JAR file which I tried to execute.

 

Anyways this is my IDS Log

11/18/2010 4:17:30 PM  Intrusion.Win.MSSQL.worm.Helkern      219.146.143.209
UDP       1434

11/18/2010 4:19:37 PM  Intrusion.Win.MSSQL.worm.Helkern      218.201.144.133
UDP       1434

 

They both track down to Chinese IP though.

 

Speaking about all this did someone find any luck on the facebook
vulnerability as mentioned on the first mail of this chain?

guys some simple analysis to add
i scanned the files through some link analysers
below are the reports.


http://wepawet.iseclab.org/view.php?hash=3b023200b710ab390be685ef860570ad&t=1290102813&type=js
here you can see some unescape functions, you may try to decrypt it

Hi List

NoScript fails to detect the reflective XSS from trusted domains when an
attack is conducted through SQLXSSI. The bypass in NoScript has been
successfully conducted by using "Reflective XSS" through Union SQL
poisoning attacks by exploiting the reverted errors in the browser. The
attack string used to bypass is stated below

http://www.example.com/news.php?news=12%27union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,0x3c7363726970743e616c657274282f73636861702f293c2f7363726970743e,9,10,11,12,version%28%29%20from%20tbl_news--<http://www.example.com/news.php?news=12%27union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,0x3c7363726970743e616c657274282f73636861702f293c2f7363726970743e,9,10,11,12,version%28%29%20from%20tbl_news--+>

The attacker can create a potential attack patterns using the above stated
vector.

The exploitation video has been released at SecNiche Security channel -

Disclosure: The bug was disclosed to the author on 24th November 2010. A
new version of NoScript 2.0.6 is released today (25th November 2010).
Further, NoScript 2.0.6 version fails to combat against this attack vector
and can be bypassed with the same.



Thanks & Regards

26th November 2010, two years from the dark day for the Indians when
few Islamic terrorists from Pakistan opened fire at few key public
places of Mumbai, killing around 175 people and wounding many.

A group of young and enthusiastic Indian hackers, tagged as Indian
Cyber Army (ICA) powered by indishell.in, carried a mass defacement
operation against many public and official websites belonging to
Pakistan in order to pay their homage to the martyr of the terrorist
incident. Hacker Regiment sources talked to few hackers belonging to
ICA to understand their modus operandi behind such cyber attacks.
Jackh4x0r and LuCkY told that most of the group members are already
well settled and earning good money out of their professions.
?Monetary benefits is not the motivation for any of the group members
to carry out such cyber attacks, this particular attack was to convey
a message to the Pakistani citizens on opposing the terror route being
followed by their nation to disturb neighbours. And 26/11 was the
ideal time for conveying this message when our brave soldiers laid
their precious life for the country people? said Jackh4x0r.
