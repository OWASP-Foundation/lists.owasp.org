	site
Message-ID: <3542efac0910061121p71a17debx4f530e8523dc1022@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OWASP,

I am writing this such that it can be informed to concerned authorities.
I tried to find mail id of the respective institue to inform them but
could'nt find any.

Details are as follows....
Visit to anypage on* http://www.nagarjunauniversity.ac.in*
and right click to "View Source", we'll find the following site embedded in
iframe *http://bale.ws/show.php*
When we open above site it gets redirected to *
http://superpupermegacasino.com/* which hosts *SmartDownload.exe*

Details of the EXE at virustotal is shown as *Win32/CasOnline!Adware*
http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/9709a6f32be02642671f96ee264bae85fc924072ceb1a6f07c94ab94ae77943d-1254763534


the page has eval() and base64_decode() methods. When we decode the base64
content site *esli.tw* is embedded.

There is one more site embedded *http://b.nt002.cn/E/J.JS*

When we visit few pages on this site and if any AV is installed on ur
machine (McAfee AntiVirus is installed in my case and triggers PDF-Exploit
alert) it should trigger some alert.

Interested folks can further analyze. Please inform concerned guys from
Nagarjuna University.

Best Regards,
Praveen Darshanam,
Security Researcher

Hi Praveen,

Its appreciative and encouraging that your intent is good so to inform and
get the university guys fix the aforementioned vulnerability.
Notwithstanding, it is very much vital for us that we should comply with
the policies of a "Responsible Disclosure of the vulnerabilities".

Just for being safe in the first place and start the conversation with "I
tried to inform the guys but of no luck" is not an excuse for disclosing the
vulnerability in public. Believe me, its not appropriate for "us" ethically
or legally to stir up such instigations while we talk about responsibly
disclosing the flaws.

I just wanted to bring the fact to the notice of the OWASP community (and
moderators ofcourse) that this should be happening through appropriate
channels first rather than appropriate mailing lists. To my surprise, some
guy disclosed an XSS vulnerability in a popular railway reservation web
application some time ago. Are we sure that the respective administrators
are following the mailing lists while we talk about the flaws and the
exploits? I hopefully anticipate that you are getting what I am talking
about but if you are still perplexed what I am actually referring to, you
may want to have a look at these:

1.
http://www.csoonline.com/article/440110/The_Vulnerability_Disclosure_Game_Are_We_More_Secure_?CID=28071
2. http://www.cert.org/kb/vul_disclosure.html
3. http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/vdwgreport.pdf

Hope that you (and everyone of us) will find these useful and not to blank
out, no offense at all :)

Warm regards,
-Gunwant

Dear Friends,

I wanted to know about few things about  OWASP Webscrap tool for Security 
Testing.
1)  Can we check all OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability with the help of it. If 
not what all things we can test.
2)  What all reports can be generated using this tool.

Also , If possible please provide me with the list of Freeware which can 
be used for Application Security Testing for Web Application developed in 
ASP.NET3.5

Hi Sawarni,

Answers are inline:

1)  Can we check all OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability with the help of it. If not
what all things we can test.

Almost every issue you can test. From XSS to Injection attacks as well as
SessionID analysis you can test with it.
You can use it as a fuzzer and plugin for Web Services testing is also
available.

2)  What all reports can be generated using this tool.

I don't think it's a report generation tool. But you can generate graphs for
SessionID generation pattern to analyze.

Also , If possible please provide me with the list of Freeware which can be
used for Application Security Testing for Web Application developed in
ASP.NET3.5

You can use free proxies like Paros,Burp,Webscarab...etc Fuzzers like SQL
Inject me,XSS me.There are much more tools...you can google fro them.

Hi Angad,

The answer is yes we recommend (and actually must) depending on the
vulnerability found in ASP.NET application. This is a good practice if you
are going to be more helpful to the client for fixing up the flaws.
For example for error handling you can suggest them to have this kind of
into the web.config file:

<customErrors mode="RemoteOnly"defaultRedirect="~/errors/GeneralError.aspx" />

Or even for viestate encryption you might set the following:

<pages theme="Default" viewStateEncryptionMode="Always"
enableViewStateMac="true"></pages>

Regarding any tool for checking the settings in web.config I am not aware
of,if any.

Hope I have answered your question,if any query,please feel free to revert
back.
