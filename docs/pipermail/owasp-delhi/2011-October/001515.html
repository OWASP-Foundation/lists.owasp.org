<PRE>Dear OWASP Delhi Members,

I was thinking to give out a surprise to the OWASP community on our upcoming
conference in India (Delhi). But may be it was not meant to be a surprise,
instead of selecting other OWASP address, mistakenly I selected OWASP delhi
list and my previous mail on the list has already disclosed the planning.
Anyways, that demonstrates a good reason to use DLP solutions in the
corporate where the information gets leaked unintentionally, by selecting
the wrong email address :-) Doesn't matter in the open community where
everything is open!

Yes, so finally I am planning the upcoming conference in the month of May,
tentative dates are 17th and 18th May 2012. Right now, I am getting the
things approved from the OWASP Board in the US. Soon, we should be out with
the agenda.

We have planned the agenda as per the feedback we have received from the
last 2 conferences, it would be 1 day conference, since 2 days looked bore
to many. Training of 2 days ate away lot of your time, so we have planned
multiple tracks of half days, much like what we did in 2008. Feel free to
write me offline if you wish to see some modifications.

Get yourself ready for the next InfoSec blast.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv
