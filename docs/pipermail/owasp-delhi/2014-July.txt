Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] Discussing latest AppSec news?
Message-ID: <CAN9ux9w_8Q4cJSh0p97peBH=AtiY8axjpsWHYnmrdukygb32dA@mail.gmail.com>

Fellow Delhi OWASPers,

Check this out:
http://appseceurope2014.sched.org/event/ad83bfacf242bfc2766203cf7318f588#%2EU6SIkPldUm9

Seems like a fun way to discuss latest AppSec news. Want to try out
something similar (as a 15-20 minute session) during our meets?

Hi All,

An interesting tool that can assist into securing development processes.

"Dependency-Check is a utility that identifies project dependencies and
checks if there are any known, publicly disclosed, vulnerabilities.
Currently Java and .NET dependencies are supported; however, support for
Node.JS, client side JavaScript libraries, etc. is planned.

This tool can be part of a solution to the OWASP Top 10 2013 A9 - Using
Components with Known Vulnerabilities."

Hi,



I was not able to attend the chapter meeting due to some personal issues...
I hope that some more members were also not able to attend the meeting...
for the benefit me and others I request meeting organizers to share the
minutes of meeting and copy pretensions if available.

Mohammed Zuber

Hi Mohammed,

Thanks for the inquiry. The meet was held as per the detailed agenda
published on the chapter page: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Delhi. This
serves the purpose of meeting minutes as well so, no plans of preparing and
circulating them separately.

Regarding presentation slides, these will be made available on Slideshare
here: http://www.slideshare.net/OWASPDelhi.

Hope this helps.

Vishal
