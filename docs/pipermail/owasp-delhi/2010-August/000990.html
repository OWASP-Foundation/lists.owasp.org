Forgot to mention &#8211; OWASP Delhi Committee Members while
being on the board will be entitled to attend any OWASP Conference in Delhi at
no cost (i.e. FREE as in beer).  

 &#160; 

Tomorrow evening 1800hrs has been kept as the closing time for
the nominations and we will announce the shortlisted committee members on
Friday. So, hurry up and show-up for a good cause, communities are meant to be driven
by people, for people. You are very much amongst former or the later group but
your presence in both the groups would certainly bring the difference! 

 &#160; 

Look forward to your interest. 

 &#160; 

Cheers! 

Dhruv 

 &#160;

Subject: Volunteers Needed for OWASP Committees 





 &#160; 

Dear
All, 

 &#160; 

Its
been a while since we could gather for a chapter meeting and discuss on variety
of InfoSec issues. Lately, I have been receiving lot of calls from members
expressing their interest to attend OWASP Delhi Chapter meetings but hectic
schedule on our part made it difficult for us to devote time organizing the
meetings. May I please request members here to participate as volunteers and
carry the OWASP flagship forward. Out of several tasks, below are few of the
important ones with brief responsibility for which you may nominate yourself as
committee members to work shoulder to shoulder with OWASP Delhi Board: 

 &#160; 

1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Speaker
Coordination Committee (SCC) 

a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Float the CFP (Call
for papers) on the list, shortlist the speakers/topics, share the list of
speakers with WMC (point 4) 

 &#160; 

2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Venue
Coordination Committee (VCC) 

a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Identifying the
companies who wish to sponsor our chapter meeting, visiting the venue to
approve the logistics, announcing the venue. Sharing the list of participants
with the sponsor. Advance visit before meeting to ensure everything is plugged  

 &#160; 

3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Participant
Coordination Committee (PCC) 

a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Preparing the list
of participants who wish to attend the OWASP meeting. Handing over the final
list to VCC. Getting the link for agenda from WMC and announcing it to the
list.  

 &#160; 

4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Wikipedia
Management Committee (WMC) 

a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Coordinate with SCC
and VCC and update the meeting agenda on the OWASP Wiki 

 &#160; 

What
do you get in return? Visibility, credibility, learning, networking and above
all, a great level of satisfaction by devoting few hours towards a good cause.  

 &#160; 

Note: OWASP chapter
meetings are open and free to all the participants. There is no sponsorship fees
attached. Sponsors only need to avail their venue for few hours with A/V
equipped along with high-tea for the participants. In case your company wish to
sponsor upcoming chapter meeting please let us know. It doesn&#8217;t cost a
thing and provides a good branding opportunity for companies to showcase their
seriousness towards information security. 

 &#160; 

Please
write me offline with your interest to participate in any/multiple committee(s)
of your choice. Suggestions always welcome. 

 &#160; 

Many
Thanks, 

Dhruv
Soi 

Chair
&#8211; OWASP India, Director &#8211; OWASP Delhi Chapter 

 &#160; 

&#8220;what
goes around comes around.&#8221;
