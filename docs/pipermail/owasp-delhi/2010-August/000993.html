<PRE>I agree with Dhruv here. Both Dhruv and I have spent a good amount of effort and time to build this chapter. The sole objective is to promote awareness and education along with professional networking through sharing of knowledge and ideas. To see only two nominations for this cause is really disappointing.

I sincerely feel that we have a lot of like minded folks on this list who can make a difference by volunteering and contributing for this noble cause.

Hoping that the message would encourage atleast few if not all to come forward.

Best Regards

Puneet Mehta
Co-chair OWASP India
Director- OWASP Delhi Chapter

Sorry for the top posting again. I am really thankful to all the members who have expressed their willingness to volunteer for this noble cause. 

 

But what I feel like missing is, OWASP Delhi Chapter carries maximum members in comparison to any other OWASP Chapter across the globe and still it could only find nomination from around 10+ members expressing interest as volunteers. It&#8217;s a volunteering effort so it definitely comes from heart and we can&#8217;t force, but for those who couldn&#8217;t nominate, I thought to share my personal blog link from my Mar10 post which was on similar lines in a way, hope should be helpful to some in some mean: <A HREF="http://dhruvsoi.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-is-purpose-of-my-life.html">http://dhruvsoi.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-is-purpose-of-my-life.html</A> 

 

For sure, am not trying to promote my personal blog, have got enough readers. Everything is meant for you, just thought to share some insights. Please consider it as a spam and ignore if you don&#8217;t like it. But act before its too late.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Forgot to mention &#8211; OWASP Delhi Committee Members while being on the board will be entitled to attend any OWASP Conference in Delhi at no cost (i.e. FREE as in beer). 

 

Tomorrow evening 1800hrs has been kept as the closing time for the nominations and we will announce the shortlisted committee members on Friday. So, hurry up and show-up for a good cause, communities are meant to be driven by people, for people. You are very much amongst former or the later group but your presence in both the groups would certainly bring the difference!

 

Look forward to your interest.

 

Cheers!

Dhruv

Subject: Volunteers Needed for OWASP Committees

 

Dear All,

 

Its been a while since we could gather for a chapter meeting and discuss on variety of InfoSec issues. Lately, I have been receiving lot of calls from members expressing their interest to attend OWASP Delhi Chapter meetings but hectic schedule on our part made it difficult for us to devote time organizing the meetings. May I please request members here to participate as volunteers and carry the OWASP flagship forward. Out of several tasks, below are few of the important ones with brief responsibility for which you may nominate yourself as committee members to work shoulder to shoulder with OWASP Delhi Board:

 

1.     Speaker Coordination Committee (SCC)

a.     Float the CFP (Call for papers) on the list, shortlist the speakers/topics, share the list of speakers with WMC (point 4)

 

2.     Venue Coordination Committee (VCC)

a.     Identifying the companies who wish to sponsor our chapter meeting, visiting the venue to approve the logistics, announcing the venue. Sharing the list of participants with the sponsor. Advance visit before meeting to ensure everything is plugged 

 

3.     Participant Coordination Committee (PCC)

a.     Preparing the list of participants who wish to attend the OWASP meeting. Handing over the final list to VCC. Getting the link for agenda from WMC and announcing it to the list. 

 

4.     Wikipedia Management Committee (WMC)

a.     Coordinate with SCC and VCC and update the meeting agenda on the OWASP Wiki

 

What do you get in return? Visibility, credibility, learning, networking and above all, a great level of satisfaction by devoting few hours towards a good cause. 

 

Note: OWASP chapter meetings are open and free to all the participants. There is no sponsorship fees attached. Sponsors only need to avail their venue for few hours with A/V equipped along with high-tea for the participants. In case your company wish to sponsor upcoming chapter meeting please let us know. It doesn&#8217;t cost a thing and provides a good branding opportunity for companies to showcase their seriousness towards information security.

 

Please write me offline with your interest to participate in any/multiple committee(s) of your choice. Suggestions always welcome.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv Soi
