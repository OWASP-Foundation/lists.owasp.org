Hello,

Can you share name/URLs for few good products to protect the website from DDoS? I know about Arbornetworks and Akamai services but keen to know what is being used by the giants like google, Facebook, etc.

Thanks in advance,

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

i will suggest cloudflare its the best free resource available.
As far as google and facebook are concerned they have their own Ddos
protection mechanisms implemented from the core and i guess you know
facebook is a part of International Ferderal agencies like FBI they provide
them with the backend protection .

I you are looking for more commercial  companies i am not mentioning them
here it will look like i am advertising here on my mailing list. I can mail
u if u want ?

Thank You

CloudFlare and other cloud based solutions are meant for SMEs and most of them work by owning and watching name servers of a particular domain and is offered as managed services. That's not a foolproof method, as far as I know. I didn't know google or Facebook have their own mechanisms, do you have any authentic URL mentioning so? It would be interesting to read.

FBI, CIA stuff is mostly overhyped and rumored, just like we see Chinese-Chinese everywhere. Why would FBI build a DDoS protection mechanism for a private company, where GBs of FBIs top secret data is being disclosed by hackers (anonymous). FBI is infact dependent on Facebook for many of their investigations, there is an alliance for logs but doesn't mean alliance for DDoS protection.

I wonder online/ecommerce/bfsi companies in India at all using foolproof DDoS protection mechanisms, also I feel there might not be huge threat as compared to international companies.  Any comments from any one?

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Dhruv,

AFAIK, there isn't any foolproof system for DDoS protection. Even the
commercial wares that are being offered to the stakeholders do seem to
collapse after a certain level. However, I am sure there are products that
perform better than others to minimize the DDoS affect in an effective
manner. Such products, besides dealing with distributed sourceless traffic,
also restore services back to normal in a shorter period of time as
compared to others.

I happen to find this (little old) URL in my Favourites that may be helpful
to you. It states some products/scripts/tools including the ones you
mentioned and the different technologies that the vendors deploy to defeat
such attacks. It looks interesting to me.

http://www.crn.com/slide-shows/applications-os/220301101/fighting-the-clouds-biggest-threat-top-ways-to-stop-ddos.htm?pgno=1

Also, we did a PoC from another vendor in the past which was quite
impressive but we did not hire them (apparently) because of the political
issues. Here:
http://www.verisigninc.com/assets/datasheet-ddos-protection-services-overview.pdf

On the Google/FB point, I think it is difficult for anyone to say or name a
single product that they use. What I think is that they may be using
multiple products and/or their home-grown technologies.

Agreed, its not 100% foolproof but I feel it still misses out from the
agenda of Indian online industry, appears there is lesser threat and lack
of need.

It would be interesting to learn what solutions are being used by companies
like makemytrip.com, naukri.com, snaldeap.com, indiatimes.com, rediff, etc.
or there is nothing.

Good to see you back in action :-) Thanks for the link, its interesting.

Cheers!

Dear Druv,
Thanks to Gunwant .

I guess verisign is  one of the top provider but i'll say give
http://www.blockdos.net a try . I have messed up with that service
personally and its real good .And u said above nothing is 100% foolproof
even Amazon refused to get hacked but  cannot save itself from DDOS  :)
,...lmao


As far as the facebook  is concerned i don't wanna say much but i'll
suggest something :--

* Guess u missed the Anonymous events read the HBgary data and FBI releases
and try to know the reasons of failure of #OPFACEBOOK if you are connected
with any 1 of them.*
