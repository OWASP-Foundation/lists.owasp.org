Hi Suresh,

            It does not matter whether u are talking about input sanitization or output sanitization.

 

And data that is used for framing the SQL needs to be validated, irrespective of its source. Even if the source is from within the database or is from any other trusted source, it is better to validate it from the database SQL perspective.

 

The same holds good for XSS as well.

 

Thanks & Regards,

hi OWASP Delhi,

Could 'sanitization' (input sanitization) be an effective remedy for sql injection ?

For XSS, which is better, input sanitization or output sanitization ?

Any industry standards for sanitizations ?

Thanks & regards,

a book release by Jeffrey Carr with the title: "Inside Cyber Warfare:

Jefferey Carr also presented at recent OWASP India conference held in

My 2 paise/cents and bit more ;) :

1. "Could 'sanitization' (input sanitization) be an effective remedy for sql injection ?" - It could help but validation is better for sure for SQL Injection as mentioned by Venkat!

SQL Injection can also be prevented by simple design patterns that act as sanitizors. Example: OR mapping frameworks, Paremeterized stored procs (but deps on the proc), google it man :)

2. "For XSS, which is better, input sanitization or output sanitization ?"

There's already been a lot of discussion on this. 

Am not sure what Venkat means by "The same holds good for XSS as well" coz XSS is a different ball game. 

You could kill an ant with a bom or you may want to consider OWASP open source tools, Define a security policy that states from a web aspect what is permissable and what isn't and review it with IT / business users. 

Plus I wudnt put XSS validation at the data source level so for me its not the same coz having ever changing security policies mixed with low level sanitization would be a pain to mintain. 

..Its same in the basic principle of sanitization/validation. But approaching these two problems is different and requires thoght as per requirements.

3. Last but not the least; I don't think "Sanitize/Validate everything even internal" is always right. Just like you don't use "https" for every web page or synchronize every code block of code (overkills)  :). One has to look at the domain, requirements, usability, maintainability etc to decide. Idealistically if validation is not costly maybe but practically due to many reasons; maybe not!

Checkmarx Research Labs has identified a new critical vulnerability in
Internet Explorer (other browsers are probably exposed the same way) that
would allow hackers to easily compromise web applications. Cross-Site
History Manipulation (XSHM) is a newly discovered zero-day attack: attackers
may have been using it for a long time, but the application and security
communities do not know it.

Well, in the previous post that I shared as an article from NYTimes, one
might have noticed the comments from Chinese hacker where he says:

 

"Microsoft
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/microsoft_corporation
/index.html?inline=nyt-org>  and Adobe have a lot of zero days," he said,
while scanning Web sites at home. "But we don't publish them. We want to
save them so that some day we can use them."

 

Which is pretty obvious and time will prove it as well. Digging more into
their strategy and past trends it is not really difficult to make out exact
time, month, day when they launch their espionage operations. There would be
lot more fun in coming months. whew! J

From whatever I've been following on the topic, there doesn't seem to be anything "critical" to it.

Just one of those instances where a security company/lab decides to cash on in FUD. Kindly follow the "websecurity" mailing list at "webappsec.org" for further details.

*IDG News Service:* A well-known security researcher yesterday showed how to
subvert security in the Oracle 11g database by exploiting zero-day
vulnerabilities that would let a savvy user gain full and complete control.

David Litchfield, a researcher at NGS Consulting, demonstrated how a user
can subvert security to elevate his privileges to take complete control over
Oracle 11g and also showed how to bypass the Oracle Label Security used to
set mandatory access controls over information depending on security level.

IBM ISS Researcher Exposes Holes In Cisco's Internet Surveillance
Architecture

Wiretapping architecture could be abused by individuals under surveillance
and outside attackers; Cisco reviews recommended fixes
Feb 03, 2010 | 01:03 PM

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Black Hat DC 2010 -- An IBM ISS researcher here today
revealed major security holes in a little-known wiretapping architecture for
IP networks created by Cisco Systems for law enforcement. The weaknesses
could result in an attacker interfering with legal surveillance or
performing some unauthorized surveillance of his own.

Tom Cross, manager of X-Force Research at IBM ISS, says he first discovered
the Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept in IP Networks, which was
published as an IETF RFC in 2004, four years ago.


Cross says Cisco's configuration guide for the architecture recommends that
network administrators enable SNMP trap notifications to detect potential
threats on SNMPv3 authentication, and it "implies" that traps will be sent
for packets that carry an incorrect authentication key or any other packet
that isn't part of the approved access list.

is pointed to some other IP. IP looks to be of the same range as NS for
tcs.com so hopefully all is well. Sysadmin might not find good appraisal
this season!

Strange. It was different when I last did. Could be under maintenance or
misconfiguration, doesn't seem to be defacement though! Rest TCS folks on
the lists can confirm.

Message-ID: <4b6eadec.9713f30a.3f48.2aa7@mx.google.com>

Here is the sequence that I observed:

 

1.     www.tcs.com and tcs.com were found to be pointing to different IPs.
www.tcs.com was working properly with
http://www.tcs.com/homepage/Pages/default.aspx as default home page and
tcs.com was available for sale. 

2.     After a while, Rakshit pointed that both the domains had same IP
address but tcs.com was still "available for sale" while www.tcs.com was
working. Till this time, it appeared to be some configuration error.

3.     Waited for some more time, both the domains were available for sale.
With all the files deleted from the web root of www.tcs.com. I tried
http://www.tcs.com/homepage/Pages/default.aspx  and
http://www.tcs.com/careers to get runtime error and page not found error
respectively. Couple of their other portals like nextstep etc. were throwing
error to the browser while accepting ssl certificates. Not sure, if it is
usual or appeared today only.

 

The domain sale page had a contact listed abed_uk at hotmail.com. I googled
this email account to find it listed as technical contact for many domains
with a similarity that all those domains were registered at Network
Solutions and obviously had same "available for sales" page set as home
page. Seems that their server(s) was compromised for few hours today.

Correct. The IP address that was resolving against the domain during
compromised period was: 205.178.152.154 and now after restoration its:
216.15.200.140. So not really network/application attack but DNS/account
compromise.

Dhruv,

I just want to add that based on your description it is not the server but
the domain registar or their account there that was probably compromised.

Hi All

0x00 Tech Gyan of the month
0x01 Legal Gyan of the month
0x02 Command Line Gyan of the month
0x03 Tool Gyan of the month
0x04 Mom's Guide of the month
0x05 Awareness Poster of the month

In future we'll add more sections as per the demand of the community.

If this is repeat attack, then, this seems to be serious and it seems
twitter kind of attack which happened few weeks back. 

 

Also as DNS servers are targeted, it would be interesting to know
whether the servers were owned by TCS or third party. If it was third
party then this attack might have affected other companies as well, if
its TCS then there will be serious questions of security measures from
their side, as it will affect their reputation badly

 

The repeat of this attack might mean the attack might have been planned
and targeted, guess more information will be unfolded in coming days

The attack so far appears to be a DNS attack.  The attack happened at the domain name registrar's end, which is Network Solutions in this case of TCS. Network Solutions is one of the top five domain name registrars on internet, managing almost 6.4 million domains.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] ] China Shut Down Biggest Hacker Training Site

China Shut Down Biggest Hacker Training Site 

By Wu Yiyao 

China Daily

2010-02-08 


<http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-02/08/content_9440667.htm> 

 

What is believed to be the country's biggest hacker training site has
been shut down by police in Central China's Hubei province.

 

Three people were also arrested, local media reported yesterday.

 

The three, who ran Black Hawk Safety Net, are suspected of offering
others online attacking programs and software, a crime recently added to
the Criminal Law. A total of 1.7 million yuan ($249,000) in assets were
also frozen.

 

According to the provincial public security department of Hubei, the
closure of the website had its roots in a previous Web attack and virus
dissemination case in the city of Macheng in 2007, when police found
some of the suspects caught were members of Black Hawk Safety Net.

 

Hubei province named Black Hawk Safety Net as the largest hacker
training site in China, which openly recruited members and disseminated
hacker techniques through lessons, trojan software and online forum
communications.

 

Since it was established in 2005, the site had recruited more than
12,000 VIP members and collected more than 7 million yuan in membership
fees. More than 170,000 people registered for free membership.

 

Police said more than 50 officers had been investigating the case.

 

They seized nine Web servers, five computers and one car, and shut down
all the sites involved in the case, according to the provincial public
security department.

 

"I could download trojan programs from the site which allowed me to
control other people's computers. I did this just for fun but I also
know that many other members could make a fortune by attacking other
people's accounts," said a 23-year-old member of Black Hawk Safety Net
in Nanjing of East China's Jiangsu province, who asked to remain
anonymous.

 

"It is not very difficult to do simple hacker tasks. Some hacker members
are teenagers who dropped out of school and make money by stealing
accounts," he said.

 

A 20-year-old college student who registered with three different hacker
training sites said a hacker training course costs from 100 to 2,000
yuan.

 

"Basically students were told how to steal accounts and use trojan
programs. Sometimes trainers show us how to write programs," he said.

 

"But now it's very difficult to become a registered member. Some
well-known hacker training sites have not been accessible since
November," he said.

 

According to a report released by the National Computer Network
Emergency Response Coordination Center of China, the hacker industry in
China caused losses of 7.6 billion yuan in 2009.

Hi Nilesh,

 

This is not the official website of AIIMS ( <http://www.aiims.edu/>
www.aiims.edu/)  rather is a group forum. This is what I could find from
contact page of the hacked website out of Google cache "Please contact us at
contact at aiims-delhi.in with all your questions and suggestions. We are a
group of 16 people at the moment and hope to have you in our team to help."

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Has any one seen instances of religious website being defaced off late? One
website yssofindia.org was recently defaced. Although we have restored the
website i wanted to check if we have seen other such instances?

HI,

 

I think there are some doubts in these websites. 

 

http://www.ignouindia.com/ 

http://www.aiims-delhi.in/

 

Both websites have been registered by same users and both have the same domain servers

i.e 


NS1.SERVAGE.NET

 

 


NS2.SERVAGE.NET

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] "Phone-by" download Scam
Message-ID: <B1870426F8577841ABF331C694239773023AAF4A@exchange.isight.local>

 A very interesting scam famous in US during end of 2009 and still
continuing to spread the malware. 

 

Refer to the link Below:

 

http://consumerist.com/2010/01/dont-let-an-unknown-caller-talk-you-into-
downloading-software.html

 

Now the interesting part here is the whois information given by someone
in the comments includes 

 

Fax: 
176. Shastri nagar, dadabari
KOTA, 324005
IN

 

If we do a fresh whois, the result for Fax contact is 

 

Fax: 

   23 Morris Avenue

   Manor Park

   London, London E12 6ER

   GB

 

Also I read somewhere that they users get calls from a call centre based
in Mumbai (don't know how much truth in this) , I feel we all should be
aware of such scams ( we  being in security might not fall prey to this,
but our no so security aware colleagues might). 

 

Does anyone else noticed such scam getting its feet in India ?

Hi Suresh,

1. Whtat are the free tools / open source tools actually and
practically used for web serv V A ? Qualys Guard and Nessus. They also give
you something like test scans using that you can run a few scans as you like
and this doesn't require paying them till a certain limit.

2. What are the commercial tools used for automated web server V A ? Qualys
Guard and Nessus again. You can configure them to run scan and throw reports
at periodic interval.

3. How a manual web server v a is conducted ? Any checklist and the
practical process. Not much idea about this one. Sorry

4. People can share their web server v a experience. - Well what the report
provides is a lot of information and there may be false positives also.
There generally are, then it will require some research and then talking to
the Asset owners of the Assets where the vulnerability exists. In Qualys
there are two kinds of vulnerability 1. Potential 2. Confirmed.

Hope this all gives you a good idea and helps you moving ahead !!

Hi Suresh,

     Apart from what Rahul suggested, you can also for GFI Languard or 
Core Impact (both proprietary). For a better hands-on and/or manual 
assessment, try using Metasploit (Opensource), though that might be more 
on the PT side.

Nothing ever's "necessary" my friend. It may be desirable & advisable though :)

For example, to run Nessus, it's not all necessary to know that some plugins (dos etc) can bring down the server. It's however desirable to have the knowledge.

I dont think so you need a real guru like exp in Networking to use Nessus, a
fair understanding about network and protocols should do, all you need to
know is about the vulnerabilities and how certain vulnerabilities work for
some particular services and ports, moreover in Nessus you are only going to
scan using a cool GUI, but that does not allow you not to know about basics
networking knowledge.

I would say yes. Almost anybody can run a tool. It is only one who is
familiar with the context that can fine-tune it to give good results in the
first place and then review the results in a meaningful manner to weed out
false positives, identify the more relevant findings and then use the
findings in the next steps of the assessment exercise.

Any particular reason you ask?

Dear OWASP Delhi,



Thank you all for the good information. but i am still confused whether "NESSUS" is a web server vulnerability assessment tool or a Network Assessment tool.



Please suggest. 



The situation is: I have to perform the V.A of IIS using a tool. So how do I start, Use NESSES and proceed or use any commercial tool. If commercial tool, then which is the widely accepted commercial tool. A organization cant have multiple commerical tool, so suggest A few commercial tools that can perform web server V.A.



Also any checklist for IIS V.A ? 



Thanks & regards,

Suresh

Nessus is a network or host vulnerability scanner. For application security scanning you will need a Web Application Security Vulnerability Scanner (WASVS) such as IBM Rational AppScan or HP Webinspect.

Hi Suresh,

     Apart from what Rahul suggested, you can also for GFI Languard or Core Impact (both proprietary). For a better hands-on and/or manual assessment, try using Metasploit (Opensource), though that might be more on the PT side.

Hi ,

      Yes, NESSUS can be used for web server VA. It is recommended to use 
the professional feeds, though. Besides you can fine tune your tests for 
IIS in NESSUS.

[Owasp-delhi] Tools for Web Server V A



Dear OWASP Delhi,

Thank you all for the good information. but i am still confused whether 
"NESSUS" is a web server vulnerability assessment tool or a Network 
Assessment tool.

Please suggest. 

The situation is: I have to perform the V.A of IIS using a tool. So how do 
I start, Use NESSES and proceed or use any commercial tool. If commercial 
tool, then which is the widely accepted commercial tool. A organization 
cant have multiple commerical tool, so suggest A few commercial tools that 
can perform web server V.A.

Also any checklist for IIS V.A ? 

Thanks & regards,
Suresh

I came across a paper by Orr Dunkelman, Nathan Keller, and Adi Shamir on 'Sandwich Attack' which describes shattering GSM 3G crypto implementation of A5/3 aka KASUMI in less than two hours on a normal PC, some of you might recognize Adi Shamir from his contribution to RSA encryption and FMS method used for cracking WEP. 


Keeping in mind the fact that A5/1 took more than a couple of months for generation of rainbow tables KASUMI turned out to be a bummer.

Hi Purohit,

In addition to everyone else's comments I would very strongly say yes,
Anybody can run a scan but when you and try and understand it will have most
of the things to do with protocols and somebody who doesn't knows network
basics and how it works its like looking at "*Niagra Falls*" [?]

Hope this helps you.

Hi , 

      Yes, NESSUS can be used for web server VA. It is recommended to
use the professional feeds, though. Besides you can fine tune your tests
for IIS in NESSUS.

[Owasp-delhi] Tools for Web Server V A

 

________________________________




Dear OWASP Delhi,

Thank you all for the good information. but i am still confused whether
"NESSUS" is a web server vulnerability assessment tool or a Network
Assessment tool.

Please suggest. 

The situation is: I have to perform the V.A of IIS using a tool. So how
do I start, Use NESSES and proceed or use any commercial tool. If
commercial tool, then which is the widely accepted commercial tool. A
organization cant have multiple commerical tool, so suggest A few
commercial tools that can perform web server V.A.

Also any checklist for IIS V.A ? 

Thanks & regards,
Suresh

Hi Suresh, 

    Apart from what Rahul suggested, you can also for GFI Languard or

assessment, try using Metasploit (Opensource), though that might be more

Dear all,

 

I think Nessus is the best tool available for web server VA yet. You can use
also Bastille templates for OS (Unix type) hardening. Nessus is tried and
tested, plus it is patched regularly. 

 

Thank you and I hope that helps,

Hi, 

 

While doing risk assessment engagements we are normally challenged with
various possible threats to a technology /asset, at times it becomes
really difficult to think what else can be added. 

 

I have found a link where a comprehensive list of threats are available
for some technologies, some of them are really helpful. 

 

https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_156/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/ITGrundschutzCat
alogues/itgrundschutzcatalogues_node.html

 

 

The link below will have some additional resources for ISMS & RA

https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_156/EN/Publications/BSIStandards/BSIStandard
s_node.html

 

 

The link below has some interesting information, in general [ Language :
German]

https://www.bsi.bund.de/cln_156/DE/Home/home_node.html

 

Best regards,

Muslim

Please try out SISA, a Bangalore based firm and very niche in the domain of PCI DSS, http://www.sisa.co.in/.  The PCI DSS practice is headed by Dharshan, who is a qualified PCI QSA and one of the first few in the country to get certified.

Their training is excellent and superb.

Hi Purohit,

You can test for the following vulnerabilities in SOAP based Web Services:
External entity
XPath / Xquery Injection
XML Injection
Recursive payload
Oversized payload
WSDL scanning
Schema poisoning
Authentication/Authorization
Input flaws (SQL / XSS)
Error handling

Hope that helps.

Hello Manik,

Webinspect is much better than Appscan since appscan shows up a lot of false positives and the best web vulnerablity canner would be Acunetix WVS + Acusensor. Please the comparision file attached.

The free version just checks for XSS and shows a lot of false positives.

It great to see the comparison. We are using AppScan for more than 5 years now and I somehow feel that it does not give me full control to do everything.

Its of course a good tool for novice starting AppSec. We also use Cenzic and it give me some extra features and maybe also a way to compare every time I get into a engagement.

FYI, AppScan has a Enterprise version and its a cool tool for a enterprise wise deployment and getting AppSec testing into SDLC.

Abir,

Thanks for this report. It gives me a good reason to try WebInspect :-)

thanks,
Gautam
