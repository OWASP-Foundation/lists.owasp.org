Dear Dhruv,

 

Yes you are right, Even I have noticed that If a website is Build,  Powered By xyz Design Company is vulnerable then there is 90% chance that all the websites build, Powered by xyz are vulnerable for the same attack.

 

just remember one nice case , One of our clients website was vulnerable for SQL, Xss, Almost everything and at the time of patching it was total mess, because they had outsourced the design, construction, etc... to one design firm and that design firm terminated operations 1 year back and now there was no source code, no design documentation, no technology documentation at the client side. They just have one vulnerable website uploaded on server .........

 

 

As long as informing ISACA Mumbai goes, I did that 8 months ago in one chapter meet at Welingkar Mumbai, If you still want to try its ok.

 

And For other website, you can inform but people dont care, If its BFSI Sector company then its ok otherwise forget it, no one is going to care.

 

Regards,

 

Amar Wakharkar.

Subject: Re: [Owasp-delhi] ISACA Mumbai SQL Injection

Thanks Amar, there are many ISACA members on this list (Including Puneet) who should help ISACA fixing this problem.

By the way, existence of such common security problem in the website of ISACA made me curious to dig a bit further in terms of soft investigation (Not Exploitation ;-)). Their website footer contains &quot;Powered By : www.mahalasainfo.com&quot;. Which reveals &quot;Security challenges while outsourcing&quot;. I am sure by now, the trick must be known to everyone. Make a quick google search to see which websites are (so called) powered by that domain and you will find every website is vulnerable to SQL injection, there are over 20. I am too lazy to find the right contact and report those companies about their websites being vulnerable. If any company is known to members around here, then please help them by reporting the vulnerability.
