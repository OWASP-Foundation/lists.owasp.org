<PRE>You are right Nitin. 
Rediff, I'm told,  is actually perfoming an assessment of things they
need to fix on all their web presence and also fixing them as they go
along. If any of you have a report on other issues on that site, pass it
along &amp; I can forward it to someone who is corrdinating these XSS's to
be fixed. Nitin, Abyaha and Nilesh are already marked on my previous
communication to that person.
 
Cheers/Sri

They may have started rectifying the vulnerabilities at moment, let's
wait for a few days more and see if it is corrected.

	         Sorry, still not fixed completely. Even on main page
itself it is restricting scripts in simple form ...but not encoded ones.
;)

	 Apart from this every second search module is suffering like
Product search, Shopping, Matcmaker, Astrology, Jobs endless.

	 Wherever is search module..high chance of vulnerability.

	 

	Abhay, main page search engine might be executing only encoded
ones, but search modules on other pages still happily executing normal
scripts. J

	 

	Just an eyewash J from Rediff.

	That's great!

	 

	Thanks a lot Nitin for your initiatives!

	It only led to getting mail from one Rediff Authority to me that
issue will be solved soon, referring my report sent to them couple of
months back. Now fixed.

	 

	Abhay, good job done!

	Hi All

	 

	I am pleased to see that the Rediff Search XSS issue has been
fixed. Although I reported the issue to Rediff, I would like to thank
some members of OWASP Delhi for having taken the matter to a higher
plane and reporting it to someone who has been proactive. 

	 

	Unfortunately, several other Rediff sites are as vulnerable to
XSS as ever. I will probably go ahead and report this issue as well.
Hopefully it gets sorted out as quickly as the previous one. 

	 

	Check it out: <A HREF="http://citadelnotes.blogspot.com">http://citadelnotes.blogspot.com</A>
