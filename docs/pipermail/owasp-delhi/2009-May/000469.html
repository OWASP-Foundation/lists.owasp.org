<PRE>HI Arun,
  What you want to achieve after putting security in standalone application?

1.       Is there any internet communication from your application?

2.       OR do you connect to internet from that PC, where your application is running?

See if it is standalone PC and application, windows itself provides security mechanism so that no one can login and use your  application.
If you want to protect your application from spam other attacks, there are different ways to protect them.

Please do clarify more on your objectives and when you say a client, does it connect to server anywhere out of your local network or within local network ?

Thanks
Sandeep Gupta

Hi Folks,

I've been trying to find out ways of performing security assessment of stand-alone windows-based client applications. But I couldn't get any lead on that.

It would be of great help, if anyone in this distro has any knowledge or prior experience in that area. Please throw some light on security assessment of stand-alone client applications.
Regards,
