<PRE>Hi,

If you are looking for a tool to test thick client applications for Security, get hold of tool called Echo Mirage.

Hi,

It is recommended to check for Security vulnerabilities even if the machine hosting the application is not connected to any network. It would not ascertain you that 'the user' would not perform any malicious activity to your application in spite of the fact that the application is to be used by the legitimate users only. You can check for issues like BoFs, Information Disclosure, R.E. of the application, Input validation etc.

Also, you can run a tool called TCP Relay which is a proxy for the TCP traffic, the same way as an HTTP proxy intercepts the HTTP traffic. Capture the TCP traffic and see if it reveals any information. Moreover, try decompiling your application if you have a little bit knowledge of the language it is built in. Try fuzzing different entry/exit points of the application. There are a lot of fuzzers available depending on the type of application you are using. Last but not the least try reading the primary memory of the host at different times while using the application so to check for any sensitive information.

Hope that helps.

HI Arun,

  What you want to achieve after putting security in standalone application?

1.       Is there any internet communication from your application?

2.       OR do you connect to internet from that PC, where your application is running?



See if it is standalone PC and application, windows itself provides security mechanism so that no one can login and use your  application.

If you want to protect your application from spam other attacks, there are different ways to protect them.



Please do clarify more on your objectives and when you say a client, does it connect to server anywhere out of your local network or within local network ?



Thanks

Sandeep Gupta

Hi Folks,



I've been trying to find out ways of performing security assessment of stand-alone windows-based client applications. But I couldn't get any lead on that.



It would be of great help, if anyone in this distro has any knowledge or prior experience in that area. Please throw some light on security assessment of stand-alone client applications.

Regards,

R.Arun Sundaresh
