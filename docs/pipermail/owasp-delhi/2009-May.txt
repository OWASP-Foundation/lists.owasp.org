I am planning to launch a website within the next two months. The site is
built upon an open source PHP web-script. As I am a student, I can't afford
to hire a security expert. Can you suggest me some free tools if any which
might help me in examining the site for vulnerabilities?

hi OWASP Delhi,



For all i have been thinking to discuss an important issue:



There are so many IT companies developing web applications, but are all these web application tested (audit or pen test) ? how do the companies go about ? What should be ratio of security testers to developers in a company ? 



Is The Browser Cache issue mapped to "Broken Access Control" or "Broken Authentication and Session management" . Please clarify.



Also how to try Command injection in a website for testing. Any cheat sheet ?



Thanks & regards,

Suresh.

Dear Nilesh

I checked with the XSSed website once I posted this on my blog. But,  
what I found more alarming about the Rediff Search engine was the fact  
that it delivers XSS payloads from and does not encode output which it  
fetches from other website with the reflected XSS script.

Yes, when I visited the xssed site, I also came across several other  
pages with the vulnerability, but I found the search vulnerability to  
be quite serious because of the output encoding issue.

I also encountered the same response from their Customer Care. They  
dont seem to give a hoot.

Regards
Abhay

Hi Abhay!

    It's not new. It has been reported several times.


http://xssed.com/search?key=rediff
Here you can find all Rediff related XSSs. 

 

Even I had contacted Rediff's Technical Manager Salil Chaudhary and
submitted him the details too.

But when I saw the above link  http://xssed.com/search?key=rediff , I
got the idea how serious are they in dealing with the flaw. J

 

So I didn't follow up and today ,after 4 months of reporting, the status
is the same. Their every second Search module is flawed. But no use
reporting them again.

 

Rediff is full of vulnerability.

 

Following is the mail regarding my reporting to them:

---------

 

From: Salil [salilc at rediff.co.in]

To: Nilesh Kumar (India)

 

Thanks Nilesh. Appreciate the time taken by you to ship this our way.
Will have the team look into em.

Dear Salil,

 

     As discussed, please find Security Advisory Report for Rediff
attached here.

 

What suprised me was that yours is a world class Web site and yet the
vulnerabilities are quite simple to detect and that too on your home
page's 'Search' module.

Hope you will find it useful and informational.

In case of any queries just revert back to me.I will be glad to help you
out.

 

Waiting for your response.

Hi Nitin,

 

     I had contacted one guy Salil via LinkedIn --as you can't find a
single e-mail id on Rediff to contact for security incidents-told him
about the issue. He is Associate Director, Product Development in
Rediff. He accepted the invitation and gave his mail id '
salilc at rediff.co.in <mailto:salilc at rediff.co.in> ' to send the details.

This is Salil's profile 
http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=3457305

 

Later on I sent him the details in form of an advisory. If you want, can
send the same to you too. It reports XSS as well as 'Blind SQL
Injection' on their site.

 

Attached is the mail conversation with Salil.

This is what I reported to Rediff

 

Name: Abhay Bhargav

Phone Number: -

message : While I was using rediff search engine to research material for
cross site scripting and output encoding, i came across a security flaw in
the rediff search engine. It does not encode output properly and as a result
is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities which are stored in
different websites. Please get your developers to correct this soon as it is
a serious security flaw. Please contact me for any assistance in this
matter.

Hey recently a client wanted to know why would anyone refer to OWASP for guidelines to securing their web apps. The question was in the context of if the app is already ISO 27002 certified etc.

I created a simple one page PDF and shared with them. Might be useful in your organisations as well.

Feedback more than welcome.

The information has been taken from various sources online and the copyright only applies to presenting them in this manner. Feel free to use them anywhere and if you do quote me great but its ok otherwise as well. It was more for the client than anything else.

HI Arun,
  What you want to achieve after putting security in standalone application?

1.       Is there any internet communication from your application?

2.       OR do you connect to internet from that PC, where your application is running?

See if it is standalone PC and application, windows itself provides security mechanism so that no one can login and use your  application.
If you want to protect your application from spam other attacks, there are different ways to protect them.

Please do clarify more on your objectives and when you say a client, does it connect to server anywhere out of your local network or within local network ?

Thanks
Sandeep Gupta

Hi All

 

I am pleased to see that the Rediff Search XSS issue has been fixed.
Although I reported the issue to Rediff, I would like to thank some members
of OWASP Delhi for having taken the matter to a higher plane and reporting
it to someone who has been proactive. 

 

Unfortunately, several other Rediff sites are as vulnerable to XSS as ever.
I will probably go ahead and report this issue as well. Hopefully it gets
sorted out as quickly as the previous one.

Hi,

It is recommended to check for Security vulnerabilities even if the machine
hosting the application is not connected to any network. It would not
ascertain you that 'the user' would not perform any malicious activity to
your application in spite of the fact that the application is to be used by
the legitimate users only. You can check for issues like BoFs, Information
Disclosure, R.E. of the application, Input validation etc.

Also, you can run a tool called TCP Relay which is a proxy for the TCP
traffic, the same way as an HTTP proxy intercepts the HTTP traffic. Capture
the TCP traffic and see if it reveals any information. Moreover, try
decompiling your application if you have a little bit knowledge of the
language it is built in. Try fuzzing different entry/exit points of the
application. There are a lot of fuzzers available depending on the type of
application you are using. Last but not the least try reading the primary
memory of the host at different times while using the application so to
check for any sensitive information.

Hope that helps.

-Gunwant

           Sorry, still not fixed completely. Even on main page itself it is restricting scripts in simple form .but not encoded ones. ;)

   Apart from this every second search module is suffering like Product search, Shopping, Matcmaker, Astrology, Jobs endless.

   Wherever is search module..high chance of vulnerability.

   

  Abhay, main page search engine might be executing only encoded ones, but search modules on other pages still happily executing normal scripts. J

   

  Just an eyewash J from Rediff.

  That's great!

   

  Thanks a lot Nitin for your initiatives!

  It only led to getting mail from one Rediff Authority to me that issue will be solved soon, referring my report sent to them couple of months back. Now fixed.

   

  Abhay, good job done!

  Hi All

   

  I am pleased to see that the Rediff Search XSS issue has been fixed. Although I reported the issue to Rediff, I would like to thank some members of OWASP Delhi for having taken the matter to a higher plane and reporting it to someone who has been proactive. 

   

  Unfortunately, several other Rediff sites are as vulnerable to XSS as ever. I will probably go ahead and report this issue as well. Hopefully it gets sorted out as quickly as the previous one.

Sure, at present i had escalated this to some of their senior management. If required we will collate our efforts as Delhi OWASPians to get this corrected.

If there are any more such escalations to be made in this or other context's do let me know, will make it a representation to designated authorities.

  You are right Nitin. 
  Rediff, I'm told,  is actually perfoming an assessment of things they need to fix on all their web presence and also fixing them as they go along. If any of you have a report on other issues on that site, pass it along & I can forward it to someone who is corrdinating these XSS's to be fixed. Nitin, Abyaha and Nilesh are already marked on my previous communication to that person.

  Cheers/Sri

             Sorry, still not fixed completely. Even on main page itself it is restricting scripts in simple form .but not encoded ones. ;)

     Apart from this every second search module is suffering like Product search, Shopping, Matcmaker, Astrology, Jobs endless.

     Wherever is search module..high chance of vulnerability.

     

    Abhay, main page search engine might be executing only encoded ones, but search modules on other pages still happily executing normal scripts. J

     

    Just an eyewash J from Rediff.

Right Surendra

 

I hadn't tested with the escape() encoding. Looks like the folks at Rediff
are just doing some poor filtering like the unencoded "<>"s. Looks like I
praised them too soon. L

 

Anyway, this is just one of them. XSS issues are all over the Rediff sites.

Hi,

It is recommended to check for Security vulnerabilities even if the machine hosting the application is not connected to any network. It would not ascertain you that 'the user' would not perform any malicious activity to your application in spite of the fact that the application is to be used by the legitimate users only. You can check for issues like BoFs, Information Disclosure, R.E. of the application, Input validation etc.

Also, you can run a tool called TCP Relay which is a proxy for the TCP traffic, the same way as an HTTP proxy intercepts the HTTP traffic. Capture the TCP traffic and see if it reveals any information. Moreover, try decompiling your application if you have a little bit knowledge of the language it is built in. Try fuzzing different entry/exit points of the application. There are a lot of fuzzers available depending on the type of application you are using. Last but not the least try reading the primary memory of the host at different times while using the application so to check for any sensitive information.

Hope that helps.

HI Arun,

  What you want to achieve after putting security in standalone application?

1.       Is there any internet communication from your application?

2.       OR do you connect to internet from that PC, where your application is running?



See if it is standalone PC and application, windows itself provides security mechanism so that no one can login and use your  application.

If you want to protect your application from spam other attacks, there are different ways to protect them.



Please do clarify more on your objectives and when you say a client, does it connect to server anywhere out of your local network or within local network ?



Thanks

Hi Folks,



I've been trying to find out ways of performing security assessment of stand-alone windows-based client applications. But I couldn't get any lead on that.



It would be of great help, if anyone in this distro has any knowledge or prior experience in that area. Please throw some light on security assessment of stand-alone client applications.

That's great!

 

Thanks a lot Nitin for your initiatives!

It only led to getting mail from one Rediff Authority to me that issue
will be solved soon, referring my report sent to them couple of months
back. Now fixed.

 

Abhay, good job done!

Hi All

 

I am pleased to see that the Rediff Search XSS issue has been fixed.
Although I reported the issue to Rediff, I would like to thank some
members of OWASP Delhi for having taken the matter to a higher plane and
reporting it to someone who has been proactive. 

 

Unfortunately, several other Rediff sites are as vulnerable to XSS as
ever. I will probably go ahead and report this issue as well. Hopefully
it gets sorted out as quickly as the previous one.

         Sorry, still not fixed completely. Even on main page itself it
is restricting scripts in simple form ...but not encoded ones. ;)

 Apart from this every second search module is suffering like Product
search, Shopping, Matcmaker, Astrology, Jobs endless.

 Wherever is search module..high chance of vulnerability.

 

Abhay, main page search engine might be executing only encoded ones, but
search modules on other pages still happily executing normal scripts. J

 

Just an eyewash J from Rediff.

You are right Nitin. 
Rediff, I'm told,  is actually perfoming an assessment of things they
need to fix on all their web presence and also fixing them as they go
along. If any of you have a report on other issues on that site, pass it
along & I can forward it to someone who is corrdinating these XSS's to
be fixed. Nitin, Abyaha and Nilesh are already marked on my previous
communication to that person.
 
Cheers/Sri

   My report sent them already contains few pages mainly on 'ishare' which
are susceptible to blind SQL injection. Which can be used to retrieve
critical information from site using true/false conditions. However I am not
sure those sort URLs still exist or not on the site.

As discussed previously, it is quite evident that several of their  
sites are susceptible to Cross Site Scripting and other issues. I have  
written to them twice already. But their response has not yet arrived.

Message-ID: <f162ba540905290923i24091a4cmfd6e0ee355e7c507@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Kindly elaborate how can you be sure that a parameter "txtsearch" within the
belowmentioned URL is free from Reflected XSS issue.

http:///mybank.com/search.aspx?txtsearch=<script>alert('xss')</script>

-> After sending the above request what is to be seen in the source of
the resopnse if the application is performing the Output Escaping.

-> How do you check that the Output Escaping done by the application is
proper and up to the mark and will not allow any XSS issue.

 I mean how do conclude that there is no XSS as entering some varients of
scripts will work and some of them does not work.
