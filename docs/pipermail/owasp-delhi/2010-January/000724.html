@Atul,
For CERT-In, it is not about the method but the process an organisation follows. 
pdf process might seems to you as KISS (keep it simple stupid) but follows the government instructions where a national security agency (CERT-In) has to keep records of the reporting person and subsequently the action taken on the reported incidents. 
As a fact, in India a normal user or even professionals are still not using their digital identities (like digital certificates or keys). Then how the authenticity of the reported person will be established? On which basis a national security agency will take action? 
I just co-relate with a business process of a bank. Why do you need to fill Pay-in-slip form for any deposits u make for ur account? It's in same way....
However filling pdf form is not mandatory and CERT-In acts on reports received on e-mail (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-delhi">incident at cert-in.org.in</A>). 
Regards,MADHUR VERMA

@Parmendra.
Sounds good.
Still i hope we have someone here in the list who can explain me why a pdf and why not a webform. KISS (keep it simple stupid) method always and everywhere works better in my opinion.

Hi Atul,
 
For any further incident report them at the given id it will definately work.

Fill the form once they ask you to do so but in such cases they will never ask it is because such kind of incidents are their primary concerns. Form filling is required to have the additional details regarding the incident reporting party as well as the type of the reported incident but in this case the picture is clear.

@Parmendra
I have mailed them.I have allready done that but i really dont have patince to download I just hate there way/method who has got so much patience to download the form and then fill it up?



I wonder why can`t they come up with nice web-form for registering the incident.this is just overdo and we are doing it for a common cause.its more like adding pain rather than submitting incidence.

Dear All,
 
May please report any phishing incident related to any Indian bank to Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) for the quick removal / deactivation of the phishing website. 



 
Together with this you may also report any incident related to Malware Infection or something which seems to be a threat to Information Security.
 
This is because CERT-In coordinates with the ISPs and Other National CERTs and Indian Constituencies for the quick eradication of the reported Incidents so that the loss can be minimised.



 
Details required for the Incident Reporting are given below:
 
E-mail ID:  <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-delhi">incident at cert-in.org.in</A>
Incident Response Help Desk phone: +91-11-24368572 
Fax : +91-1800-11-6969

Morning all,
Well moments ago saw this mail and its not marked as spam a crafted e-mail.
I tried my best to contact PNB guys but unfortunately there was no link for phishing report on website of PNB.



I am sure more than 100 customers must have been fooled so far submitting there credit card PIN.
I have attached screenshot alongwith.
