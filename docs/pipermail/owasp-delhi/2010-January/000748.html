<PRE>Hi Dhruv,
 
thnk for the update. I am amazed and it is a learning on how the Chinese have a very strong &quot;content filtering firewall&quot; and much less vulnerable than anyone else. Not sure if this is the right fora, but the key proactive and predictive strategy would come with ISP's in India taking a lead and actively involved in a larger security policy framework, cert-in can be mostly a facilitator.

Hi Sanjay and Muslim,

 

As we know, Russians are more known for cyber mafia infrastructure and RBN economics which was used just as a gateway here and I clarified this in my last email as well. Media is doing their best job in trying to cook more over it to make it appear that their channel has got the accurate news and others don't. Below are some more links to press coverage:

The only thing investigators found later, this attack was not limited to just 32 officials as has been highlighted in almost every news channel or newspaper so far. Rather, the attack was carried out against not 100 or 200 but more than 450+ key govt. officials. Upcoming news reports might have this update.

 

I agree to your point Sanjay and I would say if we don't build up a mutli-pronged cyber security policy in the interest of national security today, it would be too late. This particular attack raised the eyebrows of many govt. officials and is directly being briefed to NSA, so all officials involved are equally concerned. Attack used a 0-day vulnerability and an already compromised account which could have been carried out against any individual or country undetected through security devices/antivirus software. The best thing which I appreciate and congratulated the investigators that this time we were better equipped to handle the situation. Better means, better than even what US cyber security teams might have done.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Dhruv,

 

Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and co-ordinated effort.

Why can we not build our own army to counter attack or we are only here to make money in $  and proud ourself to work in reputed MNCs.

As stated in the news clipping as well, key govt. functionaries like Deputy NSA, Climate Change Envoy were compromised so it was a real serious attack. But damage containment started in just a few minutes after the incident. I know the patriotic zeal of these people and we should be proud of them.

What was the severity of the data compromised? Were anyting substantial lost?

This incident is quite significant to start a new thread so that people who might not have noticed in earlier post can also know and comment. I am indirectly in touch with the investigators who are behind this commendable job. They were part of the OWASP conference and most likely known to participants who were there. This is the first time that govt. of India had the will, candour and the tenacity to respond to such a situation.
