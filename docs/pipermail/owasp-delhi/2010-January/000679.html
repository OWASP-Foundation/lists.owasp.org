andsoftware vendors sites

 

There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months.
Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days
that helps malware hop from one machine to another with its payload
which most of the times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites
like Twitter and Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to
carry targeted attacks. Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010
Threat prediction:

Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability
and detailed report has been published here:

ried-out-against-few-sensitive-email-accounts-belonging-to-elite-custome
r-of-torrid.html 

 

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all
their employees while using social networking portals which I think
makes lot of sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there
something similar happening at your organization as well? 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv
