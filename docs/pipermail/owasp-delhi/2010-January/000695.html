<PRE>Hi Akhilesh,

 

I want share something on this, Email circulation on regular basis makes
more attention to users to take necessary action. As per your suggestion
monthly basis circulation , sometime avoided by the users to have bulk
links/information/news in a single mail.

 

Thanks &amp; Regards,

Kumar Priya

It is also advised that Major threats and Corrective actions as
observed shall be shared quickly for incidents faced by the
Organizations. 

But discussion sharing on code threats and details may be informative
for action by some, therefore it can be planned for circulation on
monthly basis. 

Even on monthly basis the hyperlinks with the subject /item topic may be
circulated, so that area of interest can be viewed as per the
requirement. 

Else we are already receiving Emails from OWASP, either with thanks ,
good report, views , suggestion, etc.

I agree with Chintan.

Posting links related to major attacks are OK but turning out mailing
list into 'News Board' is not a good idea.....  ;)

ADVISE : SME Must Do Online Banking from Dedicated Computers 

US FBI and the American Bankers Association recommend using dedicated
computers for online banking 

By Lucian Constantin, Web News Editor 

4 January 2010

nking-from-Dedicated-Computers-131086.shtml 

Following a flurry of incidents where hundreds of thousands of dollars
have been siphoned from the bank accounts of small businesses and public
institutions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the American
Bankers Association (ABA) advise using dedicated computers for online
banking operations. This unusual security model should severely limit
the exposure to malware threats for the PCs in question. 

The level of Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers fraud rose
significantly during last year prompting serious concerns from the
authorities. These fraudulent schemes are complex and usually leave
little evidence behind to help investigators or the victims looking to
recover their losses. 

Such attacks usually start with a computer trojan infecting a computer
used for online banking at an institution. Thousands of different
versions of these trojans are released every month in order to bypass
the detection mechanisms of antivirus software. 

Once on the computer, the malware watches for browsing sessions to known
online banking websites and information such as authentication
credentials or account balance is captured. Subsequently, the attackers
direct the trojan to initiate batches of fraudulent transfers to bank
accounts belonging to various U.S. residents that have been tricked to
work for them. 

The latter are known as &quot;money mules&quot; and are usually recruited by fake
foreign companies under the promise of a profitable work-from-home job.
Their task is to receive money allegedly coming from customers of the
company and wire them out of the country, while keeping a commission for
themselves. 

Unfortunately for companies, they are not protected by the same laws as
general consumers. While banks will reimburse the losses caused by fraud
when personal accounts are involved, they are not required to do so for
business accounts. They can recall transfers as long as the money has
not been withdrawn and wired, but if the later happens, it is almost
certainly lost. 

USA Today reports that the feds' recommendation regarding the use of a
dedicated PC for online tasks is based on reducing possible infection
vectors, since apparently browsing to unrelated websites or checking
email from it should be banned. The companies are also advised to
request receiving out of bank payment confirmation. 

We'll go even further and suggest that the dedicated computer use Linux,
FreeBSD, or even Mac OS X, if that suits you better. We're not trying to
start a controversy over which operating system is better or more
secure. In fact, this has nothing to do with the security of the
operating system itself, but the fact that 99.9% of these trojans were
constructed for Windows and will fail to run on anything else. 

The easiest approach is downloading a Linux live CD, booting from it,
performing the online banking tasks, then removing it and restarting
back into Windows. Need to open an excel spreadsheet, browse, check
email or access a network storage? The Ubuntu Linux live CD will allow
you to run Firefox, OpenOffice and perform most of the basic tasks
without installing anything on the local disk.
