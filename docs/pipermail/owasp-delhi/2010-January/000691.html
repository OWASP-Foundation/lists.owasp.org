&gt;<i>     *ADVISE : SME Must Do Online Banking from Dedicated Computers*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *US** FBI and the American Bankers Association recommend using dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> computers for online banking *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By Lucian Constantin, Web News Editor
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4 January 2010
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Small-Businesses-Should-Conduct-Online-Banking-from-Dedicated-Computers-131086.shtml">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Small-Businesses-Should-Conduct-Online-Banking-from-Dedicated-Computers-131086.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Following a flurry of incidents where hundreds of thousands of dollars have
</I>&gt;<i> been siphoned from the bank accounts of small businesses and public
</I>&gt;<i> institutions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the American
</I>&gt;<i> Bankers Association (ABA) advise using dedicated computers for online
</I>&gt;<i> banking operations. This unusual security model should severely limit the
</I>&gt;<i> exposure to malware threats for the PCs in question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The level of Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers fraud rose
</I>&gt;<i> significantly during last year prompting serious concerns from the
</I>&gt;<i> authorities. These fraudulent schemes are complex and usually leave little
</I>&gt;<i> evidence behind to help investigators or the victims looking to recover
</I>&gt;<i> their losses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Such attacks usually start with a computer trojan infecting a computer used
</I>&gt;<i> for online banking at an institution. Thousands of different versions of
</I>&gt;<i> these trojans are released every month in order to bypass the detection
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms of antivirus software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once on the computer, the malware watches for browsing sessions to known
</I>&gt;<i> online banking websites and information such as authentication credentials
</I>&gt;<i> or account balance is captured. Subsequently, the attackers direct the
</I>&gt;<i> trojan to initiate batches of fraudulent transfers to bank accounts
</I>&gt;<i> belonging to various U.S. residents that have been tricked to work for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The latter are known as &quot;money mules&quot; and are usually recruited by fake
</I>&gt;<i> foreign companies under the promise of a profitable work-from-home job.
</I>&gt;<i> Their task is to receive money allegedly coming from customers of the
</I>&gt;<i> company and wire them out of the country, while keeping a commission for
</I>&gt;<i> themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately for companies, they are not protected by the same laws as
</I>&gt;<i> general consumers. While banks will reimburse the losses caused by fraud
</I>&gt;<i> when personal accounts are involved, they are not required to do so for
</I>&gt;<i> business accounts. They can recall transfers as long as the money has not
</I>&gt;<i> been withdrawn and wired, but if the later happens, it is almost certainly
</I>&gt;<i> lost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> USA Today reports that the feds' recommendation regarding the use of a
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated PC for online tasks is based on reducing possible infection
</I>&gt;<i> vectors, since apparently browsing to unrelated websites or checking email
</I>&gt;<i> from it should be banned. The companies are also advised to request
</I>&gt;<i> receiving out of bank payment confirmation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll go even further and suggest that the dedicated computer use Linux,
</I>&gt;<i> FreeBSD, or even Mac OS X, if that suits you better. We're not trying to
</I>&gt;<i> start a controversy over which operating system is better or more secure. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact, this has nothing to do with the security of the operating system
</I>&gt;<i> itself, but the fact that 99.9% of these trojans were constructed for
</I>&gt;<i> Windows and will fail to run on anything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The easiest approach is downloading a Linux live CD, booting from it,
</I>&gt;<i> performing the online banking tasks, then removing it and restarting back
</I>&gt;<i> into Windows. Need to open an excel spreadsheet, browse, check email or
</I>&gt;<i> access a network storage? The Ubuntu Linux live CD will allow you to run
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox, OpenOffice and perform most of the basic tasks without installing
</I>&gt;<i> anything on the local disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
