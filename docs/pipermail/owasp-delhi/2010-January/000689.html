<PRE>Hi,

Adobe's implementation of Javascript in PDF documents, referred to as Acrobat JavaScript&lt;<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/Acro6JSGuide.pdf">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/Acro6JSGuide.pdf</A>&gt;, appears to have been originally introduced based on the popularity of PDF eForms. Javascript allows for some dynamic behaviors in PDF's, including calculations, responses to user actions, user data validation, and the integration of other dynamic capabilities.

That said, for many users PDF's are simply a mechanism for providing documents to read. Given the spate of vulnerabilities identified in Acrobat and Reader in 2009, and the likely promise of more in 2010, an advisable approach, depending on your usage of these products, may be to disable Javascript and only re-enable when performing an activity with a PDF that requires Javascript be enabled, such as with an eForm.

Adobe notes that disabling Javascript mitigates against exploits identified this year that use Javascript functions to cause a memory corruption, although in some cases it would be possible to create variants that do not rely on Javascript. To disable Javascript in Adobe Reader or Acrobat: select Edit &gt; Preferences, select the JavaScript option on the left, and uncheck the Enable Acrobat JavaScript option

Forgot to state: I love Chinese. They negotiated  with M$ to get the entire source code for the products and then found the ways to secure and insecure.

Appreciate your comments. Here is another detailed analysis if you would like to go for Adobe: <A HREF="http://extraexploit.blogspot.com/2009/12/adobe-cve-2009-4324-in-wild-0day-part_1766.html">http://extraexploit.blogspot.com/2009/12/adobe-cve-2009-4324-in-wild-0day-part_1766.html</A>

I think their patch is still awaited so leverage it, if this is indeed the case.

Embedded objects shall remain a problem forever for MS/Adobe/Followers.

Despite the fact that the majority of malware exploits use JavaScript to trigger an attack in Adobe's PDF Reader product, the company says it's impossible to completely remove JavaScript support without causing major compatibility problems.

Read the detail from

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] More attackers targeting Social Networking and software vendors sites

There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months. Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in Microsoft Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days that helps malware hop from one machine to another with its payload which most of the times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites like Twitter and Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to carry targeted attacks. Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010 Threat prediction: <A HREF="http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_predict_1209_v2.pdf">http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_predict_1209_v2.pdf</A>

Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability and detailed report has been published here: <A HREF="http://torridnetworks.com/index.php/case-studies/50-information-security/139-malware-analysis-report-for-a-targeted-attack-via-word-document-carried-out-against-few-sensitive-email-accounts-belonging-to-elite-customer-of-torrid.html">http://torridnetworks.com/index.php/case-studies/50-information-security/139-malware-analysis-report-for-a-targeted-attack-via-word-document-carried-out-against-few-sensitive-email-accounts-belonging-to-elite-customer-of-torrid.html</A>

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all their employees while using social networking portals which I think makes lot of sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there something similar happening at your organization as well?

Many Thanks,
Dhruv
