<PRE>Oops! PNB officials are already on the list. Though I forwarded to him directly with Cc to GM IT. Some action is hopeful.

 

By the way, The phishing form redirects to pnbindia.com. So it not only collects the credit card numbers but also compromise the victim through drive-by-download method which seems to be taken off at the moment.

I wonder how come a government/nationalized bank can have such poor security for online transaction.I was unable to see the pages correctly on firefox as that is the only browser i have apart from this the portal has no secure signing authority like verisign or thawte.

This is simply unacceptable.Lots of poor peoples account are unsafe.We know rthe trick so we are safe what about others.
The worst part is one of  the contct-us page mail id bounces back.

Wow! Just to add further:

 

Watch for:

 

pnbindia.com

pnbindia.in

 

Can you see the difference? Dig and whois can be helpful and this link can add more: <A HREF="http://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=pnbindia.com.">http://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=pnbindia.com.</A> Though, Infected links seem to have removed.

 

I have got some good links in PNB, let me help them out with this. 

 

Phish the Fish! ;-)

Morning all,
Well moments ago saw this mail and its not marked as spam a crafted e-mail.
I tried my best to contact PNB guys but unfortunately there was no link for phishing report on website of PNB.
I am sure more than 100 customers must have been fooled so far submitting there credit card PIN.
I have attached screenshot alongwith.
