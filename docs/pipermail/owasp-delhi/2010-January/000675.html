<PRE>There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months.
Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days that helps
malware hop from one machine to another with its payload which most of the
times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites like Twitter and
Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to carry targeted attacks.
Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010 Threat prediction:

Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability and
detailed report has been published here:

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all their
employees while using social networking portals which I think makes lot of
sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there something similar
happening at your organization as well? 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv
