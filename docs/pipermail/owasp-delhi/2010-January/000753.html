<PRE>M,

I agree with your viewpoint. It's the strong &quot;will&quot; of the red which made
averyone bow down.

Hi Sanjay,

I don&#8217;t think ISP&#8217;s in India can take lead on this, Chinese are successful
in doing this because of strong will of Govt. In handling these issues. In
India where most of the things are at the hands of Private players its
becomes very difficult to implement these solutions. Especially because if
the Bureaucratic &#160;&#160;process in the govt. People will only look for ways out
even if such ordinance in passed by government and it will take years to
implement them and that will also be non-effective implementation.

I anyone can take lead on this, it has to be government who will have to
take care of things from start to end, just passing an order and making
mandatory for ISPs to have these solutions will help.

Hi Dhruv,

thnk for the update. I am amazed and it is a learning on how the Chinese
have a very strong &quot;content filtering firewall&quot; and much less vulnerable
than anyone else. Not sure if this is the right fora, but the key proactive
and predictive strategy would come with ISP's in India taking a lead and
actively involved in a larger security policy framework, cert-in can be
mostly a facilitator.

Hi Sanjay and Muslim,

As we know, Russians are more known for cyber mafia infrastructure and RBN
economics which was used just as a gateway here and I clarified this in my
last email as well. Media is doing their best job in trying to cook more
over it to make it appear that their channel has got the accurate news and
others don&#8217;t. Below are some more links to press coverage:

The only thing investigators found later, this attack was not limited to
just 32 officials as has been highlighted in almost every news channel or
newspaper so far. Rather, the attack was carried out against not 100 or 200
but more than 450+ key govt. officials. Upcoming news reports might have
this update.

I agree to your point Sanjay and I would say if we don&#8217;t build up a
mutli-pronged cyber security policy in the interest of national security
today, it would be too late. This particular attack raised the eyebrows of
many govt. officials and is directly being briefed to NSA, so all officials
involved are equally concerned. Attack used a 0-day vulnerability and an
already compromised account which could have been carried out against any
individual or country undetected through security devices/antivirus
software. The best thing which I appreciate and congratulated the
investigators that this time we were better equipped to handle the
situation. Better means, better than even what US cyber security teams
might have done.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Dhruv,

Since you are in touch with the investigators, how much truth is behind the
Russian hackers. Also believe you can play a role for a more proactive and
predictive cert-in involvement, India online industry is in nascent stage
and these are early signs for a requirement of more collective and
co-ordinated effort.

 As stated in the news clipping as well, key govt. functionaries like       
 Deputy NSA, Climate Change Envoy were compromised so it was a real serious 
 attack. But damage containment started in just a few minutes after the     
 incident. I know the patriotic zeal of these people and we should be proud 
 of them.

 This incident is quite significant to start a new thread so that people    
 who might not have noticed in earlier post can also know and comment. I am 
 indirectly in touch with the investigators who are behind this commendable 
 job. They were part of the OWASP conference and most likely known to       
 participants who were there. This is the first time that govt. of India    
 had the will, candour and the tenacity to respond to such a situation.
