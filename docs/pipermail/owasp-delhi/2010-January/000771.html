<PRE>Hey,

Today I got a call +92 # from HDFC, caller confirmed my name and phone number and then asking if I received my check book from the bank. I played along and said Yes. 2nd question: So this month how much are you expecting your salary amount? I played along. 3rd Q: can you please confirm your last 4 digit of your credit card #? I played along. 4th Q: Can you confirm your address please. By this time, I exhausted my patience. Asked him why is he alling, gave a piece of my mind. By then he started stammering and quickly changed to a topic - Sir we are giving a free life time credit card ...  
I ended the call by giving him the choicest of adjectives I knew ...

So guys beware ...

Regards,


Bishwaroop H

 

Regards!
Bishwaroop

..BTW I got a call from a +92 num claiming they were from airtel and asking for my home address. 

What got me suspicious was not that it was from Pak but that your phone provider has your address and will never ask for it!

If it was a leak from airtel DB the addresses would have been leaked too; which doesn't seem to be the case.

I reported it to the police; they came to my house and noted it but sadly they did not recognize it a threat to national security. One day we all are going to pay the price for the apathy that prevails in our culture.

Am wondering if we can form a central body, org that can handle such reports and setup task force to counter act!?!
