<PRE>Hi,

I hope group members would like to know the State of Data Security and Privacy in the Indian Industry. On page no 33, you'll get the survey results on &quot;PROMINENT TRENDS IN APPLICATION SECURITY INITIATIVES&quot;.

Data Security Council of India has released the report of the recently conducted Survey on Data Security and Privacy. The survey was conducted by DSCI through KPMG, in association with CERT-In, under the Cyber Security Awareness Project sponsored by DIT, MCIT, Govt. of India. The survey covered 153 leading companies from sectors including Banking &amp; Financial Services, Manufacturing, E-Commerce, IT &amp; ITES, Telecom, and PSUs.


The objective of Data Security survey was to:



1.      Assess the importance given to information security and data privacy

2.      Capture the leading practices and/or standards adopted for Information Security and Data Privacy in organizations

3.      Identify the major sources of data leakage, compromising of data privacy, in organizations

4.      Study the status of Information and Physical Security Convergence.

5.      Awareness about the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008, and interface with Cert-In when incidents happen



You can view or download the survey report from the following link: <A HREF="http://www.dsci.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=95.">http://www.dsci.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=95.</A>
