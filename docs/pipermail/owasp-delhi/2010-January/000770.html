<PRE>..BTW I got a call from a +92 num claiming they were from airtel and asking for my home address. 

What got me suspicious was not that it was from Pak but that your phone provider has your address and will never ask for it!

If it was a leak from airtel DB the addresses would have been leaked too; which doesn't seem to be the case.

I reported it to the police; they came to my house and noted it but sadly they did not recognize it a threat to national security. One day we all are going to pay the price for the apathy that prevails in our culture.

Am wondering if we can form a central body, org that can handle such reports and setup task force to counter act!?!
