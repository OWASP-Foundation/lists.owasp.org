<PRE>Appreciate your comments. Here is another detailed analysis if you would
like to go for Adobe:
<A HREF="http://extraexploit.blogspot.com/2009/12/adobe-cve-2009-4324-in-wild-0day-pa">http://extraexploit.blogspot.com/2009/12/adobe-cve-2009-4324-in-wild-0day-pa</A>
rt_1766.html

 

I think their patch is still awaited so leverage it, if this is indeed the
case. 

 

Embedded objects shall remain a problem forever for MS/Adobe/Followers.

Despite the fact that the majority of malware exploits use JavaScript to
trigger an attack in Adobe's PDF Reader product, the company says it's
impossible to completely remove JavaScript support without causing major
compatibility problems.

There has been massive increase in targeted attacks in last few months.
Malware writers prefer to infect victims using vulnerabilities in Microsoft
Products and Adobe. There has been increase in MS/Adobe 0-days that helps
malware hop from one machine to another with its payload which most of the
times reports to a botnet. Social networking websites like Twitter and
Facebook are becoming prime source for attackers to carry targeted attacks.
Recently Mcafee published a report on 2010 Threat prediction:
<A HREF="http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_pred">http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/7985rpt_labs_threat_pred</A>
ict_1209_v2.pdf 

 

Recently, we also found similar mass attack using MS Word vulnerability and
detailed report has been published here:

Also, many corporate are coming up with social media policy for all their
employees while using social networking portals which I think makes lot of
sense to protect corporate from identity theft. Is there something similar
happening at your organization as well? 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv
