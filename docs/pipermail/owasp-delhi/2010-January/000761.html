<PRE>I just wanted to share with you that there is a massive scam being operated
from Pakistan. Under this scam, you will receive a missed call (single ring)
from Pakistani number (+92 country code). If you call back they will state
that they tried to reach you and are from Airtel. If you question that
number is international they will say Airtel has got many global campaigning
numbers and reason for the call is that you won 2,00,000 Rs. from a lucky
draw at Airtel. To claim the prize you need to recharge your mobile (If
prepaid) by telling the PIN number of your debit/credit card and same for
advance post-paid payment.

 

Same scam was carried against Dubai based telecom company called Etisalat
and is now launched against Airtel in India. Reports claims that there has
been theft of subscribers information from Airtel that has facilitated this
scam.

 

Its been 4rth missed call to my mobile but before I would have called back,
luckily I found their traces over the internet. Search on google with
keyword &quot;Missed calls from Pakistan&quot; to know more about this scam. 

 

Do inform your family, friends, contacts about this scam because everyone
might not be an Indian InfoSec Warrior J
