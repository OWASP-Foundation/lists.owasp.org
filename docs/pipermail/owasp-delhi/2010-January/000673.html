Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Proxy servers

 

Hello Everyone,

 

Happy New Year 2010!

 

Does anyone know how one can identify free proxy servers (HTTP/HTTPS) located in other countries. I'm particularly looking for the following countries:

 

Cuba, Syria, Sudan, Iran and North Korea (Fat chance, but still...). 

 

I've already tried Googling for these and found sites like aliveproxy.com and proxyswitcher.com. While the former site lists the proxies from Sudan, Iran and Syria, these proxies are inactive and therefore, inaccessible. The latter site provides a tool that facilitates an anonymity network, but this tool does not list any proxy from the countries i mentioned above (except Iran).

 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks in advance!

Harish
