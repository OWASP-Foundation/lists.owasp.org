<PRE>Dear Vaibhav,

I really appreciate your efforts and learning approach, Keep it up!!!

Regarding WebApp/Network Security companies, You can take reference from Cert-In ( <A HREF="http://www.cert-in.org.in/security-auditors.htm">http://www.cert-in.org.in/security-auditors.htm</A>) and some googling will help you in making complete database. You can use database for your current purpose. I wish I could tell you some specific companies name but I don't have any idea how many companies are currently offering internship programs on App/Net security (I heard only paid training programs on appsec and netsec so far).

Let's wait, if any other group member has any idea on this.

All the best!!!

Regards
Suman

Good Evenining all

A very Happy New Year to all the OWASP delhi members.

I am a B.Tech student of 6th sem (3rd year) in Computer Science stream. i have to opt for 2 months internship after my 6th sem i.e in coming June-July. I am keenly interested in having my intership in Web application security or Network security. I have a fair knowledge about web app security(SQL,XSS,Session handling etc),reverse engineering,basic networking and have practised my skills to some extent on HACKMEs, CRACKMEs, WEBGOAT etc.

Can anyone please suggest me some of the companies i can apply to for my interships in WebApp/Network Security field.

Any suggestions regarding the issue are highly appreciated.

Thanks in anticipation
Vaibhav Gupta
