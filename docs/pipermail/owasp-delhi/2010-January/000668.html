Published

 

The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) is pleased to announce the
long awaited release of the WASC 

Threat Classification v2.0. The Threat Classification is an effort to
classify the weaknesses, and attacks 

that can lead to the compromise of a website, its data, or its users. This
document's primarily purpose is 

to serve as a reference guide for common attacks and weaknesses.

 

Main goals

- Refine document scope, terminology, and purpose

- Update existing sections when applicable

- Add missing attacks and weaknesses

- Creation of a firm, scalable base foundation allowing for the introduction
of data views allowing for various 

  forms of data representation

- Addition of attack and weakness reference identifiers (WASC-&lt;xx&gt;)

- Publication of two data views
