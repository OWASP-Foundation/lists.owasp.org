Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] Early Registration Ending Soon: 2nd US OWASP AppSec Conference - Oct 11-12 - Near DC
Message-ID: <000001c5b267$e013d960$c35cfea9@kulwant>

Hi All,

I just wanted to remind everyone that early registration for the OWASP
conference ends on Sept 9th (this Friday). On Sept 10 the registration
fee will increase by $50 for both Standard and Government registrants.
Full details on the conference are available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc.html

Also, I have been informed by the staff at NIST that there will be NO
ONSITE REGISTRATION. Thus, you must register for the conference by Oct
10th via the website. We then have to provide a list of registrants to
the Guards at
NIST. You will be required to provide them with picture ID. If you are
on
the registration list, they will then let you enter the facility to the
conference building where you can pick up your conference badge.

Also, the training class on Oct 10, the day before the conference, is
almost full so I encourage anyone interested in signing up to do so
soon. If there are enough registrants over the course max, we might open
up a second
offering of the class at the same date and location. However, we need to
decide this soon so we can reserve the room. So please register for the
course as soon as possible if you are interested to ensure you get a
spot.

Registration info from previous announcements repeated below:

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a non-profit charitable organization, and with
NIST's sponsorship, OWASP has been able to keep the cost to $300 per 
seat if you are able to register prior to Sept. 10, 2005. The cost to
government employees is only $250 prior to Sept. 10th.

Registration information is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/docroot/owasp/Registration/index.jsp

PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL TICKETS ARE NON REFUNDABLE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATION
COSTS

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE - Oct 10: OWASP has arranged 
to
have a one-day hands on Web Application Security training course the day
prior to the conference. This one day class will be held at the nearby
Holiday Inn and is only $600 for conference attendees. Registration for 
this
course can be done via the conference registration page.

More details on this training course is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc/training.html

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - Oct 11: An optional dinner event is being held at

the
Holiday Inn Gaithersburg, which is the same location where the training 
is
to be held on the 10th, and where discounted rooms are being made 
available
to all conference attendees (see Accommodations below).

This event involves a dinner at the hotel from 7-9 PM, followed by 
drinks at
O'Malley's Irish Pub right in the hotel or out by the hotel's indoor 
pool
adjacent to the pub. We hope to see all of you there as this is a great
chance to mingle and meet many members of the OWASP community.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you all
there!

Thanks, Dave

Greetings All, 
Allow me to introduce you to the Delhi Chapter of OWASP. Although the
chapter was setup a few weeks ago, but some really hectic schedule
didn't leave me with much time to introduce ourselves to other OWASP
compatriots. Anyways, we are back on track and we have some really
exciting plans to leverage need of web application security in Delhi and
adjoining areas. In the same respect, we are trying to create a synergy
between various enthusiasts and OWASP, thus providing them a common
platform to share knowledge. We are thankful to all OWASP Samaritans who
have made this project as a benchmark of web application security.

Currently, I am leading an entrepreneurial security services start-up
called SigInt Network Defense. My previous background is in security
consulting, security product development and research.

PS: We have customized the OWASP logo to make one for the Delhi chapter.
Have a look :) (http://sigint.co.in/images/OWASP-Delhi.gif)

Hello,
Welcome to the OWASP community. I lead the Kolkata chapter of OWASP. Now
I guess we have a fairly large team in India. Kolkata, Bangalore,
Delhi,Mumbai, Hyderabad, kerala. As we are now into the major IT cities,
this is the right time i hope to?bring on the activities of OWASP at a
national level instead of being confined to regions. This is a call to
all other chapter leads in India to contribute their views on the same.
How about organising a conference/seminar ?? This is a pre-mature idea
but can be well executed with the feedback of other chapter leads in
India.
