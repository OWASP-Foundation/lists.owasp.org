Dear Dhruv & Tarun,
    I personally concur with the views expressed about the rotten lumpen
politicians(irrespective of their political affiliation) of our Great
Nation by both of you.
       However,I would like to add that its high time that we make our
highly corrupt and well entrenched Babus(bureaucrats)and
responsible Flag Officers/Senior Offices of Indian Navy, Coast
Guard, IB, RAW and State Police also accountable  for this shame on
our country and be shown the door immediately to drive home the
point that for a change we mean business.Also, let us not let
numerous self seeking so called Human Rights activists/NGOs &
Communists with doubtful integrity & loyalty dilute/hijack the
whole exercise of fortifying our nation's internal security set up.

Regards

Pravin Chauhan

Dear All
 
100% in agreement with Dhruv, Tarun and Pravin. All these politicians are 
not eligible for the job so they should be thrown out of the offices which ever 
portfolio they are holding.
 
They don't have a shame on their faces even after such a horrified attack. 
Our so called hon'able home minister of Maharashtra is saying that " This all 
happens in big cities" then why not he went to Taj or Trident and faced the 
bullets, why he was hiding at that time.
 
We should pery to GOD some time these terrorists should some and strike in 
these politicians house. 
 
Its shame on all of us also why we choose these as our leaders.
 
For every citizen killed in this attack, equal number of these politicians 
should be put in jail for not doing their duty honestly.
 
I would prey from GOD to save all of us from these currupt politicians and 
give us some honest leader who can rule this country with honesty.
 
Deepak Gupta

I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
here with believe that you guys won?t mind it!
 
Indian politicians are taking the civilians for granted and are very
much centric at their personal interests rather caring about interest of the
country. They are good at making unrealistic statements in media but no action
at all. I was in Delhi 
at the time of this attack on nation, but this particular incident has really
disturbed my deep feelings for my nation and is giving so disheartening feeling
of being an impotent and coward Indian who can be killed anytime on the roads
or in the suite of a 7 star hotel. No one can enter and open up fire just like
that in my home! I am 10000% sure, the current heat will go on for few more
days in Media and politicians will be under pressure. But when it will come to
action, it will be all hollow. Honorable prime minister has blamed Pakistan for
this, which is so lame and highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can
come from any part of the world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are
just terrorists. Who cares, if they were trained in Pakistan 
or in America ?
Point is, are we fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border
security and then internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and
building strong intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off
their hands by blaming any other country and must understand that "We are
weak from inside-out". Look at United States , one attack and they
just declared openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy
it! But wow! Welcome to India !
We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation for OBCs, Marathas rule
Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don?t care about the life of those
OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in our country. I won't be surprised
to see another attack in next few months in Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it.
It can just happen to anyone, except politicians! And they know it very well
that they are always going to be safe due to high personal security. I don't
see any GOD for these people who just don't perform their duties for which they
were elected by the civilians. 

Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for terrorists,
coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a miserable life.
There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people. Cut down their
sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them live a miserable
life in their own country. I am so angry on the way politicians of my country
operate and couldn?t really sleep from last 3 days or concentrate on my
work. May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to take birth in the country
that is always operated by incompetent and impotent politicians! Probably, our
politicians were never fed with their mother's breast milk and must have been
fed by some bitches on the street! That is why they have no love for their
nation! 

Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
single solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can bring
a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will, but I feel
they might) act on terrorism then... 


 
Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Dhruv,

 

I have different opinion on this. Politicians are responsible but Governments are primarily responsible for this.  Our politicians are not at all smart to drive INDIA on world map.

 

It is the team who are members of government i.e. IAS, IPS, and other government officials are having prime responsibility.

 

Let me put evidence for these points - "RAW, IB, MUMBAI POLICE & other security agencies chief and officers should counter each other on not acting upon the information. Media should also respond in positive direction like should ask Defense minister to public the report on the action taken on Information provided by various security agencies related to this BRUTAL ATTACK."

 

I feel corruption is the ROOT CAUSE of these attacks. Impact of corruption and its link of attack is as below:

1. Politician needs money to fight election.

2. Commissioned & other officers need money for better lifestyle & recognition.

3. Rich people want to rule world utilizing money.

4. Poor / Unemployed people need money for food and life and they become prime target of such opportunities.

 

No one can remove corruption. But yes physical security can be improved to have zero-effect of such attacks.

 

My ROOT suggestions for PHYSICAL SECURITY are:

1.      Install scanners on all public places instead of CCTV. These scanners should automatically send the signal / mail to all local, state level and central security agencies along with place and pictures.

2.      These scanners should be governed by Army police. 

3.      Defense Ministry should respond on these signal using different mediums newspaper, websites etc.

4.      There should be one Security Index like BSE, NIFTY which will present the exact value of security measures and effectiveness.

 

Media and other Intellectual society should present a plan to government on how we can improve this.

 

Our scientists should demand fund for and develop such scanners.

 

There are a lot of things which makes us (INDIA) vulnerable. We have to start from somewhere. Only blaming is not the solution. 

 

 

Regards,

Brij

Its not lack of intelligence, we have one billion pair of eyes here in
India watching every inch of our land. It is lack of processing
capability if even 1% of us were to turn into vigilantes, the
information would overload our 'system'( the government as described
by you) limited bandwidth to process it. Scanners without human
intelligence supporting them are useless. Even US failed process the
amount of digital information they possessed by processing it into
actionable intelligence in time to prevent the 9/11 attacks. There is
no alternative to actionable human intelligence.

But I don?t. Teams are driven by leaders. If leader will go to sleep, he
won?t find productivity from the team. It starts from Prime Minister to Home
Minister to Intelligence Agencies to other officials, etc. But we don?t have
a deserving leader anywhere in the system. Leader should be demanding,
motivating, decision-making, aggressive, dynamic and lot more than this.
Leaders can?t work without capable teams and vice-versa. But our leader
would look good for www.santabanta.com <http://www.santabanta.com/>  and not
as a national leader
..These guys are now turned to be beggars in-front of
Pakistan ?please provide us all the listed terrorists, we can never catch
them ourselves!?

It is the team who are members of government i.e. IAS, IPS, and other
government officials are having prime responsibility.

 

Let me put evidence for these points ? ?RAW, IB, MUMBAI POLICE & other
security agencies chief and officers should counter each other on not acting
upon the information. Media should also respond in positive direction like
should ask Defense minister to public the report on the action taken on
Information provided by various security agencies related to this BRUTAL
ATTACK.?

 

I feel corruption is the ROOT CAUSE of these attacks. Impact of corruption
and its link of attack is as below:

1. Politician needs money to fight election.

2. Commissioned & other officers need money for better lifestyle &
recognition.

3. Rich people want to rule world utilizing money.

4. Poor / Unemployed people need money for food and life and they become
prime target of such opportunities.

 

No one can remove corruption. But yes physical security can be improved to
have zero-effect of such attacks.

 

My ROOT suggestions for PHYSICAL SECURITY are:

1.      Install scanners on all public places instead of CCTV. These
scanners should automatically send the signal / mail to all local, state
level and central security agencies along with place and pictures.

2.      These scanners should be governed by Army police. 

3.      Defense Ministry should respond on these signal using different
mediums newspaper, websites etc.

4.      There should be one Security Index like BSE, NIFTY which will
present the exact value of security measures and effectiveness.

 

Media and other Intellectual society should present a plan to government on
how we can improve this.

 

Our scientists should demand fund for and develop such scanners.

 

There are a lot of things which makes us (INDIA) vulnerable. We have to
start from somewhere. Only blaming is not the solution.

Dear All

 

100% in agreement with Dhruv, Tarun and Pravin. All these politicians are
not eligible for the job so they should be thrown out of the offices which
ever portfolio they are holding.

 

They don't have a shame on their faces even after such a horrified attack.
Our so called hon'able home minister of Maharashtra is saying that " This
all happens in big cities" then why not he went to Taj or Trident and faced
the bullets, why he was hiding at that time.

 

We should pery to GOD some time these terrorists should some and strike in
these politicians house. 

 

Its shame on all of us also why we choose these as our leaders.

 

For every citizen killed in this attack, equal number of these politicians
should be put in jail for not doing their duty honestly.

 

I would prey from GOD to save all of us from these currupt politicians and
give us some honest leader who can rule this country with honesty.

I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
here with believe that you guys won?t mind it!

 

Indian politicians are taking the civilians for granted and are very much
centric at their personal interests rather caring about interest of the
country. They are good at making unrealistic statements in media but no
action at all. I was in Delhi at the time of this attack on nation, but this
particular incident has really disturbed my deep feelings for my nation and
is giving so disheartening feeling of being an impotent and coward Indian
who can be killed anytime on the roads or in the suite of a 7 star hotel. No
one can enter and open up fire just like that in my home! I am 10000% sure,
the current heat will go on for few more days in Media and politicians will
be under pressure. But when it will come to action, it will be all hollow.
Honorable prime minister has blamed Pakistan for this, which is so lame and
highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can come from any part of the
world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are just terrorists. Who
cares, if they were trained in Pakistan or in America ? Point is, are we
fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border security and then
internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong
intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off their hands
by blaming any other country and must understand that "We are weak from
inside-out". Look at United States , one attack and they just declared
openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy it! But wow!
Welcome to India ! We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation
for OBCs, Marathas rule Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don?t
care about the life of those OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in
our country. I won't be surprised to see another attack in next few months
in Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it. It can just happen to anyone,
except politicians! And they know it very well that they are always going to
be safe due to high personal security. I don't see any GOD for these people
who just don't perform their duties for which they were elected by the
civilians. 

Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for terrorists,
coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a miserable
life. There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people. Cut down
their sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them live a
miserable life in their own country. I am so angry on the way politicians of
my country operate and couldn?t really sleep from last 3 days or concentrate
on my work. May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to take birth in the
country that is always operated by incompetent and impotent politicians!
Probably, our politicians were never fed with their mother's breast milk and
must have been fed by some bitches on the street! That is why they have no
love for their nation! 

Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
single solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can
bring a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will,
but I feel they might) act on terrorism then... 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Dhruv - Politicians are driven by team of leaders (IAS, IPS and other officials). System is in place but the governing body should be made accountable. We should create the environment to isolate leaders and let them feel themselves as "AAM ADMI".

 

I am assuming the scenario should be as below:

 

Chief Home secretary / Politicians say on media - "Yes, I failed and resigning."

Media asks - "Why you have failed?" India need answer. 

 

If there is no reply then he should be terminated from job and no pension and all should be given. There should be zero-tolerance environment w.r.t. 

Human life security.

 

If he blames other person then there should be evidence and all these actions should be made publicly. Government officials & leaders should feel that their job & position are having a lot of responsibilities for entire INDIA.

 

They should feel that "THESE CHAIRS" are not for picnic.

 

 

Regards,

Brij

But I don't. Teams are driven by leaders. If leader will go to sleep, he won't find productivity from the team. It starts from Prime Minister to Home Minister to Intelligence Agencies to other officials, etc. But we don't have a deserving leader anywhere in the system. Leader should be demanding, motivating, decision-making, aggressive, dynamic and lot more than this. Leaders can't work without capable teams and vice-versa. But our leader would look good for www.santabanta.com <http://www.santabanta.com/>  and not as a national leader.....These guys are now turned to be beggars in-front of Pakistan "please provide us all the listed terrorists, we can never catch them ourselves!"

I have different opinion on this. Politicians are responsible but Governments are primarily responsible for this.  Our politicians are not at all smart to drive INDIA on world map.

 

It is the team who are members of government i.e. IAS, IPS, and other government officials are having prime responsibility.

2.      These scanners should be governed by Army police. 

3.      Defense Ministry should respond on these signal using different mediums newspaper, websites etc.

Media and other Intellectual society should present a plan to government on how we can improve this.

 

Our scientists should demand fund for and develop such scanners.

 

There are a lot of things which makes us (INDIA) vulnerable. We have to start from somewhere. Only blaming is not the solution.

Agreed with brij,

 

India has been on the LeT forces target for quite some time. The terrorist
has now declared an open war against our India. They mean to attack India as
a Nation not a part of it. If India has to win this war: We have to
Depoliticise National Security, Create a anti terror database, Attack on
terror camps, Confidence of ordinary people, Control on Media and Crowd,
Technology, Strategy planning, Regulate sale of chemicals and explosives,
and put pressure on US to act against Pakistan.

 

Best regards,

Govind

Agree with the general thoughts that are being discussed. My fear is, with all the emotional response pouring in, we might loose sight of the real issue here and more importantly this might all fizz out in a while like so many other incidents in the past.

Those who died on 26/11 in Mumbai and during all the previous terrorist attacks are not just the victims of a bullet or a blast. They are a victim of a system, plagued with inept people who are in power and with countrymen who will do the talk but not walk the walk. It is a shame. To a certain degree, we are all to blame as we are responsible for making our country what it is today.

I agree with Druv, we as a country lack leaders who can inspire with words and follow through with actions. Corruption is a part of the problem, not the only problem.

Terrorism is a part of life in today's world. Given its nature, no
country can stop it but as pointed out, we need to be prepared for it.
Here, in some sense, philosophically, you can draw a parallel between
terrorism and application security (or insecurity).

We were unprepared, we are unprepared. We always knew it but were hoping that we might be lucky and noone would notice us. 

We are a democracy where people are taken for granted and a part of the problem is that we, the people, have always accepted it as how things will always be. We fume for a , blame each other, at best "discuss ideas" and then move on with our own indivisual busy lives.

I'm not going to mention everything that is wrong with our country but instead make an appeal that we, the people, need to come together and act, and act now. It is only the educated youth of this country, the common man who can bring in the change that we all wish to see. Let us not get bogged down by the system and the inept leaders we have. 

I and a few friends of mine are willing to volunteer and help in our limited capacity if someone is aware of a "meaningful" movement or platform that is out there. 

(Not sure if Dharmesh (OWASP Mumbai) hangs out here, but would be worthwhile to float this in the Mumbai community as well)

It is time to act, lets start with a step.

thanks,

But I don?t. Teams are driven by
leaders. If leader will go to sleep, he won?t find productivity from the
team. It starts from Prime Minister to Home Minister to Intelligence Agencies
to other officials, etc. But we don?t have a deserving leader anywhere in
the system. Leader should be demanding, motivating, decision-making, aggressive,
dynamic and lot more than this. Leaders can?t work without capable teams
and vice-versa. But our leader would look good for www.santabanta.com and not as a national
leader?..These guys are now turned to be beggars in-front of
 Pakistan ?please
provide us all the listed terrorists, we can never catch them ourselves!?

Dhruv, 

 ? 

I have different opinion on this.
Politicians are responsible but Governments are primarily responsible for this.
?Our politicians are not at all smart to drive
 INDIA on world map. 

 ? 

It is the team who are members of
government i.e. IAS, IPS, and other government officials are having prime
responsibility. 

 ? 

Let me put evidence for these points
? ?RAW, IB, MUMBAI POLICE & other security agencies chief and
officers should counter each other on not acting upon the information. Media
should also respond in positive direction like should ask Defense minister to
public the report on the action taken on Information provided by various
security agencies related to this BRUTAL ATTACK.? 

 ? 

I feel corruption is the ROOT CAUSE of
these attacks. Impact of corruption and its link of attack is as below: 

1.
Politician needs money to fight election. 

2.
Commissioned & other officers need money for better lifestyle &
recognition. 

3.
Rich people want to rule world utilizing money. 

4. Poor
/ Unemployed people need money for food and life and they become prime target
of such opportunities. 

 ? 

No
one can remove corruption. But yes physical security can be improved to have
zero-effect of such attacks. 

 ? 

My ROOT suggestions for PHYSICAL SECURITY
are: 

1.????? Install scanners on all public places instead of CCTV. These
scanners should automatically send the signal / mail to all local, state level
and central security agencies along with place and pictures. 

2.????? These scanners should be governed by Army police.  

3.????? Defense Ministry should respond on these signal using different
mediums newspaper, websites etc. 

4.????? There should be one Security Index like BSE, NIFTY which will
present the exact value of security measures and effectiveness. 

 ? 

Media and other Intellectual society
should present a plan to government on how we can improve this. 

 ? 

Our scientists should demand fund for
and develop such scanners. 

 ? 

There are a lot of things which makes us
( INDIA )
vulnerable. We have to start from somewhere. Only blaming is not the solution.

National security [Mumbai Attacks] and not application security!! 



I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI
ATTACKS] here with believe that you guys won?t mind it! 

? 

Indian politicians are
taking the civilians for granted and are very much centric at their personal
interests rather caring about interest of the country. They are good at making
unrealistic statements in media but no action at all. I was in
 Delhi at the time of this
attack on nation, but this particular incident has really disturbed my deep
feelings for my nation and is giving so disheartening feeling of being an
impotent and coward Indian who can be killed anytime on the roads or in the
suite of a 7 star hotel. No one can enter and open up fire just like that in my
home! I am 10000% sure, the current heat will go on for few more days in Media
and politicians will be under pressure. But when it will come to action, it
will be all hollow. Honorable prime minister has blamed
 Pakistan for this, which is so lame
and highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can come from any part of the
world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are just terrorists. Who cares,
if they were trained in Pakistan 
or in America 
? Point is, are we fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border
security and then internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and
building strong intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off
their hands by blaming any other country and must understand that "We are
weak from inside-out". Look at
 United States , one attack and they
just declared openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy
it! But wow! Welcome to India 
! We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation for OBCs, Marathas
rule Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don?t care about the life of
those OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in our country. I won't be
surprised to see another attack in next few months in
 Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it.
It can just happen to anyone, except politicians! And they know it very well
that they are always going to be safe due to high personal security. I don't
see any GOD for these people who just don't perform their duties for which they
were elected by the civilians. 



Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for terrorists,
coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a miserable life.
There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people. Cut down their
sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them live a miserable
life in their own country. I am so angry on the way politicians of my country
operate and couldn?t really sleep from last 3 days or concentrate on my work.
May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to take birth in the country that
is always operated by incompetent and impotent politicians! Probably, our
politicians were never fed with their mother's breast milk and must have been
fed by some bitches on the street! That is why they have no love for their
nation! 



Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a single
solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can bring
a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will, but I feel
they might) act on terrorism then...  

? 

Many Thanks, 

Dhruv

If you meet any Indian politician, ask him to kill me. I don't want a death

Hi Jitesh,

 

I am also in touch with couple of local and overseas friends of mine and
were exploring some idea on starting some independent intelligence group.
But I just heard that Zee TV has got 1500 volunteers who would be
participating in similar nation wide movement.  

 

I am marking this email to OWASP Mumbai to establish a bridge between common
communities. I am not sure but still hope and pray to GOD that our
colleagues from Mumbai are safe at home.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

LETTER TO PRIMEMINISTER

 

 

Dear Mr. Prime minister 

 

I am a typical mouse from Mumbai. In the local train compartment which has
capacity of 100 persons, I travel with 500 more mouse. Mouse at least squeak
but we don't even do that. 

Today I heard your speech. In which you said 'NO BODY WOULD BE SPARED'.

I would like to remind you that fourteen years has passed since serial bomb
blast in Mumbai took place. Dawood was the main conspirator. Till today he
is not caught. All our bolywood actors, our builders, our Gutka king meets
him but your Government can not catch him. Reason is simple; all your
ministers are hand in glove with him. If any attempt is made to catch him
everybody will be exposed. Your statement 'NOBODY WOULD BE SPARED' is
nothing but a cruel joke on this unfortunate people of India .... 

Enough is enough. As such after seeing terrorist attack carried out by about
a dozen young boys I realize that if same thing continues days are not away
when terrorist will attack by air, destroy our nuclear reactor and there
will be one more Hiroshima . 

 

We the people are left with only one mantra. Womb to Bomb to Tomb. You
promised Mumbaikar Shanghai what you have given us is Jalianwala Baug. 

Today only your home minister resigned. What took you so long to kick out
this joker? Only reason was that he was loyal to Gandhi family.

Loyalty to Gandhi family is more important than blood of innocent people,
isn't it? 

I am born and bought up in Mumbai for last fifty eight years. Believe me
corruption in Maharashtra is worse than that in Bihar . Look at all the
politician, Sharad Pawar, Chagan Bhujbal, Narayan Rane, Bal Thackray ,
Gopinath Munde, Raj Thackray, Vilasrao Deshmukh all are rolling in money.
Vilasrao Deshmukh is one of the worst Chief minister I have seen.

His only business is to increase the FSI every other day, make money and
send it to Delhi so Congress can fight next election. Now the clown has
found new way and will increase FSI for fisherman so they can build concrete
house right on sea shore. Next time terrorist can comfortably live in those
house , enjoy the beauty of sea and then attack the Mumbai at their will. 

Recently I had to purchase house in Mumbai. I met about two dozen builders.
Everybody wanted about 30% in black. A common person like me knows this and
with all your intelligent agency & CBI you and your finance minister are not
aware of it. Where all the black money goes? To the underworld isn't it? Our
politicians take help of these goondas to vacate people by force. I myself
was victim of it. If you have time please come to me, I will tell you
everything. 

If this has been land of fools, idiots then I would not have ever cared to
write you this letter. Just see the tragedy, on one side we are reaching
moon, people are so intelligent and on other side you politician has
converted nectar into deadly poison. I am everything Hindu, Muslim,
Christian, Schedule caste, OBC, Muslim OBC, Christian Schedule caste, Creamy
Schedule caste only what I am not is INDIAN. You politician have raped every
part of mother India by your policy of divide and rule. 

Take example of former president Abdul Kalam. Such a intelligent person,
such a fine human being. You politician didn't even spare him. Your party
along with opposition joined the hands, because politician feels they are
supreme and there is no place for good person. 

Dear Mr Prime minister you are one of the most intelligent person, most
learned person. Just wake up, be a real SARDAR. First and foremost expose
all selfish politician. Ask Swiss bank to give name of all Indian account
holder. Give reins of CBI to independent agency. Let them find wolf among
us. There will be political upheaval but that will better than dance of
death which we are witnessing every day. Just give us ambient where we can
work honestly and without fear. Let there be rule of law. Everything else
will be taken care of. 

Choice is yours Mr. Prime Minister. Do you want to be lead by one person or
you want to lead the nation of 100 Crore people?

Hi All,

 

Just a small observation

 

An Indian shoots the gold medal in Olympics and gets 5 crores from the
government.

 

An Indian gets shot at and dies in his homeland and the government gives him
5 lakhs.

 

Our country is going in a path which leads to nowhere, we the youth and
citizens who are concerned and committed need to act NOW and do what is
best.

 

 

Best regards,

Govind

Agreed with brij,

 

India has been on the LeT forces target for quite some time. The terrorist
has now declared an open war against our India. They mean to attack India as
a Nation not a part of it. If India has to win this war: We have to
Depoliticise National Security, Create a anti terror database, Attack on
terror camps, Confidence of ordinary people, Control on Media and Crowd,
Technology, Strategy planning, Regulate sale of chemicals and explosives,
and put pressure on US to act against Pakistan.

 

Best regards,

Govind

Dhruv,

 

I have different opinion on this. Politicians are responsible but
Governments are primarily responsible for this.  Our politicians are not at
all smart to drive INDIA on world map.

 

It is the team who are members of government i.e. IAS, IPS, and other
government officials are having prime responsibility.

 

Let me put evidence for these points ? ?RAW, IB, MUMBAI POLICE & other
security agencies chief and officers should counter each other on not acting
upon the information. Media should also respond in positive direction like
should ask Defense minister to public the report on the action taken on
Information provided by various security agencies related to this BRUTAL
ATTACK.?

 

I feel corruption is the ROOT CAUSE of these attacks. Impact of corruption
and its link of attack is as below:

1. Politician needs money to fight election.

2. Commissioned & other officers need money for better lifestyle &
recognition.

3. Rich people want to rule world utilizing money.

4. Poor / Unemployed people need money for food and life and they become
prime target of such opportunities.

 

No one can remove corruption. But yes physical security can be improved to
have zero-effect of such attacks.

 

My ROOT suggestions for PHYSICAL SECURITY are:

1.      Install scanners on all public places instead of CCTV. These
scanners should automatically send the signal / mail to all local, state
level and central security agencies along with place and pictures.

2.      These scanners should be governed by Army police. 

3.      Defense Ministry should respond on these signal using different
mediums newspaper, websites etc.

4.      There should be one Security Index like BSE, NIFTY which will
present the exact value of security measures and effectiveness.

 

Media and other Intellectual society should present a plan to government on
how we can improve this.

 

Our scientists should demand fund for and develop such scanners.

 

There are a lot of things which makes us (INDIA) vulnerable. We have to
start from somewhere. Only blaming is not the solution. 

 

 

Regards,

Brij

Dear All

 

100% in agreement with Dhruv, Tarun and Pravin. All these politicians are
not eligible for the job so they should be thrown out of the offices which
ever portfolio they are holding.

 

They don't have a shame on their faces even after such a horrified attack.
Our so called hon'able home minister of Maharashtra is saying that " This
all happens in big cities" then why not he went to Taj or Trident and faced
the bullets, why he was hiding at that time.

 

We should pery to GOD some time these terrorists should some and strike in
these politicians house. 

 

Its shame on all of us also why we choose these as our leaders.

 

For every citizen killed in this attack, equal number of these politicians
should be put in jail for not doing their duty honestly.

 

I would prey from GOD to save all of us from these currupt politicians and
give us some honest leader who can rule this country with honesty.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] [Offtopic] National security [Mumbai Attacks] and not

I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
here with believe that you guys won?t mind it!

 

Indian politicians are taking the civilians for granted and are very much
centric at their personal interests rather caring about interest of the
country. They are good at making unrealistic statements in media but no
action at all. I was in Delhi at the time of this attack on nation, but this
particular incident has really disturbed my deep feelings for my nation and
is giving so disheartening feeling of being an impotent and coward Indian
who can be killed anytime on the roads or in the suite of a 7 star hotel. No
one can enter and open up fire just like that in my home! I am 10000% sure,
the current heat will go on for few more days in Media and politicians will
be under pressure. But when it will come to action, it will be all hollow.
Honorable prime minister has blamed Pakistan for this, which is so lame and
highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can come from any part of the
world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are just terrorists. Who
cares, if they were trained in Pakistan or in America ? Point is, are we
fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border security and then
internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong
intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off their hands
by blaming any other country and must understand that "We are weak from
inside-out". Look at United States , one attack and they just declared
openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy it! But wow!
Welcome to India ! We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation
for OBCs, Marathas rule Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don?t
care about the life of those OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in
our country. I won't be surprised to see another attack in next few months
in Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it. It can just happen to anyone,
except politicians! And they know it very well that they are always going to
be safe due to high personal security. I don't see any GOD for these people
who just don't perform their duties for which they were elected by the
civilians. 

Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for terrorists,
coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a miserable
life. There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people. Cut down
their sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them live a
miserable life in their own country. I am so angry on the way politicians of
my country operate and couldn?t really sleep from last 3 days or concentrate
on my work. May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to take birth in the
country that is always operated by incompetent and impotent politicians!
Probably, our politicians were never fed with their mother's breast milk and
must have been fed by some bitches on the street! That is why they have no
love for their nation! 

Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
single solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can
bring a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will,
but I feel they might) act on terrorism then... 

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

If you meet any Indian politician, ask him to kill me. I don't want a death

Message-ID: <000601c95613$2af0c7c0$5701a8c0@souravd>

One of my colleagues just shared this with me which i thought of extending
to everyone, this indeed can serve as a powerful medium of expression. Just
go through it :

Did you know that there is a system in our constitution, as per the 1969
act, in section " 49-O" that a person can go to the polling booth, confirm
his identity, get his finger marked and convey the presiding election
officer that he doesn't want to vote anyone!

Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never
disclosed it....
This is called "49-O".

Why should you go and say " I VOTE NOBODY"... because, in a ward, if a
candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
"49-O" votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the contestants
will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling, since people had
already expressed their decision on them.
This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates for
their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....

Please spread this news to as many as you know...
Seems to be a wonderful weapon against corrupt parties in India ... show
your power, expressing your desire not to vote for anybody, is even more
powerful than voting.... so don't miss your chance. So either vote, or vote
not to vote (vote 49-O)

Use your voting right for a better INDIA

Few cents on the thread in general ....

 

Since last 2-3 years I keep getting a mail "I vote nobody" and about
"49-O" from lot of my friends. In last 2-3 days the frequency has
increased.

 

I would like to explain you that by doing this we are in no way doing
any better for this country. I would like to tell that this kind of mail
will go to more than say 50-60 or say 100 million people. More over all
these people are educated and from all over the country.

 

My country's problem is that the educated people do not vote and even if
they vote they vote dividedly. By spreading this kind of message and we
are making educated people's vote more irrelevant.  In every
constituency in India there is 50-60 % voter who vote, out of these
40-50% do not have email access. Hardly 10-15% will be educated email
accessing people are there in general. Giving a thought that people who
access mail and educated are in majority of what contingencies? 20-30
that's it....honestly these kind of people are not in majority even a
single contingencies as our dear politicians kept the all these things
in mind when they kept illegal Bangladeshis in our country. They kept
their calculation pretty good when they allow slums in metros. They are
also very good in making sure that all those people will have voter card
and will vote for them. 

 

Even I would see a conspiracy by some other political groups to make
educated peoples' vote invalid, because they know that this vote can go
against them.

 

So friends if we really want to do some thing Vote and Vote undividedly.
No cast No religion No rich poor. Only country. Vote for your country.
And we all know nothing is perfect in this world. Our salary is not
perfect for us. Our boss is not perfect for us. Our job is not perfect
for us. Our house is not perfect for us. Our city is not perfect for us.
What do we do? We manage and try to adjust with less problematic thing.
We choose time and time again. We select and rearrange our priority time
and time again.

 

Why we want a perfect leader or politicians. We can choose best among
them or we ourselves can go and fight an election. If you think some one
did wrong this time do not vote for him. Let's teach them a lesson. Make
sure we and our friends don't Vote for such leaders who are worth good
for nothing. Next time teach this lesson to some one else. We have to
choose less evil. And keep searching for good. Do not stop any where.
"Change is definitely required". We also need to be patient. Problem
that has been created in last 20 years will not be solved in day's time
but keep trying and allow and encourage people to try.

 

Take the example of reservation, in early 90's its only V.P. Singh who
was stood for reservations for backward classes and all were against,
now every political party stand for it, because those people kept voting
undividedly for about 20 years for some one or other one.

 

Don't stop trying and voting. Neither waste your vote, because we are
dead even before blast when we stop trying and start using these kind of
"49-O" ......

Hi all,

 

RULE 49-O is a Rule in the The Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, which
governs elections in India. It covers the procedures to be followed when
a valid voter decides not to cast his vote, and decides to record this
fact. Recording one's vote under Rule 49-O is a choice that voters can
exercise to prevent electoral fraud, and misuse of their vote.

 

NEGATIVE / NEUTRAL VOTING

 

The Commission has received proposals from a very large number of
individuals and organizations that there should be a provision enabling
a voter to reject all the candidates in the constituency if he does not
find them suitable. In the voting using the conventional ballot paper
and ballot boxes, an elector can drop the ballot paper without marking
his vote against any of the candidates, if he chooses so. However, in
the voting using the Electronic Voting Machines, such a facility is not
available to the voter. Although, Rule 49 O of the Conduct of Election
Rules, 1961 provides that an elector may refuse to vote after he has
been identified and necessary entries made in the Register of Electors
and the marked copy of the electoral roll, the secrecy of voting is not
protected here inasmuch as the polling officials and the polling agents
in the polling station get to know about the decision of such a voter.

 

The Commission recommends that the law should be amended to specifically
provide for negative / neutral voting. For this purpose, Rules 22 and
49B of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 may be suitably amended
adding a proviso that in the ballot paper and the particulars on the
ballot unit, in the column relating to names of candidates, after the
entry relating to the last candidate, there shall be a column '"None of
the above'", to enable a voter to reject all the candidates, if he
chooses so. Such a proposal was earlier made by the Commission in 2001
(vide letter dated 10.12.2001).

 

(A petition by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties seeking such a
provision filed at the time of the recent general elections is pending
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court)

 

Please note that this request may not have been turned into a law as
yet.

 

Since the ballot paper/EVM contains only the list of candidates, a voter
cannot record his vote under Section 49-O directly. He must inform the
presiding officer at the election booth. This violates the secrecy of
the ballot. However, with paper ballot a different method is used to
"waste" ones vote, which is stamping on multiple candidates. In fact
this was the standard method of giving null votes without violating
secrecy before the advent of the EVM.

 

The exact implications of Rule 49-O from the perspective of winner
declaration are unclear. It may be, given the present state of The
Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, assumed that a winner will be declared
irrespective of the number of 'non-votes'. However, a note of every
'non-vote' will be made with the Election Officer, and the total number
of non-voters will, presumably, be available under the Right to
Information, Act. Please note that the availability of this information
has not been confirmed as yet.

 

 

Some recent articles and a Dedicated Website on Section 49-0 falsely
suggest that in case the number of votes recorded under Section 49-O is
greater than the maximum number of votes polled in favour of any of the
candidates, a repoll is held. However it is misleading since nothing to
this effect is mentioned either in any of the sections of The Conduct of
Elections Rules, 1961 or People's Representative Act nor can it can be
construed reading Section 49-0 in conjunction with any other Section/
Act. In fact Post terrorist Attacks on Mumbai on 26th November 2008 an
Urban Myth is being propagated through Internet that a Re-Poll will be
held in case the number of No Votes under Section 49-O is more than the
Margin of Victory.

 

(Source- Wikipedia)

 

But no doubt about that these steps will be damn good step to avoid
these stupid politicians.

One of my colleagues just shared this with me which i thought of
extending to everyone, this indeed can serve as a powerful medium of
expression. Just go through it :


Did you know that there is a system in our constitution, as per the 1969
act, in section " 49-O" that a person can go to the polling booth,
confirm his identity, get his finger marked and convey the presiding
election officer that he doesn't want to vote anyone!


Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never
disclosed it....
This is called "49-O".


Why should you go and say " I VOTE NOBODY"... because, in a ward, if a
candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
"49-O" votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the
contestants will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling,
since people had already expressed their decision on them.
This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates
for their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....


Please spread this news to as many as you know...

Good representation of thoughts and I agree to an extent.......

 

I would like to add.... "How many of us know that a parallel platform of
professionals is developing a political party, under Shiv Khera?"

 

I don't know how much that political party will flourish and how much they
can do better for the country, but I must appreciate the effort which is
being put by this gentleman. He wrote the Books "You Can Win" & "Freedom is
not Free" and if he has same vision and mission, one can see a ray of Hope.

 

I think they charge Re. 10/- for the membership and then evaluate the worker
on their qualifications and credentials. 

 

Explore it .... For INDIA

Few cents on the thread in general ..

 

Since last 2-3 years I keep getting a mail "I vote nobody" and about "49-O"
from lot of my friends. In last 2-3 days the frequency has increased.

 

I would like to explain you that by doing this we are in no way doing any
better for this country. I would like to tell that this kind of mail will go
to more than say 50-60 or say 100 million people. More over all these people
are educated and from all over the country.

 

My country's problem is that the educated people do not vote and even if
they vote they vote dividedly. By spreading this kind of message and we are
making educated people's vote more irrelevant.  In every constituency in
India there is 50-60 % voter who vote, out of these 40-50% do not have email
access. Hardly 10-15% will be educated email accessing people are there in
general. Giving a thought that people who access mail and educated are in
majority of what contingencies? 20-30 that's it..honestly these kind of
people are not in majority even a single contingencies as our dear
politicians kept the all these things in mind when they kept illegal
Bangladeshis in our country. They kept their calculation pretty good when
they allow slums in metros. They are also very good in making sure that all
those people will have voter card and will vote for them. 

 

Even I would see a conspiracy by some other political groups to make
educated peoples' vote invalid, because they know that this vote can go
against them.

 

So friends if we really want to do some thing Vote and Vote undividedly. No
cast No religion No rich poor. Only country. Vote for your country. And we
all know nothing is perfect in this world. Our salary is not perfect for us.
Our boss is not perfect for us. Our job is not perfect for us. Our house is
not perfect for us. Our city is not perfect for us. What do we do? We manage
and try to adjust with less problematic thing. We choose time and time
again. We select and rearrange our priority time and time again.

 

Why we want a perfect leader or politicians. We can choose best among them
or we ourselves can go and fight an election. If you think some one did
wrong this time do not vote for him. Let's teach them a lesson. Make sure we
and our friends don't Vote for such leaders who are worth good for nothing.
Next time teach this lesson to some one else. We have to choose less evil.
And keep searching for good. Do not stop any where. "Change is definitely
required". We also need to be patient. Problem that has been created in last
20 years will not be solved in day's time but keep trying and allow and
encourage people to try.

 

Take the example of reservation, in early 90's its only V.P. Singh who was
stood for reservations for backward classes and all were against, now every
political party stand for it, because those people kept voting undividedly
for about 20 years for some one or other one.

 

Don't stop trying and voting. Neither waste your vote, because we are dead
even before blast when we stop trying and start using these kind of "49-O"
..

I am in 100% agreement with Nalin. This way we will be losing our own Money
and time. Even if one batch is disqualified who knows the other one is not
same. 

 

All are same so by just avoiding vote or doing it using "49-O" is not going
to harm these politicians. They will remain same but will lose more public
money and time. We should try to fight altogether and try to get best leader
at the Top.

 

This is the failure of system so we need to make our system more strong. At
present we should force these leaders to make strong laws so that cases
against Terrorists do not take long time to complete. There should be
provision for toughest punishments for these people

Few cents on the thread in general ..

 

Since last 2-3 years I keep getting a mail "I vote nobody" and about "49-O"
from lot of my friends. In last 2-3 days the frequency has increased.

 

I would like to explain you that by doing this we are in no way doing any
better for this country. I would like to tell that this kind of mail will go
to more than say 50-60 or say 100 million people. More over all these people
are educated and from all over the country.

 

My country's problem is that the educated people do not vote and even if
they vote they vote dividedly. By spreading this kind of message and we are
making educated people's vote more irrelevant.  In every constituency in
India there is 50-60 % voter who vote, out of these 40-50% do not have email
access. Hardly 10-15% will be educated email accessing people are there in
general. Giving a thought that people who access mail and educated are in
majority of what contingencies? 20-30 that's it..honestly these kind of
people are not in majority even a single contingencies as our dear
politicians kept the all these things in mind when they kept illegal
Bangladeshis in our country. They kept their calculation pretty good when
they allow slums in metros. They are also very good in making sure that all
those people will have voter card and will vote for them. 

 

Even I would see a conspiracy by some other political groups to make
educated peoples' vote invalid, because they know that this vote can go
against them.

 

So friends if we really want to do some thing Vote and Vote undividedly. No
cast No religion No rich poor. Only country. Vote for your country. And we
all know nothing is perfect in this world. Our salary is not perfect for us.
Our boss is not perfect for us. Our job is not perfect for us. Our house is
not perfect for us. Our city is not perfect for us. What do we do? We manage
and try to adjust with less problematic thing. We choose time and time
again. We select and rearrange our priority time and time again.

 

Why we want a perfect leader or politicians. We can choose best among them
or we ourselves can go and fight an election. If you think some one did
wrong this time do not vote for him. Let's teach them a lesson. Make sure we
and our friends don't Vote for such leaders who are worth good for nothing.
Next time teach this lesson to some one else. We have to choose less evil.
And keep searching for good. Do not stop any where. "Change is definitely
required". We also need to be patient. Problem that has been created in last
20 years will not be solved in day's time but keep trying and allow and
encourage people to try.

 

Take the example of reservation, in early 90's its only V.P. Singh who was
stood for reservations for backward classes and all were against, now every
political party stand for it, because those people kept voting undividedly
for about 20 years for some one or other one.

 

Don't stop trying and voting. Neither waste your vote, because we are dead
even before blast when we stop trying and start using these kind of "49-O"
..

One of my colleagues just shared this with me which i thought of extending
to everyone, this indeed can serve as a powerful medium of expression. Just
go through it :


Did you know that there is a system in our constitution, as per the 1969
act, in section " 49-O" that a person can go to the polling booth, confirm
his identity, get his finger marked and convey the presiding election
officer that he doesn't want to vote anyone!


Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never
disclosed it....
This is called "49-O".


Why should you go and say " I VOTE NOBODY"... because, in a ward, if a
candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
"49-O" votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the contestants
will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling, since people had
already expressed their decision on them.
This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates for
their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....


Please spread this news to as many as you know...
Seems to be a wonderful weapon against corrupt parties in India ... show
your power, expressing your desire not to vote for anybody, is even more
powerful than voting.... so don't miss your chance. So either vote, or vote
not to vote (vote 49-O)


Use your voting right for a better INDIA

The big question here is that who will take matters into hands as
politicians have time and again failed to improve the situations, look at
the laws like POTA which has fared badly as it took no notice of the
concerns of common man like me and made terrorists and citizens alike. 
 
Where is the tax payers money going even after the last few years when you,
me and everyone has paid taxes like anything burning our pockets, it is
going into the politics and Power games which these parties are playing at
our cost. 
The powergames played by these political parties make out a complete mockery
of the system and put us at risk at the cost of our lives.
 
It should be whose duty to take matters into hands as the people elected by
us do things no better than an illiterate person throwing chairs, breaking
tables, do not even let the person elected by us say there words in the
parliament when whole of the nation is watching these actions LIVE ! It
would be better not at all to vote even so that each and everyone of these
politicians fails and at least takes notice that they need to look at our
concerns and that People of the Republic of India are not going to take any
nuisances anymore NOW !

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta

Hi Sandeep,

 

Once in a while such noise should be allowed with a focus on the core
objective and mission of this group. It helps in building liaison among the
list members by sharing their views over non-technical stuff. But yeah, such
stuff should not roll around every another day because then it completely
defeats the objective.

 

Members: In case, your post is not related to application security or

Many Thanks,

I am in 100% agreement with Nalin. This way we will be losing our own Money
and time. Even if one batch is disqualified who knows the other one is not
same. 

 

All are same so by just avoiding vote or doing it using "49-O" is not going
to harm these politicians. They will remain same but will lose more public
money and time. We should try to fight altogether and try to get best leader
at the Top.

 

This is the failure of system so we need to make our system more strong. At
present we should force these leaders to make strong laws so that cases
against Terrorists do not take long time to complete. There should be
provision for toughest punishments for these people

Few cents on the thread in general ..

 

Since last 2-3 years I keep getting a mail "I vote nobody" and about "49-O"
from lot of my friends. In last 2-3 days the frequency has increased.

 

I would like to explain you that by doing this we are in no way doing any
better for this country. I would like to tell that this kind of mail will go
to more than say 50-60 or say 100 million people. More over all these people
are educated and from all over the country.

 

My country's problem is that the educated people do not vote and even if
they vote they vote dividedly. By spreading this kind of message and we are
making educated people's vote more irrelevant.  In every constituency in
India there is 50-60 % voter who vote, out of these 40-50% do not have email
access. Hardly 10-15% will be educated email accessing people are there in
general. Giving a thought that people who access mail and educated are in
majority of what contingencies? 20-30 that's it..honestly these kind of
people are not in majority even a single contingencies as our dear
politicians kept the all these things in mind when they kept illegal
Bangladeshis in our country. They kept their calculation pretty good when
they allow slums in metros. They are also very good in making sure that all
those people will have voter card and will vote for them. 

 

Even I would see a conspiracy by some other political groups to make
educated peoples' vote invalid, because they know that this vote can go
against them.

 

So friends if we really want to do some thing Vote and Vote undividedly. No
cast No religion No rich poor. Only country. Vote for your country. And we
all know nothing is perfect in this world. Our salary is not perfect for us.
Our boss is not perfect for us. Our job is not perfect for us. Our house is
not perfect for us. Our city is not perfect for us. What do we do? We manage
and try to adjust with less problematic thing. We choose time and time
again. We select and rearrange our priority time and time again.

 

Why we want a perfect leader or politicians. We can choose best among them
or we ourselves can go and fight an election. If you think some one did
wrong this time do not vote for him. Let's teach them a lesson. Make sure we
and our friends don't Vote for such leaders who are worth good for nothing.
Next time teach this lesson to some one else. We have to choose less evil.
And keep searching for good. Do not stop any where. "Change is definitely
required". We also need to be patient. Problem that has been created in last
20 years will not be solved in day's time but keep trying and allow and
encourage people to try.

 

Take the example of reservation, in early 90's its only V.P. Singh who was
stood for reservations for backward classes and all were against, now every
political party stand for it, because those people kept voting undividedly
for about 20 years for some one or other one.

 

Don't stop trying and voting. Neither waste your vote, because we are dead
even before blast when we stop trying and start using these kind of "49-O"
..

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] 49-O in Constitution of India

 

One of my colleagues just shared this with me which i thought of extending
to everyone, this indeed can serve as a powerful medium of expression. Just
go through it :


Did you know that there is a system in our constitution, as per the 1969
act, in section " 49-O" that a person can go to the polling booth, confirm
his identity, get his finger marked and convey the presiding election
officer that he doesn't want to vote anyone!


Yes such a feature is available, but obviously these leaders have never
disclosed it....
This is called "49-O".


Why should you go and say " I VOTE NOBODY"... because, in a ward, if a
candidate wins, say by 123 votes, and that particular ward has received
"49-O" votes more than 123, then that polling will be cancelled and will
have to be re-polled. Not only that, but the candidature of the contestants
will be removed and they cannot contest the re-polling, since people had
already expressed their decision on them.
This would bring fear into parties and hence look for genuine candidates for
their parties for election. This would change the way; of our whole
political system....... it is seemingly surprising why the election
commission has not revealed such a feature to the public....


Please spread this news to as many as you know...
Seems to be a wonderful weapon against corrupt parties in India ... show
your power, expressing your desire not to vote for anybody, is even more
powerful than voting.... so don't miss your chance. So either vote, or vote
not to vote (vote 49-O)


Use your voting right for a better INDIA

Few funny posts about PCI DSS from Jeremiah's Blog:
http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2008/04/my-blog-is-pci-certified-by-sca
nless.html
http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2008/07/pci-dss-references-outdated-owa
sp-top.html

I found that PCI requirements for companies around here are raised by their
overseas partners to have their development team trained and get their
application PCI compliant. To be specific, with growing rate of our offshore
industry we are in high need of compliance and regulatory body. And
compliance doesn't mean ISO, PCI or SOX rather should be a new compliance
applicable to Indian Industry in terms of affordability and controls
relevant to Indian industry. In India, compliance means a certificate that
can be well framed and hanged at reception area so that visitors can say
"wow!"

For sure, PCI is needed for debit/credit card vendors but rest of the
software development industry should be kept at equal leverage and there
should be a strong regulatory body to do anytime audit rather annual or one
time audits so that companies clean and read the hanged certificate frame on
daily basis :-) I had a short conversation with NASSCOM officials last week
and I raised the same concern. It seems that they are equally aware about
the seriousness of this matter but forming a new compliance is like burning
the midnight oil. I personally don't see PCI to be 100% effective
compliance. Read out their 6.5 clause that follows OWASP top 10 and you may
find dozens of scanning tools on the wild those claim that their reports are
PCI compliant. Which means, if a tool has detected 10 XSS, 5 SQL injections
and skipped 50 other XSS along with 20 more SQL injection flaws it will
still claim the report to be PCI compliant. Controls can be built,
compliance can be achieved but till the time company itself is not serious
about the security of its resources, such effort is only going to result in
a frame at the reception and a big banner "PCI CERTIFIED" on the website.
Remember HackerSafe?

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta

Hi All,
?? We started this group to discuss core issues related to threats and vulnerability to the software industry and development. Now slowly- 2 we are moving to other discussions, terror/ elections and common issues. This way we are diluting the purpose and effectiveness of core agenda. 
?
There are other forms, where these issues can be discussed and find lots of participants. 
?
My only request is to keep objective of this form live and do not dilute it with other issues and hope to get more participants.

PCI DSS is a standard which was founded by visa, mastercard, am ex among
others. its purely a standard for protecting credit card data. I dont think
it would be prudent to have PCI DSS included in IT act or for that matter
including any standard in the IT act. Laws can not be goverened by standard
run by private intitutions. However since credit cards in india can only be
issued by banks, RBI can issue guidelines to banks to adhere to a set
acceptable standard. it could be PCI DSS or any other.

The PCI security Standard council, has fixed standard on who should undergo
certification under PCI DSS. As per my last understanding, any one
processing, storing, transmitting more than 6 million records annually needs
to have certification done. So merchants such as Shoppers Stop would come in
close. Banks such as SBI, ICICI and Citi would also fall under this
category. however adherance to this guidelines seems to be low. not sure
why. Since the certification is purely govered by this private institution,
it seems they have some exception process.

Hope this is helpful

As rightly said - the PCI DSS standard is for credit card data
protection. It is mandated by the Card industry which founded the
standards. Compliance is necessary by any entity processing, storing or
transmitting credit card info. However, the nature of audit depends on
the volume of transaction. 6 million records and above have to go in for
an onsite audit. Less than that - a self assessment questionnaire needs
to be filled up and vetted and sent as compliance to PCI DSS. As far as
I know, there is no merchant or service provider in India who meet the
requirement for an onsite audit.
 
Talking of standards - are there any standards for application security
against which they can be certified. Common Criteria is one but scope of
CC is much wider. Any ideas?

Monika Lal

It has nothing to do IT Act . It is Payment Card Industry Data Security standard and specific to that only.  PCIDSS is implemented worldwide and in India also it is there. It is mandatory by Visa and master so everyone who is going to use it have to comply with PCI DSS.

If we lobby in Nasscom, the amount each IT company has to spend, will be huge.

If anyone interested in the complete process (it has more than 20 components) between you swipe your card and you get a receipt, do let me know.
You will be surprised how VISA/MASTER get there share out of it.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] PCI Compliance

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta

As rightly said - the PCI DSS standard is for credit card data protection.
It is mandated by the Card industry which founded the standards. Compliance
is necessary by any entity processing, storing or transmitting credit card
info. However, the nature of audit depends on the volume of transaction. 6
million records and above have to go in for an onsite audit. Less than that
- a self assessment questionnaire needs to be filled up and vetted and sent
as compliance to PCI DSS. As far as I know, there is no merchant or service
provider in India who meet the requirement for an onsite audit.

 

Talking of standards - are there any standards for application security
against which they can be certified. Common Criteria is one but scope of CC
is much wider. Any ideas?

PCI DSS is a standard which was founded by visa, mastercard, am ex among
others. its purely a standard for protecting credit card data. I dont think
it would be prudent to have PCI DSS included in IT act or for that matter
including any standard in the IT act. Laws can not be goverened by standard
run by private intitutions. However since credit cards in india can only be
issued by banks, RBI can issue guidelines to banks to adhere to a set
acceptable standard. it could be PCI DSS or any other.

The PCI security Standard council, has fixed standard on who should undergo
certification under PCI DSS. As per my last understanding, any one
processing, storing, transmitting more than 6 million records annually needs
to have certification done. So merchants such as Shoppers Stop would come in
close. Banks such as SBI, ICICI and Citi would also fall under this
category. however adherance to this guidelines seems to be low. not sure
why. Since the certification is purely govered by this private institution,
it seems they have some exception process. 

Hope this is helpful

Hi Dhruv,

As there is some interest among the OWASP members on PCI, I thought to
inform you about the PCI Summit which is going to be conducted by SISA with
support from VISA, MasterCard and ISACA, at Hotel Orchid  Mumbai, on Dec
19th 2008. I am a PCI QSA (qualified security assessor) and my company SISA
is organizing this summit on PCI standards, namely PCI DSS (Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard) and PA-DSS (Payment Application Data
Security Standard). This summit will be attended by payment brands VISA and
MasterCard, by HDFC bank, merchants like Vodafone, IT companies and BPO's.
The topics included in the summit are 'evolution of PCI standards',
'Implementation challenges on PCI DSS', 'Interlink between PCI DSS, PA DSS
and OWAS Top Ten'. 

As a moderator of the OWASP group , you can consider circulating this to
OWASP Delhi Members. 

The details are available on http://www.sisa.co.in/PCI_DSS_
<http://www.sisa.co.in/PCI_DSS_Mumbai_Dec_2008.html> Mumbai_Dec_2008.html.  

Thanks and Regards,

Compliance to PCI-DSS or any PCI standard for that matter is driven by
 PCI SSC (PCI Security Standards Council). PCI itself is a council
composed of Visa, MasterCard, American Express etc. If there is no
incentive for PCI-DSS compliance in India (which I am not 100% sure
about) then it is because PCI-SSC is not actively enforcing it.

None of the PCI standards are legal requirements. In fact one of the
reasons the major credit card companies came together and mandated the
PCI set of standards is because they did not want the government to
step in with legislation which was inevitable in the light of the very
frequent credit card data losses taking place. The companies decided
to do it themselves since they would have more control over it and (I
like to believe) it makes more sense than the government doing it.

Compliance is just one mechanism to improve security and cannot catch
100% of the bad things out there. PCI-DSS captures some commonsense IT
best practices, it is definitely no magic dust but it is essential to
have commonsense captured in a formal manner and enforced. And PCI-DSS
like all standards have to be followed in the spirit and not just in
the letter for it to have real effect. Almost every standard I know of
can be bypassed by a company if it wanted to and still remain
compliant on paper.

By the way can anybody confirm that there is indeed no incentive in
India for merchants to be compliant to PCI-DSS?

Thanks.

Varun

I think certifying an application for being fully secured will remain tricky
and if at all there is any such certifying body, then trusting its
credibility would be difficult. Most of the service providers and compliance
like PCI refer to OWASP Top Ten. For me, a certificate to web application
can only suggest the attacks/checks performed in reference to OWASP, WASC or

As rightly said - the PCI DSS standard is for credit card data protection.
It is mandated by the Card industry which founded the standards. Compliance
is necessary by any entity processing, storing or transmitting credit card
info. However, the nature of audit depends on the volume of transaction. 6
million records and above have to go in for an onsite audit. Less than that
- a self assessment questionnaire needs to be filled up and vetted and sent
as compliance to PCI DSS. As far as I know, there is no merchant or service
provider in India who meet the requirement for an onsite audit.

 

Talking of standards - are there any standards for application security
against which they can be certified. Common Criteria is one but scope of CC
is much wider. Any ideas?

PCI DSS is a standard which was founded by visa, mastercard, am ex among
others. its purely a standard for protecting credit card data. I dont think
it would be prudent to have PCI DSS included in IT act or for that matter
including any standard in the IT act. Laws can not be goverened by standard
run by private intitutions. However since credit cards in india can only be
issued by banks, RBI can issue guidelines to banks to adhere to a set
acceptable standard. it could be PCI DSS or any other.

The PCI security Standard council, has fixed standard on who should undergo
certification under PCI DSS. As per my last understanding, any one
processing, storing, transmitting more than 6 million records annually needs
to have certification done. So merchants such as Shoppers Stop would come in
close. Banks such as SBI, ICICI and Citi would also fall under this
category. however adherance to this guidelines seems to be low. not sure
why. Since the certification is purely govered by this private institution,
it seems they have some exception process.

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta

PCI is not perfect but it greatly helps in protecting data.

I have done a PCI compliance check for one of my old clients.
My focus was on their applications, PCI is good in lot of areas like the 
emphasis on the encryption strength used, data storage security, sensitive 
data retenion or rather lack of it, Secure SDLC etc.
But then there are some not so good areas, like its gives an option 
between doing a Pentration Testing of the application or using a WAF 
instead.
Eventually it all comes down to the technical capability of the auditor, 
most auditors dont understand crypto and programming concepts.
There were instances in the audit where the developers tried to take me 
for a ride, had it not been for my programming background I would have 
missed out so many areas of concern.
A good friend of mine, who is also an auditor for PCI told me about an 
instance where the developer was using ROT-13 mixed with some more kiddie 
ideas for data storage and claimed his 'encryption' meet PCI standards, my 
friend was an ex-java dev so he spotted it.

Moral of the story, if you are checking yourself for PCI compliance then 
make sure the consultants you hire have the right skills for the job, else 
you might fail the certifying audit.
If the certifying auditor himself turns out to be a non-techie then God 
save our money ;)

There comes the point. I was also talking in similar context and you
clarified my point in a better way. Following a compliance checklist that
states password complexity, brute force protection, expiry, change, session
ID generation, encryption strength, stored procedures, data validation, blah
blah is all well acceptable and probably getting it compliant after a
thorough testing would also be achieved by some good auditor. 

 

But from customer's stand point, certifying the application for being 100%
secured and free from all sort of security flaws is the trickiest part. If I
would be a customer and find any such certifying body then I would surely
like to put a clause of few million dollars penalty if ever my application
or information being carried gets compromised by any mean. With the obvious
condition of, no changes in the code :-)

 

Moral of my story: "Compliance is not a security Nirvana!" ;)

Pay specific effort to evaluate how key management and encrypted data 
access are designed in the application architecture.

Can an external attacker transparently decrypt data without needing the 
key at all? Web applications might (highly possible) have functionality 
that allows for transparent encryption and decryption of data. Remember to 
evaluate how such transparent crypto functionality might stand up to 
common web application attacks. Will a successful [SQL|HTML] injection 
attack, return lots of unencrypted data because of crypto transparency? 
This scenario will be a very common one. But we have to assess how 
resilient the security architecture is, if there happens to be just one 
page with SQL Injection vulnerability in the future.

How resilient is the architecture towards internal attackers? How good 
would the encryption and key management be if we were to assume that a 
compromised laptop is plugged into the same network?

> If the certifying auditor himself turns out to be a non-techie then God 
save our money ;)
Thats a good point. In addition to tech skills, I would always recommend 
consultants who would approach the application as an adversary would. Dont 
hire a consultant who cant get his objective right. The PCI consultant's 
goal should not be evaluating whether the PCI Compliance certificate can 
hang in the auditee's reception. The goal should be to assess if the 
application design and implementation have any vulnerabilities that can 
lead to personally identifiable data.
 
Check out the consultant's approach to PCI audits. If it is mostly a 
checklist based one, with very little areas where the attacker thinks like 
an adversary, the results might affect only the auditee's reception :-)

Just my 2 cents. YMMV.

needs to have certification done. So merchants such as Shoppers Stop would 
come in close. Banks such as SBI, ICICI and Citi would also fall under 
this category. however adherance to this guidelines seems to be low. not 
sure why. Since the certification is purely govered by this private 
institution, it seems they have some exception process. 

Hope this is helpful

Hi List,

I know this is slightly off subject but then I thought it best to let the
experts decide.

Why is there no incentive for PCI DSS compliance in India? Is it because
there is no legal requirement for this?  I feel that this should be driven
by the vendors of credit/debit cards rather than merchants who have no
incentive to do so.  The amendments to IT Act 2000 are being discussed
now.  Shouldn't we lobby the NASSCOM or other such suitable body for
including PCI DSS compliance in the IT Act?

What are your opinions on this.

Thanks and regards

Subhash Dutta

Message-ID: <1499.121.241.121.178.1229321564.squirrel@www.kriss.in>

Hi List,

>From the varied responses that have been generated in response, I would
like to clarify one issue - while I am perfectly aware that mere
compliance with PCI DSS does not guarantee security of the transaction, in
the absence of any other "incentive" to security, this is the only
mechanism available today.  If the same companies (VISA, Mastercard, etc)
can comply to these standards abroad, what is the reason for them not to
insist on compliance in India for the same standards.  As a lot of you
have pointed out, this standard has been drawn up by the card vendors, so
the inventive must be on them to declare themselves as "PCI DSS
Certified".

My point about its inclusion in IT Act is just to ensure that.  It also
ensures that more people (and not just the security industry) are aware of
the requirements.

I will illustrate with an example.  In a Shopping Mall I got into an
argument with the sales staff who were swiping my card in their cash
register as well.  I asked if they could ensure the security of my
information entered into their terminal.  They obviously had no clue as to
what I was talking about.  I later got a call from one of their Security
personnel who assured me that all information is secure with them.  When I
asked on what this assurance was based and whether they had heard of ISO
27001 certification or even PCI DSS, the gentleman was totally lost and
promised to get back.  It has been three months now and I am not exactly
loosing any sleep waiting for his call.

My point is that most companies are not aware of the security risks
associated with e-business and most wouldn't care less.  Unless there is
some sort of mechanism in place that ensures compliance with some
standard, nobody will  even talk about security of information.

Regards

This is very critical issue w.r.t. national security. This is true that
government organizations lack best IT brains. There is awareness lack
also among the IT professionals on Information security. 
 
Information security should be introduced as a compulsory topic in

I agree. Surprising part is that our govt. officials were using third party
mailing services (gmail) for official communication. Don't they trust their
own mailing infrastructure for availability, security or high storage? If
not, then how can they trust third party mailing from security perspective.
Along with information security as compulsory topic in institutes, I think
all our govt. officials should undergo a solid information security
awareness course to understand the risk of their small and stupid mistakes.
For sure, cyber terrorism is on its rise!

Not only OWASP India but OWASP Global chapters are eager to help government
bodies. I and Puneet proposed and were chairing the working session on
"OWASP Intra Government Affairs" at OWASP EU Summit last month. We also
prepared a detailed presentation on it but unfortunately, couldn't
participate in this session which was well taken care by David Campbell.
Here is the link for the objective of that session:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Working_Session_-_OWASP_Intra_Governmen
tal_Affairs

 

We met a top decision making government official (I don't want to name
publicly) in this space some time back to propose such initiative, we also
keep sending personal invitations to govt. officials to participate in free
and open OWASP monthly meetings so that atleast we get a chance of
explaining and exploring such avenues, but then who cares! You know how it
goes here.

 

Post me offline if any one has got a wake-up bell for our govt. officials,
probably it might work with your suggestions.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

OWASP (All India chapters ) should pro-actively work with govt IT
organizations like NIC and all to develop awareness on Info Security at
lower level. OWASP (All India chapters) should work very closely with such
governing bodies for better IT Info & Infrastructure security management and
control as this cyber terrorism may lead to:

1. Financial attacks on banking & investment sites

2. National security strategy leak

3. Critical information leak

 

OWASP (All India Chapters) should present its plan and Infoemation security
concern to these Irresponsible Government bodies. I strongly believe that
our government need monthly public assessment on various areas to improve
its functioning.

I believe some clarifications are in order.

1.  Firstly this "Chinese attack" is an ongoing and fairly old attack
against *all* networks of major countries.  A number of countries have
reported surveillance of this nature.

2.  Right now they are concentrating their resources on gathering
information and disruption of networks have been reported.  However, this
is a minor issue as once you have gained access to a network,
disabling/disruption is trivial.

3.  The method of gaining access is through spear phishing by sending
targeted emails with infected attachments.

4.  The source of the attack has been traced either by email headers
indicating servers based in China or analysis of the malware which
uploads/communicates with the master servers based in China.

5.  Most of the times the malicious attachments have been detected by
antivirus at the service providers end or that installed on the host
machines.  Some however do pass through and then the infection spreads on
the internal networks through removable storage media, most popular being
USB Pen drives.  Some Pen Drives available at Nehru Place, New Delhi come
in capacities of 64 GB or even 80 GB and cost as low as Rs 500/- !! 
Making them a most lucrative item to own or to gift.  However, without
exception these are manufactured in China and contain embedded malware. 
These files are stored as hidden system files and are activated by using
the age-old autorun.inf method.

6.  Use of one or the other email providers has nothing to do with this
attack.  As has been rightly brought out, user awareness is the key.  Most
govt organisations have a policy of banning USB Pendrives in their
networks, but this policy is impractical, and therefore, rarely enforced. 
Most user's antivirus software is rarely updated and archaic govt
acquisition process ensure that by the time a latest version is acquired,
it is already obsolete.  There is no concept of host based firewalls on
and even if it is installed by an aware administrator, it is disabled by
the user as it is "too annoying".  After all, there is no patch for human
stupidity.

In continuation, those pen drives are not really 64 GB or 80 GB, it is
just clever marketing and obfuscation.  But it seems to be working as
these pen drives are flying off the shelves

ANNOUNCING THE NEW "OWASP TESTING GUIDE v3

OWASP is announcing the new OWASP Testing Guide v3. The project as
part of the OWASP Summer of Code, started on April 2008 reviewing the
version 2, improving it.
OWASP Testing Guide v3 is a 349 page book; we have split the set of
active tests in 9 sub-categories for a total of 66 controls to test
during the Web Application Testing activity.
Each control has an OWASP name, so for example a SQL Injection is
called: OWASP-DV-005, meaning that it is the 5th control of the Data
Validation category.
We got a dream team of 21 authors and 4 reviewers: after 6 months of
hard work and great team work we realized the v3.

We'd like to ask you to support OWASP to reach the following goals:

*** Continuously improve the guide.
The Guide is a "live" document: we always need your feedback!
Please join our testing mailing list and share your ideas:
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing

*** Promote the Testing Guide.
We would like to have some more media coverage on the guide, so
please, if you know somebody in there put them in touch.
If you have the chance, you can write an article about the Testing
Guide and the new OWASP Projects.
Also you can pick up the OWASP Testing Guide presentations and talk
about it in local conferences and Chapter meetings.
http://www.owasp.org/images/2/2c/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3
.ppt

*** Add 'quotes' to the Guide.
We made a special 'quotes' pages for the Testing Guide.
Here we'd want to add all the comments and references to the Guide.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_Quotes

The OWASP Testing Guide includes a "best practice" penetration testing
framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a
"low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for
testing most common web application and web service security issues.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Putting salted MD5 hashing into action
Message-ID: <44b2bd060812200534n675a90dfna870edb3f4eb49d7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

With respect to the last meet-up of OWASP Delhi at TCS, this technique was
talked about in detail however I was unable to put it into words on how it
can be achieved via programming. With a raw recruit knowledge on PHP I am
now successful in implementing this system and thought of sharing it with
you. Since it was not viable to put all code in this email so I have hosted
it on my blogspot.

Whomsoever interested can check out this small write-up on how to achieve
'Salted MD5 Hashing' for a secure authentication via programming. Hope this
wont be any issue and there would be no objection to anyone so to visit my
blogspot. Here you go:

some cool attacks from 2008

Psyche-cracking
      Yeah!!! You read it right.. now hackers dont want to hack your 
accounts, steal your information.. they want to emotionally hack you? the 
Gen Next Hacks
Idea is to take input from users Blog , photo sharing, Networking site 
info and posts feed the RSS from all those sources into a dashboard and 
Then exploit the user emotions to an advantage 
 
http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/11/hacking-the-psyche.html
 

   Permanent denial-of-service
 Dos attack on an application and a web server ?..Script Kiddie!!!!
Its caused by Phlashing..What pDoS does is attack on firmware and if 
attack us successful you will either have to reinstall everything or 
change your hardware.

   "Gecko" and the building system hack
 
Gecko intercepts a user's authentication entry data, letting an attacker 
steal or clone a user's entry credentials. Gecko, which is built with a 
Programmable Intelligent Computer (PIC) chip and circuits, targets the 
Wiegand protocols used by most readers to communicate with the access 
control systems.
 
Gecko -- which sits between the scanner and back-end access control system 
-- can capture, record, replay, and even disable the user's credentials 
after they scan their card through the reader. And that's just in its 
first version

The Coolest hack tool of 2008


iPhone as a hacking tool
As the Dark reading headline says 'Bringing Sexy Back' to Hacking
Hack on the move? Errata security shipped iPhone with wireless auditing 
tools. The iPhone can collect security data on the WiFi network, such as 
whether encryption is deployed and, if so, what type, as well as detecting 
rogue access points or laptops vulnerable to WiFi-borne hacks. There's an 
SSH connection to the iPhone so they can run the tests via a command line, 
too. 
Next, the researchers may attempt WiFi fuzzing on a Nokia N810 smartphone.

Welcome Siddhartha on the list. OWASP membership, material and tools are
free and open for everyone. You may download the material from the OWASP
website (www.owasp.org <http://www.owasp.org/> ) and start sharpening your
AppSec skills. In case you find any query or want to discuss something then
please feel free to post your queries on the list. We recently had chapter
meetings in October and November. You may find the presentations at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Delhi_Meeting_October_18th_2008 &
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Delhi_Meeting_November_29th_2008 

 

We dropped the idea of organizing the meeting for this month and most of us
would be busy in celebrating Christmas and New Year but we look forward to
have a meeting in next month. Stay tuned to this list for further details.

 

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone! Party time :-)

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv
