Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] Digest flag unchecked on all list subscribers
Message-ID: <CAE7ur0H9SowV5LqyyQgZc8HwoffgHFq5Nt3M34bWBfhcZET3Rg@mail.gmail.com>

While doing some maintenance work on OWASP-Delhi list, accidentally,
"digest" flag on all our list subscribers got disabled.

Request to re-enable this flag from this portal[0] in case you would like
OWASP-Delhi to send emails in digest form. FYI, we are very low noise list
~1 email per week and you may not need to enable this flag.

Apologies for the inconvenience.
