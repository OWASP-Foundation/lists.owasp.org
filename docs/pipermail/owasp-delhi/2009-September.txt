Message-ID: <b81186a60909070352s26bd5876q582c3de0264a2188@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I would like to share with you about an upcoming IEEE workshop on
Collaborative Security technologies. http://www.cosec-workshop.info/
Please do consider submitting your research/analytical work in the form of
technical papers for the workshop.
If you are interested in participating the workshop in some way (for e.g. a
demo or otherwise) or you would like more information, please do let me
know.

thanks
Samir

--------------------

Workshop on Collaborative Security Technologies (CoSec 2009)
in conjunction with the
3rd International Conference on
Internet Multimedia Systems Architecture and Application (IMSAA-09)
Bangalore, India
9 - 11 December 2009

The increasing number of Internet-scale threats is becoming a serious
concern for any organization which is connected to the Internet. With
decreasing large-scale computing and networking costs,attackers are
sufficiently equipped to carry out wide-ranged long-lived collaborative
attacks on a single target. Attackers have learned the power of
collaboration and knowledge-sharing, as proven by multiple cases wherein
similar attack code or patterns (albeit at different scales) have been used
to target individuals, small-medium businesses or large corporations alike.
The security community has always benefited from knowledge-sharing to work
together in developing sturdy solutions. Can a similar approach be applied
to define collaboration-based security technologies which can prove to be
more resistive against co-ordinated attacks? This workshop on Collaborative
Security Technologies (CoSec), aims to discuss whether an approach based on
the ?United we stand, but divided we fall? can be applied to security
technologies as well. This workshop is a first of its kind, focusing on
discussion of how a given security concept can be exponentially more useful
when used in a collaborative way across a given set of nodes, rather than
working in a stand-alone mode. Some of the technical areas wherein we
believe the collaborative nature of security technologies can be applicable
are as follows.

- Collaborative defence against DDoS attacks
- Collaborative approaches against web-based attack (phishing etc) detection
and protection
- Social networking-based collaboration for malware detection and
quarantining
- Collaborative Policies definition and enforcement across administrative
boundaries
- Collaborative responsibility for Privacy enforcement of multi-domain
information
- Collaborative forensics
- Collaboration within Govt. and Public Safety organizations against
national security concerns
- Collaborative or Distributed versions of well-known security protocols
- Multi-domain or Multi-technology-based collaboration for generating an
end-to-end views of a global or large-scale attack patterns and their
mitigation
- Augmentation methods for review of Security logs and information from
multiple sources

For more information please visit the conference web pages at
http://www.cosec-workshop.info/

The workshop welcomes papers in the standard double-column, IEEE format, but
in 10 pt font, and no longer than 6 pages (including all figures and
references).

Thanks Amar, there are many ISACA members on this list (Including Puneet) who should help ISACA fixing this problem.

By the way, existence of such common security problem in the website of ISACA made me curious to dig a bit further in terms of soft investigation (Not Exploitation ;-)). Their website footer contains "Powered By : www.mahalasainfo.com <http://www.mahalasainfo.com> ". Which reveals "Security challenges while outsourcing". I am sure by now, the trick must be known to everyone. Make a quick google search to see which websites are (so called) powered by that domain and you will find every website is vulnerable to SQL injection, there are over 20. I am too lazy to find the right contact and report those companies about their websites being vulnerable. If any company is known to members around here, then please help them by reporting the vulnerability.

Dear Dhruv,

 

Yes you are right, Even I have noticed that If a website is Build,  Powered By xyz Design Company is vulnerable then there is 90% chance that all the websites build, Powered by xyz are vulnerable for the same attack.

 

just remember one nice case , One of our clients website was vulnerable for SQL, Xss, Almost everything and at the time of patching it was total mess, because they had outsourced the design, construction, etc... to one design firm and that design firm terminated operations 1 year back and now there was no source code, no design documentation, no technology documentation at the client side. They just have one vulnerable website uploaded on server .........

 

 

As long as informing ISACA Mumbai goes, I did that 8 months ago in one chapter meet at Welingkar Mumbai, If you still want to try its ok.

 

And For other website, you can inform but people dont care, If its BFSI Sector company then its ok otherwise forget it, no one is going to care.

 

Regards,

 

Amar Wakharkar.
