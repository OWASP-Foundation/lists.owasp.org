> Please spread the word to those organizations you are involved in to raise awareness of these issues, particularly the new and unfamiliar A9: Using Known Vulnerable Components. With the rapid increase in the pace of development and the tempo of issuing new releases, it's getting even more challenging to avoid introducing these risks in modern applications. This rapid development tempo is also encouraging the increased use of 3rd party as well as internally developed components, which have security issues just like any other software. That's why A9 was introduced, to raise awareness that developers need to make sure they are not continuing to use components with known vulnerabilities.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] CFP Extended, Do it now!
Message-ID: <CA+Rr0=6cek_PW7mSobXq8uwPSrvhhfk5uHqicpzRqf+BShwBkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Good News for information security experts who couldn't yet submit their
papers for "OWASP InfoSec India Conference 2013" happening at Hotel Crowne
Plaza, Gurgaon, New Delhi NCR, India from August 30-31, 2013.

With few great papers submitted already, we would like to take this
opportunity to extend the CFP submission dates to 10 more days in order to
allow maximum participation.

CFP is now closing on June 25th, 2013, more details can be found at:
http://2013.owasp.in/category/cfp/

Don't miss out the opportunity to present your paper to a vibrant
information security community of CIOs, CISOs, investigators, policy
makers, INTs, defense, CERTs in the cyber city and national capital region
of India.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv Soi
Chair - OWASP India
