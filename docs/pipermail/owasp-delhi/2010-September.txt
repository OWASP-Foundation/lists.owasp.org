Subject: OWASP XSS CAMPAIGN

 

We ALL really hate XSS its a lame finding at this point for many..

 

Last night over beers in NYC there were a few smirks that PCI leader Visa
and other banks are "on the list" this week

 

http://xssed.com/archive/special=1 

 

See VISA (9/19/2010)

 

Instead of being part of a problem -- I rather be part of solutions that
benefit the OWASP global mission.

 

I propose AWARENESS WEEK starting right now -  WE globally make a effort to
raise some attention for OWASP Worldwide using this issue for a awareness
campaign on blogs, articles, twitter interviews etc.. get the word out.
By promotion of the "sexy hacked" headline news grabbing xss stuff we can
help raise awareness of local chapters - additional visibility for
application security (Our mission BTW) and once again reinforce that OWASP
Foundation is a lighthouse and resource for the concerned to attend our
events, read the guides.

 

This is how OWASP can "market" our professional association, gain more
respect from Industry as the good-guys here to help.

 

Knowledge: 

 

Conferences coming up -
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference

Local chapter meetings -
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Chapter#Local_Chapters

 

and projects in the works to help those that want help -
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_(O
WASP-DV-001) 

 

I know we are preaching to the choir at OWASP about XSS but the general
public is NOT AWARE OF THE IMPACT combined others from the Top 10 ie CSRF

 

Thank you in advance for getting on your soap box and contribution to this
awareness campaign.

Hi All,

Evercookie was developed by open source developer and security hacker Samy
Kamkar and it uses fairly simple web and browser technologies to make it
possible for sites, advertising networks and more nefarious people to add a
tracking cookie to your browser that will last, essentially, forever.
Evercookie does this by placing cookie data in several places within the
browser, including the standard cookie cache, browser history, even within a
specialized image file. Evercookie also utilizes new data storage features
in HTML 5.

In-depth details can be found @ *http://samy.pl/evercookie/*

Thanks,

Samy Kankar is not just any security hacker. He was the creator of the
infamous Samy worm which took down Myspace in 2005. His action brought XSS
to the mainstream.

I had seen it a few days ago, it definitely is scary as hell. Online privacy
is becoming difficult.

Another related way to track people is
panopticlick<https://panopticlick.eff.org/>.
This one doesn't set any cookies, but instead determines users on the basis
of various bits off information that the browser exposes. Things like
User-Agent, browser version, OS version, plugins installed, exact versions
of plugins, default language, IP address and so on are unique enough to
track a person.

Hi,

Wanted to check if we have any document which maps out Web Application
Firewall to the threats it should mitigate?

Also any document which provides benefits and negatives of implementing WAF
would be really great.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards

Gautam

FYI.....An addon of firefox to delete Flash's Local shared objects/ Flash
cookies : Better privacy

Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6623/

Or probably you can delete them manually from C:\Documents and Settings\*
USERNAME*\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player\#SharedObjects
