*Title: AppSec Testing Beyond Pen Test by Bhushan Gupta*

*Abstract:* Web application security has a broad scope that spans from
network communication to browser behaviors to backend applications and
finally to database servers. Validating security of all these components
can be a daunting task and take a considerable effort. Penetration is the
most prevalent testing method used today for validating web application
security. The question is, &#8220;does it cover all the basis?&#8221; Penetration
testing is a black-box type testing that a QA engineer applies from the
hacker&#8217;s perspective. While it provides a comfort level, it does not ensure
that the application has been developed with security in mind and that it
meets the three basic requirements of security namely, Confidentiality,
Integrity, and Availability (CIA). The CIA framework builds intrinsic
security and thus ensures an increased confidence level. This framework
should be complemented with the penetration testing.

This talk focuses on how to align the security validation of a web
application with the three basic elements of security namely,
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). The test effectiveness
can be achieved by analyzing the requirements of each element and
identifying the potential breaches that can compromise each element. The
efficiency should be built by relating these breaches with the known OWASP
Top 10 and other vulnerabilities and, leveraging that knowledge to identify
the testing approach - static and dynamic throughout the SDLC.
