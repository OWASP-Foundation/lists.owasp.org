 JOIN US FORTHE MOST COMPREHENSIVE WORKSHOP ON SECURITY IN DEVOPS

You are in the fast lane. Your products are being delivered in lightning
fast speeds, going from requirement to deployment at a rapid pace. You may
be leveraging DevOps practices like Continuous Integration, Continuous
Deployment
and Continuous Delivery, but the what stops you is a Continual, Consistent
and a Seamless Application Security process.

Security flaws come in between you and a smooth DevOps lifecycle. They
cause serious problems, in the form of *endless fix iterations, irate
customers, outages, product overruns and multiple vendor management issues* to
name a few. In addition, traditional models of application security such as
an end-of-the-chain activity like a one time Penetration Test often results
in a huge strain on the operating resources and an increase in the mean
time to deployment.

What if there was a way to integrate Security into your DevOps process?
What if *DevOps became SecDevOps?*

Subject: [OWASP-Delhi] Brute-force file decryptioin
In-Reply-To: <CAG-UC=188rPdnPBhsir3JpSgFfD31EaJozGxoDN0u1eLh3DhZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I've come to face the difficult (or impossible) task of decrypting a file
encrypted using AES-256. Was wondering if any of you would have some
helpful suggestions to impart.

It's a windows-based software (SafeGuard Portable from Sophos). It asks for
a password for file decryption. Unfortunately, the owner of the files has
misplaced the password and has contacted me for help. I've informed him of
the sheer difficulty in computing the possibilities (32 char passphrase)
and my lack of expertise in the same. Also, I do not have access to any
specialised hardware for super fast computing. So the only sane option for
me is to brute force it using an intelligent dictionary- created from
permutations and combinations of all strings that the person considers as
valid candidates for the password.

Now, the question is whether there are tools that allow me to generate the
intelligent dictionary (created as mentioned above), submit entries in it
to the windows software one by one (no command line options or APIs
available for this software as per my research) and can recognise it if a
successful decryption happens. Please suggest any practical solution and
correct me if my approach is wrong.

Thanks & Regards,
Reuben Kurien

*PROJECTS: Announcing GSoC 2016, New Releases from OWASP ZSC, ESAPI,
WebGoat 7, and a ZAP User Survey*

*Got an Idea for Google Summer of Code 2016?*

The time of the year has come to propose ideas for GSoC 2016.

We haven't been selected yet, but we need to populate this list of ideas as
part of the organization application process.

We have created a list here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSOC2016_Ideas
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/174264e7b2/f385211697/utm_content=&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eowasp%2Eorg%2Findex%2Ephp%2FGSOC2016_Ideas&utm_campaign=February%202016%20Community%20News%20Flash>

We have removed last year's ideas and only left some as "example ideas".
Please add more ideas to this list as you wish. You should put your ideas
down before the application deadline, ie before February 19th. You will be
able to add more idea after the deadline but we would like to present to
Google as many ideas as possible.

*OWASP ZSC*

We are preparing to start developing a powerful obfuscation tool OWASP ZSC
and looking for some volunteers to contribute the tool project.

OWASP ZSC Project
OWASP ZSC is an open source software in python language which lets you
generate customized shellcodes and convert scripts to an obfuscated script.
This software can be run on Windows/Linux/OSX under python.

Usage of shellcodes
Shellcodes are small codes in assembly which could be use as the payload in
software exploiting. Other usages are in malwares, bypassing anti viruses,
obfuscated codes and etc.

Usage of Obfuscate Codes
Can be use for bypassing antiviruses, code protections, same stuff etc?

Why use OWASP ZSC ?
According to other shellcode generators such as metasploit tools and etc,
OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect.
OWASP ZSC encoders are able to generate shellcodes with random encodes that
lets you to get thousands of new dynamic shellcodes with the same job in
just a second, it means you will not get a same code if you use random
encodes with same commands, and that makes OWASP ZSC one of the bests!
otherwise it's going to generate shellcodes for other operation systems in
the next versions. It?s the same story for the code obfuscation.

There are more details about how it works and user guides
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/174264e7b2/17d4d5d4ac>
and also how to develop

*WebGoat*

Webgoat v.7 released. Listen to our podcast
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/174264e7b2/83f302441d>
as Bruce Mayhew explains the new version. The WebGoat Project started 10
years ago and has had over 1,000,000 downloads. Version 7.0 is being
released this week. Matt Miller caught with Bruce Mayhew, project lead, to
talk about the history of the project, what has been updated in version 7,
and what he foresees as the future of this project. Project Page:

*New ESAPI Release*

ESAPI project co-leader, Kevin Wall announced his team has just tagged (and
signed) a new ESAPI release. The tag name is esapi-2.1.0.1. There are 36
GitHub issues that were closed. You can find full details at:
https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/master/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.1.0.1-release-notes.txt
.

Note that there are also some important changes made to the GitHub repo
itself. Specifically, we have chosen to adopt a git workflow based on this
blog: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/174264e7b2/dd7765f039>,
where all the new development work will be done on the 'develop' branch and
the 'master' branch will henceforth reflect the latest official ESAPI
release.

To accommodate this,

   - The 'develop' branch has now been made the DEFAULT branch.
   - The 'master' branch has now been made a PROTECTED branch.

Chris Schmidt will be uploading this to Maven sometime later this day,
probably once he's through with his day job. Lastly, a special shout-out to
Matt Seil and Jeremiah Stacey for their help with Git and some nasty JUnit
concurrency issues.


*ZAP User Survey*

Please help us to make @owasp ZAP even better for you by answering the ZAP

*EVENTS: Upcoming AppSec Events*

<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/174264e7b2/51bee3e7f2>

The European OWASP Conference is going to be one of the best ever.
Come to hear and share ideas with the experts!
27 June - 1 July 2016

Read the latest news on the next *OWASP AppSecEU* on the conference site:
http://2016.appsec.eu/
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/174264e7b2/097d656140>

Important keynote speakers will be present at the Marriott Park Hotel in
Rome, Italy. Our special guest will be Charlie Miller, who will present the
keynote talk "Bugs ruin everything". In his speech, Miller will discuss
some popular methods for finding vulnerabilities and why it is so difficult
to spot them.

*Charlie Miller is a senior security engineer at Uber ATC, a hacker, and a
gentleman.* Back when he still had time to research, he was the first with
a public remote exploit for both the iPhone and the G1 Android phone. He is
a four-time winner of the CanSecWest Pwn2Own competition. He has authored
three information security books and holds a PhD from the University of
Notre Dame. He has hacked browsers, phones, cars, and batteries.

The *Open Web Application Security Project* is an open-source project for
application security. OWASP provides advice on the creation of secure
Internet applications and testing guides.

It boasts a strong global community with more than 45,000 participants,
more than 55 corporate members and 20 academic supporters through 249
active local chapters in 6 continents and 97 countries.

More than 800 people are expected at the event, with 3 days of training
followed by the 2-day conference that includes:

   - Five parallel talks with focus on the OWASP core mission (Dev, Ops,
   Hack, CISO and Research);
   - Keynotes from industry leaders;
   - Exhibition spaces that offer innovative solutions for the needs of
   companies.

Do not miss the opportunity to participate this important conference,
mentioned in Tripwire as a TOP 11 SECURITY CONFERENCE IN 2016
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/be9a26312a/174264e7b2/d971013ace>
.

More details on registration, program and speakers will be sent in a
forthcoming communication.

is #10

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration
testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is
designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and
as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to
penetration testing. ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of
tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.

OWASP OWTF is a project focused on penetration testing efficiency and
alignment of security tests to security standards like: The OWASP Testing
Guide (v3 and v4), the OWASP Top 10, PTES and NIST.

#2 of our 2016 Strategic Goals
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/174264e7b2/ec52f470ae/utm_content=&utm_source=VerticalResponse&utm_medium=Email&utm_term=%232%20of%20our%202016%20Strategic%20Goals&utm_campaign=OWASP%20Foundation%20%7C%20February%202016%20Connector>
is to become more involved in the Developer community. We are pleased to
report tremendous turnout for our recent outreach events, Codemash in
chilly Ohio and AppSec California in sunny Santa Monica.

CodeMash
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/174264e7b2/70123d48f3>
is a unique event that seeks to educate developers on current practices,
methodologies, and technology trends in a variety of platforms and
development languages such as Java, .NET, Ruby, Python and PHP.

A breakdown of this tremendous event:

   - 2500 attendees
   - 1000 kids
   - 202 speakers
   - 84 staff
   - 280 sessions


Sessions included 40 hours of security content, with 2 days of training by
Jim Manico and Bill Sempf.

OWASP Foundation participated as a Gold level sponsor. Bill Sempf, the
project leader of the OWASP .NET Project and chapter leader for OWASP
Columbus, served on the Session Committee helping to review over 1000
submissions. We have been proud to partner with Codemash over the past two
years and are seeking similar opportunities worldwide.

AppSec California
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/243e672b0e/174264e7b2/75715dbf94>
is a one of a kind experience for information security professionals,
developers, and QA and testing professionals, as they gather at the beach
from around the world to learn and share knowledge and experiences about
secure systems and secure development methodologies. The third annual event
taking place last month fulfilled all expectations bridging the local
application security and developer communities for a beautiful weekend on
the California coast.

*OWASP ZSC Project*

OWASP ZSC is an open source software in python language which lets you
generate customized shellcodes and convert scripts to an obfuscated script.
Shellcodes are small codes in assembly which could be use as the payload in
software exploiting. Other usages are in malwares, bypassing anti viruses,
obfuscated codes and etc. Obfuscate codes can be use for bypassing
antiviruses, code protections, same stuff, etc. This software can be run on
Windows/Linux/OSX under python.

Why use OWASP ZSC?
According to other shellcode generators such as metasploit tools and etc,
OWASP ZSC using new encodes and methods which antiviruses won't detect.
OWASP ZSC encoders are able to generate shellcodes with random encodes that
lets you to get thousands of new dynamic shellcodes with the same job in
just a second, it means you will not get a same code if you use random
encodes with same commands, and that makes OWASP ZSC one of the bests!
otherwise it's going to generate shellcodes for other operation systems in
the next versions. It?s the same story for the code obfuscation.
