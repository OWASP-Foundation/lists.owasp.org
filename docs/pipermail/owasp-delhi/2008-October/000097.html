<PRE>Gents,
All good points. Though, call it scepticism or just paranoia (given the
field we are in), I concur with Sunil in that it seems a bit odd that 
 
1. A high ranking Gov. official would email to only the Delhi OWASP
list. One would think that this would be a broader initiative (I hang
out in quite a few security lists and haven't seen any equivalent
email). Although, it could be and we dont have the bigger picture in
front of us.
2. A high ranking Gov. official would float his contact info on a public
forum like this. 
3.  A high ranking Gov. official would email using his gmail id. (Point
raised by Sunil)
 
But putting these speculations aside, not to go on a tangent and steal
the thunder away from the real issue, I think everyone would appreciate
some more &quot;transparency&quot; (unless some list members (Pukhraj, Druv?) have
already met/spoken to Mr. Alok or have some deeper insight into this
initiative, which makes this a mute point) in this matter to extend
their co-operation. 
 
Mr. Alok - We are all ears. Help us help India.
 
thanks,

  - Jitesh Kamat

	Greetings Sunil,
	
	While I understand your concern for unscrupulous activities
which happen under the broad definition of hacking, I think tagging this
term as something which is explicitly criminal is unfair and
uncalled-for. Hacking has very intellectual roots and a long-long
history, and if you give the government the liberty of not getting
swayed by the media and populist propaganda (FUD - fear, uncertainty and
doubt), then you can see that there is a genuine scope of cooperation
here. 
	
	When the President of US wanted an overhaul of cyber security
and critical infrastructure protection apparatus, they invited hackers,
yes hackers like L0pht's Mudge AKA Peiter Zatko to testify in the
Congress. Let's move over the myopic scope of jargon put forth by the
populist media and FUD-mongers and call hackers as hackers, and not
black hat, white hat, ethical or some other self-gratifying term.
	
	My 2 cents with Alok. It's an initiative for which we will thank
him in the coming years, unless of course you want an short-sighted
action from the government like declaring wi-fi as illegal or something.
	
	Best,
	Pukhraj

		Dear Shri Alok Vijayant
		 
		You have refered the use of hacker for government
purpose. Penetration testing with permission is ethical thing but doing
the same without permission is not ethical. In OWASP we are together to
help each other in removing the vulnerabilities from application and not
developing malwares.
		 
		If you are really doing this on governemt behalf then
why not send mail using your official mail ID. 
		It will be easy for others to cooperate.

			Hello All,
			Government has come up with a plan to use active
hands on hackers for purposes relating to national security.
			It has been planned to invite all such hackers
from various parts of the country who could be helpful in ensuring
security and integrity of the nation.
			I have been assigned the responsibility to
provide a platform where such interactions among law enforcement
agencies, national security agencies and the professioanl hackers could
take a shape.
			 
			I invite personal mails to me from individual
hackers who wish to participate in a one to one interaction with the
agencies.
			 
			The meet would be scheduled some time in the end
of october or beginning of November.
			 
			Please feel free to contact me - 
			 
			Alok Vijayant
			Deputy Secretary
			Government of India
