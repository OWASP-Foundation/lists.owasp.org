<PRE>Hi Harpreet,

To be honest I think this entire &quot;two-factor authentication&quot; project
has very shaky fundamentals. It is just one-factor authentication with
lot of stuff added on which &quot;feels&quot; like two-factor but is probably
not even good one-factor.

The user does not seem to be authenticated any more strongly that your
usual web registration, same band is used to deliver tokens for both
authentication mechanisms, the tokens are stored in an extremely weak
repository - the cookie, core design uses secret questions to
accommodate changing PCs, solution will not degrade gracefully and
many more. Also remember that cookies set by a particular server are
always sent by the browser when that site/server is visited so
anything you store in a cookies is more exposed than data sitting in a
file on your disk.

Here are a collection of quick links that illustrate what I am trying
to say. I want to pen a much longer email but unfortunately I do not
have the time right now, will try to do it later this week.

The Curse of the Secret Question

Soft tokens aren't tokens at all

The Failure of Two-Factor Authentication

More on Two-Factor Authentication
<A HREF="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/04/more_on_twofact.html">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/04/more_on_twofact.html</A>

Two-factor, especially OTP generators are expensive but there are a
no. of less expensive still decent enough solutions available.
Consider the grid (debit) cards used by ICICI, also consider the grid
card shown here. You can also use SMSes for out of band authentication
for high value transactions, though of course there are pros and cons
to each solution.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further to my previous mail regarding my project on Authentication. Please
</I>&gt;<i> find below a brief writeup of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The project is based on a research paper published on &quot;providing Two
</I>&gt;<i> factor authentication&quot; by one of our colleagues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second factor is considered as smart card (Javacard) in the paper. But
</I>&gt;<i> as the cost of Javacard is high we have decided to simulate the smart card
</I>&gt;<i> as SMART CARD FILE which is at present a txt file generated after each
</I>&gt;<i> successful registration and containing the resultant hash computations.
</I>&gt;<i> In actual implementation with hardware based smart card the authors
</I>&gt;<i> proposed to issue a personalized smart card to each registered user
</I>&gt;<i> through reliable channel (courier etc.). The personalization here includes
</I>&gt;<i> some computations such as hash functions, XOR operations done using the
</I>&gt;<i> user credentials (userID , password)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Registration Phase
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the time of registration, once the user finishes his registration
</I>&gt;<i> formalities and submits it to the server, the server does some secret
</I>&gt;<i> computations and writes it in a smart card file which is to be delivered
</I>&gt;<i> to the registered user (according to the paper). But since we can't expect
</I>&gt;<i> every user to have a removable media such as thumb drive etc. to download
</I>&gt;<i> the software smart card, we are writing the file contents in the cookie
</I>&gt;<i> and storing it on the user system. Moreover, if the user at registration
</I>&gt;<i> time says that he is registering from a public place (cyber caf etc) then
</I>&gt;<i> the cookie will be stored on the system for limited time period say 6 hrs
</I>&gt;<i> before it automatically gets expired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Login Phase
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At login, if the user is accessing the account from his own PC, he enters
</I>&gt;<i> his userID which is verified locally with contents of the cookie. If local
</I>&gt;<i> verification is successful then the client sends it to server for
</I>&gt;<i> validation. Upon successful validation at server, the server sends the
</I>&gt;<i> password page where in the user enters his password which is also locally
</I>&gt;<i> verified. After password verification, the client prepares a secret
</I>&gt;<i> message using the validated values and sends it to the server. The server
</I>&gt;<i> does validate it before providing the access to account.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If every time the user logs in from different systems then after user
</I>&gt;<i> enters the ID, the system checks if his cookie is present. If it is not
</I>&gt;<i> available then the server asks some secret questions (questions which are
</I>&gt;<i> usually asked if user forgets password) to be answered by the user. If
</I>&gt;<i> answers are correct then the server loads the smart card file as cookie
</I>&gt;<i> from its backup to the client. The rest of the process of asking the user
</I>&gt;<i> to enter password etc. follows as discussed above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> MY PREVIOUS MAIL FOR REFERENCE
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I am currently developing an authentication project in Java which
</I>&gt;<i>  requires few of the user credentials to be stored on client after
</I>&gt;<i>  successful registration. This is to enable the client to locally
</I>&gt;<i>  verify the userID and do other necassary computations before it is being
</I>&gt;<i> sent
</I>&gt;<i>  to server. As of now, I am storing these in default cookies location
</I>&gt;<i>  at client. But if the user has disabled the  cookie option or clears
</I>&gt;<i>  the cookies then the authentication process cannot proceed. We are
</I>&gt;<i>  thinking that we can store the cookie in some other location other
</I>&gt;<i>  than the default location.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In view of the above I have two queries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1) Is there any way to store the cookie in some different secret location
</I>&gt;<i> (such
</I>&gt;<i>     as windows system directory etc.) from where the cookie can be read at
</I>&gt;<i> login time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2) If we want to store the cookie in different location then how we
</I>&gt;<i> cannot identify
</I>&gt;<i>     the type of operating system running at client (as Linux as client
</I>&gt;<i> will have some
</I>&gt;<i>     different directory)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I request you to kindly take some time out to give the best solution
</I>&gt;<i>  for the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks &amp; Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Harpreet
