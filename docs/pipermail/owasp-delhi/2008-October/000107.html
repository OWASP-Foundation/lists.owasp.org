*Crossing the Chasm: Anatomy of Client-Side and Browser-Based Attacks*

* *

The last couple of years have witnessed a sea-change in the Internet threat
landscape. Not only has the cyber-crime model been heavily monetized, but
the attacks vectors have also become more and more sophisticated. One
category of exploitation which has upped the ante is client-side and
browser-based exploitation.



&gt;<i>From humble beginnings like the WMF debacle, attackers have come a long way
</I>in luring unaware users into their vicious trap. Now, we see almost
business-like precision and efficiency in such shady dealings. From
thousands of malicious websites serving plethora of obfuscated exploits
cropping up everyday, to the compromise of popular and critical websites
which end up becoming the gateway of such nefarious activities, never before
has the Internet security community born the brunt of something so organized
and wide-scale.



Having investigated hundreds of such 'in-the-wild' cases and being at the
helm of affairs during incidents of global outbreak (WMF zero-day, IE VML
vulnerability, MPack automated exploitation toolkits, ANI zero-day, Xunlei
WebThunder zero-day, Peacomm propagation; to investigating the compromise of
websites of Indian government agencies like Defense Research and Development
Organization) has given Pukhraj a multifaceted view of the problem. It has
lend him a unique perspective as to why this is such a hard nut to crack &#8211;
why contemporary security products fail in such situations, the modus
operandi of selling exploits in the underground, the escalation of
cyber-espionage, to the underlying architectural deficiencies in client-side
applications and browsers.



Pukhraj will share some his war-zone stories giving you an enthralling view,
right from the foxhole.
