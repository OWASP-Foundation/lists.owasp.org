<PRE>Greetings All,

We are looking for active collaboration with various tier-1 service
providers and large academic/research/corporate networks ( &gt;1000 nodes), to
join hands in building a nation-wide early-warning and actionable threat
intelligence platform. Our motive is not to build some kind of commercial
service, but to provide and share real-time intelligence for free with
various contributors and partners. We believe that this will set a good
precedent in tracking security incidents and attacks against our national
infrastructure.

To get a brief overview on the project, you can visit the following page:
<A HREF="http://www.vikriya.com/products/trikaal">http://www.vikriya.com/products/trikaal</A> (Especially, read about A-NAME).

To make Anomalous Network Activity Mining Engine (A-NAME) more precise and
actionable, we need logs - tons and tons of logs from various kinds of
networks. We will crunch it, mine it and gather some really cool
intelligence and statistics out of it, apart from other avenues like smart
honeynets etc. We will corroborate and link-together all this information
from various tracking modules, to produce real-time data on various kinds of
attack statistics, which can be browsed through a slick Web 2.0-like portal.
We assure you that we will fully adhere to confidentiality issues and will
strip payload/content of the traffic completely, if needed. Our system can
do some nice heuristics from the packet header data itself. Such
collaboration will be done under a bulletproof NDA to avoid any
confidentiality leaks. Our sensors will have a zero-footprint on your
network and all data gathering will be done completely passively, so no
interventions.

I urge you mail me if you think you can contribute or can refer us to the
right people who can help. In return, you will not only get attack and
anomaly statistics from A-NAME, but also some really valuable information
and cutting-edge research on zero-days, new vulnerabilities, botnets,
phishing, malware, exploits and other security happenings from our threat
research analyst team. In short, if you contribute for one module, we will
give you returns from all the modules for free. We also hope to make this
system open to the general public later on.

Best,
Pukhraj Singh
