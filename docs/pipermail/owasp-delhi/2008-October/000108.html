</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The last couple of years have witnessed a sea-change in the Internet threat
</I>&gt;<i> landscape. Not only has the cyber-crime model been heavily monetized, but
</I>&gt;<i> the attacks vectors have also become more and more sophisticated. One
</I>&gt;<i> category of exploitation which has upped the ante is client-side and
</I>&gt;<i> browser-based exploitation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From humble beginnings like the WMF debacle, attackers have come a long way
</I>&gt;<i> in luring unaware users into their vicious trap. Now, we see almost
</I>&gt;<i> business-like precision and efficiency in such shady dealings. From
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of malicious websites serving plethora of obfuscated exploits
</I>&gt;<i> cropping up everyday, to the compromise of popular and critical websites
</I>&gt;<i> which end up becoming the gateway of such nefarious activities, never before
</I>&gt;<i> has the Internet security community born the brunt of something so organized
</I>&gt;<i> and wide-scale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having investigated hundreds of such 'in-the-wild' cases and being at the
</I>&gt;<i> helm of affairs during incidents of global outbreak (WMF zero-day, IE VML
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerability, MPack automated exploitation toolkits, ANI zero-day, Xunlei
</I>&gt;<i> WebThunder zero-day, Peacomm propagation; to investigating the compromise of
</I>&gt;<i> websites of Indian government agencies like Defense Research and Development
</I>&gt;<i> Organization) has given Pukhraj a multifaceted view of the problem. It has
</I>&gt;<i> lend him a unique perspective as to why this is such a hard nut to crack &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> why contemporary security products fail in such situations, the modus
</I>&gt;<i> operandi of selling exploits in the underground, the escalation of
</I>&gt;<i> cyber-espionage, to the underlying architectural deficiencies in client-side
</I>&gt;<i> applications and browsers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pukhraj will share some his war-zone stories giving you an enthralling
</I>&gt;<i> view, right from the foxhole.

</I>&gt;<i> leverage the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Prior to Vikriya, he was working with Symantec Canada, as a member of the
</I>&gt;<i> industry's foremost and well-respected global security response and
</I>&gt;<i> actionable intelligence team responsible for managing the Symantec's
</I>&gt;<i> flagship service, The DeepSight Threat Management System. Prior to that, he
</I>&gt;<i> was the Project Manager and Chief Vulnerability Researcher at Third Brigade,
</I>&gt;<i> where he established their Indian security research base from ground up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a security professional, he has played varied roles in the past, from
</I>&gt;<i> working on the industry's first patch proxy IPS at Blue Lane Technologies to
</I>&gt;<i> performing penetration tests on leading banks and portals. He has spoken at
</I>&gt;<i> international security conferences (Hack-In-The-Box 2005,
</I>&gt;<i> CII-PricewaterhouseCoopers Business Security Summit, SyScAN 2005), academic
</I>&gt;<i> institutions, technology meets and professional security boot camps. His
