<PRE>Mohammed,

&gt;<i> But we came to know that some of the signatures by commercial vendors are
</I>not released in open source domain and we need to go for paid subscription
for that.

That's correct. The quality of signatures in the public domain is pretty
shabby, leading to a lot of false positives and negatives. The reason being
that most of it is volunteer effort with limited details on the exact nature
of the vulnerability being covered. To access better and precise signatures,
you would have to pay the price.

&gt;<i> In view of this, Can anyone help me with providing references to such commercial
</I>vendors who provide paid subscription to IDS/IPS signatures. Our management
is ready to invest in &gt; that.

My company, Vikriya (www.vikriya.com) has just come out of stealth mode. We
are working on similar lines, and do active research and signature
development on new vulnerabilities and threats. We are have also prototyped
a multi-vendor vulnerability signature auto-push engine which works for
Snort too (vStrobe). Apart from that, our on-demand vulnerability management
platform (Genghis) and actionable threat intelligence portal (Trikaal) also
have an active database of threats, vulnerabilities and exploits.

Let me know if there's an avenue of cooperation here. We are looking for
mutually beneficial partnerships in feeding intelligence to Trikaal and
making our attack trends forecast more precise and actionable.

Best,

Pukhraj Singh
