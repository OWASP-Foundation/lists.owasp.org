<PRE>&gt;<i> Er. Sushil.
</I>

My bad!

&gt;<i> You have refered the use of hacker for government purpose. Penetration
</I>testing with permission is ethical thing but doing the same
&gt;<i> without permission is not ethical. In OWASP we are together to help each
</I>other in removing the vulnerabilities from application and not
&gt;<i> developing malwares.
</I>

I collated two different aspects to counter not only Sushil's criticism, but
also the kind of feedback we've been getting offline. Deconstructing
Sushil's aforementioned paragraph, you can say that he's criticizing the
call for the open use of hackers or it could be related to the use of the
term 'hacker' (I am not sure due to some syntactic obscurity in the mail).
In the next sentence, he is apprehensive about hackers doing some intrusive
tests to check the susceptibility of critical infrastructure.

My point here is, we can learn a lot of from US policy on such issues. It
started the typical way, with L0pht declaring that they can bring down the
Internet in 30 minutes (due to a BGP hack), then these hackers doing
'penetration tests without permission' were called on by the government.
This was the first step in making of US cyber security policy. We are going
to witness same amount of connectivity here in India in the coming decade,
with control systems like SCADA becoming more prevalent. Let's learn, adapt
and move quickly. Being proactive is a hell lot cheaper then refurbishing
the whole goddamn vulnerable architecture. And on Alok's stance on the open
use of hackers (no hats barred), I say let's give them a direction and we
will get poster boys like l0pht, cDc, w00w00, Peiter Zatko, Marc Maiffret,
Kevin Poulsen, Chris Claus etc, of whom we will be proud of.

I criticized Sushil because for me, his mail symbolizes all that is
stereotypical and un-entrepreneurial about the government. While on the
other hand, I admire Alok's contrarian approach.

I won't stretch this too far...you can draw any conclusion you may like. I
am just keen on supporting Alok.

Best,
Pukhraj
