<PRE>Hi Harpreet,
 I'm Arjun and I designed a single sign on and registration server. So will try to use that experience to help as best I can undertsand.
 
 I think the approach requires re-validation of concepts. I've NOT mentioned how to do what you want, but probably a different way of doing things to achieve the same desired functionality.
 
You did not mention, ...but from cookie I assume your client is ONLY a Web Browser.
Having, assumed that; one has to respect the intention of a cookie and the requirement of the user to disable or remove it. By trying to find ways to prevent that, I as a user would be very upset OR Happy if I was a hacker and could derive valuable info from your cookie.
 
If it is a public site, your credibility is at risk where you try to find ways to work around the user having control over the cookies on their machine. I'd advise on any approach that leaves a bad taste is the user found out.
PLUS: When this may not be secure, you may be saving information; if copied could spoof the user and cause a vulnerability in your system.
You said 
&lt;QUOTE&gt;This is to enable the client to locally
  verify the userID and do other necassary computations before it is being
sent&lt;/QUOTE&gt;
... what sort of 'computations' are you trying to avoid? If these are so complex, then you are trying to save a LOT of data on the cookie. Which is a very bad thing from a vulnerability perspective. The solution below, excludes this comment because I'm not clear of &quot;computations&quot; and I find it shady!
So what is the soluton? (excluding the requirement of doing complex computations)
Instead of trying to make this invisible to your user. Why not maintain all the information in the database against some ID/Pin. When the user registers, display the PIN or send an Email (Click on this link - the link contains the pin in non-encrypted or encrypted format as a parameter).
Actually; if your params can be put in a link then EMAIL is the best way. Putting the link in an EMAIL will provide a way of the process to be with users knowledge and consent.
 
Either way, commuinicate to the user that for their confidentiality the next time they visit the site that PIN should be used.
 
If it is an application for a specific client; you may want to work on a buy in from business that mandates the use of cookies on user machines. And since they know your application they can trust it.
 
Regards,
Arjun

	Hi All,
	
	  I am currently developing an authentication project in Java which
	  requires few of the user credentials to be stored on client after
	  successful registration. This is to enable the client to locally
	  verify the userID and do other necassary computations before it is being
	sent
	  to server. As of now, I am storing these in default cookies location
	  at client. But if the user has disabled the  cookie option or clears
	  the cookies then the authentication process cannot proceed. We are
	  thinking that we can store the cookie in some other location other
	  than the default location.
	
	  In view of the above I have two queries.
	
	  1) Is there any way to store the cookie in some different secret location
	(such
	     as windows system directory etc.) from where the cookie can be read at
	login time.
	
	  2) If we want to store the cookie in different location then how we
	cannot identify
	     the type of operating system running at client (as Linux as client
	will have some
	     different directory)
	
	  I request you to kindly take some time out to give the best solution
	  for the same.
	
	Thanks &amp; Regards
	Harpreet
	C-DAC
