<PRE>Hi,

Further to my previous mail regarding my project on Authentication. Please 
find below a brief writeup of the project.


The project is based on a research paper published on &quot;providing Two 
factor authentication&quot; by one of our colleagues.



The second factor is considered as smart card (Javacard) in the paper. But 
as the cost of Javacard is high we have decided to simulate the smart card 
as SMART CARD FILE which is at present a txt file generated after each 
successful registration and containing the resultant hash computations. 
In actual implementation with hardware based smart card the authors 
proposed to issue a personalized smart card to each registered user 
through reliable channel (courier etc.). The personalization here includes 
some computations such as hash functions, XOR operations done using the 
user credentials (userID , password)



Registration Phase

At the time of registration, once the user finishes his registration 
formalities and submits it to the server, the server does some secret 
computations and writes it in a smart card file which is to be delivered 
to the registered user (according to the paper). But since we can't expect 
every user to have a removable media such as thumb drive etc. to download 
the software smart card, we are writing the file contents in the cookie 
and storing it on the user system. Moreover, if the user at registration 
time says that he is registering from a public place (cyber caf etc) then 
the cookie will be stored on the system for limited time period say 6 hrs 
before it automatically gets expired.



Login Phase

At login, if the user is accessing the account from his own PC, he enters 
his userID which is verified locally with contents of the cookie. If local 
verification is successful then the client sends it to server for 
validation. Upon successful validation at server, the server sends the 
password page where in the user enters his password which is also locally 
verified. After password verification, the client prepares a secret 
message using the validated values and sends it to the server. The server 
does validate it before providing the access to account.



If every time the user logs in from different systems then after user 
enters the ID, the system checks if his cookie is present. If it is not 
available then the server asks some secret questions (questions which are 
usually asked if user forgets password) to be answered by the user. If 
answers are correct then the server loads the smart card file as cookie 
from its backup to the client. The rest of the process of asking the user 
to enter password etc. follows as discussed above.

MY PREVIOUS MAIL FOR REFERENCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi All,

  I am currently developing an authentication project in Java which
  requires few of the user credentials to be stored on client after
  successful registration. This is to enable the client to locally
  verify the userID and do other necassary computations before it is being
sent
  to server. As of now, I am storing these in default cookies location
  at client. But if the user has disabled the  cookie option or clears
  the cookies then the authentication process cannot proceed. We are
  thinking that we can store the cookie in some other location other
  than the default location.

  In view of the above I have two queries.

  1) Is there any way to store the cookie in some different secret location
(such
     as windows system directory etc.) from where the cookie can be read at
login time.

  2) If we want to store the cookie in different location then how we
cannot identify
     the type of operating system running at client (as Linux as client
will have some
     different directory)

  I request you to kindly take some time out to give the best solution
  for the same.

Thanks &amp; Regards
Harpreet
C-DAC
