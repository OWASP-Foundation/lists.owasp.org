<PRE>Interesting concept.
 
Out of curiosity , could you expand on this? &quot;It has added automation
and smartness which has the ability to detect zero-day exploits in the
wild.&quot;
 
How would Trikaal detect something for which there is no signature
(hence being labelled as a zero day)?
 
thanks,

	Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Collaboration on a nation-wide threat
intelligenceplatform
	
	
	Greetings All,
	
	We are looking for active collaboration with various tier-1
service providers and large academic/research/corporate networks ( &gt;1000
nodes), to join hands in building a nation-wide early-warning and
actionable threat intelligence platform. Our motive is not to build some
kind of commercial service, but to provide and share real-time
intelligence for free with various contributors and partners. We believe
that this will set a good precedent in tracking security incidents and
attacks against our national infrastructure. 
	
	To get a brief overview on the project, you can visit the
following page: <A HREF="http://www.vikriya.com/products/trikaal">http://www.vikriya.com/products/trikaal</A> (Especially,
read about A-NAME). 
	
	To make Anomalous Network Activity Mining Engine (A-NAME) more
precise and actionable, we need logs - tons and tons of logs from
various kinds of networks. We will crunch it, mine it and gather some
really cool intelligence and statistics out of it, apart from other
avenues like smart honeynets etc. We will corroborate and link-together
all this information from various tracking modules, to produce real-time
data on various kinds of attack statistics, which can be browsed through
a slick Web 2.0-like portal. We assure you that we will fully adhere to
confidentiality issues and will strip payload/content of the traffic
completely, if needed. Our system can do some nice heuristics from the
packet header data itself. Such collaboration will be done under a
bulletproof NDA to avoid any confidentiality leaks. Our sensors will
have a zero-footprint on your network and all data gathering will be
done completely passively, so no interventions.
	
	I urge you mail me if you think you can contribute or can refer
us to the right people who can help. In return, you will not only get
attack and anomaly statistics from A-NAME, but also some really valuable
information and cutting-edge research on zero-days, new vulnerabilities,
botnets, phishing, malware, exploits and other security happenings from
our threat research analyst team. In short, if you contribute for one
module, we will give you returns from all the modules for free. We also
hope to make this system open to the general public later on. 
	
	Best,
	Pukhraj Singh
