Hello Puneet,
 
It has been more than 2 weeks since I filled this Participant
Satisfaction Survey. Any idea as to by when can I expect the delivery of
participant certificates?

All,
 
In regards to CPE credits. ISC2 members can claim 1 CPE / hour of
attendance to the event. The same CPE's will not be automatically added
to your certification cycle as the same practice has been stopped by
ISC2 at all its sponsored events. This facility is only available for
Surveys /events that are conducted directly by ISC2 for its members. 
 
For any other certification body such as ISACA, you may refer to CPE
guidelines for the calculation of number of CPE's you can claim towards
event attendance.
 
As per below email from Dhruv, please take out 5 minutes to fill in the
Participant Satisfaction survey. This will enable us to make our next
OWASP AppSec India 2009 more better. Once we recieve your feedback , the
certificates will be dispatched.
 
At this time i would also request you to participate actively in the
upcoming chapter meetings. The CFP is open now and we request the Appsec
Pro's to come forward and share thier knowledge in chapter meetings.
 
Should you have any further concerns, you may write to us at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-delhi">dhruv.soi at owasp.org</A> OR <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-delhi">puneet.mehta at owasp.org</A> . 
 
Thanks

The delegates who have already submitted the feedbacks, which are
necessary for us, need not re-do it again.

ntations 
We are not authorized to upload rest of the presentations without
written consent of the trainers/speakers. Incase you need those
presentations then we suggest you to kindly get in touch with the
respective speaker/trainer. We are waiting for the feedbacks from your

Thats strange I did not get any pdf link for day 1 or day 2. I would
appreciate if a pdf link can be provided for both days to all attendees.

Also given that ISC2 was a sponsor, the CPEs for ISC2 should have been
automatically added.

Hi Dhruv,
 
I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any
certificates mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in
Delhi. If not physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a
record, especially if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

Greetings OWASP Members!
After the successful launch of OWASP in India with OWASP AppSec India
Conference 2008, we would like to continue with the spirit of getting
together for common goal of fighting with the insecure code. With your
active support and participation, we intend to plan out monthly OWASP
meetings in the NCR region. Participation into these meetings will be
free of cost and is open to everyone whosoever is concerned about
application security. If you have any burning AppSec topic that you
would like to share with others or you want to demonstrate the power of
some AppSec assessment/educational tool that helped you in keeping your
application secured, then you may submit your presentation in the
attached template to Delhi Chapter Board. 
These meetings will be of short duration (3hrs) occurring on weekends
(most likely Saturday evening). Incase, your company would like to
sponsor these meetings in terms of venue and snacks accommodating 70-100
participants then kindly let us know. Your company logo will be carried
over the chapter meeting page on OWASP website as a prime sponsor. 
CFP (Call For Papers) is open for upcoming OWASP Delhi Chapter Meeting,
so submit your papers now!! Venue and timing for this particular meeting
is yet to be finalized and we hope to fix it up for mid of October 2008.

Please feel free to share your thoughts over the same to help the
community taking maximum benefits out of such meetings.
Many Thanks,
Dhruv
