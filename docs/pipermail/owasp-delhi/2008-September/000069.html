Hi Dhruv,

 

I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any certificates
mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in Delhi. If not
physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a record, especially
if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.

 

Regards,

jatin

Greetings OWASP Members!

After the successful launch of OWASP in India with OWASP AppSec India
Conference 2008, we would like to continue with the spirit of getting
together for common goal of fighting with the insecure code. With your
active support and participation, we intend to plan out monthly OWASP
meetings in the NCR region. Participation into these meetings will be free
of cost and is open to everyone whosoever is concerned about application
security. If you have any burning AppSec topic that you would like to share
with others or you want to demonstrate the power of some AppSec
assessment/educational tool that helped you in keeping your application
secured, then you may submit your presentation in the attached template to
Delhi Chapter Board. 

These meetings will be of short duration (3hrs) occurring on weekends (most
likely Saturday evening). Incase, your company would like to sponsor these
meetings in terms of venue and snacks accommodating 70-100 participants then
kindly let us know. Your company logo will be carried over the chapter
meeting page on OWASP website as a prime sponsor. 

CFP (Call For Papers) is open for upcoming OWASP Delhi Chapter Meeting, so
submit your papers now!! Venue and timing for this particular meeting is yet
to be finalized and we hope to fix it up for mid of October 2008. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts over the same to help the community
taking maximum benefits out of such meetings.

Many Thanks,

Dhruv
