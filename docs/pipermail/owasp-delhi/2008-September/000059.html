<PRE>Hi Dhruv,
 
I just wanted to check with you, if there are going to be any
certificates mailed out to people who attended the 2 day OWASP event in
Delhi. If not physical copies, atleast pdfs, as it will be useful as a
record, especially if one needs to claim CPEs with ISACA or ISC2.
 
Regards,
jatin

Greetings OWASP Members!

After the successful launch of OWASP in India with OWASP AppSec India
Conference 2008, we would like to continue with the spirit of getting
together for common goal of fighting with the insecure code. With your
active support and participation, we intend to plan out monthly OWASP
meetings in the NCR region. Participation into these meetings will be
free of cost and is open to everyone whosoever is concerned about
application security. If you have any burning AppSec topic that you
would like to share with others or you want to demonstrate the power of
some AppSec assessment/educational tool that helped you in keeping your
application secured, then you may submit your presentation in the
attached template to Delhi Chapter Board. 

These meetings will be of short duration (3hrs) occurring on weekends
(most likely Saturday evening). Incase, your company would like to
sponsor these meetings in terms of venue and snacks accommodating 70-100
participants then kindly let us know. Your company logo will be carried
over the chapter meeting page on OWASP website as a prime sponsor. 

CFP (Call For Papers) is open for upcoming OWASP Delhi Chapter Meeting,
so submit your papers now!! Venue and timing for this particular meeting
is yet to be finalized and we hope to fix it up for mid of October 2008.


Please feel free to share your thoughts over the same to help the
community taking maximum benefits out of such meetings.

Many Thanks,

Dhruv
