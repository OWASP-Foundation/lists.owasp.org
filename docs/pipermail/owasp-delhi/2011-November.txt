Dear All,

As you are aware that last year various OWASP Delhi committees were formed
with industry professionals in order to take forward the OWASP flagship and
its mission. First of all, I would like to Thank Padma, Neelu, Deepayan for
helping out last year as active committee members.

Though the committees had lot more members but there were very few active
members/leaders who could really extend their support or help. Its a
volunteer effort so we can't force anyone for contribution, however in such
scenarios opportunity to serve the committee should be transferred to
others. Its the time to revive the committees for 2012 since previous was
meant for 1 year only.

In case you wish to contribute for this cause by nominating yourself as a
committee member, please write me offline with your brief profile and how
you can help us grow.

Friends who wish to come on the committee board as a passive member, please
afford to allow other active members. Here is the document for the last
year: https://owasp.org/images/b/b3/OWASP_Delhi_Committee_Announcement.pdf

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

There are quite interesting talks out there at ClubHack. Claim OWASP discounts!!

By the way, you may also find me in live action on the talk "Exploit the exploit kits", it uncovers the underground mass hacking using client side attacks. Lately, hackers compromised US postal department using these kits. Hope to bring down the real juice! 

Below are the event details with more talks and few exciting workshops which I am sure you might not afford to miss. Hope to see you at the event!

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Hi Folks,

I am looking for the mitigation of Session fixation vulnerability on ASP
.NET platform. My development team is unable to devise the solution to
change the session id post-authentication. Please help me in this regard.

I am looking for something synonymous to PHP's session_regenerate_id() in
ASP .NET. Other solutions are greatly appreciated.

Thanks in anticipation

What sessionstate mode are they using? You mail suggests inproc?

How about abandoning the session and adding a new cookie?

Session.Abandon();
Response.Cookies.Add(....)

If it destroys the data, I think SQLServer mode could be a good option.

Though, I am not a .Net freak, but just trying to learn by commenting. Do
let me know what solution works for you.

Cheers!

Hi
Not sure if this helps, sending you two links, one which very neatly
demonstrates what is session fixation. and another one states about how to
fix it in VB or C#,
http://shiflett.org/articles/session-fixation
http://forums.asp.net/t/1360608.aspx

also see this if it helps.

Vaibhav,

In java, we can do in following way:

session.invalidate();
session=request.getSession(true);

Above code will destroy the previous session and regenerate a new session
id. Same 'concept' could be used in .Net. I am not sure with the code
though. You may want to view the following link by MSDN as well:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178582.aspx

Let me know if it works! :-)
