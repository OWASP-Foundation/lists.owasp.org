Hi List,

 

I figured I'd try sharing a new paper I completed and posted to my site

yesterday.

 

The paper is based off some of the work I've been discussing at various

conferences recently in relation to the man-in-the-browser attack vectors,

and their effect on financial Web applications - in particular, consumer

online banking.

 

Titled &quot;Continuing Business with Malware Infected Customers&quot; looks at the

threat from the perspective of &quot;with so many infected computers out there,

and the number not likely to go down, what sort of things can you build in

to your Web application to make it more resilient to man-in-the-browser

attack vectors?&quot;. As I'm sure most of the list already knows, the

man-in-the-browser vector is particularly insidious and defeats just about

all the current protection technologies out there - largely because it's

such a convenient vector for social engineering. Anyhow, this paper is

designed to help Web developers take a closer look at their transactional

Web applications and provide various levels of best practice advice on

helping to mitigate the threat. In addition, I'm aiming to raise business

awareness of the fact that they will increasingly just have to assume that a

sizable percentage of their customer base is probably infected - and develop

protection strategies accordingly.

 

The paper can be found at::

Cheers,

 

Gunter

 

 

The intro/abstract for the paper...

 

Continuing Business with Malware Infected Customers - Best Practices and the

Security Ergonomics of Web Application Design for Compromised Customer Hosts

 

Today's media is full of statistics and stories detailing how the Internet

has become an increasingly dangerous place for all concerned. Figures of

tens of millions and hundreds of millions of bot-infected computers are

regularly discussed, along with approximations that between one-quarter and

one-third of all home computer systems are already infected with some form

of malware. With a conservative estimate of 1.4 billion computers browsing

the Internet on a daily basis (mid-2008 figures), that could equate to

upwards of 420 million computers that can't be trusted - and the numbers

could be higher as criminals increasingly target Web browser technologies

with malicious Web content - infecting hundreds of millions more along the

way.

Despite these kinds of warnings and their backing statistics, online

businesses have yet to fully grasp the significance of the threat. Most of

the advice about dealing with the problem has focused on attempting to

correct the client-side infection and yet, despite the education campaigns

and ubiquity of desktop anti-virus solutions, the number of infected

computers has continued to rise. The problem facing online businesses going

forward is, if upwards of one-third of their customers are likely to be

using computers infected with malware to conduct business transactions with

them, how should they continue to do business with an infected customer

base?

This paper discusses many of the best practices businesses can adopt for

their Web application design and back-office support processes in order to

minimize this growing threat, along with helping to reduce several of the

risks posed with continuing to do business customers likely to be operating

infected computers.
