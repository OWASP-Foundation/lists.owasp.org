<PRE>Hi dhruv,
rightly said.

they have already started advertising it on the 2nd day of the attack.
the terrorists are killing there in mumbai, and our superb politicians are
asking for votes in paper.
it is a bit shocking when i saw it in the paper.

and more shocking is that some of my friends are quite impressed with the ad
and openly supporting it.

we can never come close to us/uk/israel in terms of security, as we are
masters at building internals walls of religions/castes/regions
and always ready to hit the other with the left over bricks. the bricks just
started evolving into bombs.

i hope we will not end up like pakisthan/iraq throwing bombs at each other
and feeling proud of the crime committed.

&gt;<i>  I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
</I>&gt;<i> here with believe that you guys won't mind it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indian politicians are taking the civilians for granted and are very much
</I>&gt;<i> centric at their personal interests rather caring about interest of the
</I>&gt;<i> country. They are good at making unrealistic statements in media but no
</I>&gt;<i> action at all. I was in Delhi at the time of this attack on nation, but this
</I>&gt;<i> particular incident has really disturbed my deep feelings for my nation and
</I>&gt;<i> is giving so disheartening feeling of being an impotent and coward Indian
</I>&gt;<i> who can be killed anytime on the roads or in the suite of a 7 star hotel. No
</I>&gt;<i> one can enter and open up fire just like that in my home! I am 10000% sure,
</I>&gt;<i> the current heat will go on for few more days in Media and politicians will
</I>&gt;<i> be under pressure. But when it will come to action, it will be all hollow.
</I>&gt;<i> Honorable prime minister has blamed Pakistan for this, which is so lame and
</I>&gt;<i> highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can come from any part of the
</I>&gt;<i> world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are just terrorists. Who
</I>&gt;<i> cares, if they were trained in Pakistan or in America? Point is, are we
</I>&gt;<i> fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border security and then
</I>&gt;<i> internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off their hands
</I>&gt;<i> by blaming any other country and must understand that &quot;We are weak from
</I>&gt;<i> inside-out&quot;. Look at United States, one attack and they just declared
</I>&gt;<i> openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy it! But wow!
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome to India! We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation for
</I>&gt;<i> OBCs, Marathas rule Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don't care
</I>&gt;<i> about the life of those OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in our
</I>&gt;<i> country. I won't be surprised to see another attack in next few months in
</I>&gt;<i> Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it. It can just happen to anyone,
</I>&gt;<i> except politicians! And they know it very well that they are always going to
</I>&gt;<i> be safe due to high personal security. I don't see any GOD for these people
</I>&gt;<i> who just don't perform their duties for which they were elected by the
</I>&gt;<i> civilians.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for
</I>&gt;<i> terrorists, coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a
</I>&gt;<i> miserable life. There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people.
</I>&gt;<i> Cut down their sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them
</I>&gt;<i> live a miserable life in their own country. I am so angry on the way
</I>&gt;<i> politicians of my country operate and couldn't really sleep from last 3 days
</I>&gt;<i> or concentrate on my work. May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to
</I>&gt;<i> take birth in the country that is always operated by incompetent and
</I>&gt;<i> impotent politicians! Probably, our politicians were never fed with their
</I>&gt;<i> mother's breast milk and must have been fed by some bitches on the street!
</I>&gt;<i> That is why they have no love for their nation!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
</I>&gt;<i> single solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
</I>&gt;<i> politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can
</I>&gt;<i> bring a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will,
</I>&gt;<i> but I feel they might) act on terrorism then...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dhruv
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -------
</I>&gt;<i> If you meet any Indian politician, ask him to kill me. I don't want a death
</I>&gt;<i> from some terrorist in my own country!!!
