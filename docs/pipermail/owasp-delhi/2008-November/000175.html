<PRE>Whatever, but then who cares if the security professionals hadn't healthy
breakfast or had a fight with spouse to miss the XSS while testing the
application.Found a bug, report it to the company and then, none of my
business to confirm the bug or understand their quarterly or annual pen-test
programs. If they need assistance to understand and fix the bug then no free
lunches!

I am sure, they have people hired to ensure security of thier critical
application. The question is are these so called security professionals
competent to perform the job that they are hired for...???? Or is it a
quarterly automated pen test performed last time that apparently missed to
catch the jewel crown &quot;XSS&quot;..:-)

Be generic, call it a bug and report the issue without being worried about
software bug or XSS. If they offer some remuneration then no harm in going
ahead to confirm this one or may be finding more juicy stuff. I would prefer
to confirm vulnerabilities for our clients or some software products rather
offering free consulting services to irresponsible companies those deploy
insecure software and make their customers suffer...If you find any
vulnerability on the wild, no doubt report it in ethical way! But no reason
to spend time over it, where you don't have any personal or professional
interest!

Thanks for pointing out Plash.

It *seems* to be an exploitation.  I didnt have enough time to analyze it,
so I was hoping that someone from owasp delhi would confirm whether it is
an exploitation or not. &quot;Print this page&quot; link didnt work - it just showed
an alert box.  I would prefer to be reasonably sure that it is not a
programming issue.

What do other guys in the mailing list say? Report it right away or confirm
the issue and report it?

IRCTC seems to have been exploited by an XSS vuln. After booking the
ticket, when you click on the print this page link, an alert (&quot;hi&quot;)
appears. This is the status today morning. I didnt hav etime to analyze as
I had to rush to office. Will see if I can spend some time from office.

Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit seemed
too trivial for my attention.

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the
line: &quot;launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.&quot;) and the subsequent malware it was
trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they got
something juicy.

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike say
buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term created
by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. This one
would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on fancy
definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of nested
iframes.

Best,
Pukhraj

Hi Pukhraj,

Thanks for your explanation. As I understand that a shotgun attack is
the one where the attacking malware site attempts to exploit multiple
vulnerabilities ranging from javascript to shockwave objects ?
The url you referred lists out the type of malicious SQL injection
request that will compromise an MS-SQL server( or can it compromise
other any other database servers ) by updating the open table_cursors,
thereby injecting javascript into resultsets which are being fetched
by the web-pages which thus get written out into the webpages being
served and execute a shotgun attack on endusers computers. Is my
understanding correct.

Thanks
