<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
</I>&gt;<i> here with believe that you guys won't mind it!
</I>Think 'holistic' approach to overall security which includes physical
world security, its not off-topic but relevant to this list. Your
information security professional caught in terrorist attack could
make your application in-secure. Its for a reason that datacenters are
supposed to have 3 meter steel reinforced concrete walls designed to
withstand nuclear attacks.

&lt;SNIP-OUTBURST&gt;
&gt;<i> Point is, are we fully secured???
</I>Don't we know 'full security' is a mirage. Let us work in the spirit
of information security by discussing how the security circus is not
really making us secure.


Right from our education system our citizens learn one thing that
every system can be gamed given sufficient motivation. And that is
what we do in our lifetimes here in India. Game the system to prevent
it from getting you caught in it. The law abiding citizens can either
avoid dealing with the system or crack it to take additional
advantages over others. We even celebrate corporates that can subvert
the system better. Is this in-solvent system capable of protecting us.
Full-Disclosure and non-sensational discussion about the ills of
system and its communication in a feedback loop to the aspiring to be
elected representatives is a way we should go about it.

Examples :-
1. KYC norms for Telecom and Financial products: A chain is only as
strong as its weakest link. Can a terrorist not forge/obtain a genuine
passport and proof of address( lease agreement ). Even for a PAN
number the verification system provided to the Banks/financial
institutions only verifies whether a PAN is valid or not. The last
mile guy who looks at the photograph of yours on PAN card/any photo id
card has no way of knowing that the photo belongs to you. The web
applications for Tax Information Network are disjointed and prone to
variety of social engineering attacks. A simpler environment friendly
system based on digital certificates can be implemented as opposed to
making millions of people run around government departments in their
gas guzzling cars.


2. Airport security:
a) Why the X-Ray machines are deep into crowded areas. X-Ray machines
and security checks should be at the entrance of the airport itself.
Suppose someone just carries luggage full of explosives and explodes
it right at the X-Ray machine.

b) I am also reminded of the lackadaisical attitude at security staff
a few months back. When I complained about someone leaving his luggage
un-attended the guard told me the owner must have been gone to the
restroom and I needn't worry so much. Ofcourse it turned out to be
true the guy who left his luggage un-attended was back.
3. Is there something called an escalation matrix in place that the
whole security establishment is aware of. It is said that the people
responsible for making the request for the crack force took an
in-ordinate amount of time. It was the same during the Kandhar hijack.
The hijacked plane could have been detained at Amritsar Airport when
it stopped for re-fuelling. It doesn't matter which party's government
is in power. Our government establishment is composed of same
bureaucrats who only work in CYA mode and know only how to pass the
buck. A phone call to any phone number listed on NIC maintained
government sites for their departments would provide you with another
phone number and another in the worst show of buck passing until you
find someone amongst those 1% conscientious bureaucrats who are
actually running the whole show.

Lets document possible scenarios and use cases in true application
security style with full-disclosure of exploit codes for cracking the
system. Lets make the system not rest until it gets better at fixing
itself and absorbing more nuanced feedback produced by information
security forums like ours rather than periodical outbursts like our
maniacal mass media.

&gt;<i> Country needs to think about its border security and then
</I>&gt;<i> internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off their hands
</I>&gt;<i> by blaming any other country and must understand that &quot;We are weak from
</I>&gt;<i> inside-out&quot;. Look at United States,
</I>
The difference is a culture of security. In India that there is no
culture of secure thinking. Construction workers working without hard
hats, people in smaller towns not putting on seat belts while driving
in cars are all examples of an in-disciplined and un-educated
citizenry and reflect on enforcement agencies with a lack of will to
enforce the rules. This is further accentuated by well meaning but
counter-productive actions of politicians like our venerable Health
minister who want to load the law enforcement agencies with laws that
cannot be enforced without turning the country into a police state.
&lt;SNIP-more-rants&gt;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
</I>&gt;<i> single solution to terrorism in India:
</I>It is not the Indian politics but lack of interest and holier than
thou attitude of our educated classes. We cry hoarse when we hear
about cases/FIRs against our electoral candidates. Even while we know
that if one of us were to contest the elections then false FIRs would
be lodged against by opposing candidates stooges. Why do we hold our
politicians to different standards.
&gt;<i> Terrorists should start targeting our
</I>&gt;<i> politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....
</I>Let us not wish for things we do not really wish to come true. Are you
saying that we would be happy that Rajiv Gandhi died at the hands of
terrorists.
&gt;<i> That can
</I>&gt;<i> bring a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will,
</I>&gt;<i> but I feel they might) act on terrorism then...
</I>The politician's biggest fault is not in-action but subverting the
system that is supposed to fight against the terrorists. The impotence
of Maharashtra's ruling coalition in preventing crimes against indian
citizens by language based separatists couldn't have been lost on the
terrorist thinktanks. Projecting an image of state power ( US style )
and rule of law ( see Broken Window Theory
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_Broken_Windows">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_Broken_Windows</A> ) goes a long way
in dissuading potential local helpers in terror crimes.
