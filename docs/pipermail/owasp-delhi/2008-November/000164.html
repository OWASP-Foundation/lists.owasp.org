<PRE>Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit seemed
too trivial for my attention.

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the
line: &quot;launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.&quot;) and the subsequent malware it was
trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they got
something juicy.

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike say
buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term created
by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. This one
would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on fancy
definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of nested
iframes.

Best,
Pukhraj

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; See advisory here

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://www.ndtv.com/conve">http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://www.ndtv.com/conve</A>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I couldn't see the malware sites mentioned on the advisory serving out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from ndtv.com anymore on my firebug console so I figure that these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vulnerabilities might have been gone from their site now. Does someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has more information as to what happened here, was it their windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; servers that got compromised or XSS issues from the advertising or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user generated content served by them.
