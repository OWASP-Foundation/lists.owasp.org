<PRE>This is the second time I have heard of NDTV being compromised. The first
time it was compromised with the MPack exploitation toolkit. 

The infection via d0uhunqn-dot-cn is pretty old. It seems that website
remained compromised for a long time. Sad! It's a typical shotgun attack,
although the malicious links seem to be offline now. Couple of projects have
crawled through those malicious websites which have been mentioned in the
Google diagnostics page (CastleCops, Shadowserver, Symantec SafeWeb, et al).
Some of the exploits being served are old (from the Storm Worm days):

See advisory here
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://www.ndtv.com/conve">http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://www.ndtv.com/conve</A>
rgence/ndtv/videos.aspx&amp;hl=en

I couldn't see the malware sites mentioned on the advisory serving out
from ndtv.com anymore on my firebug console so I figure that these
vulnerabilities might have been gone from their site now. Does someone
has more information as to what happened here, was it their windows
servers that got compromised or XSS issues from the advertising or
user generated content served by them.

Cheers!!
