<PRE>I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
here with believe that you guys won't mind it!

 

Indian politicians are taking the civilians for granted and are very much
centric at their personal interests rather caring about interest of the
country. They are good at making unrealistic statements in media but no
action at all. I was in Delhi at the time of this attack on nation, but this
particular incident has really disturbed my deep feelings for my nation and
is giving so disheartening feeling of being an impotent and coward Indian
who can be killed anytime on the roads or in the suite of a 7 star hotel. No
one can enter and open up fire just like that in my home! I am 10000% sure,
the current heat will go on for few more days in Media and politicians will
be under pressure. But when it will come to action, it will be all hollow.
Honorable prime minister has blamed Pakistan for this, which is so lame and
highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can come from any part of the
world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are just terrorists. Who
cares, if they were trained in Pakistan or in America? Point is, are we
fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border security and then
internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong
intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off their hands
by blaming any other country and must understand that &quot;We are weak from
inside-out&quot;. Look at United States, one attack and they just declared
openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy it! But wow!
Welcome to India! We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation for
OBCs, Marathas rule Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don't care
about the life of those OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in our
country. I won't be surprised to see another attack in next few months in
Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it. It can just happen to anyone,
except politicians! And they know it very well that they are always going to
be safe due to high personal security. I don't see any GOD for these people
who just don't perform their duties for which they were elected by the
civilians. 

Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for terrorists,
coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a miserable
life. There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people. Cut down
their sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them live a
miserable life in their own country. I am so angry on the way politicians of
my country operate and couldn't really sleep from last 3 days or concentrate
on my work. May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to take birth in the
country that is always operated by incompetent and impotent politicians!
Probably, our politicians were never fed with their mother's breast milk and
must have been fed by some bitches on the street! That is why they have no
love for their nation! 

Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
single solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can
bring a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will,
but I feel they might) act on terrorism then... 



 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

If you meet any Indian politician, ask him to kill me. I don't want a death
from some terrorist in my own country!!!
