&gt;&gt;<i>Think 'holistic' approach to overall security which includes physical
</I>world security, 
Probably, the impact of this attack could have been reduced if our officials
would have kept an eagle eye on the CCTV capturing. No use to run those
captured footages after 189 people have lost their lives. Again negligence!
Organizational security can't be accomplished till the time, CEO of the
organization is not worried about it and same goes for the country...

&gt;&gt;<i>Lets document possible scenarios and use cases in true application
</I>security style with full-disclosure of exploit codes for cracking the
system. 
You hit the nail right up on the head. I also had same stuff running in my
mind. Let me try to form a wiki for this but I am scared my friend that most
of the information might get used by the terrorists and no action will come
from our great national leaders. I was even thinking to shoot some videos to
show how easy it is to carry explosives from one part to another by carrying
some bag filled with rocks and stones and no security official is going to
check it.

&gt;&gt;<i>Are you saying that we would be happy that Rajiv Gandhi died at the hands
</I>of
terrorists.
Give me a single name that can be compared even as 10% to Rajiv Gandhi or
Indira Gandhi..I think their unfortunate assassination has made our
politicians cowards and they are scared of fighting with terrorism. Look at
Hemant Karkare, at 1AM he never thought of playing family-family. OR, giving
directions to his subordinates from his office room. He just came right on
the battle ground to show his leadership to his subordinates and motivate
them. phew! As usual we were unfortunate to loose yet another national hero.
But holly cow, his sacrifice to nation was tried to be compensated by Mr.
Modi for few bucks, who accused him sometime back. I am proud of Hemant's
wife who denied accepting that compensation. We need to accept that our
country's leadership from the top is badly struggling, their blood is too
cold, they are over aged and if they will try to get aggressive on fighting
with terrorism either they will get high blood pressure problem or will die
from heart attack. 

&gt;&gt;<i>The impotence of Maharashtra's ruling coalition in preventing crimes
</I>against indian
Citizens
Referring to our core exposure to information security. If you are
vulnerable, you will be exploited. We need to fight with vulnerabilities
rather fighting with various variants of exploits. I feel India is fighting
with terrorists and not with the terrorism. At this time they exploited the
vulnerability of Porbandar (Gujrat) and low security at different places, we
never made vulnerability assessment of our boarder and other places but were
ready with NSG, Army, Cops, ATS to fight with exploiters. Reactive Vs
Proactive!!! Cost of security assessment is much lower than fixing the
impact! We could learn from this example, be it information security or
national security. I just think if there would have 100-200 terrorists
spreaded over different prominent parts of the country what difference it
would have been made and how many lives our heroes and country would have
sacrificed! It happens only in India, my incredible India...
