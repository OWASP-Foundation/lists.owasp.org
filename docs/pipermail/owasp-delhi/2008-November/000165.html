<PRE>IRCTC seems to have been exploited by an XSS vuln. After booking the 
ticket, when you click on the print this page link, an alert (&quot;hi&quot;) 
appears. This is the status today morning. I didnt hav etime to analyze as 
I had to rush to office. Will see if I can spend some time from office.

Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit 
seemed too trivial for my attention. 

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the 
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the 
line: &quot;launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very 
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.&quot;) and the subsequent malware it 
was trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they 
got something juicy. 

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike 
say buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term 
created by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. 
This one would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on 
fancy definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of 
nested iframes. 

Best,
Pukhraj

Hi Pukhraj,

Thanks for your explanation. As I understand that a shotgun attack is
the one where the attacking malware site attempts to exploit multiple
vulnerabilities ranging from javascript to shockwave objects ?
The url you referred lists out the type of malicious SQL injection
request that will compromise an MS-SQL server( or can it compromise
other any other database servers ) by updating the open table_cursors,
thereby injecting javascript into resultsets which are being fetched
by the web-pages which thus get written out into the webpages being
served and execute a shotgun attack on endusers computers. Is my
understanding correct.

Thanks
