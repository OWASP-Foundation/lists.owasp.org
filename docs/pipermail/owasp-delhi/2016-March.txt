*PROJECTS: SAMM Summit in NYC, Plus More Project News and Releases*

*SAMM Summit in NYC, April 20-21*

We are excited to announce our second SAMM Summit on April 20-21 in New
York!

The SAMM Summit is not a regular conference with speaking slots, but a
summit "in OWASP Style (!)". We will work together in a 2-day sprint on
SAMMv2.

If you are interested to contribute, you are most welcome!

   1. Either you bring in your knowledge of SAMM or other secure
   development methodology experience.
   2. Or as OWASP Project leader/contributor you research how we can better
   integrate SAMM with your project (and the other way around).

This is an excellent opportunity to influence the direction of SAMM and
exchange experiences with your peers!

Testimonial from 2015:
"The SAMM summit provided an opportunity to breathe new life into a
framework that I use to facilitate my day-to-day work and support my
customers." Bruce C Jenkins, Fortify Security Lead, Hewlett-Packard Company

In the next weeks/months before the Summit we will create the SAMMv2
Product Backlog as basis towards the on-site Summit 2-day sprint (keep an
eye on our mailing list - https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/samm)

*CHAPTERS: New Chapters, Leader Transitions, Meeting Ideas for 2016*

*Notable Chapter Activity*

On the heels of the recent Bsides event in Lagos, Nigeria, our OWASP
Nigeria chapter held its first local chapter meeting in Lagos on February
13. The team posted some pictures on the OWASP Lagos Facebook page:
on.fb.me/1TsBofq
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/9e7b0db171/174264e7b2/1a7abbd71b>

OWASP Nigeria plans to hold another event in Lagos this April with a goal
toward inviting more external speakers, growing participation via social
media and finding additional ways to contribute to application security
awareness outside Nigeria. Keep an eye on this chapter!

OWASP Kerala has been conducting regular awareness talks for students and
public. Enjoy some pictures from the past 4 events we organized in the past
month at:

   - Institution of Engineers, Kerala State Centre
   - Trivandrum Tamil Sangham
   - Sarabhai Institute of Science and Technology
   - TKM College of Engineering

The audience varied from students ( in the engineering Colleges ) to senior
and retired engineers ( at Institution of Engineers ) to general public (
at Trivandrum Tamil Sangham ). We are happy to see that people are
receptive to security awareness and there's great response from their side
and repeated requests.

Hi All,

Would you be able to communicate with your local chapters/ anyone that may
be interested, that today is the last day of the early bird tickets to
AppSec EU.

I've tweeted about this on the @appseceu twitter account, if you could also
share it around that would be great.

Thanks
