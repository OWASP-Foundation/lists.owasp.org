Vishal,

Thank you for your interest in re-opening the Delhi OWASP Chapter. As this
chapter isn't currently marked as closed, I've cc'd the current leader for
clarification of their intent.

Greetings OWASPer's,

The OWASP Foundation recently received a request to restart the Delhi
Chapter. As the individual who is the current leader no longer seems to
maintain their owasp.org email address (I received a bad address message,
when trying to email them) posting to the list is the next step.

If you feel there is one among you who would be better suited to step-up
and run this chapter, please say so. The Foundation will give this list 14
days to respond, before we reassign the chapter to a new leader. We have
cc'd him on this email, so that you may posit questions and discuss this
situation with him, if there in anything you feel he should know.

Thank you for your timely attention to this matter.



Regards,

Nitin,

Due to the apparent stagnant nature of this chapter, in order to clarify
your position as an active chapter, please answer the following questions:

   - Can you explain the lapse in chapter activity?
   - The lack of updates to the Wiki (last was in 2010, with the exception
   of a posting regarding InfoSec India 2013),
   - The lack of mailing list activity and items from January still needing
   to be approved, indicating a lack of moderation on the list?
   - Where and when are your meetings held and how often?
   - What site, if not the Wiki, are you using for Chapter information
   updates?

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.


Best,

Hi,

As per my research Imperva is good option and has many plus compared to
other WAFs. Though I have never worked on any WAF.

Hi Anuvrat,
You could check out mod_security as well. Its available for apache, iis and
nginx.

Its open source, with an active community so you'd get good support there.

Dear Fellow OWASPers,

Its time to bring the Delhi chapter out of long period of dormancy!
Here is what has been done/planned till date:

1) The mailing list will be moderated actively. Priyanka Tomar posted a
query earlier today and we felt that her timing was perfect! Why so?
    >> This mail not only serves as introductory mail from our end but also
as a detailed response to her query.

2) A new Wiki page has been setup and will have regular updates -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Delhi_NCR

3) Chapter meets will become a norm instead of an exception. The revival
meet is being planned for July 2014.

But, all of this effort will not sustain unless there is active
contribution from the community. Its for the community after all! Help
could be in the form of assisting with organizing the chapter meet,
stepping up to conduct a session on some topic, finding venues, good
technical discussions on the mailing list etc. Matter-of-fact, if there's
an existing/new OWASP project a bunch of us could contribute to, bring it
up.

Whether you're simply interested in AppSec/seasoned pro. interested in
giving back to the community/interested in networking, join the bandwagon!
Fun and learning along the way is assured. :-)

Feel free to reach out to us in case you wish to talk or discuss something

Hi,
I'm working on OWASP CSRF Protector project as GSOC student currently. You
can learn more about this project at:
http://cistoner.org/blog/minhaz/2014/06/17/csrfprotector-project/

Github repo:
1. CSRF Protector php library
<https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP>
2. mod_csrfprotector apache 2.x.x module
<http://github.com/mebjas/mod_csrfprotector>

I have been working on this for last one month, I think it would be great
to have your feedbacks and contribution on this.


Minhaz,

Hi Folks,

Thank you all for showing support (on & off the list) in fueling this
initiative. Let's discuss the chapter revival action items in our upcoming
meet which is tentatively planned for *26 July, 2014 (Saturday)*.

Feel free to drop an email to this list or reach out to any of the chapter
leaders to discuss anything regarding our chapter.

@Minhaz, Great project! I am initiating a separate thread for your project
discussion.

Thanks,
Vaibhav

Hi All,

Minhaz from our Delhi chapter is working on OWASP CSRF Protector project.
Please look around this project and guide him with your valuable feedback.

@Minhaz, do check the OWASP ESAPI project as it seems related to your
CSRFProtector
PHP library. (The PHP version of ESAPI seems to be a inactive project,
though!)

Thanks,
Vaibhav

Dear Priyanka,

Needless to say, your session is confirmed. Thanks for stepping up! :-)

Fellow OWASPers,

Just like Priyanka has raised her hand to conduct a short session at the
upcoming meet on July 26th (Saturday), would be great if someone else would
like to conduct a more detailed 1 - 1.5 hour session! Any AppSec topic is
fine. This would translate to a total of 2 technical sessions during the
meet, one short and one long.

If interested, please revert with the topic you plan on covering and a
rough outline of the talk.

Vishal
