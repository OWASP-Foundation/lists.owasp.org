Hi,

I have a query.

*Case :*
The user is able to Upload following files which has names like:

filename%00.pdf         --- null byte
filename..pdf               -- double dot


*Query:*Is this a vulnerability if user is able to upload these files.


*Case:*
User is able to edit the file in notepad and added
<script>alert(123)</script> in the file content.

*Query:*
Is this a vulnerability if javascript is not getting executed as its a PDF
file ??

Please reply.

> CFP se7en
> ==============
>
> Tips
> ====
> 1. Submit early - Submitting early increases the chance of acceptance
> in the first round itself. The more you delay the more competition you
> have with other papers that are submitted later.
> 2. Technical description - The more concrete technical details you
> provide the better chance you have of getting accepted. Reviewers
> usually give low score to submissions that have very small or vague
> abstract and may not request for more details. The best way is to
> provide a supporting full technical paper that explains all the
> vulnerabilities, exploits etc in detail.
> 3. Declining a paper - Please take rejection as a suggestion for
> improvement somewhere in the paper and not as an offense. Declining a
> paper does not mean your submission is not good. There are many
> parameters we look at when reviewing a paper, technical depth is only
> one of them. Many times we have to let go of really good talks because
> there is already an accepted paper on similar subject or too many good
> submissions. We want you to succeed and are only trying to help you in
> preparing you for future submissions. So, cheer up and get ready for
> the next submission.
> 4. Review comments - We do not ask our review board for comments. If
> they have any comments, they write it down which we usually pass to
> the submitters. So, if we have comments we will pass it on. You don't
> have to specifically ask for review comments. Also, for small and
> vague abstracts, or talks delivered previously we do not share any
> review comments.
>
> Submission Type
> ==================
> Submit under any of the below Type
>  - Talk (40 mins - 1 hr)
>  - Event (Sub-events, Competitions, CTFs, BOFs)
>  - Recreation (Fun events, Games, Parties, Tech Rock bands, Djs etc)
>  - Tutorial (2-3hrs Workshops, hacking villages)
>
> Submission Topics
> ======================
> Anything that aligns with our motto - "The neXt security thing!" is
> welcome.
> And as a special consideration for nullcon se7en any digital sin is
> also welcome ;)
>
> Categories
> =============
> The talk time duration includes time for questions and answers (5-10
> minutes)
>
> New Research Category (40 mins - 1 hr)
>  - It is a deep knowledge technical track that includes new research,
> vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
>
> Desi Jugaad (30 mins - 1 hr)
>  - It is our signature new research category talk and includes any
> local hacks. This category is dedicated to hackers who find innovative
> tech/non-tech solutions for real-life challenges.
>
> Current Research Category (30 mins - 1 hr)
>  - It comprises of known security issues, case studies, twist to an
> existing research, tool, vulnerability, exploit or
> research-in-progress. Although this track is very technical, it covers
> known techniques, analysis and research already published or presented
> even though there might be some additions to it. Please note if you
> have already published, presented your research, it will fall in this
> category even though you have added new stuff to your research.
>
> Tool Category (30 mins - 1 hr)
>  - It comprises of open source security tools, exploits, frameworks
> etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the original authors to
> showcase their software to the world.
>
> Event/Recreation Category (No specific time limit)
>   - This is for proposing any exciting sub-events as mentioned above
> in "Submission Type"
>
> Review
> ==========
> We have an external review panel that scores the papers and based on
> the scoring we take a call on acceptance of papers.
>
> Submission Format
> ===================
> Email the paper to: cfp at nullcon.net
> The subject should be: CFP Goa 2016 < Paper Title >
> Email Body:

> Submission Title
> Country (and City) of residence
> Organization and Designation
> Contact Number
> Have you presented or submitted this paper at any other conference(s)
> or magazine(s)?
> Yes, No. If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the
> previous ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or
> are due to be given elsewhere prior to nullcon will be considered as
> current research category talks unless they consist of cutting edge

> Paper Abstract
>  - Please provide detailed working or your research/work. The more
> details you provide the better it is for the reviewers. Please keep
> the abstract to the point. Please do not try to hide the technical
> details or say "I can't disclose it till bla bla" as it does not help
> the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a low score because
> of insufficient information available in the abstract.
>
> Supporting technical details (Please attach full technical paper for
> review)
>   - This is not a must if your abstract is technical and large enough
> for reviewers to understand your research fully. However, providing a
> full technical paper increases the chances of acceptance as reviewers
> get a better understanding of the technical capability.
>
> Your high resolution photo (attached)
>
> Note
> ========
> Only the original authors should submit their research and any
> submission from a third party will be rejected. The Abstract should
> clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail and merely
> mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the research
> to its full extent. nullcon is an open knowledge/research sharing
> platform and hence product/company marketing and pitches will be
> rejected. We request you not to submit any product specific talk.

Hi Reuben,
You need to have a jailbreak device in order to do thorough analysis of the
app which includes static and dynamic analysis. I have been doin mobile pen
testing for more than a year now and it will not be complete without a
jailbreak device.

You need to have Mac, device, internet,


Cheers!
