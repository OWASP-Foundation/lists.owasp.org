is out
To: OWASP Leaders <owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>


The Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID) annual report for 2007 is out.

The WHID 2007 annual report builds on the new metrics we recently added to
WHID, such as attack method, attack outcome, country and industry sector of
hacked organization to analyze web hacking trends in 2007.

In the report we discuss the drivers for web hacking, the vulnerabilities
exploited and the types of organization attacked. We hope that the report
can serve to highlight the web application security issue and as a base for
risk analysis for web applications.

The report was prepared by The Web Application Security Consortium (WASC)
together with Breach Security Labs, the research arm of Breach Security,
which sponsors the project.

The report is available at:
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/statistics.shtml

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Web Hacking Incidents Database Update for Feb 20th
Message-ID: <47bc1cd8.22ba720a.3d20.ffffb2c2@mx.google.com>


The latest bunch of events added to the Web Hacking Incidents Database
include many international incidents. Enjoy. And if you still haven't had a
chance to read our 2007 annual report, it is quite fascinating. you can find
it at http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/statistics.shtml.

* In Korea, a Chinese hacker stole 18 Million(!) customers' records from an
auction site: http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-10.shtml. 

* In Greece and Ecuador government web sites where defaced
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-12.shtml,
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-11.shtml). 

* In the US a small financial firm in Montana lost the information of all
its 226,000 customers
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2008-08.shtml)

But the incident I want to focus on this week is one I just added from late
last year: In India a large newspaper site was broken into and malware was
planted on it
(http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2007-85.shtml). Why is it
important? based on a recent report by WebSense, 51% of the sites hosing
malware are legitimate sites that have been broken into. This is a major
shift in web based threats. For end users, it is not sufficient anymore to
keep to web sites they trust. For site owners it means that protecting their
sensitive applications is no longer sufficient. Hackers have a financial
incentive to attack any popular page. The direct damage of such an attack,
even though invisible, is less visitors as more and more browser add-ons
block access to sites hosting malware. The indirect damage is of course a
branding and marketing damage.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Stolen FTP Credentials Offered for Sale: Major Firms
	at Risk
Message-ID: <e83f42880802291122l7b9086cwbf26b55e8c03d6fa@mail.gmail.com>

The so-called meoryprof.info (Me-or-you-Profit) site is selling username,
password, and server addresses of these FTP servers as well as the NeoSploit
Version 2 crimeware package, which basically lets the bad guys who buy it
instantly infect these sites with malicious code -- with the goal of
stealing valuable and confidential data from them as well as any visitors to
the sites. It also "qualifies" the stolen accounts so that buyers either can
then set a price to resell the compromised FTP credentials to other
cybercriminals, or determine which are the more potentially lucrative sites
to hack.
