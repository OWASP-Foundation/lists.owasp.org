Hello Dhruv,

The WASC 26 is an alias for the Threat Classification v1 which can be found
at
http://projects.webappsec.org/Threat-Classification-Previous-Versions

The latest version of the Threat Classification (v2.0) can be found at
http://projects.webappsec.org/Threat-Classification
and
http://projects.webappsec.org/f/WASC-TC-v2_0.pdf
and
http://projects.webappsec.org/Threat-Classification-Reference-Grid

Let me know if you have any questions.

Computer scientists led by Hovav Shacham, a UC San Diego professor, hacked
an electronic voting machine and stole votes using a malicious programming
approach that had not been invented when the voting machine was designed.
The computer scientists employed "return-oriented programming" to force a
Sequoia AVC Advantage electronic voting machine to turn against itself and
steal votes

**On March 29, 2010, Pune Mirror carried a report on how Electronic Voting
Machines (EVMs) are easy to hack into....

Apologies for being late to share the below response from WASC.

Purohit, there is also email ID of Jeremiah for you to contact in the trail

The TC at this stage is merely a series of definitions for attacks and
weaknesses and is not meant to
be a testing guide. Doesn't OWASP have content outlining how to test for
issues?

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] PCI DSS and IT Security
Message-ID: <AANLkTikkCIUsv8bimo830MM6ZWuJHeS9sMpzZxqEjz3q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

This is with reference to PCI DSS. Is the PCI DSS policy only restricted to
applications, systems and environments where debit card or credit cards are
used for transactions ?  How about transactions involving internet banking
for retail users and corporate banking for corporates where no credit card
or debit card details are used. Also how PCI DSS policy is technically
implemented. Financial and banking organizations dont implement the PCI DSS
policy in the first step. There is lot of opposition, red-tapism to change.
The Application penetration testing is executed in one phase, the network
pen-test is done at a later stage, the web server V.A , database audit is
done randomly. So how the PCI DSS policy is executed and integrated. Please
clarify.

With regards,
Purohit Singh

^^NOT TRUE, transaction and storage always come in to scope, and PCI DSS is
applicable.

My understanding is.. even if you do not store the data but are an
outsourced provider and have access to the data store at the PCI entity
(bank / acquirer etc) be prepared to be asked to become PCI compliant. Any
organization which is under PCI purview will ensure that their vendors / out
source service providers are compliant.
So, i shall concur with Vaibhav's statement.

You will be surprised to see how far "downstream' the PCI complaint company
will go in order to ensure that their own house is in order. The logic is
simple - if your client asks u to ensure compliance it is no sweat off their
back since you have to spend  your own money. And they are able to ensure
that all roads leading into and out of their organization are reasonably
secured.
