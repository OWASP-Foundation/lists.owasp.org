Besides what you have been told, you can use hex editors to open the .wmv
files. This may help you in verifying if there is any hardcoded sensitive
information lying anywhere in the binary. Be wary of any manipulation that
you may cause. "Winhex" is an interesting tool.

Thanks everyone,

Anyone having idea about .WMV memory corruption. How to check it?

Thanks,

Hi Megha,

I did not understand the intent of this question completely.

To my knowledge WMV files are data files. Why would you like to do a
security assessment of a data file?

The program that executes this data file (also commonly referred to as
"loader") is subject to security assessment.

WMV files are different from Flash content. Flash files (swf format)
contains code as well, that's the reason they are subject to VA.

To give an analogy, If there are multiple pdf files on a site, why would
someone do a security assessment of *.pdf file?

There could be vulnerabilities in Adobe's pdf reader software. Ideally you
should assess the loader and not the data file itself.

I am still clueless as to what could be achieved by fuzzing the wmv file or
loading it in a hex editor.

Yup, Chintan I'm talking about vulnerabilities which are caused while
processing WMV files. Even malicious input is not dangerous until its
processed. Hope it helps.

Message-ID: <FB8905AFCE852544A56870B9314D40AFB3C5@CHNMBX01.IDFC.COM>

Hacker shows off remote ATM exploit
Posted Sun Aug 1, 2010 10:06am AEST
A computer hacker has demonstrated a technique to remotely make an ATM spit out cash using the internet.
New Zealand researcher Barnaby Jack publicly showed off the "ATM jackpotting" technique at the DefCon hackers conference in Las Vagas, in the United States.
Mr Jack proved his findings using two kinds of ATMs typically found in corner stores, bars or other "stand-alone" venues in the US, but said the flaw likely exists in machines at well-known banks.
"You don't have to go to the ATM at all," Mr Jack said.
"You can do it from the comfort of your own bedroom."
Mr Jack says banks use remote management software to monitor and control their ATMs.
He says he used a weakness in that software to take control of machines over the internet.
He says his method bypasses the need to submit passwords and serial numbers to access ATMs remotely.
Once in the machines, he says he can command them to spit out cash or transfer funds.
He says he could also capture account data from magnetic strips on credit or bank cards as well as passwords punched in by ATM users.
"When you think about ATM security you generally think about the hardware side; is it bolted down and are the cameras in position," Mr Jack said.
"This is the first time anyone has taken the approach of trying to attack the underlying software.
"It is time to find software defences rather than hardware defences."
Mr Jack did not reveal specifics of the attack to hackers at the conference, but did tell ATM makers about the flaw so they could bolster machine defences.
"I might get my butt in hot water if I released the code," he said.
"I was careful not to release the keys to the kingdom."
Mr Jack says he has grown wary of ATMs since discovering the remote exploit.
"I just keep my cash under the bed now," he said.

Hi Megha,
The .WMV file format or Windows Media Video format is a MS version of the popular ASF file format which are used to store video data in compressed format.
Now scenarios may exist on how this is put on the victim system etc etc. some virus varients using WMV files etc are as below

http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_99587.htm  (The .WMV file exploits a vulnerability that allows the Windows Media Player to open the MI2.HTM file automatically. The .HTM file gives control to MI2.CHM, which then runs the MI2.EXE file)

http://www.bitdefender.com/NW1288-world--Top-Ten-E-Threats---December-2009.html  (Trojan.Wimad.Gen.1, ranking fifth with 4.57 percent of the global infections, mostly exploits the capability of ASF files to automatically download the appropriate codec from a remote location in order to deploy infected binary files on the host system. The ASF format will store data in either WMA (Windows Media Audio) or WMV (Windows Media Video) formats, which are mostly to be found on Torrent websites. When played locally, the specially-crafted WMV file would allegedly attempt to download a "special codec", which is in fact a malicious binary hosted on a third-party website.)

A GOOD Read http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=342246
Another http://msmvps.com/blogs/donna/archive/2005/01/13/31831.aspx

An Eye Opener!!!!!!!!!
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd757562.aspx
excerpt:
An ASF file can contain multiple independent or dependent streams, including multiple audio streams for multichannel audio, or multiple bit rate video streams suitable for transmission over different bandwidths. In addition to the standard audio and video media stream types, an ASF file can also contain text streams, Web pages and script commands, and any other arbitrary data type.

An ASF file is organized into sections called "objects." There are three top-level objects, a Header object and a Data object (both required), plus an optional Index object. The Header object contains general information about the file, such as file size, number of streams, error correction methods, and codecs used. Metadata is also stored here. The Header object is the only top level object that can contain other objects. The Data object contains the stream data, organized in packets. The Simple Index object contains a list of associated index/key-frame pairs that enables applications to seek through a file efficiently. The index associated with each key frame can be a presentation time, a video frame number, or a reference time stamp.

Each top-level or lower-level object begins with a globally unique identifier (GUID) and a size value. These numbers allow the file reader to parse the information at appropriate places into identifiable objects. Because of these GUIDs, lower-level objects can be sent in any order and still be recognized. The ASF format is designed to overcome inaccurate data reception. A partially downloaded ASF file can still be read, as long as it contains the Header object and at least one Data object.

And Finally a good tool to help in editing /decoding (as far as the marketing page says!!!)

http://www.radioactivepages.com/english/asfbin.html

also you can use the windows ASF file format edit SDK (don't have any idea , but worth a try)



Hope this helps

Samrat

Hi All,



Does anyone have an idea about how one should go ahead in testing .wmv files.

Also, let me know about tools, checklist if

 any.





Thanks,

Any file can be malicious data or no data :), in case of WMV files it can be
embedded with malicious content (shellcode) that gets executed when the
"loader" reads the file and vulnerability (overflow etc.. ) gets exploited.

Megha, just want to know what you want to do with the WMV files, if you want
to discover overflow vulnerbility then fuzzing and exception analysis is an
option, if you are doing an exploit analysis then you shd look for shellcode
scanners, that will try to mark out dangerous byte sequences.

Message-ID: <6F4FB1E50548CD4CACDE034CEE98E45E22607FC3@NDA-HCLC-MSG05.HCLC.CORP.HCL.IN>

Hi,

Any recommendation on configuration Audit tools for network devices like routers, switches, firewalls. I have heard about Nipper, IP Sentinel. Nessus currently supports Cisco IOS compliance audit only but I need tools with support for multiple/maximum products from different vendors like checkpoint, juniper, nipper, HP etc.

Which one gives comprehensive report, out of the box -compliance, unlimited scans,  can recommend ACL optimization for firewalls, provides  support (suggest any freeware also) and has a strong knowledgebase? I will not be looking for appliance based solutions.


Thanks,
Digvijay

Dear All,

 

Its been a while since we could gather for a chapter meeting and discuss on
variety of InfoSec issues. Lately, I have been receiving lot of calls from
members expressing their interest to attend OWASP Delhi Chapter meetings but
hectic schedule on our part made it difficult for us to devote time
organizing the meetings. May I please request members here to participate as
volunteers and carry the OWASP flagship forward. Out of several tasks, below
are few of the important ones with brief responsibility for which you may
nominate yourself as committee members to work shoulder to shoulder with
OWASP Delhi Board:

 

1.     Speaker Coordination Committee (SCC)

a.     Float the CFP (Call for papers) on the list, shortlist the
speakers/topics, share the list of speakers with WMC (point 4)

 

2.     Venue Coordination Committee (VCC)

a.     Identifying the companies who wish to sponsor our chapter meeting,
visiting the venue to approve the logistics, announcing the venue. Sharing
the list of participants with the sponsor. Advance visit before meeting to
ensure everything is plugged 

 

3.     Participant Coordination Committee (PCC)

a.     Preparing the list of participants who wish to attend the OWASP
meeting. Handing over the final list to VCC. Getting the link for agenda
from WMC and announcing it to the list. 

 

4.     Wikipedia Management Committee (WMC)

a.     Coordinate with SCC and VCC and update the meeting agenda on the
OWASP Wiki

 

What do you get in return? Visibility, credibility, learning, networking and
above all, a great level of satisfaction by devoting few hours towards a
good cause. 

 

Note: OWASP chapter meetings are open and free to all the participants.
There is no sponsorship fees attached. Sponsors only need to avail their
venue for few hours with A/V equipped along with high-tea for the
participants. In case your company wish to sponsor upcoming chapter meeting
please let us know. It doesn't cost a thing and provides a good branding
opportunity for companies to showcase their seriousness towards information
security.

 

Please write me offline with your interest to participate in any/multiple
committee(s) of your choice. Suggestions always welcome.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv Soi

Sorry for the top posting again. I am really thankful to all the members who
have expressed their willingness to volunteer for this noble cause. 

 

But what I feel like missing is, OWASP Delhi Chapter carries maximum members
in comparison to any other OWASP Chapter across the globe and still it could
only find nomination from around 10+ members expressing interest as
volunteers. It's a volunteering effort so it definitely comes from heart and
we can't force, but for those who couldn't nominate, I thought to share my
personal blog link from my Mar10 post which was on similar lines in a way,
hope should be helpful to some in some mean:
http://dhruvsoi.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-is-purpose-of-my-life.html 

 

For sure, am not trying to promote my personal blog, have got enough
readers. Everything is meant for you, just thought to share some insights.
Please consider it as a spam and ignore if you don't like it. But act before
its too late.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

Forgot to mention - OWASP Delhi Committee Members while being on the board
will be entitled to attend any OWASP Conference in Delhi at no cost (i.e.
FREE as in beer). 

 

Tomorrow evening 1800hrs has been kept as the closing time for the
nominations and we will announce the shortlisted committee members on
Friday. So, hurry up and show-up for a good cause, communities are meant to
be driven by people, for people. You are very much amongst former or the
later group but your presence in both the groups would certainly bring the
difference!

 

Look forward to your interest.

Dear All,

 

Its been a while since we could gather for a chapter meeting and discuss on
variety of InfoSec issues. Lately, I have been receiving lot of calls from
members expressing their interest to attend OWASP Delhi Chapter meetings but
hectic schedule on our part made it difficult for us to devote time
organizing the meetings. May I please request members here to participate as
volunteers and carry the OWASP flagship forward. Out of several tasks, below
are few of the important ones with brief responsibility for which you may
nominate yourself as committee members to work shoulder to shoulder with
OWASP Delhi Board:

 

1.     Speaker Coordination Committee (SCC)

a.     Float the CFP (Call for papers) on the list, shortlist the
speakers/topics, share the list of speakers with WMC (point 4)

 

2.     Venue Coordination Committee (VCC)

a.     Identifying the companies who wish to sponsor our chapter meeting,
visiting the venue to approve the logistics, announcing the venue. Sharing
the list of participants with the sponsor. Advance visit before meeting to
ensure everything is plugged 

 

3.     Participant Coordination Committee (PCC)

a.     Preparing the list of participants who wish to attend the OWASP
meeting. Handing over the final list to VCC. Getting the link for agenda
from WMC and announcing it to the list. 

 

4.     Wikipedia Management Committee (WMC)

a.     Coordinate with SCC and VCC and update the meeting agenda on the
OWASP Wiki

 

What do you get in return? Visibility, credibility, learning, networking and
above all, a great level of satisfaction by devoting few hours towards a
good cause. 

 

Note: OWASP chapter meetings are open and free to all the participants.
There is no sponsorship fees attached. Sponsors only need to avail their
venue for few hours with A/V equipped along with high-tea for the
participants. In case your company wish to sponsor upcoming chapter meeting
please let us know. It doesn't cost a thing and provides a good branding
opportunity for companies to showcase their seriousness towards information
security.

 

Please write me offline with your interest to participate in any/multiple
committee(s) of your choice. Suggestions always welcome.

 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv Soi

Chair - OWASP India, Director - OWASP Delhi Chapter

I agree with Dhruv here. Both Dhruv and I have spent a good amount of effort and time to build this chapter. The sole objective is to promote awareness and education along with professional networking through sharing of knowledge and ideas. To see only two nominations for this cause is really disappointing.

I sincerely feel that we have a lot of like minded folks on this list who can make a difference by volunteering and contributing for this noble cause.

Hoping that the message would encourage atleast few if not all to come forward.

Sorry for the top posting again. I am really thankful to all the members who have expressed their willingness to volunteer for this noble cause. 

 

But what I feel like missing is, OWASP Delhi Chapter carries maximum members in comparison to any other OWASP Chapter across the globe and still it could only find nomination from around 10+ members expressing interest as volunteers. It?s a volunteering effort so it definitely comes from heart and we can?t force, but for those who couldn?t nominate, I thought to share my personal blog link from my Mar10 post which was on similar lines in a way, hope should be helpful to some in some mean: http://dhruvsoi.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-is-purpose-of-my-life.html

Dear All,

ZeuS has reappeared, but this time the target was British financial
institutions and cyber thieves were able to siphon cash worth ?675,000 from
customers online bank accounts at a top high street bank. Out of the
computers in which Zeus was detected,55% computers were having up-to-date
antivirus, 14% were having antivirus installed but it was not up-to-date,
while 31% were not having antivirus installed onto them.

Here is the link where you can find more details:

Hi Padma,
One of the basic tools that could be used to start with is ITR(Interactive 
TCP Relay).It acts as a proxy and can be used to intercept thick client 
communications. Had started working on this but could not continue. Let me 
know if you find some stuff.
 Liked a few links:

Rarely the Java clients use HTTP for communication, so MiTM is not possible.
Other way is to Decompile them, perform code review, alter code, recompile
evil client and send custom attacks. You can use Java decompilers such as
jad.

The malicious user can capture the traffic b/w the thick client and the
server. He can then replay it with the modified values. If server is
vulnerable enough, MITM attacks are still possible (although a little
difficult) in case of thick clients.

Hi Padma,

I have personally found Echo Mirage tool useful for security testing of a thick client application.
Like a proxy tool for testing web application, Echo Mirage can be used to intercept and modify the request from the client to the server and perform most of your validation related attacks.

u can use jclasslib byte code viewer to patch/view byte code, another tool
that can be used is CCK (class contructor kit), or if u want to write some
specific tool u can use BCEL (Byte Code Engineering Library), another thing
you wud need is a copy for VM Specification of java (for byte code
references and class file format), In case the code is not obfuscated u can
use JAD, JODE etc to decompile the files and locate the code u want to
alter, but if the code is obfuscated u wud just have the above mentioned
byte code manipulation tools.
U can also attach JDB to the target, but if its in a release version u won;t
be able to manipulate local variables, but u can monitor and manipulate
member variables.

Firstly thanks All for the quick responses. 

I tried Echo Mirage, wireshark and ITR, but scope became very limited. I 
would definitely try out the other options suggested. 

I found another tool JavaSnoop, but i think we can only snoop a jar file. 
My app is an exe client. Has anybody worked on it? Any suggestions about 
it?

Hi Padma Sriram Iyer,
    This actually depends on the type of application.

Is this a java applet kind of application? If so, you will not have to worry
about the "transport layer insecurities" because applet communication is
tunnelled. That makes it a little difficult. Also, if it runs on SSL, then
its a biot m,ore safer in terms of MITM attacks etc.

If this is going to be a desktop application or even an applest based
application look for these things:

0. Command Injection flaws (OS Injection, VM Injections etc)
1. Logic Flaws
2. Authentication & Authorization Flaws
3. Improper configurations
4. Single/Multi- Factor Authentication
5. Unsafe code execution
6. Memory Leaks
7. Race Conditions
8. De-compilable code
9. Untrusted execution
10. Compliance & Regulatory Laws being ignored if any

These are just some of the points that I could come up with. Thinking along
these lines could get you still many more ideas.

Thanks & Regards,
~Venk!

Hi Gunwant, it would be great if you could share some tools that you
use for MITM of thick clients (may be some proxies) using TCP as the
communication protocol. I am more interested in understanding about
intercepting thick client communications where in the client does not
provide an option to set the proxy server.

ITR is one of the tools, however it is useful in cases where client
allows to configure proxy.

Please note that I am talking of TCP and not HTTP.

To my knowledge the only way to do so is reverse engineer not sure how
correct I actually am.
Any additional pointers would be much appreciated.

Nilesh, MIM (Man in the middle) attack can happen to any communications which uses TCP/IP since, TCP/IP communicates everything in plain text.

@Sriram, I failed to understand that why a Java thick Client is different from normal Application Security testing ?? (do not read "Web Application")

You need to follow the same principles of "Cryptographic Usage", "Transport Layer Security", "Session Management", "Authentication", "Authorization" & "Proper Exception Handling not revealing the Server internals", etc.? Listed only most important.

Rarely the Java clients use HTTP for communication, so MiTM is not possible.
Other way is to Decompile them, perform code review, alter code, recompile evil client and send custom attacks. You can use Java decompilers such as jad.

Yes EchoMirage is good tool for interception. The problem with the tool is
that you can't exceed your payloads more than the size of the original
variable. That doesn't give the flexibility to try longer payloads. The size
is fixed.
Correct if I am wrong

yes ... Echo mirage is  the One which works for exe files and it works on 
my application as well, but the limitation remains the same as nilesh has 
pointed out.

Yes EchoMirage is good tool for interception. The problem with the tool is 
that you can't exceed your payloads more than the size of the original 
variable. That doesn't give the flexibility to try longer payloads. The 
size is fixed.
Correct if I am wrong

RE: [Owasp-delhi] Thick client security testing





Hi Padma, 
  
I have personally found Echo Mirage tool useful for security testing of a 
thick client application. 
Like a proxy tool for testing web application, Echo Mirage can be used to 
intercept and modify the request from the client to the server and perform 
most of your validation related attacks.

Hi Robin,

These are some of the problem with the tool:

1. Multithread communication : many thread sending data, makes it impossible
to find the packet to edit,
there maybe one thread that works like a poller if a timeout occurs on that
thread because u are busy editing value in packet sent from some other
thread it halts the process.

2. U can only change values in the assigned buffer, if the intercepted data
is 10 bytes u can't make it send 11 bytes.

3. Uses API hooking, because of that is very crash prone.
the best and reliable way is to put break points using a debugger on
(ws2_32.dll) open and recieve functions and edit the values before it sends,
using a debugger all the three above problems gets solved. Gives u leg space
to inject ur data.

Ollydbg,pydbg,immunity is a good debugger, u can write scipts in them to
automate what ever ur trying.

Hi,

Using Echo Mirage one can send data more than the assigned buffer.
When Echo Mirage intercepts data, suppose say there is a parameter 'a'.
Normally we can change it to only 1 byte data like say 'b' , '1' etc.
Instead of doing this, if you want to send more data than the assigned
buffer,
I want to try injections in the parameter 'a'
Eg:  ' or 1=1--

so one can copy this from notepad or anywhere and go to Echo mirage
interceptor and select the parameter in this case 'a' and say ctrl+v. Echo
mirage ask you to select the data format, select Text the first option and
say OK. Now 'a' will be replaced with '' or 1=1--' .

Try this and out and correct me if i am wrong.

Hi Kishore,

thanks for this very usefull tip, it does work!! but strange they don;t
allow this kind of edition when we type directly into the window, it simply
replaces it. And i never thought of doing a ctrl-V :).

I always thought why they have implemented such a functionality, because api
hooking does allow control over the buffer as well.
