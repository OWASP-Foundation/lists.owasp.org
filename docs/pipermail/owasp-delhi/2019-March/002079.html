*Session Abstracts*
--------------------------------

*Bringing Left Shift Security Change in India E-Community #BugBounty by
Avinash Jain:*

In the technology-powered era, we can not deny the fact of every increasing
cyber attack. One of the main reasons is the lack of focus and awareness of
security. While Bug Bounty Programs has become one of the common ways for
big companies to invite security researcher around the globe and help to
find security loopholes, there is something more in Bug Bounty Programs,
something more than Bounty which we as a security researcher or bug bounty
hunter overlook. Bug Bounty can help bring a &quot;Left shift&quot; security change
in companies. This is not just a technical shift but also a cultural and
mentality shift. How through Bug Bounty I was able to bring a &#8220;Left Shift
Security&#8221; change in India E-market? is the essence of the talk. What is
that &quot;broader picture&quot; behind the Bug Bounties which has to be looked upon
and why it is important is the target to achieve by this talk.

*Conquering Git: The only version control system by Pankaj Mourya*

Git is the most widely used version control system. Whether you are a
developer, project manager or student, if you are working on a file-based
project either individually or in a team, it becomes very important to keep
track of changes we make or our team. Doing it manually becomes a
challenging task and hence we make use of git. Git helps us to manage our
work both locally and remotely while keeping a record of every change being
done.

In this session, we will learn the basics of Git, how to track our files in
git repository, how to do commit, rebase, git history and Git distributed
system.

Flow:

   - Introduction
   - What is Git -
   - Four Areas of Git
      - Keys and Values
      - Branches
      - Git Rebase
      - Git Reset
   - Git History -
      - Exploring Past
      - Fixing Mistakes
   - Distributed Version Control


*OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities by Astha Sahni and Samaan Fatima:*

This talk will cover OWASP Top 10 risks

Feel free to get in touch with any questions

See you there.
