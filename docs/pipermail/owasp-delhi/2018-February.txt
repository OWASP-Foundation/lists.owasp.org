*Title: AppSec Testing Beyond Pen Test by Bhushan Gupta*

*Abstract:* Web application security has a broad scope that spans from
network communication to browser behaviors to backend applications and
finally to database servers. Validating security of all these components
can be a daunting task and take a considerable effort. Penetration is the
most prevalent testing method used today for validating web application
security. The question is, ?does it cover all the basis?? Penetration
testing is a black-box type testing that a QA engineer applies from the
hacker?s perspective. While it provides a comfort level, it does not ensure
that the application has been developed with security in mind and that it
meets the three basic requirements of security namely, Confidentiality,
Integrity, and Availability (CIA). The CIA framework builds intrinsic
security and thus ensures an increased confidence level. This framework
should be complemented with the penetration testing.

This talk focuses on how to align the security validation of a web
application with the three basic elements of security namely,
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). The test effectiveness
can be achieved by analyzing the requirements of each element and
identifying the potential breaches that can compromise each element. The
efficiency should be built by relating these breaches with the known OWASP
Top 10 and other vulnerabilities and, leveraging that knowledge to identify
the testing approach - static and dynamic throughout the SDLC.

*Bio: *Bhushan Gupta is a Principal consultant at Gupta Consulting LLC.,
Bhushan Gupta is passionate about development methods and tools that yield
more secure web applications especially in the agile software development
environment. As a researcher, he has a keen interest in understanding and
applying fundamental principles and known methodologies to develop
dependable and secure software solutions. His interests extend to Social
Engineering and Attack Surface Analysis. Bhushan worked at Hewlett-Packard
for 13 years in various roles including software quality lead, engineer,
software process architect, and software productivity manager. He then
developed a strong interest in web application security while working as a
quality engineer for Nike Inc. Bhushan has been studying various facets of
web application security and promoting how to apply common sense approach
to build secure solutions. He is a certified Six Sigma Black Belt (HP and
ASQ) and an adjunct faculty member at the Oregon Institute of Technology in
Software Engineering. To learn more about Bhushan?s contributions to SDLC,

*Title: WiFi Security Beyond Password Cracking*

*Abstract: *The speaker will demonstrate the following attacks on wifi
networks:

   1. Packet injection in protocols such as DHCP, DNS, etc.
   2. Phishing wifi clients using captive portal

*Bio: *Mohit is a Network security Enthusiast and Final Year Btech ( ECE )
student @ NIT Delhi

See you there.

Thanks
