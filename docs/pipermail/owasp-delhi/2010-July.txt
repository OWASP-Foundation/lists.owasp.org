In general, many venodors of the said software indicate this in their EULA. That should dictate if an application can be RE-e or not. You have to go through the EUAL to see if its ok or not.

Hi Experts,

I need a small help from you.

Is RE legal for security assessments of products purchased from vendors?

There has been a bit of confusion around RE topic.

I know it is illegal to do RE to steal the idea, however this one, I
need feedback from you folks.

If you can share some authoritative resources that could confirm on
the legality/illegality, it would be great.

Friends,
I have some great news regarding ClubHack to share

a) Keynote guest of ClubHack2010 is decided and announced. Non other 
than *Bruce Schneier* will be giving the keynote this year. If you don't 
know him, you don't deserve to be on a security mailing list

b) CFP for ClubHack2010 is now open. Check http://clubhack.com/2010 for 
more details

c) http://clubhack.com as been redesigned into a complete portal now and 
can be used as central Indian portal for everything under sun in 
security. If you want to be a part of contributing authors, please get 
in touch. If you have further ideas which can be implemented, send in a 
mail to me.

d) few more products are under development & will be released soon. So 
keep an eye on http://clubhack.com and @clubhack

Hope you all like it and would contribute in all possible ways to make 
it big

Thanks
