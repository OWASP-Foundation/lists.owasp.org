Dear OWASP Members,

 

I first want to thank all of you for being supportive to OWASP Delhi
Chapter. I would now like to thank Dhruv for his efforts and initiative in
providing this platform to all the members to come together and support
OWASP's initiatives.

 

As Dhruv mentioned, our aim is to support OWASP's inititatives and take it
further by extending opportunities for learning, peer networking and
research activities to our members. Now this will involve a lot of support
from our members through volunteer participation in chapter activities. We
request all the members to volunteer for such activties and help chapter
achieve its goals. I firmly belive that together, we can take this chapter
to new heights.

 

We will soon be sharing some exciting news with you on chapter intitiatives
and activities. Stay Tuned:-)

 

 

 

Thanks

Puneet Mehta
