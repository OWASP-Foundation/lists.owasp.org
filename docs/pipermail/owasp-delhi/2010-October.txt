*Reverse Honey Trap - Striking Deep inside Online Web Antivirus Engines and
Analyzers*


Web based online anti viruses are used heavily for scanning malware files
and providing the resultant output. There are number of online service
providers which perform inline scanning of uploaded malware executables by
the normal user or the victims. This process is based on the hierarchical
functions and different steps opted to analyze the viruses and other worm
activities. The infections occur dynamically when the executable becomes
active in the environment. Everything is automated in this process as
servers residing at the backend scan the executable and sent the information
to other third party servers for secondary analysis or updating their record
directly. That?s how the normal functioning of free online malware scanner
works.

Analysis<http://secniche.blogspot.com/2010/10/phoenix-exploit-kit-24-analysis.html>Phoenix
exploit kit is one of the best Browser Exploit Pack(BEP)in the market

see plethora of advancements in this BEP. In this post , we are aiming to
disclose some of the findings and reviews about the latest Phoenix BEP
version 2.4. Primarily, we will be talking about the following metrics in

Hello,

If I understand correctly the Traffic Infection Rate is the overall
infection rate. 70% - 80% in this regard seems too high than the normal
"industry standard" of <25%. Also, looking at the OS based infection rates,
the rate of 70-80% seems logically incorrect.

Can you please check this?

*Notorious Datacenter Support Systems - Pwning through Outer Sphere*
*Exploitation Analysis of Help Desk Systems*

The online world has been encountering massive levels of malware attacks in
the
recent times. The outbreak of injected malware has reinforced its
devastating stance by
contaminating a large number of websites. Most of the traces have been found
in the
websites under shared and virtual hosting which further includes content
from third
party delivery networks. Well, it?s the truth that a minor inherited
weakness in applied
software can cause havoc if exploited appropriately. Recent mass level
attacks have
endorsed this fact. This paper talks about the nature of techniques used by
malware
writers engaged in performing continuous analysis of differential malware.
The paper
aims at knowledge sharing by presenting the layout of datacenter compromises
through
simple support systems used for assisting the customers. The reality of
support system
shows the nature of insecure work functionality which is exploited heavily
by malware
writers. This paper is an outcome of real time analysis of compromised
systems. This
paper has been generalized for security and responsible disclosure reasons.

Message-ID: <3D263F3272026041925D690276949830019749C9@IND-MHP1MCL001.mastek.com>

If I had to provide access to the enterprise portals to some of the people in my partner organization (external users), I need to authenticate them.

If my internal users are using Active Directory for authentication to the Enterprise Portals, will it be a good design to create external users in the AD and allow authentication to the portal?
Or one should go with doing custom authentication of the external users in Database and "not touch" Active Directory"?
Or setup federated "trust" between organization Active Directory (assuming both have same Active Directory technology)?

My take is that Active Directory is the best product to manage user authentication and should be used for creating external users too.

Your thoughts please.

Dear,

This is how we did. We did it through the AD. Devised a policy mechanism to first identify all external partners. Maybe you start with $ as a prefix and then follow your AD ID policy. Additionally federated trust will help if you want to devise a mechanism of Full, or partial access or segmented access.

AD has immense potential and decidedly does good as an authentication manager. However there is one issue and you have to be very cautious while purchasing NAS or SAN boxes. Check for compatibility with AD. On the distribution front, all 'A' class packages  talk with AD seamlessly. Hope this helps.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Is it a good design to put external users in ActiveDirectory

 

If I had to provide access to the enterprise portals to some of the people in my partner organization (external users), I need to authenticate them.

 

If my internal users are using Active Directory for authentication to the Enterprise Portals, will it be a good design to create external users in the AD and allow authentication to the portal?

Or one should go with doing custom authentication of the external users in Database and "not touch" Active Directory"? 

Or setup federated "trust" between organization Active Directory (assuming both have same Active Directory technology)?

 

My take is that Active Directory is the best product to manage user authentication and should be used for creating external users too. 

 

Your thoughts please. 

 

Thanks & Regards,
