Message-ID: <CAAvjMhMOmMQP2upc8-3gfPM5bqLNJN2=agEb9_Ade0QxQ2w9Yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Announcing the OWASP Delhi chapter April meet on 23rd April, 2016
(Saturday) - 10:45 AM IST

Note ? All OWASP chapter meets are free and open to everyone. Prior

*Please RSVP/register here *
http://bit.ly/243Pfhd

*Details: *
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Delhi_NCR

*Session Details/Agenda:*
-----------------------------------------

*11:00 AM - 11:15 AM:* Introduction

*11:15 AM - 11:30 AM: News Bytes* by *Arpit Maheshwari*

*11:30 AM - 12:30 PM:* *Cloud Security & Best Practices in AWS* by *Ankit
Giri*

*Abstract:* - Few instances of breach in cloud (AWS)
- Account compromise via leak of AWS Keys on GitHub
- SSRF attack
- Publicly accessible S3 Bucket, folders and files
- How Jenkins (CI)can lead to disaster
- Best practices to protect AWS account from unauthorized access and usage

*12:40 PM - 12:55 PM: *Tea/Coffee/Networking Break

*01:00 PM ? 02:15 PM:* *Secrets of Google VRP. The bug hunter's guide to
sending great bugs *by* Krzysztof Kotowicz, Google Security Team* (Remote -
Switzerland)

*Abstract:* Did you ever want to know how a CSRF may be more dangerous than
a stack buffer overflow? Are you curious what makes a bug critical? Have
you ever wondered why Google Security Bot doesn't pay for open redirects,
and not every XSS is the same? During this workshop, you'll get to know the
answer to those questions - and all other secrets of the Google VRP too.
You'll see how Google Security Team evaluates the incoming vulnerability
reports, what do we focus on, and how to make our day by sending us a great
bug. Several examples of vulnerabilities sent to our VRP will be presented
- both successful submissions and rejected ones. We'll talk extensively
about the differences between those to help you find and report the bugs
worth your time. We'll discuss various OWASP Top 10 vulnerability types and
how do they relate to Google VRP rules. Come to the workshop, talk to us
and learn how to become one of the top bughunters!"

*02:15 PM - 2:30 PM:* Feedback and Topic Discussion for Next Month

*When:* 23rd April, 2016 (Saturday) - 10:45 AM IST (Please be on time)

that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased (partially or wholly) before, it will fall under
current research category even though there are enhancements/changes
to the original
research.

2. Current Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Submission Format
------------------------------
Email the paper to: cfp at hardwear.io
The subject should be: CFP EU 2016 <Paper Title>
Email Body:
Name
Handle
Talk Category (Mentioned above i.e. research/technical/tool)
Time required (including 5-10 mins of QA)
Paper Title
Country (and City) of residence
Organization and Designation
Contact Number
Have you presented or submitted this paper at any other conference(s),
magazine(s) or portals?
Yes, No.
If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the previous
ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or are due
to be given elsewhere prior to hardwear.io will be considered as current
research category talks unless they consist of cutting edge and ground
breaking technology, which is at the judgement of the review committee.

Are you releasing an open source hardware(or specification)?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the design for review)

Are you releasing an exploit?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the source and vulnerability details for review)

Are you releasing a new vulnerability/Zero-day?

(If yes, please send us the details, including reproduction procedure,
for review)

Why do you think your paper is different/innovative and how does it
qualify as new work/research(for new Research category only)?

Are there any live demonstrations (These earn you good points during review)?
Yes/No.
(If Yes, how many? Also please explain each demo)

Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

Paper Abstract ? Please provide detailed working or your
research/work. The more details you provide the better it is for the
reviewers. Please keep the abstract to the point. Please do not try to
hide the technical details or say ?I can?t disclose it till bla bla?
as it does not help the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a
low score because of insufficient information available in the
abstract. Please make sure to add as much technical details as
possible as short abstracts also tend to get low score due to
insufficient information.

Your high resolution photo (attached)

Note
-------------------------
Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected. The Abstract should
clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail and merely
mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the research

Hello folks,

Jim Weiler from the OWASP Boston chapter just released a cheatsheet on 3rd
party JavaScript management. I think this is a solid and very interesting
piece of work. It address a security concern which many website operators
face.

Take a look, your feedback is - as always - appreciated.
