Sushil,

 

I did not receive any "ActiveX code" in the mail. However, the URLs being
mentioned in the mail are definitely malicious and they might have flagged
your phishing filter. I do appreciate your concern but, Praveen being a
security researcher, would have taken active precautions. 

 

Anyways, the website is badly "pwned" and someone should notify its
webmaster. I guess it doesn't pose an immediate danger as all the malicious
URLs were brought down, once they were detected by the Shadowserver and APWG
projects. 

 

Best,

Pukhraj

Customers"

Hi List,

 

I figured I'd try sharing a new paper I completed and posted to my site

yesterday.

 

The paper is based off some of the work I've been discussing at various

conferences recently in relation to the man-in-the-browser attack vectors,

and their effect on financial Web applications - in particular, consumer

online banking.

 

Titled "Continuing Business with Malware Infected Customers" looks at the

threat from the perspective of "with so many infected computers out there,

and the number not likely to go down, what sort of things can you build in

to your Web application to make it more resilient to man-in-the-browser

attack vectors?". As I'm sure most of the list already knows, the

man-in-the-browser vector is particularly insidious and defeats just about

all the current protection technologies out there - largely because it's

such a convenient vector for social engineering. Anyhow, this paper is

designed to help Web developers take a closer look at their transactional

Web applications and provide various levels of best practice advice on

helping to mitigate the threat. In addition, I'm aiming to raise business

awareness of the fact that they will increasingly just have to assume that a

sizable percentage of their customer base is probably infected - and develop

protection strategies accordingly.

 

The paper can be found at::

http://www.technicalinfo.net/papers/MalwareInfectedCustomers.html

 

Cheers,

 

Gunter

 

 

The intro/abstract for the paper...

 

Continuing Business with Malware Infected Customers - Best Practices and the

Security Ergonomics of Web Application Design for Compromised Customer Hosts

 

Today's media is full of statistics and stories detailing how the Internet

has become an increasingly dangerous place for all concerned. Figures of

tens of millions and hundreds of millions of bot-infected computers are

regularly discussed, along with approximations that between one-quarter and

one-third of all home computer systems are already infected with some form

of malware. With a conservative estimate of 1.4 billion computers browsing

the Internet on a daily basis (mid-2008 figures), that could equate to

upwards of 420 million computers that can't be trusted - and the numbers

could be higher as criminals increasingly target Web browser technologies

with malicious Web content - infecting hundreds of millions more along the

way.

Despite these kinds of warnings and their backing statistics, online

businesses have yet to fully grasp the significance of the threat. Most of

the advice about dealing with the problem has focused on attempting to

correct the client-side infection and yet, despite the education campaigns

and ubiquity of desktop anti-virus solutions, the number of infected

computers has continued to rise. The problem facing online businesses going

forward is, if upwards of one-third of their customers are likely to be

using computers infected with malware to conduct business transactions with

them, how should they continue to do business with an infected customer

base?

This paper discusses many of the best practices businesses can adopt for

their Web application design and back-office support processes in order to

minimize this growing threat, along with helping to reduce several of the

risks posed with continuing to do business customers likely to be operating

infected computers.

Hello All,

I am delighted to share the recent OWASP updates with all the members
here. After the OWASP EU Summit held early this month in Portugal,
OWASP has recently formed global committees
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Committee_Pages].

Puneet Mehta is now part of global chapter committee
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Chapter_Committee] and I
become the part of global conference committee
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Conferences_Committee]. This
is really going to help us in bringing further application security
awareness into Indian industry and invite the best application
security experts under a common platform.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] NDTV.com classified by google search as a possible
	attack site serving malware
Message-ID: <73e1ba30811210902j33207778g29ce6e4fc7f6532c@mail.gmail.com>

See advisory here
http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/videos.aspx&hl=en

I couldn't see the malware sites mentioned on the advisory serving out
from ndtv.com anymore on my firebug console so I figure that these
vulnerabilities might have been gone from their site now. Does someone
has more information as to what happened here, was it their windows
servers that got compromised or XSS issues from the advertising or
user generated content served by them.

Cheers!!

This is the second time I have heard of NDTV being compromised. The first
time it was compromised with the MPack exploitation toolkit. 

The infection via d0uhunqn-dot-cn is pretty old. It seems that website
remained compromised for a long time. Sad! It's a typical shotgun attack,
although the malicious links seem to be offline now. Couple of projects have
crawled through those malicious websites which have been mentioned in the
Google diagnostics page (CastleCops, Shadowserver, Symantec SafeWeb, et al).
Some of the exploits being served are old (from the Storm Worm days):

Hi Pukhraj,

Thanks for your explanation. As I understand that a shotgun attack is
the one where the attacking malware site attempts to exploit multiple
vulnerabilities ranging from javascript to shockwave objects ?
The url you referred lists out the type of malicious SQL injection
request that will compromise an MS-SQL server( or can it compromise
other any other database servers ) by updating the open table_cursors,
thereby injecting javascript into resultsets which are being fetched
by the web-pages which thus get written out into the webpages being
served and execute a shotgun attack on endusers computers. Is my
understanding correct.

Thanks
-Tarun

Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit seemed
too trivial for my attention.

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the
line: "launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.") and the subsequent malware it was
trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they got
something juicy.

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike say
buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term created
by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. This one
would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on fancy
definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of nested
iframes.

Best,
Pukhraj

Hi Pukhraj,

Thanks for your explanation. As I understand that a shotgun attack is
the one where the attacking malware site attempts to exploit multiple
vulnerabilities ranging from javascript to shockwave objects ?
The url you referred lists out the type of malicious SQL injection
request that will compromise an MS-SQL server( or can it compromise
other any other database servers ) by updating the open table_cursors,
thereby injecting javascript into resultsets which are being fetched
by the web-pages which thus get written out into the webpages being
served and execute a shotgun attack on endusers computers. Is my
understanding correct.

Thanks

Thanks for pointing out Plash.

It *seems* to be an exploitation.  I didnt have enough time to analyze it,
so I was hoping that someone from owasp delhi would confirm whether it is
an exploitation or not. "Print this page" link didnt work - it just showed
an alert box.  I would prefer to be reasonably sure that it is not a
programming issue.

What do other guys in the mailing list say? Report it right away or confirm
the issue and report it?

IRCTC seems to have been exploited by an XSS vuln. After booking the
ticket, when you click on the print this page link, an alert ("hi")
appears. This is the status today morning. I didnt hav etime to analyze as
I had to rush to office. Will see if I can spend some time from office.

Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit seemed
too trivial for my attention.

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the
line: "launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.") and the subsequent malware it was
trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they got
something juicy.

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike say
buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term created
by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. This one
would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on fancy
definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of nested
iframes.

Best,
Pukhraj

The security circus demands that you investigate the issue and only
then report it.

Plash,
A hunch hardly qualifies as a full-disclosure.

The security circus demands that you investigate the issue and only
then report it.

Plash,
A hunch hardly qualifies as a full-disclosure.

If you think they would understand XSS, go ahead and report this issue. And
if you think otherwise, even the confirmation won't be of any use :-) 

Be generic, call it a bug and report the issue without being worried about
software bug or XSS. If they offer some remuneration then no harm in going
ahead to confirm this one or may be finding more juicy stuff. I would prefer
to confirm vulnerabilities for our clients or some software products rather
offering free consulting services to irresponsible companies those deploy
insecure software and make their customers suffer...If you find any
vulnerability on the wild, no doubt report it in ethical way! But no reason
to spend time over it, where you don't have any personal or professional
interest!

Thanks for pointing out Plash.

It *seems* to be an exploitation.  I didnt have enough time to analyze it,
so I was hoping that someone from owasp delhi would confirm whether it is
an exploitation or not. "Print this page" link didnt work - it just showed
an alert box.  I would prefer to be reasonably sure that it is not a
programming issue.

What do other guys in the mailing list say? Report it right away or confirm
the issue and report it?

IRCTC seems to have been exploited by an XSS vuln. After booking the
ticket, when you click on the print this page link, an alert ("hi")
appears. This is the status today morning. I didnt hav etime to analyze as
I had to rush to office. Will see if I can spend some time from office.

Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit seemed
too trivial for my attention.

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the
line: "launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.") and the subsequent malware it was
trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they got
something juicy.

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike say
buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term created
by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. This one
would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on fancy
definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of nested
iframes.

Best,
Pukhraj

Hi Pukhraj,

Thanks for your explanation. As I understand that a shotgun attack is
the one where the attacking malware site attempts to exploit multiple
vulnerabilities ranging from javascript to shockwave objects ?
The url you referred lists out the type of malicious SQL injection
request that will compromise an MS-SQL server( or can it compromise
other any other database servers ) by updating the open table_cursors,
thereby injecting javascript into resultsets which are being fetched
by the web-pages which thus get written out into the webpages being
served and execute a shotgun attack on endusers computers. Is my
understanding correct.

Thanks

I am sure, they have people hired to ensure security of thier critical
application. The question is are these so called security
professionals competent to perform the job that they are hired for...???? Or
is it a quarterly automated pen test performed last time that apparently
missed to catch the jewel crown "XSS"..:-)

Whatever, but then who cares if the security professionals hadn't healthy
breakfast or had a fight with spouse to miss the XSS while testing the
application.Found a bug, report it to the company and then, none of my
business to confirm the bug or understand their quarterly or annual pen-test
programs. If they need assistance to understand and fix the bug then no free
lunches!

Be generic, call it a bug and report the issue without being worried about
software bug or XSS. If they offer some remuneration then no harm in going
ahead to confirm this one or may be finding more juicy stuff. I would prefer
to confirm vulnerabilities for our clients or some software products rather
offering free consulting services to irresponsible companies those deploy
insecure software and make their customers suffer...If you find any
vulnerability on the wild, no doubt report it in ethical way! But no reason

Thanks for pointing out Plash.

It *seems* to be an exploitation.  I didnt have enough time to analyze it,
so I was hoping that someone from owasp delhi would confirm whether it is
an exploitation or not. "Print this page" link didnt work - it just showed
an alert box.  I would prefer to be reasonably sure that it is not a
programming issue.

What do other guys in the mailing list say? Report it right away or confirm
the issue and report it?

IRCTC seems to have been exploited by an XSS vuln. After booking the
ticket, when you click on the print this page link, an alert ("hi")
appears. This is the status today morning. I didnt hav etime to analyze as
I had to rush to office. Will see if I can spend some time from office.

Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit seemed
too trivial for my attention.

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the
line: "launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.") and the subsequent malware it was
trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they got
something juicy.

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike say
buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term created
by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. This one
would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on fancy
definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of nested
iframes.

Best,
Pukhraj

vulnerabilities ranging from javascript to shockwave objects ?
The url you referred lists out the type of malicious SQL injection
request that will compromise an MS-SQL server( or can it compromise
other any other database servers ) by updating the open table_cursors,
thereby injecting javascript into resultsets which are being fetched
by the web-pages which thus get written out into the webpages being
served and execute a shotgun attack on endusers computers. Is my
understanding correct.

Thanks
-Tarun

Vipul,

 

This group is indeed to help the community and such counter comments are
part of every discussion. Few of the posts might be of interest and few are
of least interest, after all every one is free to post his/her personal
views. We are moderating this list to intercept and stop any nasty post but
not blocking anyone's views. And most of the time such open comments are
found on security mailing lists be it full-disclosure or securityfocus that
work somewhat different than typical developer mailing lists, where
generally we find:

 

If ($post=="technical")

{

Reply() && Enjoy();

}

else

{

NULL;

}

 

You have already unsubscribed from this list but like I said, it is open and
free to all. So, as and when you like to rejoin, you are most welcome! You
might have automatically subscribed due to participation in some of the
OWASP meeting/conference.

 

Cheers!

Dhruv

Instead of proving to be helpful, I am finding this list practicing to be
more biased and sarcastic. Instead of providing some breakthroughs or
knowledge sharing people here try to send personal comments that are of
least interest for this group. 

 

I don't know how I got subscribed automatically to this list. Any ideas how
to unsubscribe from this group?

Or is it a quarterly automated pen test performed last time that apparently

Thanks for pointing out Plash.

It *seems* to be an exploitation.  I didnt have enough time to analyze it,
so I was hoping that someone from owasp delhi would confirm whether it is
an exploitation or not. "Print this page" link didnt work - it just showed
an alert box.  I would prefer to be reasonably sure that it is not a
programming issue.

What do other guys in the mailing list say? Report it right away or confirm
the issue and report it?

IRCTC seems to have been exploited by an XSS vuln. After booking the
ticket, when you click on the print this page link, an alert ("hi")
appears. This is the status today morning. I didnt hav etime to analyze as
I had to rush to office. Will see if I can spend some time from office.

Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit seemed
too trivial for my attention.

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the
line: "launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.") and the subsequent malware it was
trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they got
something juicy.

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike say
buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term created
by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. This one
would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on fancy
definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of nested
iframes.

Best,
Pukhraj

Message-ID: <OFF259A332.72E375EA-ON6525750F.0026348A-6525750F.00289BD6@tcs.com>

I had to book another ticket, and now, given what I observed, I feel that 
it is infact an XSS exploitation done by a script kiddie. I didnt do any 
technical analysis, since I get to the XSSd page only after booking a 
ticket.

This is one of the scenarios, where even though I knew it to be very 
unsafe, I had to provide my credit card details to the site knowing full 
well that it could be going to the wrong hands. 

One consolation is the Verified by Visa stuff. My card's payment gateway 
will ask me for a password during online transactions. And Stan Chart's 
payment gateway is using an SSL cert by Verisign which has expired years 
ago. This is a serious issue for me and am going to return the Manhattan 
card.   Since the Verified by Visa is asking for a password in a separate 
site, I guess IRCTC's vulnerabilities cannot read that passcode. However I 
am aware that using the card info provided at the site, duplicate physical 
cards may be created thus bypassing the Verified by Visa.

Just my thoughts. 

Puneet, the security pen test might have been done by the lowest bidder!

IRCTC seems to have been exploited by an XSS vuln. After booking the
ticket, when you click on the print this page link, an alert ("hi")
appears. This is the status today morning. I didnt hav etime to analyze as
I had to rush to office. Will see if I can spend some time from office.

Tarun,

You are correct on that one; I missed mentioning that as the exploit 
seemed
too trivial for my attention.

When I went through the blog entry, my focus immediately jumped to the
subsequent iframes which were being launched (the ones mentioned after the
line: "launches several iframes that launch several other attacks. very
nice. I'll let you pull down that code.") and the subsequent malware it 
was
trying to load. I was really keen to pull them down and see if they got
something juicy.

Loosely speaking, a shotgun attack is not bound to a definition, unlike 
say
buffer overflows, as you may better understand; it was just a term created
by my team at Symantec to make the life and explanations easier. This one
would still come under the shotgun category (duhh - too hard on fancy
definitions) as there were multiple exploits loaded in a sequence of 
nested
iframes.

Best,
Pukhraj

the one where the attacking malware site attempts to exploit multiple

The url you referred lists out the type of malicious SQL injection
request that will compromise an MS-SQL server( or can it compromise
other any other database servers ) by updating the open table_cursors,
thereby injecting javascript into resultsets which are being fetched
by the web-pages which thus get written out into the webpages being
served and execute a shotgun attack on endusers computers. Is my
understanding correct.

Thanks

That's funny! A redirection to malicious website to download some browser
exploit and then launching a pharming attack would have helped the script
kiddie to gain much more out of it ;-) I am not sure, if it is already the
case.

 

No learning from 9/11, no compliance enforcement by govt., neither in the
industry nor in the country! Oops! We apologize but this is the very first
time, we have faced such attacks in our country! And the end customers,
clients and civilians are left to suffer for their sins of being here! Was
it sarcastic though? It was intended to be! Lol.

I had to book another ticket, and now, given what I observed, I feel that it
is infact an XSS exploitation done by a script kiddie. I didnt do any
technical analysis, since I get to the XSSd page only after booking a
ticket. 

This is one of the scenarios, where even though I knew it to be very unsafe,
I had to provide my credit card details to the site knowing full well that
it could be going to the wrong hands. 

One consolation is the Verified by Visa stuff. My card's payment gateway
will ask me for a password during online transactions. And Stan Chart's
payment gateway is using an SSL cert by Verisign which has expired years
ago. This is a serious issue for me and am going to return the Manhattan
card.   Since the Verified by Visa is asking for a password in a separate
site, I guess IRCTC's vulnerabilities cannot read that passcode. However I
am aware that using the card info provided at the site, duplicate physical
cards may be created thus bypassing the Verified by Visa. 

Just my thoughts. 

Puneet, the security pen test might have been done by the lowest bidder!

I am sure, they have people hired to ensure security of thier critical
application. The question is are these so called security professionals
competent to perform the job that they are hired for...???? Or is it a
quarterly automated pen test performed last time that apparently missed to
catch the jewel crown "XSS"..:-)

Be generic, call it a bug and report the issue without being worried about
software bug or XSS. If they offer some remuneration then no harm in going
ahead to confirm this one or may be finding more juicy stuff. I would prefer
to confirm vulnerabilities for our clients or some software products rather
offering free consulting services to irresponsible companies those deploy
insecure software and make their customers suffer...If you find any
vulnerability on the wild, no doubt report it in ethical way! But no reason
to spend time over it, where you don't have any personal or professional
interest!

Thanks for pointing out Plash.

It *seems* to be an exploitation.  I didnt have enough time to analyze it,
so I was hoping that someone from owasp delhi would confirm whether it is
an exploitation or not. "Print this page" link didnt work - it just showed
an alert box.  I would prefer to be reasonably sure that it is not a
programming issue.

What do other guys in the mailing list say? Report it right away or confirm
the issue and report it?

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] [Offtopic] National security [Mumbai Attacks] and not
	application security!!
Message-ID: <4931d3d5.034c6e0a.1575.ffffa7b4@mx.google.com>

I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
here with believe that you guys won't mind it!

 

Indian politicians are taking the civilians for granted and are very much
centric at their personal interests rather caring about interest of the
country. They are good at making unrealistic statements in media but no
action at all. I was in Delhi at the time of this attack on nation, but this
particular incident has really disturbed my deep feelings for my nation and
is giving so disheartening feeling of being an impotent and coward Indian
who can be killed anytime on the roads or in the suite of a 7 star hotel. No
one can enter and open up fire just like that in my home! I am 10000% sure,
the current heat will go on for few more days in Media and politicians will
be under pressure. But when it will come to action, it will be all hollow.
Honorable prime minister has blamed Pakistan for this, which is so lame and
highly irresponsible. My saying is, attackers can come from any part of the
world. Attackers have no face and no race, they are just terrorists. Who
cares, if they were trained in Pakistan or in America? Point is, are we
fully secured??? Country needs to think about its border security and then
internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong
intelligence network. Shameless politicians just can't wash off their hands
by blaming any other country and must understand that "We are weak from
inside-out". Look at United States, one attack and they just declared
openly, If any country is going to mess with us we will destroy it! But wow!
Welcome to India! We need more votes to win elections, bring reservation for
OBCs, Marathas rule Mumbai, divide our society on caste but we don't care
about the life of those OBCs, Marathas or people with different cast in our
country. I won't be surprised to see another attack in next few months in
Delhi and probably becoming a victim of it. It can just happen to anyone,
except politicians! And they know it very well that they are always going to
be safe due to high personal security. I don't see any GOD for these people
who just don't perform their duties for which they were elected by the
civilians. 

Regarding death sentence to terrorists, it is just not meant for terrorists,
coz death is not miserable. Death is much easier than living a miserable
life. There needs to be some miserable life for such evil people. Cut down
their sexual organ, tongue, hands, take out their eyes and let them live a
miserable life in their own country. I am so angry on the way politicians of
my country operate and couldn't really sleep from last 3 days or concentrate
on my work. May be, we are paying the cost for our sins to take birth in the
country that is always operated by incompetent and impotent politicians!
Probably, our politicians were never fed with their mother's breast milk and
must have been fed by some bitches on the street! That is why they have no
love for their nation! 

Indian politics is the top reason for taking our nation back! I see just a
single solution to terrorism in India: Terrorists should start targeting our
politicians...Kill every one, whose title ends with Minister....That can
bring a change and ours politicians might (I am still doubtful they will,
but I feel they might) act on terrorism then... 



 

Many Thanks,

Dhruv

If you meet any Indian politician, ask him to kill me. I don't want a death
from some terrorist in my own country!!!

Hi,

> I just wanted to share my opinion on something offtopic [MUMBAI ATTACKS]
> here with believe that you guys won't mind it!
Think 'holistic' approach to overall security which includes physical
world security, its not off-topic but relevant to this list. Your
information security professional caught in terrorist attack could
make your application in-secure. Its for a reason that datacenters are
supposed to have 3 meter steel reinforced concrete walls designed to
withstand nuclear attacks.

<SNIP-OUTBURST>
> Point is, are we fully secured???
Don't we know 'full security' is a mirage. Let us work in the spirit
of information security by discussing how the security circus is not
really making us secure.


Right from our education system our citizens learn one thing that
every system can be gamed given sufficient motivation. And that is
what we do in our lifetimes here in India. Game the system to prevent
it from getting you caught in it. The law abiding citizens can either
avoid dealing with the system or crack it to take additional
advantages over others. We even celebrate corporates that can subvert
the system better. Is this in-solvent system capable of protecting us.
Full-Disclosure and non-sensational discussion about the ills of
system and its communication in a feedback loop to the aspiring to be
elected representatives is a way we should go about it.

Examples :-
1. KYC norms for Telecom and Financial products: A chain is only as
strong as its weakest link. Can a terrorist not forge/obtain a genuine
passport and proof of address( lease agreement ). Even for a PAN
number the verification system provided to the Banks/financial
institutions only verifies whether a PAN is valid or not. The last
mile guy who looks at the photograph of yours on PAN card/any photo id
card has no way of knowing that the photo belongs to you. The web
applications for Tax Information Network are disjointed and prone to
variety of social engineering attacks. A simpler environment friendly
system based on digital certificates can be implemented as opposed to
making millions of people run around government departments in their
gas guzzling cars.


2. Airport security:
a) Why the X-Ray machines are deep into crowded areas. X-Ray machines
and security checks should be at the entrance of the airport itself.
Suppose someone just carries luggage full of explosives and explodes
it right at the X-Ray machine.

b) I am also reminded of the lackadaisical attitude at security staff
a few months back. When I complained about someone leaving his luggage
un-attended the guard told me the owner must have been gone to the
restroom and I needn't worry so much. Ofcourse it turned out to be
true the guy who left his luggage un-attended was back.
3. Is there something called an escalation matrix in place that the
whole security establishment is aware of. It is said that the people
responsible for making the request for the crack force took an
in-ordinate amount of time. It was the same during the Kandhar hijack.
The hijacked plane could have been detained at Amritsar Airport when
it stopped for re-fuelling. It doesn't matter which party's government
is in power. Our government establishment is composed of same
bureaucrats who only work in CYA mode and know only how to pass the
buck. A phone call to any phone number listed on NIC maintained
government sites for their departments would provide you with another
phone number and another in the worst show of buck passing until you
find someone amongst those 1% conscientious bureaucrats who are
actually running the whole show.

Lets document possible scenarios and use cases in true application
security style with full-disclosure of exploit codes for cracking the
system. Lets make the system not rest until it gets better at fixing
itself and absorbing more nuanced feedback produced by information
security forums like ours rather than periodical outbursts like our
maniacal mass media.

> internal security by adopting cutting-edge technology and building strong

The difference is a culture of security. In India that there is no
culture of secure thinking. Construction workers working without hard
hats, people in smaller towns not putting on seat belts while driving
in cars are all examples of an in-disciplined and un-educated
citizenry and reflect on enforcement agencies with a lack of will to
enforce the rules. This is further accentuated by well meaning but
counter-productive actions of politicians like our venerable Health
minister who want to load the law enforcement agencies with laws that
cannot be enforced without turning the country into a police state.

It is not the Indian politics but lack of interest and holier than
thou attitude of our educated classes. We cry hoarse when we hear
about cases/FIRs against our electoral candidates. Even while we know
that if one of us were to contest the elections then false FIRs would
be lodged against by opposing candidates stooges. Why do we hold our
politicians to different standards.
> Terrorists should start targeting our

Let us not wish for things we do not really wish to come true. Are you
saying that we would be happy that Rajiv Gandhi died at the hands of
terrorists.
> That can

The politician's biggest fault is not in-action but subverting the
system that is supposed to fight against the terrorists. The impotence
of Maharashtra's ruling coalition in preventing crimes against indian
citizens by language based separatists couldn't have been lost on the
terrorist thinktanks. Projecting an image of state power ( US style )
and rule of law ( see Broken Window Theory
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_Broken_Windows ) goes a long way
in dissuading potential local helpers in terror crimes.

>>Think 'holistic' approach to overall security which includes physical

Probably, the impact of this attack could have been reduced if our officials
would have kept an eagle eye on the CCTV capturing. No use to run those
captured footages after 189 people have lost their lives. Again negligence!
Organizational security can't be accomplished till the time, CEO of the
organization is not worried about it and same goes for the country...

>>Lets document possible scenarios and use cases in true application

system. 
You hit the nail right up on the head. I also had same stuff running in my
mind. Let me try to form a wiki for this but I am scared my friend that most
of the information might get used by the terrorists and no action will come
from our great national leaders. I was even thinking to shoot some videos to
show how easy it is to carry explosives from one part to another by carrying
some bag filled with rocks and stones and no security official is going to
check it.

>>Are you saying that we would be happy that Rajiv Gandhi died at the hands
of
terrorists.
Give me a single name that can be compared even as 10% to Rajiv Gandhi or
Indira Gandhi..I think their unfortunate assassination has made our
politicians cowards and they are scared of fighting with terrorism. Look at
Hemant Karkare, at 1AM he never thought of playing family-family. OR, giving
directions to his subordinates from his office room. He just came right on
the battle ground to show his leadership to his subordinates and motivate
them. phew! As usual we were unfortunate to loose yet another national hero.
But holly cow, his sacrifice to nation was tried to be compensated by Mr.
Modi for few bucks, who accused him sometime back. I am proud of Hemant's
wife who denied accepting that compensation. We need to accept that our
country's leadership from the top is badly struggling, their blood is too
cold, they are over aged and if they will try to get aggressive on fighting
with terrorism either they will get high blood pressure problem or will die
from heart attack. 

>>The impotence of Maharashtra's ruling coalition in preventing crimes
against indian
Citizens
Referring to our core exposure to information security. If you are
vulnerable, you will be exploited. We need to fight with vulnerabilities
rather fighting with various variants of exploits. I feel India is fighting
with terrorists and not with the terrorism. At this time they exploited the
vulnerability of Porbandar (Gujrat) and low security at different places, we
never made vulnerability assessment of our boarder and other places but were
ready with NSG, Army, Cops, ATS to fight with exploiters. Reactive Vs
Proactive!!! Cost of security assessment is much lower than fixing the
impact! We could learn from this example, be it information security or
national security. I just think if there would have 100-200 terrorists
spreaded over different prominent parts of the country what difference it
would have been made and how many lives our heroes and country would have
sacrificed! It happens only in India, my incredible India...

Hi dhruv,
rightly said.

they have already started advertising it on the 2nd day of the attack.
the terrorists are killing there in mumbai, and our superb politicians are
asking for votes in paper.
it is a bit shocking when i saw it in the paper.

and more shocking is that some of my friends are quite impressed with the ad
and openly supporting it.

we can never come close to us/uk/israel in terms of security, as we are
masters at building internals walls of religions/castes/regions
and always ready to hit the other with the left over bricks. the bricks just
started evolving into bombs.

i hope we will not end up like pakisthan/iraq throwing bombs at each other
and feeling proud of the crime committed.
