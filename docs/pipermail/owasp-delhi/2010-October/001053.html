<PRE>If I had to provide access to the enterprise portals to some of the people in my partner organization (external users), I need to authenticate them.

If my internal users are using Active Directory for authentication to the Enterprise Portals, will it be a good design to create external users in the AD and allow authentication to the portal?
Or one should go with doing custom authentication of the external users in Database and &quot;not touch&quot; Active Directory&quot;?
Or setup federated &quot;trust&quot; between organization Active Directory (assuming both have same Active Directory technology)?

My take is that Active Directory is the best product to manage user authentication and should be used for creating external users too.

Your thoughts please.

Thanks &amp; Regards,
