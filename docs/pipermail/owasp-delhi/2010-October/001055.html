Dear,

This is how we did. We did it through the AD. Devised a policy mechanism to first identify all external partners. Maybe you start with $ as a prefix and then follow your AD ID policy. Additionally federated trust will help if you want to devise a mechanism of Full, or partial access or segmented access.

AD has immense potential and decidedly does good as an authentication manager. However there is one issue and you have to be very cautious while purchasing NAS or SAN boxes. Check for compatibility with AD. On the distribution front, all 'A' class packages  talk with AD seamlessly. Hope this helps.

Subject: [Owasp-delhi] Is it a good design to put external users in Active Directory

If I had to provide access to the enterprise portals to some of the people in my partner organization (external users), I need to authenticate them.

If my internal users are using Active Directory for authentication to the Enterprise Portals, will it be a good design to create external users in the AD and allow authentication to the portal?
Or one should go with doing custom authentication of the external users in Database and &quot;not touch&quot; Active Directory&quot;?
Or setup federated &quot;trust&quot; between organization Active Directory (assuming both have same Active Directory technology)?

My take is that Active Directory is the best product to manage user authentication and should be used for creating external users too.

Your thoughts please.

Thanks &amp; Regards,
