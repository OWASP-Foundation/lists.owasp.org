Howdy,

On Saturday the 15th of October we will be hosting a Cyber Security Challenge: Capture the Flag Event.

Unfortunately the competition is only open to non cyber security professional and students, as its purpose is to try to get more talent into the area.
So if your work in IT or generally have an interest in security but don't officially work in it, then please send an email to:

universities at cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk or email me back directly

NOTE: Teams are made up of 4 people but if you are either an individual or don't quite make a 4 still email your details and we will make the teams up to 4's.

Here is the official blurb and here is a link to the poster - https://digi.ninja/files/cyberchallengeposter.pdf

"Sheffield Hallam, The Cyber Security Challenge and Raytheon, will be hosting a CTF event on Saturday the 15th of October.

We invite teams of up to 4 individuals to enter a jeopardy style CTF, so come along, have some fun, develop your skills and meet other like minded people.

Hi all,

Apologies for the late notice, but we've had to change the date for the
next event.

It will now take place on Wednesday 30th November, still at MediaCityUK.

We'll be looking for speakers for the newly arranged event - so as before,
if anyone wants to talk just get in touch with myself or one of the other
chapter leaders.

Thanks, and again, sorry for the late notice.

Regards,

Daniel

On behalf of the OWASP Manchester Chapter Leaders
