Hi all,

We are planning on having an OWASP Manchester Social on Wednesday 20th May
(for those not lucky enough to be going to AppSec EU!).

The plan is to meet at the Rain Bar (80 Great Bridgewater Street,
rain-bar.co.uk for more details) at 7:30pm and then just go with the
consensus until everyone has had enough! :)

All being well, we hope to meet up with Samy Kamkar later in the evening (
samy.pl -- the man behind the Samy MySpace worm) who'll be in Manchester
speaking at TMRW (www.tmrwconf.org, which is part of IP Expo Manchester).

Hope you can all make it!

Regards,

Daniel

(On behalf of the Manchester Chapter Leaders)

P.S. We will also be announcing the date and venue for the next OWASP
Manchester meeting shortly.

Hi All,



The next OWASP Manchester meeting will be at 6pm on Wednesday 15th June at
UK Fast's offices in Hulme [1]. UKFast will be sponsoring the venue and
bar. NCC Group will sponsor the pizza.



*We are still seeking speakers for this event. *We have one speaker so far
and want more - please email stuartw1 at gmail.com with a brief outline of
what you want to speak about. It doesn't have to be web-app related
(anything to do with IT security will be fine) but presentations around
web-apps will generally get priority.



A more detailed agenda including speakers will be sent out in the next few
weeks.



The first wave of 100 tickets will be released around 12pm midday on Friday
15th May. A link to the eventbrite page will be sent out immediately
before. A smaller wave will follow closer to the event for anyone who
missed out.



Many thanks,



Stuart
