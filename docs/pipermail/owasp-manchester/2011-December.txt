Hi folks,

I've finally uploaded the slides from the last event - apologies for taking
so long, entirely my fault!

They are linked off here:

Thanks again to Danny and Gareth for the great talks.

The next event will be on Wednesday 1st Feb 2012, summary here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester more details to follow...

We already have 2 talks lined up, and hope to have a third.
If that happens then the event will be from 6pm - 9pm.

Please get in touch if you would like to speak at this or any of of the
other Manchester events.

Cheers,

Simon Bennetts
