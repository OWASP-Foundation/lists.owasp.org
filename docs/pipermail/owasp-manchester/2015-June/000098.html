<PRE>Hello everyone,

I would like to start in Manchester OWASP reading group. Basic idea would
be that if anyone reads a book, some substantial paper or a report he could
make a presentation about what he/she had read and knowledge he/she gained
and transfer the knowledge to other members of OWASP community. After to
presentation we could discussed the covered topics and possibly make some
critic on the book (like what was explained good, what are the holes).
Basically it could be any security related book or work, from certification
study guides to books about malware, forensics, various attacks, defenses,
etc. It could be from basics to advanced topic in security. The frequency
of the meeting is probably dependent on people reading and willing to
present. But I would hope we will be able to make one gathering in each
month, or every two months.

I hope you'd like the idea. First thing would I would like to hear from you
is whether someone read some interesting book recently and is willing to
tell us about? Afterwards we will set the time and venue for the first
meeting.

Also, to mention, this will not interfere in anyway to regular OWASP
Manchester meetings. It is quite different concept and I would see it as
more rookie thing where anyone can present about a book or paper he/she
read recently.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
Nikola Milo&#353;evi&#263;
