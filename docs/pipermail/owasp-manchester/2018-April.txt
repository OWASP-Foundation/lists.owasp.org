Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Next event - call for speakers
Message-ID: <CAJWAiW4VAyCMFMAXhjs2K3g1WA8WCWp3bYqSxO2nCurB9xdDEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

We will be having our next event most likely on the 3rd of May at the
University Place on Oxford Road. We are finalizing organisation of the
event, however, we have a request for all willing to speak at the event.

We are still looking for one or two speakers for the event. We wanted to
make some career oriented event, so if you are involved in hiring process
or head hunting security professionals or you have spend a lots of years in
security fields and you think your career had interesting turns that other
would like to hear about, please let me know. We have one speaker on the
topic, but looking for additional one or two.

Also, we are happy to host one normal talk or rookie talk. So if you have
any new research that you would like to present, also let me know.

I know it is a bit of a short notice, but we would really appreciate if
people can help us with additional presentations and contribute to
successful event after a longer break.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Nikola Milo?evi?
OWASP Manchester local chapter leader

Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Next OWASP meeting - 3.5.2018 University Place
Message-ID: <CAJWAiW5HTwwvWg3ijsD9sGmnuVqe4YEA3R9-kpkUQpn3LHro9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

As I have already announced the next chapter meeting will be next Thursday
(03.05.2018) at the University place (room 1.218), on Oxford road (M13 9PL
).

Please register here for the event:
https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-chapter-meeting-tickets-45532107760

We're starting with something those of us 'in' the industry may take for
granted - how to get started in Information Security/Cyber
Security/Breaking Stuff as a Service/Fixing as a Service. We've lined up
two speakers who you may know, but you may not know how they found their
feet in the industry:

Daniel Dresner (@danielgdresner) is starting us off with his experiences of
pragmatically addressing risk across his career to date from industry and
academia. And possibly why bow ties matter.

John Denneny of Pentest Limited will be speaking to how he's seen his
career and role change in starting up a firm. Those of you with an
entrepreneurial spirit take notes....John knows what it takes to build your
own career and a ?10m business around it.

QA will be after each speaker due to scheduling commitments. Also, the
event will be accompanied with some snacks and beers.

Hope to see you there.
