<PRE>Hi all,

Firstly on behalf of the Chapter Leaders I'd like to thank all of the
sponsors, speakers and attendees of this year's OWASP Manchester events -
we hope you all enjoyed them!

For 2017 we are planning on doing four main events - the first of which is
on *January 26th* as already announced (tickets will be made available in
about two weeks time - watch this space for details!). *We're still looking
for speakers and sponsors for this and future events, so if you've had any
great ideas over a mince pie this Christmas we'd be keen to hear from you.*

As a reminder: our OWASP Chapter events mainly focus on 3 tracks:

 - Builders
 - Breakers
 - Defenders

As a guideline we invite talks on the following topics (not exhaustive
list):

  * Novel web/mobile vulnerabilities and countermeasures (note: no
zero-days, any vulnerabilities must be responsibly disclosed prior to
presenting at OWASP events)
  * New technologies, paradigms, frameworks, tools
  * OWASP tools or projects - new and existing, best practices and
experience of implementing them in your company
  * Agile Security and Continuous Integration
  * Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, methods,
processes, standards, SDLC, code review
  * AppSec Pipeline - Automation and Orchestration
  * Threat modelling
  * AI and Machine Learning in Application Security
  * Browser security
  * IoT security and AppSec
  * JavaScript/Node.JS security
  * Mobile security and security for the mobile web
  * Threat Intelligence &amp; AppSec
  * Cloud security, Container security
  * REST/SOAP and API security
  * Security of frameworks
  * Payment Security, PCI impact on AppSec, tools, frameworks, best
practices
  * Blockchain &amp; AppSecurity
  * Cryptography and its use (and abuse) in Mobile and Web Apps
  * Data Privacy, Governance
  * Management topics: Managing Secure Software Development LifeCycle
(SDLC), Managing Application Security initiatives, Developer Training

Recommended talk duration is 30 to 45 minutes with additional 15 minutes
for any live demos and Q&amp;A.

If you would like to present a talk at future OWASP Manchester Chapter
meetings please review and agree with the OWASP Speaker Agreement here:

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement</A>

And then get in touch with any of the Chapter leaders either via this list
or directly.

Here's to a great 2017 and hope to see you at an event soon!

Regards,

Daniel
On behalf of the OWASP Manchester Chapter leaders
