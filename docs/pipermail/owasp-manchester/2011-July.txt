Subject: [Owasp-manchester] 2011 OWASP Manchester meeting dates
Message-ID: <CAORxfg4++OZbZOsz1h8JQsvdbjM7QMACV73aPG_atfE3oc659Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, and welcome to the OWASP Manchester mailing list!

We are planning 2 chapter meetings in 2011 on August 24th and November 16th.

I've already got some talks lined up for both dates, but there are still
more slots available, so please get in touch if you or anyone you know would
like to speak at one of these meetings.

And if you have any requests for talks then please email this list - we'll
do our best to find someone who can talk about any security topic you are
interested in.

For more details see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester, and I will
(of course) keep you updated via this list.

Many  thanks,

Simon Bennetts
OWASP Manchester chapter leader
OWASP ZAP project lead

Just a quick note to say that I've restructured the Manchester home page:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester

Hopefully the tabs make it a bit clearer. At least I think so - let me know
if you disagree ;)

The only real change is the organisations tab.
This is for links to related organisations in the Manchester area - we
should all be helping each other out!
I've added a link to the BCS site - let me know if there are any others I
should add.

And (as mentioned on the page) feel free to use this list to publicise
related events run by other organisations.

Cheers,

Simon

Looks good. A couple of suggestions:

Change ?2011 Meetings? to ?Upcoming Events?.

Change ?Manchester? to ?Next Meeting?, move the sentence about
Manchester and Leeds to the section at the top. If we manage to make the
blurb bigger we can have an Introduction tab.

I?ve added: GeekUp, which isn?t just Manchester but has a regular
Manchester meeting, and is where you?re likely to find web developers;
North West Digital Communities, which is a kind of meta group for
coordinating regional events, and I am part of through other groups, so
will represent the OWASP Manchester Chapter on it.

I haven?t added Manchester Free Software and ManLUG, because I?m not
sure how ?related? they are, and I am also involved with them. If you
think they should be added, please do. :)

Good suggestions :)
Made those changes and shifted the Leaders tab to the right to give more of
a focus to the events.
Does it look ok now?

And I've added links to Manchester Free Software, ManLUG and MadLab - theyre
all software related, and the more we publicize each others events the
better in my book :)

Cheers,

Simon

I changed the MFS URI to point to the preferred location on the Libre
Planet wiki.

Message-ID: <CAAxdBB=DTSa5jh9hcNgjy_JNcGgj9BOVhtCuKmNHJ+YB80ir4Q@mail.gmail.com>

(Cross-post to all 4 UK chapter lists)

The Commons Select Committee has decided to gather evidence on the
impact of malware on individuals, the responsibilities of Government
to aid in preventing malware infections and the economy that has grown
up around this industry.

http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/110719-new-inquiry---malware/

 The focus is on user protection.

 1. Should OWASP make a submission?

 2. Does anyone have time to draft a submission?

 The deadline is noon on Wednesday 7 September 2011.  Interestingly
responses need to be sent by email with "Malware" as the subject line.

 Colin
