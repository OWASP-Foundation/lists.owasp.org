Subject: [Owasp-manchester] .UK domain name "security"
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBkw9aB1obOU0t1QN9G6Ln4V9H4f6d60UHWSxUB=uoemOg@mail.gmail.com>

(Cross-posted to UK lists)

 Nominet is requesting responses to a consultation on proposals for new
 second-level .uk domains. Regardless of the merits of that idea, I
 wondered if UK OWASPers wanted to submit a response to the security
 ideas proposed? Apart from registrant identity verification, the
 security ideas are currently:

  * routine monitoring of domains for malware and viruses on the domain name
  * include a visible trust mark to indicate this enhanced security to
 customers of the domain,
  * include mandatory DNSSEC signing

 It would seem OWASP ought to be able to suggest improvements to these.
 The consultation document is:

 The closing date for responses is 7th January 2013. I think the
 response should be kept fairly short, and only answer the most
 OWASP-relevant items (i.e. not whether we think it is a good idea at
 all!). I tried to get some input via the London list and have created
 an initial draft here:

 If anyone has any thoughts, suggestions or improvements, please let me know.

 You can of course reply to the consultation independently as well.
