Message-ID: <CACn--+Coq1S3+mGaBW3nP3qQ_KVj9cbJgEBXuRGe4tDHrYaSHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Firstly on behalf of the Chapter Leaders I'd like to thank all of the
sponsors, speakers and attendees of this year's OWASP Manchester events -
we hope you all enjoyed them!

For 2017 we are planning on doing four main events - the first of which is
on *January 26th* as already announced (tickets will be made available in
about two weeks time - watch this space for details!). *We're still looking
for speakers and sponsors for this and future events, so if you've had any
great ideas over a mince pie this Christmas we'd be keen to hear from you.*

As a reminder: our OWASP Chapter events mainly focus on 3 tracks:

 - Builders
 - Breakers
 - Defenders

As a guideline we invite talks on the following topics (not exhaustive
list):

  * Novel web/mobile vulnerabilities and countermeasures (note: no
zero-days, any vulnerabilities must be responsibly disclosed prior to
presenting at OWASP events)
  * New technologies, paradigms, frameworks, tools
  * OWASP tools or projects - new and existing, best practices and
experience of implementing them in your company
  * Agile Security and Continuous Integration
  * Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, methods,
processes, standards, SDLC, code review
  * AppSec Pipeline - Automation and Orchestration
  * Threat modelling
  * AI and Machine Learning in Application Security
  * Browser security
  * IoT security and AppSec
  * JavaScript/Node.JS security
  * Mobile security and security for the mobile web
  * Threat Intelligence & AppSec
  * Cloud security, Container security
  * REST/SOAP and API security
  * Security of frameworks
  * Payment Security, PCI impact on AppSec, tools, frameworks, best
practices
  * Blockchain & AppSecurity
  * Cryptography and its use (and abuse) in Mobile and Web Apps
  * Data Privacy, Governance
  * Management topics: Managing Secure Software Development LifeCycle
(SDLC), Managing Application Security initiatives, Developer Training

Recommended talk duration is 30 to 45 minutes with additional 15 minutes
for any live demos and Q&A.

If you would like to present a talk at future OWASP Manchester Chapter
meetings please review and agree with the OWASP Speaker Agreement here:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement

And then get in touch with any of the Chapter leaders either via this list
or directly.

Here's to a great 2017 and hope to see you at an event soon!

Regards,

Daniel

Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Chapter Meeting - Thursday 26th
Message-ID: <CACn--+BWSnPEVANdmu57oE4B99AH03EqDZENM9VWhFmsqRJ=bg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Just a quick reminder that we're still looking for speakers and pizza
sponsors for our next event on Thursday 26th January. Please get in touch
with one of the chapter leaders if you can help with either! (We're a very
friendly crowd! :))

Note that we do have a limited amount of funds available to cover travel
expenses; so if there's someone you think we should invite over to
Manchester let us know and we'll see what we can organise.

We'd also love to hear from anyone who'd be interested in hosting a future
OWASP Manchester event. So if you think you might be able to help (or know
someone who can) again, just contact any of the chapter leaders.

Regards,
Daniel

Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Thursday's Event
Message-ID: <CACn--+CbaKU9hijQxB=7tLpD3pDu+UzvULkZmxLbfFGN+f_fqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Unfortunately we've had to cancel Thursday's event due to a lack of
available speakers.

Our next event will be in late April (we'll announce the date within the
next 48 hours) - so if you know anyone who might like to speak at that
(remember, we can cover travel expenses where necessary) please let us
know.

Apologies for the late notice.

Regards,
Daniel

Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Next OWASP Manchester Event - Wednesday 26th
	April
Message-ID: <CACn--+CSZ5ZRM4uq3WWuhb+Yih=1-x+T-UMwAqVnPWoUL6NYfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Just advance notice that the next OWASP Manchester Chapter event will be
taking place on the evening of *Wednesday 26th April*. This event will be
kindly hosted by *ThoughtWorks* at their City Tower offices in the centre
of Manchester.

As always we'd love to hear from you if you'd be interested in either
speaking at this or a future OWASP Manchester event, if you'd like to
suggest a speaker (remember we can cover reasonable travel expenses), if
you'd like to host a future event or if your organisation can sponsor beer
or pizza.

Ideally we'd like one more speaker for the event in April, so if you've got
something that you think may be of interest to the Chapter just let us know!

Regards,

Daniel
