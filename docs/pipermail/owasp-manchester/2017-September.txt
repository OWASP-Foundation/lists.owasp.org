Hi All,

Firstly apologies for the failure to run a few of the promised Chapter
meetings this year - as you'll be aware we had some issues.

To try and avoid missing meetings in the future and also to try and make
sure we're providing what the membership would like to see, we've setup an
online suggestion box (at the moment in the form of a shared Google Doc -
if you've got a better idea for hosting this I'd be interested to hear your
suggestions!):

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M949QoBaefW0t8F56dtbVr_VBTWGzeMnjXWjiEFc4Xs/edit?usp=sharing

If you get a chance, please can you have a look and vote for the
suggestions you like and add any additional ideas you think might be of
interest to the group.

Also, as always, we'd be interested in hearing from anyone who'd like to
speak at or sponsor our next Chapter meeting (likely to take place in
November) - if you'd like to get involved or would like to suggest anyone
please just let us know!

Thanks,
Daniel

Hi all,

Just a reminder for those that haven't already had a look - the OWASP
Manchester Suggestion box is available here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M949QoBaefW0t8F56dtbVr_
VBTWGzeMnjXWjiEFc4Xs/edit?usp=sharing

We're looking for your ideas and feedback on the events you'd like us to
run over the coming 12 months.

We'll leave the current version up until the end of this month.

Thanks,

Daniel on behalf of
OWASP Manchester Chapter Leaders
