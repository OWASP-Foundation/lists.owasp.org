Subject: [Owasp-manchester] OWASP Manchester - new leaders needed!
Message-ID: <CAORxfg4tpdMFZsJ2AaAyQ-GXJuqHW1=kyabD-rv+3ZzFbF7MFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'm afraid we're struggling to arrange OWASP Manchester chapter meetings
due to too many other commitments :(
Anyone on this list feel able to help out?
Getting people to speak isnt a problem, nor is finding locations.
Its just all of the admin stuff that takes time.
So you dont have to be a "security expert" to set these things up, but it
_is_ a great way to get to know people in the industry.

Any volunteers??

Many thanks,

Simon
