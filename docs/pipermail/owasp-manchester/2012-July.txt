Forwarding to the Manchester list, as we're the closest chapter to
Liverpool :)

I thought some of you guys would be interested in this.

BREAKERFAIRE ? COMMUNITY DRIVEN SECURITY EVENT IN LIVERPOOL
Breakerfaire ? Noun ? Singular

A shameless pun on Makerfaire which will undoubtedly result in me being
sent a cease and desist for blatant trademark infringement.
A community driven security conference in Liverpool, England, held monthly
at DoesLiverpool.
So, yeah. I?ve decided to run a regular security meetup, and the chaps at
DoesLiverpool have been foolish kind enough to host it. Now, you may be
wondering why you should bother when you have OWASP  Leeds and OWASP
Birmingham within spitting distance*. Well, here?s a good few reasons why.

DoesLiverpool is full of genuinely nice, smart people.
It?ll have some amazing talks from members of the community, as well as
respected security professionals who are at the top of their game.
The venue is as central as you can possibly be, and within walkiing
distance of some of the best bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants Liverpool
has to offer.
The venue has lasers. Does OWASP have lasers? No. Enough said.
Talks will be about the entire spectrum of security, from secure
development, to web application hacking to network security.
Dude. Lasers!
If you?re convinced, the inaugural session is on the 17th of July, and
willl be held on the third tuesday of each month. Any questions, just pop
me an email or send me a tweet.

* Spitting distance provided that you are able to project saliva with the
force of an artillery cannon.

Might be worth dropping the guys at oreilly a note to see if we could use te name breakerfaire!  Could be a bside to makerfaire.  Although. Makerfaire is kinda a hacker event.
