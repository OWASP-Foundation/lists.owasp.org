Hi All,

First of all thanks to everyone who attended the last OWASP Manchester
Chapter event - hope everyone enjoyed it!

After a few requests, Tim Fletcher has very kindly put the slides for his
talk on OpenSSH Certificate Authorities online:

Our next event has now been confirmed for *Thursday 3rd August* at *UKFast*.
Tickets will be available via EventBrite as usual a couple of weeks before
the event.

We're looking for *speakers* and *sponsors* for this event - so if anyone
has anything they'd like to talk about or would like to provide beer and/or
pizza for the event just let me or one of the other Chapter Leaders know.

Thanks,
Daniel
