Hi All,

Tickets are now available for the next Chapter meeting on 26th April via
Event Brite:

https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-chapter-meeting-26th-april-2017-tickets-31810381708

We have two confirmed speakers so-far - Alex Haynes who'll be talking about
vulnerability disclosure, bug bounty programs and life as a security
researcher. We also have Tim Fletcher who'll be talking about how to manage
and administer OpenSSH certificates without it taking over your life! We
hope to be able to announce a third speaker shortly.

(Of course, if you're interested in being that third speaker - drop one of
the chapter leaders and email - we'd be very pleased to hear from you!)

More details can be found on the Event Brite page and on the OWASP
Manchester Wiki Page.

Regards,
Daniel
