We've got 2 great talks lined up:

*Talk: BYOD Could You Would You Should You - Mobile Device Management for
BYOD*

This presentation discusses the current trend of adopting some form of BYOD
policy and the security implications in doing so. Also discussed are the
options avalible to help mitigate some of the risks associated with
allowing personal mobile devices to access corporate data

*Speaker: Ben Ramduny - KPMG*


*Talk: Building a secure SDLC utilising OWASP resources*

In this presentaion Jason will show how the free and open resources of
OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) can be utilised to initially
measure the current status and maturity of security within your software
development life cycle and then drive improvements at every stage. From
setting security requirements and implementing standards to developer
training, software testing and all importantly measuring results.

*Speaker: Jason Alexander - Security Architect - KPMG *
And we've also got an open mic session - talk about any security topic you
like for up to 5 mins.

Hope to see you there :)

Simon
