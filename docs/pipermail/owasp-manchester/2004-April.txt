I've got some good news, and some bad news.

The good news is that this Wednesday's event has sold out!
And, of course, the bad news (if you havnt already booked on it) is that
this Wednesday's event has sold out...

I'll see if we can make some more places available, but if (for any reason)
you find out that you now cant make it then please let me know.
And if you want to attend but havnt got a ticket yet then also let me know.

Cheers,

Simon

I have set up a OWASP Manchester Group on Linkedin.  
We will also be using it to keep everybody updated on meetings, talkers bios and general OWASP news.

Please show your support by joining the group and to post any App Sec discussions on there.

See you all on Wednesday!

Thanks Andy!

Just a reminder to everyone that tomorrows event is now fully booked, so if
you cant now make it then please let me know as there are people on the
waiting list.

And we havnt managed to find anyone to sponsor pizzas this time I'm afraid
:(
If you can sponsor the pizza then please let me know asap, otherwise best
have something to eat before, or plan for a late dinner.

Look forward to seeing you all tomorrow!

Cheers,

Simon
