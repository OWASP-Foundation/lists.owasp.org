Subject: [Owasp-manchester] OWASP East Midlands - First meeting (help
	needed!)
Message-ID: <CAGamWwbNOxjAoAiAMGfVPyVjMDu=KB0aHhKi9wZf2tgec9RiZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We will be holding our first meeting of OWASP East Midlands on April 25th.

The University of Derby have kindly agreed to host at their Kedleston Road
campus (we're hijacking one of their DISC sessions). We have one talk liked
up for the evening but we'd really like another; ideally a short "Welcome
to OWASP" type talk, ideally from someone heavily involved in an existing
chapter. Can anyone help us out here?

Please let Jamie Shaw or myself know if you're able to help.

If you'd like to come, please let the University know by booking in here
(the talk subject is wrong; don't worry about this):
http://www.derby.ac.uk/computing/disc/booking

I look forward to seeing some of you there.

Kind regards,

Mark Goodwin
