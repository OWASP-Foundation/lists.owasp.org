Hi folks,

Are you (or do you know) a student who would like to get paid to work
on an OWASP project over the summer?

Please see the attached email and documents from Fabio.

I think this is a great opportunity, both for OWASP and students
interested in appsec!

Please spread the word!

Cheers,

Simon

Dear all,

I'm delighted to inform you that OWASP has been accepted as GSOC
mentoring organization for 2012.

Until March 26th, would-be student participants will start approaching
OWASP to discuss application ideas.

You could find some GSOC Ideas suggested by OWASP project leaders here:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC2012_Ideas

>From March 26th and until April 6th, the official student application
period will open and proposals are received.

I've setup a mailing list specifically for OWASP GSOC that everyone is
invited to join: gsoc at lists.owasp.org

On that list, students will discuss their proposals for OWASP projects
and engage with mentors.

The current list of GSOC 2012 Mentors are:
Simon Bennetts
Skyler Onken
Chris Schmidt
Arshan Dabirsiaghi
Ryan Barnett
John Melton
Fabio Cerullo

The GSOC 2012 Administrators are:
Fabio Cerullo
Jason Li

A BIG thanks goes to the OWASP leaders who helped us get this far.

Regards,

Fabio
