Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Building PHP Applications on Windows Azure
Message-ID: <9BF2EC6593536C44A3F36B512779C62B189EE821@DBXPRD0610MB394.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

On Thursday August 30th from 6pm to 8pm Cory Fowler, Windows Azure Technical Evangelist from Microsoft, will be flying in from Redmond to demonstrate developing PHP Applications from Command-line to the Azure Cloud. He will outline the different deployment patterns in Windows Azure, as well as how to leverage several building block services offered by the platform for use in your PHP applications. This will all be done from his Mac :)

For anyone who hasn't seen the new Open Source features of Azure it will be really interesting to see the possibilities the platform now opens up. The event is free to attend and will be held at Madlab (with drinks afterwards in Common) and the sign up page is here:

Many Thanks,

Carlos

hi there,

The OWASP Vicnum Project is an open source project that helps you test
your knowledge on web application security. The AppSec Ireland 2012
challenge is to see if you can 'union' the two Vicnum games, Guessnum
and Jotto, using the same browser as I have used.

Players that solve the challenge should contact ireland at owasp.org

The competition will run until Friday 31st August.

Once the competition is over, the first three winners will get a FREE
ticket to the conference.

http://vicnum.ciphertechs.com/appsec2012.html

Please be aware the use of ?scripts?, ?brute force? or any other
automated or programmed means, will inmediately void any prize award
and the participant will be refused further participation.

A big thanks goes to Mordecai and the Ciphertechs team for setting up
this challenge.

Best of luck everyone!

Regards,

Fabio
