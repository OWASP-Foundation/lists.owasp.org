Subject: [Owasp-manchester] OWASP Manchester Spring 2013 meeting
Message-ID: <CAORxfg4xkSQ1N1jh8ZDWmBbMR=fcJtiP4q9F-c=D77+FjiWS0Q@mail.gmail.com>

As many of you have pointed out, we havnt had a meeting in a while!
There have been a few emails flying around between the chapter leaders, but
we've decided we should move the discussions onto the Manchester linkedin
group <http://www.linkedin.com/groups/OWASP-Manchester-4053065> so that
anyone can join in.

So if you can host the event, would like to speak or are interested in
contributing to this discussion in any way then please head over to
http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Spring-2013-meeting-4053065.S.220142469

We'll announce full details of the meeting on this list when they are
finalised.

Cheers,

Simon
