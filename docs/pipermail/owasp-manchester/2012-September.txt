Just over a week to go, but theres still time to book on this event.

Note that the website and Eventbrite pages gave different start times.

The website was right - the doors open at 18:00 and the talks start at
18:30 (I've corrected the event).

Apologies for any confusion - that was my fault ;)

44Con 2012

44Con 2012 will be held at the Millennium Gloucester Conference Centre in
Kensington from the 5th ? 7th September 2012. Two days of separate training
will take place on the 3rd and 4th of September 2012. The 5th of September
is a special Fast Track Day for busy people unable to take the full 3 days
off as well as students looking to become the information security experts
of tomorrow. The fast track day features an Infosec track and turbo talks
from speakers providing background to the research to be released over the
remaining two days. This is in addition to two workshop tracks and the
networking area. The 6th and 7th of September are reserved for a pure
technical security conference with no Infosec track and are ideally suited
for technical analysts unable to take the full 3 days away from work to
attend.

Subject: [Owasp-manchester] OWASP Manchester 11th Sept -- CHANGE OF TALKS --
Message-ID: <CAORxfg6BS5zs+B44MdSVwknu0CXa3G_RGLDC2kY5+yDt1dH0jQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'm afraid that due to unforeseen circumstances we've had to change one of
the talks for next Tuesday.

The talk on Defensive techniques and abusive web requests has been replaced
by a talk on the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy, given by my (the project lead).
Campbell Murray's talk on MySQL will go ahead in a slightly expanded form
and he's promised to give us a 10 minute summary of his experiences at this
years #44con.

Sorry about that.

Simon
