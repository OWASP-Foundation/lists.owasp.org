Subject: [Owasp-manchester] New OWASP meeting at 17th March
Message-ID: <CAJWAiW4xe7v86h+rYTBWhhdfjO-etjif3fWiM8RgHQcM8tWBpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

We will have a new OWASP meeting at 17th March 2016, starting at 18:00 in
SpacePortX, Manchester. So far we have one talk by Scott Helme. The
abstract of his talk is:


Turning over a new Leaf ? How the world?s bestselling electric car, the
Nissan Leaf can be accessed remotely to activate the climate control and
spy on details of the driver?s journeys simply by knowing or guessing the
VIN of the vehicle. This may seem like a harmless prank but could be used
to void warranties or drain batteries remotely, with Nissan looking to add
GPS tracking to the vehicles this issue could have become a whole lot worse.

You can book your tickets at
https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-meeting-17th-march-tickets-22527547501

We are still looking for presenters. If you would like to present or you
know someone who can prepare presentation (or already have ready one) for
17th, please let us know, since we would love to hear from you.

Best regards,
Nikola Milo?evi?

Hi, I've just joined this group.  Interested in an entry level training course on security testing in the Manchester area - does anyone have any particular recommendations?
Thanks

Hi Lisa,

That will probably depend on what type of security testing, what you hope
to learn  / get out of it and what your background is. For instance, what
you would suggest to someone with lots of IT / software development
experience or a computer science or electronic engineering background would
be quite different from someone who is looking to move from a different
industry or has just left school.

For general entry level stuff I would personally recommend free on-line
courses rather than physical ones (as you can learn little useful stuff in
a short period of time that would justify the course fee imho) unless you
require attendance certificates or CPE credits for your employer or some
sort of standards organisation. Or attempting some distance learning first
may mean that you turn up at a  course more prepared. Coursera, Edex or
Udacity may be a good place to start (see
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cyber-security) or just browse
youtube for courses.

Alternatively you could read some introductory books. Web application
hackers handbook
http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook/dp/8126533404/
and Network Security assessment
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Network-Security-Assessment-Know-Your/dp/149191095X/
were the first two I read and provide a good introduction. If you were
looking at code review or cryptography review (due to having suitable
development or mathematics experience in those areas) rather than web
application or network testing there would be other books I would recommend.

Other people may have completely different opinions from me though, or have
been on a course that was worthwhile and they would recommend.

Hope this helps

Cheers

Stuart

Thanks for all the ideas - I will certainly get hold of the books and am looking at the coursera course.  Does anyone know of anyone who might run an in-house workshop or short on-site course please?  We have a mixture - one tester with a master's degree and others with varying degrees of practical testing experience.

Hi Lisa,

I know NCC run courses - both public, and private. Others probably do, too. I've never been on an NCC course, so I can't really recommend them from that perspective, but I'm usually impressed with their other offerings.

Red Tiger Security from the USA are excellent (but expensive). They ran something on hacking Industrial Control Systems which I attended a while back.
