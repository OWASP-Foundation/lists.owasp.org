<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-meeting-12th-november-2015-tickets-19093911403">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-meeting-12th-november-2015-tickets-19093911403</A>

Current talks are:

*Scott Helme*
*Abstract:* Modern browsers have introduced new security features that
websites can activate using server headers: CSP, HSTS and HPKP. I analysed
the use of these headers on the Alexa Top 1 Million sites. The results are
not what you might expect and the data shows some interesting trends.

*Speaker bio:* Scott Helme is an Information Security Consultant who blogs
about security, privacy and performance online. He develops tools and
tutorials to help you deploy the latest web security features. Read more at

*Nikola Milosevic*
*Abstract:* Android users face many threats and risks. Since modern mobile
devices are almost all the time exposed to the internet and other types of
mobile networks, they are always exposed to the attacks. Users are usually
not aware of the threats. OWASP Seraphimdroid is an OWASP project
initiative with an aim to protect users from the threats by giving them the
right tools in the form of mobile application and to educate them trough
it. In this talk Nikola will present the current state and some interesting
features of OWASP Seraphimdroid.

*Speaker bio:* Nikola is a project leader of OWASP Seraphimdroid project
and one of the chapter leaders in Manchester. Previously, he founded and
led OWASP local chapter in Serbia in 2012. At the moment he is doing his
PhD at the University of Manchester. Read more at <A HREF="http://inspiratron.org/">http://inspiratron.org/</A>

presentation at the next meeting, please contact me at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-manchester">nikola.milosevic86 at gmail.com.</A> I will update you all, when we have new
speaker confirmed.

A lightning talk session may also be held if there is time to spare. There
will also be some time for networking.



Best regards,
Nikola Milo&#353;evi&#263;
