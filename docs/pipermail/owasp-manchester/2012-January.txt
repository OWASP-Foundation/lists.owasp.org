Pleased to say that tickets for this event are going quickly!

In a bit of blatant self promotion, I'd like to point out that the OWASP
Zed Attack Proxy (aka ZAP, which I project lead) is in the running for the
Toolsmith Tool of the year:

If you like ZAP then please vote for it :)

Cheers,

Simon

Hi folks,

All of the 60 places initially allocated for this event have been taken!
We've been able to make another 10 places available, but those are going
fast too.
So if you want to come alone then please book asap

And if you have booked but now cant make it then please let me know and
I'll release your ticket so someone else can use it.

And finally, a couple of people have suggested videoing the event - any
volunteers??

Cheers,

Simon
