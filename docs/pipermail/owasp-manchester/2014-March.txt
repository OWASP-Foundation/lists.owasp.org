Want to get a bit more involved in an OWASP project?
GSoC is a great initiative, and we need more OWASP mentors!
I've been a mentor for the last couple of years, and I've found it really
rewarding.

If you're interested then please get in touch - you dont have to be an
expert on a specific project, just have a desire to learn and help.

Cheers,

Simon

Dear OWASP Members,

As some of you are likely aware, OWASP has partnered with Google Summer of
Code (GSoC), to offer Mentor services to their approved applicants, on
current OWASP projects. GSoC
FAQ<http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page>Our
Blog
post<http://owasp.blogspot.com/2014/03/owasp-selectedas-officialgooglesummerof.html>for
more reference. We currently have 88 student applicants and only 20
mentors signed-up. As a general rule, Google assigns two mentors to each
student, to allow for scheduling flexibility and timing issues.

Last year, we had 11 students based on 22 Mentors through OWASP. This year,
we'd like to see that number at least double. Please put out a Call for
Mentors to your chapter members. Time is of the essence. The application
process has closed and Google is waiting to hear back from us, as to how
many mentors we have to offer them.

Dr. Konstantinos Papapanagiotou <Konstantinos at owasp.org> is heading up this
project, so if you have members that are of the mind to mentor, please put
them directly in contact with him and he can get them set-up with more
information and instructions on how to proceed from here.


Cheers and Happy Mentoring!
