Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Silk Road talk repeat - at the Pentest Lounge
Message-ID: <5190B4B2.8000208@pentest.co.uk>

Hi,

If you missed the Silk Road talk, or just want to see it again, you have
another chance to see it this week. I'm repeating it at the Pentest
Lounge this Thursday, in Altrincham, at 6pm.

The event is primarily for Pentest clients, but we are opening up this
month to the wider security community. If you want to come, please reply
to me by email. I will add you to the guest list, and respond with the
full location details.

Best wishes,

Paul
