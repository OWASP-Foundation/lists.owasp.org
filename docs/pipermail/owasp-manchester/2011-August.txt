Hi Manchester folks,
cc Leeds and London,

I'm pleased to announce that the first Manchester OWASP meeting is
confirmed.
Its on Wednesday 24th August and is being hosted by KPMG.
OK, so we've already had 2 meetings in Manchester, but they were part of the
Leeds chapter - this is the first of 'our own' ;)

We've got 2 great talks lined up:

   - SSL: Paved with Good Intentions
   Speaker: Richard Moore, CTO Westpoint Ltd <http://www.westpoint.ltd.uk/>


   - Forensic Readiness ? Give your investigators a fighting chance
   Speaker: Ryan Jones,
SpiderLabs<https://www.trustwave.com/spiderLabs.php>Incident Response
Team leader

And we've got time for another speaker if anyone else volunteers - just get
in touch with me or one of the other chapter leaders.

For more info and to book on the event please see:

Cheers,

Simon

Hi folks,

Just realized that the map link on the Eventbrite page isnt quite accurate.

Hopefully this one is a bit better:

http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=kpmg+office+manchester&hl=en&ll=53.480793,-2.245717&spn=0.00784,0.027337&fb=1&gl=uk&sqi=2&view=map&cid=11567506927986507605&vpsrc=0&z=16&layer=c&cbll=53.480881,-2.245637&cbp=12,192.31381373563698,,0,0

The KPMG office entrance is on the corner of John Dalton St and St Jame's
Square. If your coming down from Princess St then its on your right.

Many thanks to KPMG for sponsoring this event.

Hi folks,

If you're coming tonight then please pick up your badge from the KPMG
reception.
If you got one of the reassigned tickets then you might not have a badge, so
you'll have to sign in.
If there are any problems then reception will know how to contact myself or
Jason, who's providing invaluable help (once again).

Cheers,

Simon

Hi folks,

Immo Huneke has forwarded the details of the BCS meeting thats being held in
Manchester which he mentioned last Wednesday:

BCS Software Practice Advancement specialist group
==================================================

Experience some of the most popular sessions from the recent SPA2011
conference, for free, at miniSPA2011 on Monday, October 3rd at Manchester
Conference Centre. (Yes, Manchester, not London, for a change!)

The miniSPA2011 one-day programme features six sessions, in two streams,
that give an excellent guide to the variety and quality you'll find at
every SPA conference.

If you attended SPA2011 you might find that miniSPA2011 allows you to
catch up with sessions you missed at the event.

We hope that attending miniSPA will encourage you to submit a session
proposal for SPA2012, which will be taking place from July 1-4 (London).

For more information visit:
http://minispa2011.eventbrite.com/

Booking is essential and places are limited, so reserve yours now.

Cheers,

Simon
