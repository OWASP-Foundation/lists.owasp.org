We've finally arranged another OWASP Manchester Event, for Tuesday 30th
April.

We're just finalizing the talks, but I wanted to give you as much warning
as possible.

You can sign up here: http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6185373619 or wait
until we announce the talks, which we'll do on this list and on the
Manchester home page: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester

Many thanks to PwC for hosting this event.

Cheers,

Simon

Hi folks,

OWASP is a mentoring organisation for the Google Summer of Code 2013 :)
And I'll be one of the mentors again (cant have everything I suppose;)
Does anyone have any university contacts?
If so can you forward this to them?

Cheers,

Simon

sure you are there on time.

Cheers,

Simon

Hi,



We have had to change the date, time and room for the upcoming talk this week.



Date: Thursday April 25th

Time : 1pm - 2pm
Room: Adsetts 6620

Overview: Even with the highest levels of cyber-security, the human element of a government or organisation is potentially the most vulnerable to targeting by cyber-criminals, in a bid to gain unlawful access to data, services, buildings, systems or to specific individuals. Operatives may also be forced to carry actions against their will, by criminals making threats against them, their families, colleagues or friends.

Due to the rapid development of the Internet and the unprecedented growth of social media, never before has so much information been so freely available on peoples? lives, habits, movements and relationships. The latest smart phones and tablets can create geo-locational data and with the improved accuracy of GPS, the growth of mobile malware, harvesting of personal data by apps, along with the popularity of using social media, a new level of risk exists that has not been experienced before.

Many government operatives may not be regular users of social networks or smart phones, but their children, spouse or friends may be; therefore by targeting these individuals there is a strong chance of cyber-criminals engineering their way to the operatives and organisation. By explaining some methods used by criminals, such as profiling of potential victims, along with some case studies, Mr Benford will demonstrate some of the risks involved and their mitigation. This will also cover how to use portable devices such as tablets and smart phones safely.
