Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Stepping down as OWASP Manchester chapter leader
Message-ID: <CAORxfg6frHB9Qg0nj53eHpK2cnxFm_XrNC=_BuxLmJchSKCMcw@mail.gmail.com>

I've decided to step down as an OWASP Manchester chapter leader as I havnt
been able to dedicate enough time to the chapter.
Luckily we have a set of other chapter leaders who are happy to take this
on: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester#tab=Chapter_Leaders

I'll still do my best to attend future chapter meetings, and will always be
happy to talk about ZAP at them :P

Thank you for your support and I look forward to seeing you all again
before too long :)

Cheers,

Simon

I'd like to publicly thank Simon for all the hard work he's done setting up
and leading the Manchester chapter.
It wouldn't have happened without him.
The chapter has developed from the first meeting where I was a lonely
developer into something that covers the range from pen testers to
developers to managers.

Id' just like to reassure everyone that we're still active and that the
next meeting is on 16th June at Spaceport X
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester#tab=Next_Meeting

We are looking for speakers, so please let us know.
There is the possibility of covering travel expenses if a speaker from
outside of Manchester is interested.

Also "Thank You" to Veracode who recently become a gold chapter sponsor.

Cheers
Joe

*OWASP Manchester - 16th June 2016*

*Presentations:*


*Dr. Ali Dehghantanha - Digital Forensics: The Missing Piece of the
Internet of Things Promise*

*Abstract:* Every new device we create, every sensor we deploy, every byte
we synchronize to other locations will at some point come under scrutiny in
the course of investigations and legal matters. Yet no reliable forensics
applications nor digital forensics guidance exists to retrieve the data
from IoT devices in the event of a cyber event, an active investigation or
a litigation request. The digital forensics of internet of things (IoT)
technologies is the missing conversation in our headlong rush to the
promise of connecting every device on the planet. This presentation discuss
about issues and importance of further development in this field and
elaborates on how forensics practitioners, device manufacturers and legal
authorities could share the efforts and minimise this gap.

*Speaker's Bio:* Dr. Ali Dehghantanha is a Marie-Curie International
Incoming Fellow in Cyber Forensics and has served for many years in a
variety of research and industrial positions. Other than Ph.D in Cyber
Security he holds many professional certificates such as GREM, CISM, CISSP,
and CCFP. He has served as an expert witness, cyber forensics analysts and
malware researcher with leading players in Cyber-Security and E-Commerce.
Additional information can be found at http://alid.info


*Paul Johnson - Teaching secure coding*

*Abstract:* Many organisations invest heavily in detecting application
vulnerabilities, using static analysis and pen testing. Another tool in
your security arsenal is to prevent vulnerabilities being introduced in the
first place. To help with this, Pentest provide a "Secure coding workshop".
The workshop teaches developers how to code securely, and avoid
vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XML external entities. Having run
this course with several programming languages, and students of various
abilities, we've learned a lot about the pedagogy of secure coding. In this
talk we share some of our key insights for delivering a successful secure
coding workshop.

*Speaker's Bio:* Paul is a security consultant at Pentest, working mostly
on web application tests, and the secure coding workshop. He is interested
in static analysis, and how frameworks can encourage developers to write
secure applications. When he's not on the computer, you might see him
running or on a mountain bike.


*Jennie Williams - Tackling Cyber Crime in the North West*

*Abstract:* The National Security Strategy categorised cyber-attacks as a
Tier One threat to our national security, alongside international
terrorism. The threat to our national security from cyber-attacks is real
and growing. Terrorists, hostile states and cyber criminals are among those
targeting computer systems in the UK. We all need to work together to
combat this threat and help protect one another.


Please email the list if you want to speak at a future OWASP Manchester
event.
