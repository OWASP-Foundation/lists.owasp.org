Subject: [Owasp-manchester] Last nights event
Message-ID: <CAORxfg4jY6xW-BiTzBgCE+pqP8c9k79081uJUcFkTNdXjG3xxw@mail.gmail.com>

A big thank you to last nights speakers and our sponsors KPMG and MDSec.
Thats the highest number of attendees we've ever had, and as far as I could
tell it seemed a great success.

Feedback (via this list, twitter or direct to chapter leads) always
appreciated.

And please get in touch if you'd like to speak at or sponsor a future event.

Unfortunately due to a mixup the event was not videoed :(
Apologies to those who couldnt make it.

Cheers,

Simon
