Thank you to all who attended, I enjoyed it.

Keep watching for news on the next event, which should be November or December.

We have covered OWASP material directly at past events, and will continue to do so, but I don't consider it a requirement. The important thing is that it relates to web application security. How tenuous the link is depends on what we can get people to talk about and what people want to see.

We have covered the OWASP Top 10 a few times, the last one being about the 2013 updates, but there is really only so much you can tell people about it. When you get to people talking about their use of the OWASP Top 10, it tends to be as a checklist, which is really not the intention, it's more of an awareness tool.

The testing and developer guides, and ASVS, we might be able to get more out of, but I don't know of anyone who uses them directly (or let on about it)--it's more, "we have our methodology already in place, do we do everything these guides/standards say, and can we deal with all the questions that may arise from clients who have seen them?" This is just my experience; the project page claims there are users, but gives no clue as to whether this is as a direct implementation or as a reference.

I mentioned the ASVS in my introduction/news bit, and dedicated more time to it because I thought it was important. Although I mentioned one of the changes, I think I forgot to say why: the previous version was not well adopted, which brought about one of the changes that it is hoped will increase adoption - instead of instructing how to verify a given security control (e.g. by using a specific technique), the new version sets out what should be verified, which should be a much more flexible approach. The introduction of the cursory level 0 is intended to provide a flexible baseline that organisations can use to mesh the ASVS with their existing standards.

Venturing back to the talks: we could ask speakers to keep OWASP in mind during their presentation and reference related OWASP materials wherever applicable. This might increase the awareness of the OWASP materials. Would that help?

Of course, if you have any OWASP projects in mind, let us know and we'll see what we can do about getting someone to talk about them.

It covered a couple of the impacts: loss of confidentiality - e.g. information leakage from files intended to be accessible only by privileged users; and denial of service through excessive resource consumption.

There is definitely a balance to be made between introductory and not so introductory talks, and between the more and less technical. I think we need to keep attracting newcomers, but at the same time push the boundaries and bring something new, which inevitably has to be based on some prior knowledge because starting from the start each time would take some time.

I hope that answers some of your email, I did go on a bit :)

Thanks for the feedback,
Simon

That's great Simon many thanks for taking the time to address my comments, which you have done quite nicely - and my feed back came with the caveat that it was my first attendance at your meetings!

Look forward to the next event.

D.

Ps. apologies if there are people on this email distribution list that didn't want to read my spam :) I thought about speaking up at the meeting but wasn't sure what others thought so kept it to email instead.

Rich, who spoke at the this month's event on XML attacks, just pointed this out:

XML external entity and billion laughs flaws in Apache POI, a Java API for reading Office Open XML documents.
