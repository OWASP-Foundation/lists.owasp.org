Hi everyone,

Firstly thanks to everyone who braved the glorious Manchester weather to
head over to SpacePortX last night - it was great to see you all! Hopefully
everyone enjoyed the event, but if you've got any feedback on things we can
do better (or praise for things we did right!) we'd love to hear from you.

Also thanks to our sponsors for the evening SpacePortX  (venue), Avecto
(beer and pizza) and our new gold chapter sponsors Veracode.

We're now about to start planning our next event so if anyone wants to
volunteer or suggest a talk please let us know. We have a small amount of
money available to pay for travel expenses - just get in touch if you need
details.

We're also looking for a venue and sponsorship for the refreshments, so
again, just get in touch if you (or your employer) want to get involved.

Hope to see you all again next time - watch this space for details of when
and where that will be!

Regards,

Daniel
