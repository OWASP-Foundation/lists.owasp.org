<PRE>Hello all,

We will be having our next event most likely on the 3rd of May at the
University Place on Oxford Road. We are finalizing organisation of the
event, however, we have a request for all willing to speak at the event.

We are still looking for one or two speakers for the event. We wanted to
make some career oriented event, so if you are involved in hiring process
or head hunting security professionals or you have spend a lots of years in
security fields and you think your career had interesting turns that other
would like to hear about, please let me know. We have one speaker on the
topic, but looking for additional one or two.

Also, we are happy to host one normal talk or rookie talk. So if you have
any new research that you would like to present, also let me know.

I know it is a bit of a short notice, but we would really appreciate if
people can help us with additional presentations and contribute to
successful event after a longer break.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Nikola Milo&#353;evi&#263;
OWASP Manchester local chapter leader
