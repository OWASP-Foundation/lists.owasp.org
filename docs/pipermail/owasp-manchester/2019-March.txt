Sorry to intrude on your mail list but I need to let the [Owasp-manchester] members know that the OWASP Foundation is shutting down all the mail lists run by Mailman on lists.owasp.org on March 22, 2019.

Here is a one-click link to join the new Google Group which is replacing this list:

The new Group is also available online at:

Detailed Information on how join the Group is at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA

NOTE:  You are not required to have a Google account, an @owasp.org email address, or to provide your phone number to join and participate in the new manchester-chapter at owasp.org Group - just an email address.

Finally, full details on the plan to retire Mailman, links and FAQs are  at: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL
