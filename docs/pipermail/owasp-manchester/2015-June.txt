Subject: [Owasp-manchester] OWASP Manchester meeting update - 17th June 2015
Message-ID: <CAE2FC8DcS0UWukRveBF1g=0444wg+CCzeBaRP8NeicLt2UgCFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,


The next OWASP Manchester meeting will be at 6pm on Wednesday 17th June at
UK Fast's offices in Hulme. UKFast will be sponsoring the venue and bar.
NCC Group will sponsor the pizza.


There are currently 52 tickets left, though we can release a few more if
the need arises. If you have a ticket no longer wish to come then please
email stuartw1 at gmail.com and I will release it for someone else to take up.
This also helps with estimating the amount of pizza and drinks to buy.


Currently the planned talks are:

William Knowles "Do we need standardisation in penetration testing?"

Dr. Ali Dehghantanha "Distributed File Systems Investigation: Ceph as a
case-study"

Mark Goodwin "What we (Mozilla) and other browser vendors are doing about
various problems with Internet PKI"

This will be updated with further detail as speakers provide it. A
lightning talk session may also be held if there is time to spare. There
will also be some time for networking.

Email the OWASP Manchester mailing list or stuartw1 at gmail.com if you
require further details.


Hope to see you there!


This meeting is kindly sponsored by UKFast <http://www.ukfast.co.uk/> and NCC
Group <https://www.nccgroup.trust/>

Hello everyone,

I would like to start in Manchester OWASP reading group. Basic idea would
be that if anyone reads a book, some substantial paper or a report he could
make a presentation about what he/she had read and knowledge he/she gained
and transfer the knowledge to other members of OWASP community. After to
presentation we could discussed the covered topics and possibly make some
critic on the book (like what was explained good, what are the holes).
Basically it could be any security related book or work, from certification
study guides to books about malware, forensics, various attacks, defenses,
etc. It could be from basics to advanced topic in security. The frequency
of the meeting is probably dependent on people reading and willing to
present. But I would hope we will be able to make one gathering in each
month, or every two months.

I hope you'd like the idea. First thing would I would like to hear from you
is whether someone read some interesting book recently and is willing to
tell us about? Afterwards we will set the time and venue for the first
meeting.

Also, to mention, this will not interfere in anyway to regular OWASP
Manchester meetings. It is quite different concept and I would see it as
more rookie thing where anyone can present about a book or paper he/she
read recently.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
Nikola Milo?evi?
