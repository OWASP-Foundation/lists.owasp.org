	Slides
Message-ID: <CAORxfg6CVWhh5A86vfYMYbvSrjAhQT-HnKCJnejVy5DgSWskPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Thanks again to Dominic for a great talk, and to everyone who came along
and helped make it such a good evening.
I've uploaded all of the slides:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2012_02_01_Manchester (also linked off the
Manchester 'Past Events' tab).
For some reason the wiki would only allow me to upload my slides in .ppxt
format - if you'd like them in another format (eg pps) just let me know.

We had some good discussions about what types of talks we should have at
future meetings - I'll kick off another thread for that (and not spam the
other UK lists;).

As I mentioned at the meeting, please feel free to tell everyone about
other related events via this list.

Oh, and just to stay true to form (and because its too good an opportunity
to miss), as per my sig, OWASP ZAP won the Toolsmith Tool of the Year
2011<http://holisticinfosec.blogspot.com/2012/02/2011-toolsmith-tool-of-year-owasp-zap.html>poll!
Thanks to everyone who's contributed to ZAP and voted for it :)

Cheers,

Simon

Hi folks,

Just to let you know a couple of things:

We're in the process of setting up 2 new UK chapters -
Bristol<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bristol>and
Newcastle <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newcastle>.
Still early stages, but please publicize them and join the relevant mailing
lists if you're interested in getting involved (running/speaking/attending)
in them.

And we've just set up a new list: owasp-uk-leaders at lists.owasp.org
If you are an OWASP UK Chapter leader then please join this list - the
intention is to use it for things like helping to arrange speakers, trying
to make sure our meetings dont clash, exchanging tips and trick etc etc.
You can also join it if you just want to know whats going on - after all
OWASP is an open organization :)

Cheers,

Simon

Yeah, that would be easy to set up, and well worth doing.

I like Tom's idea for an all UK list, but only if its automatic, ie just
includes the individual chapter lists, otherwise most people wont sign up.
Have to see if thats possible...

While we're discussing new UK chapters; what are the thoughts on an 
east-mids chapter?

I know a number of people in Derby and Nottingham who would be able to 
support an East Mids chapter who can't make it to Birmingham 
frequently. I'm also East Mids based.

I know Mozilla would be supportive of me spending some time on this 
(many of my colleagues are heavily involved in OWASP); also, I've got 
good contacts at a few of the local Universities (could be useful for 
hosting events, etc).
