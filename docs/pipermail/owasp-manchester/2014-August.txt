We had planned to do the next meeting week commencing 11th of August. Unfortunately, due to many of the chapter leaders being busy or not even in the country, and one even having to step down due to other commitments, we will be postponing the meeting.

No date is fixed yet. I'm aiming for the second week of September. Potential topics for talks are social engineering, physical intrusion, and XML external entity inclusion attacks.

As always, if you would like to talk, or know anyone who can, or would just like to request a talk on a particular topic, please do not hesitate to contact us by email to this list or the chapter leaders.

Do also contact us if you are interested in being a chapter leader.  The more the merrier, and between us we should be able to keep the show on the road.

Greetings,

The next event will be held on the 8th September 2014. Thanks go to Pentest, who are sponsoring with drinks and pizza, and PwC, who are hosting, at Barbirolli Square, a place I'm sure many of you are familiar with by now.

Event details can be found on the wiki:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester#Next_Meeting

Registration, which I ask that all attending do as we need to provide a list of attendees to security, is via Eventbrite:

https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-chapter-8th-september-2014-tickets-1825174145

We have Craig Fox presenting "Manipulation 101", a talk about social engineering. Richard Moore is presenting "When XML Attacks", about XML External Entities.

Afterwards I hope to get some discussion about what you want to see at future events, before decamping to a pub, probably the Britons Protection.

Regards,
Simon Ward
