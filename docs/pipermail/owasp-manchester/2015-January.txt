The next OWASP Manchester chapter meeting will be on Tuesday 17th February.
We'll be announcing the full lineup soon, but I wanted to give you all a
chance to book it in your diaries.
And we anticipate that this will be a very popular event, so get ready to
register as soon as the tickets become available!

The event details are now on the OWASP Manchester wiki page
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester>.
And the tickets are available on Eventbrite
<https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-chapter-17th-february-2015-tickets-15434339525>
.

Quick summary of the talks:

*New web appsec research - James Kettle*

James Kettle is a web security researcher on the Burp Suite team. He will
be talking about a prevalent but little-understood web vulnerability, with
a real example of a recent 0day in a popular web platform.

*OWASP ZAP 2.4.0 - Simon Bennetts*

ZAP is an OWASP Flagship project and the most active open source web
application scanner. Simon is the OWASP ZAP project lead and works for
Mozilla as part of their security team. In this talk Simon will give an
overview of the new features available in the forthcoming 2.4.0 release.

*New features of Burp + New Web appsec research and scanning challenges -
Dafydd Stuttard*

Dafydd Stuttard is the creator of Burp Suite and author of The Web
Application Hacker's Handbook. He will be talking about a new technique for
web testing that will soon be available in Burp Suite, and which will
enable the automated and manual discovery of many types of vulnerability
that currently elude all but the best penetration testers.
This will probably be the only chance this year to hear about both the new
features in Burp and ZAP from the respective project leaders, so we expect
this event to be very popular - *book now!*
We wont be publicizing this on social media sites until tomorrow to give
regulars a chance to get tickets :)

Cheers,

Simon

The first set of tickets have now all gone.

We hope to be able to release some more soon, but I'd expect those to go
quickly as well, so dont hang about.

If for any reason you are unable to use your ticket then please cancel it
so that it will be available for someone else.

We do plan to video the talks for those unable to attend.

Cheers,

Simon

We have more tickets available, thanks to Ben Ramduny and KPMG.
But do book asap if you want to come along - these may well also sell out!

Cheers,

And they have all gone - either taken or reserved by people who registered
interest after the first set sold out.
If you have one and find you cant go then please cancel it so that someone
else can take it.

Many thanks,

Simon

Yeah, looks like you have a ticket but were also on the wait list - I've
removed you from that.
