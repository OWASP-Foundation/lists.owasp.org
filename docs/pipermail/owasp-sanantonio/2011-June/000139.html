San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Thursday, June 16, 2011

Topic: Building a Secure Login

Presenter: Ben Broussard

Date: Thursday, June 16, 2011

Time: 11:30am-1:00pm

Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room) 3463 Magic Drive San Antonio, TX 78229 <A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229</A>


Abstract: This talk takes the standard, cookie-based login and authorization functionality through its paces. First I will walk through the requirements of common, single sign-on functionality. Then I will walk through attacks and their countermeasures including SQL injection and parameterized queries, session fixation and cookie cycling, session hijacking and about a dozen necessary countermeasures, and so on. The discussion will be programming language agnostic, instead focusing on the functional specifications.

Presenter Bio: Ben Broussard has been involved in the Austin OWASP chapter since 2008, giving technical talks, serving on the LASCON board, the chapter board, and organizing a study group. Outside of OWASP he has worn the hats of mainframe and web application developer, cryptographer, pentester, and he recently launched his own application security business, Kedalion Security, LLC. On the side he does research into brains and AI, and is an avid 80's dancer.


Lunch will be provided.
