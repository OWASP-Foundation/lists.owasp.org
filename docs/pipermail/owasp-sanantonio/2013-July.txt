Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Jarret Raim and Matt Tesauro: tomorrow
Message-ID: <CE01C9D5.EAD67%dan@denimgroup.com>

All:

OWASP San Antonio is tomorrow Wednesday July 10th, 2013 at 11:30 at the
San Antonio technology Center. Come see Jarret Raim and Matt Tesauro talk
about cloud-based key management.

Wednesday, July 10th, 2013
Topic: Cloud Keep: Protect Your Secrets at Scale
Presenters: Jarret Raim and Matt Tesauro
Date: Wednesday, July 10, 2013
Time: 11:30am-1:00pm
Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)

Abstract:
One saying in the software security world has rung true for longer than
any other ? encryption is easy, key management is hard. Unfortunately, the
tools we have for properly generating, storing, using and protecting keys
are sorely lacking. This presentation will present a "key management as a
service" architecture that allows for rapid scaling, Cloud use cases while
achieving high security, auditability and compliance using open source
technologies.

Also for those of you who might be interested (and weren't at yesterday's
meeting) I wanted to reiterate that if you are an OWASP Member based here

you want to attend any of the pre-LASCON training events. Currently I am
scheduled to give a course titled "Running a Software Security Program

Matt Tesauro will be running another pre-LASCON course in September that
teaches web application testing with OWASP's WTE (Web Testing Environment)

All right sorry I'm bad at the Internet. I sent that last email out
half-composed. Here's the actual intended full email.

This will also include some new material on testing REST web services. I
will send along a link once the dates on that are locked down.

If you are an OWASP Member based here in San Antonio and you are
interested in attending either/both courses for free send me an email and
I will work to get you registered.

*** PLEASE NOTE *** I don't get paid more if we have more folks in my
course so this isn't a scheme to line my pockets with OWASP San Antonio
money. Instead this is a way to hopefully use some of the funds that we
have allocated to OWASP San Antonio for the benefit of the OWASP San
Antonio community. If you have any questions please let me know.


Thanks,

Dan

Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Matt Tesauro's pre-LASCON training class
Message-ID: <CE1D3CA7.FD323%dan@denimgroup.com>

All:

Thanks to the San Antonio folks who attended my class last week in Austin
on running a software security program on open source tools. Hopefully
everybody had a good time and learned some stuff. I had a great time
giving the class.

Next up: Matt Tesauro will be giving a class titled "Hands on Web and REST
Testing: Assessing Apps the OWASP Way" The class will run September 16th
and 17th up in Austin at the Norris Conference Center. Just like the last
one, this will be FREE for OWASP San Antonio members. Use the registration
code:
SA_SPECIAL


More information is online here:
http://lascon.org/training/rest-testing-training-class/


Let me know if you have any questions. I hope a lot of folks take
advantage of this offer - these pre-LASCON training events are a great way
to get access to cool training at a fraction of what you'd normally pay.
Do it!

Thanks,


Dan
