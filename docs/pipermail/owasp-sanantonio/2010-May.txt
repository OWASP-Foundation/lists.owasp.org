San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wed May 19th, 2010
Topic: The Open Software Assurance Maturity Model
Presenter: Dan Cornell, Principal, Denim Group
Date: Wednesday May 19th, 2010 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:

Abstract:
The Open Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) (http://www.opensamm.org/) is a flexible and prescriptive framework for building security into a software development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based models for security, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their security assurance program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned to the specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure software development throughout the typical governance, development, and deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable management within an organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through iterations of building a security assurance program. 

This workshop will introduce the SAMM framework and walk through useful activities such as assessing an assurance program, mapping an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowing, additional case studies will also be discussed. OpenSAMM is an open a free project and has recently been donated to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation. For more information on OpenSAMM, visit http://www.opensamm.org/.
