<PRE>All:

OWASP board member Matt Tesauro will be presenting at the OWASP San Antonio chapter meeting on Wednesday January 20th, 2010.  I think this is a great way to kick off 2010 for the San Antonio chapter and I can't wait for the presentation.  Also - all attendees will get a free copy of the OWASP LiveCD.

Here are the specifics:

Topic: OWASP LiveCD: An Open Environment for Web Application Security
Presenter: Matt Tesauro, OWASP Board Member, LiveCD Project Lead
Date: Wednesday January 20th, 2010 11:30am - 1:00pm

<A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229</A>

Abstract: The OWASP Live CD is a project that collects some of the best open source security projects in a single environment. Web developers, testers and security professionals can boot from this Live CD and have access to a full security testing suite. This allows its users to test for various security issues in web applications and web sites. The Live CD also contains documentation and an interactive learning environment to enhance users' web application security knowledge. This presentation will cover the current state of the OWASP Live CD as well as the plans for future developments. Time permitting, a live demonstration of the OWASP Live CD will be conducted. The OWASP Live CD is a project of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and is free for commercial or non-commercial use. More information is available at: <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Live_CD_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Live_CD_Project</A>
