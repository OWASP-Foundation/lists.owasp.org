<PRE>Hey Everyone,

I hope that you all have taken the opportunity to sign up for this year's
Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON).  It features some of the
same high-quality speakers that you would find at conferences like BlackHat
at a fraction of the price.  It is also the biggest fundraiser for the
OWASP Austin chapter and provides the money that we need in order to
sustain things like food and giveaways without charging a fee like other
organizations are now doing.  The talks are up, the bull is back, and we
want to see you there.  Get registered if you haven't already at
<A HREF="http://lascon.org.">http://lascon.org.</A>  Passes are selling quickly so don't risk waiting so
long that they've sold out.

Speaking of risk....(see what I did there)....I will be doing a full-day
risk management training at this year's conference on 10/22.  If you
attended one of the half-days I did in Austin, San Antonio, or Minneapolis,
then this will be similar, but will also walk students through the process
of installing SimpleRisk and all of the finer details of working with the
tool that we didn't get into in the other class.  Instead of using the
hosted version of SimpleRisk, every student will walk away with a
functioning instance in a VM environment and the knowledge to perform the
installation, configuration, and management themselves.  Sure, you could go
out and spent $500k+ on a GRC tool that you'll never full utilize, or you
can spend a mere $249 to spend a day hanging out with me, talking risk
management, learning the ins and outs of SimpleRisk, with meals included.
You can register for my training at LASCON here:

LASCON is a fantastic conference, run by great people, and benefiting the
OWASP Foundation.  I hope that you will take the time to register and join
us there next month!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
