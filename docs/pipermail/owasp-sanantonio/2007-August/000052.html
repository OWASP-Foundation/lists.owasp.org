Abstract:
Over the past decade, the Department of Defense in general, and the US
Air Force in particular, has transformed itself to better deal with 21st
century warfare.  The Air Force in fact has modified its stated mission
to include cyberspace as one of the domains in which it will &quot;fly and
fight.&quot;  This type of shift in strategic thinking is critical for any
organization to properly acknowledge and manage real-world threats
against one of its most valuable assets:  data.

Despite modernized mission statements and mindsets, organizations
continue to have difficulty implementing a course of action for dealing
with the threats against software systems serving up their data.  It is
easy to talk about buying and implementing software security tools for
developers, QA testers and post-deployment operators; however, schedules
and budgets quickly go bust without consideration of the common
obstacles.

This presentation describes an application security strategy for large
enterprise systems-what to look out for, and what you must do to ensure
the successful rollout of the tools and services necessary to counter
the dark side of cyberspace. 

Presenter Bio:
Major Bruce C. Jenkins, USAF (Ret.) is Security Practice Director at
Fortify Software, Inc., where his responsibilities include refining
customer security requirements, managing Fortify product deployments and
delivering security services.

Prior to joining Fortify, he spent 26 of his 28 years in the service
leading people, managing projects, and dealing with technological and
organizational change.  His military experiences range from managing a
small team of aircraft avionics technicians to commanding a
communications unit supporting over 3,000 U.S. and international forces
in Southwest Asia.  Most recently, as Chief of Systems Security, 554th
Electronic Systems Wing, he helped establish a nearly $13M budget for
creating the Air Force's first ever Center of Excellence for
applications security.

Bruce holds a BS in computer science from the University of Maryland and
MS in operations research from the Air Force Institute of Technology.
He is a Certified Ethical Hacker with countless hours of Internet surf
time, where he has learned that paranoia is a perfectly legitimate state
of mind.

Sodas and snacks will be provided.  Feel free to bring a brown-bag
lunch.
