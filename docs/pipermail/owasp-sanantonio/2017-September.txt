Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Next Friday: Managing application security at
	scale
Message-ID: <5CB0FFEA-A06D-4922-B5BD-AEFE9B03943E@denimgroup.com>

All:

We will be having an OWASP San Antonio meeting next Friday:
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-San-Antonio/events/243566540/

We will be hosting Brandon Triance-Haldane from Security Compass. He will be talking about ?How Billion Dollar Enterprises Manage Application Security at Scale?

Security Compass recently completed a comprehensive research study by surveying companies across multiple industries with the goal of discovering how large, complex organizations address application security at scale.  The majority of respondents surveyed were multinational organizations who reported annual earnings greater than $1 billion USD.  Through this new research study, we have gleamed novel insights on how large organizations manage application security at scale.  Through this presentation, we will reveal aggregated insights, industry trends, and best practices that illuminate how organizations are addressing application security at scale, so that you may apply and compare these learnings to the state of application security at your own organization.

Hope to see folks there!

Thanks,

Dan
