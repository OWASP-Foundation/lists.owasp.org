San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Fri. August 13, 2010

Topic: 1)How OWASP Works and Guided Tour of OWASP Projects / 2) Using the O2 Platform to Consume OWASP projects

Presenter: Dinis Cruz

Date: Friday, August 13, 2010, 2010 11:30am - 1:00pm

Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room) 3463 Magic Drive San Antonio, TX 78229 http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229


Abstract: 1) How OWASP Works and Guided Tour of OWASP Projects - This presentation will focus on my experience in getting things done at OWASP, what resources are available and what types of initiatives should the local chapters be doing. In addition to a quick overview of a number of key OWASP projects, this talk will also provide a tutorial on how the OWASP WIKI (MediaWiki based) can be used as a database (using the MediaWiki templates technology)

2) Using the O2 Platform to Consume OWASP projects - This presentation will focus on how to consume the OWASP Wiki and a number of OWASP projects using the OWASP O2 Platform. The O2 Platform has powerful technology and capabilities for both BlackBox and WhiteBox analysis and this presentation will provide examples on how to use O2 with: WebGoat, WebScarab, Code Crawler, Dir Buster, Testing Guide, Code Review Guide and OpenSAMM

The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge and workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough 'source-code-driven' application security reviews (BlackBox + WhiteBox). In addition to the manual findings created/discovered by security consultants, the OWASP O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of results from multiple OWASP projects and commercial scanning tools. This allows security consultants to find, exploit and automate (via Unit Tests) security vulnerabilities usually dismissed by the community as impossible to find/recreate. More importantly, it provides the Security Consultants a mechanism to: a) 'talk' with developers (via UnitTest) , b) give developers a way to replicate + "check if it's fixed" the vulnerabilities reported and c) engage on a two-way conversion on the best way to fix/remediate those vulnerabilities.


Presenter Bio: Dinis Cruz is a Security Consultant based in London (UK) and specialized in: ASP.NET/J2EE Application Security, Application Security audits and .NET Security Curriculum Development. For the past years Dinis has focused on the field of Static Source Code analysis, from May 2007 to Dec 2009 he worked as a independent consultant for Ounce Labs (bought by IBM in July 2009) where during active security engagements using Ounce's technology he developed the Open Source codebase which now is the foundation of the OWASP O2 Platform. Dinis is currently focused on making the O2 Platform the industry standard for consuming, instrumenting and data-sharing between the multiple WebAppSec tools, the Security consultants and the final developers. Dinis is a also active trainer on .Net security having written and delivered courses for IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG (at multiple locations including BlackHat), and has delivered a number of presentations and keynote speeches at multiple OWASP and Security related conferences At OWASP, Dinis is the leader of the OWASP O2 Platform project, member of the OWASP Global Projects Committee, chair of the OWASP Connections Committee and member of the OWASP

San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wed August 18, 2010

Topic: Which Web Programming Languages are Most Secure?

Presenter: Jeremiah Grossman, Founder and CTO, WhiteHat Security

Date: Wednesday, August 18, 2010 11:30am - 1:00pm

Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room) 3463 Magic Drive San Antonio, TX 78229 http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229


Abstract: Security-conscious organizations make implementing a software security development lifecycle a priority. As part of the process, they evaluate a large number of development technologies for building websites. The assumption by many is that not all development environments are created equal. So the question often asked is, "What is the most secure programming language or development framework available?"


Clearly, familiarity with a specific product, whether it is designed to be secure-by-default or must be configured properly, and whether various libraries are available, can drastically impact the outcome. Still, conventional wisdom suggests that most popular modern languages / frameworks (commercial & open source) perform relatively similarly when it comes to an overall security posture. At least in theory, none is markedly or noticeably more secure than another. Suggesting PHP, Java, C# and others are any more secure than other frameworks is sure to spark heated debate.


As has been said in the past, "In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is." Until now, no website security study has provided empirical research measuring how various Web programming languages / frameworks actively perform in the field. To which classes of attack are they most prone, how often and for how long; and, how do they fare against popular alternatives? Is it really true that popular modern languages / frameworks yield similar results in production websites?


By analyzing the vulnerability assessment results of nearly 1,700 websites under WhiteHat Sentinel management, we may begin to answer some of these questions. These answers may enable the website security community to ask better and deeper questions, which will eventually lead to more secure websites. Organizations deploying these technologies can have a closer look at particularly risk-prone areas; software vendors may focus on areas found lacking; and, developers will increase their familiarity with the strength and weaknesses of their technology stack. All of this is vitally important because security must be baked into development frameworks and be virtually transparent. Only then will application security progress be made.


Presenter Bio: Jeremiah Grossman founded WhiteHat Security in August 2001.


A world-renowned expert in Web security, Mr. Grossman is a founder of the Web Application Security Consortium (WASC), and was named to InfoWorld's Top 25 CTOs for 2007.


Mr. Grossman is a frequent speaker at industry events including the Black Hat Briefings, RSA Conference, ISACA, CSI, InfoSec World, OWASP, ISSA, and Defcon as well as a number of large universities. He has authored dozens of articles and white papers, is credited with the discovery of many cutting-edge attack and defensive techniques and is a co-author of XSS Attacks: Cross Site Scripting Exploits and Defense.


Mr. Grossman is frequently quoted in major media outlets such as USA Today, the Washington Post, The Financial Times, InformationWeek, InfoWorld, USA Today, PC World, Dark Reading, SC Magazine, CNET, CSO and NBC news. He frequently alerts the media community to the latest attacks and is not only able to offer in-depth commentary, but also provide his perspective of what's to come.


Mr. Grossman was named a "friend of Google" and is also an influential blogger (www.jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com) who offers insight and encourages open dialogue regarding current research and vulnerability trend information.


Prior to WhiteHat, Mr. Grossman was an information security officer at Yahoo! responsible for performing security reviews on the company's hundreds of websites. Before Yahoo!, Mr. Grossman worked for Amgen, Inc.

submissions continue to roll in on an almost daily basis and we are getting
super excited about giving you what will soon become the best application
security conference in the state for the absolute least amount of money
possible.  Here's just a sample of people who have already submitted to
speak at our conference:


   - Robert Hansen (CEO of SecTheory, LLC)
   - Chris Eng (Senior Director of Security Research, Veracode)
   - Dan Cornell (Principal, Denim Group)
   - Joe Jarzombek (Director for Software Assurance, Global Cyber Security
   Management, National Cyber Security Division, Department of Homeland
   Security)
   - Samy Kamkar (Yeah, the "MySpace Worm" Samy)


So here's the deal....conference attendance will be severely restricted due
to space at the Norris Conference Center.  We've got room for about 200
attendees and once those seats are sold, you won't be able to buy, beg, or
cheat your way into the conference.  The good news is that we are proud to
make this the single most affordable conference that I've ever heard of.
You get a full day of sessions from a literal "Who's Who" of the security
industry for a mere $50 if you're already an OWASP member or $100 if you're
not and that includes membership!  So what are you waiting for?  We're
giving the OWASP chapters first shot at buying conference passes before we
begin advertising this out to everyone else, but we can only wait a couple
days.  After that, well, there's no telling how much longer we'll have
available passes.  Register with the following link:

If you are interested in presenting at the conference, the CFP is open
through the end of August.  Submit your papers here:

If you or your company is interested in sponsoring this awesome event, we
still have a bunch of options for you.  Check out our sponsorship page here:

So there you have it folks...the first-ever OWASP Conference in Texas will
be in Austin on October 29, 2010.  With quality presenters, affordable
passes, and an awesome location, you can't go wrong.  Get your pass while
they last!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
President

OWASP San Antonio folks:

See below for some info on LASCON in Austin this October.

We have some $$ that have accrued in the OWASP San Antonio coffers - mostly from Denim Group and Digital Defense sponsorships.  Would you all be interested in chartering a bus to bring San Antonio folks up to LASCON?  Please discuss.

Thanks,

Dan

Austin OWASPers,

While there is still another week or so left for CFP submissions, the LASCON planning committee today voted on acceptance of the first batch of speakers and presentations for the conference.  Hopefully this preliminary list will get you guys as excited as I am about LASCON:
Presentation

Name

OWASP Top 10.  What is it all about?

Dean Bushmiller

Deconstructing ColdFusion

Chris Eng

HTTPS Can Byte Me

Robert Hasen and Josh Sokol

Smart Phones with Dumb Apps: Threat Modeling for Mobile Applications

Dan Cornell

How I Met Your Girlfriend

Samy Kamkar

Mitigating Business Risks with Application Security

Joe Jarzombek

Automating Web Testing Beyond OWASP Webscarab Using Python

Brad Causey

Everything Useful I Learned About Software Security, I Learned At Microsoft

Michael Howard



That's two presentations from this years BlackHat conference, several published authors, and the Director for Software Assurance in the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security just to name a few, and that's only the preliminary round of acceptances.  The complete list and schedule won't be out for a couple of weeks, but we're seeing a steady stream of registrations and passes may not last that long.  At only $50 for OWASP members and $100 for non-members (includes a year of OWASP membership) for a full day of training, this should be a no-brainer.  Register for LASCON today and be sure to tell your friends and co-workers to get their passes before they sell out!

Conference Website: http://www.lascon.org<http://www.lascon.org/>

We'd also like to thank Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, Splunk, and Impact Security LLC for being Gold Sponsors of LASCON 2010!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
President
Austin OWASP
