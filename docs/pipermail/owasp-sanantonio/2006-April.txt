San Antonio OWASP Chapter: April 2006 Meeting
Topic: AJAX Security: Here We Go Again
Presenter: Dan Cornell of Denim Group, Ltd.
Date: Wednesday April 19th, 2006 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)
3463 Magic Drive
San Antonio, TX 78229

X+78229

Abstract:
AJAX (or Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is the hot new web programming
technique being used to create rich Internet applications.  By
interacting with the server behind the scenes and updating web page
DOMs, AJAX applications bring a new level of responsiveness to the web
and opens exciting new possibilities for creating new classes of
applications.  The success of applications such as Google Maps and
Flickr is a testament to the exciting potential AJAX techniques bring to
the discipline of web application development.

Unfortunately many organizations implementing these techniques are doing
so without considering the security implications on application design
and development.  Furthermore, because these techniques are so new the
threats and countermeasures are not well understood.  This presentation
will give an explanation of AJAX techniques and will examine the
underlying constructs and their behavior.  Next it will examine how
common web application vulnerabilities translate to AJAX environments
well as new threats that are specific to AJAX applications.  The
presentation will conclude with a demonstration of "sprajax," an
alpha-release open-source tool developed by Denim Group that analyzes
web applications for potential security vulnerabilities exposed through
the use of AJAX.

Presenter Bio:
Dan Cornell is a Principal of the Denim Group, a Texas-based consultancy
providing software development and application security services.  He
has extensive experience architecting and developing enterprise web
applications on a variety of platforms as well as training and mentoring
development teams on application security and secure coding techniques.
Dan is the creator and primary author of the sprajax open source AJAX
security assessment tool.  He is an MCSD as well as a Java 2 Certified
Programmer.

Sodas and snacks will be provided.  Feel free to bring a brown-bag
lunch.

All:

Thanks to the folks who attended last Wednesday's OWASP presentation on
AJAX security and the sprajax tool.  The slide deck is online here:
<www.denimgroup.com/knowledge/DenimGroup_AJAXSecurityHereWeGoAgain_Conte
nt.pdf>.  Right now I am cleaning up the GUI and making the tool easier
to install, and the code will be posted either later this week or by
Monday or Tuesday of next week at the latest.

Thanks,

Dan

Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Texas Regional Infrastructure Security Conference
Message-ID: <4122F6F18CC18A4FBE1DCBA11348F0ABC1DA82@satmail.denimgroup.com>

All:

Folks in San Antonio who are interested in web application security
might want to check out the Texas Regional Infrastructure Security
Conference (TRISC) (http://www.trisc.org/)  I will be giving a 3-hour
workshop on database security on Wednesday May 17th and John Dickson
will be presenting on the organizational challenges of creating secure
software on Tuesday May 16th.

This is a 3-day conference (May 15th - May 17th) in Houston, TX and the
cost is pretty reasonable (~$500).  Given the low cost, the speaker list
for this conference is fantastic - independent of John and I presenting
:)  Caleb Sima (founder of SPI Dynamics) is speaking about web
application hacks and Ira Winkler (ex-NSA) is giving a talk titled
"Everything You Wanted to Know About Taking Down the Infrastructure, But
Were Afraid To Ask"  I have seen Ira speak before and he is very
entertaining and informative.

Thanks,

Dan

San Antonio OWASP Chapter: May 2006 Meeting
Topic: How to Prevent Forceful Browsing
Presenter: Dan Ross of PIC Business Systems
Date: Wednesday May 24th, 2006 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)
3463 Magic Drive
San Antonio, TX 78229
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+T
X+78229

Abstract:
By Forceful Browsing, clients may be able to access pages which should
be forbidden. A technique for preventing forceful browsing is
introduced. With this technique, you may be assured that clients may
only visit pages for which links have been presented.

Granularity may be adjusted for an entire page, as well as for specific
page parameters. For example, you may prevent a user from deleting
customers altogether, or you may permit a user to delete customer #1,
but not customer #2. In addition, a notification system can alert you
when users are forceful browsing.

The implementation will be presented using PHP.

Presenter Bio:
Dan Ross has been VP Engineering for 17 years at PIC Business Systems,
which provides integrated business software for the Window Coverings and
Apparel Industries. He has led the design, development, and maintenance
of many commercial web applications and programs. He has a BS in
Industrial Engineering from St. Mary's University in San Antonio.

Sodas and snacks will be provided. Feel free to bring a brown-bag lunch.
