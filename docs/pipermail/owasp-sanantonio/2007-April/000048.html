<PRE>All:

We are very fortunate to have Guy Podjarney (Guypo) from Watchfire
Corporation presenting to our chapter this month.  Full details of the
presentation are below.  Guypo will be talking about a recent flaw found
by Watchfire in the Google Desktop and the talk will look at some very
interesting a nuanced issues that cross the boundaries between web-based
desktop applications (like Google Desktop) and the web.  This will be be
fun stuff.

Please note that we are starting a little early (11am) due to room
availability issues.  Hope to see folks there and feel free to invite
anyone who might be interested.

Thanks,

Dan

Abstract:
This presentation will describe an innovative attack methodology against
Google Desktop which enables an attacker to achieve remote, persistent
access to virtual all data on the victim machine, and can further lead
to full system control as well.
The attack leverages vulnerabilities in Google.com web site and Google
Desktop, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected into different
responses. In addition, it leverages the integration between Google.com
and Google Desktop.

A significant aspect of this attack is that it emphasizes the danger of
the integration between desktop applications and Web based applications,
as this opens an aperture for a malicious attacker to escalate his/her
privileges by crossing from the Web environment to the desktop
application environment.

The attack also highlights the risks associated with a fully Web based
desktop application, and with a tool like Google Desktop which allows
easy access to virtual all information on the host machine.

In the presentation we'll review the different steps of the attack,
demonstrating skipping from the Web to Google Desktop, overcoming
various protection mechanisms built into Google Desktop, and finally
exploiting the vulnerability in various ways.
