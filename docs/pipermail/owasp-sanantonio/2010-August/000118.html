<PRE>OWASP San Antonio folks:

See below for some info on LASCON in Austin this October.

We have some $$ that have accrued in the OWASP San Antonio coffers - mostly from Denim Group and Digital Defense sponsorships.  Would you all be interested in chartering a bus to bring San Antonio folks up to LASCON?  Please discuss.

Thanks,

Dan

Subject: [Owasp-austin] First Round of Speaker Acceptances Announced for LASCON

Austin OWASPers,

While there is still another week or so left for CFP submissions, the LASCON planning committee today voted on acceptance of the first batch of speakers and presentations for the conference.  Hopefully this preliminary list will get you guys as excited as I am about LASCON:
Presentation

Name

OWASP Top 10.  What is it all about?

Dean Bushmiller

Deconstructing ColdFusion

Chris Eng

HTTPS Can Byte Me

Robert Hasen and Josh Sokol

Smart Phones with Dumb Apps: Threat Modeling for Mobile Applications

Dan Cornell

How I Met Your Girlfriend

Samy Kamkar

Mitigating Business Risks with Application Security

Joe Jarzombek

Automating Web Testing Beyond OWASP Webscarab Using Python

Brad Causey

Everything Useful I Learned About Software Security, I Learned At Microsoft

Michael Howard



That's two presentations from this years BlackHat conference, several published authors, and the Director for Software Assurance in the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security just to name a few, and that's only the preliminary round of acceptances.  The complete list and schedule won't be out for a couple of weeks, but we're seeing a steady stream of registrations and passes may not last that long.  At only $50 for OWASP members and $100 for non-members (includes a year of OWASP membership) for a full day of training, this should be a no-brainer.  Register for LASCON today and be sure to tell your friends and co-workers to get their passes before they sell out!

Conference Website: <A HREF="http://www.lascon.org&lt;http://www.lascon.org/">http://www.lascon.org&lt;http://www.lascon.org/</A>&gt;

We'd also like to thank Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, Splunk, and Impact Security LLC for being Gold Sponsors of LASCON 2010!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
President
Austin OWASP
