Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] No February meeting,
	but consider the Feb ISSA meeting
Message-ID: <A159EC70B84EFB43B0EAC68C9FEC16DA011DB662BEAA@VA3DIAXVS111.RED001.local>

All:

Thanks to everyone who came to the January meeting with Matt Tesauro.  What a turnout!

OWASP San Antonio doesn't have a meeting scheduled for February (although we are planning on monthly meetings starting in March), but I would recommend folks consider going to the ISSA meeting on  Feb 16th, 2010:
<http://alamo.issa.org/nextmeeting.asp>

The topic is "Information Security Breach Disclosure"  Hopefully no one ever needs this information, but I have a suspicion some of you out there might.

So OWASP will be back on in March.  For February - please take a look at the ISSA meeting.

Thanks,

Dan
