*September OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting*


*When*: September 25th, 11:30am-1:00pm

11:45 AM - Chapter Announcements
12:00 PM - Presentation

*Topic:* Vulnerability Spidey Sense

A dedicated attacker does not have time limitations when attempting to find
vulnerabilities in a target. As a penetration tester, you are bound by
certain restrictions, including scope, attack methods, and time/date
restrictions. Because of these restrictions, it's helpful to prioritize
certain targets over others to increase your chances of breaking in. This
talk will cover scenarios which raise red flags for us, why, and how to
develop your own sense of intuition.

San Antonio OWASP Chapter: 
Tuesday, September 25, 2012
Topic: Dev/Ops, Continuous Deployment and APIs, Oh My!
Presenter: Jarret Raim and Matt Tesauro
Date: Tuesday, September 25, 2012
Time: 11:30am-1:00pm

Abstract: As the world of application development continues to change, the security community needs to change with it. With agile development, continuous deployment, the pace of change in IT has only increased. Add in Dev/Ops and the traditional security processes just don?t work. Even if testing windows exist, they are too short for the traditional scanning or manual testing programs. Then, there?s the lack of viable tools to test API?s. What?s a security professional in charge of rolling out an SDLC supposed to do? This talk will cover methods of adapting traditional security practices into a test driven development (TDD) for security and provide practical advice on how to handle short development and promotion cycles with few or no testing windows. A demonstration of a new testing tool will also be part of the presentation.
