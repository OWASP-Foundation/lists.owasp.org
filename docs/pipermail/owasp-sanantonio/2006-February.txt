San Antonio OWASP Chapter: February 2006 Meeting
Topic: The Second Most Secure Database
Presenter: Dan Cornell of Denim Group, Ltd.
Date: February 16th, 2006 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)

Abstract:
The most secure database server is one that is turned off, disconnected
from the network, and sealed in cement.  Unfortunately this database is
not terribly useful.  In the real world the database must be turned on,
on the network, and processing queries.  This presentation will explore
the threats to databases and discuss technologies and techniques for
mitigating these risks.  This will include a STRIDE-based threat model
for a typical database server backing a web application and specific
examples will be explored for both Microsoft's SQL Server 2005 and MySQL
5.0.

Presenter Bio:
Dan Cornell is a Principal of the Denim Group, a Texas-based consultancy
providing software development and application security services.  He
has extensive experience architecting and developing enterprise web
applications on a variety of platforms as well as training and mentoring
development teams on application security and secure coding techniques.
He is an MCSD as well as a Java 2 Certified Programmer.

Sodas and snacks will be provided.  Feel free to bring a brown-bag
lunch.
