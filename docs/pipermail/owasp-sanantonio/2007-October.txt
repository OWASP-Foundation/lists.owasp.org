San Antonio OWASP Chapter: October 2007 Meeting
Topic: Business Logic Flaws
Presenter: Jeremiah Grossman
Date: October 11th, 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)
3463 Magic Drive
San Antonio, TX 78229

Abstract:
Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are
just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that
malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. These types
of vulnerabilities are routinely overlooked during QA because the
process is intended to test what a piece of code is supposed to do and
not what it can be made to do. The other problem(s) with business logic
flaws is scanners can't identify them, IDS can't detect them, and Web
application firewalls can't defend them. Hard hitting trifecta. Plus,
the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more
prone it is to have flaws in business logic.

As the number of common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and
Cross-Site Scripting are reduced, the bad guys will increase their
attacks on business logic flaws.

This presentation will provide real-world demonstrations of how
pernicious and dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a
website. We'll also show how best to spot them and provide organizations
with a simple and rational game plan to prevent them.
