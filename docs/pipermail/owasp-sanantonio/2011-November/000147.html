<PRE>All:

Please come see Steve Werby from UTSA talk about leaking sensitive data at the OWASP San Antonio November meeting.  This is a similar talk to what was presented at LASCON recently for folks who weren't able to attend. More details below.  Bring a friend - FREE LUNCH!

Thanks,

Dan


=======================

San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, November 16, 2011

Topic: You're Bleeding Sensitive Data - Find it Before They Do

Presenter: Steve Werby

Date: Wednesday, November 16, 2011

Time: 11:30am-1:00pm

Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room) 3463 Magic Drive San Antonio, TX 78229 <A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229</A>


Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet accessible applications and files within organizations and the number of employees capable of making sensitive content available growing rapidly, knowing what sensitive information is accessible is increasingly difficult. And expensive DLP and scanning tools are not the only option. I will cover management strategies to reduce the risk, as well as demonstrate free and low-cost tools (FOCA, Shodan, Google Hacking Database and more) to discover sensitive data.


Presenter Bio: Steve Werby is Chief Information Security Officer at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where he leads the university's 10-person Office of Information Security. He has also served as CISO for Virginia Commonwealth University and the Virginia Department of Corrections (where he gained a new appreciation for physical security). Prior to that, he operated an information security consultancy with an international client base consisting largely of ISPs, web hosting companies and online businesses. Steve has an engineering degree, an MBA and numerous certs, but he is prouder of the fact that he hasn't signed his name the same way twice since 2009.


Lunch will be provided.

Please RSVP: E-mail <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-sanantonio">owasprsvp at denimgroup.com</A> or call (210) 572-4400.
