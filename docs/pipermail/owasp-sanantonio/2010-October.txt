Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Last Call for LASCON (10/29/2010)
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=RkkUqz9ghOfCr8XE3J_KKuYDO-njRXcupmh5d@mail.gmail.com>

Texas OWASP Members,

This e-mail is our Last Call for LASCON registration.  The first-ever
Lonestar Application Security Conference is happening at the Norris
Conference Center in Austin, TX a week from Friday on October 29, 2010.
It's a full-day conference that features some of the top security
researchers from around the world.  It doesn't matter if you're a manager or
a techie or somewhere in-between, LASCON has something for you.

Since most of you on this list are coming from out-of-town, I wanted to
mention a couple of things.  First, there will be a reception immediately
following the conference from 5-7 PM.  We have solidified a sponsor for the
event which means that this will truly be an event to remember.  Please
stick around after the conference to attend.  Second, if you need hotel
accomodations, we have a discounted conference rate of $139 at the Embassy
Suites Arboretum and some people have made reservations at the Hotel
Allandale that is literally right next door to the Norris Conference
Center.  Please let me know if I can provide assistance.

Until next Tuesday (10/26/2010) you can still receive a significant discount
on your LASCON registration.  It's only $100 for OWASP members and $150 for
non-members (includes 1 year OWASP membership).  On Tuesday the price goes
up to a $200 flat rate for everyone through to the conference.  We have less
than 60 available spots left until we can't take anyone else and these
remaining passes are going very quickly.  I promise that this will be the
security conference that everyone will be talking about for the next year to
come.  Don't miss out!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol

LASCON Co-Chair &
Austin OWASP President
