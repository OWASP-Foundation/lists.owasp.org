Title: Using Instrumentation and Sensors to drive Optimization in your Application Security Program

Abstract:
In our physical world, we have instrumentation all around us. Clocks tell us time, kitchen ovens tell us temperature, cars tell us speed and fuel level, and even have onboard health diagnostics. At our homes, we have security alerts when someone trespasses our property or opens a door. However, in the world of software, we have very little visibility into what is going on inside the software. Our presenters will describe how instrumentation can be used to enable your software applications to both detect vulnerabilities and block attacks.  Furthermore, they will demonstrate the insights offered by using instrumentation and why this approach can offer unique insights to your security program.

Speaker: Girish Nair
