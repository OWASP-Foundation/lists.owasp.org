Hey Texas OWASPers!

One of the OWASP Global Board Members, Tobias Gondrom, is helping to
promote an OWASP project called the OWASP CISO Survey.  Your response will
be kept completely anonymous, it only takes a few minutes of time, and by
completing it, you are helping to shape the future of Internet and software
security.  The aggregated results will be publicly available in the form of
a free report available on owasp.org.  He is currently short on responses
from the USA and I told him that I would try to help by reaching out to our
amazing Texas OWASPers.  If you wouldn't mind completing it, he would
greatly appreciate it.  More information is below.  Thank you!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
OWASP Global Board Member

problems of the future that you face.
