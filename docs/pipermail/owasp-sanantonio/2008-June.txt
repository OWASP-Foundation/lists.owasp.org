Top Ten Strategies to Secure Your Code
Presented by Michael Howard, Principal Security Program Manager at
Microsoft Corp.

Many people think security knowledge is out of their grasp and that such
expertise belongs only to the security high-priesthood. First, there is
no such thing as a "security high-priesthood"; all software developers
should have some security expertise. Second, regardless of the
programming languages you use, or the operating systems you deploy on,
there are some very simple rules you can follow that will help secure
your applications.

Come listen to Michael's thoughts on how to secure code based on his
work with thousands of software developers inside and outside Microsoft.
There are, of course, plenty of security war stories!
