<PRE>All:

The March OWASP San Antonio meeting is TOMORROW Wednesday March 23rd, 2011.  This is going to be a good one - we have Michael Coates from Mozilla presenting remotely (via Skype) about self-defending web applications.  This is based on his work on the OWASP AppSensor project and should be really interesting.  See below for details - hope to see everyone there and please feel free to bring a friend or colleague.

Also - FREE LUNCH (!!)

Thanks,

Dan

Abstract:
Attack Aware Applications:
Imagine being able to detect an attacker in your application while they are searching for vulnerability and then locking out their account before they can do any harm.  The OWASP AppSensor project provides a strategy for enabling your applications to detect and respond to attackers in real time.  More powerful then generic detection with a WAF, the AppSensor approach allows detection of targeted application attacks attempting to exploit all areas including: business logic, access control, session management, injection attacks and more.  This presentation will discuss techniques for implementing such a system within your application using existing technologies or by leveraging ESAPI.

Presenter Bio:

Michael holds a MS in Computer Security from DePaul University and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Illinois.
