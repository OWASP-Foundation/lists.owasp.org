Abstract:
What do you do when the dust settles after a web application assessment
or penetration test?  You know you have applications with
vulnerabilities and you know your organization is exposed to risks.  How
do you go about addressing these risks while still making progress on an
already aggressive development schedule?  What issues need to be fixed
and which can be ignored until later.

This presentation will discuss strategies for organizations remediating
vulnerable web applications.  It focuses on practical concerns for
planning and executing a successful remediation effort.
*	Classifying risks and ranking the severity of web application
vulnerabilities using tools such as STRIDE and DREAD
*	Making challenging tradeoff decisions about which
vulnerabilities to address and which risks to live with
*	Planning and executing remediation tasks and integrating these
with existing project plans and timelines
*	Integrating lessons learned from the assessment and remediation
back into your organization's SDLC
