All:

Many of the materials on the OWASP Wiki are now available in
actual-printed-book form.  See the message below.

Also I will shortly be sending out an email about new benefits of
becoming an OWASP member <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership>
These have been beefed up and I had the opportunity to meet with Dinis
and other OWASP leaders at the San Jose conference to talk about this.
More info to come.

Thanks,

Dan

GOT OWASP BOOKS?

Many of you have read the wiki used the OWASP published materials as
guides such as the Top 10 Guide, Testing Guide, CLASP for lifecyle and
many others

That may work for some of us g33ks however management likes to kill
trees
(well not all of them right..) but like a hard copy printed book as a
"blueprint" of how something should be done or as a ref., or to give to
a
employee and say "read this"

Well OWASP has done just that - all our books are now hardcopy
published!

I am pleased to announce to the NYC Metro local chapter and shortly it
will be announced to the world of OWASP Books online - so order now
before
the holiday rush ;)

Now you can get a professional bound book that you can give away to your
managers,developers,pen testers,audit department to help spread the
word.

Online bookstore = http://stores.lulu.com/owasp

Shirts hats etc... http://www.cafepress.com/owasp

If you forget the links you can always go back to the wiki at
http://www.owasp.org to find them.

Dinis is also working on a buy a book, plant a tree program since we are
in a GREEN World ;)
