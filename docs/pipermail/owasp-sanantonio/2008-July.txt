Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] OWASP Certification Survey
Message-ID: <4122F6F18CC18A4FBE1DCBA11348F0AB012BD5AF@satmail.denimgroup.com>

San Antonio OWASP folks:

There are some folks within OWASP looking to create OWASP certifications for web application security professionals.  They have put together an online survey to gauge interest as well as try to work through potential details.

The survey is online here:
<http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=mPXlkuSXdePFRiS79VL8Sg_3d_3d>

If you have a minute, please fill this out with your opinions.

Thanks,

Dan

Security and Privacy in an Online Vehicle Infrastructure
Presented by Erhan J. Kartaltepe, MCPD, Lead Consultant at Denim Group,
Ltd.

Technologies such as GPS, high-speed wireless access, and the
federally-funded Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) initiative are
used and accepted by corporations and government entities. As businesses
and public sector agencies provide more of these web-accessible services
to individual consumers, new and familiar security pitfalls abound. This
presentation covers current security threats and defenses, as well as
recent applied research in securing these multimillion dollar
infrastructures.
