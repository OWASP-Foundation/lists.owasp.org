Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] OWASP San Antonio: Meeting Jan 31
Message-ID: <4122F6F18CC18A4FBE1DCBA11348F0AB0210F333@satmail.denimgroup.com>

All:

Sorry that OWASP San Antonio has been quiet for a couple of months over
the holidays.  Things should be heating back up and we are now kicking
off what will hopefully be a great 2008.

Our first meeting will be Thursday Jan 31 at the San Antonio Tech Center
and the topic will be "Static Analysis Techniques for Testing
Application Security" 

More details are below.  I hope to see everyone there and please bring a
friend!

Thanks,

Dan

San Antonio OWASP Chapter: January 2008 Meeting
Topic: Static Analysis Techniques for Testing Application Security
Presenter: Dan Cornell
Date: January 31st, 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)

Abstract:
Static Analysis of software refers to examining source code and other
software artifacts without executing them.   This presentation looks at
how these techniques can be used to identify security defects in
applications.  Approaches examined will range from simple keyword search
methods used to identify calls to banned functions through more
sophisticated data flow analysis used to identify more complicated
issues such as injection flaws.  In addition, a demonstration will be
given of two freely-available static analysis tools: FindBugs for the
Java platform and FXCop for the .NET platform.  Finally, some approaches
will be presented on how organizations can start using static analysis
tools as part of their development and quality assurance processes.
