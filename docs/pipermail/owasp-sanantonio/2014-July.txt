Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] FREE LASCON tickets
Message-ID: <CFFF075F.21836A%dan@denimgroup.com>

All:

First of all I want to apologize for being possibly the worst OWASP
Chapter Leader available in 2014. I need to get some speakers lined up and
get some meetings on the calendar. Anyone who wants to help me get that
lined up - please reach out.


On a better note, the good folks at OWASP Austin are running LASCON 2014
this year on October 23rd and 24th. Check out the website for more details:
http://lascon.org/


Just like last year, we have a free discount code available to OWASP San
Antonio folks. Use the code: SA_LASCON14
The first 10 folks to use it will get registration FREE (FREE!). If you
run into any trouble let me know and I can help run it down.


Again - my apologies for the horribly lacking meeting schedule this year.
I'm working to get a couple on the books. In the meantime - sign up for
LASCON!


Thanks,

Dan
