Howdy folks,

Have you heard about the conference OWASP Austin is hosting from November
1st - 4th?   We have been putting on LASCON for a few years now and there
are tickets still available, but only for a couple more days.  From
November 3rd - 4th, come see the 50+ speakers on a variety of application
security topics from programming language security to application
penetration testing practices to architecture discussions.  Many vendors
and other job opportunities will also be there... and a mechanical bull!
