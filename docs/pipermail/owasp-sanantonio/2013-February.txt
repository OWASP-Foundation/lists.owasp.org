Abstract:

By now pretty much everyone has heard of "big data", right? If not,
here's Wikipedia's short summary: "big data is a collection of data sets
so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand
database management tools or traditional data processing applications."
Did you ever wonder how big data affects security? Or why the "bad guys"
are still winning? The industry invests large amounts of money and
energy in protecting assets via the use of firewalls, WAF, IDS/IPS, AV,
etc., but is it really working? Come and join Lars Ewe, VP of
Engineering at Click Security, a leader in the big data real-time
security analytics (RtSA) space, to learn more about how big data RtSA
can help you catch the "bad guys" by better leveraging your existing
security infrastructure investments.
