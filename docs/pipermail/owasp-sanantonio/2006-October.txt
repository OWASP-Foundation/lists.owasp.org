All:

I just got back from the OWASP AppSec 2006 conference in Seattle and it
was a great time.  Lots of excellent discussions about new and exciting
application security topics.

I wanted to check with the folks on this list and see if there were any
topic requests or volunteers who wanted to present as we closed out 2006
and rolled into 2007.

Also, Denim Group's sprajax project has been donated to OWASP.  Check
out the new home page here: <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Sprajax> and
please sign up for the mailing list.

Thanks,

Dan
