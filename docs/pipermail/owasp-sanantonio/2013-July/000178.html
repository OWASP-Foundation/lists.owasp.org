<PRE>All right sorry I'm bad at the Internet. I sent that last email out
half-composed. Here's the actual intended full email.



All:

Matt Tesauro's slides from his &quot;Secrets-as-a-Service&quot; presentation
yesterday are online:
<A HREF="https://owasp.org/index.php/File:Secrets-as-a-Service.pdf">https://owasp.org/index.php/File:Secrets-as-a-Service.pdf</A>
Many thanks to Matt for coming to present.


Also for those of you who might be interested (and may not have been at
yesterday's
meeting) I wanted to reiterate that if you are an OWASP Member based here
in San Antonio, OWASP San Antonio will cover the cost of your training if
you want to attend any of the pre-LASCON training events. Currently I am
scheduled to give a course titled &quot;Running a Software Security Program
with Open Source Tools&quot; on July 22nd and 23rd in Austin. More info:
<A HREF="http://lascon.org/training/pre-conference-training-running-a-software-secur">http://lascon.org/training/pre-conference-training-running-a-software-secur</A>
ity-program-with-open-source-tools/

Matt Tesauro will be running another pre-LASCON course in September that
teaches web application testing with OWASP's WTE (Web Testing Environment)
This will also include some new material on testing REST web services. I
will send along a link once the dates on that are locked down.

If you are an OWASP Member based here in San Antonio and you are
interested in attending either/both courses for free send me an email and
I will work to get you registered.

*** PLEASE NOTE *** I don't get paid more if we have more folks in my
course so this isn't a scheme to line my pockets with OWASP San Antonio
money. Instead this is a way to hopefully use some of the funds that we
have allocated to OWASP San Antonio for the benefit of the OWASP San
Antonio community. If you have any questions please let me know.


Thanks,

Dan
