San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, January 19, 2011

Topic: Smart Phones with Dumb Apps

Presenter: Dan Cornell

Date: Wednesday, January 19, 2011

Time: 11:30am-1:00pm

Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room) 3463 Magic Drive San Antonio, TX 78229 <A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229</A>


Abstract: Enterprises are targeting both internal users and customers with smartphone applications for platforms such as Apple iPhone and Google Android. Many of these applications are constructed without fully considering the associated security implications of their deployment. Breaches can impact both users as well as the enterprise distributing the application as attackers take advantage of expanded access to sensitive data and network services. This talk discusses emerging threats associated with deploying smartphone applications and provides an overview of the threat modeling process. The presentation then walks example applications from an attacker's perspective demonstrating the sort of information they are able to extract allowing for more advanced attacks.
