San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, January 19, 2011

Topic: Smart Phones with Dumb Apps

Presenter: Dan Cornell

Date: Wednesday, January 19, 2011

Time: 11:30am-1:00pm

Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room) 3463 Magic Drive San Antonio, TX 78229 http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229


Abstract: Enterprises are targeting both internal users and customers with smartphone applications for platforms such as Apple iPhone and Google Android. Many of these applications are constructed without fully considering the associated security implications of their deployment. Breaches can impact both users as well as the enterprise distributing the application as attackers take advantage of expanded access to sensitive data and network services. This talk discusses emerging threats associated with deploying smartphone applications and provides an overview of the threat modeling process. The presentation then walks example applications from an attacker's perspective demonstrating the sort of information they are able to extract allowing for more advanced attacks.

Presenter Bio: Dan Cornell has over ten years of experience architecting and developing web-based software systems. As CTO of Denim Group, he leads the organization's technology team overseeing methodology development and project execution for Denim Group's customers. He also heads the Denim Group security research team, investigating the application of secure coding and development techniques to the improvement of web-based software development methodologies.

Dan Cornell has performed as the CTO of BrandDefense, as founder and Vice President of Engineering for Atension prior to its acquisition by Rare Medium, Inc. and as the Vice President, Global Competency Leader for Rare Medium's Java and Unix Competency Center. Cornell has also developed simulation applications for the Air Force with Southwest Research Institute.

Dan was the founding coordinator and chairman for the Java Users Group of San Antonio (JUGSA) and is currently the chapter leader of the San Antonio chapter of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). He is a recognized expert in the area of web application security for SearchSoftwareQuality.com and the primary author of Sprajax, Denim Group's open source tool for assessing the security of AJAX-enabled web applications.
