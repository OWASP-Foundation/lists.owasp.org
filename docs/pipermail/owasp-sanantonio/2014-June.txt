Hey OWASP San Antonio,

I will be heading down to SA on July 10th to do a free training for the
Alamo ISSA chapter.  The training is called "Risk Management Like a Boss:
Making Your Risks Work for You" and covers basic risk management activities
along with my free and open source risk management tool, SimpleRisk.
Here's a link:

http://www.eventbrite.com/e/risk-management-seminar-tickets-11746497089

The opportunity is open to the first 50 people who register (38 spots
currently remain).  There's a $10 fee at registration which should be
refunded back to you after you attend the event.  I hope to see you there!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
