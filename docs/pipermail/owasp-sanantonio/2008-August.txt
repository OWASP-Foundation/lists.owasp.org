Django and the OWASP Top 10
Presented by Jarret Raim, Team Consultant at Denim Group, Ltd.

with a short introduction to Django, its goals, architecture and theory.
It will then move on to the explicit and implicit security features of
the framework and how they relate to the OWASP Top 10. No prior
knowledge of Django or Python is required.
