Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Call for Speakers
Message-ID: <CAPaN4rYZkx4EZ9WO_QqnNQaL7POO5676+6vxhFefTqwf1A_y8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All:

We hope you were able to take advantage of the free passes that the kind
folks at Innotech graciously provided last month.

As we reach May's half-way mark, we wanted to extend a call for members on
the list who would like to speak at a chapter meeting, or know of someone
who might want to speak. Chapter meetings typically last about an hour, so
the length can be from 30-45 minutes and take the form of:

   - A presentation (team or individual)
   - A panel discussion
   - A hands-on lab
   - Others...

The topic could include any of the following.

   - Threats/Countermeasures (malware, social or reverse engineering, etc.)
   - Secure Development (conceptual or specific language)
   - Tools (encryption, scanners, methodologies, etc.)
   - Incident Response (management, preventions, detection, recovery, etc.)
   - Others...

It would even help to know what specific topics you'd be interested in
hearing about.

Our hope is to get a good queue of folks lined up to present and you all
can help make that happen.

Feel free to reply to all, or directly to me.

Thanks for all your help!

Matt Valdes
OWASP San Antonio Chapter Co-leader

Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Mobile app assessment stats talk next Friday
Message-ID: <D18483BD.3682F9%dan@denimgroup.com>

All:

I'll be speaking about mobile application security assessment statistics
next Friday (May 29) at the next OWASP San Antonio meeting. Meetup link is
here:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-San-Antonio/events/222536787/


This will be at the Denim Group offices. Hope to see folks there. Bring
friends - FREE LUNCH!


Title: Application Security Assessments By The Numbers: A Whole-Istic View

Abstract:
By analyzing the data from over 60 mobile application security
assessments, we identify the typical types of mobile vulnerabilities, the
system components that contain those vulnerabilities, the components where
given types of vulnerabilities cluster, and how to test for each of these.
Attendees will learn in the session how to identify these vulnerabilities,
how to create and implement an effective mobile security plan, and where
to focus their limited testing resources to minimize mobile application
portfolio risks. This is critical because automated web application
testing tools are able to easily find vulnerabilities while today?s mobile
security industry does not offer automated testing tools that can
effectively test web services (i.e. the interaction between mobile clients
and back-end services.) As a result, best practices for mobile application
testing must incorporate significant, often laborious, manual testing. At
this point in the presentation, we will use the statistics from the
research to define the appropriate manual testing that needs to be
implemented.
 




Thanks,

Dan

Just a quick note to let the San Antonio Chapter know about an upcoming
event:

(ISC)2 SecureSDLC day in Austin

Friday June 12 from 9 AM to 5 PM

Summary:
http://www.cvent.com/events/-isc-2-securesdlc-austin2015/event-summary-7702da885b9e4508ba878b4aad85c75c.aspx

Come see some Texas AppSec pro's speak on the theme ?Software Security ?
Moving from Prescriptive to Pragmatic.?

Speakers include:

   - Michael Howard
   - Mano Paul
   - Dan Cornell
   - Phil Beyer
   - James Wickett
   - Matt Tesauro (sorry, shameless self-promotion)

Agenda:
http://www.cvent.com/events/-isc-2-securesdlc-austin2015/agenda-7702da885b9e4508ba878b4aad85c75c.aspx

FYI:  I'll be speaking about using open source tools to construct your own
AppSec Pipeline to add DevOps and Automation to your internal security
program.  This is something we're actively doing where I work and I'll talk
about both the key requirements as well as how we've specifically created
our own AppSec Pipeline.  I'll also discuss where you can get these open
source tools/projects to super-charge your AppSec program.

Hope to see you there.

Cheers!

Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] hardwear.io - Hardware Security Conference Call
	for Papers
Message-ID: <CAMUeWmggKhuXm1qxD8S4hqB43zyJ7959DVtUc=P3RSXO+Rwnww@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Hackers and Security Gurus,

hardwear is seeking innovative research on hardware security. If you
have done interesting research on attacks or mitigation on any
Hardware and want to showcase it to the security community, just
submit your research paper. Please find all the relevant details for
the submission below.

About hardwear.io
----------------------------
Somewhere in the mid of last year, amidst all the news and concerns
surrounding trust and backdoors in hardware equipment, Hardwear was
conceptualized to provide the IT and security community with a
platform to discuss and solve issues pertaining to hardware security.
The objective of the conference revolves around four key concerns in
hardware, firmware and related protocols i.e. backdoors, exploits,
trust and attacks (BETA).

Dates:
Training: 29th - 39th Sept 2015
Conference: 1-2nd Oct 2015

Venue:
The Hague, Netherlands

General Queries: antriksh at hardwear.io
CFP Queries:      cfp at hardwear.io


Topics
-----------
hardwear accepts papers on any topic that discusses in-depth hardware
and firmware security both from the offensive as well as defensive
perspective. Some of the topics of interest include (but not limited
to):

- Integrated Circuits
- Processors
- Internet of Things/Smart Devices
- Hardware crypto
- Embedded Systems
- Automobile, Aeroplane, train automation systems and hardware components
- Industrial Control Systems/SCADA Systems

- Smartphone firmware, hardware
- Firmware
- Hardware pentesting
- Trusted Platform Module
- Radio communication Protocols and hardware
- Trust and assurance algorithms
- Multimedia hardware, firmware, protocols
- Telecom Hardware/Networks
- Electronic/Physical Locks

Categories
---------------------------
1. New Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? is a deep knowledge technical track
that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased before, it will fall under current research
category even though there are enhancements/changes to the original
research.

2. Current Research (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Submission Format
------------------------------
Email the paper to: cfp at hardwear.io
The subject should be: CFP EU 2015 <Paper Title>
Email Body:
Name
Handle
Talk Category (Mentioned above i.e. research/technical/tool)
Time required (including 5-10 mins of QA)

Organization and Designation
Contact Number
Have you presented or submitted this paper at any other conference(s)
or magazine(s)?
Yes, No.
If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the previous
ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or are due
to be given elsewhere prior to hardwear will be considered as current
research category talks unless they consist of cutting edge and ground
breaking technology, which is at the judgment of the review committee.

Are you releasing an open source hardware(or specification)?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the design for review)

Are you releasing an exploit?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the source and vulnerability details for review)

Are you releasing a new vulnerability/Zero-day?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please send us the details, including reproduction procedure,
for review)

Why do you think your paper is different/innovative and how does it
qualify as new work/research(for new Research category only)?

Are there any live demonstrations (These earn you good points during review)?
Yes/No.
(If Yes, how many? Also please explain each demo)

Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

Paper Abstract ? Please provide detailed working or your
research/work. The more details you provide the better it is for the
reviewers. Please keep the abstract to the point. Please do not try to
hide the technical details or say ?I can?t disclose it till bla bla?
as it does not help the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a
low score because of insufficient information available in the
abstract.
Your high resolution photo (attached)
Note
-------------------------
Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected. The Abstract should
clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail and merely
