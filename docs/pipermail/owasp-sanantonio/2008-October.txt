Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Call for Logos - SnowFROC
Message-ID: <70613.87978.qm@web405.biz.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi All - we're putting together a Front-Range OWASP Conference for March 5th in Denver, CO.  We're
calling it SnowFROC and we're hoping to make it a fantastic annual event.

A fantastic event needs a fantastic logo.  Please help by creating a logo and sending a jpeg to
Kathy Thaxton at kthaxton at businesspartnersolutions and to me at owasp at justplainpix.com with a
subject line "Logo contest" and your contact info.  If you're not "the artistic type" but you know
someone who is, please forward this message on.

Here are some examples.  I'd REALLY like to have something of the same quality - please help!

http://www.owasp.org/images/c/cb/OWASP_EU_Summit_Portugal_2008.jpg

What does the winner get?  At this point I can guarantee that the winner will be recognized during
SnowFROC as well as on the SnowFROC site and both Chapter websites.  I can promise we'll try to do
something else special for the winner but can't guarantee what that will be (stay tuned).

Note:  if you are interested in volunteering to be on the Panel of Judges please contact me or
Kathy Thaxton (Events Director, cc:'d on this message)

Thanks and good luck!
Andy

Ensuring System Security Using Data Flow Analysis
Presented by Jeremy Price, Senior Research Engineer at Southwest
Research Institute (SwRI)

Ensuring computer system security using user defined policies is a
difficult problem.  One approach that is currently being researched is
the application of system-level data flow analysis to ensure malicious
code cannot infiltrate the system.  

The data flow analysis involved with ensuring system security needs two
levels of granularity: inter-process data flow analysis and
intra-process data flow analysis.  The University of Texas at Austin
Department of Computer Science has created a Dynamic Data Flow Analysis
(DDFA) tool that implements intra-process data flow analysis.  Purdue
University has created a Process Coloring (PC) system that implements
the inter-process data flow analysis.  Southwest Research Institute is
working with both universities to integrate the PC and DDFA technologies
to implement the system level data flow analysis solution.  This talk
will focus on technical details of the two different technologies and
will detail example security scenarios that can be solved using these
technologies.
