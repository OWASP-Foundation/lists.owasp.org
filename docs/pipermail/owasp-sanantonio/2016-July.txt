Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] No July Meeting
Message-ID: <CAPaN4rZTHPTxdL+zH4ED8F7o0UWyEQ9+4PrcbwZs8Ac-dWCbYg@mail.gmail.com>

All:

As you may have guessed, there will be no OWASP San Antonio meeting for
July.

We are looking for speakers and/or topics to round out the remainder of the
year, so feel free to send references or suggestions.

See you all next month!

Matt
