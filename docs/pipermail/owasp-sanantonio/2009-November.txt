Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Who is headed to AppSec 2009 in DC?
Message-ID: <A159EC70B84EFB43B0EAC68C9FEC16DA011B600B281D@VA3DIAXVS111.RED001.local>

All:

Who all is headed to AppSec 2009 in Washington DC next week?  There is still time to register: <http://appsecdc.org/>

I wanted to get an idea of who from the Texas crew was headed to DC.  We should meet up at the Thursday happy hour.  I'll buy the first round :)

Hope folks can make it.  This is shaping up to be a great conference.

Thanks,

Dan
