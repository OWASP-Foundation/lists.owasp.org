Subject: [Owasp-sanantonio] Inaugural OWASP San Antonio meeting - Feb 11th
Message-ID: <D0F82727.2D5052%dan@denimgroup.com>

All:

I might not be the worst Chapter Leader in OWASP history, but in 2014 I
certainly did my best to earn that honor. BUT with help from some folks
we're looking to get 2015 off on a better foot.

The first OWASP San Antonio meeting of 2015 will be Feb 11th at the new
Denim Group offices located at 1604 and 281 (** no more San Antonio
Technology Center **) The address is:
Denim Group
1354 N Loop 1604 E, Suite 110
San Antonio, Texas 78232


The presentation will be from Charles Neill from Rackspace on BeEF - the
Browser Exploitation Framework Project. We'll be sending along a more
specific abstract shortly.

We're going to start using MeetUp for our events so please RSVP there.
That has worked really well for a number of other OWASP chapters. The
MeetUp link for our first 2015 meeting is here:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-San-Antonio/events/220312744/



Also please mark you calendars - we are looking at having a FULL DAY EVENT
at Rackspace on FRIDAY MARCH 20th. More details of that will be
forthcoming but we wanted folks to block off that day. We're currently
working on the program, etc but it should be a fun day with a lot of great
content.


Thanks,

Dan

Title: Introduction to Cross-Site Scripting with BeEF

Speaker: Charles Neill

Bio: Charles is a Security Developer at Rackspace, where he does
application security for products developed in-house, as well as
OpenStack projects and other third-party products. He also develops
tools to assist with security testing.

Abstract:
Cross-site scripting is a well-known attack vector at this
point, but many people still don't understand the full risk of being
vulnerable to it. BeEF is a framework that combines lots of different
tools that can be useful to an attacker after finding a cross-site
scripting bug in a site. The purpose of this talk is to demonstrate the
potential severity of a cross-site scripting attack, leveraging BeEF to
trick the user in various ways and to try to get as much useful
information out of them as possible.



Thanks,

Dan
