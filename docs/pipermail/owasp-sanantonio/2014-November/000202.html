<PRE>Hey Texas OWASPers!

One of the OWASP Global Board Members, Tobias Gondrom, is helping to
promote an OWASP project called the OWASP CISO Survey.  Your response will
be kept completely anonymous, it only takes a few minutes of time, and by
completing it, you are helping to shape the future of Internet and software
security.  The aggregated results will be publicly available in the form of
a free report available on owasp.org.  He is currently short on responses
from the USA and I told him that I would try to help by reaching out to our
amazing Texas OWASPers.  If you wouldn't mind completing it, he would
greatly appreciate it.  More information is below.  Thank you!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
OWASP Global Board Member

=======================================

Dear CISO colleague and security manager,

as a respected information security leader in the industry, OWASP (Open Web
Application Security Project, www.owasp.org) would like to hear your
opinion!

 *Link to take the CISO Survey 2014 now
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CISOSurvey2014</A>&gt;*

OWASP is preparing the Global CISO report 2014 and conducting a survey
among CISOs and senior information security managers in relation to
application security with the aim of providing you with new insights about
the state of application security across various industry sectors and about
new security trends and aligning our efforts to better help solving the
problems of the future that you face.

The survey shall take only a few minutes of your precious time and by
completing it you are helping shape the future of Internet and software
security. At the conclusion of the survey, the aggregated results will be
publicly available in the form of a free report on the owasp.org website,
keeping your information completely anonymous. (If you are interested, the
published results of the last CISO Survey Report 2013 can be found
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_CISO_Survey.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_CISO_Survey.</A>)  Deadline for
submission of the completed survey is *November 10th  2014*.

As you may know, OWASP is a volunteer open-source organization dedicated to
fighting the causes of software insecurity. We are also a registered
charity &amp; non-profit in the USA and the EU. See more at
