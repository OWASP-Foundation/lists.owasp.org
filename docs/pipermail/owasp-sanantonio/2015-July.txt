Hi All!

Thanks to everyone who made it out to the meeting today; especially Greg
for his enlightening look at CI/CD, and Denim Group for hosting.


The AppSecUSA team has graciously provided a $100 registration discount to
all OWASP chapters. Use the code US2015_TX when registering to receive the
discount.

TODAY IS THE LAST DAY TO USE THIS DISCOUNT!

A couple of our very own chapter members will be speaking and/or offering

useful information.
More info is available on the AppSecUSA 2015 site.

We hope to see you all again next month (8/28), where David Lister will be
taking a look at security implications of the Internet of Things - focusing
on Zigbee.

Let us know if you have any ideas for future chapter meetings in the
meantime.

Matt
