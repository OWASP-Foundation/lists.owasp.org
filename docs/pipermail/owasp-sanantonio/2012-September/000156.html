Abstract: As the world of application development continues to change, the security community needs to change with it. With agile development, continuous deployment, the pace of change in IT has only increased. Add in Dev/Ops and the traditional security processes just don&#8217;t work. Even if testing windows exist, they are too short for the traditional scanning or manual testing programs. Then, there&#8217;s the lack of viable tools to test API&#8217;s. What&#8217;s a security professional in charge of rolling out an SDLC supposed to do? This talk will cover methods of adapting traditional security practices into a test driven development (TDD) for security and provide practical advice on how to handle short development and promotion cycles with few or no testing windows. A demonstration of a new testing tool will also be part of the presentation.
