Who do you want to mash with? 
Trust infrastructures for Internet mashups
Presented by Ravi Ganesan

Part 1: The University of Texas at San Antonio is announcing a new
technology incubator focused on commercializing security and privacy
technologies. Highlights about the incubator and how to submit a
proposal will be described.

Part 2: Mashups are emerging as a very important web application
architecture paradigm. Developers (or even the users themselves) can
assemble a uber app that mashes data and code from myriad sources. This
talk will first explore the emerging world of mashups and highlight the
security problems that are raised, and motivate the need for a mashup
trust infrastructure. It will then describe MashSSL a technology that
can be used to solve several of the security problems of mashups.
