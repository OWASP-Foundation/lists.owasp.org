Title: Vision of the SWAMP

Abstract:
This Presentation is an overview of the Software Assurance Marketplace
(SWAMP) project. The SWAMP is a 23 Million dollar DHS funded initiative to
build a physical and virtual facility to help improve the quality of
software that is being designed, both open-source and proprietary. This
platform democratizes the SwA environment by providing a free, virtual
market where the user community can come to share tools, techniques,
resources and experiences with the goal of improving software assurance
(reducing software vulnerabilities)

More info about the meeting is is online here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/San_Antonio#Local_News

More info about the SWAMP can be found here:
http://www.cosalab.org/

As always the event is FREE (including FREE lunch) and we encourage you to
bring along any colleagues who might be interested. Hope to see folks
there.


Thanks,

Dan
