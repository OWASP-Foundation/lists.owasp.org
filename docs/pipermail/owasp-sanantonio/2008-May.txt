San Antonio OWASP Chapter: May 2008 Meeting 

Topic: A Sample PHP Implementation of Input Validation 

Presenter: Dan Ross 

Date: May 28th, 11:30am - 1:00pm 

Location: 

San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room) 3463 Magic Drive San Antonio, TX 78229 http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229 <http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229>  

Abstract: 

Over half of the OWASP Top Ten are caused by improper input validation. Failure to perform this crucial step is equivalent to malpractice. A sample implementation of input validation is presented using PHP. In addition to being simple to use, these tools also make it difficult to programmers to forget to address this subject. 

Also discussed will be: 

?  Tackling inherited programs which neglected input validation. 

?  How programs should respond to bad input. 

?  Stinger, and other open-source tools for other platforms.
