San Antonio OWASP Chapter: September 2007 Meeting
Topic: Developing an Application Security Strategy for Large Enterprise
Systems
Presenter: Bruce Jenkins, Fortify Software
Date: September 6th, 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)
3463 Magic Drive

Abstract:
Over the past decade, the Department of Defense in general, and the US
Air Force in particular, has transformed itself to better deal with 21st
century warfare. The Air Force in fact has modified its stated mission
to include cyberspace as one of the domains in which it will "fly and
fight." This type of shift in strategic thinking is critical for any
organization to properly acknowledge and manage real-world threats
against one of its most valuable assets: data.

Despite modernized mission statements and mindsets, organizations
continue to have difficulty implementing a course of action for dealing
with the threats against software systems serving up their data. It is
easy to talk about buying and implementing software security tools for
developers, QA testers and post-deployment operators; however, schedules
and budgets quickly go bust without consideration of the common
obstacles.

This presentation describes an application security strategy for large
enterprise systems-what to look out for, and what you must do to ensure
the successful rollout of the tools and services necessary to counter
the dark side of cyberspace.

Presenter Bio:
Major Bruce C. Jenkins, USAF (Ret.) is Security Practice Director at
Fortify Software, Inc., where his responsibilities include refining
customer security requirements, managing Fortify product deployments and
delivering security services.

Prior to joining Fortify, he spent 26 of his 28 years in the service
leading people, managing projects, and dealing with technological and
organizational change. His military experiences range from managing a
small team of aircraft avionics technicians to commanding a
communications unit supporting over 3,000 U.S. and international forces
in Southwest Asia. Most recently, as Chief of Systems Security, 554th
Electronic Systems Wing, he helped establish a nearly $13M budget for
creating the Air Force's first ever Center of Excellence for
applications security.

Bruce holds a BS in computer science from the University of Maryland and
MS in operations research from the Air Force Institute of Technology. He
is a Certified Ethical Hacker with countless hours of Internet surf
time, where he has learned that paranoia is a perfectly legitimate state
of mind.

Sodas and snacks will be provided. Feel free to bring a brown-bag lunch.

All:

I'm thrilled to announce that Jeremiah Grossman from WhiteHat Security
will be speaking at the OWASP San Antonio meeting in October.  We are
_extremely_ lucky to have such a well-known and well-respected speaker
at our chapter, so I hope to see everyone there.  I suspect attendance
will be pretty high, so please RSVP and bring anyone who might be
interested.

Thanks,

Dan

San Antonio OWASP Chapter: October 2007 Meeting
Topic: Business Logic Flaws
Presenter: Jeremiah Grossman
Date: October 11th, 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)
3463 Magic Drive
San Antonio, TX 78229
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+T
X+78229

Abstract:
Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are
just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that
malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. These types
of vulnerabilities are routinely overlooked during QA because the
process is intended to test what a piece of code is supposed to do and
not what it can be made to do. The other problem(s) with business logic
flaws is scanners can't identify them, IDS can't detect them, and Web
application firewalls can't defend them.  Hard hitting trifecta. Plus,
the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more
prone it is to have flaws in business logic.

As the number of common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and
Cross-Site Scripting are reduced, the bad guys will increase their
attacks on business logic flaws.

This presentation will provide real-world demonstrations of how
pernicious and dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a
website.  We'll also show how best to spot them and provide
organizations with a simple and rational game plan to prevent them.

Presenter Bio:
Jeremiah Grossman is the founder and CTO of WhiteHat Security and a
world-renowned expert in Web security.  He is also a co-founder of the
Web Application Security Consortium and was named one of InfoWorld's Top

including the Black Hat Briefings, RSA, CSI, ISACA, ISSA and Defcon.  He
is a co-author of Cross Site Scripting Attacks; has authored dozens of
articles and white papers; and is credited with the discovery of many
cutting-edge attack and defensive techniques. Mr. Grossman is a trusted
media resource and has been quoted in USA Today, CSO Magazine,
InfoWorld, PC World, Information Week, Dark Reading, SC Magazine, and
CNET. Prior to WhiteHat, he was an information security officer at
