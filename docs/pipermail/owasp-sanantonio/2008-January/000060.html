Abstract:
Static Analysis of software refers to examining source code and other
software artifacts without executing them. This presentation looks at
how these techniques can be used to identify security defects in
applications. Approaches examined will range from simple keyword search
methods used to identify calls to banned functions through more
sophisticated data flow analysis used to identify more complicated
issues such as injection flaws. In addition, a demonstration will be
given of two freely-available static analysis tools: FindBugs for the
Java platform and FXCop for the .NET platform. Finally, some approaches
will be presented on how organizations can start using static analysis
tools as part of their development and quality assurance processes.
