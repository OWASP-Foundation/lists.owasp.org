All:

The March OWASP San Antonio meeting will be next Wednesday March 23rd, 2011.  This is going to be a good one - we have Michael Coates from Mozilla presenting remotely (via Skype) about self-defending web applications.  This is based on his work on the OWASP AppSensor project and should be really interesting.  See below for details - hope to see everyone there and please feel free to bring a friend or colleague.

Thanks,

San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, March 23, 2011
Topic: Attack Aware Applications
Presenter: Michael Coates
Date: Wednesday, March 23, 2011

Abstract:
Attack Aware Applications:
Imagine being able to detect an attacker in your application while they are searching for vulnerability and then locking out their account before they can do any harm.  The OWASP AppSensor project provides a strategy for enabling your applications to detect and respond to attackers in real time.  More powerful then generic detection with a WAF, the AppSensor approach allows detection of targeted application attacks attempting to exploit all areas including: business logic, access control, session management, injection attacks and more.  This presentation will discuss techniques for implementing such a system within your application using existing technologies or by leveraging ESAPI.

Presenter Bio:
Michael Coates has extensive experience in application security, security code review and penetration assessments. He has conducted numerous security assessments for financial, enterprise and cellular customers worldwide.  Michael holds a MS in Computer Security from DePaul University and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Illinois.  

Michael is the creator and leader of the AppSensor project and a contributor to the 2010 OWASP Top 10. He is a frequent speaker at international OWASP security conferences and has also spoken at the Chicago Thotcon conference and provided security training at BlackHat.
