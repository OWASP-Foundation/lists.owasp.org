Security folks: Bring a developer.
Developers: Bring a security person.
Everyone: Come and eat FREE LUNCH!


Title: Taking AppSec to 11: AppSec Pipelines, DevOps and Making Things Better


Abstract:
How many applications are in your company&#8217;s portfolio? What&#8217;s the headcount for your AppSec team? Whatever your situation is, I am sure the numbers are not in your favor. Its not time to find a new career, it's time to up your game. This talk will cover how to take your small merry band of AppSec professionals and scale it up to a virtual army. By taking the best of DevOps, Agile and CI/CD, you can iteratively up your AppSec game over time and begin your ascent out of the security hole you are in.
The talk covers real world experiences running AppSec groups at two different companies. Rackspace with approximately 4,000+ employees and Pearson with 40,000+. Both have an international presence and far more apps and developers that AppSec staff. The talk covers the key principles to speed and scale up AppSec programs using an AppSec Pipeline as well as practical examples of these practices put into use. Start early and begin to buy down the technical security dept which feels inevitable with more traditional AppSec program thinking.
