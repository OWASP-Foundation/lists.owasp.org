San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wed March 17, 2010

Topic:  Protecting Your Applications: How to Secure Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors & Data Exfiltration

Presenter:  Clint Pollock from Veracode
Date: Wednesday, March 17th, 2010 11:30am - 1:00pm
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)
3463 Magic Drive
San Antonio, TX 78229

Abstract:

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and security of the software running its business critical applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers.

Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third party developers or are developing a COTS application for enterprise, your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and make applications security a priority for internal and external development teams.

In this session we will cover;
?    Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks
?    Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your applications
?    Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities
