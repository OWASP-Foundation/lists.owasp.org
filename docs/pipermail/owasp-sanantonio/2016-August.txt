Join us for the August OWASP San Antonio meeting!  

We will have a talk about Automated DNS Data Exfiltration and Mitigation .

Title: 

Automated DNS Data Exfiltration and Mitigation

Abstract: 

Come and learn about DNS based data exfiltration and see it in action.

We will cover the concepts, perform a live demo, and show you how to detect this type of malicious activity.
