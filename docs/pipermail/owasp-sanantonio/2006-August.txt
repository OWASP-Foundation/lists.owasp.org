San Antonio OWASP Chapter: August 2006 Meeting
Topic: Selecting a Single Sign-On Solution
Presenter: Vijay Kumar, technical lead, MSD Inc.
Date: Wednesday, August 23, 2006
Location:
San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)

San Antonio, TX 78229

Abstract:
Scattered software applications with differing security policies are a
bane of today's IT departments, consuming a large chunk of support and
maintenance budget. Single Sign-On is one of the technical controls
available to CIOs and CSOs for providing security in depth to a
corporation while reducing maintenance costs. In this talk I will
walk-through a typical SSO implementation from making a case for SSO to
deploying and maintaining the SSO process. Multiple SSO architectures
will be presented and merits and demerits of each of the architectures
will be discussed. Commercial offerings and open source SSO tools in
this space are also presented.


Presenter Bio:
Vijay Kumar is a software architect with 15+ years of design and
development experience in the retail, banking, insurance, and software
tools domain. He is currently working as a technical lead with MSD Inc
in Austin, TX. Prior to the current assignment, Vijay worked as an
Enterprise architect with Lockheed Martin IT and an Applications
Architect with Partnerware Inc.

Sodas and snacks will be provided. Feel free to bring a brown-bag
lunch.

Just wanted to give everyone a heads-up that the OWASP AppSec 2006
conference will be held on October 17th and 18th in Seattle (with a
training day on the 16th).  More information can be found here:
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006>

Denim Group folks will be giving two of the presentations (!)  I will be
presenting on sprajax and how it can be used to test AJAX security, and
Keith Landrus (Denim Group's Director of Technology) will be presenting
on integrating security into Agile development methodologies.  See the
agenda here:
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Seattle_2006/Agenda>

The conference are $450 with discounts for students and paid OWASP

Hopefully the San Antonio chapter will be well represented.

Thanks,

Dan
