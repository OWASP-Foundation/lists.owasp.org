San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, April 18, 2012

Topic: Secure Coding Practices for 2012
Presenter: Keith Turpin
Date: Wednesday, April 18, 2012
Time: 11:30am-1:00pm
Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room)
3463 Magic Drive
San Antonio, TX 78229

Abstract:

Keith Turpin will present OWASP's "The Secure Coding Practices Quick
Reference Guide." The guide is a technology agnostic set of software
security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist format, that can
be integrated into the development life-cycle. At only 17 pages long, it
is easy for development teams to read and use. The coding practices are
mapped to functional requirements, so you can quickly locate the practices
you need. It also provides a brief introduction to security principles and
vocabulary to help developers and security folks get on the same page, but
the focus is on requirements not vulnerabilities or exploits. This
presentation will provide an overview of the guide and discuss some
concepts about how to use it. Keith will cover the guide as well as the
direction of the project for 2012, and alignment with integrating
components of the guide with an organizations application security policy.

Just had a question about the chapter meeting being open to non-members. The answer is a resounding YES. Everyone is welcome and chapter meetings are free and open to all. Bring a friend!

Thanks
