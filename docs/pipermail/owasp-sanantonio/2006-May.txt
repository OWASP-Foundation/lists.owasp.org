San Antonio OWASP Chapter: May 2006 Meeting

Abstract:
By Forceful Browsing, clients may be able to access pages which should
be forbidden. A technique for preventing forceful browsing is
introduced. With this technique, you may be assured that clients may
only visit pages for which links have been presented.

Granularity may be adjusted for an entire page, as well as for specific
page parameters. For example, you may prevent a user from deleting
customers altogether, or you may permit a user to delete customer #1,
but not customer #2. In addition, a notification system can alert you
when users are forceful browsing.

The implementation will be presented using PHP.

Presenter Bio:
