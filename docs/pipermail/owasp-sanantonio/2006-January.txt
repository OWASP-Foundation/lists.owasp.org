Abstract:
The most secure database server is one that is turned off, disconnected
from the network, and sealed in cement.  Unfortunately this database is
not terribly useful.  In the real world the database must be turned on,
on the network, and processing queries.  This presentation will explore
the threats to databases and discuss technologies and techniques for
mitigating these risks.  This will include a STRIDE-based threat model
for a typical database server backing a web application and specific
examples will be explored for both Microsoft's SQL Server 2005 and MySQL
5.0.
