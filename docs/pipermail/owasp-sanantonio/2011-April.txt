San Antonio OWASP Chapter: Wednesday, April 20, 2011

Topic: Vulnerable Frameworks Yield Vulnerable Apps

Presenter: Javier Castro

Date: Wednesday, April 30, 2011

Time: 11:30am-1:00pm

Location: San Antonio Technology Center (Web Room) 3463 Magic Drive, San Antonio, TX 78229 http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=3463+Magic+Drive,+San+Antonio,+TX+78229


Abstract: Major software vendors such as VMware and SAP are getting significantly better at writing secure software, but all of this effort is lost when they forget to properly configure or secure the frameworks that their software is built upon. This talk gives an overview of several recently discovered vulnerabilities in the products of major software companies. In each case the flaw leads to a complete system compromise and was located in a framework that the product was built upon. We as software developers can learn from these cases and avoid similar scenarios.

Please RSVP: E-mail owasprsvp at denimgroup.com or call (210) 572-4400.
