All:

This Friday will be our next OWASP San Antonio meeting and we?ll be hearing about Serverless Security:
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-San-Antonio/events/242640921/

Title: Serverless Security: What?s Left To Protect?

Abstract:
Serverless means handing off server management to the cloud platforms ? along with their security risks. With the ?pros? ensuring our servers are patched, what?s left for application owners to protect? As it turns out, quite a lot. This talk discusses the aspects of security serverless doesn?t solve, the problems it could make worse, and the tools and practices you can use to keep yourself safe.

Speaker: Geva Solomonovich, COO Snyk

As always ? FREE LUNCH! Please make sure to sign up on the MeetUp so we have enough food. Bring some co-workers who might be interested!

Thanks,

Dan
