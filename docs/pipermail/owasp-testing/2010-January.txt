Subject: [Owasp-testing] top 10 & testing guide
Message-ID: <89f89941001051759r508ae57nd5a77efec2374fad@mail.gmail.com>

First of all, sorry for the x-posting, but it seemed appropriate.

For those of you that don't know, I work in the financial sector and
developed our organization's WAS testing procedures, documentation, and
probably 80% of our whole WAS program from OWASP materials. Great stuff.

As matter of fact, each of our analysts has a LULU printed copy of the
testing guide on their desks. When we write reports up, we use the
OWASP-XX-XX as our classification mapping. For example:

Finding 1 - rXSS - OWASP-DV-001 - hxxp://www.vulnsite.com?msg=<blah blah,
you get it> - screenshot1.png

When we write our long form reports, we use the text from the testing guide.
It has really proven great for us and we've been doing this since v2 came
out. In addition, we have previously used the top ten literature as
supplementary in proving higher risk, higher priority items. That has worked
great until now.....

A8 on the RC version of the Top Ten throws a nice shiny wrench into it all.
Reason being, there isn't a corresponding OWASP-xx-xx classification that
matches up to A8. Now I've been writing A8 up for some time, but it never
had a nice-neat home in any of the Testing guide classifications.

Now that I've gotten past all that. I'd like to maybe discuss how, possibly
in the future, the two projects could be somewhat more in sync. I'm not sure
there is a good way to do that today, but it sure makes sense in my mind
that all owaspy stuff have some overlap, and should avoid gaps such as the
A8 vs OWASP-XX-XX situation.

Also I see some gaps here:

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JdybrokZBAk/S0Nt5DVYHWI/AAAAAAAABvU/HXQSzzoRJu0/s1600-h/WASC.png

That aren't covered in any OWASP documentation, and should be. I'd like to
get everyones' thoughts, and probably flames, on this stuff.

Hi Brad. I'm game for figuring out a common identifier scheme/convention, ideally before the end of the month or so, which is the current ETA to putting out a call for contributors to work on the next rev of the dev guide, which as Dave mentioned will be reorganized according to ASVS.

Maybe a first step is to take a look at this: http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/Introduction?tm=6  I just replaced the ASVS' "A#" with "D#" but kept the title.  The "D#" is a Mike-ism/first cut at a dev guide numbering scheme, so 100% open to working with you on this, since obviously the thought crossed my mind something had to be figured out. We're also in the early stages of planning a next release of ASVS as Dave alludes to below as well, so now's a good time to talk about this, i.e. we could potentially also markup http://code.google.com/p/owasp-asvs/wiki/ASVS?tm=6  in a similar fashion.

Based on your email below, I generally think we should have a major/minor kinda scheme that starts with ASVS and goes to whatever:

OWASP-V[1-14]-[1-n,A,D,T,other]-[1-m,A,D,T,other]

i.e., as if one were expanding a tree control that when one got to a detailed verification requirement, would then have children nodes for e.g. development guide, testing guide, perhaps threats that the requirements map to like T10/CWE/WASC.

Let me know your thoughts, the above is just a first proposal, I may not be understanding what you need. We can use the above dev guide wiki to flesh this out, see how much things make sense as we go, thing look different from email/paper to clickable trees/widgets.

Best,

Mike B.

Brad,

OWASP is just starting a synchronization effort between the Top 10, ASVS, and all the Guides. We are trying to use the ASVS requirements as the baseline and then developing the dev guide and testing guide and code review against that outline.  However, we don't want to wreck what you guys have been doing with the testing guide #'s

Mike Boberski is working with Andrew van der Stock to launch an update effort to the Dev Guide. Can you work with Mike so he understands how you are using the OWASP finding #'s to see if we can move forward in a way that is not massively disruptive? Mike may not even be aware of the testing guide numbering scheme.

And we can also make sure that the dev guide covers everything you think needs to be covered (which hopefully already is covered in ASVS), and if not, maybe it needs to be updated too.

Mike and Dave,

Great stuff!
Actually I think your first stab is a great starting point, and would
provide a great cross mapping between documentation. We use these ID
numbers for a number of purposes, but primarily in communication with
vendors/developers. We require a simple way to communicate details of
a vulnerability and also to summarize them. The testing guide ID
numbers lend themselves well to this because they can be summarized,
while still providing detail about the specific finding. For example,
I can tell a vendor that we found 19 Data Validation issues, and then
break it down into DV-001, DV-002, etc

Now, the testing guide numbering system isn't all gravy. =)

Some of the failures we have noticed is that there is little reference
that these number provide to help developers resolve the issue.
Obviously, lots of these devs have never seen OWASP, nor WAS for that
matter. Also, there are some finding types that are very verbose, such
as the DV-001 and DV-002, whereas other types such as CM-003 and
CM-004 are massive catch-alls for us because of their vagueness. I
think think  the process of syncing and mapping will identify and
resolve these in itself.

Our organization's WAS effort isn't quite mature enough to fully
utilize the ASVS yet, but having this as part of a central, standard
Identification system for findings would make it that much easier to
integrate it at a sooner date.

One of the items that Dinis mentioned at the DC summit was that he
wanted OWASP to sponsor a group of crazies such as ourselves to fly to
a neutral location for a weekend and hammer something out that would
provide great value to the organization. Slap me if I'm wrong, but
this sure seems like a massive return for OWASP should be do it
correctly. Thoughts?

I've attached some sanitized reports to assist in my explanation. I
don't expect to tailor any of this to me or my organization, but
hopefully seeing how these projects are used in production can assist
in some way.

ok but if the TG and CRG use the same numbers, as is envisaged, it is really
very simple rather than introducing additional reference convention or am I
barking up the wrong tree here?

Whats wrong with the Testing guide convention?
I am planning to correlate the CRG with this convention.

My ?10:

The ASDR (Not sure what happened it ) was meant to tie up TG, CGR and DG
Top 10 Refs CRG, TG (Not sure about Dev Guide)
If we consolidate the "trinity of guides" Top 10 ref to any of the guides
should be forward and reverse navigable.

I'd think aligning the numbers would have huge benefit to OWASP and the
greater App Sec community.  Get OWASP's IDs straight and we can create a
map between OWASP <-> CWE <-> WASC.  If you're vendor or product reports
in CWE, no problem.  Use the map to look up how to test (Testing Guide &
Code Review Guide) or how to fix it (Developer Guide) - that would be
huge.  Then, ASVS is right there to bring it all together.

Considering how long the Testing Guide has been out and frequent
references to it in things like the DISA Application Security and
Development Checklist [1], I like the idea below of starting with the
Testing Guide references, sync'ing with the Code Review Guide and using
ASVS as the umbrella to unify them all.

<joke>Does that make ASVS the one Guide to rule them all? </joke>

Ok, I see what you've done with the examples, thanks for forwarding those.

Let me review further and think this for a little bit, and I'll come up with a next proposal, based on these inputs. 

I think we can work this out without too much fuss over email and using the wikis. If anyone on these CC'd lists wants to jump in as we go, please feel free.

Subject: Re: Common numbering scheme/convention (formerly "top 10 & testing guide" thread)

Mike and Dave,

Great stuff!
Actually I think your first stab is a great starting point, and would provide a great cross mapping between documentation. We use these ID numbers for a number of purposes, but primarily in communication with vendors/developers. We require a simple way to communicate details of a vulnerability and also to summarize them. The testing guide ID numbers lend themselves well to this because they can be summarized, while still providing detail about the specific finding. For example, I can tell a vendor that we found 19 Data Validation issues, and then break it down into DV-001, DV-002, etc

Now, the testing guide numbering system isn't all gravy. =)

Some of the failures we have noticed is that there is little reference that these number provide to help developers resolve the issue.
Obviously, lots of these devs have never seen OWASP, nor WAS for that matter. Also, there are some finding types that are very verbose, such as the DV-001 and DV-002, whereas other types such as CM-003 and
CM-004 are massive catch-alls for us because of their vagueness. I think think  the process of syncing and mapping will identify and resolve these in itself.

Our organization's WAS effort isn't quite mature enough to fully utilize the ASVS yet, but having this as part of a central, standard Identification system for findings would make it that much easier to integrate it at a sooner date.

One of the items that Dinis mentioned at the DC summit was that he wanted OWASP to sponsor a group of crazies such as ourselves to fly to a neutral location for a weekend and hammer something out that would provide great value to the organization. Slap me if I'm wrong, but this sure seems like a massive return for OWASP should be do it correctly. Thoughts?

I've attached some sanitized reports to assist in my explanation. I don't expect to tailor any of this to me or my organization, but hopefully seeing how these projects are used in production can assist in some way.

Basically what I'm going to propose next is to use the testing guide's scheme, after inserting an ASVS identifier component. I've just essentially read the email and forwarded information though.

Nothing. But, the proposal is to align numbering schemes, using ASVS as the common denominator.

Hi Brad. I'm game for figuring out a common identifier scheme/convention, ideally before the end of the month or so, which is the current ETA to putting out a call for contributors to work on the next rev of the dev guide, which as Dave mentioned will be reorganized according to ASVS.

Maybe a first step is to take a look at this: http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/Introduction?tm=6  I just replaced the ASVS' "A#" with "D#" but kept the title.  The "D#" is a Mike-ism/first cut at a dev guide numbering scheme, so 100% open to working with you on this, since obviously the thought crossed my mind something had to be figured out. We're also in the early stages of planning a next release of ASVS as Dave alludes to below as well, so now's a good time to talk about this, i.e. we could potentially also markup http://code.google.com/p/owasp-asvs/wiki/ASVS?tm=6  in a similar fashion.

Based on your email below, I generally think we should have a major/minor kinda scheme that starts with ASVS and goes to whatever:

OWASP-V[1-14]-[1-n,A,D,T,other]-[1-m,A,D,T,other]

i.e., as if one were expanding a tree control that when one got to a detailed verification requirement, would then have children nodes for e.g. development guide, testing guide, perhaps threats that the requirements map to like T10/CWE/WASC.

Let me know your thoughts, the above is just a first proposal, I may not be understanding what you need. We can use the above dev guide wiki to flesh this out, see how much things make sense as we go, thing look different from email/paper to clickable trees/widgets.

Brad,

OWASP is just starting a synchronization effort between the Top 10, ASVS, and all the Guides. We are trying to use the ASVS requirements as the baseline and then developing the dev guide and testing guide and code review against that outline.  However, we don't want to wreck what you guys have been doing with the testing guide #'s

Mike Boberski is working with Andrew van der Stock to launch an update effort to the Dev Guide. Can you work with Mike so he understands how you are using the OWASP finding #'s to see if we can move forward in a way that is not massively disruptive? Mike may not even be aware of the testing guide numbering scheme.

And we can also make sure that the dev guide covers everything you think needs to be covered (which hopefully already is covered in ASVS), and if not, maybe it needs to be updated too.

First of all, sorry for the x-posting, but it seemed appropriate.

For those of you that don't know, I work in the financial sector and developed our organization's WAS testing procedures, documentation, and probably 80% of our whole WAS program from OWASP materials. Great stuff.

As matter of fact, each of our analysts has a LULU printed copy of the testing guide on their desks. When we write reports up, we use the OWASP-XX-XX as our classification mapping. For example:

Finding 1 - rXSS - OWASP-DV-001 - hxxp://www.vulnsite.com?msg=<http://www.vulnsite.com?msg=><blah blah, you get it> - screenshot1.png

When we write our long form reports, we use the text from the testing guide. It has really proven great for us and we've been doing this since v2 came out. In addition, we have previously used the top ten literature as supplementary in proving higher risk, higher priority items. That has worked great until now.....

A8 on the RC version of the Top Ten throws a nice shiny wrench into it all. Reason being, there isn't a corresponding OWASP-xx-xx classification that matches up to A8. Now I've been writing A8 up for some time, but it never had a nice-neat home in any of the Testing guide classifications.

Now that I've gotten past all that. I'd like to maybe discuss how, possibly in the future, the two projects could be somewhat more in sync. I'm not sure there is a good way to do that today, but it sure makes sense in my mind that all owaspy stuff have some overlap, and should avoid gaps such as the A8 vs OWASP-XX-XX situation.

Also I see some gaps here:

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JdybrokZBAk/S0Nt5DVYHWI/AAAAAAAABvU/HXQSzzoRJu0/s1600-h/WASC.png

That aren't covered in any OWASP documentation, and should be. I'd like to get everyones' thoughts, and probably flames, on this stuff.

The goal in my mind should make it obvious by inspection how numbers in any given document relate back to the ASVS, and for e.g. the testing guide, make it obvious by inspection how it relates back to the existing TG numbering.

Hi Brad. I'm game for figuring out a common identifier scheme/convention, ideally before the end of the month or so, which is the current ETA to putting out a call for contributors to work on the next rev of the dev guide, which as Dave mentioned will be reorganized according to ASVS.

Maybe a first step is to take a look at this: http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/Introduction?tm=6  I just replaced the ASVS' "A#" with "D#" but kept the title.  The "D#" is a Mike-ism/first cut at a dev guide numbering scheme, so 100% open to working with you on this, since obviously the thought crossed my mind something had to be figured out. We're also in the early stages of planning a next release of ASVS as Dave alludes to below as well, so now's a good time to talk about this, i.e. we could potentially also markup http://code.google.com/p/owasp-asvs/wiki/ASVS?tm=6  in a similar fashion.

Based on your email below, I generally think we should have a major/minor kinda scheme that starts with ASVS and goes to whatever:

OWASP-V[1-14]-[1-n,A,D,T,other]-[1-m,A,D,T,other]

i.e., as if one were expanding a tree control that when one got to a detailed verification requirement, would then have children nodes for e.g. development guide, testing guide, perhaps threats that the requirements map to like T10/CWE/WASC.

Let me know your thoughts, the above is just a first proposal, I may not be understanding what you need. We can use the above dev guide wiki to flesh this out, see how much things make sense as we go, thing look different from email/paper to clickable trees/widgets.

Subject: [Owasp-topten] top 10 & testing guide

First of all, sorry for the x-posting, but it seemed appropriate.

For those of you that don't know, I work in the financial sector and developed our organization's WAS testing procedures, documentation, and probably 80% of our whole WAS program from OWASP materials. Great stuff.

As matter of fact, each of our analysts has a LULU printed copy of the testing guide on their desks. When we write reports up, we use the OWASP-XX-XX as our classification mapping. For example:

Finding 1 - rXSS - OWASP-DV-001 - hxxp://www.vulnsite.com?msg=<http://www.vulnsite.com?msg=><blah blah, you get it> - screenshot1.png

When we write our long form reports, we use the text from the testing guide. It has really proven great for us and we've been doing this since v2 came out. In addition, we have previously used the top ten literature as supplementary in proving higher risk, higher priority items. That has worked great until now.....

A8 on the RC version of the Top Ten throws a nice shiny wrench into it all. Reason being, there isn't a corresponding OWASP-xx-xx classification that matches up to A8. Now I've been writing A8 up for some time, but it never had a nice-neat home in any of the Testing guide classifications.

Now that I've gotten past all that. I'd like to maybe discuss how, possibly in the future, the two projects could be somewhat more in sync. I'm not sure there is a good way to do that today, but it sure makes sense in my mind that all owaspy stuff have some overlap, and should avoid gaps such as the A8 vs OWASP-XX-XX situation.

Also I see some gaps here:

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JdybrokZBAk/S0Nt5DVYHWI/AAAAAAAABvU/HXQSzzoRJu0/s1600-h/WASC.png

That aren't covered in any OWASP documentation, and should be. I'd like to get everyones' thoughts, and probably flames, on this stuff.

ok but if the TG and CRG use the same numbers, as is envisaged, it is really very simple rather than introducing additional reference convention or am I barking up the wrong tree here?


2010/1/6 Boberski, Michael [USA] <boberski_michael at bah.com<mailto:boberski_michael at bah.com>>
The goal in my mind should make it obvious by inspection how numbers in any given document relate back to the ASVS, and for e.g. the testing guide, make it obvious by inspection how it relates back to the existing TG numbering.

So we'll have OWASP TG and CRG refs + ASVS refs also?

Nothing. But, the proposal is to align numbering schemes, using ASVS as the common denominator.

OWASP is just starting a synchronization effort between the Top 10, ASVS, and all the Guides.

Hi Brad. I'm game for figuring out a common identifier scheme/convention, ideally before the end of the month or so, which is the current ETA to putting out a call for contributors to work on the next rev of the dev guide, which as Dave mentioned will be reorganized according to ASVS.

Maybe a first step is to take a look at this: http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/Introduction?tm=6  I just replaced the ASVS' "A#" with "D#" but kept the title.  The "D#" is a Mike-ism/first cut at a dev guide numbering scheme, so 100% open to working with you on this, since obviously the thought crossed my mind something had to be figured out. We're also in the early stages of planning a next release of ASVS as Dave alludes to below as well, so now's a good time to talk about this, i.e. we could potentially also markup http://code.google.com/p/owasp-asvs/wiki/ASVS?tm=6  in a similar fashion.

Based on your email below, I generally think we should have a major/minor kinda scheme that starts with ASVS and goes to whatever:

OWASP-V[1-14]-[1-n,A,D,T,other]-[1-m,A,D,T,other]

i.e., as if one were expanding a tree control that when one got to a detailed verification requirement, would then have children nodes for e.g. development guide, testing guide, perhaps threats that the requirements map to like T10/CWE/WASC.

Let me know your thoughts, the above is just a first proposal, I may not be understanding what you need. We can use the above dev guide wiki to flesh this out, see how much things make sense as we go, thing look different from email/paper to clickable trees/widgets.

Best,

Mike B.

Brad,

OWASP is just starting a synchronization effort between the Top 10, ASVS, and all the Guides. We are trying to use the ASVS requirements as the baseline and then developing the dev guide and testing guide and code review against that outline.  However, we don't want to wreck what you guys have been doing with the testing guide #'s

Mike Boberski is working with Andrew van der Stock to launch an update effort to the Dev Guide. Can you work with Mike so he understands how you are using the OWASP finding #'s to see if we can move forward in a way that is not massively disruptive? Mike may not even be aware of the testing guide numbering scheme.

And we can also make sure that the dev guide covers everything you think needs to be covered (which hopefully already is covered in ASVS), and if not, maybe it needs to be updated too.

I'd think aligning the numbers would have huge benefit to OWASP and the greater App Sec community.  Get OWASP's IDs straight and we can create a map between OWASP <-> CWE <-> WASC.  If you're vendor or product reports in CWE, no problem.  Use the map to look up how to test (Testing Guide & Code Review Guide) or how to fix it (Developer Guide) - that would be huge.  Then, ASVS is right there to bring it all together.

Considering how long the Testing Guide has been out and frequent references to it in things like the DISA Application Security and Development Checklist [1], I like the idea below of starting with the Testing Guide references, sync'ing with the Code Review Guide and using ASVS as the umbrella to unify them all.

<joke>Does that make ASVS the one Guide to rule them all? </joke>

"Now, the testing guide numbering system isn't all gravy. =)"

that be fighting talk, sniff...

I'm not all partial to the ASVS way of doing things, but then again I have a
certain bias to the testing guide's numbering system. At the end of the day
having a less confusing appsec world would make me happier, so if this is
the way forward, so be it.

Let us work on this using a specific example, SQL Injection: 

Here is a proposal for your consideration:

ASVS Ref. Number
OWASP-V0604

TG Ref. Number
OWASP-T0604-DV-005
(compared to currently: OWASP-DV-005)

CRG Ref. Number
OWASP-C0604-DV-005

Guide Ref. Number
OWASP-D0604 
(goes into guidance at this level, in the next release)

Where,

OWASP-V0604 == V6.4  Verify that all untrusted data that is output to SQL interpreters use parameterized interfaces, prepared statements, or are escaped properly.

Thinking from the perspective of a purely ignorant person, this is
rather confusing. Problem is, it totally makes sense as to why you did
what you did, to me. So which of those numbers would be final one? And
with that number alone, could I find what I needed in each guide?

*thinking aloud*
Ideally, we have 2 ultimate goals in my mind. (bear with me here)
1. create a central ID number, and provide a mapping to each project.
(maybe a good interim goal)
2. Actually _change_ each OWASP guide to match the TG or some agreed
upon numbering system.

Now, you are probably all asking "why are we chosing to go with the
TG?". Well I wasn't sold either, and I'm still not 100%. But it does
appear to provide detailed numberin for specific vulnerabilities, and
has a pretty good following. (and I'm partial because I currently rely
on it)
Here is the catch! There are going to be holes no matter which
direction we take, for example, the TG has items the ASVS doesn't.
Which is why I'm voting for a super detailed comprehensive "master
list" and match them up for now, item #1. And allow each project to
catch up to the list, ultimately leading to a truly complete #2.

I'm literally thinking out loud here guys, so fire back full force.

Right, the next step if there were agreement would be to basically take the
table from the TG that summarizes the IDs, add a couple columns, and start
mapping.

Then, each doc would be updated in turn, and yes each would then have to
address any holes. Not an issue from the ASVS or dev guide perspective.

Hi,
I totally agree, that should be a great added value for the OWASP Guides.
I think we can create a page on our wiki for that purpose, tracking
our brainstorming and the links between the Guides.

As Mike said, we can start from here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist

So we can create the OWASP naming convention (e.g. OWASP-DV-001 -
Reflected XSS) and mapping that with all the Guides.
In that way we can reach 2 goals in my opinion:
- update the Guides and understand what the DG,CRG,TG, Top10, ASVS are
missing and what we can improve in each guide (also if some controls
are specific to certain guides).
- create a more accessible starting point for the exploration of the
wiki from a user perspective.

Thanks,
Mat

Great idea,

I created the following wiki page for us to use:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering

Excellent suggestions. 

I am going to go research along the lines you suggest.

Keep 'em coming!

Subject: Re: [Owasp-topten] [Owasp-testing] RFC: Common numbering proposal # 1


(I'm sure my email will bounce to some of these lists)


As someone who's been doing security-related common numbering on a daily basis for, like, 10 years now, adoping any kind of numbering scheme like what you're talking about will:

- make it much easier for people to reference your work

- save a huge amount of time in your own work to keep synchronized

- make it easier, and faster, for people to find information related to the given ID, whether the info is offered by OWASP or others

- make it easier to cross-reference OWASP with other people's work at a low level of detail, e.g. to conduct gap analysis

Needless to say, I'm very supportive of the idea of common numbering.  It appears that this is already well underway.

A handful of suggestions, if it's not too late to consider:

- don't try to encode any information into the ID that is likely to change or be subject to debate.  In the olden days of CVE, we used to have "CAN-1999-0067" which would change into "CVE-1999-0067" once the item was considered stable and sufficiently verified.  That made the ID hard to use.  Right now, OWASP-DV-001 encodes the term "data validation" in the DV acronym, but what happens if in a couple of years, some new and better term occurs, or the focus changes from validation to something else?  (As an example, it's only recently that the "data validation" term itself has become popular.)

- carefully consider the range of values that your ID space supports, and if possible, allow it to expand.  CVE has a "CVE-10K" problem because we never expected that we would ever come close to tracking 10,000 vulnerabilities a year.  Red Hat had to change their advisory numbering scheme a couple years ago.  etc.

- don't change the fundamental meaning of the ID once you've assigned it. 
This causes confusion, and more importantly, it immediately invalidates almost everyone's mappings to that ID - including people who you don't even know are using that ID.

- closely monitor the mappings that get made.  Typos and misunderstandings are rarely caught.  People may make assumptions about what "the item" 
really is, based only on a quick scan of a short name or title.  Since you're dealing with diverse sources, there are likely to be many-to-many relationships in dealing with mappings.

- determine some kind of procedure for handling duplicates.  They're gonna happen.

- the more you distribute the process of creating and assigning IDs between multiple people, the more inconsistencies and duplicates you will wind up with.  This may be unavoidable, since the job is usually bigger than one person.

- determine some kind of procedure for deprecating IDs, i.e., "retiring" 
them and discouraging their use by others.  This will probably happen for reasons other than duplicates.  There should be some final record, somewhere, of what happened to the deprecated item - i.e., it shouldn't just disappear off the face of the earth.

- Steve

I like a unique, and shared identifier within all of OWASP. It might even allow us to get the Honeycomb and other materials integrated in finally!

My main concern is the length. 

OWASP-WEBAPP will be the primary prefix for 99% of the materials we have today. Thus everything will start with that. 

I'd like for the WEBAPP to drop away, and become:

OWASP-CG-2009-C0604
OWASP-TC-2009-T0604
OWASP-AV-2009-V0604
OWASP-DG-2009-D0604
OWASP-TX-2010-A01

We don't need to encode values into these as they're for cross-referencing, not stating a fact. 

There are several segments relevant to OWASP's interests I think we need to reserve now. Some of these we have material today, and some we don't (but should).

Architecture and Design (AR)
Education (ED)
Risk Management (RM)
Operational Risk (OR)

There will be others as we think about the SDLC in fill in the gaps. 

thanks,
Andrew

I am Totally behind a common identification nomenclature (or whatever you
want to call it).
I have also seen refs to the OWASP TG in industry in the pat year or so.
It's something I've wanted to do since the summit in portugal

Excellent advice, thank you, I added it to the guidance portion of the wiki page, and will take this advice into account for the next revision.

Hi,

I highly appreciate this new numbering and mapping approach.
>From my experience with opensecurityarchitecture.org<http://opensecurityarchitecture.org> and from what I saw at NIST  I can comment that we made the following experience:

 -  adding the (release) year into the numbering scheme can be problematic, because the document has a life cycle that goes over years ....
 -  I would rather try to accommodate a versioning scheme that is human readable in the reference number as well (e.g.  V02, or RevA, or...)

Hope this helps
Best regards
Tobias

I like a unique, and shared identifier within all of OWASP. It might even allow us to get the Honeycomb and other materials integrated in finally!

My main concern is the length.

OWASP-WEBAPP will be the primary prefix for 99% of the materials we have today. Thus everything will start with that.

I'd like for the WEBAPP to drop away, and become:

OWASP-CG-2009-C0604
OWASP-TC-2009-T0604
OWASP-AV-2009-V0604
OWASP-DG-2009-D0604
OWASP-TX-2010-A01

We don't need to encode values into these as they're for cross-referencing, not stating a fact.

There are several segments relevant to OWASP's interests I think we need to reserve now. Some of these we have material today, and some we don't (but should).

Architecture and Design (AR)
Education (ED)
Risk Management (RM)
Operational Risk (OR)

There will be others as we think about the SDLC in fill in the gaps.

thanks,
Andrew

That's what I was thinking as well, it's a bit of advertising to somehow include "OWASP" in the identifiers.

I agree, that's a better way to put it/to thing about it, in terms of developing a namespace. Andrew's comments are also along the lines of being more clear about project acronyms. I will take this advice when I put out a next proposal, thank you!

We use our project acronym in all the MITRE-led standards - CVE-2009-0012, OVAL12, cpe:/a:microsoft:windows-nt:2008, etc.  It's not "advertising" so much as carving up your own namespace.  Whatever scheme you adopt, there will likely be other efforts in the world that use a similar scheme, which makes it more time-consuming for somebody to search for your ID on the web, for example.

Great work so far everyone.

Just a few thoughts:

Your forth example: "OWASP-TG-0604-DV-005", references the Testing Guide by 0604 which doesn't exist. Is the plan to renumber the testing guide (and other docs) before creating the mapping? If mapping is no longer the end goal but rather a common numbering scheme, then a document reference shouldn't be needed at location 6-7. The numbering scheme should be totally separate from all documents and all OWASP documents should be expected to adhere to it (IMHO).

i.e.: Examples 3 and 4:
OWASP-DG-0604
OWASP-TG-0604-DV-005
Should really be the same thing: OWASP-0604.

If for client reporting etc. some traditional or historic reference is required then this could be included at the end of the new common identifier as you've suggested on the wiki for proposal 3 (with the inclusion of the document identifier, i.e.: OWASP-0604-TGDV-005 or OWASP-0604-TG-DV-005).

Just my 2 cents.

Rick

Rick, good points.

If one looks at each document/guide's instantiation of a requirement as an iteration of a given base requirement though, we'd still need a document code.

The 14-40 are in the near term intended to allow for a transition from existing numbering schemes in a next release of a given guide, then used in the long term primarily for retiring numbers.

The above said, I'm going to think through paragraph "If for client reporting etc" further...

Any other comments, keep 'em coming!

Best,

Mike B.

I'm not saying that we should remove the document reference. I'm just suggesting that it should be part of the optional section. To someone (i.e.: a client I'm preparing a report for) OWASP-DG-0604 != OWASP-TG-0604 though equating/aligning all 0604s seems to be what we're trying to accomplish.

The way I understand the ultimate goal 0604 isn't really a TG or DG item it's an OWASP item that should be comon across all documents. I guess you could think of it as significant digits or something like that: OWASP-Item-Doc-Optional Deprication or Historic reference.

Rick, good points.

If one looks at each document/guide's instantiation of a requirement as an iteration of a given base requirement though, we'd still need a document code.

The 14-40 are in the near term intended to allow for a transition from existing numbering schemes in a next release of a given guide, then used in the long term primarily for retiring numbers.

The above said, I'm going to think through paragraph "If for client reporting etc" further...

Any other comments, keep 'em coming!

Great work so far everyone.

Just a few thoughts:

Your forth example: "OWASP-TG-0604-DV-005", references the Testing Guide by 0604 which doesn't exist. Is the plan to renumber the testing guide (and other docs) before creating the mapping? If mapping is no longer the end goal but rather a common numbering scheme, then a document reference shouldn't be needed at location 6-7. The numbering scheme should be totally separate from all documents and all OWASP documents should be expected to adhere to it (IMHO).

i.e.: Examples 3 and 4:
OWASP-DG-0604
OWASP-TG-0604-DV-005
Should really be the same thing: OWASP-0604.

If for client reporting etc. some traditional or historic reference is required then this could be included at the end of the new common identifier as you've suggested on the wiki for proposal 3 (with the inclusion of the document identifier, i.e.: OWASP-0604-TGDV-005 or OWASP-0604-TG-DV-005).

Just my 2 cents.

Rick

Hi Pekka. Great points! 

Two comments below caught my eye in particular, to paraphrase:

* How will requirements be deprecated?
* Where will tables that define e.g. document codes be located?

For the first item, the short answer is that I don't know, we've not yet talked about this, other than how it might work from an identifier perspective. There should be some discussion about this on the wiki page though, at least as a placeholder.

For the second item, again I don't know, we've got it on the one wiki page, we've not yet talked about this. Perhaps that is sufficient, keeping it as an article linked to the ASVS project, perhaps something additional/different will need to be done.

Any other comments, keep 'em coming!
 
Best, 
 
Mike B.

Hello!

I like the idea of a global/common unique identifier for the requirements to be shared within all Owasp documentation! I also like the idea that you can directly see which requirement category is in question.

As you requested comments, I have some ideas that could be considered.
In my opinion, the current suggestion does not well address this
principle:
"carefully consider the range of values that your ID space supports, and if possible, allow it to expand"

Some questions:
- Which are the benefits of a static length? Why not to "allow it to expand"?
- How is DEPRECATED used? (in asvs, what code does the replacing requirement get?) Why is it included in the id, if it's deprecated (no- one will use such id:s anyway)? I would not include this in the identifier syntax, but there should definitely be a table that shows also deprecation with a "deprecated by" field.
- What if a category becomes deprecated?
- How is the "grand table of identifiers" maintained with all deprecated id's etc.?

I would consider e.g. the following format for a Common identifiers that could be referenced with similar syntax in any document .

OWASP-x-y(-v)

x = requirement category (e.g. 4 for Access control) y = requirement number (e.g. 5 "Verify that directory browsing is disabled unless deliberately desired.") v = version (e.g. 1) (latest, if not shown)

Which would make it OWASP-4-5-1.

This way, new categories could be created easily. And as a new is invented, it would be just OWASP-(n+1). Similarly, when a new requirement is invented, it's just OWASP-n-(m+1)-1. In the future, if some requirement seems to better suit in another category, it will get the next "free slot" in that category's number space. (and gets "deprecated by" tag in the previous category)

The structure of every release of ASVS or any other document could be different, if the identifier was not directly tied with the hierarchical order of the document. This way it would also be easier to change the structural order of the requirements to more logical in the future, if required.

Every time the requirement text changes (e.g. to more specific, in the next ASVS release), the last number is increased by one.

It is probably a good idea to give a unique identifier (document code) for each document as well, and let each document to specify their own identifier space e.g. DG-v1.x-DV-005 for mapping with OWASP-codes. But could this just be a separate mapping table instead, with a column for each document? Would this be any better than having multiple identifiers pointing to the same requirement in the same namespace?

I am not sure, if this kind of "safety" is required, or if the syntax I suggested is any better, but I just wanted to think how this syntax will work in the future, as changes will happen anyway.

Thanks for the good work!

Regards,
Pekka

Hi,

Please see http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering for what appears to be a generally agreed-upon new numbering scheme.

Please see the TOC of the following to "kick the tires", to expand/collapse the navigation tree to see how the numbering would work in practice: http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/Introduction

Next steps are basically to start using it on next versions of guides and whatnot. That's already done for the development guide, as evidenced by the above link. For the testing and other guides, the very next step is to start doing a mapping of the new numbers to legacy identifiers, put that in tables in document or wiki page somewhere, before doing any sort of updates or enhancements to baseline documents. Brad, I'll contact you individually about this, any other people interested in helping, please contact me directly, and we'll work that in a smaller group.

Best,

Mike B.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] SSL Testing tool
Message-ID: <B3ACBF9400D0FD479F321DAD89EAB52802A2CEDB@sedc1mail1.omegapoint.se>

Hello,

Last weekend I hacked together a piece of software that checks what SSL protocols and ciphers a web server supports, which is available for download at http://code.google.com/p/sslaudit/.

>From the above mentioned website:

--8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<-
SSLAudit is a tool that verifies SSL certificate and supported protocols/ciphers of a SSL-enabled webserver. The result is graded according to SSLLabs SSL Server Rating Guide<https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/rating-guide/index.html>.

The tool is similar in function to SSLDigger from Foundstone<http://www.foundstone.com/us/resources/proddesc/ssldigger.htm> and THCSSLCheck from The Hacker Choice<http://freeworld.thc.org/root/tools/> but is different that it is open source and is easily modified to support new protocols and ciphers as they become available and the result is graded.

This project is sponsored by Omegapoint AB<http://www.omegapoint.se> and was created to assist security assessments done according to OWASP Testing Guide<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project>.

--8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<-
It currently performs the following tests:

?         SSL Protocol support detection

?         SSL Cipher support detection

?         Public cert PEM extraction

?         Certificate timeframe validation (and warns if it is 30 days or less until the certificate expires)

?         Grading of result according to SSLLabs SSL Server Rating Guide

Your feedback is much appreciated.

Best regards
Michael Boman

Indeed, I was just coming up with a plan to write my own open-source one due
to the inadequacies of current tools (Windows only, not complete, multiple
tools required to be comprehensive, etc).  Excellent work.

It only shows one thing, we need to update the testing guide with more tool examples so these tools get more coverage.

In my opinion the openssl command line tool nor Nessus does a detailed enough job to fully cover OWASP-CM-001.

Hello,

Last weekend I hacked together a piece of software that checks what SSL protocols and ciphers a web server supports, which is available for download at http://code.google.com     /p/sslaudit/<http://code.google.com/p/sslaudit/>.

>From the above mentioned website:

--8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<-
SSLAudit is a tool that verifies SSL certificate and supported protocols/ciphers of a SSL-enabled webserver. The result is graded according to SSLLabs SSL Server Rating Guide<https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/rating-guide/index.html>.

The tool is similar in function to SSLDigger from Foundstone<http://www.foundstone.com/us/resources/proddesc/ssldigger.htm> and THCSSLCheck from The Hacker Choice<http://freeworld.thc.org/root/tools/> but is different that it is open source and is easily modified to support new protocols and ciphers as they become available and the result is graded.

This project is sponsored by Omegapoint AB<http://www.omegapoint.se> and was created to assist security assessments done according to OWASP Testing Guide<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project>.

--8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<---8<-
It currently performs the following tests:

*         SSL Protocol support detection

*         SSL Cipher support detection

*         Public cert PEM extraction

*         Certificate timeframe validation (and warns if it is 30 days or less until the certificate expires)

*         Grading of result according to SSLLabs SSL Server Rating Guide

Your feedback is much appreciated.

Best regards
Michael Boman

Or you can still use online SSL checking (which mostly does the same job as
these tools):

And here is an example:

I did this in a bubble, ie, without anyone to bounce it off of.

Rick, that is probably my fault. I got confused and scattered the wiki all
up. Mike is waiting on me to go back and fix it, but as usual, life gets in
the way sometimes.
It is on my TODO list.

Perhaps Lorna can sneak something in when the corrected edition is published
with the complete list of organizational supporters.

The numbering scheme is set, the top of the page is correct, the further
examples using the new mappings below it do not need to be completed (I've
zeroed them out and put a placeholder instruction) in order to write about
it, if desired. I will create and post a project presentation either this
weekend or early next week, to keep things moving.

Lorna, if you could do us a solid on this, please email me directly, I'll
provide a paragraph that you can use at least as a starting point, maybe a
very simple call out box titled "Did you know?" or "Late-Breaking News" or
something.

Best,

Mike

I guess it's not a majorly big deal until it's finalized, but, I also think it's a huge step in a good direction for the OWASP projects so it's kind of important.

I agree this is very important.

The numbering scheme is finalized, but will take time to implement across
guides.

Here, I have added a paragraph to the project page that Lorna, if she is
able, can use:

Best,

Mike
