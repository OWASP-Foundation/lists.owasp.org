Will testing be in HTML and pdf format? XML perhaps or is that just for internal purposes?

Message-ID: <000001c27901$1e2effc0$644510ac@idwks1057>

I apologize for the long delay since the last update.  Let me fill you in on
a few changes.  As you may have noticed, our mailing list was migrated and
consolidated to the main OWASP sourceforge site, so our new list email is
owasp-testing at lists.sourceforge.net.

The peer review stage officially starts today!  Please download a copy of
everyone's contributions to date from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&release_id=11749
7 (TestingPeerReview0.1.sxw Peer Review 0.1).

After some helpful tips from Mark Curphey, I tried to do some
experimentation with docbook conversions to see what other formats besides
HTML we could do our peer review in and then covnert back to DocBook.  I
decided on the OpenOffice format (.sxw), which can be easily converted to
XML Docbook with the following script
(http://www.chez.com/ebellot/ooo2sdbk/).  A free copy of OpenOffice is
available on many platforms (windows, linus, etc.) at
http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/1.0.1/index.html.  Please download
a copy, you'll find it has most of the same features as MS Word, even CHANGE
TRACKING!  When installing it, please make sure to configure it with your
name so that any changes you make to the document are recognizable as your
own once I merge everyone's edits.  After opening the
TestingPeerReview0.1.sxw document, go to Edit -> Changes -> Record and make
your changes.

Please focus your reviewing scrutiny on adding or modifying content, rather
than grammar and formatting.  As you'll notice, the flowcharts are not
included in this draft as not many of us submitted them.  I think in a
future draft release, we can include them, but let's focus on the test for
now.  Any empty section is fair game for adding content!!!

Lets set a deadline of November 5th for feedback. I want to be somewhat
agressive on the peer review, as there is still quite a lot of content to
fill in as you can see.  Please send your modified edits to me directly and
I'll start to merge them.

Any questions, comments, suggestions?

Hi Dave


The sections that currently dont have any information in them, such as

you've read my mind Dave

just a side note on the usage of external url's (such as
online.securityfocus.com and www.eeye.com)
is there anything owasp need to do to get permission to link to those
sites.

im not sure on the US side of things, but in the UK, if you quote a
company in a public article, you need to make sure that the company is
aware of you doing that and happy with being quoted

In some way, shape or form, yes.  All of the sections in thedocument should
be filled in eventually, I just hope to have the help of the group and not
be stuck writing them all myself ;-)

I think with external links, we're fine.  As long as we're not quoting
directly from other copyrighted works or papers.

Dave et all

I just downloaded the draft from Sourceforge to look at and make some
comments / revisions. Maybe its me but I can't see the sections on how
to test for the common problems such as XSS and SQL injection that I
thought were going to be core to this document. 

Am I missing a version or should I write them  ?

Mark et al,

I think perhaps Noam's section 7.2.4.1 needs some more expansion on how to
methodically look for XSS (attack tree?) and the potentially common bad
characters sets to check as well as tools, etc.  The person responsible for
SQL injection was cut form the project due to non participation, so the
section is up for grabs (7.2.4.2).  

Feel free to add to or rewrite these sections  :-)  That's the point of peer
review.

David et all,

I am going to spend sometime over the next 48 hours to get a revised
draft out for review. I have quite a bit of material sitting in various
places, that I think is missing from this document so far.

I will also change the table of contents quite dramatically. Right now
this doesn't lend itself very well to a structured testing framework
IMHO. I know its early stages, not being overly critical ;-)

I am proposing to arrange the technical testing into classic webtiers.

WebTier would include sample files, auth (only HTTP not forms), backup
files, http server methods supported, file permissions etc

Application Tier would include the usual suspects of auth, session
management, XSS, parameter tampering, overflows, user account management
systems etc

Data Tier - SQL injection blah blah

The document so far looks like it has quite a bit of supporting
management type material but not a great deal of "nuts and bolts"
testing. It was always intended that that would be the bulk of this
project, how to actually test for things.

There is also some material that I am not sure I think is relevant or is
duplicated. I'll tackle that as well.

Give me 48 hours !

Mark,

Thanks for the candid feedback, looking forward to the edits.  I agree that
we need more nitty gritty how-to material on how to check for certain
things.  I also noticed that several sections read more like prevention
techniques rather than testing techniques.  I like your proposed formatting
changes, if we can all agree on them I'd like to upload a newer verison of
the document for discussion next week.  What is everyone else's initial
impressions and recommendations?

If everyone else hasn't already, please download the openoffice.org text
editor so we can move forward together as a group on this.  It's going to
take a bit of effort to get to a useable document, but we're getting closer.

Looking forward to the feedback,

-dave

p.s. PLEASEEEEE make sure your name is included in the OpenOffice
installation for editing sanity
