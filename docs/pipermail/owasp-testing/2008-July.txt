Pavol,

The context of "Information Gathering" is different when you apply it to Web
Application Security Testing compared to the Reconnaissance Phase of a
(Network and Host) Penetration Test of which Maltego applies to the latter.

Specifically, in the context of Web Application Security Testing the process
is focused on the /robots.txt and the associated robots <meta> tags and the
Crawler/Robot/Spider adhering to these controls.

I agree that Maltego should be documented somewhere but I disagree that the
OWASP Testing Guide is the appropriate document.

Hi,
during "Information Gathering" phase I use sophisticated search/mining and
correlation system Maltego http://www.paterva.com/maltego/ 
(I have no relation with that company!) 
But this tool significantly helps me in "completely passive" discovery 
(reveals a lot of mobile numbers, addresses, contacts, real owners of
audited 
web site etc.)

I think this kind of tools should be mentioned in "Information Gathering"
phase of the testing guide, because they are really helpful.

And for all, do you know any opensource alternative of this tool
(ok, there is a community version of Maltego 
http://www.paterva.com/maltego/community-edition/, but quite limited)

Thanks and regards,

Pavol

Message-ID: <af20956c0807161103yc1c2d34q30e37e617a8ccb35@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

I've started to do a batch of editorial changes to the intro chapter
of the testing guide. My plan is to finish with the intro by tonight,
wait for reactions, and, depending on those, back off or go on with
other sections of the guide :-)

The changes are mostly editorial: they try to streamline, reorganize,
and clarify the text, (mostly) without adding new content.
I'm trying to document the changes in the talk section of the page:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Talk:Testing_Guide_Introduction

Of course, feel free to ask me if you have any
questions/comments/criticism, or to revert back to the previous
version.

As I read your comments I think you reviewed the introduction of vs 2. Did
you also review the new additions on the testing methodology of vs 3. If so
I will be happy to address changes. 

 

I saw comments related to vs 3 additions of the methodology from Rick

 

Under "Developers' Security Tests" the following sentence doesn't read
clearly but I'm not 100% sure what the author was trying to say so I haven't
edited it: "A security unit testing framework might consist on a place
holder for security test cases and used to wrap the functions, methods and
classes that need to be security tested." Rick.mitchell 11:06, 15 July 2008
(EDT)

 

I will change the text and simplify and elaborate.

 

Also for the other parts that you addressed:

Questions: 

*	Is there a format for citations/references? 
*	Threat modeling in Testing Techniques Explained refers to a detailed
threat modeling methodology in part 2. Does this really exist? 

Open: 

*	The part on automated tools being bad at finding vulnerabilities
should probably be clarified (Mindset paragraph in principles) 

I can provide changes to address threat modeling for testing and tools being
bad to find vulnerabilities.

I think this are in vs 2 so I did not commit to change this part of my
re-writing, just let me know.

 

Regards

 

Marco

No, I haven't got there yet. I stopped at the end of section 3 in the
introduction... I hope to finish reading the new part today.

I guess my main concern here was that the paragraph reads a little bit
too categorical: I'm sure tools are good at detecting *certain*
classes of vulnerabilities under *certain* conditions. Then, as the
article says, they have limitations. Maybe, the discussion could be
cast in terms of false positives and false negatives?

[I forward part of the discourse going on with Marco in case somebody
wants to jump in and leave feedback]

Marco,

I think this discussion has brought up some good points. I answer briefly:

I like this discussion about the taxonomy of tools, the fact that
tools have different performance on different test cases
(vulnerabilities/targets), tool results have to be interpreted by a
human, and that they allow testers to focus on the really interesting
parts (hot spots) of the system. I think it's a more valuable
assessment than generically saying "automated tools are actually bad
at automatically testing for vulnerabilities" (which is in the guide
and was the target of my note :-)).

True. However, I have 2 comments here:
1. If i'm not mistaken, McGraw/Ranum/etc when they talk about
badness-meters, refer to pentesting (tools + human), not just testing
tools. And while some issues clearly overlap, I think it's good to
keep them separated.
2. More importantly, what McGraw/Ranum/etc (re)discover is that,
generally, testing of any interesting system is not sound. In other
words, in general, when testing, you have no false positives, but you
accept to have false negatives (there is no guarantee to find all the
vulnerabilities). Of course, this is relevant to this (testing) guide.
I don't know what the consensus is about this, but I think the real
value of a testing framework is that it removes (or can help remove)
much of the variability inherent in testing (in short, the outcomes
depend less on who is testing).

> these tools test for known vulnerabilities. The issue is on the "unknown" or the
> security issues that are not tested.

Just playing the devil's advocate here. Recently, there has been some
interesting research (at least in the academic camp, with which I'm
more familiar) on finding "unknown" vulnerabilities, for example, by
using anomaly detection techniques or specification learning
approaches (one good example is  "Bugs as Deviant Behavior" by D.
Engler and others. BTW, these are some of the people behind Coverity).

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Testing for user enumeration
Message-ID: <20080721225819.GA28205@hq.alert.sk>

Hi,
I've just noticed a new section "Testing for user enumeration" in Testing
Guide v3. http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_user_enumeration

My practical experiences - many applications return the same response when 
both combinations "valid username/wrong password" and 
"wrong username/wrong password" are sent (so they are not vulnerable), 
but they are still vulnerable to the following "user enumeration" attacks:

- timing attacks (noticeable time difference in case of 
"valid username/wrong password" and "wrong username/wrong password")

- different behaviour in "Password reset" form e.g. a user enters
"valid username" -> "Your new password has been sent to your email ... "
"wrong username" -> "Invalid user"
Only a few web applications are invulnerable to this enumeration attack and
display to the user this diplomatic response:
"If your username exists, your new password has been sent to your email... "

It would be great to mention these examples of the attack in this section.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Captcha testing
Message-ID: <20080721234012.GA4607@hq.alert.sk>

Hi,
I am not sure, if this is not too specific for testing guide, but actually
captcha is widely used and should be properly tested.

During my penetration tests I revealed some common vulnerabilities in many
web applications of bad implemented captcha that should be documented
(and I really don't know if "testing guide" is a good place):

- decoded captcha is encrypted (usually by some "security-by-obscurity" 
"home-made" algorithm) and this value is sent by client as a hidden field
(yeah, it's unbelievable but some web applications really do it in this way).
Often this can be easily decrypted by observing of multiple captcha values.

- even if it is difficult to decrypt decoded captcha value, many captchas are
vulnerable to replay attacks (attacker simply send old values of encrypted
decoded captcha value and decoded value of this captcha)

- many captchas don't destroy the session when the correct phrase is entered -
by reusing the session id of a known captcha it is possible to bypass
captcha protected page

- many captchas can be identified as weak by simple comparison with already
broken captchas (e.g. http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/gimpy/,
http://libcaca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha, http://www.lafdc.com/captcha/)

And I forgot - some "shiny" AJAX applications are also vulnerable to user
enumeration (e.g. in new user registration forms they interactively verify 
if the given user already exists or not). Sometimes in these applications it
is possible to enumerate even phone/mobile numbers and gain complete database 
of valid phone/mobile numbers of all users (I noticed this behaviour in two
different applications).

Hi Pavol,

Is it ok for you to write an article?

I noticed there is a reference to the Adam Shostack's MSDN threat modeling
article on OWASP news.

 

I also wanted to put to your attention the TM article I co-wrote on behalf
on OWASP for Insecure Magazine:

Security Flaws Identification and technical risk analysis through threat
modeling (page 85)

http://www.net-security.org/dl/insecure/INSECURE-Mag-17.pdf

 

The article covers how to implement threat modeling in organizations both as
technical risk analysis methodology and as secure architectural review
methodology. It covers how to TM as activity feeds other security activities
in the SDLC. It also cover different TM methodologies available today:
OWASP, MS-TAM and Trike as well as best practices for architects, testers
and information security officers on how to use TM as part of the SDLC to
both build and assess security into the applications independently from the
TM methodology being adopted.

 

I appreciate comments and feedback.

Hey Marco,

I enjoyed the article, I'm a big fan of Threat Modeling! I'm writing an
article in the next edition of Insecure Magazine which focuses more on
an overall SDLC approach which of course mentions Threat Modeling and
OWASP resources.

Yes, I will do it in the following days (including Marco Morana's comments).

Waiting for your comments.

There are some technical problems with OWASP web server.
During writing the article I noticed a lot of these messages:

exception 'RuntimeException' with message 'DirectoryIterator::__construct(/nfsn/content/ds-x/public/tmp/) [function.DirectoryIterator---construct]: failed to open dir: No such file or directory' in /opt/owasp/wiki/htdocs/extensions/SpecialWikiFeeds.php:816 Stack trace: #0 /opt/owasp/wiki/htdocs/extensions/SpecialWikiFeeds.php(816): DirectoryIterator->__construct('/nfsn/content/d...') #1 /opt/owasp/wiki/htdocs/extensions/SpecialWikiFeeds.php(793): SpecialWikiFeeds->_getCacheFiles() #2 /opt/owasp/wiki/htdocs/extensions/SpecialWikiFeeds.php(191): SpecialWikiFeeds->_cachePrune() #3 /opt/owasp/wiki/htdocs/extensions/SpecialWikiFeeds.php(903): SpecialWikiFeeds->__construct() #4 [internal function]: wfWikiFeeds() #5 /opt/owasp/wiki/htdocs/includes/Setup.php(287): call_user_func('wfWikiFeeds') #6 /opt/owasp/wiki/htdocs/includes/WebStart.php(102): require_once('/opt/owasp/wiki...') #7 /opt/owasp/wiki/htdocs/index.php(38): require_once('/opt/owasp/wiki...') #8 {main

BTW: from the security perspective it's not a good idea to have such "verbose"
logging :-)
