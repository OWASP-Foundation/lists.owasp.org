Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Obtaining more information
Message-ID: <499FF4AFD7F16F4C99618F59BC5DA5563CAF42@olimpia.opencs.com.br>

 
I have just joined this list having been put in charge of developing
know-how about web application testing at my company.
 
We will probably buy the Kavado?s ScanDo tool to test applications in
the first place or enter into a partnership with them.
 
I have tested the OWASP tools as well as SPIKE and they seem really
useful, though in development. 
I liked the VulnXML idea :)
 
What I need desperately is a methodology or framework for testing in
order not to depend blindly on the tools.
 
When I heard about this working group I was delighted but only to find
that there is no public information available yet.
 
Would it be possible to obtain a copy of the current draft? I certainly
will be able to contribute later on with our experience in testing
applications. 
 
Please respond,
 
Kind regards,

Hmm 3 persons awakened in a couple of hours. It's not dead then :)

Any chance you know something about the upcoming draft of the testing
framework? I am desperately searching for some guidelines for testing
web applications.

:o)

I did try that but I guess he is too busy with something.

I haven't heard anything, even tried his email at iDefense.

Anyhow, December is what I have heard as well

Hi guys,

Sorry for the lag in updates, you can be assured the project has been alive
and kicking.

With Mark's help, I have been rewriting and formatting the entire document
over the last two weeks.   While almost everyone submitted well written
material, the sytle and content needed some major tweaking.  The most common
area that needed attention was the tendency for sections to focus on how to
secure an application, and not necessarily how to test it.  Right now, our
project advisor, Ivan Arce, is going over the latest draft and should have
comments by today.  After I receive his comments, I plan on releasing
another official peer review version to this group to edit.  Based on all of
your comments and additions to this draft, the plan is still to release mid
December as scheduled. 

If you haven't already, please download the latest version of OpenOffice
from openoffice.org to be ready for this final editing phase.

Isn't it just!

Just wait 'till the release version;-) The lessons are being tuned etc.
With the text from this testing project we can add deailled textual
lessons in how to test for each issue, and then allow people to actually
do it. What a coool concept.

If you have ideas for lessons plans you can mail Bil Hau the project
Manager (bill at owasp.org) or the WebGoat list so it gets to the
developers and tech lead for this version (Jeff Williams, the man that
created it).

Excellent stuff Bill. 

I know the OWASP Testing project draft is getting close to a first
release and they will have some great text on all of these issues that
we should co-ordinate with. I think the two projects are very close
cousins ie one explains exactly how to test for a specific problem and
the other takes you through an interactive tutorial showing you how and
giving you a chance to actually do it.

I think maybe a cover page when you first start up WebGoat explaining
how you can use a proxy tool to do the testing maybe a good idea. Maybe
we can create a one landing page that explains the project, the history
of the Aspect guys creating it and how it can be used, future plans etc.
btw Steve Taylors Open Proxy (part of WebScarab) is now in final
debugging. Could even include it in the distribution I guess.

I wonder if its possible to use say a ZeroG installer and install
Tomcat, a JRE and this for those that are really not familiar with
things ? I know its dumbing it down but .....Also if youve ever played
with U-Portal (www.ja-sig.org) they have two ant scripts that start a
tomcat from the dll dir and start the database. Very slick, just unzip a
package and run the two ant scripts...maybe an idea

I will volunteer for the install guide with screen shots unless someone
else is going to create an installer.
