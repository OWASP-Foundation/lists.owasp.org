I had some time to tackle more review this morning. I only made it through the first few sections, here are some notes:

Testing: Conduct search engine discovery/reconnaissance for information leakage (OTG-INFO-001)
* Lead-in paragraph indicates: " Indirect methods relate to gleaning sensitive design and configuration information by searching forums, newsgroups and tendering websites." Yet no such information is covered in the entry. IMHO either this article needs to be beefed up or the statement should be removed.
* Made minor corrections related to punctuation (addition of Oxford commas and some missing periods, as well as borders on images).

Fingerprint Web Server (OTG-INFO-002)
* Minor updates, grammar and content.
* Makes me wonder if we have a style guide? Are we supposed to be using Title Caps for section naming?

Testing: Review Webserver Metafiles for Information Leakage (OTG-INFO-003)
* Reference links in this article are confusing. For example: [1] in the "Summary" section is not the same as [1] in the "How to Test" section...
* Minor updates, grammar and content.

Dear OWASP Testing Guide followers.
thanks to David who did the last rush, we have closed the Testing Guide
Project's first phase!
Many thanks to all the contributors!

All the articles are closed now.
Now it is time for the reviewers.

You can see the status here:
https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmEhPtZ0cHq3dDc5ZFI0Nm9oSkhzNkNxTzNJbGdPdVE#gid=0

Now the ToC is definitive:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

We deleted many items and 3 chapters:
- Web Services Testing (no completed at all, it's better to have a
separate guide on this)
- Logging (not in scope of the wapt)
- Denial of Service (not in scope of the wapt)

Now we have split the set of active tests in 12 sub-categories for a
total of 91 controls:
Information Gathering
Configuration and Deploy Management Testing
Identity Management Testing
Authentication Testing
Authorization Testing
Session Management Testing
Data Validation Testing
Error Handling
Cryptography
Logging
Business Logic Testing
Client Side Testing

NEXT STEP:
We'll contact all the proposed reviewers asking them to review the
Guide in the next 2 weeks:
> Paolo Perego
> Daniel Cuthbert
> Matthew Churcher
> Lode Vanstechelman
> Sebastien Gioria
> Antonio Fontes

Any others that want to help? Please answer only if you can review the
guide in the next days.

Deadline: end of March 2014

Thanks!
Mat & Andrew

Hi all,
the reviewing phase is finished.
Some reviewers did the review, but it is not complete.

Please if you have reviews to add to the wiki do it now.

In the next days we will start the last phase of the project.

Thanks!
Mat

I didn't contribute this to v4 due to smear enabled by the
incompetence of Dinis Cruz, Jeff Williams, Tom Brennan, Paulo Coimbra
and Brad Causey i.e.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Inquiries/Google_Hacking_Project&oldid=169442

I have no issue with OTG-INFO-001 being removed from v4 as it would
appear to have taken the more popular and less technical view of
http://www.hackersforcharity.org/ghdb/ that lacks the innovation or
"common sense" :) that I presented at the OWASP Conference in New York
in 2009 i.e. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgXSlEenNeA

The reference to OWASP-IG-009 is stated within the "Summary" and "Test
Objectives" sections i.e. "... the list of directories that are to be
avoided by Spiders/Robots/Crawler ..."

This is the "Disallow" directive of the Robots Exclusion Protocol
expanded within the "How to Test" section.  Perhaps adding a mention
of the "Disallow" directive without complicating the "Summary" and
"Test Objectives" section would clarify this?

Hi Christian, I think I was unclear. When I suggested something should be removed it was simply the references to "Indirect methods" which are mentioned in the lead-in but not actually covered at all in the article. I wasn't suggesting that INFO-001 should be dropped entirely.

As for the reference links my confusion is that there seem to be two [1]s which lead to different locations. (There might be two [2]s or [3]s too, I don't recall right this second and don't have time to check.)

Anyway just my 2cents, wasn't meant to step on any toes or anything.

Rick

I am not sure how you concluded that OWASP-IG-009 isn't covered in
OWASP-INFO-003 unless you mean that OWASP-IG-009 could be expanded?

I still support the removal of OWASP-INFO-001 from v4.

Mediawiki appears to add [x] as the URL of the hyperlink and their
numbering duplicates the footnotes added by the author.

Mediawiki has created eight of these while their are four in the
"References" section that I created.

I believe the resolution would be to use [a], [b], [c], etc instead
and have Mediawiki continue the configuration that generates [1], [2],
[3], etc?

We're on different pages. Perhaps the index to the guide is not still in the order/format you're thinking of..... I dunno but you're making associations that I never made or suggested.

Starting at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents goto section 4.2.1: "4.2.1 Conduct Search Engine Discovery and Reconnaissance for Information Leakage (OTG-INFO-001) formerly "Search Engine Discovery/Reconnaissance (OWASP-IG-002)""

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Search_engine_discovery/reconnaissance_%28OWASP-IG-002%29

In which the lead-in talks about direct and indirect methods, yet the content of said page/article only covers direct methods. For my 2cents if indirect methods are not going to be covered within 4.2.1 then they should be mentioned in the lead-in to that section. (Perhaps they're covered elsewhere, perhaps they're not, but introducing something and then not covering it in the same section seems broken.)

I am not sure how you concluded that OWASP-IG-009 isn't covered in
OWASP-INFO-003 unless you mean that OWASP-IG-009 could be expanded?

I still support the removal of OWASP-INFO-001 from v4.

Mediawiki appears to add [x] as the URL of the hyperlink and their numbering duplicates the footnotes added by the author.

Mediawiki has created eight of these while their are four in the "References" section that I created.

I believe the resolution would be to use [a], [b], [c], etc instead and have Mediawiki continue the configuration that generates [1], [2], [3], etc?

Rick,

https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing:_Conduct_search_engine_discovery/reconnaissance_for_information_leakage_(OTG-INFO-001)&oldid=37153
was my last contribution (August 2008) to this wiki page.

I would encourage OWASP to delete OTG-INFO-001 from v4 as it deviates
significantly from what I presented too i.e.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgXSlEenNeA
