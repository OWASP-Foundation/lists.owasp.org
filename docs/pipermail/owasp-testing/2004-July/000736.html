That's a good idea. Actually, that's what we started writting for the 
testing guide last year. All the info is currently sitting (unused) in 
the CVS, it's also far from complete:
<A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/owasp/testing/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/owasp/testing/</A>

&gt;<i> I think a way forward (even before we have the definitive list of sections)

The outline looks great to me. My only concern is that the last time 
we tried this we did not cover all the vulnerabilities we wanted to 
(not everyone did their homework). So maybe it's better to do first a 
generic overview of the common vulnerabilities in section 6 and then 
provide examples for specific vulnerabilities (i.e. those we can write 
down stuff for following your outline). So the section might say 
&quot;Below you will find some examples of vulnerabilities and how they 
should be tested as well as their known caveats&quot;

IF we are able to cover all the vulnerabilities as defined in the 
Pentest checklist then we can scratch the reference to those sections 
being examples and substitute that with a &quot;Below you will find a list 
of all known common vulnerabilities and how test should be conducted 
to detect them as well as known caveats&quot;
