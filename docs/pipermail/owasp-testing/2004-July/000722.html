See your point, its already late

I have followed UMLSec in its beginning but not recently, will check up

&gt;<i> Time frame analysis should probably use UML State Transition Diagrams

</I>
Agreed

&gt;<i> Abuse cases are a marketing term for what is formally referred to in UML

</I>
More or less Mark, in my understanding, abuse cases try to break the 
system based on the use case design, that is on the design level. You 
might call it a security minded alternative path but I like the term 
because it is explicitly security related.
You force the designer to think of what the system must not accept in 
terms of security, I don't think you can have a negative alternative 
path in the same case?

Another point however is that Threat Modeling should consider other 
levels of the system, not just the design level where use cases lives.

&gt;<i> I think we may well need to spawn off a separate project eventually on
</I>&gt;<i> modeling security and threat modeling. 
</I>
That would be cool Mark, like the &quot;OWASP Threat Modeling Guide&quot; :o)
That is certainly not a bad idea! but let finish off the current version

What are the steps from now?, you want a revision of the current doc? I 
found some spelling errors, what would be the best way to submit those?

Do you want them?

The document is already full of revisions, I think it would be better to 
submit pagenumber, line and text in an email, agreed?
