<PRE>This is one of my biggest concerns.
Since ive been on this guide for a long time now, ive seen the sections go
out for everyone to write and only a handful of people actually deliver
their section back complete.

Seriously, i understand that everyone has jobs/lifes/wives/husbands/cars/
etc, but if you feel you dont have the time to donate please let me know!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I like the idea but what about having that as part of the 2nd phase
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contents? At the end of each section a &quot;things to test&quot; subsection -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this it can be easily related to the in-depth discussion of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vulnerability that (I assume) will be part of that section and can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily mantained than a separate document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a good idea. Actually, that's what we started writting for the
</I>&gt;<i> testing guide last year. All the info is currently sitting (unused) in
</I>&gt;<i> the CVS, it's also far from complete:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/owasp/testing/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/owasp/testing/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think a way forward (even before we have the definitive list of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sections)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be to write up one of the sections, so that we agree on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the section. What about something along the lines of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The outline looks great to me. My only concern is that the last time
</I>&gt;<i> we tried this we did not cover all the vulnerabilities we wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> (not everyone did their homework). So maybe it's better to do first a
</I>&gt;<i> generic overview of the common vulnerabilities in section 6 and then
</I>&gt;<i> provide examples for specific vulnerabilities (i.e. those we can write
</I>&gt;<i> down stuff for following your outline). So the section might say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Below you will find some examples of vulnerabilities and how they
</I>&gt;<i> should be tested as well as their known caveats&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IF we are able to cover all the vulnerabilities as defined in the
</I>&gt;<i> Pentest checklist then we can scratch the reference to those sections
</I>&gt;<i> being examples and substitute that with a &quot;Below you will find a list
</I>&gt;<i> of all known common vulnerabilities and how test should be conducted
</I>&gt;<i> to detect them as well as known caveats&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
