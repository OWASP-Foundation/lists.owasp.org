<PRE>Hi Simon,

I have never liked, or will, the idea of a IDS thinking about performing
any defence mechanism on the network without some human checking to see if
its ok.
A while ago when i was pentesting a load of networks, i managed to
discover that Realsecure was running with the infamous &quot;if you see bad
traffic, add a firewall rule&quot; option. The end result was me adding a load
of rules which cut this whole segment off from the web and ended up
closing down their online trading app for an hour.

I believe that accounts should be locked out after X amount of failed
logins. Without this feature enabled, the app is very open to abuse
attacks.
I do agree though that both of them do contradict themselves, and i
realised this when i was putting the whole checklist together, but in some
weird way they need to be both there.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've finally found myself a couple of hours to go through the OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> Checklist and have come across something which has confused me a little.
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP-AD-002 states &quot;Ensure that the application does not allow an
</I>&gt;<i> attacker
</I>&gt;<i> to reset or lockout users' accounts.&quot;, however, OWASP-AUTHN-008 then
</I>&gt;<i> states
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Ensure that the users account is locked out for a period of time when the
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect password is entered more than a specific number of times
</I>&gt;<i> (usually
</I>&gt;<i> 5).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whilst these two items contradict each other I can see the relavence
</I>&gt;<i> behind
</I>&gt;<i> both.  On one hand if user accounts are not locked out then the
</I>&gt;<i> application
</I>&gt;<i> is open to a brute force attack, on the other, if the accounts are locked
</I>&gt;<i> out then this opens the application up to a DoS attack (on a per user
</I>&gt;<i> basis).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am of the belief that accounts should not be locked out from logins, as,
</I>&gt;<i> there are adequate measures that can be taken against brute force attacks
</I>&gt;<i> (such as an IDS which can reject traffic under certain circumstances) and
</I>&gt;<i> also the item OWASP-AUTHN-006 which states &quot;Ensure that the password
</I>&gt;<i> complexity makes guessing passwords difficult.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be interested to hear your views on the above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Simon Booth
