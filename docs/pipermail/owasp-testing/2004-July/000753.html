<PRE>Attached is the outline so far, can we all start looking at the structure
and deciding the direction?

I think we need to concentrate on making sure the various languages are
covered. I had a good chat with a friend over at another large investment
bank and he wanted to know what we were doing with J2EE stuff, hence this
has now been added.

Once everyone is happy with what is in the outline, i'll draw up a better
format and then we can start assigning sections for people to get on with.

There are a large amount of people on this list now and yet only a few
regulars still seem to offer comments. I will be removing the inactive
ones in the next couple of weeks (hey it's only fair to contribute and not
use it as a private guide before the rest of the world get it..)


Thanks to everyone who has contributed so far

Daniel
