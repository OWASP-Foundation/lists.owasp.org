Subject: [Owasp-testing] A survey on web application attacks
Message-ID: <C23B737537EEE8488A1E6625881EB17D12C0F68DE1@icssrv06>

Hi,

I am researching the domain consensus regarding the effectiveness of different web application firewalls (WAF)s and would be glad if you could spare a few minutes of your time to answer a survey on the topic. 

By completing this survey you will:

  * Help build valuable domain consensus on the topic of WAF effectiveness.
  * Be able to compare your answers to the answers of others.
  * Have the chance to win a 100 USD gift certificate on Amazon.

The survey can be found at: http://surveys.ics.kth.se/WASec  

Thank you for your attention and sorry about the cross-posting.

Regards,
Hannes
