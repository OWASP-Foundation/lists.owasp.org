<PRE>Thanks Ryan, Kevin, Mike

I thought we might of had an &quot;OWASP definition&quot; of Reverse BF seen as we
should be testing for it, providing detective &amp; preventative measures etc.

Standardised definitions are useful in terms of people learning what an
issue is regardless of if it relates to code dev, test, review or
deployment. It would be good to develop an OWASP dictionary/ thesaurus, such
like the oxford dictionary for English.

Would this assist in people mixing up CSRF and XSS :0) and stuff like that?

Robust defs for issues may also help define a consistent methodology in
testing for such issues or coding against them?

who knows?

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reverse brute force&quot;. That's because traditionally, the term &quot;brute force&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> comes from the cryptographic community and is an attack that enumerates
</I>&gt;<i> through
</I>&gt;<i> an encryption algorithm's key space trying to find a match.
