<PRE>... tell us your stories!

It's been a while since I went looking for ASVS users (organizations) to add to the project page. I know there are quite a few more out there than are currently listed from chatting with you individually. I've been a little lazy, not following up with people to ask if I may list them on the project page to their organization's support for the project as I've been chatting with them.

ASVS Japanese, French, German, Chinese, Hungarian, Malay translators - what organizations are interested in these versions of ASVS? There's at least one of you out there for each of these languages for which translations from English are currently underway :-) Developers, testers -- Inquiring minds want to know!

Note that the definition of &quot;user&quot; is pretty broad, you don't have to have scrapped whatever you're currently doing or stapled printouts of ASVS onto your cubicle walls in order to be considered a &quot;user&quot;. Scroll down to the &quot;Did you know...&quot; section here to see what I mean: <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project#tab=Home">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project#tab=Home</A>

Show your organization's support for the project by lending your name to the list of users!

Best,

Mike B.

PS - Please feel free to forward this email as appropriate.

PPS - Development Guide people, turns out you're now an ASVS user! Or at least you're working on it! Show your organization's support for the new Guide direction, become an ASVS user! Same goes for the other guides, at least at some point in the future as the guides are updated with the new ASVS common numbering scheme! Show your support for unifying the guides by listing yourself as an ASVS user!
