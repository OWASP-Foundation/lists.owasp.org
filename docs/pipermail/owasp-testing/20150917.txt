Subject: [Owasp-testing] Feedback using hard copy of OWASP testing guide as
	a reference
Message-ID: <CANOrWx31-+JfNCwigN-XdRrA2WU9M8r1U-22z7iz195FfuvqSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

So i got my OWASP testing guides in the mail the other day (i ordered 10!).
Again excellent work! I do however have some feedback for you regarding
ease of navigation.

Id like to use the hard copy as a reference to give to developers and QA
etc. However it is quite hard to navigate around the book. For example if
im testing clickjacking id like to be able to look up the contents and then
go to the correct page.

The version that i received does not have page numbers and the contents
page does not reference any page numbers. This makes it difficult to
navigate quickly which IMO makes it less affective as a reference.

If you do end up updating the hardcopy version ill likely buy quite a few
more to hand out to devs/QAs where i work so please let me know if this is
something we could consider adding in :)

Cheers

Julian
