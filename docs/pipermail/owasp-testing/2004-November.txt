Chapter 5 Comments:

 

In general this is a very good chapter.  Good job to whoever wrote it.  I just have a few comments.

 

1)      Page 19 Advantages and Disadvantages ? The last paragraph mentions automated tools.  I suggest adding a section to the document explaining technical and business logical application vulnerabilities.  Then we can suggest where to use automated tools.

 

Automated tools can be very helpful finding the technical vulnerabilities in application.  They can be a very useful time saver and quickly find most of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  On the other hand, automated tools are not good for find vulnerabilities in the business logic of applications. Therefore a manual code review is required.

 

2)      Page 20 Approaches to Source Code Review ? Maybe we can elaborate on the 4 different approaches.  For example the ?Call Tree Exploration? can be performed from top->down or bottom->up.

 

3)      Page 21 Using Documentation ? This is the only section of the document that I disagree with.  The first paragraph suggests that ?documentation lies? and reviewers should be extremely skeptical.  This may be the case for a non-critical applications or a small company which will, probably, never go through a security code review.

 

Critical production applications that warrant a security code review are build following well document development standards and go through change control processes.  Maybe the documentation does not lie but it hasn?t been updated to reflect the latest changes to the application.  The code review should be used as a check against the documentation to verify that the developer is following the documented standards.  

 

Well that?s my 2 cents?  Very good job.

 

Thanks,

Stan Guzik

I am not sure which version this is? 
 
Much of this was cut in a heavy editing process early on for consistency and
flow of the document. It was decided it was better for Part 2.

Hi All,

Attached is, what i feel, is the closest we will get for the final release
of Phase One.
PLEASE, if you have time by COB friday 19th nov, could you look at it and
contribute any final changes you feel should be done.

I really think we should release this by the end of November, so we can
start on the second phase and really get this project moving again.

Any issues, let me know

ps.. I have approved a load of new people joining this list, yet it's
deadly silent. new joiners, pipe up and introduce yourselves or ill be
brutal and clean the subscriptions up :0)

Attached is a version including:

- the changes I suggested in Message-ID: 
<4129E914.2010205 at germinus.com> and provided in 
<41764521.7030308 at germinus.com>
Nobody commented on them (either saying they were ok or not ok). IMHO 
they improve the text (but they probably need reviewing by a native 
speaker)

- date change (July -> November)

- a note about the consequences of insecure _web_ applications (in 
order to focus the text, sometimes it is too generic and applies to 
any application wether it's web related or not)

- a disadvantage of source code review and advantage of pentest

- a comment about focused pentesting advantages

- fixed a reference in "Phase 2D: Create and Review Threat Models" 
(the reference included the whole "Manual Inspection & Reviews" 
paragraph text instead of just the title)

- Fixed book names, added publishers and ISBN numbers to all books.


Hopefully this time they will make it to the final release.

Regards

Javier

Firstly, thousand apologies to Javier, his changes weren't added to the
original i sent out :0(

Attached doc includes his changes and some author/formatting/grammar
changes from me.

Outstanding is phase 1A, SDLC process review.
Anyone with experience care to quickly tackle this?

And in the tools section, i have removed Sanctum as i dont feel they
deserve any mention anywhere, due to their pathetic patent registration.
Does anyone feel this is too harsh?

With luck, friday seems like happening

I don't have an issue with that, after all, it's free advertisement 
and it's up to us wether we want to provide it or not.

Haven't had the time to go through (another) full
review but preferred to send back a few remarks
anyway.

Apparently, a few of my former comments ended lost
somewhere like Javier's.
Here they are:

<quote>
- page 11, regarding the statement 'The primary issue
with OCTAVE is its use of likelihood = 1, or ?all
risks are equally risky?', I believe it is not
entirely true;  at least, OCTAVE-S (OCTAVE's tailored
version for smaller enterprises) provides the means
for describing the likelihood of future occurrences of
a threat (as well as recording how often it occurred
in the past), i.e. defining probabilities.
  If I remember correctly, in OCTAVE probabilities are
an optional feature.
</quote>

Action: I have deleted the whole sentence.
I have performed OCTAVE-S -based assessments, and made
use of probabilities.
Didn't invent anything new since these concepts are
built into the methodology and have their place in the
worksheets.
As I wrote before, in the "original" OCTAVE (not the
tailored version for smaller enterprises)
probabilities were left as an optional component;
however I've never used it practically and even don't
know if it underwent
changes in this respect since I read its
specifications.
Anyone else out there with experience on OCTAVE who
would like to comment?



<quote>
- page 16 seems to be incomplete...
</quote>

Now it's page 19 - still pending.
Action: Should be completed by the author.



<quote>
- page 26 Figure "Typical SDLC Testing Workflow".
Shouldn't it include (in the development, deployment
sections) test activities to validate the artifact
being built against functional and non-functional
requirements? (the real test cases... including
acceptance tests if needed after deployment)
</quote>

Action: This was actually approved by Daniel but
seemingly not implemented.
I tried to modify the drawing myself but was not able
to pick up the same font used in the original.
Inserted in the doc an updated version anyway.



Additional notes:

- updated the TOC which wasn't in sync
- page 2, it's probably better to update the phase II
estimate with a more reasonable guess (Q2 2005? -
haven't touched the text)
- changed notation on page 28 to express 30 to the
28th power
- URL of 1st whitepaper on page 28 still with a
pending note (not mine)
- changed "Secure in the Java platform" to "Security
in ...", page 29
- dared to add myself to the contributors (though
"author" in my case is decidedly an overstatement;
haven't written "reviewer" since listing only one
sounds bad and would not be correct - I think we
should mention explicitly all the reviewers)

- phase 1A, SDLC still outstanding


Best regards to all

Mauro

 <<the owasp testing project1 - pre-rel-mbr.doc>> I made a few minor
changes with tracking on. The only one worth note is I tried to align
the notion of policy, process, people and tecchnology to people, process
and technolgy as it seems to be a widely accepted concept and to add an
additional thing didn't seem smart. 

So are we happy with this doc ? I think its great and truly a great
basis to start the long work of How do you implement this idea. Massive
amounts to do. I really think a Wiki maybe the best way to get small
incremental content such as how do I code review for SQL Injection or
how do I test X....

Looks good, as for your note about Nessus & Nikto:

Nikto is just a CGI scanner it does have some modules that are able to 
do some black box testing of web servers (not really applications) 
which is 1/3 of the things that AppScan/ScanDo (which also do CGI 
scanning for server flaws, maybe with an updated database, and do user 
identification and dictionary attacks).

Nessus does include some modules (developed by DDI, IIRC) to detect 
specific web server flaws as well as to do web crawling and extract 
applications & parameters from a website. Check out
http://cgi.nessus.org/plugins/dump.php3?family=CGI%20abuses
(some are app specific, some are generic, for example, some of the XSS 
stuff). It might include an AVDL interpreter in the future (but I 
don't know if anyone is working on it) (BTW, what happened to VulnXML?)

Maybe I should have added Internet Scanner to the Commercial list as 
well, by I didn't feel they needed any free advertisement :-)

I'm happy with the document.

Yes, that might be a good way to get that content developed...

Thanks to everyone who managed to give time to edit this and get it to
this state, i think its looking amazing and cannot wait to get it out
there and get some feedback on all the work we have been doing.

So what are we left with?

- 1A
Jeff has kindly said he will look into doing this bit
- Quotes
Mark can we both approach the people listed and see if they will give quotes?
- Tools section
I agree, i dont see the need to list nikto (ver 1 that is) and nessus.
they arent really full application testing tools, ok they do have some
modules, but  think we should really concentrate on the tools that are
100% app related. I guess the same goes to ISS's internet scanner.

I have also removed the watchfire link

My main reason for pushing this release so agressively is that we are way
behind schedule. The longer we wait, the more people start to think that
we have no ability to actually deliver on what we talk about.

Comments welcome as usual :0)

It's my birthday on the 4th so would make a good bday pressie to get this
doc out so that the world can enjoy it?

Jeff, Mark does that date sound good to get the remaining SDLC and Quotes
sorted?



next friday sounds good, im off to dublin for the weekend so ill

Subject: [Owasp-dotnet] Farewell OWASP, take care!


People,

Its with a degree of sadness that I have decided to leave the OWASP project
behind and move on to pastures new. This decision has been a long time
coming and not something I have decided to do without a lot of thought. When
we started it in 2000 I had no idea I would become so attached to this
virtual community. I really have.

Sadly my na?ve vision of the utopian dream of lots of people coming together
and working in collaboration to build cool software and documentation just
hasn't materialized the way I had hoped. I have actually become very
disillusioned with open source projects and simply feel my ever increasingly
limited time is best spent in other directions in which I personally get
more fulfillment and less frustration. At this point of my game I think the
majority of people want free software and not open source; a sad conclusion
that's debatable but I think true. I wanted to produce high quality
documents and software and lots of it. Like Renuad Derason of Nessus fame I
am bitterly disappointed at the amount of people that take and don't give
back to the community and as a consequence things just don't seem to have
been moving in a positive direction at a pace I am comfortable with. For
OWASP the model was broken. We hear of companies having based commercial
policies on OWASP Guides and using the portal for Intranets, but we never
hear from them. I really believe that OWASP still has the potential to have
a huge impact on the web application security world but suspect it needs to
dramatically re-group and re-organize to achieve that goal. I know Jeff has
started that process.

I am certainly not disappearing from the software security scene, quite the
opposite. Foundstone is a phenomenal place to work and with the commercial
side of life, cool clients and interesting projects we just seem to be able
to get more fun stuff done. You will see a new project with a very different
model from OWASP (commercially backed, shared source)in the new year called
ThreatsandCountermeausures.com and lots of free software security tools from
Foundstone. These are not competitive to what OWASP is doing in anyway, just
different....and to me more rewarding at this point. I am one of those ADD
people that has to see progress every week or I get frustrated ;-) T&C by
the way was going to be an OWASP project until a radical left wing person
expressed their voice about MS and I just didn't have the appetite to deal
with it anymore. This kind of thing is not constructive and needs to be
stopped if OWASP is to grow. Dinis finds a great balance and should be an
inspiration to us all IMHO.

Like I said it is of the utmost importance that OWASP carries on to spurn
the marketing FUD from the likes of WASC and the web app firewall vendors.
The potential is huge and very important, the possibility of it failing is
not nice so I hope you folks huddle up and make it happen. I just ask one
thing please keep out the riff raff !!

I have met some people I regard as lifelong friends through OWASP. You know
who you are. Its has been a great ride. I thank you for your inspiration and
those long nights online, especially in the early days. Ingo, Alex, Endler,
Steve T, Dave, Dinis etc..I learnt a lot from you guys and everyone who has
been involved.

Anything you would have mailed me about for OWASP you can contact Jeff
Williams (jeff.williams at owasp.org)

I'll see you all at the OWASP conference in NYC which I wouldn't miss for
the world !

Have a great Christmas and a peaceful new year!

Mark
