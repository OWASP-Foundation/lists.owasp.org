What may be of value is to have a small section that shows the top 5 or 10 pages accessed, this gives an idea of interest.

These numbers are impressive and if we monitored them quarterly we may get a better pulse on the community interest/concerns over time.

Thanks,
David

 Hello OWASP Testing Guide Team,
 
 The v4 TOC for the Testing Guide is one of the top 15 most
 popular pages 
 at OWASP in and of itself.
 
 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents
 
 Many thousands of folks (15,000 or so per month) hit this
 page directly 
 when looking for testing guide information.
 
 Is there anything we can do to make this page more
 attractive? Perhaps 
 give it a theme or add a paragraph at the top?
 
 Thanks for considering,
 Jim Manico
 OWASP Wiki Editor/Cleanup Team

I like the idea. I once found the page that showed the top hits but can't
find it anymore. Any one have the link?
