<PRE>Hi,

I wanted to do review of actual OTGv4 state as Andrew asked. Sadly I had not enough time to check it all (yet). So I am sending just few comments.
Please correct me if I understood something incorrectly.


* OTG-AUTHN-006 vs. OTG/CRYPST-004 &amp; OTG-CRYPST-005
AUTHN-006:	Testing for Browser cache weakness
CRYPST-004:	Testing for Cacheable HTTPS Response
CRYPST-005:	Test Cache Directives
CRYPST-005 and CRYPST-004 are empty. I think we should remove them. They would describe basically the same stuff that should be described in AUTHN-006. Wouldn&#8217;t they? It is redundant to mention the same stuff in several tests.


* OWASP-EN-001 vs. OTG-CRYPST-002
What is purpose of OWASP-EN-001? Isn&#8217;t it redundant to OTG-CRYPST-002?
Or should it contain info on general crypto stuff?
I can imagine describing there issues related to custom signing schemes or custom algorithms in general.
In the past I found such issues (weak custom signature that - offline cracking and revealing private key in short time) but described it as business logic issue. Crypto section is clearly better.


* OTG-IDENT-005 vs. OTG-IDENT-004
I thinks &quot;Weak or unenforced username policy&#8221; (OTG-IDENT-005) does not need own test. It should be described within &quot;Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account&#8221; (OTG-IDENT-004).
OTG-IDENT-005 in fact has same content that is already in OTG-IDENT-004.
We should:
- either remove OTG-IDENT-005
- or remove &quot;Guessable User Account&#8221; part from OTG-IDENT-004


* OTG-CONFIG-010 vs. OTG-CLIENT-004
&quot;Test Frame Options&quot; (OTG-CONFIG-010) is empty but it would cover the same stuff that is already in &quot;Testing for Clickjacking&quot; (OTG-CLIENT-004). Wouldn&#8217;t it?
We should remove OTG-CONFIG-010.

* OTG-CLIENT-004 contained information on X-Frame-Options but did not contained info on recommended value (DENY). I added it: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing_for_Clickjacking_%28OWASP-CS-004%29&amp;diff=164691&amp;oldid=140536">https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing_for_Clickjacking_%28OWASP-CS-004%29&amp;diff=164691&amp;oldid=140536</A>


* OWASP OTG-INFO-010 vs. OTG-INFO-002
They are redundant. They actually contain the same content. We should remove one of them (OWASP OTG-INFO-010).


* Test Session Token Strength (OTG-SESS-006)
It is empty. I can write that one.
And also extend part about CSRF tokens - CSRF tokens should have same cryptographic strength (size and entropy) as session id.


* Testing for Weak password policy (OTG-AUTHN-007)
It is not very clear nor verbose.
I think it could be good practice to ban most used passwords, like these ones: <A HREF="http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt">http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt</A>
I was thinking about starting project for maintained list of most used passwords. I searched for such project and found this on github: <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/mehlah/3128202">https://gist.github.com/mehlah/3128202</A>
It is maybe worth starting owasp project for this? Maintaining the list of most used passwords observed in leaked lists from past breaches in the world? What do you think?

Regards
