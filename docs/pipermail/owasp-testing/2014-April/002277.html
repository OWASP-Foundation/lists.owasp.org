&gt;<i> Hi Christian, I think I was unclear. When I suggested something should be removed it was simply the references to &quot;Indirect methods&quot; which are mentioned in the lead-in but not actually covered at all in the article. I wasn't suggesting that INFO-001 should be dropped entirely.
</I>
I am not sure how you concluded that OWASP-IG-009 isn't covered in
OWASP-INFO-003 unless you mean that OWASP-IG-009 could be expanded?

I still support the removal of OWASP-INFO-001 from v4.

&gt;<i> As for the reference links my confusion is that there seem to be two [1]s which lead to different locations. (There might be two [2]s or [3]s too, I don't recall right this second and don't have time to check.)
</I>
Mediawiki appears to add [x] as the URL of the hyperlink and their
numbering duplicates the footnotes added by the author.

Mediawiki has created eight of these while their are four in the
&quot;References&quot; section that I created.

I believe the resolution would be to use [a], [b], [c], etc instead
and have Mediawiki continue the configuration that generates [1], [2],
[3], etc?
