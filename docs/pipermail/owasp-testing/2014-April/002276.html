<PRE>Hi Christian, I think I was unclear. When I suggested something should be removed it was simply the references to &quot;Indirect methods&quot; which are mentioned in the lead-in but not actually covered at all in the article. I wasn't suggesting that INFO-001 should be dropped entirely.

As for the reference links my confusion is that there seem to be two [1]s which lead to different locations. (There might be two [2]s or [3]s too, I don't recall right this second and don't have time to check.)

Anyway just my 2cents, wasn't meant to step on any toes or anything.

Rick

Rick,

I didn't contribute this to v4 due to smear enabled by the incompetence of Dinis Cruz, Jeff Williams, Tom Brennan, Paulo Coimbra and Brad Causey i.e.
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Inquiries/Google_Hacking_Project&amp;oldid=169442">https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Inquiries/Google_Hacking_Project&amp;oldid=169442</A>

I have no issue with OTG-INFO-001 being removed from v4 as it would appear to have taken the more popular and less technical view of <A HREF="http://www.hackersforcharity.org/ghdb/">http://www.hackersforcharity.org/ghdb/</A> that lacks the innovation or &quot;common sense&quot; :) that I presented at the OWASP Conference in New York in 2009 i.e. <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgXSlEenNeA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgXSlEenNeA</A>

</I>
The reference to OWASP-IG-009 is stated within the &quot;Summary&quot; and &quot;Test Objectives&quot; sections i.e. &quot;... the list of directories that are to be avoided by Spiders/Robots/Crawler ...&quot;

This is the &quot;Disallow&quot; directive of the Robots Exclusion Protocol expanded within the &quot;How to Test&quot; section.  Perhaps adding a mention of the &quot;Disallow&quot; directive without complicating the &quot;Summary&quot; and &quot;Test Objectives&quot; section would clarify this?
