<PRE>We're on different pages. Perhaps the index to the guide is not still in the order/format you're thinking of..... I dunno but you're making associations that I never made or suggested.

Starting at <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents</A> goto section 4.2.1: &quot;4.2.1 Conduct Search Engine Discovery and Reconnaissance for Information Leakage (OTG-INFO-001) formerly &quot;Search Engine Discovery/Reconnaissance (OWASP-IG-002)&quot;&quot;

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Search_engine_discovery/reconnaissance_%28OWASP-IG-002%29">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Search_engine_discovery/reconnaissance_%28OWASP-IG-002%29</A>

In which the lead-in talks about direct and indirect methods, yet the content of said page/article only covers direct methods. For my 2cents if indirect methods are not going to be covered within 4.2.1 then they should be mentioned in the lead-in to that section. (Perhaps they're covered elsewhere, perhaps they're not, but introducing something and then not covering it in the same section seems broken.)

Rick,

&gt;<i> Hi Christian, I think I was unclear. When I suggested something should be removed it was simply the references to &quot;Indirect methods&quot; which are mentioned in the lead-in but not actually covered at all in the article. I wasn't suggesting that INFO-001 should be dropped entirely.
</I>
I am not sure how you concluded that OWASP-IG-009 isn't covered in
OWASP-INFO-003 unless you mean that OWASP-IG-009 could be expanded?

I still support the removal of OWASP-INFO-001 from v4.

Mediawiki appears to add [x] as the URL of the hyperlink and their numbering duplicates the footnotes added by the author.

Mediawiki has created eight of these while their are four in the &quot;References&quot; section that I created.

I believe the resolution would be to use [a], [b], [c], etc instead and have Mediawiki continue the configuration that generates [1], [2], [3], etc?
