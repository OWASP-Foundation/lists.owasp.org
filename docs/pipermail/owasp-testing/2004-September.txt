Hi All,

Since i've heard nothing wrong about the proposed layout i sent out a few
weeks ago, i will be spending this weekend working out the sections and
also drawing up the list of what needs doing.

I understand that everyone normally takes holiday this time of the year,
and im hoping that we can now do a push to get this second phase up and
running

Cheers

Daniel

I'm not sure if I managed my subscription properly, has this message 
reached the list properly? It is in the archive, so I believe it has 
reached others, but the lack of any comments has left me wondering...

Daniel,

I have attached a version of
Testing_Guide_II_structure with a few (minor)
remarks/additions.

If I may choose, would gladly contribute to the Input
Injection section in Appendix B,
and as a reviewer.

A few questions which come to my mind:
- how many people are expected to work on the doc?
- any schedule/deadlines defined?
- writing strategy, if any (e.g., working in pairs on
same content or other
  collaborative schemes,
 reviews/synch points, etc.)
- recommendations to produce a balanced document
(since there will be supposedly
  many writers, things such as (rough) expected
length, style conventions
, etc.)


Sorry if I missed something in the past and some
questions are not new.

Regards,

Mauro

Thanks Mauro,

- how many people are expected to work on the doc?
We have loads subscribed to this list, but past experience shows only a
few core people submit work (i really am hoping this changes with Phase
II)

- any schedule/deadlines defined?
Yes, i would like a rough draft out by the beginning of december

- writing strategy, if any
If it helps people to do it that way, by all means.

- recommendations to produce a balanced document
I will try and write up something this weekend on how the parts should be
structured but the peer review process is pretty effective, as you will
see with phase I (which surely must be ready now?)

Please beare me with me if this was commented on already but, why does 
the outline of section two include information that is already 
available in the testing guide? Is this going to be a separate docume
nt or is it rather a revision of the current testing guide?

In any case:

- should the Appendix E also cover source code analysis tools?

- wouldn't it be best if the "Finding specific vulnerabilities" 
appendices would focus first in the top ten vulnerabilities. This 
would tie nicely with other documents. I believe that should be the 
first target before trying to cover all possible vulnerabilities.

- the penetration testing methodology could probably tie in with the 
penetration checklist. Should it be included here?

Regards

Javier

Appendix E, good suggestion, ill add that

and yes, the pentest checklist will be added into this release (it was
released beforehand as they was a massive requirement for it, but the plan
was always that i integrated it into phase II)

I like the addition of the top ten, i can see how that would turn out well

Hi all,
 
About the structure, i think some issues that we could add if you think these
are revelant for testing web application.
 
Access Control
 
Control of Access to seasonal facilities: Imposibility of invoke and access
application facilities outside the established periods. For example at a
Human Resource application , the evaluation process facility only works from
January to May and the rest of the year it must be not active. 
 
Sensitive Data in Logs and traces. Really important in country where Personal
Data is protected by law.
Traceability : To  have the enough information in logs that allow
administrator or forensic staff to trace every task made by a user inside a
session. Perhaps this is not the best chapter to add it.
 

Configuration Management Infrastructure

 
Access and Visibility of Administrative tools of web,application, etc
servers.
 
Regards,
 
Pablo

Hi All,

Apologies for not getting this done sooner, but work related issues forced
me to concentrate on other things for a while.
Attached is the 4th version of the outline, taking into account all the
comments everyone sent me.

It's looking good and i would like to start dividing it up into sections
soon. This will allow everyone to choose a section and start writing up
the content.

What does everyone think?

Daniel
