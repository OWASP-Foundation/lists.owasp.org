<PRE>Seems the site is experiencing some issues this morning. What really caught my eye was the &quot;... database server: Too many connections (127.0.0.1)&quot; part. While the DB might not be exposed externally this is still contrary to what I believe most of us would suggest to our clients (i.e.: DB should not be the same machine as the WebServer. Due to single point of failure, etc.)

&quot;OWASP has a problem

Sorry! This site is experiencing technical difficulties.
Try waiting a few minutes and reloading.

(Can't contact the database server: Too many connections (127.0.0.1))

You can try searching via Google in the meantime.
Note that their indexes of our content may be out of date.&quot;
