Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] It's aliiiiive
Message-ID: <000401c2ed8f$266ab9b0$644510ac@idef.com>

Attached is the latest draft of the Testing document in RTF format.  The
conversion was a little quirky from OpenOffice, so certain
sections are capitalized.  There is still MUCH to do, but I would like to
define a
staggered release schedule of chapters to allow us to edit in a timely and
effective manner, focusing on specific portions methodically.  The
following release schedule is what I had in mind.  I'm not completely sure
if this
is too aggresive, or not aggresive enough, but we can always adjust the
timeframe.  Thoughts?

I'll be sending specific requests for the first release cluster later
tonight.  The first release I imagine will be the easiest to get ready for
prime time publication. Thanks for your continued patience and support:

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Testing Cookie predictability
Message-ID: <AA8E3CBBF6E2E7489931D9F30A7BDBD81B23EB@zajnbnt006.za.deloitte.com>

Hi,

I have been doing some work on cookie analysis, and thought I'd share what
I've done with the group.

It is quite rough and ready at this point, but seems to be quite effective.

Essentially, the method is:

Collect a sample of cookies, by replaying a request however many times is
desired. (The request can be taken from an Exodus proxy session, or simply a
handcrafted request to the URL that generates the cookies)

I typically do something like:

for i in `seq 1 10000` ; do
  cat cookierequest | nc server port | egrep "^Date|Set-Cookie" >> sample
done

cat sample | ./processcookie.pl > baked

(process cookie converts the date and time from the response to seconds from
epoch, and outputs lines like:

seconds:cookiename:cookievalue

Which can then be grepped for a specific cookie if the app generates more
than one)

I then convert the cookie value to a number (typically a BIIIG number :-)
using a Perl script that I have written.

cat baked | grep cookiename | ./charset.pl > values.dat

Charset.pl basically looks at the characters that are in use for each
position in the cookie, and uses that positional character set to convert
the character to a number. E.g. the character "C" in a set "ABC" is
equivalent to the number 2 in a base 3 system. The overall cookie value is
calculated by the formula 

The nice thing about this method is that, even if the character set is, say,
+-0-9A-Za-z (64 chars), if half of them are never used for whatever reason,
they don't contribute to making the numbers larger than they need to be.

$value += index($c[$n],$charset[$n]) * (length($charset[$n]) ** ($l - $n -
1) )

Where $n is the character position in the cookie, and $l is the length of
the cookie

I then take the output (values.dat), and plot it using gnuplot. Depending on
the sample size, it is quite likely that you will see any patterns in the
cookies, such as different sequences operating in parallel (e.g. the web
server is talking to multiple instances of an application server in a
round-robin/load-balanced schema)

You can then filter your cookie sample (looking for repeated characters,
etc) to focus on a particular sequence, and graph that individually to see
the pattern in more detail. (charset.pl can also help here, as it can print
out the character set for each position in the cookie. The smaller the
character set for that position, the more likely it is that there is a
pattern there)

Finally, you can use strange.pl to look for "strange attractors" (See Michal
Zalewski's work on TCP sequence number predictability), and plot that on a
3d or 2d graph.




Sample data, obfuscated to protect the innocent :-)

Raw cookie dump

Processed cookie output
=======================
1047470863:eBvm:9
1047470863:o_ebId:Rlqv0QtA30Q16cKKx1Rg

1047470868:eBvm:9
1047470868:o_ebId:wN3AcgcxCLg6Qvool6wv

As you can see, there are repeated strings in this sample "g6Qvo", "XJySQ".
Picking one sequence to focus on, we get:

Cookies for XJySQ

Which we can split into two parts, before and after the static string, and
analyse separately.

Dave

All looks good. I think its worth explaining the thought was to
serialize testing each month on the new portal. The new portal really is
cool. A rolling demo can often be found at http://12.237.96.109 and it
will move to the owasp dev servers soon. In case thats down heres a
screen shot.

I also wanted to just point out that any work that is submitted for
consideration you are agreeing that it will be copyrighted to the Free
Software Foundation and released under GNU licensing. I know 99% of
everyones fine with that, but there are a few people playing silly
buggers. The layers advise us that as long as we have let everyone know
and given them a chance to object thats all we need to do. So if you
object, please let Dave and I know and well remove your contribution. 

Cheers

Hi all,

I really want to adhere to the schedule set forth for release, so would
appreciate your feedback ASAP.  Please share your comments/sugguestions with
the rest of the list by this weekend so I can develop a decent merging and
editing of the document to go out by April 1.  Even if it's a small comment!
Still looking for an updated graphic and more concrete regulatory examples.

I've added a few people to our list who have kindly agreed to volunteer some
time with the peer review process. If it's your first posting, feel free to
introduce yourself. THANKS,

Hi Dave et all.

I will spend some time on this tonight and as suggested by Dave, I will
introduce myself.

My name is Steve Manzuik, I am one of the moderators of VulnWatch a
vulnerability disclosure mailing list (www.vulnwatch.org), a former
member of Nomad Mobile Research Center (NMRC), and currently an
independent consultant in Calgary, Alberta (www.entrenchtech.com).  I
hope I can be a bit of help on the OWASP project and I am glad to be
here.  You can get me off this list at steve at entrenchtech.com or
steve at vulnwatch.org.

Cheers;

Steve Manzuik

Sorry David, but isn't this version of the Testing Guide trimmed down? 
This copy (the rtf file in the zip file) is only 15 pages long and ends 
with the "Phase 3 - Reporting" epigraph of "The OWASP Test Phases".

Maybe the copy lost content when converting from docbook to rtf. 
Wouldn't it make more sense to produce a pdf version for peer review?

Best regards

Hi Javier,

We're only working on the initial sections first so as to focus our energies
appropriately and to serialize the sections on the new OWASP portal.

If you'd like to see the mostly rough unfinished document, I've uploaded it
in both OpenOffice and rtf formats to
http://www.owasp.org/testing/testing.zip .  As you can see from the amount
left to be done, you'll probably agree a monthly staggered approach to
release is the best way to go.

FYI, when you all start to share comments/edits, for now I think the best
way is to do it in plain text and email them to the entire list.  Cut and
paste where necessary.

Message-ID: <3E81D201.1090702@germinus.com>

I have reviewed the first release David made on the OWASP Testing 
methodology. I'm adding some comments below on issues which might or 
might not be relevant to the document.

Hopefully the comments will be useful to the people who have written the 
document.

Best Regards

Javier Fernandez-Sanguino
Security Divison

------------------------------- Start Comments ----------------------

[1] page 4
People have probably spotted this, but, anyway, the table of contents 
includes a full paragraph between the page references. Probably a 
problem with the styles:

"Unicode	54
A Tester should ensure in the source code that some security checking 
should is carried out after UTF-8 decoding is completed. "

[2] page 6
The following line:
"There are many different publicly available checklists one can download 
on how to securely deploy specific web technologies (erg. Apache, IIS, 
iPlanet, etc.), "
could probably be changed to:
"There are many different publicly available checklists one can download 
on how to securely deploy specific web technologies (erg. installing 
Apache, IIS or iPlanet, developing in Java, VisualBasic or PHP, etc.), "

Otherwise the example is too specific, IMHO, to checklists related to 
vendor (web server) products and undermines the phrase.

[3] page 8

I do not agree completely with this statement:

"(...) was started in September of 2001. At the time there was no 
central place where developers and security professionals could learn 
how to build secure web applications or test the security of their 
products. (...)"

Related to secure web applications the World Wide Web Consortium has had 
http://www.w3.org/Security/ for quite some time. Also the WWW Security 
FAQ has been provided since 1995. As for security testing, the OSSTMM 
first version, for example, was published in april 2001 and had a (very 
small) section on web application testing. Granted, OWASP has 
spearheaded the web security effort since then and now produces far 
better information that those sources.

Maybe the paragraph should be changed to

"(...) was started in September of 2001. At the time the information 
available for developers and security professionals where they could 
learn how to build secure web applications or test the security of their 
products was fairly insufficient. Although documentation such as the WWW 
Consortium's "WWW Security FAQ" and the OSTMM from (at that time) 
Ideahamster organisation were a start, they did not provide sufficient 
in depth information for professionals and, in some cases, had been 
obsoleted by new emerging technologies. (...)"

[4] page 10

"The Application Tier may include technology like CGI's, Java, .NET 
services, PHP or ColdFusion "

I would not include CGI as a technology since it is, essentially, a 
specification, as described at http://www.w3.org/CGI/. CGI has, IMHO, 
been (wrongly) used as a reference to scripts that implemented (at the 
time) the specification, i.e. shell/perl/C scripts. The CGI interface is 
used, however, by .NET services, PHP aplications, ASPs...

I would rephrase that as:
"The Application Tier may include the use of specifications such as CGI 
or SOAP and technologies like interpreted scripts, Java applications, 
.NET services, PHP or ColdFusion."

[5] page 11

"Of course small applications may consist of a simple CGI running on a 
local host; reading or writing files to disk. "

Again a bad use of the CGI term IMHO. Why not rephrase it to:

"Of course small applications may consist of a simple script running on 
a local host; communicating through CGI with the web server and reading 
or writing files to disk. "

[6] page 13

Related to the regulatory requirements:

"Financial institutions have regulatory requirements from the FDIC or 
OCC for Internet banking , see for example the very general and vague (...)"

should be changed to:

"At the US, financial institutions have regulatory requirements from the 
FDIC or OCC for Internet banking , see for example the very general and 
vague ...."

I believe it would also be relevant to add a note on the European 
Directive 95/46/EC: "on the protection of individuals with regard to the 
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data"
http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/privacy/index_en.htm

Which states:

"Article 17
Security of processing
1. Member States shall provide that the controller must implement 
appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal 
data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, 
alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the 
processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against 
all other unlawful forms of processing."

This directive has been converted into a law in all European countries. 
Meaning that companies which use personal data as part of an e-commerce 
service might be legally liable if anything of the above occurs. This is 
pretty similar to the HIPAA and very relevant to web applications which 
usually make use of databases including personal information which 
should be protected from attack.

[7] page 15

I think that a note on what is currently done in web application 
security might be useful here to drive a point. As you all are aware 
security testing in web deployments are currently primarily based on 
"penetration tests" (a.k.a. security black box analysis) of the web 
services deployed.

This is usually flashy ("I was able to retrieve you whole customer 
database from the Internet") but it's far from sufficient if you want to 
make sure that applications are secure and will stay that way (i.e. 
application developers will not make the same mistakes again, web 
services will be deployed following security guidelines). Maybe a 
footnote on this could be added to the following paragraph or before in 
the text when describing the different security testing phases:

"Implementation Review and Testing -  An implementation review involves 
actual testing of the security of the application as implemented (often 
called grey or black box testing)."


[8]

Overall I think this section gives a good introduction on what web 
services are and what the current needs are. However, I would like it to 
link or reference information from third parties. It is very 
OWASP-specific and seems to say "before us, nothing was done on the web 
security area".

It would be proper, IMHO, to talk slightly more about previous works and 
to current works which might be related to the OWASP effort.

Some samples:

- The yet to be released OSSTMM version 3 includes much more information 
on web application testing guidelines and tools (version 2.0 provides 
already much more than 1.0)

- NIST has produced some outstanding documents on overall security, 
security testing (maybe too network specific) and web applications too. 
Take a look at NIST SP-800-44: 
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-44/sp800-44.pdf
(it might be too specific to the products and OS itself, not the 
applications, but it's part of what OWASP testing is about)

- SANS is trying to produce a web application check list
http://www.sans.org/score/webappschecklist.php as part of the SCORE project.

- IntersectAlliance has produced some high-quality (IMHO) security 
checklists for web-related applications: 
http://www.intersectalliance.com/projects/

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Uncle OWASP needs YOU!
Message-ID: <EB005E067BC00A458EF6639DEC5AEDA3B4F64A@df-muttley.dogfood>

Here is my feedback on the first section.

1. Page 10 says, "The functions performed can range form relatively simple tasks like..."  "Form" should be "from".

2. Page 11 - Can we get a better resolution graphic?  I can barely make out the text.

3. Page 11 - It looks like ASP is in the presentation tier of the graphic.  I think this should be in the application tier.  Entire web apps have been written in ASP.  According to your definition for the application tier it fits there.  ASP handles the user input, making decisions, and obtaining more data.  PHP is in the application tier; ASP and PHP are very similar.  I don't know much about Java server pages, but perhaps they also belong in the application tier.

4. Page 11 - We should add a non-browser application to the leftmost list in the presentation tier.  Something like FrontPage or Word.  Most people realize the web browser uses the web, but they may not realize their desktop office productivity application do too.

5. Page 12 - "A Data Tier is used to store things needed by the application and acts as a repository for both temporary and permanent data. It is the bank vault or database of a web application. Modern systems are typically now storing data in XML format for interoperability with other system and sources.
Of course small applications may consist of a simple CGI running on a local host; reading or writing files to disk."  
This makes it sound like a database, local files, and XML are separate things.  The XML format is used in both files and databases.  Perhaps the wording should be, "A Data Tier is used to read and store things needed by the application and acts as a repository for both temporary and permanent data. This data can be read and stored in local files or a database.  Modern systems are typically now formatting the data as XML for interoperability with other system and sources."

6. Page 13 - "The most effective way to strengthen the security of a web application is to include security testing as an integral part of the development lifecycle."  I think this statement is a little overboard.  While security testing is extremely important, I would argue that secure design and coding practices are just as important if not more.  Security should be thought of in all stages of the product cycle, but security testing does happen until you have designed and coded something.  During the design phase threat modeling is pretty important; secure coding practices and security awareness is important during implementation.  These are not usually referred to as testing.  Let's change this to "An important way to strengthen..." or "One effective way to strengthen..."?

7. Page 14 - Should we include something about P3P since we are talking about policies and P3P is a web related policy?

Hi all,

I really want to adhere to the schedule set forth for release, so would
appreciate your feedback ASAP.  Please share your comments/sugguestions with
the rest of the list by this weekend so I can develop a decent merging and
editing of the document to go out by April 1.  Even if it's a small comment!
Still looking for an updated graphic and more concrete regulatory examples.

I've added a few people to our list who have kindly agreed to volunteer some
time with the peer review process. If it's your first posting, feel free to
introduce yourself. THANKS,

Sorry dave, was flirting between airports

Tom and Javier did cover quiet a bit of what i was going to say (it pays to be quick)

Page 11:

i also agreee with Tom in that Java server pages belonging in the application tier

Page 13:

In addition to the European directive, the UK has the Data Protection Act, which applies to all personal information stored in files or databases. 
Maybe a section defining all the different laws applying to this section needs to be added?


Other than that, it looks great.
ill have another final look when i'm totallly awake

I think everyone's on the same page but just so we are clear jsp's are
compiled the first time they are called into effectively regular
servlets. The old model pre jdk1.2 was more like asp and php.

With this and asp.net and code behind things are a little more blurry
but I guess the original point was to  discuss why mixing presentation
and business logic is not a good idea for security (web server gets
rooted, loose applications as well).

The new owasp guide (draft) has a good new section on this and
architectures that its worth syncing up with. You can check it out of
cvs.

From randolph at seawa.org.au  Sat Mar 29 22:29:18 2003

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] nag nag nag - comments please
Message-ID: <2A7BEE31ED0FFF40AE0C4E68A53AB2650B2666@ntserver.seawa.org.au>

A number of comments on the intro section...

1.	Following the discussion on where ASP, and JSP fit, I think that it is important to identify where the technologies were supposed to be used, rather than where they are being used.  Both ASP and JSP (and for that matter PHP) were designed as presentation layer technologies.  ASP was designed to work with COM components to do the application tier logic, JSP was designed to work with Java classes (aka Java Beans) and initially PHP wasn't designed to do any back end processing.  Before I get shot down for this comment, a lot has changed since then and these languages have advanced considerably, so perhaps they do belong in the Application tier.  My preference is to see ASP and JSP in the presentation tier and their associated technologies ie COM/COM+/Serviced Components and Java beans, in the application tier

2.	Section "What are Web Applications"
	
	Replace "developed at the Speed of Light" with "evolved at a staggering rate" - Speed of Light is a bit to SciFi for a professional document
	
	Replace "Java (or Similar Language)" with "an object-oriented language" - More generalist

	Replace "Through Complex Business logic tiers" with "Using complex business logic" - Use of tier is unnecessary


3.	Rearrangement of paragraphs - The "What are Web Services" section should be before the paragraph starting "It can help to think of a web application....".  A new section heading should be inserted after this section titled "3-Tiers of logic" or something similar.  Web Services really only differ from web applications in the presentation tier, instead of displaying data via a web browser they pass data via a remote method call.  Instead of being viewed by a human user (ie web application), web services are consumed by other applications/services.

	To this end, I would also reword the paragraph "It can help to think of a web application being made up of three logical tiers or functions" to "Most modern applcations can be divided into three logical tiers or functions".  The three tier separation is becoming more common in even desktop applications where the GUI is separated from the functional classes, which is separate from the data/persistence layer.

4.	Section "Presentation Tier"

	Replace "Presentation Tiers are responsible" with The presentation tier is responsible"

	Replace "It may also include application compoenets that create the page layout" with It may also include components that determine the presentation logic and create the page layout.

5.	Section "Data tier"

	Should be renamed "Persistence Tier" - The other two layers talk about "Presentation" (The way things are presented) and "Application" (The logic that brings the data together).  Following this format the word "Persisence" (The way data is stored) is more consistent than data (what is being stored).

6.	Section "Application Security Development Lifecycle"

	Ammend "Those tasks ... development and testing" to "Those tasks ... development, testing, deployment, maintenance and retirement" - The deployment and maintenance areas are especially important as it is these areas that security is of upmost importance as there is real data involved.  The omission of the last three sections in a lifecycle is one of the most common and unforgivable mistakes that any software engineer can make!!


Anyway, there is enough ramblings from me.  They are just my thoughts, so take what you want from it.

Cheers

Nick

Hiya Nick, 

This was my thinking. Putting ASP and JSP in the same bag would be like
saying Win32 and MVS are both OS's. Whilst true, one is a monolithic
kernel and one isn't. I think we are at (or need to be) a layer deeper
in the descriptions. You can pre-compile a JSP before you deploy it, you
cant do that with ASP (unless I am very much mistaken). They are
different beasts with similar names. Mentioning the origins is great and
will obviously help. I guess my point is I think we need to talk the
lingua de franca of developers and if you speak to a Java developer and
say jsp is the same as ASP you would get a shrug....see my point ;-) A
JSP is a servlet is a servlet. Now that said JSP can and does clearly
deal with presentation so maybe the whole presentation , business logic
and data tier thing is whats wrong. We perhaps need to articulate that
some technologies so both. Then again I think thats the job of the Guide
and not testing, i guess there are a a whole new class of issues in
testing code that contains references to DSN's than there is a method
call ;-)

This is important to get right as it is fundamental to the Guide and
Testing.

I am attaching the first wo chapters to the new Guide which I spruced up
a bit. I think they help with some of the other comments here and
elsewhere. There is a lot of great stuff of architecture and the common
problems. Well worth a cvs download !


PS I have been rebuilding machines so haven't read the Testing chapters
yet. I will tonight.

Message-ID: <BAAD043A.42D0%jpoteet@tech-partners.com>

Some good comments so far.  I have a few thoughts that I wanted to share.
Take from this what you want.

1) I know we can't and don't want to attempt to list every technology that
can be used in web development.  However a category or type of technology
that seems to be missing in the diagram and text is the use of rich web
interfaces such as Java applets or ActiveX controls.  I'm not sure if that
is an oversight or an intended omission.

2) Most of the notes I started making and the comments to the list seem to
revolve around the use of technologies and where they fit in the
architecture of a web application.  I think we need to be careful not to
fall into a "can't see the forest for the trees" issue.  I'm not sure what
the full scope of where we are going to take web application security
testing, but it seems like that should dictate the depth of understanding of
web application architecture that is required.  For example, if we are going
to focus on "black box" or pen testing or looking at the application from an
attacker's perspective, the only tier of the application that is required
for us to understand would be the presentation tier.  The remaining tiers
would actually become a potential target for the test, i.e. can we determine
how the rest of the application is architected and does that expose other
vulnerabilities.

On the other hand, if we are going to "expand" the scope of testing to
include code reviews, testing of components such as EJBs or COM for which we
need to create a test harness, etc., we obviously have to understand the
architecture more fully.  These types of tests sometimes can only be done by
the developers of the application.  For example, some of our customers only
have us conduct "black box" assessments, while others give us full access to
the source code, environment, etc.  I'm sure the rest of you would have
similar stories.

In short (realizing I passed that point 2 paragraphs ago), I feel that we
should focus on those things necessary to establish, implement and evaluate
the testing process and leave anything extraneous to that for other groups
to handle.  If we need to show the architecture of the web application in a
similar fashion to what we are now doing, we must keep in sync with what
other OWASP projects, such as the Guide are doing.  I think Mark mentioned
this in his comments, and this will be an ongoing struggle for the OWASP
leadership, but minimizing the instances where OWASP documents may be in
conflict will be something we will have to stay focused on as each project
matures.

3) In the five common reasons to test a web application, what I feel is
often the main reason is either missing or doesn't jump out to me.  It seems
like the main reason we test is to try to locate our security
vulnerabilities, whether they are design or implementation problems, before
an attacker exploits them.  Our applications are constantly being "tested"
by attackers.  That could possibly fit into one of the reasons listed, and
while it may seem pretty basic, I think it's important to come out and say
something about it.

Again, those are my initial thoughts.  I'm really looking forward to how
this document fleshes out over the next year.

Agree. I think what is being suggested about ensuring we keep in sync
makes a lot of sense and ensuring testing focuses on testing also seems
smart. 

Overall I think the aim wasn't to prescribe testing as black box or
white box or whatever, it was more to describe each discipline that you
might consider, highlight the pros and cons of each, describe when each
may be appropriate, and describe a process and technique proceedures to
undertake each and them. 

Does that seem sensible and accurate? 

Given its much easier to bite off small chunks at a time I would suggest
we focus on those first four chapters for now. This is what I think the
intent of them was.

Chapter 1 - Introduction - obvious. Use the Guide format. 
Chapter 2 - What is a Web Application or Web Service ? - set the scene
and make the book complete for someone who is reading it in isolation or
needs the chapter for context. Refer to the OWASP Guide as the
definitive reference. Pull content directly from the Guide.

So that leaves US with the first two REAL chapters for this project of
Why Test and The OWASP Testing Methodology. I think 3 is relatively easy
and 4 will see hot debate ;-) And rightly so.

Chapter 3 - Why Test ? - Objective: discuss the reasons why you would
want to test. Jeremy's point is well taken, there maybe more. Perhaps
create a Chapter 3 document on its own and start iterating improvements
? Dave, are you the keeper for any updates ? If we can put it into
DocBook chapter by Chapter and in CVS it will be a whole lot easier. I
know I go from DocBook hater to lover but it really is working well for
the Guide project now ;-)

Chapter 4 - Objective to define a structured methodology that could be
adopted for how to decide, Why, When, What and How to test your target
site / applications. Now I have written that I have convinced myself
Chapter 3 is a sub section of Chapter 4. What struck me when I re-read
the heading and subheadings was we kinda prescribed a right way and a
wrong way. I think thats the Phase word that indicates serialization. I
think its more a case of here are the things you should consider and
heres some tips that can help you arrive about your answer. Thats not to
say some things aren't logically before others. Clearly a plan is a good
idea and theres no point in creating  that afterwards right.

Anyways Dave, what do you day about chapter by chapter. I am sure we can
all knock out the Methodology in a few weeks of online debate ?

PS The portal architect is off this week coding it up. It really is
close but is a lot of week. It will get pounded and were damn determined
its going to be as secure as it can be. As you know we spoke about this
being serialize chapter by Chapter month by month for the rest of the
year. Thats still the best thing to do but I would hate for this to
start on the crappy html site we have today. I will chat to David
Raphael and see if we can do the xslt for the first 3 chapters if you
agree 1 is Intro, 2 is what are web apps and 3 is methodology. When
thats agreed I'll personally do the CVS docbook entries.

From rhoades at mavensecurity.com  Mon Mar 31 13:05:02 2003
From: rhoades at mavensecurity.com (David Rhoades)
Date: Mon, 31 Mar 2003 13:05:02 -0500
Subject: comments / feedback on draft Intro section RE: [OWASP-TESTING] nag nag nag - comments please
Message-ID: <002301c2f7b0$1f106c70$737ba8c0@DFR>

Some comments on the intro section (some may be repeats of others - sorry).

Where practical I have put underscores to show where changes have been made.

Page 8: Preface, paragraph 1
Word change: To this day, not one web application technology has shown
itself _immune_ to the inevitable discovery of vulnerabilities that affect
its owners' and users' security and privacy.

Also maybe: To this day, _no_ web application technology...


Page 8: Preface, paragraph 3
Missing comma: ...industry derived and proven standard_,_ to system
owners... 


Page 9: About OWASP, paragraph 1
Missing word?: At the same time the commercial marketplace for web
application _security_ started to evolve. 

Word change: ...really only _addressed_ a small portion...

Word change: ...really left _customers_ with a false sense of security.


Page 9: Using this Document, paragraph 1
Singular needs plural: ...TO SECURITY TESTING OF WEB APPLICATION_S_.

Page 9: About the Authors
Reword (removed "and"; added commas): ...for their time, knowledge, and
dedication.

Page 11: Intro - What are web apps
Run on sentences - broke in half: ...INVENTORY MANAGEMENT ACROSS MULTIPLE
VENDORS. FUNCTIONS CAN INCLUDE BOTH BUSINESS TO BUSINESS OR BUSINESS TO
CONSUMER E-COMMERCE, WORK FLOW, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND LEGACY
APPLICATIONS. 

Removed "A": ...OFTEN CONNECTING TO SIMPLE DATABASES...


Page 12: Presentation Tier
Defined acronym; added comma: THE PRESENTATION TIER INCLUDES WEB SERVERS
LIKE APACHE AND INTERNET INFORMATION SERVER _(IIS)_, AND WEB BROWSERS...


Page 13: Data Tier:
Made plural: ...INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER SYSTEM_S_ AND SOURCES.


Page 13: What are Web Services
General comment: Perhaps include an example of how a Web Service can act
like a client and/or server at any given time.  The Web Service acts like a
server to the end user (i.e. the web browser), but that same Web Service can
act like a client when it requests a service or data from another Web
Service.


Page 14: Application Security Lifecycle
Word choice: ...THAT IS TO SAY THAT TIME _DICTATES_ WHEN SPECIFIC TASKS
SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN. 

Isolate sentence fragment with commas: ...AT ALL STAGES OF AN APPLICATION'S
DEVELOPMENT, FROM REQUIREMENTS GATHERING TO CODING AND DEPLOYMENT, TO ENSURE
THAT...

Page 15: last sentence of "Application Security Lifecycle"
removed comma: ...SECURITY SPECIFIED OR INTENDED IS THAT WHICH IS REALIZED.


Page 15: Industry Best Practice
Add comma to last item in list: ...focus on operating systems, network
infrastructure, and information security management. 


Page 15: Operational Security Lifecycle
remove comma: How does a change in component X affect component Y? 

needed rewording: Security is as good as the weakest link..
Here's my attempt: Security is as good as the weakest link, and therefore
makes logical sense to include security testing of web applications as part
of operational readiness checks. 

needed rewording: Testing should be carried out...
Here's my attempt: Testing should be carried out on a periodic basis, and
when changes occur to the application or its deployment environment.


Page 15: Internal Standard/Policy
made policy plural; added commas to separate list of items: ...defines
policies, standards, and procedures for...

[2nd sentence] slight reword: These policies, standards, and procedures...

Comment: Should "policy" be "policies"?  I don't know if it matters.  I
thought it sounded better plural, but now I'm having doubts.  We need a tech
editor for this :-)


Page 15: Regulatory Requirements

reword needed: Some countries have passed laws that _require_ certain
industries to take _specific_ security provisions.
[Word "certain" was repeated twice in same sentence, and "which" was used
incorrectly.]

added "the": ...applications called _the_ Cardholder Information Security
Program


Page 16: last sentence for Intro section:

reword: Although none of the above are specifically related to web
applications, regulations and guidelines of this nature are likely to
address web apps in the short term.
