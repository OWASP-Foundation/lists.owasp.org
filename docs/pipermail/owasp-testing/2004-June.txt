I think that would be great. Last I recall (and I may not be correct) Larry was going to finish editing what we have and I was then going to complete the missing sections before we submit to the pro tech editor. It would be great if we could do it before the conference.

Hey all,

Sorry for the silent period, but work and various security conferences 
kinda caught up with me.

With the first phase about to be released, we need to start 
concentrating on the second phase and what will be covered and what 
won't.

So where do we go from here?

Attached is a _very_ rough outline of the different sections i feel 
should be included within this second phase. Now this isn't the final 
structure and I'm hoping we can all have a good debate on what should 
be added within this section.

Take a look at the outline, start the conversation going on this list 
(new people, can you subscribe to the list over at 
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-testing ) , and lets 
get a framework up and running so i can start asking people which 
section they would like to write/contribute to.

I'll be at the OWASP conference in New York next weekend for a few 
short hours, so feel free to come and chat if you are there

Looking forward to seeing this section grow

Cheers

Daniel

Hiya,

I'd suggest separation out Authentication, Authorisation (Access Control)
and Session Management into different sections rather than grouping them
together.  They are inter-dependant, but are distinct.

Plus, there is already a fairly lengthy (black-box) Session Management
testing section that we put together at the tail end of last year (which
I'll send you off-list coz it's a fat word document).

Glyn.

Glyn's paper was fantastic (lets not tell him, his head is big enough as it is :p ), but
your right, it will be included
as i havent seen anything else out there since which would make me think otherwise.

I have a little suggestion about part 1 and part 2, since part 1 defines the how, when, where and why, I think it's more like an "executive" document.  Perhaps we can separate this two documents by calling them executive and technical or something like that (I don't like this terms, but this is the idea) instead of part 1 and part 2.

Just my two cents

Cheers
JC

Message-ID: <E1BY4Ma-00044n-U8@sc8-sf-mx2.sourceforge.net>

It's about time it had a quick update, including all the feedback we have got from the
public (Jeff, any news on the
testing at owasp.org forward?)

I've updated it to reflect version one being released before the conference next weekend,
not sure if this is still the
case, but fingers crossed.
Could everyone who has time give it a good look over and send comments back?

The next section i want to work on is the flow diagram as it looks kinda bland and crap
and i'm sure a cleaner version
can be done

Danke,

Daniel

Also are you on the owasp-testing at lists.sourceforge.net list?

Anyone else have feedback/comments? (dont be scared..haha ill even buy beers at the OWASP

testing at owasp.org is created, but I can't find an easy way to get it
forwarding to owasp-testing at lists.sourceforge.net.  This should be resolved
when we get all the mailing lists running at the OWASP Foundation.  Stay
tuned.

Morning,Afternoon,Evening,

Since we have a load of new subscribers to the list for the second phase, i'd like to
welcome them all.
Has everyone got a copy of the draft outline i sent out last week so we can start deciding
on the sections we will focus on?

I'll be in NY from tomorrow evening so mail responses may be a bit slow.

Cheers

I sent the list some comments (and an updated diagram) in the mail 
with Message-ID: <407AF9AF.9060609 at germinus.com> (answering to Juan 
Carlos Calderon's concerns). Did you receive it? There a number of 
inconsistencies in the diagram which should be fixed.

If you like, I can resend my proposal for the flow diagram as well as 
the explanation for the changes.

Regards

Javier

Correct. The arrow from "Try and exploit" to "Did you succeed" should
not have a "YES" on it

Correct again.

> 3. "Is there information leakage?" has 2 "YES" flow arrows.

Correct. The "YES" should point to the "Is the type of information
business critical" and the "No" of "Is the type of information
business cricital" should point to "Go through each testing...."

>  4. "Is the type of information business critical?" has no "NO"

See above.

> 5. "Have all possible test being executed?" it is not

Correct.

Also notice that there should be an arrow after "Contact the business
organization". All the steps after the "YES" to "Attack succeded"
should go back to the same phases since the main idea as the "NO" (in
order for the cycle to be repeated)

I've been thinking about the flowchart a little bit. And attached is
my proposal for it. I think it's easier to understand this way. I'm
sorry it's not put in a "prettier form" (but I've done my best to
re-route all connections)

Message-ID: <E1BZmiW-0003d5-5M@sc8-sf-mx2.sourceforge.net>

Hey all,

As some of you may have noticed, my visio skills leave loads to be desired.
With the flow diagram for the pen test checklist, does anyone know how to make it look
easier on the eye?

Ideally i'd like to have the flow diagram looking as nice as possible and not the standard
boring look and feel.
Is this possible, or is the creative side to me useless when it comes to flow diagrams?

Cheers

There are many ways to represent the diagrams. I suggest we stick to UML
sequence diagrams, state diagrams, activity diagrams and use cases as they
are well known and understood. 

How many people are away of Tufte's work? In particular, Envisioning
Information and the equally brilliant "Visual Explanations: Images and
Quantities, Evidence and Narrative"? In fact, all of his three major works
are worth the read and are beautiful objets d'art in their own right.

http://www.edwardtufte.com

See the image (which is one diagram from Envisioning Information) for an
"out of the box" idea.

Here goes another suggestion

Do not mix "pure" web application issues with web application infrastructure issues, this is do not mix SQL injection which is a purerly programming (bad) practice with Web Server configuration issues like "HTTP Server banner". I've always fight for this disctintion to be made.

In my oppinion it is very important to separate OS, HTTP Server, application server (like a servlet engine) and application itself, they are different things and different ways to test them. For example, you hardly will perform a source review on a HTTP Server and only an automated blackbox testing for the "web software"* (very innacurate), but, blackbox tools are very good for http server issues (exploits) and source review for web application.

*Web Software = the web application itself, e.g. a portal made of some php pages (liked this term from Mark)

What do you think people?

Hey all,

Sorry for the silent period, but work and various security conferences

With the first phase about to be released, we need to start

So where do we go from here?

Attached is a _very_ rough outline of the different sections i feel

Hi Juan Carlos and the list, 

IMHO, configuration management at application and infraestructura criteria
impacts in a well done application. You can develop a very good application
but you must have it in a correct enviroment. For example, an incorrect
application server configuration, like the posibility of execute servelts by
class instead of mapping it in web.xml could allow execute admin or util
servelts, incorrect logging could bring protection law penalties, etc. in
other hand and not less important, technical infraestructure disclosure its
not a good pratice at all. All this questions have to be test in the
process.

In the guideline of the document these parts are separated but integrate in
the process of testing. The items are general (a web server banner is always
the same for every manufacturer. Sometimes in the testing process you must
adapt the checklist to the minor casualties of your auditing target, like
OS, web server manufacturer, that as you said automated tools identify them
very good, but not if the log its not activated so you have to review it by
hand. 

In this way, and taking your good suggestion we can group the different
issues into the configuration chapters by the part of the infraestructure
that could impact (Web Server, Application server, .. etc) and always
separating of the manufacturer or technology.

Best Regards,

Pablo

I totally agree Pablo

I was not proposing to exclude infrastructure issues, but to separate them as you also mention at the end of your message.

In fact I realized they are separated in the outline, just that I got confused with the token transport security issue

Subject: Layers of Web Application Security - was: RE: [OWASP-TESTING] OWASP Testing Guide Phase Two
In-Reply-To: <999169B0CC0F2A418615C28851C5C07104C5FF14@CINMLVEM09.e2k.ad.ge.com>
Message-ID: <NFBBKPKOGFFDMNDKHGOAIEOLHFAA.ts@securenet.de>

Juan Carlos, you mentioned the right point. But we go even further in
separating the different aspects of Application Security. Although it
doesn't seem possible to give a clean layered structure where each topic of
Application Security naturally falls into, the following approach has shown
to be helpful.


Layer        Comment, Example
5 - Semantic
    Social Engineering, Phishing, Identity Theft,
    Deception, Forgery, Fraud, Privacy

4 - Application Logic
    Workflow/Controlflow, mapping of Use-Cases.
    Expl: Is the "Password forgotten" function logically
    secure implemented?

3 - Implementation
    Programming Errors in the (custom) web app that
    lead to vulnerabilities like SQL Injection etc.

2 - Technology
    Choice of appropriate means (Expl.: use of hashing
    for tokens)
    Correct use of means (Expl. Hash must have an appropriate
    randomness)

1 - System Software
    Webserver, Application Server, Database,
    other Systems and Services as long as they are part
    of the application as a whole
    The area of "Known Vulnerabilities"

0 - Network and Host
    Ports, Firewall Rules, Internet Services,
    OS Hardening

Environmental "Layers":

X - Processes and Organization
    Application Security in Software Development Process,
    Enterprise Security Concepts, etc.
    Coding Guidelines

Y - Specific Requirements
    Inhouse, legal, third parties requirements
    Data protection and privay,
    KonTraG/Basel II, HIPAA,...

Notes:
- Layer 2 'Technology' does not really fit into the model of layers, but
nevertheless I think it's ok.
- Layer 0 may be seen as part of Application Security or not. We tend to not
include it and put the interface to the network/host security people above
it. In some cases (perhaps generally?) layer 1 falls out of Application
Security as well.

With this model you can explain for example the use of tools for
pentesting/auditing web applications relative clearly.

Layer 0:
  that's where security scanners like nessus work best
Layer 1:
  network scanners still perform well
  commercial web application scanners like AppScan work best
  human testers perform to some degree
Layer 3:
  already above the capabilities of nessus-like tools
  AppScan-like application scanners are useful tools here
  human expert is absolutely necessary
  Code Reading is appropriate
Layer 4 and 5:
  human expert only, automatic testing not possible


Any comments/improvements to this layer model?

I agree too.  A lot of the infrastructure related issues fall into the
'presentation tier' category, such as old/unnecessary files and server
components left in place, or platform vulnerabilities.  

Whilst these are equally important, the practicalities of testing and
division of responsibilities may mean that these are out of scope or control
of the app tester.

There are a number of crossover areas - e.g. the SQL injection example is an
application flaw, but if the user the application access the database with
is overly privileged, this is arguably a presentation (or data) tier issue.

Yes that's noticeable, I still think though that the original document 
had a more methodology feeling to it though by no means anything finished.

You have no idea how many requests I have received for Endlers original 
document, it was released as a methodology. The two testing documents 
that you currently are working on bears no such title nor objective if I 
have understood it correctly.

It's difficult to do a methodology, but I think it would be fruitful to 
begin such a document after we have the two testing documents in house.

Part 1 is still kind of confuse I think, what is its objective? I see it 
as an introduction to testing web applications but it doesn't say much.

Part 2 on the other hand I understand will be what to test for and how.

In my opinion, only when these two documents are finished, a methodology 
  can be established.

Mads

The preview I sent you was just a preview so i don?t think its valuable to discuss it on this list when it hasn?t been made available to others and they can't contribute.

What I can say is the intention of Part 1 is to shed light on the scope of testing, techniques that can be applied and dispel some myths about shiny red buttons. As an example we know from research and experience that testing the design can be more valuable and cost effective than testing a deployed application. 

Your right that is is really hard to develop a methodology on one hand. I think that is because unlike say an OS when you can define ..."check the permission on file x to ensure they are XXRW" applications are generally bespoke, organic and complex beasts. What we have tried to do in Part 1 is define the processes, techniques and tools that can help in building a testing program for your software. This is more of a testing strategy.

In Part 2 we then will get down to the specifics of how to test for issues using those techniques (code review, pen testing etc). What we didn?t want to do (which is where Davids doc started heading) was to create a black-box orientated script of things that should be included as its clearly a tactical way to test and pen testing is rarely the most effective (cost, time, efficient) way to test for issues in web apps. 

We are calling the whole thing a framework as clearly different things will work for different people and this is a framework from which people can build there own testing methodology from. I think when you look at 1 and 2 combined you will have the information to do that and 1 alone will help people understand how to look at building a testing framework for themselves. It is certainly not a pen test methodology which I can see could be of value to some people. I think we could very easily repurpose the pen test content that is being developed for Part 2 into a stand-alone pen test methodology if there is a need and interest. 

Maybe Glyn can send his excellent example of what that will look like for Part 2 - Analyzing Session Tokens as a sample?

Agreed, that's my experience aswell, though it's not an easy task.

Sure although I think the OWASP guides shouldn't go into OS specific 
stuff aswell as network and firewall rules.
I think we could refer to the OSSTM project for that and focus just on 
application testing.

I don't think we're there yet but I see your point.

I think more information should be included on tools, I don't know how 
you feel about including information on comercial products but we could 
include information on what products exists (open source and 
comercially) and a description of the purpose of each one and it's 
strong and weak points.
It would be valuable for whoever picks up the guide and for the 
companies aswell who would get their products reviewed by something 
becoming a web security testing reference.

Well just an idea, might just increase the companies efforts :-)

Another thing worth thinking about is how to present the results of the 
tests performed. Davids document started some speculations related to this.

That was what I meant, but let's finish part 2 first :o)

FYI This went down VERY well at the conference. I have received several
commendations on the work so far and a lot of people looking forward to
Part 1 and 2 release. 

 

I will get to this at the weekend or next Monday at the latest (I have a
day off to complete it on Monday) and we will then get it to the tech
writer and released. It shouldn't affect the ongoing Part 2 work though.

Sorry this took so long to do the last little bit.  I haven't had much
free time, and I'm limited how much I can do during work hours.  Here's
the doc.  The good news is, the tech writer is ready to go, as soon as
you can send back a cleaned up version I can put it in front of our tech
writer to get started on it.

Hey Robert, this is awesome. As the Testing Framework is generic, how about
someone creates a section on the OWASP site to house assessment for specific
technology and we start with this and the Sun One Web Server. Jeff, can the
OWASP admin create the pages etc ?

hey all, (also welcome to the new joiners)

It's been a while since i sent out the first one, we have had the OWASP 
conf in NY, a load of new joiners to the list and hopefully everyone 
has had time to think about what we will be including?

Lets get this section over and done with as soon as possible, so we can 
start working on the individual bits

with the content?

Thanks to Syed for supplying me the beautified workflow image!

Gray Box Testing - Dynamo Application ContainerYes, but I need to get some
procedures for changing content for him.  I also need some instructions for
building and deploying the site (build the WAR file) so he can test changes
himself.  The servers are build and hardened.  We still need to harden
Tomcat and install the portal.

David mentioned a writeup he was going to send.  Anybody else got anything
written down?

Hey Robert, this is awesome. As the Testing Framework is generic, how about
someone creates a section on the OWASP site to house assessment for specific
technology and we start with this and the Sun One Web Server. Jeff, can the
OWASP admin create the pages etc ?

Is there any reason why the flow chart is still the one I originally 
provided and not the latest one I sent? It is not correct and has a 
number of issues:

- "Is the type of information business critical?" has no "NO"
flow arrow and has two "YES" arrows
- There should be an arrow after "Contact the business
organization", otherwise, it's a black hole in the diagram.

The rest of the document looks ok to me.

> Thanks to Syed for supplying me the beautified workflow image!

I agree, it looks quite good to me.

Regards

Javier

Once again work is getting in the way and I am holding up the release of
this document. Do we have anyone with good English and a few hours (this
is really all it needs) to go through this final draft, accept changes
where appropriate and complete the minor sections that are not complete?


I would like to release this on Friday as a draft and send it to the
tech editor for its "tech editing re-write at the same time". 

I will send anyone who can do this in the next 48 hours an OWASP Polo
shirt if that's make a difference ;-)

Can anyone, with the relevant experience, help with these sections?

Chapter 5, which techniques..
Since im bad at doing pie charts, could anyone rustle up one for this?

1A ? SDLC Process Review

3B ? Code Reviews
Armed with a good understanding of how the code is structured and why
certain things were coded the way they were, the tester can now examine
the actual code for security defects.


Thanks,

Hi, I'm Sung-Koo Ryeo in Korea.

I had been translating the Penetration Checklist in May.
But, It was delayed by my personal problems..
In this time, I finished it which is based on Penetration Checklist ver 1.1.

I hope that this is released  when the Penetration Checklist is updated.

ps.
Jeff : Jeremy Bae is my co-worker... He and I wanted to participate in
OWASP, 
        so he translated Top Ten and  I translated this.
Mark : I'm very sorry to be late this work...  

Have a good time!
