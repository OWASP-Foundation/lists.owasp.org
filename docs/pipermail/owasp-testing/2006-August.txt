Hi there,

IIRC I wrote:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_configuration_management_testing
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Infrastructure_configuration_management_testing
and contributed to
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Old%2C_backup_and_unreferenced_files

I wrote a section on XSS a while back, but seems to be different than
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Cross_site_scripting_vulnerabilities
so I will use the wiki and expand that with the one I wrote back in 2004 
and some other info.

Javier

Hi Javier,

Do some searching around -- there are a few articles on XSS that need to
be pulled together and consolidated.  We should try to be clear about
what the article is actually about.  Is it a description of an XSS
vulnerability?  Or is it how to test for XSS?  Or is it a countermeasure
article on how to defend an application against XSS (ie.
Validation/Encoding).

We have the same problem with SQL injection right now, but it's getting
cleaned up.  Best thing you can do if you're not sure how to deal with
these collisions is to link to the other articles and indicate that
there might be some overlap.

Thanks,

--Jeff

Hi,
I threw in the current XSS text:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Cross_site_scripting_vulnerabilities
It needs to be expanded but it is a start.

Message-ID: <B9A412898630124ABE8350F4EBD32E840CE220@mymail.aspectsecurity.com>

I found articles on XSS including:
 - Cross Site Scripting (from CLASP - vulnerability)
 - Cross site scripting (from Top Ten - overview)
 - XSS Attacks (Eoin Code review guide -- not really attacks)
 - Testing for Cross site scripting vulnerabilities
 - ..and there's probably some coverage in the Guide

Anyone want to take on cleaning this up?  I'd like to see:
 - An awareness article (short, Top Ten)
 - A detailed article (Guide, links to more detailed articles)
 - An article about XSS Attacks -- how do attackers exploit, what tools
do they use
 - An article about XSS Vulnerabilities -- what do they look like, how
serious are they
 - An article about XSS Countermeasures -- with links to articles on
validation and encoding

Does this make sense?  I want to minimize redundancy and get things
organized.

Attention OWASP Community,

OWASP is moving all of our mailing lists off of SourceForge and onto our
own infrastructure. We?re making this move to allow for better control
over the mail infrastructure and to address some service problems we?ve
been experiencing. Your account will be moved automatically, and you
don?t need to take any action. However, you may want to set your spam
filter to allow messages from the new lists. All OWASP email lists will
come from @lists.owasp.org. All OWASP lists can be found at
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo

Thank you for your continued support of OWASP.

Message-ID: <20060823131001.Q12135-100000@redknuckle.sensepost.com>

Hi there,

Putting this out there because I think it could be interesting for a lot
of you that's doing web application testing on a regular basis. Try it and
see if it's going to work for you.

BlackHat 2006 Vegas presentation (Suru component) at
http://www.sensepost.com/research/suru/BH2006Suru.ppt

Your feedback always more than welcome.

Regards,
Roelof.

<blatant product rant>
Suru is a web application proxy that combines the best features of Wikto
and Crowbar as well as a very capable MiTM proxy. It understands XML and
Multi Part POSTS, which is good for thick clients using web services. Also
supports SSL - in the standard mitm configuration. Does file/directory
recon and works nicely with fuzzing parameters and grouping responses,
session saving, listening on all interfaces etc. etc. etc..Runs on .NET.

14 days eval, $200 to buy for life, no limitations, (and free
documentation ;)) at
