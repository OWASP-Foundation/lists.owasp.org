Hi,

 

I'm new to OWASP Testing Guide list.

 

I have seen some information in
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Credentials_Transported_over_an_
Encrypted_Channel_%28OWASP-AT-001%29 that I would like to modify because it
is incorrect. Should I directly edit the wiki or should I ask first in this
list?

Just read that article for the first time, I hope that your fixes include better guidance around an http page posting sensitive data to an https url; that needs to be called out as a vulnerability.

Protecting from Eve is good, but if you haven't accounted for Mallory you still have a major problem.

That is exactly the modification I though was important to include.

Hi,
Yes you can modify the wiki. I'll review it.

Thanks!

Subject: [Owasp-testing] User enumeration by timing attacks
Message-ID: <005601ce3065$fab7c220$f0274660$@seinhe.com>

Can we add in version 4 of the Testing Guide, timing attacks as a way of
Testing_for_User_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account?

 

In theory I think that some applications can be slower or faster when the
user exists or when the user does not exist. Analyzing this timing an
attacker can try to guess valid usernames/accounts.

Message-ID: <612cebd7bdc27c549e20336d8d47df95@localhost>

Hello! 

I am currently performing my master thesis on the topic of quantifying the
severity of 
software vulnerabilities.

As you have done significant work in this area, I would be glad if you
could spare a few
minutes of your time to answer a survey on the topic. It should not
require more than 15-20
minutes to complete.

The survey can be found at: http://secsurvey.ics.kth.se/index.php

Thank you for your attention!
