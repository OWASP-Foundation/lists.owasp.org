You haven't dispute the evidence that I have put forth?

No, no and no.

Dinis Cruz, as an OWASP Board Member, should *not* be allowed to
manage or lead his own OWASP Projects.  Neither should he be allowed
to direct &quot;charity&quot; funds to the development of a commercial product
owned by Security Innovation.

Reread <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2011-January/009563.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2011-January/009563.html</A>
that supports the above.

Furthermore, OWASP should not hire the wife of Dinis Cruz's personal
friend, Paulo Coimbra i.e.
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-January/004493.html">https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-January/004493.html</A>
to assist with Security Innvotations commercial exploitation of OWASP
when <A HREF="http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/05/sarah-baso-as-owasp-executive-director.html">http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/05/sarah-baso-as-owasp-executive-director.html</A>
has considerably more experience with OWASP.

... and who could forget Jeff Williams own opinion of Security
Innovation i.e.
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-August/006011.html">https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-August/006011.html</A>

Sonatype was founded by former employees of 02 and Josh Corman worked
for Rugged Software.

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Rugged_Software">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Rugged_Software</A> &lt;- WTF is this doing
on the OWASP Wiki? 0WASP &quot;02 With Aspect Security Promotion&quot;  :-)

BTW No one expect for Dinis Cruz has any idea what 02 does and Dinis
doesn't help it when he references other well known projects, such as
HacmeBank.  Mark Curphey refers to this as [Dinis Cruz] &quot;lost in 02
world&quot;.

I don't have an issue with Simon but the fact is Michael Coates, him
and you have all worked for Mozilla and yet OWASP invested in WebScrab
in the past.  In Simon's defence he probably didn't know about
WebScrab because OWASP didn't help with the promotion of known
projects since hired Dinis Cruz hired personal friends to promote his
own projects.

Yeah, so in essence what Jim is now doing is what Dinis Cruz should
have completed three years ago but didn't.

The OWASP Testing Guide is a documentation project and as far as I am
aware is out of being demoted now?

&lt;- Yeah, Dinis Cruz just wants to see the world burn.

BTW I don't see how your reply is relevant to the OWASP Testing Guide.
