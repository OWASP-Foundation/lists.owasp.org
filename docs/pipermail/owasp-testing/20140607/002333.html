<PRE>Simon,

No offence but I have to correct your record.

You promoted ZAP to OWASP as a web proxy intended for developers and
not webappsec professionals and your subsequent development has
focused on features for the webappsec end user.  For comparison
purposes <A HREF="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">http://www.charlesproxy.com/</A> development has continued to
focus on web application developers.

I would assume that Paros had no end users and that its developer(s)
either didn't respond or refused to accept your patches (I am not sure
of the exact background) because they no longer wanted to maintain
Paros.  Furthermore, a majority of WebScarab end users where
transiting <A HREF="http://portswigger.net/burp/">http://portswigger.net/burp/</A> which has a modest fee to
support its development.

Paros has the worst UI have ever seen and ZAP has not improved on the
UI after I tried it based on the recommendation of &quot;The Testicles&quot;
i.e. <A HREF="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=sergicles%20ZAP&amp;src=typd">https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=sergicles%20ZAP&amp;src=typd</A>

Your promotion of ZAP on mailing lists not hosted by OWASP appears to
the public that WebScarab that it is no longer being developed and is
therefore devalued.

Both you and Michael (OWASP Chair) work[ed] at Mozilla and this is a
conflict of interest.  Also, Paul Theriaut (Mozilla) wanted to present
ZAP during the very unsuccessful relaunch of the OWASP Sydney,
Australia Chapter, of which he is also one of the [chapter] leaders
of.

Those are the facts as I understand them, please let me know if I am incorrect?
