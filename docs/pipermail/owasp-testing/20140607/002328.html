If *you* are aware of ongoing corruption, then *you* collect the evidence,
and put forward a proposal for a review.  I am not going to.  I have a
career, run a separate non-profit, contribute to owasp, organize several
local groups, and have a family; I don't (and most of the other OWASP
leaders probably don't) have time to investigate it for you.  I am happy
with the direction that OWASP is going, and support the direction that the
current board is moving in.  I am not going to do your work for you.

Wait what? The people who are most invested in the success of their
projects that are contributed to OWASP shouldn't be allowed take on a
position of greater responsibility to ensure the success of the community
in addition to their own project?  I don't know if you have leadership or
management experience, but in general, you want to promote and/or recruit
people that show initiative.

I tend to agree (where &quot;Security Innovation&quot; is replaced with &quot;a for-profit
business&quot;).  So, take the initiative, collect the evidence, and build a
case.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW No one expect for Dinis Cruz has any idea what 02 does and Dinis

</I>&gt;<i> HacmeBank.  Mark Curphey refers to this as [Dinis Cruz] &quot;lost in 02

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So this is a stream of consciousness style write-up that doesn't really
make clear sense to me without reading the supporting docs.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have an issue with Simon but the fact is Michael Coates, him
</I>&gt;<i> and you have all worked for Mozilla and yet OWASP invested in WebScrab
</I>&gt;<i> in the past.
</I>

Yeah, you might want to educate yourself on the history of ZAP before you
put your foot in your mouth.  Simon implemented ZAP before he was involved
with OWASP, and made a strong positive contribution to OWASP out of the
gate.

I don't know why you want to drag my employer into this; all three of the
people named were OWASP contributors before joining Mozilla, and actually
ramped up their involvement after joining Mozilla.


&gt;<i> In Simon's defence he probably didn't know about
</I>&gt;<i> WebScrab because OWASP didn't help with the promotion of known
</I>&gt;<i> projects since hired Dinis Cruz hired personal friends to promote his
</I>&gt;<i> own projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sorry to break it to you, but no amount of promotion would have saved
WebScarab.  It was a powerful and flexible tool, but it had a painful UI, a
terrible learning curve.  ZAP is successful because it was a natural
progression of an effectively abandoned (but still popular) tool, a
generous helping of new features, and alot of UI love.

</I>
Again, what?  You are complaining that a current board member is doing
something you felt was long needed?  I am not sure what your point is.
Dinis isn't on the board.  Focusing your aggression and frustration on a
single (or a small group) of individuals really detracts from any
significant point you are trying to make.  I have yet to see a single
constructive point come out of anything you have said in this thread.  That
deficiency, by the way, coupled with your accusations and tone are the main
reasons I felt the need to respond.  You aren't contributing in a
constructive fashion, you are actively undermining folks (Jim, Johanna)
that are, and you are wasting peoples ime.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The OWASP Testing Guide is a documentation project and as far as I am
</I>&gt;<i> aware is out of being demoted now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If so, it is my opinion that it is a mistake; once the clearly defined
criteria for being a flagship project are available, the projects should be
made to apply, with no grandfathering.  This forces projects to meet a
quality assurance guideline that means something.

&gt;<i> BTW I don't see how your reply is relevant to the OWASP Testing Guide.
</I>&gt;<i>

I reference the testing guide a fair bit.  I have designed several training
courses that reference them; I am interested in seeing the Guide remain a
flagship project, but not at the expense of seeing a process implemented
that says the 'Flagship' stamp actually means something.

You are correct.  Pushing to the leaders list since this makes more sense
there.  I don't care much about the issues you have with past board
members, unless you are going to position them in way that focuses on being
constructive (learning from mistakes made in the past is constructive,
dwelling on them isn't).

Cheers,
Yvan
