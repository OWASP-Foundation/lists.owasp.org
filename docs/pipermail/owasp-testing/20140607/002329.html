<PRE>Thanks for bringing this discussion to the leaders list.  I can certainly
see how someone, especially those running projects, would see this Flagship
status demotion as a hassle at best and perhaps even &quot;catastrophic&quot; as
Christian put it.  I was, admittedly, a bit skeptical of the value of such
an action when the idea was first brought to me, but upon further
consideration, I changed my mind.  People around the world have come to
respect the OWASP name as a trusted source for tools and documentation, but
when they come to our website, their experience can vary based on where
they land.  Think about how you'd feel if you downloaded an OWASP
&quot;Flagship&quot; document with outdated information or a &quot;Flagship&quot; tool that
actually created security vulnerabilities when you used it.  It becomes a
situation where the proverbial one rotten apple can spoil the entire
bunch.  Sure, you could make the argument that we could evaluate each
current Flagship project and then demote on a case-by-case basis, and you'd
probably be right, but as hard as the evaluator would try to be objective,
in the end someone is probably going to get upset and cry foul.  With this
action, we have leveled the playing field (so to speak) and the projects
that advance back to Flagship can do so under the full support of the
community.

I don't think that it's in anybody's best interest to be in this limbo
state for long and in the interests of expediting the process, I just threw
out some ideas on what &quot;Flagship&quot; means to me here:

<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2014-June/011888.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2014-June/011888.html</A>

These are just suggestions, nothing set in stone, and I'm hoping that you
guys will follow up with your feedback and perhaps even your own
suggestions.  In a nutshell, how do we define a process that ensures that
when a person goes to OWASP and downloads a Flagship document, we know,
without hesitation, that it will be a high quality product that they can
rely on?  I'd say let's take the next week or so to solicit feedback from
the community, and then maybe you guys would be interested in helping to
assemble the pieces that make up the final process?  Johanna is already
working on putting the pieces in place for the code projects and I'm happy
to try to get the ball rolling on the documentation projects as well.  All
things considered, I bet we can have a process in place in the next 2-4
weeks.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't have an issue with Simon but the fact is Michael Coates, him
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and you have all worked for Mozilla and yet OWASP invested in WebScrab

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, you might want to educate yourself on the history of ZAP before you
</I>&gt;<i> put your foot in your mouth.  Simon implemented ZAP before he was involved
</I>&gt;<i> with OWASP, and made a strong positive contribution to OWASP out of the
</I>&gt;<i> gate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know why you want to drag my employer into this; all three of the
</I>&gt;<i> people named were OWASP contributors before joining Mozilla, and actually
</I>&gt;<i> ramped up their involvement after joining Mozilla.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In Simon's defence he probably didn't know about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WebScrab because OWASP didn't help with the promotion of known
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects since hired Dinis Cruz hired personal friends to promote his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> own projects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to break it to you, but no amount of promotion would have saved
</I>&gt;<i> WebScarab.  It was a powerful and flexible tool, but it had a painful UI, a
</I>&gt;<i> terrible learning curve.  ZAP is successful because it was a natural
</I>&gt;<i> progression of an effectively abandoned (but still popular) tool, a
</I>&gt;<i> generous helping of new features, and alot of UI love.
