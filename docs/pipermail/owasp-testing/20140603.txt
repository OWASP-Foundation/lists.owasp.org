Jim,

I do not believe that you intended to offend the other OWASP Projects that
have maintained their flagship status, rather this is damaging oversight of
the OWASP Board.

Your statement "Unfortunately, some of our flagship projects have not been
active and have languished" does not apply to the v4 release of the OWASP
Testing Guide which has been active for over a year.  I believe ZAP is also
under active ongoing development too based on the announcements I have
observed from Simon aka psiinon.

Can you please advise if a demoted OWASP Project would be required to
adhere to a revised standard or the existing standard for flagship project
will remain?

If so I would like to apply for the release of the OWASP Testing Guide v4
to be of flagship status?
