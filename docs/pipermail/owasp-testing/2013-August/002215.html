<PRE>Pete,

I addressed a similar e-mail at
<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-August/002211.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-August/002211.html</A>
but  I figured I would take you up on your offer and see if
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001</A>)
was within the OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf and here are the steps below:

1. Upon clicking
<A HREF="https://www.isecom.org/silverteam/OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf">https://www.isecom.org/silverteam/OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf</A> I was
redirected to <A HREF="https://www.isecom.org/members/plugins/protect/new_rewrite/login.php?v=-1,2,13,7,14,5&amp;url=/silverteam/OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf">https://www.isecom.org/members/plugins/protect/new_rewrite/login.php?v=-1,2,13,7,14,5&amp;url=/silverteam/OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf</A>

2. I clicked &quot;Signup here&quot; i.e. &quot;Not registered yet? Signup here&quot;

3. Silver Registration is listed as $99 USD on
<A HREF="https://www.isecom.org/members/signup.php">https://www.isecom.org/members/signup.php</A>

Therefore, since I refuse to pay and your recent offer was to provide
me this free of charge I can only conclude that
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001</A>)
is not part of OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf  since after Telstra had
assured the public that it would never happen again i.e.
<A HREF="http://conference.auscert.org.au/conf2012/speaker_Scott_McIntyre.html">http://conference.auscert.org.au/conf2012/speaker_Scott_McIntyre.html</A>
and after extensive audits where undertaken by I assume
<A HREF="http://www.purehacking.com/about-us/our-team,">http://www.purehacking.com/about-us/our-team,</A> who &quot;... are regular
contributors the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual
(OSSTMM), certified Trainers of Penetration Testing Professionals of
OSSTMM, ...&quot;  <A HREF="http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/oops-google-search-reveals-private-telstra-customer-data-20130516-2jnmw.html">http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/oops-google-search-reveals-private-telstra-customer-data-20130516-2jnmw.html</A>
occurred almost 1.5 years later or almost five years after the
publication of the OWASP Testing Guide v3.

Also, <A HREF="http://www.wireheadsecurity.com/owasp-nc-october-2010-with-pete-herzog-from-isecom">http://www.wireheadsecurity.com/owasp-nc-october-2010-with-pete-herzog-from-isecom</A>
-&gt; <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/owaspnc/events/14603102/">http://www.meetup.com/owaspnc/events/14603102/</A> -&gt;
<A HREF="http://www.isecom.org/team.html">http://www.isecom.org/team.html</A> shows the conflict of interest of
OWASP NC Chapter and ISECOM.

&gt;<i> Hi Christian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm aware of your work on CVSSv3 from your posts on the DailyDave
</I>&gt;<i> list. As far as I can tell it's not done yet or there's no further
</I>&gt;<i> development except what's posted here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.first.org/cvss/v3/development">http://www.first.org/cvss/v3/development</A>
</I>&gt;<i> There doesn't seem to be a public link. So it seems to be a closed
</I>&gt;<i> development group as I couldn't easily see how I could get a copy of
</I>&gt;<i> of cvssv3 to read. It's just not developed in a transparent manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then again maybe that's all perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OSSTMM is also developed by a team of volunteers and to gain access to
</I>&gt;<i> the development you need to help work on it or financially support
</I>&gt;<i> development. When it's done we publish it for free as Open Source as
</I>&gt;<i> we have 8 other times before this coming version 4. It helps us keep
</I>&gt;<i> the project alive as well as keeping people from using an unfinished
</I>&gt;<i> version and being unsatisfied, never to return again even once it's
</I>&gt;<i> been improved. More than unsatisfied, the importance of security
</I>&gt;<i> testing and measurements is so vital to many organizations that we
</I>&gt;<i> need to be REALLY sure they know what is experimental and what isn't
</I>&gt;<i> so as not to aide in someone screwing up a test for following an
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete instruction set. And the team/subscriber hoop people need
</I>&gt;<i> to jump through solves that problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a lot of way to do open source and there's a lot of ways to
</I>&gt;<i> provide transparency. We do it through our teams and our lists as they
</I>&gt;<i> also suggest here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensource.com/life/13/7/10-secrets-open-source-communities">http://opensource.com/life/13/7/10-secrets-open-source-communities</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you wanted to see and try the OSSTMM web app testing in development
</I>&gt;<i> you could have let us know and done some review for us or at least
</I>&gt;<i> give feedback if you were going to read it anyway. But you didn't
</I>&gt;<i> contact anyone in the team and you didn't ask for a copy anywhere I
</I>&gt;<i> can see. Just like I didn't with CVSSv3 when I didn't find it right
</I>&gt;<i> away. But I didn't call it closed source or not transparent. It is
</I>&gt;<i> what it is and if I think I need it, I'll ask. Just like many students
</I>&gt;<i> using OSSTMM in there thesis ask us for a copy of the latest stuff and
</I>&gt;<i> we give it to them because they give back by applying our stuff in
</I>&gt;<i> real and new ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, we did introduce the document within OWASP at a public
</I>&gt;<i> meeting to get feedback from web developers and testers:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://seclists.org/webappsec/2010/q3/49">http://seclists.org/webappsec/2010/q3/49</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry if this escaped your notice. But we do them every once in a
</I>&gt;<i> while so maybe you can catch the next somewhere, even on your continent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And by the way, I'm all for an OWASP Risk Rating. I think risk ratings
</I>&gt;<i> are quite personal so they offer an interesting perspective based on
</I>&gt;<i> the concerns of the organization developing them. They expand the
</I>&gt;<i> thought field of security and help people frame what's important to
</I>&gt;<i> them in the realm of that metric. With a field as big and imprecise as
</I>&gt;<i> security we need all the new ideas we can get.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> -pete.
