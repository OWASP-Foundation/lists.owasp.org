CVSSv3 is still under active development i.e. I believe this was
obvious since &quot;development&quot; is quoted within the URI i.e.

If you understood this thread on the Top Ten Mailing List then OWASP
tends to lean towards transparency (including the refusal of NDAs).
This policy tends to be enforced when it suits the ulterior motive of
the person i.e for an example of OWASP own hypocrisy related to the
thread on the Top Ten Mailing List then refer to later paragraphs from
Jeff within <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-August/006011.html">https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-August/006011.html</A>

Well is appears &quot;regular contributors the Open Source Security Testing
Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), certified Trainers of Penetration Testing
Professionals of OSSTMM&quot; from Pure Hacking are &quot;...regularly ..&quot;
caught out making inaccurate claims &quot;... in Australia&#8217;s media.&quot; time
after time e.g.
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/thomsons-phone-clone-claims-uncertain-1339338352/">http://www.zdnet.com/thomsons-phone-clone-claims-uncertain-1339338352/</A>

&gt;<i>From memory of my reading at the time it appeared that OSSTMM hadn't
</I>considered the ramification that an experienced auditor cannot provide
their referees to prior penetration test which therefore left the
person evaluating the proposal without an independent view and
therefore might result in the lesser experienced auditor being awarded
the opportunity.

The above doesn't convince me that you intent is to otherwise extract
as much revenue out of the market while being in denial about high

OSSTMM has been in a steady decline which has upheld my first impression.

To select one of several stories that I have heard, it took a
webappsec subcontractor to &quot;Pure Hacking&quot; 1 hour to bypass a simple
authentication framework which Ty Miller had wasted two days
attempting to figure out without any tangible result.

I'll locate the e-mail(s) from Raoul and send them to you but I would
have preferred not to do this since my brief dealings with Raoul have
always been positive since we avoided discussing his association with
convicted criminal Kevin Mitnick e.g.
<A HREF="https://twitter.com/kevinmitnick/status/30784499897860097">https://twitter.com/kevinmitnick/status/30784499897860097</A>

Since my other recent e-mail hasn't been reflected in the mailing list

I won't have interpreted that as an endorsement otherwise I would have
contributed to OSSTMM.

Coincidently what you may have heard about
<A HREF="http://cmlh.id.au/tagged/grubbgate">http://cmlh.id.au/tagged/grubbgate</A> wasn't an accurate version of
events of what I presented at Security B-Sides in 2011 and you may
also want to pay particular attention to

To link this back to &quot;Pure Hacking&quot;, I was disappointed when Ty
attempt to exploit this unfortunate situation for &quot;Pure Hacking&quot; gain
i.e. <A HREF="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/facebook-images-open-to-access/story-e6frgakx-1226059138255,">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/facebook-images-open-to-access/story-e6frgakx-1226059138255,</A>
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com.au/stuxnet-routing-hacks-and-a-seized-ipad-339315484.htm,">http://www.zdnet.com.au/stuxnet-routing-hacks-and-a-seized-ipad-339315484.htm,</A>
etc in light of:
1.  &quot;Pure Hacking&quot; appearance on
<A HREF="http://www.sbs.com.au/insight/episode/transcript/30/Stolen-IDTV">http://www.sbs.com.au/insight/episode/transcript/30/Stolen-IDTV</A> and
associated comments hyped with delusion of grandeurs.
2.  &quot;Pure Hacking&quot; reversal on seeking permission from the end user of
social network i.e. content on social networks is public domain i.e.
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/penetration-testing-employees-social-media-to-improve-policy-7000017234/.">http://www.zdnet.com/penetration-testing-employees-social-media-to-improve-policy-7000017234/.</A>
 Their claim about &quot;no one else in the world is currently doing&quot; is
pure fabrication too due to my prior work and that of Tom Ryan i.e.
&quot;Robin Sage&quot;, IOActive i.e. &quot;The Leaky Web: Owning Your Favorite
CEOs&quot;, etc

</I>
I have no association with the development of CVSSv3 aside from
<A HREF="http://cmlh.id.au/post/25150772855/cvssv3-call-subjects">http://cmlh.id.au/post/25150772855/cvssv3-call-subjects</A> which was open
to the public.  I am *not* a member of the CVSS-SIG.

Rather, I recommend CVSS because it is assists in prioritising the
workaround and/or patches from multiple vendors.

The difference is that scientists publish in journals, of majority are

This wasn't the purpose of the 2.2 (or earlier) release of OSSTMM (I
remember it had alot of content about nmap results) but I can't
comment on the more recent releases since I haven't read them.

If ISECOM had been less concerned about creating profit and more
concerned with the implementation of transparency as part of the
development of OSSTMM then possibly the people saw the potential of
OSSTMM would be promoting on your behalf today.

There is no collusion between these parties so each opinion can be
considered independent.

I will state again that one of these parties is an OWASP Board Member.

I neither have the power or desire to politically block people within
OWASP.  Rather I am attempting to guide people to better alternatives,
such as CVSS and ISO 31000 based on my own experience with the OWASP
Risk Rating Methodology.

Marco, Josh and anyone else is more than welcome disregard my advice
and update the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.
