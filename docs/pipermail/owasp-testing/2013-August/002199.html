<PRE>Christian, thanks for the correction in regarding CVSS origins. I think my confusion is from the fact that Steve Christey, of the MITRE Corporation, who edits Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is also member of FIRST but indeed this is not MITRE's child, CVE is, my fault.

I do not have a view on the other points you are making but I do not agree the OWASP risk methodology is &quot;flawed&quot; so it can be rejected entirely. I am in favor of a revision same as CVSS had revisions as well. In my opinion, I believe in &quot;increased maturity through continuous improvements&quot;. I also think this discussion should be brought up to the people that are mentioned in this email so they can excise their opinion and we can have a fair discussion on this topic.

I am copying Tom if he things this discussion should be brought to a larger group including the authors of the OWASP risk methodology  :)

cheers, Marco

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am favor of endorsing MITRE's CVSS since this is almost widely accepted industry standard for vulnerability risk scoring. Nevertheless,  I think there is value in guiding users of the testing guide on the use of other qualitative risk assessment methodologies as a reference. Based upon my experience, organizations do not just rely on CVSS for vulnerability risk management but to their risk management process and acceptable risk levels. I think keeping the current OWASP risk scoring has value for comparison and can be corrected for the risk factors of threats vs risk factors of vulnerabilities (discussion on threat agent skills) and overall weight calculation formula as well as for covering at least five levels instead of three (H,M,L). The comparison between CVSS and OWASP risk rating can also be used as benchmark and to highlight that ultimately there is no one best risk methodology but consistent assessment of risk using different criteria.

</I>&gt;<i> Aspect Security have leveraged the flawed OWASP Risk Rating for their
</I>&gt;<i> own commercial vested interests.
