<PRE>Pete,

I would appreciate if you could consolidate the multiple threads you
have created on the OWASP Testing Guide Mailing List around the same
subject into a single thread if you have something more to add.

Also Raoul, Ty (once his new e-mail address is known) and Michael are
more then welcome to subscribe to the mailing list as per the simple
instructions listed at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing</A> which I assume
is the reason that these multiple threads are created as you left off
one or more e-mail addresses?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I have been familiar with OSSTMM since release v2 (maybe earlier)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from memory.  The reason that I walked away from it was that it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full of self righteous statements related to ethics and &quot;Hacking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Exposed&quot; has more technical content while being what is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sensationalised publication (i.e. &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There'll always be haters. But what you point to is the Rules of
</I>&gt;<i> Engagement which were designed to protect the tester not force ethics
</I>&gt;<i> on them. You don't have to follow them to do an OSSTMM test but they
</I>&gt;<i> will help you as a security professional. Too often pen testers were
</I>&gt;<i> caught in Catch22 situations where they did their job but the
</I>&gt;<i> remediation wasn't done or some contract details were missing, or the
</I>&gt;<i> client made the scope too narrow and then there were problems, the
</I>&gt;<i> company gets hacked, and people point and say, XYZ did our security!
</I>&gt;<i> And XYZ signed an NDA that doesn't let them refute or explain that
</I>&gt;<i> they tested under restrictions or had nothing to do with remediation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, we never wanted to compete with hacking exposed. We're a
</I>&gt;<i> research organization looking for the best way to test and analyze
</I>&gt;<i> operations to secure them. That's enough work without trying to detail
</I>&gt;<i> how to exploit each bug that might not even be a technology in use
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Neither would the markings of both &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Draft&quot; convince me to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read your webappsec methodology since it doesn't have the same peer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reviewed contributors as the OWASP Testing Guide,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mdsec.net/wahh/,">http://mdsec.net/wahh/,</A> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay. Sorry we lost you then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Raoul Chiesa and I know each other from presenting at the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conference in Europe. Coincidently he want me to replace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://msmvps.com/blogs/spywaresucks/archive/2011/12/10/1803461.aspx">http://msmvps.com/blogs/spywaresucks/archive/2011/12/10/1803461.aspx</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as the Australian representative for  <A HREF="http://www.isecom.org/team.html">http://www.isecom.org/team.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because of their well known lack of skill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like Ty and I think he's a capable tester. You posting a link to a
</I>&gt;<i> blog where someone states their opinion doesn't prove a &quot;well known
</I>&gt;<i> lack of skill&quot;. And Raoul has never said anything to me about this but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to include him here (in CC). I can't imagine he said to
</I>&gt;<i> replace Ty as we don't &quot;replace&quot; people on the team, we grow it.
</I>&gt;<i> Because we can all learn things from each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The link you post about Ty's skill again goes back to what I said
</I>&gt;<i> about that Catch 22. I don't know details or have access to the
</I>&gt;<i> confidential security reports as you apparently do but when I see that
</I>&gt;<i> I see so many possibilities where someone got it wrong that I don't
</I>&gt;<i> immediately blame the tester. There's the scope of the test,
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions on types of tests, remediation, etc. I just hope you
</I>&gt;<i> never find yourself in that situation as it can happen to ANY tester.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After watching the heckling from the audience at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.sector.ca/speakers2008.htm#Pete_Herzog">http://www.sector.ca/speakers2008.htm#Pete_Herzog</A> I can't see the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional value in travelling to North Carolina.  I believe the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just so glad they didn't do it out loud as that would have thrown
</I>&gt;<i> me off my presentation! I didn't even know about it. It was hard
</I>&gt;<i> enough since I was presenting on the New New Thieves, which was based
</I>&gt;<i> on work that Raoul Chiesa (you mentioned above as your endorsement)
</I>&gt;<i> pioneered with the United Nations for profiling hackers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> positive reviews of the North Carolina event are attributed to Michael
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Menefee not disclosing his conflict of interest i.e.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.isecom.org/team.html.">http://www.isecom.org/team.html.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike joined ISECOM about a month after that event. I don't see how
</I>&gt;<i> that's a conflict of interest to invite me as a speaker either though.
</I>&gt;<i> As an example of what might be a conflict of interest is someone
</I>&gt;<i> trying to shut down OWASP risk metrics because of their work CVSS v3.
</I>&gt;<i> But that's just an opinion too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This endorsement of the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology is the similar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to that from people who believe vulnerability assessment is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different name of penetration testing and therefore consider OSSTMM as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a creditable body of knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't follow that line of thinking. But I do believe nobody
</I>&gt;<i> sits on all the great ideas- no person and no group. I think people
</I>&gt;<i> should work in the areas they see they can improve because of their
</I>&gt;<i> specialized knowledge and even if it's not a flawless body of work,
</I>&gt;<i> there are still likely to be some worthwhile ideas in it. Having
</I>&gt;<i> worked with attack surface metrics on web apps I know it is hard and
</I>&gt;<i> so I'm interested to see how another approaches it. And that's how
</I>&gt;<i> science works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OSSTMM is neither vuln testing or pen testing. It's a methodology
</I>&gt;<i> which shows that no matter what you call what you do, you need to get
</I>&gt;<i> XYZ intelligence from it so you know where your problems are. If you
</I>&gt;<i> can do that with a vuln scanner or a red team or a magic wand, that's
</I>&gt;<i> okay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Due to criticisms of OSSTMM from multiple parties with no relationship
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to each other (hence no collusion) i.e.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Research is supposed to have critics. That's how progress happens. And
</I>&gt;<i> then whenever you put yourself out there, well, there'll always be
</I>&gt;<i> haters. That's life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://infosecwarrior.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/ptes-penetration-testing-execution-standard/,">http://infosecwarrior.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/ptes-penetration-testing-execution-standard/,</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twitter.com/mhackling/status/46376971336290304,">https://twitter.com/mhackling/status/46376971336290304,</A> etc OWASP has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aligned itself with PTES too i.e.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twitter.com/indi303/status/78476821305360385">https://twitter.com/indi303/status/78476821305360385</A> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twitter.com/brennantom/status/78431000081858560.">https://twitter.com/brennantom/status/78431000081858560.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So some blog that makes up a percentage in passing about the OSSTMM
</I>&gt;<i> and 3 twitter feeds is &quot;multiple criticisms&quot;? Your old drama teacher
</I>&gt;<i> must be proud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stop being so negative and so conflicted and just enjoy that there's
</I>&gt;<i> so many people trying to figure out how best to secure the world.
</I>&gt;<i> There's a lot of work to do so just do your thing and stop trying to
</I>&gt;<i> block others from doing theirs.
