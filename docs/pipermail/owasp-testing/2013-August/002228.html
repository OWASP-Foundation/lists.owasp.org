<PRE>Pete,

CVSSv3 isn't &quot;research&quot;, rather its a standard where multiple
stakeholders vote on the inclusion of subject solicited from the
community.  There is no money exchanged.

OSSTMM is a perpetually closed draft created without seek community
(i.e. outside of ISECOM membership) consensus.

FIRST had a &quot;Call for Participants&quot; and their selection was

ISECOM have to accept anyone because there is no value in being
associated with your brand and therefore no competition for placement.
 I would welcome ISECOM to host a similar &quot;Call for Participants&quot; in
order to prove this statement incorrect?

I would be interest to know then as to why &quot;Pure Hacking&quot;, who
contribute to OSSTMM and subsequently claim to adhere to the OSSTMM,
and are well known to deliver poor and incomplete testing i.e.

have continued to be allow to contribute to the OSSTMM in light of the
above statement then?

<A HREF="http://www.pentest-standard.org/">http://www.pentest-standard.org/</A> was created due to the lack of
technical direction and lack of vigor required for the OSSTMM.

I am fairly well known for developing my own webappsec exploits.
However, I have provided an independent opinion on Pure Hacking
deliverables for companies in the past and these findings has included
the identification of the webappsec product and the level of vigor was
identified was that of the lowest level i.e. automation only i.e. Pure
Hacking has listed a number of false positives as filler and padding
of their deliverable.

This isn't anecdotal evidence if the same conclusion is drawn by
multiple experts (i.e. those who are peer reviewed) about &quot;Pure
Hacking&quot;

A convicted criminal is someone who has been convicted of a crime i.e.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure. After how many years? I won't hold my breath.
</I>
The ulterior motive the recent offer to contribute to OSSTMM is based
on the likelihood that it will be refused since politically I can
claim that I tried to contribute but your pride prohibited me.

Please refer to the dispute above related to your use of the term
&quot;anecdotal evidence&quot; which would incorporate &quot;indirect evidence&quot; too.

</I>
The Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability vector of the Base
Metric of CVSS have no relationship to the risk defined within ISO
31000.

I would assume CIA defined within CVSS is more relevant to how you
defined them too.

Scientific research is peered reviewed by those outside of their team.
 &quot;peer review&quot; by the larger security community isn't engaged by
ISECOM.

If ISECOM had created a new &quot;brand&quot; based on a fork of OSSTMM (which
would also be deprecated) then I don't believe you would continue to
experience the same level of resistance today.

I don't believe these blog posts exist and if they did it would be in
reference to the harm reduction in smoking a regulated product as
opposed to those manufactured by illicit trade.

I did support CVSSv1 based on my prior knowledge of Mike Schiffman's
other research in low level network packet manipulation i.e.

You should have done this in the first instance since this thread has
no relevance to the OWASP Testing Guide.
