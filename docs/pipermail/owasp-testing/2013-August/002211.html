The link to the CVSS-SIG is prominently displayed on the left side of
the <A HREF="http://www.first.org/">http://www.first.org/</A> homepage

Furthermore, all patents and other intellectual property rights have
to be surrendered to participate in the development of the CVSS and as
far as I am aware this is above what even OWASP requires.

OWASP has also followed a similar &quot;secret&quot; process as

Yes, I have been familiar with OSSTMM since release v2 (maybe earlier)
from memory.  The reason that I walked away from it was that it was
full of self righteous statements related to ethics and &quot;Hacking
Exposed&quot; has more technical content while being what is a
sensationalised publication (i.e. &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot;).

Neither would the markings of both &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Draft&quot; convince me to
read your webappsec methodology since it doesn't have the same peer
reviewed contributors as the OWASP Testing Guide,
<A HREF="http://mdsec.net/wahh/,">http://mdsec.net/wahh/,</A> etc.

Raoul Chiesa and I know each other from presenting at the same
conference in Europe. Coincidently he want me to replace

as the Australian representative for  <A HREF="http://www.isecom.org/team.html">http://www.isecom.org/team.html</A>
because of their well known lack of skill.

After watching the heckling from the audience at

additional value in travelling to North Carolina.  I believe the
positive reviews of the North Carolina event are attributed to Michael
Menefee not disclosing his conflict of interest i.e.

This endorsement of the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology is the similar
to that from people who believe vulnerability assessment is a
different name of penetration testing and therefore consider OSSTMM as
a creditable body of knowledge.

Due to criticisms of OSSTMM from multiple parties with no relationship
to each other (hence no collusion) i.e.

aligned itself with PTES too i.e.
