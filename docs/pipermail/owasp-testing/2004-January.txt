Sorry everyone.  You lost me for a couple of weeks.  Over the next few days I'll be catching up, reading e-mails, seeing how the feedback is going,  and doing the things I need to do.

I had the impression a high level view was needed. In any case, 
wouldn't it be best if we completed all the different items in Part 2 
(since it seems that some did not provide the sections asked for) and, 
when all the different items are finished (even if at a high-level) 
work in detailing each one?

That way OWASP could provide a high-level view for Part 2, and ask for 
contributors/reviews while we were working for a more detailed 
document.....

Regards

Javi

Javier,

We could. What seems to have happened with  many projects is;

Lots of volunteers
most never do anything
Pm's always fail us
General quality of submissions is poor

That leaves me having to deal with the mails, the work that was promised and the general admin. I just dont have capacity or motivation. i decided a while back its more effective to just write it rather than talk about writing it so thats what i am doing. Part 1 is almost complete...i am sorry past experience affects u a new guys but we would just not get anything done if we operated in the old way....that said if you write a detailled how to for a topic it will get used either on testing or as a whiepaper so pls, get typing and be creative !
