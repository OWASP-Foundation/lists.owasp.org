Hi everyone,

Sorry for the delay in getting this underway.  It has been suggested that we may want to parcel this down into smaller components and get some relevant pieces published.  How many times have you heard about this project being mentioned with a publication date of "real soon now"?

I think it is a valid suggestion to take testing pieces as they are completed and publish them on the website as well as include them in the final document.  How does everyone feel about this?

David has provided us with a copy of Section1 of the document, which the team pretty much finished working on at the end of March.  I will be forwarding the document in a separate e-mail.  It includes the scope and introduction for the Testing document.  I would suggest that everyone read this document as it is key to how the rest of the document will be laid out.

The last "whole" document that I have been able to find was sent to this mailing list on March 18, 2003 by David Endler.  If there is a more current version of it, please share it.  Otherwise, that is what we will use as our basis.  

I've been informed that DocBook is not necessary for the format of the document and is probably a little unweildy for what we are trying to accomplish - anyone else agree with that statement? :)  In an effort to keep everything standardized, we have been asked to start with HTML as our basis with the possibility of using the new oPortal to publish.  You do not need to submit your writing in HTML format!  Use your favorite text editor and I should be able to do the conversion.  I work off a dual boot laptop and have most of the usual software (open office, microsoft office, visio, photoshop, dreamweaver, etc).  

I am also going to post the current (as of March, 2003) Table of Contents.  I have clearly marked where the section which was completed ends.  Everything below that point is up for grabs.  Some of the sections look like they might be ready for peer review others are partially completed (please, please look at the March 18th document in the archives - if have a problem getting to them, let me know).

I discoververed last night that we have a 40K limit on the e-mail (+attachment) size to the mailing list, so I couldn't post the docs.  I'm in the process of finding an online home for our draft documents.

Hi all,

I'm back on-line (in Brisbane now) and it's a week 'til I start work
again.

I therefore have time on my hands and am keen to help get the testing
guide back on track.

Some great news......Penny Major has graciously stepped up to the plate
and offered to project manage testing. This is great news. Penny and I
briefly discussed changing the way the project would operate using oFlow
and getting authors to create discrete write-ups on individual topics
that can later be combined into the overall testing document. I will
leave it all up to her from here on in.
 
I believe a template will follow and a list to sign-up to write content.
 
Thank Penny, you da woman !

Assunto: Asp.Net Security Analyser

Hello, we have just released the first stable version of our new Open
Source Project: the Asp.Net Security Analyser (ANSA)

Asp.Net Security Analyser (ANSA) is a Open Source, Windows based, online
tool, that tests the server's security for known vulnerabilities and
mis-configurations. The tool was initially designed to allow the
protection of ISPs that provide shared hosting services. You can
download the source code, use it in your servers and distribute it to
who ever you feel appropriate.

The project's objective is to create an Open Source tool that allows
system administrators (responsible for windows based shared hosting
environments) to easily identify and solve existent security problems.

The current version is focused on identifying security vulnerabilities
such as: remote command execution, pour website isolation (i.e. the user
from website 'A' can see the data from website 'B'), disclosure of
sensitive information (such as usernames/passwords, running processes,
installed services), ability to do a server based port scan, etc..

Eventually the tool should evolve to a "Asp.Net Security Configuration
Tool" where it will also allow the SysAdmins to securely configure their
servers

This project is currently hosted in a Workspace in GotDotNet (
<http://www.gotdotnet.com/> www.gotdotnet.com) and this is the direct
link to the project:

any further help.

We're just sorting out the sourceforge CVS.  I expect that we'll be able to post in the next day or two.  
 
We'll post the following documents:

*	The forward which was peer reveiwed in the spring
*	The whole document which was posted in March of this year
*	The table of contents from the document that we can use as the guideline for the pieces which need to be written.

All documents are being posted in the most basic of html.  This was purposefully done as it will make it easier to convert it into whatever the final "standardized owasp" format will be.

Message-ID: <E1ACTb8-00015b-00@smtp03.mrf.mail.rcn.net>

OK folks, in the CVS under a module called testing are two files. One is a
sign-up list to write up how to test specific issues and the other a very
basic HTML template. 

If you are interested in participating please let Penny Major or myself know
what you would like to write up and we will update the list. First come
first served. As always copyright will be FSF and released under GPL. If you
haven't signed up to write up anything by  Sunday we are going to cull this
list as it is for active participants and this project is now officially
active ;-) All write-ups should be complete within a month and be no more
than 2,500 words. Penny and I will then piece this together with the into
etc and create a first draft. Please ensure the how to test is not just
black box testing. If you aren't sure about code analysis or other ways to
test, mail the list and ask for help.

If you can't or don't do CVS the files are attached.

Lets go !

Message-ID: <1B3E9E3EB7864D4B9FB390365755506902593A@fx1.onx.com>

The original first section of the document has been posted into CVS on sourceforge as well as the full table of contents from the original document.  If you have any problems/questions about how to access the files, please let me know and we'll get you there  (all you need is a browser to pull down the files).

Mark has posted a good list to focus on first.  The intent is to work towards a completed document.  However getting to the completed document may still take a bit of time, so what we'd like to do is to get some of the topics written up and finished off and published as individual articles as they are also being integrated into the document.

I have also posted the full Table Of Contents (TOC) from the working document (dated March, 2003).  If nothing in the signup list appeals to you, take a look at this file and see if there is anything there.  This table of contents is a few months old and as everyone knows, this industry moves so fast that there are probably things that should be added so please post any suggestions for additions/changes.  The TOC is a guideline only and still not written in stone.

I also had an html version of the March 2003 document, but I seem to have misplaced it on my laptop.  I'll post the March document by Sunday.  It has some completed and semi completed sections which may be of use when we are writing.

web view cvs sometimes take a while to update. It is there now and you are
signed up sir ! Thanks.
 
I have also taken transport security. I have a pretty good technique using
OpenSSL to test SSL algorithms, available key lengths and certificates
validity and properties.

Mark,
 
    I didn't see any files on sourceforge.net under the testing project,
though I may not have been in the correct place. If no one has signed up for
'Parameter Manipulation', please mark me down for it.

OK folks, in the CVS under a module called testing are two files. One is a
sign-up list to write up how to test specific issues and the other a very
basic HTML template. 

If you are interested in participating please let Penny Major or myself know
what you would like to write up and we will update the list. First come
first served. As always copyright will be FSF and released under GPL. If you
haven't signed up to write up anything by  Sunday we are going to cull this
list as it is for active participants and this project is now officially
active ;-) All write-ups should be complete within a month and be no more
than 2,500 words. Penny and I will then piece this together with the into
etc and create a first draft. Please ensure the how to test is not just
black box testing. If you aren't sure about code analysis or other ways to
test, mail the list and ask for help.

If you can't or don't do CVS the files are attached.

Lets go !

I'll take a crack at session management then - lots written on
implementing but little on testing.

That encompasses a few other items on the list too, e.g.:
Session ID Predictability     
Token Expiry
Inactivity Timeout 
Activity Timeout
Expiration at Logoff

Sign me up - due date Monday 17th November?

Great stuff Penny. 

We should probably put all of those "How to Test" line items into the
sign-up sheet at some point. I forgot we already had that great list.

You and I can create a master document again that we can cut and paste the
individual write-ups into for the complete deliverable. 

I suggest we use doc for now as it will only be you and I and we can track
changes etc. We can convert if to DOcBook (which is the OWASP standard btw)
when we are done.  

Thanks.

The original first section of the document has been posted into CVS on
sourceforge as well as the full table of contents from the original
document.  If you have any problems/questions about how to access the files,
please let me know and we'll get you there  (all you need is a browser to
pull down the files).

Mark has posted a good list to focus on first.  The intent is to work
towards a completed document.  However getting to the completed document may
still take a bit of time, so what we'd like to do is to get some of the
topics written up and finished off and published as individual articles as
they are also being integrated into the document.

I have also posted the full Table Of Contents (TOC) from the working
document (dated March, 2003).  If nothing in the signup list appeals to you,
take a look at this file and see if there is anything there.  This table of
contents is a few months old and as everyone knows, this industry moves so
fast that there are probably things that should be added so please post any
suggestions for additions/changes.  The TOC is a guideline only and still
not written in stone.

I also had an html version of the March 2003 document, but I seem to have
misplaced it on my laptop.  I'll post the March document by Sunday.  It has
some completed and semi completed sections which may be of use when we are
writing.

Why this? Isn't this an open list. I don't understand why people who 
have contributed in the past would have to be desuscribed.

No its not an open list. Its an open source project. There is a big
difference. 

This list is for people who *are* participating. Participating means
actively writing content. The web site is for people who want to consume.

There are currently lots of people abusing the OWASP name by saying they are
part of it when they never contribute.  That is not fair on the people that
put in a lot of hard work for others to unjustly get the credit. For the
last few weeks I have been talking to CSO's and analysts in America and all
are very aware of OWASP. The work has become VERY credible. The web site is
constantly flashed on plasma screens in security centers in NYC for
instance. I also sat in a Wall Street bank where the CSO tried to tell me he
started OWASP and was the man who was really making it all happen. I had
never heard of him yet alone met him.

Why this? Isn't this an open list. I don't understand why people who have
contributed in the past would have to be desuscribed.

Lol - nice.  Welcome to the band-wagon!

We're really pushing the OWASP name in the UK too - the design and build
side regularly features in our recommendations and client app security
workshops, and we're looking forward to having testing methodologies out
there to 
a/ show compliance with 
and 
b/ recommend clients follow prior to calling in consultancies like
ourselves.

Glyn.

No its not an open list. Its an open source project. There is a big
difference. 

This list is for people who *are* participating. Participating means
actively writing content. The web site is for people who want to
consume.

There are currently lots of people abusing the OWASP name by saying they
are part of it when they never contribute.  That is not fair on the
people that put in a lot of hard work for others to unjustly get the
credit. For the last few weeks I have been talking to CSO's and analysts
in America and all are very aware of OWASP. The work has become VERY
credible. The web site is constantly flashed on plasma screens in
security centers in NYC for instance. I also sat in a Wall Street bank
where the CSO tried to tell me he started OWASP and was the man who was
really making it all happen. I had never heard of him yet alone met him.

There is a file called 'test-march.rtf' in CVS.  This is the big file that was released to the list in March.  It's in rtf format so that most people should be able to read it.  If you have a problem opening the file, let me know and I'll find a format that works for you.
