Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Code review and Testing guides
Message-ID: <f3193c100609070537j3888b21bx520724995b98a68b@mail.gmail.com>

hi,
May I ask If anyone is activley contributing to the Code review or
Testing guides?
If they are may you tell me what you are working on?

I simply wish to see what areas of the guide are free/open for
contribution so no duplication occurs.

Can I ask to keep in mind when contributing that the guide is "A
guide" and try to avoid too much academic or theoretical information
and to focus on the main strands:

What is the vulnerability.
How to test for the vulnerability (Black and White box)
Suggestions on mitigation.

thanks,
Eoin
