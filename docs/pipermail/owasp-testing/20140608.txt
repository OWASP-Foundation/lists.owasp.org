Paros was retired by the dev team in favour of a commercial product
(milescan iirc).  The sourceforge page shows that the code hasn't been
updated in many, many years.

You haven't explained how people working at an open source browser company
that ships free software presents a conflict of interest to working in
volunteer role.

Why are you attacking people who have made positive contributions, why are
you attempting to damage their reputations, and how is this not a violation
of the code of ethics?

You really should take some time to put together a coherent response to
this, because otherwise my next step will be to collect the evidence to
back my concerns, and then file a complaint with the board about your
abusive behaviour.

OWASP Board Members should not be allowed to promote OWASP Project(s)
of their employer without declaring a conflict of interest.
Furthermore they should *not* be allowed to sell out once elected to
the OWASP Board.

Yes, I would be interested to know how Dinis Cruz was not *held* to
account for his malicious and deliberate actions during
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Inquiries/Google_Hacking_Project

Many have tried, all have failed.

If you do I will contact everyone that I know in Mozilla and make them
aware of your failed action against me.

Eoin,

As its creator of the OWASP Code of Ethics it is fairly clear that it
is enforced by selective judgement i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2013-November/012598.html

Thanks also for publishing to a mailing list where I am unable to
defend myself. You never did prosecute Dinis Cruz did you i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2010-July/008705.html

Then again, lets not let a person who was proven beyond a reasonable
doubt to be innocent back on the Leaders List i.e.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Inquiries/Google_Hacking_Project,
much better to invite a known criminal associate that you still
maintain a friendship with instead i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2012-March/006945.html

I look forward to Yvan complaint, don't forget to fabricate the
evidence and witnesses again.
