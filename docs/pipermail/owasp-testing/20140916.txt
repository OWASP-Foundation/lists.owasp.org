Hello,

I'm not sure if it can still be added to the TestingGuide v4, but I have
added a paragraph to the "Testing for logout functionality (OTG-SESS-006)"
page.
I find it important since the weakness described on this wiki page is
present in all ASP.NET versions when using Form Authentication, what is
commonly used in web applications.
Therefore I think it would be good if it could still be added to v4.

For those interested: the weakness in ASP.NET is standard textbook: on
logout, the cookie in the browser is removed, but the cookie value can be
reused to gain access to the authenticated session. See links [1] and [2]
below.

Kind regards,
Lode

Hi Lode,

  Thanks for the contribution, but it is too late for v4. After a short hiatus, work will begin on v5 which will be published in 2016. We look forward to working with you and many others over the next 18 months.

 

For the record, the Testing Guide is undergoing the final touches by the book designer before it is uploaded to Lulu and is released as a published book. Shortly, we will make a formal announce upon its release. For those that have contributed to this project, you should be immensely proud. It represents an evolution of the global standard for security testing of web applications. 

 

Andrew
