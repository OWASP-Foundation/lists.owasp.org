Hi folks,

Any update on when the v4 draft will be available in any form?

Thanks,

Simon

Just so everyone on this list is aware of changes to the web services section...

I contacted Matteo about a month ago letting him know about a new web service testing methodology being released at Black Hat USA by myself, Kevin Johnson and Josh Abraham.  We are going to contribute this methodology back to the OWASP testing guide to be used in version 4.  This revised methodology also includes all attacks mentioned in the WS-attacks.org site as well.  We will be posting the methodology to the list for comment in the next few weeks as we are making some additional tweaks for the white paper.

I'd also like to reach out to Andreas Falkenberg who created WS-Attacks.org about simply porting this content over to the OWASP project wiki as it's already in a wiki format.  That way we don't have to link back to the various attacks that are detailed on his site.  His work is a perfect addition to the testing guide so it would be great to have this integrated in one location.

Hi Tom,
that's perfect!
Yes, we have to discuss on how to create a suitable content for the
testing guide v4 given all your inputs.

Thanks,
Mat

Great news, the ws security was based on some work I did with "Vordel" back in 2007 and needs some updating to be polite ;)

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Risk Modelling - Skill Level
Message-ID: <20110720165654.GB43126@neskaya.eckenfels.net>

Hello,

while working with the OWASP v2 Testing Guide to do some risk modelling for
a few (known) vulnerabilities, I notices that the threat agent section is
based on the concept of "think of a possible group of attackers and describe
the risk that they succeed". However the other way around makes more sense:
"describe the requirements/outcomes of your vulnerability".

For the follwoing 3 metrics, you do not think of a threat agent group to
find out the scores, but you look at the vulnerable system:

Motive:
1 - there is no reward if vulnerability is exploited
9 - high reward 

Opportunity:
0 - full access or expensive required
9 - no access required

Size:
2 - developers
9 - anonymous



But for the "Skill Level" score, you have to think about the skills of the
agents and rate. It should be the other way around "which skills are
required to break in". Consequently "security penetration skills" should be
a low risk rating and "no technical skills" a high one. It does work in both
directions, but the other 3 dimensions looking from the requirements side.

Gruss
Bernd

Bernd,

Great feedback. Would you mind editing the wiki around the OWASP Risk
Rating....

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology

...to account for your feedback?
