Happy New Year all!

Due to hectic work schedules last year on my behalf, the testing  
guide slowed down and for this i apologize.
Im fully recharged and have now scheduled time in my working week to  
get this guide up and running and therefore need the help of a word/ 
XML guru who can help me create the templates for the guide.

Anyone out there?

Hello Dan Et al,
Happy new year to you all also,
Can we leverage the OWAsP Guide template i rather than reinvent the wheel?

regards

Eoin

I agree. I'm getting very close with the NSP template now - it's in  
good shape and looks good when printed. If the testing guide is  
checked into CVS, I could easily update it to be in NSP style as long  
as it's not too long, or else I could do a single chapter so you can  
see how it is used.

thanks,
Andrew
