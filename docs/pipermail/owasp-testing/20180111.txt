Hey Mat, I think I get where you're coming from.

Is there a particular delivery date we're trying to hit?
Can we allow the project o be more free-form? i.e.: Announce the github repo as open for business and get people started on editing/writing (contributing) and publish later when things are actually far enough along?

Whatever form it takes, I know I'm ready to contribute some writing/editing time in the next 6mo.

Hi,
thank you for your follow up.

So, we did some discussion last summer after the OWASP Summit.

Chris created the github project, but at moment we need to set up a team that really wants to help to create a new version.
The problem here is that many people say "I want to contribute" but really a few are able to produce something.

So the question is, may we set up a team of 5-10p that really want to contribute to the project? If you want to jump in, you must be available to contribute in the next 6 months.

Thanks,
Mat

After helping with the Github repo at the Summit, I quickly became
preoccupied with personal matters (new baby!) but I'm in a much better
position to dedicate some time to this now.

I think there's an opportunity for the project to be reasonably free-form
via the GitHub repo like Rick said... the "Issues" are a good place for
discussing ideas and making suggestions IMO. But I like the sound of a core
team too as it will keep things moving.

Ta,
