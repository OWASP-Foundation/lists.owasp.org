<PRE>I think nothing but good can come from getting exactly this dicussion out in
the open.

My experience is that most vulnerabilities are found (far) more quickly by
looking at the source than by any other method.  *BUT* it takes a long time
to get fast.  You need people who are very good programmers (that for
whatever reason don't want to write code everyday) AND they need to know a
lot about security and what the patterns look like in different languages.

Comparing the approaches is a bit of apples and oranges. Penetration testing
generally doesn't search everything and has a lot of false alarms.  If we
did a code review to that level, we could finish in 1/10 of the time. But we
can be far more complete and accurate by checking the code. I'm not against
pentesting -- there are many reasons why code is not available.

There are, of course, some problems that pentesting is faster at -- 
particularly web and app server configuration issues. But there are also
many problems that could NEVER be found with pentesting -- logic problems,
hidden features, dead code, thread safety, and lots more.  This is where we
find the biggest problems by the way.

I disagree with recommending code review during development and pentest
after.  Actually, I think it would be best to do some of each (with internal
people) throughout the lifecycle. Then maybe a third party review to confirm
before deployment.

Smart ass comments inline ;-)

&gt;<i> Absolutely - the nature of consultancy is that you're buying a person's
</I>&gt;<i> skills for a period of time, and better be damn sure they have the skills

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we consider that Risk is a product of both the impact of the issue and
</I>&gt;<i> its exposure, then the data interfaces and particularly the user facing
</I>ones
&gt;<i> are most likely to present the highest risks.
</I>
Smart Ass : Back to Threat modeling! Yipee ! Good point.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've found that while a code review will identify most of the problems
</I>&gt;<i> within an app, it can be a time-intensive (and therefore costly) process,
</I>&gt;<i> and a lot of effort may be focussed on areas that aren't really exposing
</I>the
&gt;<i> application to attack.  Analogies can be drawn with infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> pen-testing - you should be looking for all the problems, but a phased
</I>&gt;<i> approach to find the critically exposed ones is at least a start point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Smart Ass : To play devils advocate for a while I used to think the same.
But it was a factor of the skills I had in my team. Many OWASP'ers and
particulary webappsec'rs are or have been pen testers and not coders. We
used to have people doing app testing at a previous compnay in Atlanta that
werent developers and so there was a slower ramp up and so on. I think Jeff
Williams did some stats on speed of finding bugs by code review and pen
testing. Jeff are those available ?

&gt;<i> Equally, with app testing it is easy to miss serious problems that might
</I>not
&gt;<i> be immediately visible from the 'outside' that would be picked up in a
</I>code
&gt;<i> review.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think both are highly valuable - app testing allows the highest exposed
</I>&gt;<i> problem areas to be found and access to the source code allows a thorough
</I>&gt;<i> analysis.
</I>
Smart ass : I agree with caveats. That is I think we need to take the high
ground and tell people that if you want to find low hanging fruit then pen
testing may help in development but we need to phrase it in a similar way ie
low hanging fruit. Sanctums Crap Scan DE is a great example of how bad
finding bugs using pen testing in development can be for example (although
thats a factor of bad tool and technique IMHO). Its not intuitive for
developers who are used to working in code, may not have a deployed app and
are used to writing unit tests / code coverage.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously I'm coming from an external consultants perspective and getting
</I>&gt;<i> the right ROI balance is essential.  We tend to impart code-review
</I>knowledge
&gt;<i> to the client through workshops with the developers, review their own
</I>&gt;<i> security reviews and supplement that with app-security testing and
</I>targeted
&gt;<i> code review.
</I>
&gt;<i>Smart ass: I hear you. Its also hard when we all know how much money
</I>consultants are making doing web app pen tests. But I think one thing OWASP
has been able to do is to take the high ground irrespective or our own
circumstances and root to the truth and help push the market towards doing
the best thing. This is def true of helping people understand how bad
scanners are with WebGoat for instance!
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should take our usual approach of describing both methods with
</I>&gt;<i> their respective pros and cons, and let the reader decide.  With unlimited
</I>&gt;<i> budget and resource, the whole plan can be followed.  With reduced
</I>resource
&gt;<i> an educated decision can be made about which parts of the guide to
</I>embrace.
&gt;<i>
</I>Smart Ass; This seems very sensible and a great approach (as always from you
IMHO) I do think though we need to be strongly biased towards code review in
development and strongly biased towards pen testing for implementation /
deployment. What do you think ?

&gt;<i> These kinds of debates have raged through all my and your time as a
</I>&gt;<i> Consultants &amp; are likely to carry on a while, I think!
</I>
Smart Ass : Agree 100%.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My 2 cents (having ran pen testing teams on and off for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last 10 years)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pen testing is a time trial at best and a dog and pony show
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the individual testers skills at other times.  I view
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; black box testing of an application as the Turing problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The number of inputs is equal to the number of outputs and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; therefore its highly inefficient. Its like finding a needle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a haystack. Like I said just my opinion and I know not a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; popular one. I have just seen too many apps that one guy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have cleaned up over, but the tester who was assigned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was not as skilled or missed a marker. I am not saying its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useless, far from it but I am saying there are more effective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; techniques to test software security and if you can use them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then you should. If you have the code then those techniques
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are available to you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you have the code (and the guide is aimed at developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not hackers) I think you should use that position to your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advantage (maybe that should be a principle thinking about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it). I can see where pen testing maybe appropriate to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during development if you dont have the code to a component
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (ie using biz objects or cognos or something). Maybe thats
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the way to approach it, describe that there can be a place
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for it and its under these conditions. What do think ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think its also worth reading Gary McGraws article on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difference between software and applications. This helped me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get some clarity on a few things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think ?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think there is a place for black-box testing alongside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code reviews
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; during development too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For example, this can include testing the data interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of discrete
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; application components as they are developed, analysing their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interaction and the traffic flow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This ultimately leads on to deployment testing which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; often focussed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; more on the application's interaction with end users than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; within itself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Our testing typically loops through the intended operation of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; app/component, its actual behaviour, and its impact on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security as a whole.
