<PRE>Absolutely - the nature of consultancy is that you're buying a person's
skills for a period of time, and better be damn sure they have the skills to
sell.  But I think that relates as much to a code review as app testing.

If we consider that Risk is a product of both the impact of the issue and
its exposure, then the data interfaces and particularly the user facing ones
are most likely to present the highest risks.

We've found that while a code review will identify most of the problems
within an app, it can be a time-intensive (and therefore costly) process,
and a lot of effort may be focussed on areas that aren't really exposing the
application to attack.  Analogies can be drawn with infrastructure
pen-testing - you should be looking for all the problems, but a phased
approach to find the critically exposed ones is at least a start point.

Equally, with app testing it is easy to miss serious problems that might not
be immediately visible from the 'outside' that would be picked up in a code
review.

I think both are highly valuable - app testing allows the highest exposed
problem areas to be found and access to the source code allows a thorough
analysis.

Obviously I'm coming from an external consultants perspective and getting
the right ROI balance is essential.  We tend to impart code-review knowledge
to the client through workshops with the developers, review their own
security reviews and supplement that with app-security testing and targeted
code review.

I think we should take our usual approach of describing both methods with
their respective pros and cons, and let the reader decide.  With unlimited
budget and resource, the whole plan can be followed.  With reduced resource
an educated decision can be made about which parts of the guide to embrace.

These kinds of debates have raged through all my and your time as a
Consultants &amp; are likely to carry on a while, I think!

</I>&gt;<i> Chapter 3 - The Testing Framework Explained.doc
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My 2 cents (having ran pen testing teams on and off for the 
</I>&gt;<i> last 10 years)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pen testing is a time trial at best and a dog and pony show 
</I>&gt;<i> of the individual testers skills at other times.  I view 
</I>&gt;<i> black box testing of an application as the Turing problem. 
</I>&gt;<i> The number of inputs is equal to the number of outputs and 
</I>&gt;<i> therefore its highly inefficient. Its like finding a needle 
</I>&gt;<i> in a haystack. Like I said just my opinion and I know not a 
</I>&gt;<i> popular one. I have just seen too many apps that one guy 
</I>&gt;<i> would have cleaned up over, but the tester who was assigned 
</I>&gt;<i> was not as skilled or missed a marker. I am not saying its 
</I>&gt;<i> useless, far from it but I am saying there are more effective 
</I>&gt;<i> techniques to test software security and if you can use them 
</I>&gt;<i> then you should. If you have the code then those techniques 
</I>&gt;<i> are available to you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you have the code (and the guide is aimed at developers 
</I>&gt;<i> not hackers) I think you should use that position to your 
</I>&gt;<i> advantage (maybe that should be a principle thinking about 
</I>&gt;<i> it). I can see where pen testing maybe appropriate to use 
</I>&gt;<i> during development if you dont have the code to a component 
</I>&gt;<i> (ie using biz objects or cognos or something). Maybe thats 
</I>&gt;<i> the way to approach it, describe that there can be a place 
</I>&gt;<i> for it and its under these conditions. What do think ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think its also worth reading Gary McGraws article on the 
</I>&gt;<i> difference between software and applications. This helped me 
</I>&gt;<i> get some clarity on a few things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think there is a place for black-box testing alongside 
</I>&gt;<i> code reviews 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during development too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, this can include testing the data interfaces 
</I>&gt;<i> of discrete 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application components as they are developed, analysing their 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interaction and the traffic flow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This ultimately leads on to deployment testing which is 
</I>&gt;<i> often focussed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more on the application's interaction with end users than 
</I>&gt;<i> interaction 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within itself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our testing typically loops through the intended operation of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; app/component, its actual behaviour, and its impact on 
</I>&gt;<i> security as a whole.
