Subject: [Owasp-testing] Content for v4?
Message-ID: <F6174A7FB2F28248B34B7F3024FF2E600257E656F4@MBX12.bell.corp.bce.ca>

Good morning everyone, I was browsing through v3 this morning and it occurred to me that an issue I've discovered in a number of apps recently isn't really covered by any part of v3 (please correct me if I've somehow simply missed the section).

The issue would fall under Authorization, maybe privilege escalation testing. I usually put it under a heading such as "Enforcement of User Privileges by Elements within the User's Control" when I prepare reports. Basically it boils down to developers hiding things from users or simply marking visible controls/elements as disabled and not performing any check server side for exercise of functionality.

In one example I had a ReadOnly account to an administrative interface where I could "setup" users. Since my account was ReadOnly the "Submit" or "Save" button on the user creation page was set as "Disabled". Using Firebug (or similar means) I simply removed the "Disabled" element on the button and was able to create new users since there was no check performed server side. The HTML in question was something like:

<input id="btnSave" type="submit" disabled="disabled" value="Save" name="btnSave">

I've also encountered similar situations where the following HTML was in play:

<div style="display:none;">

I'd be glad to write up some content for this when production of TG v4 content starts.

Message-ID: <F6174A7FB2F28248B34B7F3024FF2E600257E656F7@MBX12.bell.corp.bce.ca>

Is there an official plan yet for production of v4? Will all the v3 content be copied to a new heading/section of the wiki for editing and addition of new content similar to what we did for v3? 
Also does anyone know what's going on with Common Numbering or Common Requirements? Are we waiting for this to be fleshed out before starting v4 development? I see that a draft has been put up that covers AUTH which is broken into 31 sub-sections, which seems extreme given that the entire TGv3 only has 66 subsections. In the "Roadmap" presentation which is up for v4 there are only about 20 sub-sections listed under Authentication & Authorization. None of this is a bad thing by any means it just kind of suggests that TGv4 is going to be significantly longer than v3. 

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering
The "OWASP Common Requirements Numbering Scheme" tab seems to have authentication as AUTHN while the "DRAFT" tab seems to have it as AUTH, I know it's early but we'll have to ensure we're consistent. Is the testing guide to be the first document to leverage the common requirements scheme? Or are there plans to try to align multiple documents at the same time? (Dev guide, etc) Is there any plan to address additions to or changes to the Common Requirements line-up between official releases of OWASP docs? i.e.: We prepare the TG and it covers anything but then later when preparing an update of the Dev Guide that team notices that we've missed something in the Common Requirements line-up. Will additions to Common Requirements simply result in new headings being added all docs that depend on it with a "To Be Completed" placeholder for content?

Rick,

Thanks for posting this. I respectfully submit that this seems like poor server side enforcement of Access Control/Authorization policy.

Ive seen similar situations where sensitive data was hidden with CSS visibility style, something that I consider to be poor presentation-layer access control policy.

Fair?

I'm with Jim, it does seem to me that they've decided to hide functionality
over implementing a more stringent access control solution. Sad that it
still happens today.

Hi,
it's a definitely Access Control issue.

I think it's more/less covered by:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Bypassing_Authorization_Schema_%28OWASP-AZ-002%29

"Is it possible to access functions and resources that should be accessible 
to a user that holds a different role/privilege? "

I am not sure if there should be a new section, maybe we should just better
specify this specific situation.

Matteo, can you open/start the OWASP testing guide v4 wiki draft for a 
collaborative edit?

Ya that quote seems right on the money, thanks Pavol. 

I'd be glad to author some content for this section, however/wherever it falls in TGv4.
