<PRE>Hey now,

The OWASP Risk rating is just a (very light) mathematical model. You
can change it to suit your preference all you want...

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Boy, sorry that my response on Friday was curt or somehow off-putting, that definitely wasn&#8217;t my intent. I just didn&#8217;t want to revert your change without saying something, perhaps I was too busy or rushed on Friday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From my perspective and that of everyone I talked to on the topic of Skill rating and their part in the Risk Rating Methodology a highly skilled individual should represent greater risk than an unskilled individual as they should find all the same ways to abuse your application as well as others that an unskilled individual may not. While you might be subjected to the attempts of a greater number of unskilled individuals that has no bearing on skill, but rather opportunity and size (which are covered as separate Threat Agent factors <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology#Threat_Agent_Factors">https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology#Threat_Agent_Factors</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for your specific points, I&#8217;ll try to address them:
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;- Thank you for notifying me! I'm always learning and if I don't get feedback, I don't learn.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> 1) As I said I didn&#8217;t want to revert the change without saying something....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;I'm not a hard person to find online and I would've liked to participate in the original discussion (instead of arrive 8 months later).&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Understood, sadly there&#8217;s no way to know who might or might not want to be in on the discussion that&#8217;s why I&#8217;d taken it to the list before making the edit without some kind of input or consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;- Your suggestion &quot;Next time please consult the history of an item before making edits.&quot; seems very impractical, though next time I will post on the mailing list first, would this suffice?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Understood, and yes I believe that would suffice. I made that suggestion only because I knew that the topic of attacker skill was actually delineated in the document history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;- It reads very much like &quot;RTFM&quot; which is not really helpful and very hardly motivating for someone who is hoping to contribute more to OWASP. Something like &quot;Hi, I had to revert your edit as this document is considered deprecated and relevant for historical reasons only. You might want to have a look at CVSSv2 and follow the discussion here: ....&quot; might have been more&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Excellent advice, I probably was a bit hasty on Friday so again I apologize if my response came off the wrong way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;- Mentioning off list discussions does not help.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> 5) I mentioned that simply to illustrate that the change had larger support than simply the half-dozen or dozen people on the list that took part in the discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for following up.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: Are the Risk Rating Wiki Pages Broken?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to revive an old thread, but I just noticed that my edit had been reverted, read through the discussion that sparked it and had some questions and feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some background:
</I>&gt;<i> I am responsible for appsec at a webdev shop that services mostly commercial organisations. We recently introduced OWASP ASVS into our QA cycle to help detect security issues and define security requirements. Good stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that comes with this is reporting. OWASP ASVS 2009 (current 'stable', though 2013 is close to a release) mentions the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I gave a workshop to the teams on using ASVS and mentioned OWASP RRM for use in reporting. RRM is great for us because our reports are mostly used internally or to help the 'risk' discussion with customers when a vuln is in third party software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However a participant noticed that the risk was lower when the required skill level was high, and low when the required skill level was low. This seems very strange as it's almost certain that there are far more low skilled than highly skilled attackers.
</I>&gt;<i> Figured it was a typo especially as the ParadosLabs calculator implements it the other way around: <A HREF="http://paradoslabs.nl/owaspcalc/">http://paradoslabs.nl/owaspcalc/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I fixed a typo and moved on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I got an email that my user page had been updated with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Your modifications to the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your edit has been reversed.
</I>&gt;<i> Next time please consult the history of an item before making edits.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Skilled individuals should produce greater risk than unskilled. See testing guide mailing list archive AUG-2013 for details. Edit was agreed upon by people both on and off list&quot; <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-August/thread.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-August/thread.html</A> <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-September/thread.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-September/thread.html</A> Rick.mitchell (talk) 12:33, 2 May 2014 (CDT)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First I'd like to offer some feedback on the form of this message.
</I>&gt;<i> - Thank you for notifying me! I'm always learning and if I don't get feedback, I don't learn.
</I>&gt;<i> - I'm not a hard person to find online and I would've liked to participate in the original discussion (instead of arrive 8 months later).
</I>&gt;<i> - Your suggestion &quot;Next time please consult the history of an item before making edits.&quot; seems very impractical, though next time I will post on the mailing list first, would this suffice?
</I>&gt;<i> - It reads very much like &quot;RTFM&quot; which is not really helpful and very hardly motivating for someone who is hoping to contribute more to OWASP. Something like &quot;Hi, I had to revert your edit as this document is considered deprecated and relevant for historical reasons only. You might want to have a look at CVSSv2 and follow the discussion here: ....&quot; might have been more
</I>&gt;<i> - Mentioning off list discussions does not help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the content:
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that RMMs fundamental formula is flawed, it's still somewhat useful as a learning tool but I'll have a look at CVSSv2, thanks for the pointer!
</I>&gt;<i> However I still think it's strange that the risk level is higher when you need a highly skilled attacker.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps if there is general consensus that the formula is flawed a 'deprecation banner' could be added warning that it is a legacy document and to have a look at other methodologies like CVSS?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your time!
</I>&gt;<i>
