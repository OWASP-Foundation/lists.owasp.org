<PRE>Hi,

Sorry to revive an old thread, but I just noticed that my edit had been
reverted, read through the discussion that sparked it and had some
questions and feedback.

Some background:
I am responsible for appsec at a webdev shop that services mostly
commercial organisations. We recently introduced OWASP ASVS into our QA
cycle to help detect security issues and define security requirements. Good
stuff.

One thing that comes with this is reporting. OWASP ASVS 2009 (current
'stable', though 2013 is close to a release) mentions the OWASP Risk Rating
Methodology.

So I gave a workshop to the teams on using ASVS and mentioned OWASP RRM for
use in reporting. RRM is great for us because our reports are mostly used
internally or to help the 'risk' discussion with customers when a vuln is
in third party software.

However a participant noticed that the risk was lower when the required
skill level was high, and low when the required skill level was low. This
seems very strange as it's almost certain that there are far more low
skilled than highly skilled attackers.
Figured it was a typo especially as the ParadosLabs calculator implements
it the other way around: <A HREF="http://paradoslabs.nl/owaspcalc/">http://paradoslabs.nl/owaspcalc/</A>

So I fixed a typo and moved on.

Now I got an email that my user page had been updated with:

&quot;Your modifications to the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology

Your edit has been reversed.
Next time please consult the history of an item before making edits.
&quot;Skilled individuals should produce greater risk than unskilled. See
testing guide mailing list archive AUG-2013 for details. Edit was agreed
upon by people both on and off list&quot;

(talk) 12:33, 2 May 2014 (CDT)&quot;

First I'd like to offer some feedback on the form of this message.
- Thank you for notifying me! I'm always learning and if I don't get
feedback, I don't learn.
- I'm not a hard person to find online and I would've liked to participate
in the original discussion (instead of arrive 8 months later).
- Your suggestion &quot;Next time please consult the history of an item before
making edits.&quot; seems very impractical, though next time I will post on the
mailing list first, would this suffice?
- It reads very much like &quot;RTFM&quot; which is not really helpful and very
hardly motivating for someone who is hoping to contribute more to OWASP.
Something like &quot;Hi, I had to revert your edit as this document is
considered deprecated and relevant for historical reasons only. You might
want to have a look at CVSSv2 and follow the discussion here: ....&quot; might
have been more
- Mentioning off list discussions does not help.

On the content:
I agree that RMMs fundamental formula is flawed, it's still somewhat useful
as a learning tool but I'll have a look at CVSSv2, thanks for the pointer!
However I still think it's strange that the risk level is higher when you
need a highly skilled attacker.
Perhaps if there is general consensus that the formula is flawed a
'deprecation banner' could be added warning that it is a legacy document
and to have a look at other methodologies like CVSS?

Thank you for your time!

Cheers,
