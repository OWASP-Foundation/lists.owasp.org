<PRE>Hello,

we also &quot;discussed&quot; that back in 2011 when I mentioned it, that the axes
of the metrics are not aligned for Motive/Opportunity/Size vs. Skill.

<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2011-July/001926.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2011-July/001926.html</A>

Back then I had some login problems to the Wiki so I did not do the
changes, but nobody objected then.

The question is if you model the threat scenario (risk) or the system
resiliance (efford). And you should use the same for all metrics
otherwise its hard to add them into a formular.

Bernd

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to revive an old thread, but I just noticed that my edit had
</I>&gt;<i> been reverted, read through the discussion that sparked it and had
</I>&gt;<i> some questions and feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some background:
</I>&gt;<i> I am responsible for appsec at a webdev shop that services mostly
</I>&gt;<i> commercial organisations. We recently introduced OWASP ASVS into our
</I>&gt;<i> QA cycle to help detect security issues and define security
</I>&gt;<i> requirements. Good stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that comes with this is reporting. OWASP ASVS 2009 (current
</I>&gt;<i> 'stable', though 2013 is close to a release) mentions the OWASP Risk
</I>&gt;<i> Rating Methodology.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I gave a workshop to the teams on using ASVS and mentioned OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> RRM for use in reporting. RRM is great for us because our reports are
</I>&gt;<i> mostly used internally or to help the 'risk' discussion with
</I>&gt;<i> customers when a vuln is in third party software.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However a participant noticed that the risk was lower when the
</I>&gt;<i> required skill level was high, and low when the required skill level
</I>&gt;<i> was low. This seems very strange as it's almost certain that there
</I>&gt;<i> are far more low skilled than highly skilled attackers.
</I>&gt;<i> Figured it was a typo especially as the ParadosLabs calculator
</I>&gt;<i> implements it the other way around: <A HREF="http://paradoslabs.nl/owaspcalc/">http://paradoslabs.nl/owaspcalc/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I fixed a typo and moved on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I got an email that my user page had been updated with:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Your modifications to the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your edit has been reversed.
</I>&gt;<i> Next time please consult the history of an item before making edits.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Skilled individuals should produce greater risk than unskilled. See
</I>&gt;<i> testing guide mailing list archive AUG-2013 for details. Edit was
</I>&gt;<i> agreed upon by people both on and off list&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> (talk) 12:33, 2 May 2014 (CDT)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First I'd like to offer some feedback on the form of this message.
</I>&gt;<i> - Thank you for notifying me! I'm always learning and if I don't get
</I>&gt;<i> feedback, I don't learn.
</I>&gt;<i> - I'm not a hard person to find online and I would've liked to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the original discussion (instead of arrive 8 months
</I>&gt;<i> later).
</I>&gt;<i> - Your suggestion &quot;Next time please consult the history of an item
</I>&gt;<i> before making edits.&quot; seems very impractical, though next time I will
</I>&gt;<i> post on the mailing list first, would this suffice?
</I>&gt;<i> - It reads very much like &quot;RTFM&quot; which is not really helpful and very
</I>&gt;<i> hardly motivating for someone who is hoping to contribute more to
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP. Something like &quot;Hi, I had to revert your edit as this document
</I>&gt;<i> is considered deprecated and relevant for historical reasons only.
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to have a look at CVSSv2 and follow the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> here: ....&quot; might have been more
</I>&gt;<i> - Mentioning off list discussions does not help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the content:
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that RMMs fundamental formula is flawed, it's still somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> useful as a learning tool but I'll have a look at CVSSv2, thanks for
</I>&gt;<i> the pointer! However I still think it's strange that the risk level
</I>&gt;<i> is higher when you need a highly skilled attacker.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps if there is general consensus that the formula is flawed a
</I>&gt;<i> 'deprecation banner' could be added warning that it is a legacy
</I>&gt;<i> document and to have a look at other methodologies like CVSS?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your time!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>
</PRE>
