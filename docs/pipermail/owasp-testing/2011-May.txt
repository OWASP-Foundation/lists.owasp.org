Subject: [Owasp-testing] Proposed OWASP Common Requirements Numbering
	Scheme Format
Message-ID: <F6174A7FB2F28248B34B7F3024FF2E6002596F7DCA@MBX12.bell.corp.bce.ca>

Hey I was reviewing https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering#tab=OWASP_Common_Requirements_Numbering_Scheme this morning and it occurred to me that we shouldn't need the identifier in element one. If we're moving towards a common reference/number there should be no need to indicate a document code as the first element. Especially if the 4th optional element is for legacy identifiers.

Examples from the page:
OCR-AUTHN-01
OCR-AUTHN-02
OCR-AUTHN-02.01
OCR-AUTHN-03
OCR-INPVAL-01
OCR-INPVAL-02

Reference from the page:
    1st Element - Document code (OCR=OWASP Common Requirements Number, ODG=OWASP Development Guide, OTG=OWASP Testing Guide, OCG=OWASP Code Review Guide, others reserved)
    2nd Element - Requirement Area (major)
    3rd Element - Detailed Requirement Identifier (minor with up to one sublevel (e.g., .01, .02)
    4th Element (Optional: DEPRECATED, or # for iterations, or legacy identifiers)

Rick,

Your argument makes a lot of senses. Yea, if it is a common numbering scheme then the document code seems redundant.

Hi Raul, OWASP is an open project. Feel free to sign-up for the wiki (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Special:RequestAccount) and make edits/additions yourself. You should also join the mailing list(s) so that you're in the loop on the latest happenings (https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo). You should also know that things are ramping up to start work on version 4 of the Testing Guide so you should consider editing/adding content for that release.

If you're trying to get info out about your new tool your best bet is likely to post an announcement to the testing list (https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing) and host the tool on sourceforge, googlecode, assembla, github, etc so that people can easily submit bugs/tickets and enhancement requests, get documentation and support, and find the latest version.

Looking at the page you mentioned I don't actually see any reference to ssl_check.sh, maybe you meant ssl_test.sh. Anyway I'm not sure how others feel but at this point I don't think we (or you) should remove any content (or tool references/examples) from v3, if you want to add in alternative checks using your tool that's probably best (in my opinion). 

Rick

Hi Rick,
I've seen your reference on the OWASP Testing Guide for the SSL/TLS section [0], where ssl_check.sh is mentioned.

[0] https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SSL-TLS_%28OWASP-CM-001%29

I plan to publish a tool replacement for ssl_check.sh with some additions, so, who should I send the information about the new tool so that (if OWASP finds it useful) gets posted in [0]?

Thanks,

Hi Rick,
Thanks for the OWASP guidance. I was already on the mailing-list, had
a Wiki account, and saw the v4 related threads this April, so we are
ready to go.

As this has been directly moved to the mailing list, I'm fine with
whatever the community decides:
a) I can replace Example 5 with the new tool (as it is a kind of
improved version of it).
b) I can add Example 6 covering the new tool.

Please, let me know what you prefer (read below to make up your mind).

The tool, called TLSSLed, is a bash script based on sslscan and
openssl, and is inspired by ssl_test.sh (yes, I meant ssl_test.sh and
not ssl_check.sh :( from Example 5 at [0]). IMHO, it doesn't have
enough entity to become a project on itself on one of the open-source
code repositories, so I have put it on our lab page, under "Tools":
http://blog.taddong.com/2011/05/tlssled-v10.html

Comment, suggestions, new tests, and improvements are more than welcomed!

The related blog post covering the tool purpose is available at:

Cheers,
