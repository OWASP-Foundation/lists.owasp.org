<PRE>Great thread and comments

Technically speaking how are you going to store the tool's metadata?

We really need this to be on a 'consumable format' so that we can  
create multiple WIKI views.

I recomend that you use the new 'Template driven WIKI' solution we  
came up at the GPC to manage Owasp projects :)

You should also check Wikipedia for examples on how to present this  
type of information

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Guys
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are a few challenges and proposed solutions as I though on this  
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> the past for OWASP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the time I see a tool list my first question is &quot;which of this  
</I>&gt;<i> ones
</I>&gt;<i> (regardless of license) is best?&quot;, I am a lazy person and wonder  
</I>&gt;<i> this so
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have to spend lots of time with the ones in very early  
</I>&gt;<i> stages or
</I>&gt;<i> with very limited scope. And that question is the one OWASP cannot
</I>&gt;<i> answer without falling in &quot;preferring&quot; (no mater how big, colorful and
</I>&gt;<i> blinking the disclaimer is) an specific tool. To solve this problem I
</I>&gt;<i> recommend you not only list the tool, but link to sites with reviews  
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> that tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I myself had the problem of finding a best tool for a  
</I>&gt;<i> particular job and that was my main reason to start this project.  
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore we just wouldn't be listing the tools in different  
</I>&gt;<i> categories, but we'll also be defining a rating criteria to rate  
</I>&gt;<i> these tools. We are still working on defining the rating criteria  
</I>&gt;<i> and the different possible ways to rate these tools:
</I>&gt;<i>  - We may rate the tools ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i>  - We may seek other users' feedback based on their experiences
</I>&gt;<i>  - and we may also seek other independent reviews, as suggested by  
</I>&gt;<i> you here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that regardless of how useful is one over another we should
</I>&gt;<i> always list them alphabetically or any other &quot;democratic&quot; way without
</I>&gt;<i> taking in consideration those reviews. People will tend to add their
</I>&gt;<i> old, clunky or to-be tool in the list as an intend to catch attention
</I>&gt;<i> and there is nothing you can do to remove them. But at least having
</I>&gt;<i> reviews from other independent sources will put them apart since it is
</I>&gt;<i> fairly hard they have any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we'll be listing both commercial and open source tools, we want  
</I>&gt;<i> to keep this as unbiased as we can, and thus would only be listing  
</I>&gt;<i> the tools in alphabetical order. We'll be listing the tools in  
</I>&gt;<i> different categories as mentioned by you below and any information  
</I>&gt;<i> related to the tools would potentially be listed in a tabular form.  
</I>&gt;<i> So the intended structure would be to have the category as a heading  
</I>&gt;<i> (such as scanners, sniffers, proxy, WAF etc.), then listing all the  
</I>&gt;<i> tools in that category in an alphabetical order along with all the  
</I>&gt;<i> properties of a tool in a tabular form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to not allow the list to be too big and clutter with  
</I>&gt;<i> useless
</I>&gt;<i> or partially working tools or it will be easily dismissed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have decided to include only the release quality webapp related  
</I>&gt;<i> tools in the list. We are also going to take great care that only  
</I>&gt;<i> properly working tools are listed here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mentioning the license is fine but do not use that as a category, use
</I>&gt;<i> the tool type instead (port scanner, sniffer, App Firewall, etc). I  
</I>&gt;<i> mean
</I>&gt;<i> putting that information in a table as the license type that is fine  
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> do not put it as a header before the actual list or you will tend to
</I>&gt;<i> have &quot;Commercial&quot; before &quot;Open Source&quot;. But if the tools are listed
</I>&gt;<i> alphabetically and the license is mentioned in a column then maybe you
</I>&gt;<i> have a good mixture to avoid any appearance of biasing the list (I  
</I>&gt;<i> know
</I>&gt;<i> is not the objective).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having a table is also a good idea as it allows you to show much more
</I>&gt;<i> information like the technologies and platforms supported, the version
</I>&gt;<i> and release level (Alpha, Beta, RC, production) and much more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All this has already been discussed on the project mailing list and  
</I>&gt;<i> would soon appear on Wiki as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One final one, specialize the list, this is, make sure you focus
</I>&gt;<i> exclusively in tools for web applications as there are hundreds of  
</I>&gt;<i> tools
</I>&gt;<i> for network security and you will end up being another security tools
</I>&gt;<i> list on the net.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, you're right, and surely we'll only be discussing about tools  
</I>&gt;<i> that are related to web application security and nothing else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck, I hope it helps,
</I>&gt;<i> Juan C Calderon
