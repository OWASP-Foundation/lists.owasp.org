Hi all

New to list so apologies if there is an errata section I should have checked.

Firstly I really like the guide. I am co-lead on Security Testing Strategy in SAP and we will certainly be using this info to educate our development teams.
I am also liking the ASVS too.

On PDF page 11/224 of OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4.pdf, top right 2nd column:

For example, in June 2002, the US National Institute of Standards
(NIST) published a survey on the cost of insecure software to the US
economy due to inadequate software testing [3]. Interestingly, they
estimate that a better testing infrastructure would save more than a
third of these costs, or about $22 billion a year. More recently, the links
between economics and security have been studied by academic researchers.
See [4] for more information about some of these efforts.

While estimating the cost of insecure software may appear a daunting
task, there has been a significant amount of work in this direction.

I know one has to repeat to make a point, but seems to me there is some duplication here?

Me again

Fascinating read. So I wonder if on PDF page 20/224 there should be a heading?

Last paragraph bottom left:

Threat modeling tools such as threat trees and attack libraries can
be useful to derive the negative test scenarios. A threat tree will
assume a root attack (e.g., attacker might be able to read other users'
messages) and identify different exploits of security controls
(e.g., data validation fails because of a SQL injection vulnerability)
and necessary countermeasures (e.g., implement data validation
and parametrized queries) that could be validated to be effective
in mitigating such attacks.
Deriving Security Test Requirements Through Use and Misuse
Cases
A prerequisite to describing the application functionality is to ..

I suspect "Deriving Security Test Requirement Through Use and Misuse Cases" is a heading?

Sorry to be nit-picky ... honestly I am about to incur the wrath of my Mrs for not getting ready to go out tonight ... this OWASP has got to be a pretty darn good read for me to risk what would make even Kirk's arch enemy look like a <insert most politically correct thing here!>
