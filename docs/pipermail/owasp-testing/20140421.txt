As we?re doing the final bits ?

I?ve reviewed a bunch of articles and have them in a word file (With track changes), didn?t input them into reviewers spreadsheet or the wiki of the project.


In terms of project timelines ? still possible to commit those?



I?ve got reviews with corrections for:
Testing for Sensitive information sent via unencrypted channels (OTG-CRYPST-007)

some additions and changes

Enumerate Infrastructure and Application Admin Interfaces (OTG-CONFIG-005)

minor changes, added tools

Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account (OTG-IDENT-004)

seems to currently have two pages - one 'old' and one 'new content', with 'new content' being unfinished. Have corrections for old.

Testing for cookies attributes (OWASP-SM-002)

minor edits

Testing for Stack Traces (OWASP-IG-XXX)

minor edits and changes, needs to be assigned a category number

Testing for Error Code (OWASP-IG-006)

some additions, minor changes

Testing for HTTP Parameter pollution (OWASP-DV-004)

no changes

Testing for Session puzzling (OTG-SESS-010)

minor changes

Test Session Timeout (OTG-SESS-008)

minor changes

Testing for XPath Injection (OWASP-DV-010)

minor change



the following has an entry which is currently not updated:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weak_or_unenforced_username_policy_%28OWASP-AT-009%29

Testing for Weak or unenforced username  policy (OTG-IDENT-005)

needs to be rewritten



And I suggest per recommendation already in the spreadsheet and after looking at both ? to unite Test Upload of Malicious Files (OTG-BUSLOGIC-016) with Test Upload of Unexpected File Types (OTG-BUSLOGIC-015) should indeed be merged (separating them into malicious file upload and malicious file extension seems redundant), can easily rewrite.

Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account (OTG-IDENT-004)

seems to currently have two pages - one 'old' and one 'new content', with 'new content' being unfinished. Have corrections for old.

Testing for cookies attributes (OWASP-SM-002)

minor edits

Testing for Stack Traces (OWASP-IG-XXX)

minor edits and changes, needs to be assigned a category number

Testing for Error Code (OWASP-IG-006)

some additions, minor changes

Testing for HTTP Parameter pollution (OWASP-DV-004)

no changes

Testing for Session puzzling (OTG-SESS-010)

minor changes

Test Session Timeout (OTG-SESS-008)

minor changes

Testing for XPath Injection (OWASP-DV-010)

minor change



the following has an entry which is currently not updated:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weak_or_unenforced_username_policy_%28OWASP-AT-009%29

Testing for Weak or unenforced username  policy (OTG-IDENT-005)

needs to be rewritten



And I suggest per recommendation already in the spreadsheet and after looking at both ? to unite Test Upload of Malicious Files (OTG-BUSLOGIC-016) with Test Upload of Unexpected File Types (OTG-BUSLOGIC-015) should indeed be merged (separating them into malicious file upload and malicious file extension seems redundant), can easily rewrite.

End of August is when the project should end, but I believe we will finish earlier as Joan and Hugo are on the last bits of the work. Thank you for the feedback on the covers, Matteo. :-)

Ok, brilliant. I defer to Matteo and Andrew. If you have the info, though,
I suggest we add it in before Jane get's started. She is scheduled to start
on Wednesday, FYI. I am just waiting for her confirmation.

Yup, all in a word with track changes, will move to wiki.

One thing that needs to be decided is if it's ok to unify the malicious upload articles (see below). I think we should.

Ok, brilliant. I defer to Matteo and Andrew. If you have the info, though, I suggest we add it in before Jane get's started. She is scheduled to start on Wednesday, FYI. I am just waiting for her confirmation.

Are we still reviewing or can Jane get started on the copy?

I?ve reviewed a bunch of articles and have them in a word file (With track changes), didn?t input them into reviewers spreadsheet or the wiki of the project.

I?ve got reviews with corrections for:
Testing for Sensitive information sent via unencrypted channels (OTG-CRYPST-007)

some additions and changes

Enumerate Infrastructure and Application Admin Interfaces (OTG-CONFIG-005)

minor changes, added tools

Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account (OTG-IDENT-004)

seems to currently have two pages - one 'old' and one 'new content', with 'new content' being unfinished. Have corrections for old.

Testing for cookies attributes (OWASP-SM-002)

minor edits

Testing for Stack Traces (OWASP-IG-XXX)

minor edits and changes, needs to be assigned a category number

Testing for Error Code (OWASP-IG-006)

some additions, minor changes

Testing for HTTP Parameter pollution (OWASP-DV-004)

no changes

Testing for Session puzzling (OTG-SESS-010)

minor changes

Test Session Timeout (OTG-SESS-008)

minor changes

Testing for XPath Injection (OWASP-DV-010)

minor change



the following has an entry which is currently not updated:

Testing for Weak or unenforced username  policy (OTG-IDENT-005)

And I suggest per recommendation already in the spreadsheet and after looking at both ? to unite Test Upload of Malicious Files (OTG-BUSLOGIC-016) with Test Upload of Unexpected File Types (OTG-BUSLOGIC-015) should indeed be merged (separating them into malicious file upload and malicious file extension seems redundant), can easily rewrite.
