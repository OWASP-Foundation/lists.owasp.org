Subject: [Owasp-testing] Buffer overflow for form fields
Message-ID: <f1d166340904020752r5fece1cdi1d0238995eca089a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

          As a developer should i set the charecter limit that can be typed
in a form field , especially when we are registering users in my website. By
not setting the charecter linmit in the form field will it lead to a buffer
overflow attack


Cheers,
Sri

Hello Sri,

Yes you should limit the amount and type of characters for each form
field though server/application side controls and not though and
client side controls such as via javascript.  For example a field for
a telephone number should only allow numbers and allow only the
correct amount of numbers to be inserted.  Just remember any data
coming from a client should be treated as untrusted and verified on
the server side.

Hope this helps,

Kevin

HP yesterday announced HP SWFScan, a free tool to help Flash developers
protect their websites against unintended application security
vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of hackers accessing sensitive data.

Not sure if it is any good. Matteo &  folks @ Minded Security and thoughts
on this one?

Am I the only paranoid bastard who see an astounding similarity between
the logo on the HP page and Minded Security's logo?

The one looks to the right, and the other looks to the left. What's on

That "kind" of logo is very common (https://www.openrce.org/img/logo.png).
I don't think we can blame HP for the choice.

Guys, 

@Eoin:
I'd say that SWFScan is a good decompiler (finally for free) for AS3
but:
- It seems has some issue in decompiling non Flex compiled ActionScript
  2/3 (Example http://www.aflax.org/aflax.zip ) so it's better 
  continue using flare when possible.
- About the "static analysis" feature of SWFScan, it's not perfect as 
  every static analysis tool, so the best is doing it by hand.
  (Example: http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/)
           if(this._config.playerId)
            {
                Security.allowDomain(URLUtil.pageUrl);
            }
  is not alerted..(too complex!)


as a side note, it seems HP is a bit wayward in giving credits about the
underlying theory in Flash issues...but everyone knows, it's quite
common ;)

@Matteo G.P. Flora:
No it's different!... the one from HP has 9 little neurons,
ours has an unnumerable continuous space of Real Number of them :P

@s4tan:
Minded Security is soo ahead that we choose a so nice logo that also in
the past everyone copied us! :P

Cheers,
Stefano

Oops errata corrige, 
it's not jw_player that has
 Security.allowDomain(URLUtil.pageUrl);
but flow player:

I did a little research, the SWFScan tool developer is Prajakta Jagdale (HP formely SPI) his email is prajakta.jadale at hp.com 
Prajakta presented the tool at ShmooCon in Washignton DC back last February
The presentation can be found herein http://www.shmoocon.org/presentations-all.html

Maybe this presentation can be useful to compare it with OWASP SWFIntruder?.. This is what Prajakta claims: "Unfortunately, the capabilities of free tools (SWFIntruder and Flare) have not kept up with new Flash innovations such as the introduction of Flash 9 and 10, ActionScript 3, and Adobe's Flex framework. HP's SWFScan is the first and only free tool to decompile both ActionScript 2 and ActionScript 3 and analyze them for security vulnerabilities" http://www.communities.hp.com/securitysoftware/blogs/spilabs/archive/2009/03/20/exposing-flash-application-vulnerabilities-with-swfscan.aspx
