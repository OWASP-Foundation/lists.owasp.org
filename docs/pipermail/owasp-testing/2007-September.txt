Hi,

http://www.google.com/patents?id=XxB_AAAAEBAJ&dq=cenzic

Above is a link to the cenzic "Fault-injection" patent which may shed some
light on the curent law suit with SPI/HP

Thanks to Adam Muntner for this one

It funny how these things work out, maybe its a nice publicity stunt, Some
people on this list may not of heard of Cenzic prior to this malarkey :)
Other firms, if memory serves me well tried to copyright automated fault
injection also but these assaults fell off my scope.
Its sort of reminds me of the UK CMA which was going to outlaw distribution
of security scanning tools:
