Hi OWASP testers,
  The Testing Guide is one of the most visible OWASP products and used by
testers all over the world. So Matteo and I are seeking contributors for
the update to the Guide. We've cataloged all of the articles that require
writing, how much effort is required and started a list of contributors to
each of these articles (
https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmEhPtZ0cHq3dDc5ZFI0Nm9oSkhzNkNxTzNJbGdPdVE#gid=0
).

Many of the main tasks required for release are now complete, so now we're
focused on a sprint to release. For this we need your help. We're asking
OWASP testers to help us find and revive contributors with the time,
expertise and [most importantly] commitment to complete the writing of
Testing Guide articles. Currently we are seeking contributors for the
Authorization chapter, many Data Validation articles and Cryptography
chapter, but need many more to help write and review other articles. We'll
be conducting a set of sprints to get the revision wrapped up and released
by the *end of 2013*. *The first sprint will be over the month of August*.

One of the key tasks we're seeking to achieve is alignment between the
Testing Guide and other OWASP products, chiefly the Dev Guide. Finding
vulnerabilities is only the halfway point to fixing them. Again, we've
cataloged the Test Guide test cases and aligned them with their equivalents
in the Dev and Code Review Guides. The list is incomplete, but we're making
progress (
https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArkIkLbjWyP6dGhsNkdGLXhKanZqcklmWG41blZ3WWc#gid=0).
So if you've worked on the Dev or Code Review Guide, we could also use your
help.

Sam Groves will be helping us wrangle the contributors (including Mat and
myself) so if you hear from her, please don't ignore her. Even two words in
an email will let everyone know how you're progressing.

So strap in and get ready for Version 4 of the Testing Guide!
