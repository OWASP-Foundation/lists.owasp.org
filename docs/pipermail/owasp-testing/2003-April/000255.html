<PRE>Hi,

I started looking at Chapter 4 in line with Dave's original &quot;release1.zip&quot;
mail of 21/3 &amp; the release deadline of today.  Luckily, you guys are 5 to 8
hours behind, so my 11th hour response is a little earlier in your day!

I agree that chapters 3 and 4 have some crossover - particularly in choosing
the appropriate testing methodology.  

For example, an external audit driven requirement may require specific
targeted areas to be assessed from an operational perspective in order to
attain a certification or licence.  An application assessment driven by a
due-diligence desire may have a much broader scope.

Perhaps Chapter 3 should evolve into 'why assess?' and 'how to assess'
sections.  &quot;How&quot; would clearly be derived from &quot;Why&quot;, and then lead into
&quot;How&quot; in the next chapter - &quot;The OWASP methodology&quot;.

However the structure settles, I have attached updated drafts of the
existing Chapter 4 - The OWASP Methodology.

The intent with this draft is to provide a structure for future debate,
based on the existing guide draft, whilst allowing for plenty of fleshing
out as time goes on.  ** It is destined and expected to change in response
to debate in the list **

For example, the &quot;Application Implementation Review and Testing&quot; is clearly
a broad subject at this stage, and will undoubtedly yield as many
sub-headings as the preceding phases put together.

Comments craved,
Glyn.

PS. Apologies for the multi-format post, but there seem to be a few
different user requirements out there!

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [OWASP-TESTING] nag nag nag - comments please
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agree. I think what is being suggested about ensuring we keep 
</I>&gt;<i> in sync makes a lot of sense and ensuring testing focuses on 
</I>&gt;<i> testing also seems smart. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Overall I think the aim wasn't to prescribe testing as black 
</I>&gt;<i> box or white box or whatever, it was more to describe each 
</I>&gt;<i> discipline that you might consider, highlight the pros and 
</I>&gt;<i> cons of each, describe when each may be appropriate, and 
</I>&gt;<i> describe a process and technique proceedures to undertake 
</I>&gt;<i> each and them. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does that seem sensible and accurate? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given its much easier to bite off small chunks at a time I 
</I>&gt;<i> would suggest we focus on those first four chapters for now. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is what I think the intent of them was.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter 1 - Introduction - obvious. Use the Guide format. 
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter 2 - What is a Web Application or Web Service ? - set 
</I>&gt;<i> the scene and make the book complete for someone who is 
</I>&gt;<i> reading it in isolation or needs the chapter for context. 
</I>&gt;<i> Refer to the OWASP Guide as the definitive reference. Pull 
</I>&gt;<i> content directly from the Guide.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So that leaves US with the first two REAL chapters for this 
</I>&gt;<i> project of Why Test and The OWASP Testing Methodology. I 
</I>&gt;<i> think 3 is relatively easy and 4 will see hot debate ;-) And 
</I>&gt;<i> rightly so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter 3 - Why Test ? - Objective: discuss the reasons why 
</I>&gt;<i> you would want to test. Jeremy's point is well taken, there 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe more. Perhaps create a Chapter 3 document on its own 
</I>&gt;<i> and start iterating improvements ? Dave, are you the keeper 
</I>&gt;<i> for any updates ? If we can put it into DocBook chapter by 
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter and in CVS it will be a whole lot easier. I know I go 
</I>&gt;<i> from DocBook hater to lover but it really is working well for 
</I>&gt;<i> the Guide project now ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter 4 - Objective to define a structured methodology that 
</I>&gt;<i> could be adopted for how to decide, Why, When, What and How 
</I>&gt;<i> to test your target site / applications. Now I have written 
</I>&gt;<i> that I have convinced myself Chapter 3 is a sub section of 
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter 4. What struck me when I re-read the heading and 
</I>&gt;<i> subheadings was we kinda prescribed a right way and a wrong 
</I>&gt;<i> way. I think thats the Phase word that indicates 
</I>&gt;<i> serialization. I think its more a case of here are the things 
</I>&gt;<i> you should consider and heres some tips that can help you 
</I>&gt;<i> arrive about your answer. Thats not to say some things aren't 
</I>&gt;<i> logically before others. Clearly a plan is a good idea and 
</I>&gt;<i> theres no point in creating  that afterwards right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways Dave, what do you day about chapter by chapter. I am 
</I>&gt;<i> sure we can all knock out the Methodology in a few weeks of 
</I>&gt;<i> online debate ?
</I>&gt;<i>
