Just Fine.

Can we include screenshots in the documentation?

thing is no public domain names in screen shots.....

screenshots are important, and yes, we have to make sure there are no  
public domain names :0)

I have an incomplete draft of the threat modelling section.  If anyone's 
interested in reviewing I'll happily send you a copy.

During my research I've found quite a few similar, but not identical ways of 
doing threat models so I'm also trying to classify each one I find. I expect 
someone else involved in OWASP has far more experience than I do in threat 
modelling - if they're willing to add their comments and feedback I'd be 
very grateful :-)

I'll remember to add diagrams and I will remember to exclude screenshots of 
commercial products, etc.

Send it along. I was involved in the review of the MS methodology and am
involved in a project to create a more open standardized version.

There is an RFC for this, RFC 2606. All URLs should be example. 
{com,.net,.org} as they are reserved for this exact purpose.

Lastly, please feel free to use the Guide 2.0 for content and ideas.  
I'm concentrating the Guide 2.0 on code reviews, not pen testing, but  
there is a great deal of overlap.

thanks,
Andrew

If Guide 2.0 is concentrating on code reviews, shall i continue doing a code 
review document as a splinter of the Testing guide or go back to integrating 
it as part of the Testing gude?

My code review doc focuses on:

.NET and Java Best practice mitigating against the common vulns. providing 
code examples.
Code review managment and pitfalls in the process.
How to actually perform a code review.
Framework issues.

Personally, they should be a shared chapter between the two projects  
as they should be the same. Code reviews are absolutely in scope for  
testing. I believe they are far more valuable than normal security  
testing performed by most projects (such as zero knowledge pen tests  
- a complete WAFTAM).

Message-ID: <138E4EAF-6936-44D9-8341-A04460E6B05B@greebo.net>

Hi there,

I am happy to announce that the Guide 2.0 has been finished. It is  
rendering now on my PC. It is 278 pages long and will weigh in around  
2 MB once it has finished being fully tagged by Acrobat in an hour or  
so's time.

The upload will be on SourceForge within the hour, but please don't  
make any public noises as yet. Feel free to tell friends who might be  
interested in getting an early copy, but please no Slashdot  
submissions or similar until Wednesday morning. If there is to be  
press (and I hope there is), can those efforts be coordinated by   
Jeff Williams rather than everyone making  independent efforts. Jeff  
- could you get a PR together for Wednesday morning?

I have incorporated as many corrections as is possible, but I am  
certain that there are bugs and issues to be found. These will be  
fixed in 2.0.1 in a few week's time taking into account some time for  
people to digest and peer review the content. Version 2.1 will be  
even better as we work with No Starch Press who are allocating us an  
actual editor! With some luck, the NSP book will be out in November  
or December. I will keep the Guide list informed of our progress with  
No Starch.

I wish to thank everyone who has helped make the Guide 2.0 a reality,  
including early authors who may not necessarily be with us today.

thanks,
Andrew
