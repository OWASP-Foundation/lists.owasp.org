Hello,

I need hints here. How do I analyze key file? This key file is being
used by web application in authentication. The file has .key extension
and it's not in plain text format.

Thanks!

News Release/Call For Contributors
OWASP Development Guide Project begins work on next Guide version
The Guide is a manual for designing, developing, and deploying secure web applications

OWASP Development Guide Project
MCLEAN
February 10, 2010

MCLEAN, Feb. 10 /OWASP Development Guide Project<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project>/ -- After many months of planning and preparation, the OWASP Development Guide project announced today that it is ready to begin work on the next revision of the Guide, and that that the project is looking for volunteers to do the work, both individuals and organizations.

The OWASP Development Guide is aimed at architects, developers, consultants and auditors and is a comprehensive manual for designing, developing and deploying secure web applications. The original OWASP Development Guide has become a staple diet for many web security professionals. Since 2002, the initial version was downloaded over 2 million times. Today, the Development Guide is referenced by many leading government, financial, and corporate standards and is the Gold standard for Web Application and Web Service security.

The next version of the OWASP Development Guide will be in effect the detailed design guide for the requirements of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), which can be found here: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS. Key features of the next Guide will include use of the new OWASP common numbering scheme. The new numbering scheme will be common across OWASP Guides and References, more information can be found here: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering. Additional key features will be the inclusion of worksheets and checklists, such as the sample input validation worksheet which can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/WebAppSecDesignGuide_D5_2_1_1

For more information, and for more information if you are interested in volunteering, please see: http://owasp-development-guide.googlecode.com/files/development-guide-contributing.pdf  Please forward this email as you think appropriate. Got buddies and want to work on a section or two as a team? Professional project management will be a key feature of the next release of the Guide and can help to facilitate such arrangements. Here is what the work streams will look like: http://owasp-development-guide.googlecode.com/files/guide-org-chart.pdf. And, the Guide project is always on the lookout for volunteers. If you think you might have availability in the future, please do reach out at that time. For more information, email the OWASP Development Guide project manager Mike Boberski at mike.boberski at owasp.org<mailto:mike.boberski at owasp.org>.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Session timeout failure - What ref. number?
Message-ID: <B3ACBF9400D0FD479F321DAD89EAB52802CD131F@sedc1mail1.omegapoint.se>

 I came across a failure to properly timeout a session. The session times out and I am re-directed to the login page, but by pressing "back" on the browser got me into the application again which still thought that I was logged in.

My question is what reference number that would be in OWASP testing guide. I've been browsing through the guide but haven't been able to pin-point the reference number as of yet.

Perhaps it belongs under OWASP-SM-001, but I am not sure.

Please advice.

Best regards
Michael Boman

Hi Michael,
you are right. We described the session expiration in OWASP-SM-001 and
OWASP-SM-002.
The first one says to check if the session expires in a reasonable
time submitting the same cookie in different time frames; the second
says to check inside the cookie attributes when the application
response with a Set-cookie directive if there is a setting for date of
expiration.

In your case, maybe you are describing another issue: TESTING FOR
LOGOUT AND BROWSER CACHE MANAGEMENT (OWASP-AT-007).
It seems that the application or maybe a client script redirect you
automatically on the login page after a time-out. The problem here is
that the application does not invalidate your session server side
after a forced logout. Try to investigate what interesting information
are sent on the HTTP requests/responses during the forced logout and
what happen if you click on logout button (if any). Is that case more
suitable?

Thanks,
Mat

I'd classify that as session fixation (OWASP-SM-003). Just like a new session identifier should be assigned once a user has successfully authenticated a session identifier should be invalidated if they logout or are forced (via timeout etc) to logout.

Michael, 

I'd agree with your conclusion.  SM-001 is the best fit from a purely
session management perspective. 

You might also look at AT-007 "Testing for Logout and Browser Cache
Management"
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Logout_and_Browser_Cache_Management_%28OWASP-AT-007%29

This may also apply since the app likely should be removing your
authentication (that is logging you out) when the session has expired.

Have you determined what is causing the HTTP 302 (Redirect)?  Typically,
this is caused server side on the the request that occurs right after
session max time.   Please tell me its not some JavaScript code
implementing a timer that exists per page. ;)

Also, the method to redirect is occasionally vulnerable to attacks.
Something to look at anyway.

Hope that helps.

As Matt I hope it is not just JavaScript redirecting the user 

If you also have to refresh the page or are presented with a "you have
to resend post information" message then you might be facing an issue
with credentials being cached at browser, in that case you have to
implement a redirect-after-post to make the browser "forget" the
credentials

Juan Carlos
