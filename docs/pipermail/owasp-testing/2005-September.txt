As Alberto has already pointed out some weeks ago, some paragraph are
overlapping.
So I suggest the paragraph 2.2 "Weak Session Tokens" should have a
reference to the paragraph "Cookie Manipulating" in chapter "Parameter
Manipulation".

I think also the paragraphs:
? Session token transport security and reuse of session tokens from
HTTP to HTTPS []
? Session hijacking [ ]
? Session replay [ ]
? Session manipulation [ ]
? Inactivity timeout [ ]
? Activity timeout [ ]
? Expiration at logoff [ ]
? Session token expiry
located in the "Authentication" chapter should do the same.

What do you think?
Mat

P.s: I resend to you the paragraph "Cookie Manipulating", in zip format.

hi all,

Thanks to those who have already sent in their sections, im currently

Obviously this means ill have 10 hours to spend whilst in transit, so  
will start building up the document

For those who have still yet to hand in their sections, could you let

Hi Larry,
regarding the Java example and memory usage,

If the Java virtual machine JVM uses switches as follows this will limit
the memory usage

-Xmx10m sets the maximum heap sixe in megabytes (10MB in this example)
-Xoss300k seys the maximum stack size in 1024 chunks -Xss64k sets the
max native stack size for any thread in multiples of 1024.

these can all be seen by typing "Java -X" at cmd line

Just thought you would like to know.

Good question.  I'm tending to think 'no', since the SQL injection is
really its own fully distinct attack and problem.  There would seemingly
be a lot of possible ones such as 'arbitrary file upload that can
overwrite a web file on the system' or 'command execution that could
remove the web pages or shut down the web server' that might also come
in scope... But I think at those points, there are bigger problems.  

However, by this same logic, one could put the Buffer Overflow DoS into
that same type of category.  So I'm willing to listen to opinions from
others on this... Do we want to include a catch-all of other possible
ways someone could make the application unavailable if they used other
attacks to compromise something in the application, like those we
discussed here?

Would removal/corruption/encryption of the authentication table in a DB

I was really looking forward to taking the "forgotten password" section
as it's one my favorites during testing.
However, it's already taken.

If it isn't - I'd want to do it.

Yes, I think that's best. Notice that a buffer overflow might not 
inmediately lead to code execution but can lead to a DoS (consider an 
application running on an obscure processor or a known vulnerability 
with no exploit code: you can find a buffer overflow in an obscure 
application (by simpkly feeding long parameter values) but he might 
not be able to debug the application in place in order to determine 
how to setup the buffer overflow to execute code.

I think the difference might be that the DoS in a Buffer Overflow comes
before the "real" exploit of command execution.  I've covered it in the
existing chapter I've written.  But in the case of something like
"dropping all the tables from the database", that can only happen once
you're successfully exploiting SQL Injection attacks at will.  For
example, will the Authentication section have a part that notes you can
use SQL injection to add a fake account to accounts table in the
database?  Will an authorization section note that you can use SQL
injection to add permissions to the permission table?  The list sorta
goes on.  Once you have a working remote exploit such as command

Yes, I think that's best. Notice that a buffer overflow might not
inmediately lead to code execution but can lead to a DoS (consider an
application running on an obscure processor or a known vulnerability
with no exploit code: you can find a buffer overflow in an obscure
application (by simpkly feeding long parameter values) but he might not
be able to debug the application in place in order to determine how to
setup the buffer overflow to execute code.

Larry,

I agree on what you're saying, and in fact it might not be beneficial to
modify the whole document.
However, while causing a DoS might be pointless in the scope of testing,
citing DoS as a possible outcome of an attack might have some value, if not
for the reason that you might cause a DoS yourself when testing.
It is true that this is more likely with some vectors (e.g., malfunctioning
BOFs) than others, where you have to do it purposefully. SQL injection
probably is of the latter kind; though, if you can play with UPDATE commands
you can do quite some harm and one could argue that if you don't know the
internal semantics you might inadvertently cause unintended damage and
consequently DoS.
Hope it doesn't appear too confusing...

I think the difference might be that the DoS in a Buffer Overflow comes
before the "real" exploit of command execution.  I've covered it in the
existing chapter I've written.  But in the case of something like
"dropping all the tables from the database", that can only happen once
you're successfully exploiting SQL Injection attacks at will.  For
example, will the Authentication section have a part that notes you can
use SQL injection to add a fake account to accounts table in the
database?  Will an authorization section note that you can use SQL
injection to add permissions to the permission table?  The list sorta
goes on.  Once you have a working remote exploit such as command
execution or SQL injection stuff, there are a huge number of possible
vectors.  I don't know that I'm convinced that it's wise to try and put
stuff into every other security chapter that addresses things that
people using other exploits could do after they've owned the box.  After

*nod* I agree with you.  The tricky part is coming up with a
definitional level of what should make the cut and what shouldn't.  Like
I mentioned, I fully agree Buffer Overflow based DoS should be in there
(it is now) because you're going to find the DoS before it eventually
becomes a command execution problem.  I guess I'll take a stab at
writing up a kind of catch-all paragraph or two that mentions DoS
possibilities that can occur while attempting to use other exploits such
as SQL Injection or various OS command execution exploits.  Then we can
take it from there with that as a starting point, and figure out if we
need more coverage, etc.

Agreed. I was exactly thinking about this too. I remember a case when 
a bad place '-- in a parameter caused an update script to run
"update foo SET columna=''-- where columnb='something'" instead of 
just "update foo SET columna='parameter" where columnb='something'". 
That was a blind SQL injection test, something that an automated 
application might do inadvertently and could have grave DoS 
consequences for the application itself.

So, it's not something that can happen when you go and say "ok, I have 
SQL injection here, I can clear up all tables or drop the database 
itself" but also something that can happen when you are in the 
investigation phase and testing the application.

Maybe the above example would be more a warning to (blind pen-) 
testers than something that should appear explicitly in the DoS 
section. I don't know...

Javier

Good point Larry.
The fact of Dropping a table is after the establishment of SQL injection and 
hence further damage.
Best to stay away from this otherwise we shall be repeating ourselves ad

I am at the beginning of writing my four year old outline into a  
secure solutions architecture book for Addison Wesley. However, this  
is a long way away. :)

In the meantime, I suggest you look at the usual suspects of today's  
fads, like FDD, TDD, XP / RUP / agile programming in general.

It is my current experience on a very very large project that the old  
waterfall model (or even partial hybrid agile/waterfalls) with  
Solution Architectures/HLD/DDD etc eventually work, but very very  
slowly and produce a mountain of useless paper (he says, guilty of  
producing at least some of this mountain). The waterfall model is  
extremely inefficient - double the time and resource budget over  
initial estimates, and cut delivered features by ~ 25% and that's far  
more realistic for a 1.0 release.

What *doesn't* work is writing a spec and out tasking the spec to be  
developed externally. I have *never* seen this work, and the half  
baked results have *always* been insecure. This is because

a) the spec is hard and fast and this is what the out tasker will  
cost and deliver
b) western writers do not know how to write specs properly ("do as I  
imagined, not as I wrote")
c) the out-tasker's job is not to produce your imagined deliverable,  
but to make money on a fixed price, fixed feature usually badly  
written spec

It is safe to use out taskers ... as long as you use an agile process  
with them, so they're there for the ride and reap the benefits of  
delivering good quality milestones on time and take pain for bad  
security / late deliverables / poor results.

In all cases, give them the OWASP Guide and buy and supply them with  
copies of Writing Secure Code (Howard & LeBlanc) to develop against -  
this will reduce the amount of re-work they will have to do. The cost  
of the book for each dev is far, far cheaper than re-working even one  
security blemish.

thanks,
Andrew

Yes, I do. It works well for technical issues in code developed in  
house, particularly useful at developing a TODO list for future  
fixes. It is not perfect - it takes longer than necessary to work out  
when there are many issues to work through, but I haven't yet come  
across a way as good as STRIDE / DREAD which is *acceptable* to the  
business types who have to fund remediation work as they can work the  
sums just like Excel and for some reason they tend to believe the  
subjective bits of DREAD a bit more than simply putting in "High"  
"Medium" or "Low" based upon one's experience.

However, it is *not* out of the box a business risk modelling tool -  
if you need to factor that in, DREAD is missing the average loss  
expectancy component.

You could change D = damage to be the ALE, and calculate the ALE as  
per normal, with

ARO = Annualized Rate of Occurrence
SLE = Single Loss Expectancy

ARO x SLE = ALE

ARO is very subjective and impossible to garner realistic numbers or  
statistics. I'm not saying make it up, but you might have to. Costing  
the SLE is next to impossible unless you have had that event happen  
in the past. There are many good references on how to incorporate the  
actual cost of a SLE. Make sure you use "opportunity cost" and future  
revenue losses as well - if you lose thousands of people days  
organization wide due to a virus or no backups, that's a real hit to  
the bottom line *and* future activities they were working on.

However, it is my experience, there is a great deal of confusion  
about if the ARO refers to the organization, or globally. For  
example, an organization will receive hundreds if not hundreds of  
thousands of viruses per year. It's easy to use this as the ARO and  
no one will disagree. But what about more esoteric items, such as  
phishing or DDoS attacks. Until you've lost money, you could easily  
set ARO to zero. Yet, there are millions of phishing victims and  
thousands of DDoS victims every year, and once a phishing or DDoS  
attack starts against you, they rarely if ever stop.

That's why we rate the ARO of a building fire in any particular  
building as a 1 in 10 year event as it is averaged out over a bunch  
of buildings, even if you don't own or occupy more than one. You have  
to have fire exits and evacuation plans ... even if you never intend  
to have a fire. Unless a risk is unique to the organization, I always  
take the global ARO, not the local / organization ARO.

Communicating this successfully to business types is very very hard.

thanks
Andrew

Daniel,

you really should try using the CVS tree at Sourceforge - it makes it  
much easier to work with and people aren't reliant on you. I am glad  
I've done this for the Guide now and it makes it trivial to farm out  
work.

If you need a master document template, I have it for the Guide. Once  
you exceed about 160 pages, it's highly likely that Word will corrupt  
itself - I had this happen twice whilst working on the Guide. The  
only solution is master documents.
