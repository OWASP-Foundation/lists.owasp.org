Hi everyone,

Attached is my contribution to the OWASP testing manual (as you all
know, today is the deadlines for assigned contributions). I'm not all
too happy with it as, when writing it, I was not able to find really
good tests for each of the sections and the section is more biased
towards "review" (or audit) than "testing".

I will wait to see the other contributions to this part before I go
ahead and write a few of the mini-sections that remain from what I
asked to be assigned (File-system permissions, Process permissions,
and HTML and hidden form fields) since, again, the only way I can make
myself to write about this is from an auditors perspective.

Maybe by reading other's work and seeing how they tackle other similar
topics I might "see the light" on how I should cover these, and also
what kind of technical tests (not reviews) I should introduce.

Regards

Javier


PS: I didn't want these part to be a detailed configuration guide on
setting up or reviewing Apache or IIS configuration, as there is
already good content out there. If you believe it is too generic
please say so and I will try to reuse some (unpublished) I wrote on
that topic in the past.

The timeline sent was:

August 1st - first version of the volunteered sections
[ peer review of sections, detection of who is not active, decission 

to offer up sections to others if people are overloaded, etc ]

August 15th - final version of the sections
[ peer review of sections, editorial changes ]

So every volunteer should provide a first version of their section by 
yesterday. IIRC.

Daniel,

I had volunteered to do the J2EE bit and will be able to send in my
draft by end of this week.

I would like to know who would be reviewing the J2EE bit?

Warm Regards,
Meghna

I'm almost done with the buffer overflow sections I had volunteered
for. Just needed to do some work on the heap overflows part.

I am also targeting end of this week.

:-)

I've checked the content Dafydd Stuttard developed last time (back in 
november 2003) for the testing guide which I will be reusing for my 
section ("Old, Backup and Unreferenced Files", and "Sample and default 
files").

In any case, reviewing the OWASP Guide, doesn't it overlap quite a lot 
with the testing guide? People might want to review what the sections 
in the Guide related to their sections currently speak of.

Regards

Javier

Mauro, good job. Here are some quick comments. 
 
SSL
 
Shameless plug for SSL 
http://www.foundstone.com/resources/proddesc/ssldigger.htm
Designed to exactly what you describe (and more)
Key lengths are tied to cipher suites
You need to also comment on key exchange protocols (strong cipher with
ADH is not a good idea !)
 
Certs
 
You should not use a regular browser to check certificates. Many of the
API's used by the .NET framework do not adequately check CRL's and CRL
paths. You have to hand the full bang of certs you have etc. Look at API
doc for example. Many browser settings will determine how the relevant
API is invoked. This means certs can be invalid but still report as
being valid in some cases dependent on browser config. They also use the
local clock to determine date time matching so if your local clock is
not accurate (i.e. set forward by 3 months) you will not get a true
indication of the cert has expired. There are also fields you need to
look for including usage (I often see key signing certs on SSL servers).
You should also explicitly ensure people don't think certs are web
server certs. JSSE, MSCAPI etc all have classes where SSL is
instantiated from the app itself. This is especially important in web
services where you are not relying on infrastructure to provide the
security. 
 
PS for shits and giggles https://www.verisign.net
 
Backup files - pet hate. Who cares if there is a sample file installed
UNLESS it has a vulnerability. Needs to be made clear to stop the scare
mongerers ;-) Also I think its important to explain the 404 issues and
why Nikto and tools like it usually report so many false positives. 
 
WebDav section needs work but sadly no time to comment now.

With respect to the "Old, backup and unrefereced (sic) files"  I want 
to point out (again) that Dafydd Stuttard wrote an excellent text on 
this matter that could be reused, please check the CVS or the file 
attached.

As for the text here's some personal recommendations for improvement:

Unreferenced application files are not only dangerous because they 
provide you with internal source code but because they might be 
vulnerable! Imagine the case of a web administrator taking a file that 
has an SQL injection, making a backup copy of it, editing it to remove 
the SQL injection present and leaving. If he forgets to remove the 
backup file _And_ the backup file's extension will be executed by the 
webserver (think: original: login.jsp, backup: login.old.jsp) then you 
might think you are safe when you are actually just as vulnerable as 
before (just that people don't know that the file exists).

You also fail to mention files that do not belong in the web server 
but are typically generated by upload tools (think WS_FTP.log files). 
These files are "unreferenced" in the sense that they should not be 
there, and contain sensitive information (like the user that ftp's in 
the web server) that might be valuable to the user.

Finally, many people are unaware or dimiss the problems with these 
files because they think that the default index.html pages prevents 
all of them from being seen (security through obscurity), they say 
"why care? only an internal user with knowledge can know about them?" 
and then the next web server security bugs comes around and makes all 
the directories browsable because a module fails to load the default 
index .{asp,html} page when fed malicious input, or the web server is 
not properly configured and serves directory listings (the "I expected 
everyone to go through the redirection that sends you to 
"/login/login.asp", I thought nobody could access "/login/" directly 
and get a listing of the directory there!)


Some White box strategies for detecting files (which I believe are 
easier to implement and will produces less FP than the scripted 
methods you suggest)

- Look for files who have not been accessed in a long time, they might 
be backup or unreferenced file. Rationale: If this is a web server, 
most of the files will have their "last access" timestamp modified 
everytime the web server reads them in to provide them to an end-user 
or run them through an application engine. If a file has not been 
accessed in, say, a year. It should be analysed. Of course, you need 
to be using a filesystem that stores access times (most modern 
filesystem will do)

- Correlate logs of the web server with actual files. Rationale: you 
can go through the web server access logs and retrieve the list of 
files requested by clients and then compare that with the actual files 
in the server. Those files that are _not_ on web server logs (if logs 
go back sufficient time) are potential unreferenced files

In Black Box testing you are missing some useful inputs sources:

- Archive.org, better than google since it will _not_ timeout the 
pages after time so you can actually see the old files that were in 
the web server 3 years ago.

- robots.txt files. Some people believe they can "hide" files from 
there using that file, they don't think that the robots.txt file is 
only honored by, yes, robots.

- HTML comments. Either of active content (think server side includes 
which have been disabled) or forms that have changed their action and 
maintain (in a comment) the previous action CGI used.

I would suggest you add these, as well as review the attached text 
(the one I mentioned before) and merge many of its suggestions and 
comments in your text.

Regards

Javier

It does not need to have a vulnerability to be a security issue. Think 
  of sensitive information being disclosed that can be used to attack 
other elements of the web server architecture (sample: valid ftp users 
in log files) or of vulnerable code that has been backup in the same 
directory before patching it.

Most tools (Nikto and Nessus) have tools to _try_ to detect these 404 
issues. They are not perfect and that's why they have both false 
positivies and false negatives. In any case, the problem with 
unreferenced files is akin to brute force attacks, there's just too 
many ways to name backup files and you will not pick all of them. It's 
plain better to just browse the web server directory and compare 
either with web server logs, with a web server map generated with a 
crawler or analysing the last access timestamps.

It's even better if you can do this through a remote code execution 
through another vulnerability (happened recently to me in an pen-test) 
or if you can retrieve the list of files in the server through an 
different server (compromise an unsecure ftp server that was at some 
point used to upload files to the web server and check its logs).

In terms of unlinked files...just a quick comment - the BackEnd miner
inside of Wikto (http://www.sensepost.com/research/wikto) does a splendid
job of finding directories and files within these directories. It also
works nicely with friendly 404 (or 302s or whatever) etc etc..

Dont know if this is relevant or if you mentioned it in the doc...or if
there is a seperate tool section..

my 2c,
Roelof

PS: we have recently released a couple of other web application testing
tools - whoever is writiing section on app testing (input validation,
brute forcing, state tracking) - be nice if you speak to me (when looking
at testing tools).

If it doesn't have a vulnerability why is it a security issue ? If it
reveals information then that's a vulnerability.

Most tools (Nikto and Nessus) have tools to _try_ to detect these 404
issues. They are not perfect and that's why they have both false
positivies and false negatives. In any case, the problem with
unreferenced files is akin to brute force attacks, there's just too many

Im in the same camp on this one, if there is no DIRECT security risk,  
then its not a security related issue.
Ive seen too many "conslutancies" who make a css.bak file high risk

It is true that from an _application_ assessment standpoint if a backup
file doesn't have a vulnerability or leak information then it isn't an
issue.

However from a _process_ assessment standpoint the practice of "version
control by .bak file" is terrible and can have disastrous security
implications.

Any consultancy that lists a css.bak file as a HIGH risk vulnerability
is irresponsible, but not coaching organizations to use proper version
control and to remove unneeded files from their deployments is also
irresponsible.  I don't know what everyone else's experience has been
but we have found that developer education is as much as part of most of
our application assessment engagements as actually finding
vulnerabilities.

Thanks,


Dan

and which i agree, but we all have to realize what this guide is  
focusing on and thats web application assessments. 80% of the work im  
doing now relates to developer training and awareness and OWASP does  
have other projects which talk about this, but we have to stick to  
what is checked for in a web application assessment only

Actually that last statement is not always true. It actually depends 
on the company's security policy. In CVE terminology, 
information-disclosing stuff is considered "exposures", see 
http://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html

In any case, it seems we agree on this issue. If there's some value to 
what you find through unreferenced files you should note it. Notice, 
however, that the value of the information revealed might not be 
associated with the application service itself but might impact in 
other services unrelated to it. That's what I wanted to stress out.

Javier

Hey all,
 
Following is the Default User Accounts and Blank Passwords section.
I will be releasing the rest once I'm done finalizing and touch-uping.
The tools section is empty in this one, and will probably be empty on
most of the other sections because I am a big fan of testing things
manually, so I'm not too familiar with most of the tools of this sort.
Feel free to send me names of tools I could add.
 
p.s - If you rather wait for the whole thing together ? just let me
know.
 
Irene
 
1         Default or Guessable User Accounts and Empty Passwords
1.1      Causes
The source for this problem is often inexperienced IT personnel, unaware
of the importance of changing default passwords on installed
infrastructure components, programmers, leaving backdoors so they can
easily access and test the application, later forgetting to remove them,
application administrators and users that chose an easy username and
password for themselves, and application with built in, non-removable
default accounts with a preset username and password. Another problem is
blank passwords, which are simply a result of security unawareness and
willingness to simplify things.
1.2      Blackbox Testing

1.2.1      Manual

Note - before approaching the test, it is important to understand
whether the environment you are testing is a production environment.
Modifying passwords or locking out users on a production environment can
lead to undesired consequences. 
 
In blackbox testing we know nothing about the application, its
underlying infrastructure, and any username and/or password policies.
Often this is not the case and some information about the application is
provided ? simply skip the steps that refer to obtaining information you
already have.
 
When testing a known application interface, such as a Cisco router web
interface, or Weblogic admin access, check the known usernames and
passwords for these devices. This can be done either by Google, or using
one of the references in the Further Reading section.
 
When facing a homegrown application, to which we do not have a list of
default and common user accounts, we need to test it manually, following
these guidelines:
*        Try the following usernames - "admin", "administrator", "root",
"system", or "super". These are popular among system administrators and
are often used. Additionally you could try "qa", "test", "test1",
"testing", and similar names. Attempt any combination of the above in
both the username and the password fields. If the application is
vulnerable to username enumeration, and you successfully managed to
identify any of the above usernames, attempt passwords in a similar
manner.
*        Application administrative users are often named after the
application. This means if you are testing an application named
"Obscurity", try using obscurity/obscurity as the username and password.
*        When performing a test for a customer, attempt using names of
contacts you have received as usernames.
*        Attempt using all the above usernames with blank passwords.
 

1.2.2      Suggested Tools

1.3      Whitebox Testing
The steps described next rely on an entirely White Box approach. If only
some of the information is available to you, refer to blackbox testing
to fill the gaps.
*        Talk to the IT personnel to determine which passwords they use
for administrative access. Check whether these usernames and passwords
are complex, difficult to guess, and not related to the application
name, person name, or administrative names ("system"). Note blank
passwords.
*        Check in the user database for default names, application
names, and easily guessed names as described in the Black Box testing
section. Check for empty password fields.
*        Examine the code for hardcoded usernames and passwords.

Hi Daniel,
Thanks to Alberto Revelli, we have finished a first draft of the
paragraph "Cookie Manipulating".
I don't know if it's better to forward the to the list (may be adding entropy)
or just to you.

Have a great day,
Mat

P.S.: I'll be off-line from 31th July to 15 Aug.

...at last I got back after a few nice days offline.

 

Mark,

 

thanks for your comments.

 

Regarding certs, I never (did I?) recommended using a browser to check for
their validity. Browsers were used in the text to provide a couple of
examples. However, it's probably worth stressing explicitly what you are
saying - don't rely on browsers but on specialized tools to do the check.

 

Webdav: I agree that there's much more to say about that. However, in my own
experience, webdav problems are mostly linked to related vulnerabilities
(file listing exposures, buffer overflows, etc.) than to misconfigurations -
but let's not start a flame war on this, I'm sure opinions will differ
greatly.

Anyway, IMHO the bottom line is:

- if you don't use it or need it, remove it (and MANY times you simply don't
need it...)

- if you *really* need it, pay care to patch it and configure it properly.
This roughly means: grant permissions according to your application
requirements, and nothing more.

Anyone out there with a specific webdav configuration checklist saying a bit
more than the obvious? (ensuring appropriate permissions are required to
exec webdav methods, authorization required where necessary, etc. etc.)

 

I'll be back with an updated version incorporating the list's feedback -
including Javier's stuff about old, backup and unreferenced files (BTW, do
we have Dafydd Studdard's permission to use that material?)

 

Mauro

Mauro, good job. Here are some quick comments. 

 

SSL

 

Shameless plug for SSL 

http://www.foundstone.com/resources/proddesc/ssldigger.htm

Designed to exactly what you describe (and more)

Key lengths are tied to cipher suites

You need to also comment on key exchange protocols (strong cipher with ADH
is not a good idea !)

 

Certs

 

You should not use a regular browser to check certificates. Many of the
API's used by the .NET framework do not adequately check CRL's and CRL
paths. You have to hand the full bang of certs you have etc. Look at API doc
for example. Many browser settings will determine how the relevant API is
invoked. This means certs can be invalid but still report as being valid in
some cases dependent on browser config. They also use the local clock to
determine date time matching so if your local clock is not accurate (i.e.
set forward by 3 months) you will not get a true indication of the cert has
expired. There are also fields you need to look for including usage (I often
see key signing certs on SSL servers). You should also explicitly ensure
people don't think certs are web server certs. JSSE, MSCAPI etc all have
classes where SSL is instantiated from the app itself. This is especially
important in web services where you are not relying on infrastructure to
provide the security. 

 

PS for shits and giggles https://www.verisign.net

 

Backup files - pet hate. Who cares if there is a sample file installed
UNLESS it has a vulnerability. Needs to be made clear to stop the scare
mongerers ;-) Also I think its important to explain the 404 issues and why
Nikto and tools like it usually report so many false positives. 

 

WebDav section needs work but sadly no time to comment now.

Yes - please review both the Guide and your content. I'm working on  
version 2.0.2 at the moment, but any changes or things we've missed  
should go into 2.1.

My view on the Guide vs Testing:

Guide - for solution designers, architects and developers. Positive -  
how to protect your application
Testing - for pen testers and auditors. Negative - what to look for  
and how to detect flaws in the tested application

YMMV

Does anyone have a consolidated copy of the Testing Guide somewhere?  
Ie is it in CVS?

thanks,
Andrew

Message-ID: <6221C3A4-67CF-44B1-A4AA-43F54285FD44@greebo.net>

My view is that the backup files / sample files issue is about:

a) some backup files and many samples have security related problems
b) some samples change between versions allowing easy version  
fingerprinting
c) backup and old files obviate the reasons for using automated  
deployment. People are tempted to make local changes instead of re- 
deploying, and this makes the system over time practically impossible  
to recover or restore

All of those reasons increase the attack surface area for the  
application. If you let folks get into the habit of leaving files  
around, it has been my experience that they will leave the dangerous  
ones around just as often as they'll leave the safe ones around. I  
can't recall the number of times I see config.old or a zip file with  
a complete copy of the application. It's these files that give me the  
screeming heebiejeebies.

Unless I see formmail.pl or similar, I rate this exposure as low in  
my reviews, but as the fix is so easy and the habit as easy to get  
into, I always recommend the removal of these files. If you just say  
no all the time, the attack surface area is reduced for those few  
times when it really is a problem. We can't be there all the time.

thanks,
Andrew

The 2nd phase of the Testing guide isnt in CVS yet as we are still  
waiting for the finished contributions from everyone. Once this has  
been done (im hoping by the end of Aug), ill join it all up and then  
start adding to CVS

Dafydd commited that information to the project so it's under the GFDL 
license. We have permission to use that material since it's under the 
project's works.

So far nobody has asked contributors to provided a signed document 
saying that they allow the (c) to be transferred to the FSF and to 
have their contributions licensed with the same licenses that the 
documents are developed as (GFDL) but we must assume that anybody that 
contributes to this project consents to it.

Javier

Hi all,

Just thought i would say a big thanks to all that have added their  
sections to the finished pile, so far its looking great.
I've attached the outline of who said they would do what, and also  
what's been completed so far (if anything is missing, please let me  
know)

As you can see there is a still a large amount of work to be added,  
so if you feel you are unable to contribute, PLEASE let me know so i  
can re-assign it or write it myself

Thanks

Daniel

I sent some sections a while back [1] but are not listed as completed. 
This includes the sections from "Configuration Management 
Infrastructure": "Known Web Server Vulnerabilities", "Web application 
architecture", "Access and visibility of administrative tools of web, 
application, etc servers.", "Authentication back-ends (LDAP, DBMS, 
text files)". I changed the title in my contribution so maybe that's 
why you did not see them, my fault.

As for the "Configuration Management Application" chapter, I've sent 
all the sections except for "Permissions", "HTML and hidden form 
fields" and "Process permissions". I wanted to review the writing 
style of the other submissions before doing this.

Excuse me if this was provided before, but, shouldn't we use a 
template for all these different sections? I'm seeing contributions 
that closely resemble the OWASP Guide and some others that don't 
follow the same style (like mine).

What's up with all the people that committed do some sections? (some 
others even said that they had almost finished them). It's almost one 
month after the deadline for a first draft and there's just too many 
sections incomplete.

People that contributed, listen up! Please keep up with your promises 
and provide those sections. This resembles too much what happened back 
in 2003 when only a few sections were written in a rather ambitious 
effort to write the testing guide from scratch.

In any case, Daniel, do you have a master document with all the 
current contributions included?

Javier, apologies for missing them out, my bad :(

One of the things i did look at before we started this 2nd section  
was XML. Word is a pain in the ass to work with at the best of times,  
but i felt we needed to get content down asap.

Can the outstanding people please let us know your status?
