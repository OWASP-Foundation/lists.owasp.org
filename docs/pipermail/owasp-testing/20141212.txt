Subject: [Owasp-testing] Translation of the OWASP TESTING GUIDE v4
Message-ID: <BAY179-W368ACF52DD39B6649204E180600@phx.gbl>

Hello Andrew,

I am Tetsuo Kuge, a member of v3 activity via (ISC)2 Japan.

I would like to contribute for Japanese v4.


> If you can lead the translation of the Guide into a language other than
> English please let us know.


If (ISC)2 Japan coordinates voluntary action for v4, I will join to it, but there is no announcement for now.

I would like to check where to start.
