I like Marco's approach. I note that many of the concepts we're talking about (permission boundaries and boundary value analysis) are the domain of functional testers. Should we try to draw a line in the sand between us and them for this version of the Testing Guide to avoid duplication or just go for it?

I agree with Marco that misuse and abuse cases should be captured, analyzed and used to get at some aspects of business logic attacks. I would also say that the notation of UML is somewhat weak in describing attacks that are based on either &#8220;order&#8221; or &#8220;concurrency&#8221; and therefore we may need to go a little deeper in our guidance. 
&#160; 
In thinking about automation, I think I would clarify my response to say that there is value in using it, for example in driving load, etc. The thing I think I would emphasize is that automation doesn&#8217;t really have the ability to always provide the idiot light to blink in that it may not detect anything is wrong. 
&#160; 
I think our guidance should align somewhat with the architecture-style chosen by the application. Consider the scenario where you have a dumb front end that calls a service orchestration. From an IT perspective, developers may technically make a &#8220;service&#8221; stateless, but from a business process perspective may still have state. What happens if service A runs before service B, etc. Another dimension that is frequently ignored is time. What if I find a way to delay execution of a given service without altering either its request or response. This could be highly useful if I want to front-run a few trades on Wall Street for example. 
&#160; 
Another architecture style may be if the application leverages a business rules engine. Consider the scenario of someone wanting to get cheaper auto insurance and wants to get the Gecko to give them more than 15%. An attacker would for gaps in logic where they may be flawed logic in how drivers are classified: 
&#160; 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Noobs: 18 to 25&#160; - Add on 88% 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Average 27 to 34 &#8211; Add on 44% 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Mature 35 to 55 &#8211; Add on 33% 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Old Fars 56 and older &#8211; Add on 77% 
&#160; 
Notice that I skipped the 26 year old. So, finding this type of scenario could be uncovered by doing all permutations of low value to high value and looking for data response outliers vs just response codes. 
&#160; 
In the above, it is important to know that the business logic is actually public. Within insurance, it is known as a rate filing and therefore discoverable by someone who wants to exploit it. I think I am saying that we also need to have definitions that understand who has access to what beyond the typical implementation-level of access control.

&#160; 

A possible way to test for business logic flaws is to derive abuse cases from business logic use cases, data flow analysis and business transaction analysis. The key is model threats, business logic attacks and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Common application vulnerabilities such as forceful browsing, privilege escalation because of lack of enforcement of role base controls as well business logic design flaws in enforcement of strict business logic rules can be exploited &#160;by business logic attacks. Understanding the business logic of the application is critical to derive a set of test cases for identifying business logic flaws. Ideally abuse of business logic should also be reviewed during design and coding as long as the business rules can be reviewed and tested at these stages of the implementation of the application. From security testing perspective you can also think about deriving a set of test cases after threat modeling an application and use and abuse cases have been identified. I have rationalized these ideas in this prezo I did some time ago: <A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/marco_morana/issa-louisville-2010morana">http://www.slideshare.net/marco_morana/issa-louisville-2010morana</A>

Subject: RE: [Owasp-testing] Can you please give me some guidence on the Business Logic Section? 

The challenge of automation is a failure in how testing tools operate. Most tools are wired about the notion of point, shoot, aim and have no understanding of the business process itself. One thing I observed as an employee of The Hartford was how QA folks would recreate the same test case hundreds of times just so it could fit into the testing tool paradigm. For example, hundreds of applications all used say Siteminder that bound to Active Directory. So, authentication is something that should be done once provided it is implemented consistently and reused in multiple places. 

Functional test tools unlike web vulnerability scanners are taking a step in aligning with the notion of business process testing. HP and others in the functional test tool world are releasing functionality in order to enable. See: <A HREF="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1174789#.UObjK3ca7aE">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1174789#.UObjK3ca7aE</A> 

One dimension of testing that I think we should noodle is to not be caught up in just testing of code. While OWASP is developer-centric, we shouldn't be developer-only. If we start with the mindset of automation against code vs starting with the mindset of finding weaknesses in how business processes are defined, we aren't doing the ultimate job of protecting the business. One way to find weaknesses in business processes is through threat modeling where we could provide guidance on identifying invariants, processes run out of sequence, etc

The problem with business logic flaws is that they are often part of a complex multi-step workflow that can be difficult to automate. 

- Jim 


&gt;<i> There is also the other question raised by David, which relates to how we write test cases. A test case should simple and testable. The most understandable security test cases are those that test for a specific vulnerability or class of vulnerabilties. The more specific, the less confusion for the tester and the application owner when they receive the report.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi David, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; Looks like a great compilation of business logic weaknesses and attacks. How did you derive the list from each of the four sources? i.e. why did you pick those weaknesses from the CWE? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My comments are: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) there is a lot of commonality between the four sources (as well as other areas within the Test Guide TOC, e.g. weak password recovery, see 4.4.11). Reconciling these will reduce the length of the list. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) some of the sources have different functions. CWE identifies a weakness that we can test for, the Business Logic Attack Vectors mostly identifies how these can be tested, and the Business Flaws mostly highlights the high level risks to the business if the vulnerability exists and is exploited. However, as some of the sources appear to be cross purpose, this isn't consistent. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding of how you add them to the TOC is to just add them and see if anyone argues :) However, a more active discussion of each section would be good too.
