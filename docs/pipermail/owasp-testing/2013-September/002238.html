<PRE>Pete,

</I>&gt;<i> alleged incident so we can address it in a timely manner.
</I>
In reference to the breach being &quot;almost 4 years&quot; ago:
- The most recent breach is dated May 2013 i.e.
<A HREF="http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/oops-google-search-reveals-private-telstra-customer-data-20130516-2jnmw.html.">http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/oops-google-search-reveals-private-telstra-customer-data-20130516-2jnmw.html.</A>
- Pure Hacking where teaching ISECOM courseware over five years (in
2006) before the initial breach in December 2011 i.e.
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/accredited-open-source-anti-hacking-course-launches-1139263109/">http://www.zdnet.com/accredited-open-source-anti-hacking-course-launches-1139263109/</A>

I can confirm that Pure Hacking requested the modification of the news
article published by Fairfax.  You can also observe a similar
behaviour when Ty Miller refused to be quoted again within
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/thomsons-phone-clone-claims-uncertain-1339338352/">http://www.zdnet.com/thomsons-phone-clone-claims-uncertain-1339338352/</A>
when his initial quote by SMH was challenged.

This is not hearsay based on these quotes (as of Friday 6 September
2013 after 5:15PM (AEST):
1. <A HREF="http://www.purehacking.com/about-us/our-team">http://www.purehacking.com/about-us/our-team</A> - &quot;Staff members are
regular contributors the Open Source Security Testing Methodology
Manual (OSSTMM), certified Trainers of Penetration Testing
Professionals of OSSTMM,&quot;
2. <A HREF="http://www.purehacking.com/news/afd-technical-details">http://www.purehacking.com/news/afd-technical-details</A> - a number of
quotes about &quot;OSSTMM's
  requirement for detecting active filtering such as IDP or IPS&quot;.
3.<A HREF="https://www.purehacking.com/news/active-filter-detection">https://www.purehacking.com/news/active-filter-detection</A> - &quot;As an
OSSTMM auditor Pure Hacking&quot;

Your analogy hasn't considered that Ty (and Pure Hacking) are listed
by ISECOM as a contributor to the OSSTMM and are therefore held to a
higher standard in their implementation of the OSSTMM.

Ty Miller left Pure Hacking in May 2013 according to
<A HREF="http://au.linkedin.com/pub/ty-miller/16/a45/963">http://au.linkedin.com/pub/ty-miller/16/a45/963</A> so I am not sure how
you concluded that PH are not at least a &quot;recent&quot; partner of ISECOM.
I believe Ty Miller is aware of this thread based on his recent
recorded visit to <A HREF="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ChristianHeinrich">http://www.linkedin.com/in/ChristianHeinrich</A>

The easiest course of action would be for ISECOM to issue a press
release clarifying Pure Hacking partnership with ISECOM and OSSTMM
rather than approaching Telstra and/or Pure Hacking to release the
related artifacts

If what ISECOM allege about Pure Hacking's partnership is true than
this won't be their first time that Pure Hacking have been found
guilty of brand abuse i.e.

</I>&gt;<i> In the sec-testing template, there is the following:

</I>&gt;<i> Web Site Searchability

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So while we don't call it what you call it, we do expect it to be

OSSTMM v2 was released almost a decade before December 2011 i.e.
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/accredited-open-source-anti-hacking-course-launches-1139263109/">http://www.zdnet.com/accredited-open-source-anti-hacking-course-launches-1139263109/</A>

I'll add 11.4.2 and 11.6.3 from OSSTMM v3 as references (where
relevant) to OTG-INFO-001 or OTG-INFO-003 of the OWASP Testing Guide.
