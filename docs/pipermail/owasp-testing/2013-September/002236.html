<PRE>Christian,

This isn't a court so stop. Your evidence is not something I can
confirm nor cross-examine. And you don't attack the Medical School if
a doctor is reportedly performing malpractice. Whatever your grievance
with Pure Hacking it's not the fault of us or the OSSTMM but how they
did their business in a particular instance. PH hasn't been an ISECOM
partner for many years so again, not sure why you're coming at us.
What I can do is take your complaint and address PH with it. That's
what we do when a group claims to use the OSSTMM a particular way and
another party thinks it's not true. And I'll do that. Thanks for your
note and next time don't wait almost 4 years to let us know of an
alleged incident so we can address it in a timely manner.

As for your robots.txt stuff:

OSSTMM 3

11.4.2
(c) Examine target web-based application source code and scripts to
determine the existence of additional targets in the network.

11.6.3
(a) Test the depth of access to business or confidential information
available on web servers without any established, required credentials.


OSSTMM 2

In the sec-testing template, there is the following:

Web Page Date Last Modified
Web Links Internal
Web Site Searchability
Web Links External


So while we don't call it what you call it, we do expect it to be
reviewed along with other important information.

Sincerely,
-pete.
