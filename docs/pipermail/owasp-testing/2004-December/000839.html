<PRE>Dinis,

 

Your impassioned open letter is much needed and, hopefully, not too late.  I
support at least a large part of your thoughts on this subject and am keen
to see progress made in much the way you advocate.  However, a few
observations from my personal POV:

 

1.	I would suggest that the success of Open Source projects is directly
related to the nature and motivation of the community they serve.  Linux
succeeded in large part due to the fact that such a &quot;product&quot; was immensely
useful to its participants, who in large part were geeks who wanted to roll
their own &quot;better&quot; *NIX system.  More than intellectually challenging, it
provided a product that many individuals could use.  However, looking at the
OWASP community, I would suggest that the population is more oriented to
Enterprises (like my company) and Software Shops.  This immediately places a
different slant on participants' motivations.  
2.	I don't profess to speak for anyone but myself here, but my openly
selfish objectives are two-fold: (a) align my company's efforts with
emerging de facto standards and (b) gain leverage for my seven-figure budget
in application security.  My preference is to do that with an &quot;open&quot;
standard and not with a vendor and if I can collaborate with my peers in
other organizations, that's even better.  However, by the same token, I do
not want to squander my hard-won budget on projects that do not deliver
within the timeframe I need.  Right now, I find it difficult to contribute
unless I know that the efforts will bear fruit within reasonable time and
that is a basic project management issue: project sponsorship and
commitment.  I am willing to contribute cash, hosted CMS systems and active
staff participation, but I owe it to my company and its shareholders that
this contribution achieves results.  In short, I need guarantees that OWASP
will be a force multiplier to my efforts.  If you want to take OWASP out of
academia and a pure hobbyists' realm, my suggestion is that OWASP needs to
recognize these commercial needs.  
3.	This appears to me a classic project management issue: most projects
fail when there is limited &quot;skin in the game&quot; (read &quot;money&quot;) and when
project accountability is weak.  My advocacy of a strong governance
structure is targeted at exactly this issue.  Membership funding focuses the
mind.
4.	Strong management, well funded, but who are held accountable for
deliverables, is one way to approach this.  This is the model the FS-ISAC
uses and I suggest we need a similar model. That OWASP was born and survived
so long is, in my mind, testimony to Mark's inspirational qualities, but it
is not a scalable architecture.  True governance is needed to deflect some
of my dollars to the project.
5.	I believe that the best part of the Open Source model - widespread
contributions by motivated individuals and academia, as well as peer review
- need not be lost, so long as there is recognition that the main audience
for the products is large organizations.  One approach may be a paid
membership, with fellowship status being awarded to individuals that have
made significant contributions.

 

I welcome your challenge, but as with so many undertakings like this,
critical mass is needed.  I will continue to fund my own projects in this
area and will make good on my promise to contribute these artifacts when
done, but this will be done unilaterally until such time that enough of my
peers and colleagues in other organizations recognize the opportunity we
have to work more effectively under a new, revitalized OWASP organization.

Subject: An Open Letter to Owasp

 

Owasp is in a Crisis!

Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of the
most active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his
reasons for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an
environment where the necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:
    a) prevents the departure of other key players and 
    b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that Mark (and others) will
want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.

As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues to be
a big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of
measures and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end
of this 'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my personal
opinion on several issues which I think are very relevant to the current
Owasp environment/situation.

A) My comments on .... &quot;Owasp's vs Open Source&quot;

Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the moment, in the
Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source should
deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD LIKE
to happen.

I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting the
concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).
