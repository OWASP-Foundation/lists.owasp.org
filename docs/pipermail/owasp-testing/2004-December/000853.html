<PRE>Stanley, et al,

 

I took the liberty of holding a fact-finding discussion with three members
of The Center for Internet Security (CIS): Clint Kreitner (President/CEO),
Bert Miuccio, (Vice President) and John Banghart (Director of Benchmark
Services).  I've reproduced my notes on that meeting below.

 

In summary, CIS shares much the same purpose and history as OWASP.  Of
interest is that their organization experienced many of the same issues we
are facing now and has since thrived.  They currently have growing revenues
from a growing membership and government funding and while it has not been
plain sailing, they have succeeded.  Most importantly, they have expressed
interest in lending their experience to our discussions on the future of
OWASP.  I think we stand to learn much from this organization.

 

I strongly recommend inviting them to our next meeting and will facilitate
this, unless I hear string objections.

 

Please let me know your thoughts.

OWASP seems to share almost identical goals with CIS, in terms of the desire
to develop consensus standards for the benefit of the community at large.
Many of the challenges CIS faced early on in their development appear to be
very close to the challenges OWASP now faces.  It is reassuring to learn
that someone else has blazed a similar trail in the past and made it work.
With this in mind, here are the notes I took during my fact finding
discussion with CIS today, that attempts to reflect their opinion on key
topics of concern to us:

 

On critical success factors:

1.  CIS identified three critical success factors for an endeavor of this
nature:

-         Achieving a critical mass of highly respected people;

-         Having no direct competitors (in terms of organizational goals);
and

-         A simple governance structure (3 people) to avoid &quot;death by
committee&quot; for any initiatives.

2.  The membership list of organizations was the key credibility factor that
attracted critical mass.

 

On governance structure:

3.	Keeping things small was essential to getting things done.   
4.	They expanded the advisory board gradually and only after getting
critical mass in participation. 

 

On priorities:

5.	CIS recognized early on that large scale users of the standards
would be commercial, &quot;end-user&quot; organizations, such as Banks, manufacturing
companies, etc.  Delivery of commercial-grade standards suitable for such an
environment therefore was identified as a priority. 
6.	CIS decided early on to focus efforts on the delivery of these
standards and not to get distracted by activities that did not directly
contribute to these goals (e.g., conferences, committees, local chapters,
etc.).  This focused participation on what mattered most - product
development.

 

On initial funding:

7.	The initial source of funding was a membership drive via the SANS
community.  This was based on the promise to deliver high-value product. 
8.	No sponsorship was allowed from O/S vendors, in part due to the need
to maintain perceived independence. 

 

On developing ongoing revenue:

9.	Ongoing revenue has been maintained through continued delivery of
commercial grade products.  While some members have dropped off, more new
members join than leave and currently the trend is for increased membership.

10.	The project is now attracting government membership and funding. 
11.	Other services, such as training and product certification, have
been identified and actively developed, to provide alternate, sustainable
revenue streams. 

 

On project management:

12.	Projects are run to commercial project management standards.
Consultants are paid for the development of products to professional
standards. 
13.	Intellectual property, however, is not compensated.  Participation
in a consensus project is not compatible with exerting proprietary rights
over such material. 

 

On constituency and participants:

14.	Participation is open to all.  Membership, however, confers benefits
in the commercial licensed use of the standards and products, and influence
in the development of standards (see
<A HREF="http://www.cisecurity.com/membership.html">http://www.cisecurity.com/membership.html</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cisecurity.com/membership.html">http://www.cisecurity.com/membership.html</A>&gt;  for details).  
15.	Comment is sought - and received - from all parties, thus allowing
broad, non-commercial influence, comment and peer review. 

 

On &quot;open source&quot; involvement:

16.	Open input allowed.  Previously, member benefit was initial
involvement, early access, and, to some degree, exclusivity of access and
influence.  However, this did not succeed in attracting a critical mass of
active members.  CIS have now migrated to more open model and invite people
who use it, even if that use is free. 

 

On collaboration:

17.	CIS has always sought partnerships, such as with SANS.  This is
critical to achieving convergence, critical mass and in unifying the
&quot;market&quot;. 
18.	CIS strives to identify working relationships that will help meet
its practical goals.  For example, CIS is actively pursuing such
relationships with the Apache Foundation. 

 

On dealing with vendors:

19.	CIS experienced some skepticism and resistance from vendors of O/S
software, early on in its endeavors.  CIS overcame this by working through
the vendors' customer base.  Vendors kept running into CIS, leading to
eventual recognition and mutual respect. 

 

On future collaboration between CIS and OWASP:

20.	CIS would be happy to share its experience with OWASP and, further,
to explore areas of cooperation, especially in the field of application
server security standards. 
21.	Furthermore, CIS is not adverse to exploring closer ties in
assisting OWASP in developing its governance model.

Subject: Re: [OWASP-TESTING] RE: An Open Letter to Owasp

 

Hello Everyone,

 

Hopefully I don't repeat what Dinis and Denis wrote in their emails. It is
unfortunate that we need a key member like Mark to depart from OWASP to
start a discussion on the direction of OWASP's future.  Moving forward I
hope we can start these types of discussion without key members leaving...

 

Let's put things into perspective, I don't know if OWASP needs a radical
change and it's going to crash and burn.  OWASP needs goals, a clear
direction/roadmap, more organization, funding, and etc...   Basically, OWASP
is a group of security gurus that need some direction and help in business
development.  

 

IMHO to move things forward the following needs to be addressed:

 

1)      Governance - Currently there is very little governance and IMHO this
is the root of the problem.  I don't think most security gurus have the
desire to work on governance.  They rather work on security related issues.

 

I feel that OWASP's future growth will be limited with the current
governance.  Many points in both Dinis and Denis emails should be addressed
and incorporated into OWASP governance. 

 

2)      Leadership - With the current situation of OWASP I think Jeff is
doing well.  He has been the OWASP leader for about 6 months and he achieved
the following:

a.       OWASP Conference - He was one of the key people in establishing the
first ever OWASP conference.  We need to build on the conferences because
this could be a good revenue generator.  

b.      OWASP Foundation - He setup the OWASP Foundation and I'm sure all
legal areas were covered.  I think having a lawyer is beneficial.    

c.       OWASP Portal - He was key in setting up the new OWASP portal.  It's
not the most ideal portal but it's 100% better then the XML portal we had
before.  We still have a way to go on the portal....

d.      OWASP Local Chapters - We now have local chapters.  The OWASP name
is spreading and participation is growing via local chapters. I'm the NYC
chair and our membership and meeting attendance is doing very well. 

 

I do think there is lack of a structured roadmap for OWASP.  Our projects
and ideas are ad-hock. If something cool comes up we'll do it.  There is no
structured roadmap and this should be addressed by Jeff and the OWASP
leaders.

 

3)      Revenue Generation &amp; Sponsorship - Let's create a plan to address
Dinis and Denis issues along with others.

 

4)      Participation - We need to make it clear in each project on what you
can do to participate.  Each project web page should have a standard what
should be included.  I guess this goes back to governance.

 

I can go on and on but I won't.  I suggest we have a meeting with all the
larders to discuss the direction of OWASP.  I'll volunteer to create a
meeting agenda based on everyone's feedback to Mark departure.   I can setup
a GoToMeeting session for all of us.

 

Thanks,
Stan

Dinis,

 

Your impassioned open letter is much needed and, hopefully, not too late.  I
support at least a large part of your thoughts on this subject and am keen
to see progress made in much the way you advocate.  However, a few
observations from my personal POV:

 

1.	I would suggest that the success of Open Source projects is directly
related to the nature and motivation of the community they serve.  Linux
succeeded in large part due to the fact that such a &quot;product&quot; was immensely
useful to its participants, who in large part were geeks who wanted to roll
their own &quot;better&quot; *NIX system.  More than intellectually challenging, it
provided a product that many individuals could use.  However, looking at the
OWASP community, I would suggest that the population is more oriented to
Enterprises (like my company) and Software Shops.  This immediately places a
different slant on participants' motivations.  
2.	I don't profess to speak for anyone but myself here, but my openly
selfish objectives are two-fold: (a) align my company's efforts with
emerging de facto standards and (b) gain leverage for my seven-figure budget
in application security.  My preference is to do that with an &quot;open&quot;
standard and not with a vendor and if I can collaborate with my peers in
other organizations, that's even better.  However, by the same token, I do
not want to squander my hard-won budget on projects that do not deliver
within the timeframe I need.  Right now, I find it difficult to contribute
unless I know that the efforts will bear fruit within reasonable time and
that is a basic project management issue: project sponsorship and
commitment.  I am willing to contribute cash, hosted CMS systems and active
staff participation, but I owe it to my company and its shareholders that
this contribution achieves results.  In short, I need guarantees that OWASP
will be a force multiplier to my efforts.  If you want to take OWASP out of
academia and a pure hobbyists' realm, my suggestion is that OWASP needs to
recognize these commercial needs.  
3.	This appears to me a classic project management issue: most projects
fail when there is limited &quot;skin in the game&quot; (read &quot;money&quot;) and when
project accountability is weak.  My advocacy of a strong governance
structure is targeted at exactly this issue.  Membership funding focuses the
mind.
4.	Strong management, well funded, but who are held accountable for
deliverables, is one way to approach this.  This is the model the FS-ISAC
uses and I suggest we need a similar model. That OWASP was born and survived
so long is, in my mind, testimony to Mark's inspirational qualities, but it
is not a scalable architecture.  True governance is needed to deflect some
of my dollars to the project.
5.	I believe that the best part of the Open Source model - widespread
contributions by motivated individuals and academia, as well as peer review
- need not be lost, so long as there is recognition that the main audience
for the products is large organizations.  One approach may be a paid
membership, with fellowship status being awarded to individuals that have
made significant contributions.

 

I welcome your challenge, but as with so many undertakings like this,
critical mass is needed.  I will continue to fund my own projects in this
area and will make good on my promise to contribute these artifacts when
done, but this will be done unilaterally until such time that enough of my
peers and colleagues in other organizations recognize the opportunity we
have to work more effectively under a new, revitalized OWASP organization.

Subject: An Open Letter to Owasp

 

Owasp is in a Crisis!

Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of the
most active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his
reasons for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an
environment where the necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:
    a) prevents the departure of other key players and 
    b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that Mark (and others) will
want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.

As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues to be
a big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of
measures and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end
of this 'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my personal
opinion on several issues which I think are very relevant to the current
Owasp environment/situation.

A) My comments on .... &quot;Owasp's vs Open Source&quot;

Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the moment, in the
Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source should
deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD LIKE
to happen.

I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting the
concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).
