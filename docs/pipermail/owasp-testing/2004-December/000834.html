Well, I for one would probably not have got half as far as I have 
without Mark's inspiration, assistance and encouragement.

I didn't see the original email that he wrote (guess it didn't make it 
to OWASP-leaders yet), but I certainly think it will be a crying shame 
if OWASP loses Mark's leadership.

I have also felt the disappointment of starting an open source project, 
and getting practically no feedback loop. WebScarab has been in progress 
for almost 2 years (longer if you count the design stages), and even 
now, I get feedback from maybe 3 or 4 users, on a completely sporadic basis.

In some ways, I guess I am as much to blame, for not letting people know 
what is happening, but it can really be demoralising to think that 
something you have devoted significant hours of your life to is not 
making a difference to anyone else.

Add that to the other responsibilities of juggling a career and a 
family, and it is not surprising that Mark is losing interest.

I'm afraid that this is a hallmark of modern societies. I think that the 
number of givers is FAR outweighed by the number of people who are 
prepared to be takers, if the situation allows them to.

&gt;&gt;<i> You will see a new project with a very

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model from OWASP (commercially backed, shared source)in the new year 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ThreatsandCountermeausures.com and lots of free software security

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Foundstone. These are not competitive to what OWASP is doing in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyway, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different....and to me more rewarding at this point. I am one of those 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ADD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people that has to see progress every week or I get frustrated ;-) T&amp;C by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the way was going to be an OWASP project until a radical left wing person

</I>
It is really sad when people who do not contribute demoralise the ones 
who have contributed so much, and still have so much that they could 
still bring to the community.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have met some people I regard as lifelong friends through OWASP. You 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who you are. Its has been a great ride. I thank you for your 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inspiration and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those long nights online, especially in the early days. Ingo, Alex, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Endler,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Steve T, Dave, Dinis etc..I learnt a lot from you guys and everyone 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been involved.
</I>
I feel honoured to have been a (rather insignificant) part of that early 
period, and to have interacted with Mark since then.

&quot;If I have been able to see (at all), it is by standing on the shoulders 
of giants.&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> Have a great Christmas and a peaceful new year!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mark

Wishing everyone, and especially Mark, well over the festive season.
