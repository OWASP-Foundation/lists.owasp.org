Nice! I was also thinking of how the two organizations are complementary 
and have similar goals and the organizations could benefit from each others 
experience. I also have been involved with both organizations. I also think 
OWASP has been very successful especially in raising awareness and in 
setting standards where none existed. It's been slower then we would all 
like, but I think the OWASP Top ten and the guidelines have emerged as 
standards rapidly compared to other areas of security. In particular the 
2004 Visa security program that set security requirements for merchants 
references the OWASP guidelines. (url is below)  Although the wording is a 
little weak, in my experience consulting for several projects, it enough to 
get developers to take action where they wouldn't in the past.  In 2005 
Visa/MC (probably Jan) are coming out with a joint standards, hopefully 
they will strength the wording, but even if they don't OWASP is having a 
big impact on all of the web projects I'm involved with.

I short I see OWASP as already being a success and continuing to be a major 
player in information security.
