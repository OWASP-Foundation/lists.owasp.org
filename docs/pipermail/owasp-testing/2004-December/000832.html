</I>&gt;<i>Its with a degree of sadness that I have decided to leave the OWASP project
</I>&gt;<i>behind and move on to pastures new. This decision has been a long time
</I>&gt;<i>coming and not something I have decided to do without a lot of thought. When
</I>&gt;<i>we started it in 2000 I had no idea I would become so attached to this
</I>&gt;<i>virtual community. I really have. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sadly my na&#239;ve vision of the utopian dream of lots of people coming together
</I>&gt;<i>and working in collaboration to build cool software and documentation just
</I>&gt;<i>hasn&#8217;t materialized the way I had hoped. I have actually become very
</I>&gt;<i>disillusioned with open source projects and simply feel my ever increasingly
</I>&gt;<i>limited time is best spent in other directions in which I personally get
</I>&gt;<i>more fulfillment and less frustration. At this point of my game I think the
</I>&gt;<i>majority of people want free software and not open source; a sad conclusion
</I>&gt;<i>that&#8217;s debatable but I think true. I wanted to produce high quality
</I>&gt;<i>documents and software and lots of it. Like Renuad Derason of Nessus fame I
</I>&gt;<i>am bitterly disappointed at the amount of people that take and don&#8217;t give
</I>&gt;<i>back to the community and as a consequence things just don&#8217;t seem to have
</I>&gt;<i>been moving in a positive direction at a pace I am comfortable with. For
</I>&gt;<i>OWASP the model was broken. We hear of companies having based commercial
</I>&gt;<i>policies on OWASP Guides and using the portal for Intranets, but we never
</I>&gt;<i>hear from them. I really believe that OWASP still has the potential to have
</I>&gt;<i>a huge impact on the web application security world but suspect it needs to
</I>&gt;<i>dramatically re-group and re-organize to achieve that goal. I know Jeff has
</I>&gt;<i>started that process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am certainly not disappearing from the software security scene, quite the
</I>&gt;<i>opposite. Foundstone is a phenomenal place to work and with the commercial
</I>&gt;<i>side of life, cool clients and interesting projects we just seem to be able
</I>&gt;<i>to get more fun stuff done. You will see a new project with a very different
</I>&gt;<i>model from OWASP (commercially backed, shared source)in the new year called
</I>&gt;<i>ThreatsandCountermeausures.com and lots of free software security tools from
</I>&gt;<i>Foundstone. These are not competitive to what OWASP is doing in anyway, just
</I>&gt;<i>different....and to me more rewarding at this point. I am one of those ADD
</I>&gt;<i>people that has to see progress every week or I get frustrated ;-) T&amp;C by
</I>&gt;<i>the way was going to be an OWASP project until a radical left wing person
</I>&gt;<i>expressed their voice about MS and I just didn&#8217;t have the appetite to deal
</I>&gt;<i>with it anymore. This kind of thing is not constructive and needs to be
</I>&gt;<i>stopped if OWASP is to grow. Dinis finds a great balance and should be an
</I>&gt;<i>inspiration to us all IMHO. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Like I said it is of the utmost importance that OWASP carries on to spurn
</I>&gt;<i>the marketing FUD from the likes of WASC and the web app firewall vendors.
</I>&gt;<i>The potential is huge and very important, the possibility of it failing is
</I>&gt;<i>not nice so I hope you folks huddle up and make it happen. I just ask one
</I>&gt;<i>thing please keep out the riff raff !!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have met some people I regard as lifelong friends through OWASP. You know
</I>&gt;<i>who you are. Its has been a great ride. I thank you for your inspiration and
</I>&gt;<i>those long nights online, especially in the early days. Ingo, Alex, Endler,
</I>&gt;<i>Steve T, Dave, Dinis etc..I learnt a lot from you guys and everyone who has
</I>&gt;<i>been involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anything you would have mailed me about for OWASP you can contact Jeff
</I>&gt;<i>Williams (<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing">jeff.williams at owasp.org</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'll see you all at the OWASP conference in NYC which I wouldn&#8217;t miss for
</I>&gt;<i>the world !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Have a great Christmas and a peaceful new year!
