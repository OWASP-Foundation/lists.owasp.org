<PRE>
Hello Everyone,

 

Hopefully I don&#146;t repeat what Dinis and Denis wrote in their emails. It is unfortunate that we need a key member like Mark to depart from OWASP to start a discussion on the direction of OWASP&#146;s future.  Moving forward I hope we can start these types of discussion without key members leaving&#133;

 

Let&#146;s put things into perspective, I don&#146;t know if OWASP needs a radical change and it&#146;s going to crash and burn.  OWASP needs goals, a clear direction/roadmap, more organization, funding, and etc...   Basically, OWASP is a group of security gurus that need some direction and help in business development.  

 

IMHO to move things forward the following needs to be addressed:

 

1)      Governance &#150; Currently there is very little governance and IMHO this is the root of the problem.  I don&#146;t think most security gurus have the desire to work on governance.  They rather work on security related issues.

 

I feel that OWASP&#146;s future growth will be limited with the current governance.  Many points in both Dinis and Denis emails should be addressed and incorporated into OWASP governance. 

 

2)      Leadership &#150; With the current situation of OWASP I think Jeff is doing well.  He has been the OWASP leader for about 6 months and he achieved the following:

a.       OWASP Conference &#150; He was one of the key people in establishing the first ever OWASP conference.  We need to build on the conferences because this could be a good revenue generator.  

b.      OWASP Foundation - He setup the OWASP Foundation and I&#146;m sure all legal areas were covered.  I think having a lawyer is beneficial.    

c.       OWASP Portal &#150; He was key in setting up the new OWASP portal.  It&#146;s not the most ideal portal but it&#146;s 100% better then the XML portal we had before.  We still have a way to go on the portal&#133;.

d.      OWASP Local Chapters &#150; We now have local chapters.  The OWASP name is spreading and participation is growing via local chapters. I&#146;m the NYC chair and our membership and meeting attendance is doing very well. 

 

I do think there is lack of a structured roadmap for OWASP.  Our projects and ideas are ad-hock. If something cool comes up we&#146;ll do it.  There is no structured roadmap and this should be addressed by Jeff and the OWASP leaders.

 

3)      Revenue Generation &amp; Sponsorship &#150; Let&#146;s create a plan to address Dinis and Denis issues along with others.

 

4)      Participation &#150; We need to make it clear in each project on what you can do to participate.  Each project web page should have a standard what should be included.  I guess this goes back to governance.

 

I can go on and on but I won&#146;t.  I suggest we have a meeting with all the larders to discuss the direction of OWASP.  I&#146;ll volunteer to create a meeting agenda based on everyone&#146;s feedback to Mark departure.   I can setup a GoToMeeting session for all of us.

 

Thanks,
Stan

Dinis,

 

Your impassioned open letter is much needed and, hopefully, not too late.  I support at least a large part of your thoughts on this subject and am keen to see progress made in much the way you advocate.  However, a few observations from my personal POV:

 

   I would suggest that the success of Open Source projects is directly related to the nature and motivation of the community they serve.  Linux succeeded in large part due to the fact that such a &#147;product&#148; was immensely useful to its participants, who in large part were geeks who wanted to roll their own &#147;better&#148; *NIX system.  More than intellectually challenging, it provided a product that many individuals could use.  However, looking at the OWASP community, I would suggest that the population is more oriented to Enterprises (like my company) and Software Shops.  This immediately places a different slant on participants&#146; motivations.  
   I don&#146;t profess to speak for anyone but myself here, but my openly selfish objectives are two-fold: (a) align my company&#146;s efforts with emerging de facto standards and (b) gain leverage for my seven-figure budget in application security.  My preference is to do that with an &#147;open&#148; standard and not with a vendor and if I can collaborate with my peers in other organizations, that&#146;s even better.  However, by the same token, I do not want to squander my hard-won budget on projects that do not deliver within the timeframe I need.  Right now, I find it difficult to contribute unless I know that the efforts will bear fruit within reasonable time and that is a basic project management issue: project sponsorship and commitment.  I am willing to contribute cash, hosted CMS systems and active staff participation, but I owe it to my company and its shareholders that this contribution achieves results.  In short, I need guarantees that OWASP will be a force multiplier to my efforts.  If you
 want to take OWASP out of academia and a pure hobbyists&#146; realm, my suggestion is that OWASP needs to recognize these commercial needs.  
   This appears to me a classic project management issue: most projects fail when there is limited &#147;skin in the game&#148; (read &#147;money&#148;) and when project accountability is weak.  My advocacy of a strong governance structure is targeted at exactly this issue.  Membership funding focuses the mind.
   Strong management, well funded, but who are held accountable for deliverables, is one way to approach this.  This is the model the FS-ISAC uses and I suggest we need a similar model. That OWASP was born and survived so long is, in my mind, testimony to Mark&#146;s inspirational qualities, but it is not a scalable architecture.  True governance is needed to deflect some of my dollars to the project.
   I believe that the best part of the Open Source model &#150; widespread contributions by motivated individuals and academia, as well as peer review &#150; need not be lost, so long as there is recognition that the main audience for the products is large organizations.  One approach may be a paid membership, with fellowship status being awarded to individuals that have made significant contributions.

 

I welcome your challenge, but as with so many undertakings like this, critical mass is needed.  I will continue to fund my own projects in this area and will make good on my promise to contribute these artifacts when done, but this will be done unilaterally until such time that enough of my peers and colleagues in other organizations recognize the opportunity we have to work more effectively under a new, revitalized OWASP organization.

Subject: An Open Letter to Owasp


 

Owasp is in a Crisis!

Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of the most active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his reasons for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an environment where the necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:
    a) prevents the departure of other key players and 
    b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that Mark (and others) will want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.

As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues to be a big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of measures and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end of this 'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my personal opinion on several issues which I think are very relevant to the current Owasp environment/situation.

A) My comments on .... &quot;Owasp's vs Open Source&quot;

Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the moment, in the Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source should deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD LIKE to happen.

I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting the concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).
