Subject: [Owasp-testing] Tool for identification application entry points
Message-ID: <20081213193825.GA4525@core.nethemba.com>

Hi guys,
regarding the phase "Testing: Identify application entry points (OWASP-IG-003)"
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Identify_application_entry_points_(OWASP-IG-003)

do you know some fully automated tools that are able to identify application
entry points of all GETs and its parameters, all POSTs and its parameters and
provide the following simple output:

GET: example1.php (par1, par2, par3)
POST: example2.asp (par3, par4)
POST: example3.phtml (par5, par6)

I used Paros, but it has a problem with spidering .NET application where 
every POST is sent with a unique hashed VIEW_STATE checksum.

From Burp suite spider "show results" it is not clear if a given URL is GET
or POST and there is no "export" option to the above-mentioned output.

Webscarab provides only very comprehensive output (all HTTP requests, methods,
hosts, path and its parameters), I just need the summary of all names of all 
used scripts, its method (GET/POST) and its parameters.

I expect really trivial functionality, because for a complex web with 
thousand scripts and parameters I can't do it manually.

Thanks a lot,

Pavol

I used to have a script that will parse the webscarab-generated files
and make a CVS file with all the entry points and the parameters
provided to it. It's really simple to do, if it's useful for others I
can dig it out and send it to the list.

ANNOUNCING THE NEW "OWASP TESTING GUIDE v3

OWASP is announcing the new OWASP Testing Guide v3. The project as
part of the OWASP Summer of Code, started on April 2008 reviewing the
version 2, improving it.
OWASP Testing Guide v3 is a 349 page book; we have split the set of
active tests in 9 sub-categories for a total of 66 controls to test
during the Web Application Testing activity.
Each control has an OWASP name, so for example a SQL Injection is
called: OWASP-DV-005, meaning that it is the 5th control of the Data
Validation category.
We got a dream team of 21 authors and 4 reviewers: after 6 months of
hard work and great team work we realized the v3.

We'd like to ask you to support OWASP to reach the following goals:

*** Continuously improve the guide.
The Guide is a "live" document: we always need your feedback!
Please join our testing mailing list and share your ideas:
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing

*** Promote the Testing Guide.
We would like to have some more media coverage on the guide, so
please, if you know somebody in there put them in touch.
If you have the chance, you can write an article about the Testing
Guide and the new OWASP Projects.
Also you can pick up the OWASP Testing Guide presentations and talk
about it in local conferences and Chapter meetings.
http://www.owasp.org/images/2/2c/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3.ppt

*** Add 'quotes' to the Guide.
We made a special 'quotes' pages for the Testing Guide.
Here we'd want to add all the comments and references to the Guide.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_Quotes

The OWASP Testing Guide includes a "best practice" penetration testing
framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a
"low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for
testing most common web application and web service security issues.

Matteo

Congratulations and well done to everyone involved.  Something to read
in full over Christmas.

Perhaps something got corrupted, but should Tom's quote:

--The OWASP Testing Guide provides people with the insight on how to
test web applications for syntaxual issues (xss, sqi, csrf etc.,) and
insight into business logic flaws that simply can not be found with
automated tools. This is a must read for everyone in security
"Builders and Breakers"--

say (two mods SYNTACTICAL and SQLI)?:
