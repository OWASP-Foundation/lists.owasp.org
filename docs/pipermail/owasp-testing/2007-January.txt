Hi all,
here is the progress status of the OWASP Testing Guide at 17th Dec.


1) Articles
************
All the articles are completed and reviewed except the following:
* 4.9.2 How to test AJAX (Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon will update
it by tomorrow).
*  5.1 How to value the real risk (we can discuss about it for the next
2 days).

I wish to thanks all of you for the excellent work. I think we have
created an outstanding new OWASP methodology for pen testing.

2) OWASP Testing Guide in pdf
*********************************************
I've created a first draft of the Guide in pdf format. It's nearly 300
pages!
We have done a great work: thank you all!

3) Deadline
*************
* Complete the 2 articles by 20th december
* Complete the Guide in pdf format by 23th december

Thanks,
Mat

Hi Juan,
I've created a doc and now the OWASP Foundation is validating it.
I think we have to wait just a couple of days and it will be released in PDF.

Hi,
If you would like to contribute to the code review guide please let me know.
There are many areas to be covered:

Java best security practice practice
C/C++  Best security practice
AJAX/Client side code issues and solutions
PHP Issues and solutions.

and much more,
Eoin

Questions re the code review guide so far as follows:

 Do you have an outline, or is that in development?

- Currently the outline is the current Code review. There are empty sections
in the guide at present that need to be worked on.
-The structure shall be similar to the testing guide in that the chapters
shall be by vulnerability. Each chapter shall have sub sections describing
the vulnerability for different languages if applicable. The existing
chapter structures adhere to this model (mostly).

Do we have a time line?:
-I'd like to get it done by the spring/summer (April/May)

Will this be a sponsored/Funded guide like the Testing Guide (Autumn of
Code)?
- TBD, but I shall be putting it forward if a "Spring of Code" occurs, but
success is not  guarenteed.

Why a Code review Guide?
- We have a development guide (The Guide), a testing guide (The OWASP
Testing Guide) and in my opinion a code review guide would fit in nicely.
Code review is paramount in Secure Application Development (SAD). More so
than testing ( I think).


Next steps:

Agree a structure.
Define sections and sub sections



cheers, -ek

Format of chapters:

*1. Introduction/brief description of <vulnerability>*
*2. *How to locate the potentially vulnerable
code<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_Overruns_and_Overflows#How_to_locate_the_potentially_vulnerable_code>
* *
*3. Vulnerable Patterns for <vulnerability>*
*4. Good Patterns & procedures to prevent <vulnerability>*
*4.1 Code examples*
**
So taking on PHP would mean covering vulnerabilities relating to PHP bad
coding:

XSS would have a PHP section
Remote code execution/OS injection would have a PHP section
SQL injection would have a PHP  section
Configuration errors would have a PHP section.
....and so on.

Hi,
as you may know the guide it virtually finished (for now) and one thing I
wish to do is get it translated.
Currently I have a person to translate to Spanish
French and German would also be nice, so if you wish to volunteer please do
so.

Hi,
Just a note to say that the PDF & doc versions of the testing guide are
available on the Testing site.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project

I'd like to congratulate all involved in this effort, well done, as this is
a key deliverable for the OWASP foundation.

I'd like to ask if people would take a quick read of the book and supply
feedback on the good, bad and ugly. :)
If anyone has any comments or suggestions please mail the list over the
coming weeks as we can incorporate any tweaks prior to the official guide
release date in February.

thanks again,
Eoin

Congratulations! It certainly has taken its time (I was there back in
2003 when we started working on this) but the Guide is now an impressive
document.

I would like to thank Matteo and Eoin for all of their hard work in
getting the document published.

Best regards and a happy new year!

I'll do .NET Code Review Best Practices.

Can I include Design Guidance as a section?  Or maybe we need to consider Secure Application Design for an OWASP project (or do we have plans for this already)?  An example, in ASP.NET 2.0, when do we recommend using the MembershipProviders and integrating with .NET framework before rolling your own access control system.  Design guidance would outline the scenarios for each security design.  What do you think?  

I'll post a topic list by tomorrow.

Regards,

Mark

Hi Mark,
i believe there is a design section but it has not been touched yet:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents

Designing for security (section).

You you consider putting a .NET design section within this.

Authoring the .NET best practice section would be great!! I'll put your name
beside it.
thanks,
Eoin

What is the desired structure for the best practices section? How about
something like this:
 
Vulnerability (with a link to the section that describes the vulnerability)
Best practice 1 - Description (includes how and to what level the
vulnerability is addressed by this best practice)
Best practice 1 - Code example (if applicable)
Best practice 2 - Description
Best practice 2 - Code example (if applicable)
 
etc.

Hi Mark,
i believe there is a design section but it has not been touched yet:
 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents
 
Designing for security (section).
 
You you consider putting a .NET design section within this.
 
Authoring the .NET best practice section would be great!! I'll put your name
beside it.
thanks,
Eoin

I'll do .NET Code Review Best Practices.
 
Can I include Design Guidance as a section?  Or maybe we need to consider
Secure Application Design for an OWASP project (or do we have plans for this
already)?  An example, in ASP.NET <http://asp.net/>  2.0, when do we
recommend using the MembershipProviders and integrating with .NET framework
before rolling your own access control system.  Design guidance would
outline the scenarios for each security design.  What do you think?  
 
I'll post a topic list by tomorrow.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] BETA Release of OWASP LiveCD ready for testing
Message-ID: <00cd01c73836$5134c230$0202a8c0@PacketFocus>

 
Summary:
OWASP LiveCD is ready to download. This distro is Beta Version 0.8 named
"LabRat" and is part of the OWASP Autumn of Code sponsorship. The distro is
focused on providing all of OWASP tools and documents on a bootable CD. The
goal is to have a portable distro that can be used by professional
penetration testers,security admins, Students, or anyone interested in
computer security to perform work,training, or research. All you have to do
is burn the .ISO to DVD or start under Vmware/Virtual PC and you will have a
full Linux desktop environment loaded with OWASP tools and documents.Another
instant advantage is that the CD can be distributed within testing teams and
new hires to ensure everyone has the same tools without spending a week
setting up a laptop. Same scenario applies for students learning computer
security. The CD contains the WebGoat application designed for learning
about application vulnerabilities utilizing easy to follow lessons.( Version
5 will be included this month)
 
 
Details:
I finally got back from holidays and spent the weekend to finish up the BETA
version of the CD. It's quite large right now weighing in at 802mb so it's
just big enough to use a DVD and not a CD. This will be much smaller once
the first round of testing has been completed. The current release v08 seems
to be fairly stable and works on most platforms I have tested on. When the
CD boots up you will notice that all the OWASP tools and docs have icons on
the desktop and can also be found in the programs menu. What I tried to do
was follow the current OWASP  naming convention -Releases,Beta, and
Alpha.This keeps everything organized and also helps adding new tools and
documents. 
 
Issues:
The CD is stable but I'm not having problems starting WebGoat v4 again for
some reason. I had this working all weekend and on several versions I made
yesterday- However, when I burned the final Beta version it stopped for some
reason. ( I may have corrupted a permission or something when I was chrooted
back into the filesystem.) 
 
What's Next?
I have not added tools yet other than OWASP docs and tools. Once the OWASP
material is added and verified the specialty tools such as VOIP, RFID, and
Wireless will be added.
 
BETA TESTERS:
We encourage everyone to download the .ISO and give us feedback on what we
can do to make it better. Also, what tools or docs would you like to have on
the CD? The URL to the mailing list is owasp-livecd at lists.owasp.org  . I can
also be contacted directly - livecd at packetfocus.com
 
Download:
The distro can be downloaded from the PacketFocus website
(http://packetfocus.com/hackos/AOC_Labrat-ALPHA-0008.iso) ((800mb)) After
you download it just burn it to a DVD or use something like Vmware server to
try it out. Vmware is a free download now (www.vmware.com)

This is actually an important question which needs answering.

Personally, I code review in terms of business function as this is the
easiest way to demonstrate your value to your client. For example, if I tell
them that their LDAP server connection is unencrypted, so what? I instead
look at the use cases from the business requirements and ensure that they
are properly demonstrated in the code, and if as a side bar to that process,
I discover weaknesses, I will drop them in, so that:

* The user login process may allow attackers to view all credentials and
thus log in as anyone they want, including the LDAP manager. This destroys
any credibility of logs, transactions and may allow widespread destruction
or alteration of data.

Now the business has a reason to fix my finding as it?s related to a
business process and asset they care about.

This is why I?m not convinced its necessary to have language specific
chapters. Most of the information in those chapters applies will apply to
all languages / frameworks. You can always jump over examples you?re not
interested in, or you can learn from the other language?s issues to avoid
them in your own. 

Thanks,
Andrew

Agreed, context is king. A vuln may be high on an external system that does
not require authentication but  if it was found in a secure LAN on an
internal system with one user it may not be such a big deal.

There is a section on context in the introduction which could be made more
use of but it explains this idea.

Relating to best practice structure I like the structure James Kist has
suggested. It is important to explain why it is good practice and giving an
example why?

Personally, I code review in terms of business function as this is the
easiest way to demonstrate your value to your client. For example, if I tell
them that their LDAP server connection is unencrypted, so what? I instead
look at the use cases from the business requirements and ensure that they
are properly demonstrated in the code, and if as a side bar to that process,
I discover weaknesses, I will drop them in, so that: 



*	The user login process may allow attackers to view all credentials

destroys any credibility of logs, transactions and may allow widespread
destruction or alteration of data. 



Now the business has a reason to fix my finding as it's related to a
business process and asset they care about. 

This is why I'm not convinced its necessary to have language specific
chapters. Most of the information in those chapters applies will apply to
all languages / frameworks. You can always jump over examples you're not
interested in, or you can learn from the other language's issues to avoid
them in your own. 

Thanks,
Andrew

Hi Mark,
i believe there is a design section but it has not been touched yet:
 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents
 
Designing for security (section).
 
You you consider putting a .NET design section within this.
 
Authoring the .NET best practice section would be great!! I'll put your name
beside it. 
thanks,
Eoin

Best practice - > yes.
Vulnerability sections - > No, each vulnerability has language specific sub
section for a language example. Some languages dont have a perticular
vulnerability.
Design review -> Yes (a small bit if we have to).

So we have the "Reviewing Code for...." (Akin to the testing guide which is
"Testing for .....")

This shall have sections of code examples in different languages.

yep? No?

Best practice - > yes.
Vulnerability sections - > No, each vulnerability has language specific sub
section for a language example. Some languages dont have a perticular
vulnerability.
Design review -> Yes (a small bit if we have to).
 
So we have the "Reviewing Code for...." (Akin to the testing guide which is
"Testing for .....")
 
This shall have sections of code examples in different languages.
 
yep? No?

Agreed, context is king. A vuln may be high on an external system that does
not require authentication but  if it was found in a secure LAN on an
internal system with one user it may not be such a big deal.
 
There is a section on context in the introduction which could be made more
use of but it explains this idea.
 
Relating to best practice structure I like the structure James Kist has
suggested. It is important to explain why it is good practice and giving an
example why?

This is actually an important question which needs answering.

Personally, I code review in terms of business function as this is the
easiest way to demonstrate your value to your client. For example, if I tell
them that their LDAP server connection is unencrypted, so what? I instead
look at the use cases from the business requirements and ensure that they
are properly demonstrated in the code, and if as a side bar to that process,
I discover weaknesses, I will drop them in, so that: 



*	The user login process may allow attackers to view all credentials
and thus log in as anyone they want, including the LDAP manager. This
destroys any credibility of logs, transactions and may allow widespread
destruction or alteration of data. 



Now the business has a reason to fix my finding as it's related to a
business process and asset they care about. 

This is why I'm not convinced its necessary to have language specific
chapters. Most of the information in those chapters applies will apply to
all languages / frameworks. You can always jump over examples you're not
interested in, or you can learn from the other language's issues to avoid
them in your own. 

Thanks,
Andrew

What is the desired structure for the best practices section? How about
something like this:

Best practice 1 - Description (includes how and to what level the

Best practice 1 - Code example (if applicable)
Best practice 2 - Description

IMHO, I think if the guide is to have any worth, we need to be specific - general recommendations make a good opening section - but code quality is ultimately at the level of the code and the proper usage of the language in which that code was written.   I think, otherwise, we are talking about the items in a general sense that Jim outlined - it's good to know and reiterate "Input Validation" as a general term and broken access control examples in general terms, but I think it would also be helpful to include best practice recommendations.  For example, C++ code can use the strsafe.h functions (instead of the early more vulnerable functions, e.g. strcopy) or if using VS.NET use /clr:safe, you can compile with many restrictive security checks in place or whatever other components / libraries specific to the development environment.  I could list out many specific practices for each version of ASP.NET (C#, VB.NET, C++) / SQL Server, etc.  Another that comes to mind - in ADO.NET are we using datareaders and never closing the database connection, exposing the system to a DoS, even unintentionally?

I'm sorry to ramble, but I think it is important to maybe hit the Top 5 for each language / environment.  Just my .02.

  Noting that the LDAP server is unencrypted is part of a application infrastructure audit. Many very smart orginizations do this since encrypting LDAP is a HUUUUUGE hit, so they put LDAP in a private subnet and do a few other things to not have to encrypt LDAP. 

  99% of the time during an audit, there are no requirements docs to match against code. So as part of my audit, I both build the proper documentation for the app, and write the remediation/audit document. How can you audit business processes if there are not requirement's to match them against?

  When I do a code audit, I look for 3 main things: (And I'm doing mostly J2EE)

  1) Input Validation - like a religion, I check all input data from users, config files, databases even (output sanitization), headers - every piece of data entering a software system needs to be centrally validated.
  2) Authentication/Access control 
  3) Session Management (when its custom)
  4) Overall Code Quality

  Then I run all code through Fortify or FindBugs and use that to find low-hanging fruit.

  Manual review is clocking about 100 lines of code/hr when done with integrity, so most of my code reviews involve me creating large teams of auditors.

  Management always disagrees with me some, so I just document my opinions and findings CLEARLY to protect myself, and let management make the call.

I also on board on the need to have language specific information (and the
beauty of the WIKI is that we have plenty of space :) )

This (language specific data) will also be very usefull in the cases (which
tend to happen now and again) where the tester is doing an audit to an
language that he/she is not an expert on.

For example I'm very confortable with .Net, Java or C++, but if I need to do
a PHP or Cold Fusion audit (which happens once in a while) I would find
really usefull to have all the 'gotchas' of those languages in one place.
Another example is the different Java Application Servers (Web Logic,
Webshere, JBoss, JOnAS) that have have different problems and issue (like
wise for the .Net Framework and Mono)

There is one key element in this project that I think is currently missing,
which I will write in a separate email since I want to start a fresh
discussion thread about it :

We must take this opportunity and use some of the energy that is going into
the Code Review Guide to create a Code Scanning Tool which identifies the
issues raised.

I don't care if in its initial version it is just a bunch of regEx and
cleaver searches (ideally we would expand of projects like our own OWASP
LAPSE Project <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_LAPSE_Project>,
but I don't want the guide to be depended on a tool development)

What I would like to happen is that for each major issue (or 'gotcha')
covered in the Guide, information would be provided on how to detect that in
a semi-automatic way.

I know that there are exceptions (and let's keep the business logic
vulnerabilities out of this one) but most issues should be detectable.

Wouldn't it be possible to extend existing OSS tools (such as 
Flawfinder, which is actively being developed) for the OWASP specifics 
of Code Review?

I mention Flawfinder (and not Rats) because it seems to be more actively 
developed. It has been brought to my attention that the latest release 
(1.27) includes the capability to work with control version systems 
(reporting on the differences found when making changes).

Just my 2c

In the Java space, the OWASP LAPSE tool is easily the best open  
source security code review tool available, IMO.  The other  
contenders such as: findbugs and PMD include only limited security  
tests.
But LAPSE is far from perfect, and it would be great to be able to  
extend this tool to compete with the commercial offerings.  What  
would be really useful is:
- Support for .NET (this could be a LOT of work)
- Support for scanning xml configuration files (and the necessary  
rules for the most popular J2EE servers)
- Support for JSP and JSF

Am I correct in assuming that flawfinder can only find issues in C/C+ 
+ code?  If so, this would be of limited benefit to the web app world  
because it's not used as often as things like .NET, PHP and even RoR.

Are there any existing tools in OSS land for .NET and PHP?

True, flawfinder only works currently for C/C++ code (RATS provides 
coverage of more languages including PHP, Perl and Python). Anyone of 
them, however, could be possibly extended to cover more languages. Maybe 
that's a SoC project on it's own.

> Are there any existing tools in OSS land for .NET and PHP?

For PHP: Rats
For .NET: I don't know of any

I was thinking of using the "Checkstyle" framework?
Check it out (google Checkstyle).

Totally agree. Best practice should cover the Top 5 in many languages. - see
wiki structure.
The vulnerability section should include examples of bad code (anti-pattern)
and examples of good code and reasons why for each.

Do not want to sound discouraging on the subject, but this is a code auditing
guide and we are not only facing the equivalent of business logic layer
requirements but are ultimately up against the level of machine language code
generated from different compilers. I have to admit, they do make good
reccomendations and are liked by the client!

Perhaps not every language, but ultimately general language categorizations will
be required. Overflows do not exist in java say, but are there in perl. This
example might be basic; it illustrates the point.

And ultimately we have to look at what people are coding in. Most popular are
java and .net frameworks. There are a number of things you can do in one that
you cannot do in the other. A separation between the two will most definately be
required.

Personal opinions; all comments welcome.

Thanks,

Subere

Noting that the LDAP server is unencrypted is part of a application
infrastructure audit. Many very smart orginizations do this since
encrypting LDAP is a HUUUUUGE hit, so they put LDAP in a private subnet
and do a few other things to not have to encrypt LDAP.

99% of the time during an audit, there are no requirements docs to match
against code. So as part of my audit, I both build the proper
documentation for the app, and write the remediation/audit document. How
can you audit business processes if there are not requirement's to match
them against?

When I do a code audit, I look for 3 main things: (And I'm doing mostly
J2EE)

1) Input Validation - like a religion, I check all input data from
users, config files, databases even (output sanitization), headers -
every piece of data entering a software system needs to be centrally
validated.
2) Authentication/Access control
3) Session Management (when its custom)
4) Overall Code Quality

Then I run all code through Fortify or FindBugs and use that to find
low-hanging fruit.

Manual review is clocking about 100 lines of code/hr when done with
integrity, so most of my code reviews involve me creating large teams of
auditors.

Management always disagrees with me some, so I just document my opinions
and findings CLEARLY to protect myself, and let management make the call.

Mark,

I hear where you are coming from. In the real world, here is my dilemma:

1) If I focus on reviewing low level aspects of how Java is used, It
really does help secure the application, or only helps in a minimal way.
2) Even crappy written Java (say, using all public scope) can be secured
by using proper input validation, auth code, etc....
3) Now, if we are talking APPLETS, then low level review is
ultra-crucial, but applets are inherently insecure and I recommend that
anyone using enterprise applets roll off of them. (Several other
security pro's agree)
4) I think you are going in the right direction, but many of the low
level recommendations I get from Fortify and others really do not help
secure J2EE applications.

http://searchappsecurity.techtarget.com/expert/KnowledgebaseAnswer/0,289625,sid92_gci1218180,00.html?asrc=SS_CLA_302549&psrc=CLT_92
= the level of support I think we walk to focus on.

Mark, you are right on - but how can we make those top 5 Java
recommendations really help folks secure their apps?

Aloha,
Jim

I think, otherwise, we are talking about the items in a general sense that Jim outlined - it's good to know and reiterate "Input Validation" as a general term and broken access control examples in general terms, but I think it would also be helpful to include best practice recommendations.  For example, C++ code can use the strsafe.h functions (instead of the early more vulnerable functions, e.g. strcopy) or if using VS.NET use /clr:safe, you can compile with many restrictive security checks in place or whatever other components / libraries specific to the development environment.  I could list out many specific practices for each version of ASP.NET (C#, VB.NET, C++) / SQL Server, etc.  Another that comes to mind - in ADO.NET are we using datareaders and never closing the database connection, exposing the system to a DoS, even unintentionally?

> but I think it would also be helpful to include best practice
recommendations.

1) Never use Applets for enterprise application. Java .class files
should never be deploying in untrusted environments. There, that was easy.

2) Ok, so we are truly talking J2EE servers primarily for web
application deployment (ok, this is OWASP afterall).

2a) If someone starting talking about the importance of not using inner
classes, I'm going to scream :) I see so many recomendations that truly
have nothing to do with security. Sure, code quality is important be we
want to give specific recomendations to code Java/J2EE apps

Ok, starting with Input Validation:

-        Ensure that all form, header, cookie and configuration data is validated on the server 

-        Do not depend on any client-side input validation

-        Accept only unproblematic characters (white list input validation) as opposed to rejecting bad characters.

-        ***** (big one) Use regular expressions in a way that is configurable by an InfoSec professional and does not require programmer intervention. This provides InfoSec administrators the possibility to react to 0-minute exploits. 

-        Identify the legal characters (often a regular expression) and reject all else

-        Ensure that all input validation logic is placed in a centralized library that all programmers are forced to use

My biggest concern is that the topics on Java at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents
are not even close to the "top 10":

   1. Inner classes      bah <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Inner_classes>
   2. Class comparison            big deal if you control the namespace
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Class_comparison&action=edit>
   3. Cloneable classes            yea this is good
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Cloneable_classes&action=edit>
   4. Serializable classes             dont do it
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Serializable_classes&action=edit>

   5. Package scope and encapsulation                      nice, but not
      top 10
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Package_scope_and_encapsulation&action=edit>

   6. Mutable objects                                             nice
      but not top 10
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Mutable_objects&action=edit>
   7. Native Methods                     dont do it
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Native_Methods&action=edit>
   8. Private methods & circumvention                           dont use
      applets or native methods, enough said
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Private_methods_%26_circumvention&action=edit>

   9. Static Fields                                       make access to
      static threadsafe, but all the hype over statics being bad is
      applet centric
      <http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Static_Fields&action=edit>


So what do we really want to focus on here, gentlemen?

> IMHO, I think if the guide is to have any worth, we need to be specific - general recommendations make a good opening section - but code quality is ultimately at the level of the code and the proper usage of the language in which that code was written.   I think, otherwise, we are talking about the items in a general sense that Jim outlined - it's good to know and reiterate "Input Validation" as a general term and broken access control examples in general terms, but I think it would also be helpful to include best practice recommendations.  For example, C++ code can use the strsafe.h functions (instead of the early more vulnerable functions, e.g. strcopy) or if using VS.NET use /clr:safe, you can compile with many restrictive security checks in place or whatever other components / libraries specific to the development environment.  I could list out many specific practices for each version of ASP.NET (C#, VB.NET, C++) / SQL Server, etc.  Another that comes to mind - in ADO.NET are we using datareaders and never closing the database connection, exposing the system to a DoS, even unintentionally?

I'd strongly recommend using bytecode for Java and .NET.  The compiler
handles a LOT of sticky issues for you - like resolving symbols, so you
can make much more sophisticated rules.  For example if you see a call
to runtime.exec() in a Java program, what type is the "runtime" variable
- probably Runtime, but it could be something else.  All variables are
resolved in the bytecode.

 

If you're interested in a supercharged engine, James Gosling's Jackpot
engine is really really cool.  It's basically an API for source code.
See http://jackpot.netbeans.org/.  You can use it to find problems, and
ALSO to actually transform the code.  It's integrated into netbeans, but
I spent a few hours to extract it and make a command line version.
Never did anything with it though.  If anyone wants to pick up that
work, let me know.

I'm beginning to sound like a LAPSE cheerleader, but why should we  
reinvent the wheel when there is already a Java code review tool that  
is not only open source, but it's an existing OWASP project!

I agree totally. Jackpot is really for something different.  Actually
the engine is really the simple part.  The hard part is collecting
rules.  Even if we just write them down in English it would be
incredibly useful.

Hi,
Is there a Javadoc for Lapse?
Is this Java only? I think we could get checkstyle to do any language.

Hi,
Someone has be putting "helpful" comments in some sections of the Code
review guide, such as:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Native_Methods

"The moment you start writing native methods you leave the Java security
manager and memory protection faculties. Don't do it."

Firstly this is not helpful to anyone involved in code review.
Secondly if we are performing a code review on a native method code block
this advice is too late and useless.
Thirdly, sometimes native methods need to be used for legacy reasons.

The guide is to show what to look for in code review, This helpful advice is
firstly aimed at the developer and hence no good for a code reviewer.

thanks,
Eoin

Well, what you need is to tweak that statement a bit to make it correct:

"The moment you see native methods (which leave the Java security manager
and memory protection), you know you found an area that might contain
potential Buffer Overflows, or other C++ type vulnerabilities."

And I will add

"In the .Net Framework this is even more problematic due to the high usage
of unmanaged COM objects (Note to Dinis: Put here details about his 'Buffer
Overflows on the .Net Framework' Research)"

I'm with Stephen on this one, we should leverage LAPSE's work and take it to
the next level (I also like the fact that LAPSE is an Eclipse plug-in). For
reference you can get LAPSE from here
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_LAPSE_Project

Benjamin Livshits (LAPSE project leader), can you join this thread (which
started here:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2007-January/001324.html) and
share with us your plans for LAPSE?

Thanks

In the Java space the best code scanning tool I see in the OSS space is
FindBugs; and in the commercial space I think Fortify is best.

Instead of worrying about building an actual code scanning tool, why not
focus on maxing a flaw taxonomy database that any tool vendor or OSS
project can use?

That was me, Eoin. There are betting ways that Native Methods any they
should not ever be used by web programmers. Corba is safer. I stand by
my originial statment  that Native Methods should never be used in Web
Applications and if found in cod review it should be flagged and
immediately rolled away from.

I can help with the PHP code review items as long as it can be implemented
in a language neutral way. Luckily, PHP?s vulnerability sources (those
couple of hundred functions and constructs which are a bit dodgy) are
relatively easy to identify, but input taint is HARD with a capital H, A, R
and D. It might be easier to use a php -> JVM or php -> .net IL compiler and
use that to determine what is actually happening.

LAPSE has caused Eclipse 3.2.1 on Intel MacOS X to barf, so there?s some
stability issues to be worked out as well. The next time it happens, I?ll
take good note of the VM exception.

Thanks,
Andrew

Cool and I agree,
but its still out there and a fact of life. Describing the issues with
native methods in code and with the aid of some examples, it would be best
delivered so developers,given the choice would avoid this path.

Eoin,

You are right on, as usual. I just wanted to get the ball rolling - I'll
be sure to add more complete commentary moving forward.

Sweet,

I think that (for several reasons, but mainly for practical, operational and
user value) OWASP needs to have its code scanning tool which is used to
validate and test the rules proposed (even if some of the test cases are
developed in a way that allow its detection by our tool).

And here is what I think the commercial vendors in this space should be
doing:

   - Work with OWASP in the defintion of these test cases (and note that
   I am including here both documentation / taxonomy and automated code
   scanning tests)
   - Create products that are able to detect those issues much more
   effectively, with lower number of false positives, better GUI, better
   support and 'management-level support services' (which is why companies will
   pay for these tools/services).
   - Focus their development and research efforts in detecting 'Business
   Logic Vulnerabilities' which are much harder to detect but can be as
   dangerous/exploitables as 'technical' issues like SQL Injections.
   - Get into the field of 'real time application profiling, fuzzing and
   exploitation detection' which will detect many more vulnerabilities
   - Work on the development of GUIs designed specifically for security
   consultants performing source code audit. Actualy what I really wanted was
   something like Google's Mondrian (
   http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-8502904076440714866 ,
http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/11/google-mondrian.html
   ) with a focus on security source code review. This web based source
   code review solution designed for source code audits, would be a killer
   application specially if it was able to:
      - perform automatic checks on code for security vulnerabilities
   - using RegExs
      - using language specifc analysis (.Net, Java, Phyton, C++,
         etc..)
         - using Sandboxes where exceptions are monitored and used
         to determine non-normal behaviour
         - document those findings and initiate a review workflow,
      - aid the security consultant/auditor in classifying the risk of
      the issue identified (and find other instances of that issue)
      - aid in the normal security source code review process (for
      example by identifying all data inputs or all authorization decisions)
      - aid in the resolution of the issues (maybe with code samples
      or auto-correction features)

Ideally we would end up in a situation where anybody is able to detect
automatically most of 'technical' security issues (SQL Injection, XSS, Bad
Configuration Settings, etc..) using a free OWASP tool. This tool would be
could be used during Code Development (as part of the check-in of code) or
during Security Audits.

Comercial companies would continue to pay for specialized (see list above
for why) products who are more expensive but (in principle) more targeted to
large comercial companies needs.

If we get this rigth, we would make a massive difference in the number of
vulnerable applications out there (and the good news is that clients would
be able to demand that the code that they are buying was 'at least' analyzed
with these tools).

I actually think that this could be the one of the most important OWASP
projects and could be the one that would make the most difference chaging
the (in)security landscape of our web applications.

Of course that I am NOT saying that these tools will be able to detect every
single vulnerability (and note that I am excluding business logic
vulnerabilities from its capabilities). What I am saying is that is it
possible to build a code scanning tool which is able to detect 80% to 90%
(or more) of certain types of Critical, High and medium vulnerabilities.

HI,
The OSSTMM manual covers more than just App Sec.
but some areas of interest would be :

Security Metrics
Legal Penetration Testing Checklist
Competitive Intelligence

maybe we should consider new sections after this initial release. say
release 2.1?
Also the metrics data/info can be ref'ed from the owasp metrics project and
the guys from that project in some manner?
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Metrics_Project

I also think we should stay away to a degree from academia/theory and stay a
little more hands on in the testing guide?
what ya all think?

Here's what I found in the application-related chapters of the Information
Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF), by chapter:
 
WEB APPLICATION SECURITY ASSESSMENT
T.6.7 Identifying Application Server (such as tomcat or other middleware) -
is this in the OWASP guide? I did not see it.
T.6.9 Copy web site (Offline) using tools such as HTTTRACK, Black Widow,
WebCopier, wget. Not sure if this is explicitly mentioned in the OWASP
guide.
 
WEB APPLICATION SECURITY ASSESSMENT (CONTINUE.) - SQL INJECTIONS
Very thorough and with lots of examples. Probably deserves a reference.

SOURCE CODE AUDITING
Did not look at, as I think this relates more to the Code Review project.
Agreed?
 
BINARY AUDITING
Incomplete chapter - looks they could use a reference here to our guide :)
 
APPLICATION SECURITY EVALUATION CHECKLIST
Has a pretty good evaluation checklist that covers technical and
administrative controls (such as separation of duties, sufficient staff,
NDAs for contract programmers, security in the SDLC, etc.)
 
DATABASE SECURITY ASSESSMENT
Covers vendor-specific database permissions and security settings. Good
stuff. Do we want to include in the OWASP guide? Or just a reference?

I have a little chat with Jeff Williams and he feels that Java Applets
are relevant. So, I'm game to move all my thinking in that direction.

However, I think we should split the code review guide into 2 separate
language-specific Java categories - one for applets and another for
server-side J2EE.

When deploying applets, you are essentially dropping live source code
into an untrusted environment and suddenly you have a huge list of new
concerns:

1) don't depend on applet input validation (verify at server)
2) do not store sensitive business logic in applets
3) assume all applet classes can be decompiled into source no matter what protections you take
4) do not store sensitive information in applet static
5) Assume that all private applet methods can be circumvented 

Whereas J2EE concerns are radically different since we are talking about code deployed in a trusted environment only exposed to the outside world via ports 80/443 - so any treatise on J2EE code auditing might start at web.xml so we understand the exposed endpoints - not to mention that the primary applet concerns are no longer so relevant regarding server side J2EE programming....

...

Anyhow, I'm sorry if I'm going in the wrong direction or if you disagree, I'm just trying hard to keep the conversation going.

Yep, I agree, the real valuable stuff is the vulnerability database  
and how to identify those vulnerabilities in a given bit of code.   
How this is implemented in an automated tool is a secondary concern.

And also, the "Open Source" thing faded away long time ago (when ISECOM 
was introduced) the license is not at all OSS and neither is the 
development process anymore (just take a look at how many time they've 
had a 3.0 release and only provide it to those who pay)

I'd rather not link OWASP and OSSTMM. If some idea is interesting from 
the manual I suggest it was redone instead of reused.

Just my 2c.

Interesting.  I've had the opposite experience.

I know they are tight on controlling the submissions but they are  
very much still open as anyone who contribute regularry may tell you.  
Looking at 2.2: it has an OSS license.

Here in Italy I use OSSTMM for many Gov related work and it has  
served me well in the latest yers but that is only my experioence, of  
course...

When I asked about 3.0 they said it isn't available because it wasn't  
finished AT ALL. When they released 2.0 publicly it was unfinished so  
it made problems because nobody knew if we should use it.  Now they  
said they won't release 3.0 publicly until it's done and reviewed  
because of how many companies and government organizations use it as  
a standard. It makes sense to me.
And to pay for beta access is okay because we all know there is no  
such thing as a free lunch.... I think hey have to pay their bills  
somehow.

> I'd rather not link OWASP and OSSTMM. If some idea is interesting from

You know, I've an attitude of mine that has saved me thousands of  
hours. It's pretty simple end isn't long at all to memoriza as it  
only states: "DO NOT reinvent the wheel".

Someone at OSSTMM did a very good job in some area, we here did a  
bunch of VERY GOOD work in another. Let's just sit and find out how  
to share this knowledge and come out with a finished product that is  
better than the single part and yet tokk us a fraction of the total  
time a rewrite would have taken. I don't really think Apache would  
have been so good had ANYONE in the world reimplemented an HTTP demon  
at every turn...

This are, of course, my unworthy 2 euroCents, but I though someone  
had to say it...

If needed I can directly contact Pete (Herzog) and ask him to sit  
around a table. And I can DRAG him to do it if needed ;) We're in  
good spoking terms, even if I'm not part od ISECOM and/or OSSTMM myself.

Let me know and I'm (as usual) here if needed.

Let's be a NOVELITY: let's BUILD instead of DEMOLISH the other parts...
I know that "divide et imperat (divide and rule)" motto is deep  
within every security guy and that your solution is always better  
than mine, but throwing another standard in the game would only  
(IMHO) confuse the final user and create a very high FUD factor. We  
don't want it, so for the sake of novelity let's cooperate...

At least, this is what i'd do....

Greetings for an almost-springtime Italy.

yep, we need to do a bit on this also. in the code review guide.

Not sure about this, maybe in the next release.

We have a small bit on Oracle/Listener security etc.
More shall be in code review guide (Mysql).
Not sure if we want to open the DB "Can or worms"?

Matteo, thank you very much for such elequent argument on the collaboration
between OWASP and ISECOM, which I completely agree.

Let's remember that the objective here is to guive the OWASP Testing Guide
users the best available resource and information. So it makes all sense to
put in there references, comparions and notes on other similar works that
might be of value to the OWASP Testing Guide readers.

Let's build bridges here since I'm sure ISECOM users will also benefit from
the OWAPS Guide.

Matteo got it spot on here: "Someone at OSSTMM did a very good job in some
area, we here did a bunch of VERY GOOD work in another. Let's just sit and
find out how to share this knowledge and come out with a finished product
that is better than the single part and yet tokk us a fraction of the total
time a rewrite would have taken. ".

So I proposed that we include a section (couple pages) in the OWASP Testing
Guide about the areas that ISECOM document are worth looking at. And this
pages should actually be co-writen by somebody from ISECOM. Matteo can you
see if Pete Herzog can help?

Let's all have a group virtual hug now.... :)

Great stuff, great debate, I like this new OWASP :)

Hang on one moment on the group hug there busta!!

The latest version is OSSTMM.3.0 (which is in RC mode). Now to access  
this you need to be a GOLD, or Silver, member and Gold costs $259 and  
Silver $49
If you want the free version, well thats stuck at ver 2.0 and has  
been for years now.

If you are saying we collaborate, and i have no issue with this, then  
something needs to be done.

It might say open source on the tin, but from where im sitting it  
looks like a pay as you go open source and im sorry, none of the  
content i have written will ever be charged for and this is one of  
the sole reasons i joined with Mark and Jeff when OWASP was started  
back in the day.

OSSTMM is in RC and will see the light in just a few time.
You can rest assured of this since I've talked with Pete about that a  
lot of times. (And is someone care I perfectly agree on "2.0 sucks",  
while 3.0 is another thing at all...).

I'm sure we can find an accommodation and I'm sure I'll be able to  
provide the 3.0 for review to a panel of OWASP... Or so I think... I  
may have to press Pete a little, but I'm sure that's feasible.
And I don't really believe in "insurmountable" tasks.

No one told you to give content to OSSTMM.
We were discussing in "taking" content from OSSTMM acknowledging the  
source and have OSSTMM "refer" to code within OWASP.
Sorry if my bad english went in the way and you were lead to think  
I'd give your work for a paid submission.. That wasn't my idea.

This is a very good idea Jim.
I think we should have an Applet section to address these concerns.
Do you want to do it?
I shall put a chapter in the wiki for you if you are game?

I contacted Pete "in the general terms" not referring directly to  
OWASP to see what does he think and he just seemed enthusiastic about  
the idea.
I can bet safely that Pete (or someone for him in ISECOM)  will be  
glad to help as he's always been a very talkative and supporting guy  
(in my experience). And I'd really like to put a stop to all this  
nonsense in the "standard war".
And if Pete is too busy there's always the dear friend Raoul Chiesa  
in the italian Board of OWASP... And if both of them are too busy  
I'll take the task and coax both of them into doing giving me  
information... I'm a very good bully if needed be ;)
...And I know where Raoul lives, btw... <grin>

<raving mode on>

You know, I really think all these wars must end. And quickly...
As Board of the Italian Computer Society hundreds of people come to  
me to ask question about career (especially in Computer Security,  
which is my line of business).. I tend to tell them to look at  
different perspectives and documents but it is very HARD for people  
to learn something when they have 10 different "standars" players  
saying 10 different things (and most of the time shouting insults at  
each other)...
In these late years I've been a sort of "human linked-in" with many  
and many guys from different security associations and groups, trying  
to inspire them to collaborate and  to join forces...
Let's think this is a first step in giving the STANDARD USER a more  
simple approach and a simple way to know BOTH OWASP and OSSTMM.
And I think we should event talk with ISO270001 and many many other.

At the end of the tale please consider that users embrace not the  
BEST technology, not the MOST INNOVATIVE technology, not the CUTTING  
EDGE technology but always and only the ONE WHICH SIMPLIFY THEIR  
LIFES the most. If we can give the user something to simplify his/her  
path to knowing security problems then ALL OF THEM will come after us...

This mail might sound harsh, but I just want to get the facts straight 
for everyone interested. I sincerely think that OWASP would be better 
off collaborating with Information Systems Security Assessment Framework 
(ISSAF) than with ISECOM's OSSTM. But, then again, it's not my call.

Does OSSTM really use an OSS license? I'm sorry I'm going to be the one 
that dissapoints you, but the answer is a very big NO.

Here are the facts:

* Version 2.0 (released february 2003) refered to the GPL but had this 
statement in the front page of the document: "Any information contained 
within this document may not be modified or sold without the express 
consent of the author."

* Version 2.2 (released november 2006) [1] (c)footer states "Any 
information contained within this document may not be modified or sold 
without the express consent of ISECOM. OSSTMM for free dissemination 
under the Open Methodology License (OML) and CC Creative Commons 2.5 
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs"

* The "Open Methodology License" is *not* an open source license (or an 
open document license for that matter), please read 
http://www.isecom.org/oml.shtml

* The CC Creative Commons 2.5 with NoDerivs and NonCommercial attached 
to it is *not* an open source license

They are not open source because nobody (besides ISECOM) can:

- make new versions of the OSSTMM
- use OSSTMM for commercial purposes (including packaging it and selling 
it in a book)
- nobody can make commercial software based on the OSSTM (without 
violating the OML)

OSS licenses (See www.opensource.org) do allow commercial use of the 
work and, indeed, is one of the pillars of open source. See the Open 
Source Definition (http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) 
specifically:

- "1. Free Redistribution"
- "3. Derived Works"

I repeat: something that does not allow for somebody else to profit from 
it (yes, even if he did not contribute) is *not* open source. It is 
"gratis" source (i.e. it's "free" beer but not "free" speech).

In contrast ISAAF documents stricly adhere to the GFDL in their licenses 
and they even gives away their (c) to the Free Software Foundation.

Further proof of ISECOM no longer providing an OSS product is the fact 
that its community has really faded away. The activity on the public 
mailing lists has been fading since the license change and is now 
esentially cero.

ISECOM certainly does not follow the "release early, release often" 
model, and has a tight control of version distributions.  The current 
OSSTMM (2.2) has more or less the same contents as the one released 
three years back (2.0).

esn't it sound strange to you that 3.0 is not yet in a "releasable" 
state and, at the same time, ISECOM has been (since 2004) providing 
"OSSTMM 3.0 Certification classes"? (for OPST and OPSA)


Other projects which have turned "commercial" (which is not a bad thing 
in and of itself) have done it wrong and have taken similar steps to try 
to close access to contents they produce and control the 
commercialisation (sp?) of their work. Eventually, all of them have 
turned into non-open-source projects and the community that started 
helping them out eventually left for greener pastures.

Of course, that's my point of view. I'm biased, and do have an emotional 
standpoint here.

I've made my share of contributions to the OSSTMM, reviewing, providing 
content and translations (for the website and the texts). I even 
contributed a full "XML security module" (for SOAP testing) back in 2002 
which has yet to be made public and I'm pretty sure it's part of the 
contents of 3.0 (promised to be released in 2004). I finally left the 
project when it started taking a route I did not like (and I'm not alone 
in this decission). Neither me nor many other previous contributors are 
credited any longer in recent versions of the manuals even if the text 
we contributed is still (verbatim) there.

Friendly,

Javier

PS: Feel free to show me wrong in any of the above statements. Maybe the 
project has taken a different route differently and I've missed it.

No can't do. Document licenses of both projects are completely
incompatible.

OWASP uses the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 which is
incompatible with the CC Creative Commons 2.5
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs used by ISECOM (the later being more
restricted).

Actually, OWASP license is (now [1]) even incompatible with ISSAF's GFDL
license so no text sharing can be done between any of those documents.
At most, ideas can be shared (if rewritten and with due credit).

Regards

Javier

[1] Previous versions of the OWASP documents used the
GFDL license. I've never seen the reasoning behind the license change.
Anyone care to point me to it?

Please, Javier... Citation and reference are ALWAYS possible, in  
EVERY LICENSE and EVERY MATTER.

Let's not fall into the Zealot Paradigm before time. We CAN cite and  
if needed we can have a FORMAL right to cite.
And please take in account that sharing content IS possible even with  
PROPRIETARY license. You only need _permission_ to do that and I can  
bet that we will HAVE permission to do that...

Sorry for being this few idealistic but I'd really like to see the  
day in which we'll do somenting that FUNCTION and IS USEFUL without  
shouting at eachother...

BTW, mine was a SUGGESTION, not a leap of faith required... You can  
ignore me without any problem ;)

rage? me? pfft you haven't met me yet, i rarely get angry.

All i was saying was that OWASP and the OSSTM have different  
ideologies. As it was just pointed out, they use the term open source  
very very very loosely.
If it was open source, why can i not get hold of a copy of the RC  
beta for version 3 right now and look at it?

Sorry if you thought i was angry, it was totally the opposite and  
called sarcasm :0)

Personally i want to stay FAR away from OSSTM and since 2001, we have  
never joined forces and worked with Pete

I'm not that good as a MIM... May I forward the mail to Pete and have

My question to Pete is this:

If the project is truly open source, why are people required to pay  
to access beta code? What happens to the rights of the contributors  
to those sections that are being sold?

I'm a OSSTMM 3.0 OPST since 2004: providing certification on a version
that's not been released yet (now, 2007) really doesn't make any sense,
and only contributed to hurt ISECOM reputation, IHMO.

At the time, 3.0 should have brought brand new metrics (RAV), but many,
even paying subscribers, are still waiting.

Hi,
I would prefer if you talked to Pete off line and then came back to us.
I dont think it is fair to have an audience for him.

Regardless of this, references in the guide are ok. That should cover it.

Dinis, you opened a can of worms here :)

Couple points:

   - Daniel is indeed a great guy, who never gets angry, lives in
   Thailand (moved from London) and checks his emails between Thai massages,
   swims on the see and big walks on the local Forrest. So take his comments
   with a pinch of salt.

   - A note to recent OWASP members in this list: the older OWASP members
   still have hard feelings on ISECOM's (and pete's) actions 5 years ago
   when they/he 'closed' what was before open (or perceived to be Open)
   material. I wasn't involved with OWASP at the time, but if you want more
   information I am sure they can be disclosed.
      - I don't know the details, but I am sure that ISECOM 'closure'
      might have been a benign attempt to generate revenue to pay for
time to be
      spend time on ISECOM projects. I'm very glad that OWASP didn't
      decide to go down that 'closure' path and I am very proud to say that
      (despite everything being available for free) OWASP's is today in a
      reasonable good financial position (which is how we are able to fund
      projects like the OWASP Autumn Of Code
2006<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Autumn_Of_Code_2006>(see
OWASP
      Autumn of Code 2006 -
Selection<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Selection>for
the list of projects sponsored). And before you ask, yes we will
release
      soon the OWASP 2006 Financial accounts

      - Regarding the review of OSSTMM in the OWASP Testing Guide, I
   was not talking about grabbing content from it! (The guide is already big
   enough, and we don't need to copy and paste material from elsewhere
(especially
   in cases like this where there is licence conflicts)). I am just after an
   honest review of what they have there (which will benefit our readers) in
   the same way we do make references to books

   - Regarding Javier's question below on whether he can forward this
   thread to Pete, the answer has to be yes, since the archives of these lists
   are publicly available in our lists.owasp.org website:
      - http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2007-January/ -
      this months archive
      - [Owasp-testing] OSSTMM
manual<http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2007-January/001349.html>-
this thread :)

      - Finally ISECOM lack of momentum (when compared with OWASP)
   should be a very sharp reminder to anybody who thinks that OWASP's materials
   should be closed in any way of form. I am for 99,9% disclosure of everything
   OWASP related (the 0.1% covers for admin passwords and bank account details
   which we are NOT posting on the WIKI :)  ), and I do strongly believe that
   OWASP's openness and integrity are its most valuable assets

Calm down, Calm down, you are starting to sound like me :)
We can refer to the OSSTMM guide in the references as we do other documents.
In the next release 2.1 we can look at what is "best of breed" out there and
get some ideas.
We referr to books in OWASP which have to be purchased so there is no
problem is referring to this guide, open source or not.
But, lets not rely on another guide to do our bidding,
If we think we are missing a section or chapter we shall simply do research
(if required) and write one.

The CC Attribution Share-Alike (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) was designed by Lawrence Lessig precisely for wiki content.  The basic idea is that you can reference the material to the licensor without having to attribute back to all of the original authors (which could be very difficult).

It suits our work at OWASP very well. The GFDL is large and complex and wasn't really designed for a wiki (see http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?FreeDocumentationLicense).

Hi,
IMHO:

1) OWASP and OSSTMM are complementary: the first focuses on Web
Application Security, the second focuses on System and Network
Security.
I agree with Eoin, the Testing Guide is more practical.
As you can see in the attachment (I don't know if that will be
eliminated by the mail server), Raoul Chiesa and I talked about that
at the IDC Banking Forum 2005.

2) OSSTMM cites OWASP in their methodology for the Web Application
Security field because it doesn't go deeply into this argument.

3) ISSAF is similar to our Testing Guide, but once again this is not
totally focused on Web Application Security and the approach is
different.
http://www.oissg.org/component/option,com_docman/task,cat_view/gid,66/Itemid,134/

4) Testing Guide Version 2.1
As PDP has suggested me, I'd like to create a new chapter on Client
side Testing: flash, java, ecc...nowadays Web 2.0 moves a part of the
application on the client side.

I agree we should have a better framework for analyzing code for simple
issues.  LAPSE is interesting, but is really a one-trick pony.  LAPSE
does source-to-sink dataflow analysis, so it's pretty good for analyzing
things like SQL injection and XSS.  But it has no ability to analyze
encryption, logging, access control, authentication, error handling,
concurrency, etc... And it only works on Java.

 

I think "most issues should be detectable" is too aggressive (I've done
quite a lot of work in this space).  That's what the commercial static
analysis tool vendors are trying to do.  I suggest we focus on tools
that assist the manual code reviewer, and DO NOT try to find problems
automatically.

 

For example, a tool that finds and flags all the encryption code is easy
and valuable.  Maybe it helps me navigate the code with "security
goggles" on.  A tool that attempts to analyze the encryption code and
determine if it is sound is ridiculously hard and will have lots of
false alarms.

 

The tool must have some compiler-like features - at least symbol
resolution, because grep is too inaccurate.

Here there is.
Please, take in account that there are PETE ideas ;)

I agree that any source-code analysis tool will have limitations (and in
fact KNOWing what those limitations are is as important as the limitations
itself).

BUT since we are talking here about source-code-review guidelines, where
there is a 'guideline' about something to look at, I think that most of
those 'look for this' actions can be automated. In most cases the
code-automation tool will just a grep on steroids where it only indicates
'areas to look at and review', but in others (specially in VM based
languages like .Net and Java) it should be able to provide better results.

I agree with the compiler concept, and in .Net and Java I would also use the
'sandbox' paradigm where code that is able to be executed in 'safe'
sandboxes can be automatically considered to be 'safe from a series of
vulnerabilities.

I think all I am saying is that with the current focus on the Code Review
project it would be a great opportunity to co-develop such
code-auditing-tool (which 99% of current developers desperately need). And
for the technical difficulties of implementing such tool, If I can, I will
be very active in resolving them

*EK:*
*Agreed, I believe we should start in a basic manner. Even if this means
writing a rule-set based on OWASP guide best practice. This would be akin to
CIS guidelines and assocuiated tools.*


I agree with the compiler concept, and in .Net and Java I would also use the

*EK:*
*Sandboxing is great, believe me, but I dont think sandboxking can excuse
bad design of code implementation.*

*EK:*
*Totally agree and is a very important too. as it was mentioned before that
a group such as OWASP has many Pen test tools but not so many secure
application development  tools.*
**
*My chosen  avenue would be a "Grep on Steroids" (Static code analysis)
initially. But  we should consider as part oft he roadmap to include dynamic
code analysis (Much more difficult). And also start with Java but design the
tool to be extensible so we could include C#, C++ etc in the future.*

That image is actually a good one, can you put a variation of it on the
guide?

It also shows exactly why there should some references to the OSSTMM in the
Guide

Jeff,

is it possible for us to re-license the OWASP Guide 3.0 with this  
license, or do I have to find all the 1.x contributors and ask them  
for permission?

thanks
Andrew

I collaborated in the ISSAF 0.2.1. I don't know if Javier has contacted
with them, but it might begin the connection. What seems to you (Javier,
Dinis, etc.etc.)?

I'm not going to answer point by point, specially since Pete is not on 
the list (and not CC'ed) and I don't want to enter and endless debate.

Suffice it to say that I have been maintaining free (as in speech) 
documentation like the "Debian Securing Manual" for over 5 years. All of 
it's completely GPLd, and my position on open source documentation is 
that I don't care if people make money out of it, rehash it for some 
other Debian-derived distribution (like Ubuntu), fork it, put it in a 
book or even throw it to the wastebasket. Actually, if others profit 
from my work it's ok for me as long as I'm credited. I didn't get into 
this for the money.

And I do work in the IT security industry and have hardened a number of 
systems (both Debian, other Unices and Windows). I'm very much aware of 
the commercial value of an operating system's in-depth security manual 
(as long as it has a big user base, which Debian certainly has).

Regards

Javier

Hello everybody. Sorry, I am just reading this now.

Well, I am all for pushing LAPSE further. I basically think about
LAPSE as a straw man project in terms of the technology it uses.
Dinis, I think you need to explain what you are proposing.

Various injection issues (or at least their sinks) are easy to spot.
In fact, LAPSE does that already. Code analysis for race detection is
considerably more complex. Some of the more architectural issues
mentioned in the code review guide and not exactly connected to the
code.

So, what exactly is being proposed?

Best,
-Ben

Hi,

The image is over-simplified.  There are applications for services that are 
not on the web: ie, for finger, dns, ldap, smtp, pop, etc. for which the 
OSSTMM does have tests for.  It should say "web applications" right?

I reviewed some of the content in the earlier versions, but time 
restrictions prevented me from really being a contributor. If you have 
worked with them I think you would be a better contact than myself.

Of course, cross-citation would be OK, just like we already do with 
useful guides and whitepapers out there. But copy & paste (as some 
suggested) would not.

A license change requires all people with copyright over the text to 
approve it (that approval needs to be signed to be legal). All document 
authors are actually copyright holders of the text they wrote unless 
they transfer (c) to some other organisation beforehand (and typically 
this needs to be also signed for it to be legal under most jurisdictions).

That's why many projects, right from the start, ask contributors to 
either adhere to a license that they don't expect to change, or transfer 
(c) to the main leader of the project. This is, IIRC, done now when 
people sign in the Wiki but was not done previously in OWASP.

That's also why having a version control system (even for documentation) 
where people contribute makes it easier to determine who wrote what. 
Without it is impossible to track who made significant changes to the 
document (and is, consequently, co-author of it).

Of course, this does not apply to small "patches" to the documents (typo 
fixes, reviews, ideas that get written by somebody else) since those are 
not major contributions.

Some (OSS) projects have had to rewrite some parts full of it because 
they could not get hold of one of the earlier contributors when they 
wanted to do a license change :(

Seeing the problems of licenses and your experience in this, I believe
that in these moments you are the most suitable contact. Nevertheless,
if you need any help, say it to me.

I think this would be a great step forward in code security. I could
image that a tool of this nature would let me flag blocks of code to fit
in a certain security category (input validation, encryption, auth, etc)
and color-code it in some way.

Also, I could as an auditor set a master list of concepts that I need to
search for in my manual audit, add audit-specific notations to code, and
perhaps give me a checklist of concepts I need to "check off" for every
jsp and servlet. Perhaps a flag to mark certain code as questionable, or
needs further review.... Perhaps a comment layer so a team of auditors
could collaborate on the code review/audit process.

Most of the commercial products out there that claim to be an Audit
Workbench are really only static analysis tools, nothing I see out there
really assists me with the manual code review process.

Ok, so we all agree that we need a tool to aid the manual code review
process.

Who is going to help?

We already have two OWASP projects that are trying to tackle this
problem (OWASP
LAPSE Project <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_LAPSE_Project>and
OWASP
Orizon Project<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Orizon_Project>)
so who wants to colaborate can either join these projects or start a new
project

My understanding is that both of those products are
static-code-analyzers and not manual code review helpers. We are talking
about apples and oranges here.

I would say we are talking about fruit here :)   (so both apples and oranges
are OK :)  )

Yes these tools don't have everything that we would be expecting from a
manual code review helper tool, BUT you would be crazy to implement such
tool (manual code review helper) and not use the capabilities of
static-code-analyzers (and even run-time analyzers) to identify a series of
issues that those tools are very efficient at finding.

And there is no harm in having a separate OWASP project is implementing our
Grep-on-steroids

Hi Jeff,
that's a great news!
As Dinis said before, why don't we add a section of the Guide in which
we add these great  comments?
I think your presentation is very impressive: I'm completing my
presentation for ISACA Rome next 25th in a few hours, so I will

Hi,

 

Just wanted to let you know that the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) and others are actively looking at the Testing Guide.  They asked
me (last minute) to talk about it at one of their SwA working group
meetings.

Here is the presentation I gave.

 

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Testing_Guide_Presentation.z
ip

 

It talks briefly about the Testing Guide, and then goes on to discuss
the broader issues related to HOW we build a body of knowledge about
application security, the OWASP approach, and why the traditional
approaches are doomed.  I hope you like it.

 

Please forward me any feedback you have on the presentation, as I'm sure
it's not the last time.

The Static code analyzer approach would be a good place to start.
This would simply point to areas in code where potential vulns may occur.

I used a static code analyzer for years based on reg-ex and checkstyle
and it speeds up the code review process greatly which is what the tool is
meant to do.
(my opinions relate to a number of years of actually running a code review
team and  hence the idea of starting the code review guide.)
So should this be a separate project, part of the Lapse project (why are we
not using this?).?

If it is to be part of the Code Review Project I think that....
I really would like to focus on the document in order for it to be a base
for the code review tool checks. (makes logical sense). No point in having a
tool that checks for X but the guide does not cover X.

Also in the world of OOD can we not reuse LAPSE or other tools out there
already ;)

Yep, having it detached from an IDE (like eclipse/WSAD...) is better for me.
Can you send the intrested parties an overview on Orizon so
1. We know what is involved.
2. See if its suitable
3. Get a roadmap together and a plan of action.

Hi,

 

Just wanted to let you know that the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) and others are actively looking at the Testing Guide.  They asked
me (last minute) to talk about it at one of their SwA working group
meetings.

> Technology, Tools and Product Evaluation Working Group)

> are wondering if you would be interested in presenting the Testing

> Annapolis Junction) on Monday January 22.

 

Here is the presentation I gave.

 

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Testing_Guide_Presentation.z
ip

 

It talks briefly about the Testing Guide, and then goes on to discuss
the broader issues related to HOW we build a body of knowledge about
application security, the OWASP approach, and why the traditional
approaches are doomed.  I hope you like it.

 

Please forward me any feedback you have on the presentation, as I'm sure
it's not the last time.

Jim you're right for the 50%. Orizon will be a dynamic code review tool too.
I'm planning to extract methods, C functions and build on the fly a test
program that stress the aformentioned method or function using an user
supplied input :)

Orizon is born to be a framework for people who wants to build a code review
tool. Indeed is itself a tool but it's main goal is to provide a set fo API.
Orizon's approach is different from LAPSE one.
Orizon doesn't rely onto eclipse for parsing java sources. It translate
source file (Java, C# and in future others) into XML and applies XML checks
over the translated source.

In fact in the part of code review guide I'll contribute to write I'll use
experience I'm gathering writing Orizon :)

Again, since I'm mainly writing a framework not just a standalone tool and
since I'm involved as you know in Code Review Project too, I'm ok to write
Orizon to cover aspects that will come in our Code Review Guide :)
This is in a very early development stage.. so I can make it grow as I want
(and, IMHO very important in an indipendent way from any IDE both opensource
than closed)

Sure.
Orizon borns in the late of september when I was collecting info and tools
to an italian speech I took for Owasp Italy chapter @ eAcademy (inside the
SMAU expo, http://www.smau.it/) in Milan. The speech was about application
security and code review.
I realized the importance about dynamic code review combined with static
pattern matching approach. I realized too that a dynamic approach needs a
sort of automatization, also if not all part of code review process could be
automatizated (and all of us we're happy about this).
I found a list of tools both opensource than closed like pdm, lapse,
fortify, flawfinder, rats. Wondering about these tools I realized that they
don't share information among them and sometimes they are also tied to the
environment used to write software.

The security checks not to be shared between tools arises me that there
would be the need of a sort of library, or a framework in which code
reviewer experience in writing tests will be translated in some way and
available to anyone who want to write a code review tool.

So I started planning Orizon with the idea to create an infrastructure, a
sort of code review engine usable by anyone who want to create a code
scanning tool. So Orizon greatest value will be the security check library
written by experts (we, guys @ owasp :)) and available to anyone's tool.
Orizon of course will be a tool using itself as framework (like a demo).
Orizon will be a tool not tied to IDE, so I started by now a command line
tool.

For static analysis Orizon won't be tied to programming language. That's
because I'll translate source code to be checked, in XML (by now only java
works but I'm planning to extend translation list to C#, C and other). Over
XML security checks (written in XML too) will be applied in a pattern
matching fashion.
In the architectural document (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:Orizon_internal_draft.doc) I planned a
sort of style check but this part needs further engineering over it.

For dynamic analysis Orizon will (better, it aims to):
* disassemble class or source in methods or functions
* create simple test tools that invokes method or function to be checked
supplying an input that in a first project stage will be created by reviewer
(I'm reading something about fuzzy logic and I'd like to implement something
but in a future)
* prints out unhandled exceptions, strange behaviour, ...

Of course results validation is an human task and demanded to reviewer.

By now I'm focused create the static part of the framework. I'll plan to
have something usable in the late spring (may 2007).

I'm planning to add also dynamic review in the summer and having something
full available next fall (maybe for the next AoC).

This is the old Orizon web site @ sourceforge:
http://orizon.sourceforge.net/
Sourceforge hosts SVN source repository.

This is the Owasp Orizon main page:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Orizon_Project
with mailing list reference.
At today 10 people are subscribed to mailing list but it generates very few
traffic but I think that's because the lack of fresh commits...

This is the Owasp Orizon Blog: blogs.owasp.org/orizon

Please everyone feel itself free to forward this overview to anyone he
thinks could interested on Orizon and please forgive me for my very bad
english :)

Tell me if this overview fullfills your questions or there is something more
you want to know :)
