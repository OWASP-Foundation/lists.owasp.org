Yes, Friday is fine. It's only 48 pages.
 
If I have specific comments for particular authors to understand what they've written, I would post to the testing list?
 
thanks,
Andrew

	That is so awesome. I would really like to be able to get this out later this week (before end of month) as we have long promised.
	
	The main challenge is that Chapter 4 doesn't fit from a grammatical, length or content perspective.
	
	The aim of this Part 1 is to be the What, Why, When, Where of Tetsing with Part 2 being the How. Ie aprt from the Testing Framework we should just be introducing concepts, techniques and ideas. Part 2 will cover details HOw To's.
	
	Could we get an updated draft by Friday ?

Hi all

I apologize for not having a new draft update by Friday but It was deadly at work, even today I'll be having trouble to start writing.

I have not gotten any guidance/feedback yet on last draft sent by Mark to the list, could you please send me your thoughts/comments so I can take them in account when I start working on the guide tomorrow (and through the week)?? (white box section please)

I need much help on it, any comment will be welcomed.

Thanks in advance

Juan,

I am sorry if I didnt communicate this well but the content as is was sent to Andrew Van Der Stock for editing. At this point we need to have a cut off otherwize we will never get this out. 

I do think this is a good time to start work on Part 2 while Part 1 gets dusted. Anyone have any strong thoughts or any initial work they would like considered ?

Subject: Draft 0.5

 

Hi there,

 

I've "finished" several passes of editing 0.44. There are significant
changes to some text, little in other places.

 

The minor changes are:

 

*	spelling mistakes should very nearly be gone
*	grammar is fixed in most areas
*	Fixed up template hell. There's one template hell left (you'll spot
it). 
*	verbal dribble has been minimized, sometimes ruthlessly. Please
don't take it personally. There's more to come, particularly towards the end
of the document

 

There are some minor quibbles with the written English remaining in the
draft. 

 

Tense: are we going non-passive? I hope so. If so, we need to eliminate past
tense and passive voice unless we really are talking about something that
happened in the past. 

 

Sexist language. There is no excuse for using "he" and other masculine
pronouns in this day and age. We'll be caned for it. Can I respectfully ask
the author(s) of the section who used "he" throughout their section to have
a shot at re-wording every paragraph without it? Use "the attacker" or
similar instead.

 

Pronouns, "us" "we", "you" "your", etc. This is either a formal document, in
which case pronoun usage is eliminated, or this is a chatty document, in
which case, we ensure all the text is like that. Can I have some feeling
about which way to go?

 

There are major structural changes I think need to be undertaken, but I want
to consult here prior to making them. Nearly every chapter wants to define
how to do their little part, and there's a lot of overlap between the
chapters and material which is covered (in some cases much better) elsewhere
in the OWASP universe. I think this document should be hard core about how
to define and benchmark a testing framework, not detail the Penetration Test
Checklist or repeat sections better handled by the Guide. There's obviously
been a great deal of work here, and I don't want to see it lost, but it
would help the readability and focus immeasurably if a lot of the repetitive
content is amalgamated and each section closely follow the scope set out in
the first chapter.

Thanks to some wonderful help from Jeff and Andrew we now have Draft 6
which hopefully is normalized somewhat. I will be completing the final
sections over the next few days and hopefully we will have a final
releasable product very, very soon.

Mark, thanks for incorporating the changes. There's a fair amount to be done
- good luck with that. It's Mother's Day this weekend so I will have
somewhat limited time, but when you need another edit, let me know as early
as possible. 

 

Who wants to be the bunny to find a safe strcpy()? I think it might be
advantageous to ask Michael Howard if we can gain permission to use the
source from his excellent strsafe.h MSDN article, as a) it points out a
previous attempt at a safe strcpy. which failed and b) it presents a nice
alternative which I have used with some success in a managed C++ application
for work. 

 

http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncode/h
tml/secure03102004.asp

 

Alternatively, the *BSDs have various safe(r) str*() functions which we may
wish to use, with attribution. 

 

Jeff, I love your new section. Exactly what was needed whilst being clear
and concise. 

 

Thanks,

Andrew

A couple of Q's:

Where does testing at owasp.org goto?
Credits, would it be easier to dump everyone's name somewhere as i can see it getting
messy when future editions come
out (or am i being mad?)

The source code review section is looking much healthier

The web application scanners thing is a good addition, ive also started a review process
for the Bank im at with regards
to how useful/crap they are. Should we make this section more detailed or wait until the
OWASP benchmark process gets
released?

Also on tools - I think SoftICE and the other reverse engineering tools,
such as jode, rate a mention. 

Does anyone have a session cryptography analyzer? I tend to just grab 10,000
session IDs and work with it in Excel, plotting graphs against time (good
for monotonically increasing session handlers) and working out if there's a
statistical correlation (such as a bunching or mean), but I always felt this
takes far too long. 

My personal opinion is a final opinion should wait until the benchmark
process is completed... Saying that, I use them only to find the low hanging
fruit, as they simply don't get most of the juicy stuff.

Thanks,
Andrew

thing is, we all know how bad they are, but the marketing droids are bloody good at the
whole process of big'ing them up

If we did include a detailed section, it would really help people cut through the FUD and
get the real lowdown

A guy at Foundstone has started building a session analyzer that we will
release as freeware. 

Agree on the benchmarking. Jeff, where did this go with Cerias ?

Message-ID: <7274FE6068F1DE49B8AA0258E92C5A3C018C2C8F@shasta.foundstone.com>

If Cerias won't do the benchmark I will build it myself in August /
Sept. I have been thinking about it a lot and have a good idea on what
it will look like. There is also a potential private sponsor for this.

If we did include a detailed section, it would really help people cut
through the FUD and
get the real lowdown

Wow!
 
The white box section looks great!, sadly every moment I realize about my limitations in writing "serious" English, no mater my enthusiasm to contribute.
 
kudos to Andrew and Mark for this transformation. and thanks overall.
 
Best regards
JC
 
PS don't worry, I'm disappointed about this, but still here to provide my two cents.

Mark,

   I'm in the middle of editing through this version of the draft for
language and grammar and such.  I'll try and have it out in the next day
or two before I leave on vacation.  I'm glad I've finally got the go
ahead to start work on helping with the OWASP projects.  Hope that my

That's excellent. In that case I will not complete any sections that are missing or need finishing such as principles. If you want to feel free to add to those sections, if not I will pick up where you leave off. Having seen the quality of your docs Larry, take a totally free hand at this !

Right now I'm just editing for language, not adding content of any kind.  (Being new into the process, and knowing that you're up against a deadline, I wasn't going to try and jump in on adding content for this revision).  I've got revision control on while I edit, and I've added a few comment balloons for someone to review.

Juan Carlos,

 

Please don't take my comments / editing personally - if I could write any
language other than English even half as well as you do, I'd be very happy.
Please don't stop contributing - write whenever you can - when I could speak
French fluently, the only way I could improve my diction, accent, grammar
and vocab was to continue to use it. Unfortunately, I don't speak to many
French speakers here in Australia, so over the last 15 years I've lost
nearly all of my ability to speak or write French (although I can still
understand it okay). 

 

I have friends are actual editors, and I've seen the galleys of some pretty
famous books (like Feersum Endjinn by Iain Banks), and the typos, spelling
mistakes and grammar mistakes are there too. That's what editors are there
for - to make your ideas and prose come to the fore. It is a collaboration
of peers to create the best possible work from raw ideas. 

 

I suggest Lyn Dupre's excellent book for anyone who writes for a living or
performs technical editing / QA for others: 

 

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020137921X/102-8911386-5592122
?v=glance

 

(Obviously, she writes for US English, but it works for near dialects such
as Australian and British English, too).

 

Thanks,

Andrew

Wow!

 

The white box section looks great!, sadly every moment I realize about my
limitations in writing "serious" English, no mater my enthusiasm to
contribute.

 

kudos to Andrew and Mark for this transformation. and thanks overall.

 

Best regards

PS don't worry, I'm disappointed about this, but still here to provide my
two cents.

Thanks to some wonderful help from Jeff and Andrew we now have Draft 6 which hopefully is normalized somewhat. I will be completing the final sections over the next few days and hopefully we will have a final releasable product very, very soon. 

 

Cheers,

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Contradictions in PenTest list
Message-ID: <409A27FE.903@dawes.za.net>

Hi folks,

i was working through the items in the pen-test list, and ran across the 
following contradiction:

OWASP-AD-002 Application Lockout

Ensure that the application does not allow an attacker to reset or lock 
out users accounts.

and

OWASP-AUTHN-007 Password lockout

Ensure that the user's account is locked out for a period of time when 
the incorrect password is entered more than a speciifc number of times.

Seems to me you can have either/or, but not both.

I would be inclined to remove OWASP-AD-002, because it should really be 
covered by OWASP-AUTHN-004 (non-trivial/wallet usernames) and 
OWASP-AUTHN-008 (login and recovery process does not allow for user 
enumeration).

Thoughts?

Rogan

Yeah I erally want to get our own mail setup...I think we have a possible sponsor for some new boxes so I suspect one more and a Java mail manager and we can integrate it into the portal....

2 is the hands on technical stuff...how do you find SQL injection step by step from pen testing to code review as an example.

Good catch sir. There are a few other tweaks I noticed as well like the reference to NIST 800-30 missing etc.

So the things we wrote last year related to different tests and how to 
do it are going to be there in part 2? I will present the current 
draft to the programming teams at my company in two weeks time (I have 
first to make a presentation related to it) Hopefully I will be able 
to provide comments on the current draft at that time.

Regards

Javier

oh good point, where are all those sections we all did?

i think we do need to hammer out the TOC first, coz i can see a good debate on what
happens when and how and what to include

on a side note, how many of us are heading to the conference? I have my best friends
wedding that weekend but DO want to
hookup with everyone to put a face to the names

Andrew,

Here are couple of question from my side with respect to your comments. 

1. On Page No 17, you highlighted the first line of "What is Inspection?"
section. There is no comment for that. Why did you comment it? 

2. On Page No 22, regarding the Test Plan, do you want me to elaborate the
structure of test plan. This would unnecessarily increase the content of the
document and might deviate from the core of the doc. What do you say? If you
want, I can give more details on the same.

Do clarify and I shall update the document immediately.

Harinath,

Page 17 - I used yellow and forgot to say, "Include reference".  I want all
the books and anything referencable to end up with ALA citations at the
back, and the yellow is a way for me to remember to come back and fill that
in, so that citations within the text will end up like "... Boris Belzier in
his book Software Testing Techniques [BELZIER01], a knowledgeable ..." 

Page 22. Most test plans (when they exist) I see are drawn from business,
technical and user requirements and are typically just Excel spreadsheets.
Sometimes they are just e-mails of things that went wrong with the last
build. Rarely do they have even minor sanity / desk-checking / assertion /
boundary checks or security tests included. In this instance, I agree that
it is a huge area to cover, and maybe it might be better to point people who
are interested in writing comprehensive and useful test plans to a
reference. Which would you suggest?

Thanks,
Andrew

Don't worry I'm still in (as I said in my PS) and enthusiastic, just had a rude wake up.  :)
 
Thanks for the support,

JC,
 
Please don't take anything personally. All contributions wind up getting heaviy edited including (especially) mine so that the docs read with a common voice and have a common depth and style. I know when this is complete we can all look at it and be proud we contributed.

Juan Carlos,

 

Please don?t take my comments / editing personally ? if I could write any language other than English even half as well as you do, I?d be very happy. Please don?t stop contributing ? write whenever you can ? when I could speak French fluently, the only way I could improve my diction, accent, grammar and vocab was to continue to use it. Unfortunately, I don?t speak to many French speakers here in Australia, so over the last 15 years I?ve lost nearly all of my ability to speak or write French (although I can still understand it okay). 

 

I have friends are actual editors, and I?ve seen the galleys of some pretty famous books (like Feersum Endjinn by Iain Banks), and the typos, spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes are there too. That?s what editors are there for ? to make your ideas and prose come to the fore. It is a collaboration of peers to create the best possible work from raw ideas. 

 

I suggest Lyn Dupre?s excellent book for anyone who writes for a living or performs technical editing / QA for others: 

 

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020137921X/102-8911386-5592122?v=glance

 

(Obviously, she writes for US English, but it works for near dialects such as Australian and British English, too).

 

Thanks,

Andrew

Wow!

 

The white box section looks great!, sadly every moment I realize about my limitations in writing "serious" English, no mater my enthusiasm to contribute.

 

kudos to Andrew and Mark for this transformation. and thanks overall.

 

Best regards

JC

 

PS don't worry, I'm disappointed about this, but still here to provide my two cents.

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Thoughts on the Pen test checklist
Message-ID: <E1BNCvX-0008Ll-2F@sc8-sf-mx2.sourceforge.net>

HI guys,

 

I've now bench tested the Pen Test draft checklist three times in my work
(we do a lot of short pen tests . 3-5 days). I've got a few notes for your
consideration for the final.

 

The work flow chart needs a little more regarding infrastructure information
gathering. I know it is an application level document, but it is useful to
either detail a reference to a good network pentest guide, or provide a
little guidance on using certain tools and techniques to gather adequate
information about the environment that the application runs atop. I always
like to have a good map of where my victims lay, so I try firewalk and hping
and ftp bounce attacks if I can to detail the behind the firewall view.

 

For example, in 1999, I pen tested a finance reporting app, which I
initially broke into by using broadcast ping sweep to find the app servers,
followed by using a sniffer to get some usernames and passwords. Once I had
a working credential, not only did the app lift its skirts and expose last
week's dirty laundry, it was eye opening how much more fun you could have
with a little credentialed access. 

 

Back to the checklist.

 

I think I spent a little too much time on the authentication area's
parameter manipulation the first time I used it, as I mistook this task as
an invitation to perform as much parameter manipulation as possible. I tend
to find it is easier to spider the entire app as I know it, and then have a
go at parameter manipulation first, and then play with session handling and
authentication once I have some decent bookmarked URLs to muck around with.
I also tend to re-spider when I know there's Javascript HREFs coming into
play, as pretty much every single spider program out there can't work out JS
popups and so on. I'm thinking that it may make more sense to detail a few
attack trees and then provide the checklist in this order, walking the
attack tree in a logical order which builds atop previous work. Starting
with authentication in this instance may make sense, but we may also wish to
wait for the data validation / parameter manipulation section before
attacking the authentication and session management parameters. 

 

The checklist misses default accounts. These are rich sources of fun and
profit, especially for well-known applications and LDAP based authentication
schemes.

 

I also like to have a go at using common paths. like /admin/, /images/ and
/backup/ just to see if there's anything there. This is not mentioned as far
as I can tell, but it's a good one to try if you don't know much about the
application.

 

Also, configuration is not mentioned nearly enough*. Everyone knows (well,
actually, they don't) that you should check for snoop.jsp / (various)Spy.jsp
and so on in J2EE environments to find out what is chewing juice and to
occasionally enumerate loaded modules. Each language and many authoring
solutions tend to stick to a few well worn patterns. The pentest document
should note this. 

 

Thanks,

Andrew

 

* In the last review using this checklist, I couldn't initially break into
the application because the authentication page was nice and robust. Shame
about the operating system not being patched and the web application server
being misconfigured.

I have a webinar next week on this so was hoping we would at least have
a first draft by then. Let me run through the updates you have made so
far tonight and then maybe we can figure out a timeline for the rest.
Seem like a plan ?

Also on tools - I think SoftICE and the other reverse engineering tools,
such as jode, rate a mention.

Does anyone have a session cryptography analyzer? I tend to just grab
10,000
session IDs and work with it in Excel, plotting graphs against time
(good
for monotonically increasing session handlers) and working out if
there's a
statistical correlation (such as a bunching or mean), but I always felt
this
takes far too long.

My personal opinion is a final opinion should wait until the benchmark
process is completed... Saying that, I use them only to find the low
hanging
fruit, as they simply don't get most of the juicy stuff.

Thanks,
Andrew

Looking good :0)

A couple of Q's:

Where does testing at owasp.org goto?
Credits, would it be easier to dump everyone's name somewhere as i can
see
it getting
messy when future editions come
out (or am i being mad?)

The source code review section is looking much healthier

The web application scanners thing is a good addition, ive also started
a
review process
for the Bank im at with regards
to how useful/crap they are. Should we make this section more detailed
or
wait until the
OWASP benchmark process gets
released?

 <<OWASP Testing Project v06.doc>> I read through all of the edits and
comments. Great stuff, Larry and Andrew and Jeff and everyone else. 

I accepted all edits to date. I have not addressed the comments so far.
I also need to complete the sections that have gaps. 

Larry's employer has very generouisly volunteered to have a professional
tech writer look at this after Larry's final edits which is excellent.
This will be a very professional document when completed. 

I wonder if this schedule works for everyone. 

This week
Mark to finish incomplete sections

Next Week
Larry to make final edits
Everyone to address comments

Week After
Professional Tech Editor

Week After 
Release

I have a long standing web cast next week on this project though Global
Knowledge (few hundred signed up) so will use the current draft and
point people towards a final download date of 3 weeks time.

I agree with the majority of comments, especially the comment about the legality of doing
application tests. 
Since this guide will be viewed in a variety of different legal environments, maybe we
should just list something that
says "check your local legal requirements"

the one thing i'd hate to get into is the legal side of things.

Other than that, its finally coming along.
Maybe we can draw up a list of what needs to be done so we can get it ready for the proper
technical review?

Hi All,

I sincerely apologize for all the delay from my side. I request all of you
who have given feedback for the subject matter to just hold on and I shall
send the updated doc by tomorrow night. 

Mark,

I am extremely sorry for the delay (Please don't think that this is a
regular excuse, but I am really struck with things out here.) I shall
definitely send you the updated doc by the weekend. 

Also, I am game for the Part II. Even though I am running around, I want to
sincerely work with the team.

Hari

There is no updated doc to this. You can send comments but please dont update anything. This is the master doc which has been reviewed by two editors and we cant start that process again or we will never finish. No changes will be accepted at thios stage. There has been plenty of time for that. 

If you want to send comments, either embed them in the doc or as a seperate email. 

Thanks

Mark

Mark,

    I've continued my editing and have gotten further... still have a
bit more to go.  Problem is after tonight, I'm on vacation and will be
touring around the England countryside for the next week and likely
won't have much chance to continue my edits.  I wouldn't be able to
finish til I get back in the office the week of the 24th.  Also, there
are several places in the document where others and I have added
comments that will need to be answered/addressed/written as well before
you want to turn it over to a tech-writer, as you'll want it as close to
the final version as possible...

-Larry

 <<OWASP Testing Project v06.doc>> I read through all of the edits and
comments. Great stuff, Larry and Andrew and Jeff and everyone else. 

I accepted all edits to date. I have not addressed the comments so far.
I also need to complete the sections that have gaps. 

Larry's employer has very generouisly volunteered to have a professional
tech writer look at this after Larry's final edits which is excellent.
This will be a very professional document when completed. 

I wonder if this schedule works for everyone. 

This week
Mark to finish incomplete sections

Next Week
Larry to make final edits
Everyone to address comments

Week After
Professional Tech Editor

Week After 
Release

I have a long standing web cast next week on this project though Global
Knowledge (few hundred signed up) so will use the current draft and
point people towards a final download date of 3 weeks time.

OK, let me fill in the missing gaps based on the last one I sent out and
then if you can continue your edits based on that final draft on the
24th, we can then hand it off to a tech writer when you are done.

Mark,

    I've continued my editing and have gotten further... still have a
bit more to go.  Problem is after tonight, I'm on vacation and will be
touring around the England countryside for the next week and likely
won't have much chance to continue my edits.  I wouldn't be able to
finish til I get back in the office the week of the 24th.  Also, there
are several places in the document where others and I have added
comments that will need to be answered/addressed/written as well before
you want to turn it over to a tech-writer, as you'll want it as close to
the final version as possible...

-Larry

 <<OWASP Testing Project v06.doc>> I read through all of the edits and
comments. Great stuff, Larry and Andrew and Jeff and everyone else. 

I accepted all edits to date. I have not addressed the comments so far.
I also need to complete the sections that have gaps. 

Larry's employer has very generouisly volunteered to have a professional
tech writer look at this after Larry's final edits which is excellent.
This will be a very professional document when completed. 

I wonder if this schedule works for everyone. 

This week
Mark to finish incomplete sections

Next Week
Larry to make final edits
Everyone to address comments

Week After
Professional Tech Editor

Week After 
Release

I have a long standing web cast next week on this project though Global
Knowledge (few hundred signed up) so will use the current draft and
point people towards a final download date of 3 weeks time.

Due to the sheer amount of boxes being 0wned as we speak, i seriously 
would check the source of all OWASP stuff hosted at sourceforge.

The code below has been floating around for months now, but only in a 
few circles.

Mark, what would we need to do to get our own box for OWASP?
I'm willing to throw some cash at it if needed

IMHO perhaps a chechsum mechanism would help, and sourcefource could be kept.

We actually have a full CMS being integrated on the OWASP portal.
http://www.obinary.com/en/magnolia.html This can be used for content
management evenually and document management whch will mean we will not
need to rely on CVS for documentation projects.  

I am not sure of the latest status but I will check.

Sorry Larry, been a little over worked. 

 

It would be great if you would finish your edits and then I will finish
the sections missing. I have cleared the decks next week to do work like
this whilst in Hawaii (I get all the good trips) so just let me know
when you have finished and I will pick it up.

 

Mark

 

PS take a look at the first of many free Foundstone tools for black box
and manual testing coming up in the next few months.
