Mateo,

Can we update the wiki with a new date as well? I see this question asked on social networks often as well.

Cheers!

Hello Adnan,

The guide is still in the works but it is still a few months away from
an initial draft.  This guide as well as other OWASP projects are
trying to adhere to a more common framework and numbering.  The
following is a roadmap that Matteo has outlined for v4 and we are
working towards it.  Thank you for the email and Matteo will send out
an update when things are further along.

This is the roadmap of v4:
- Create a new comprehensive list of all the possible vulnerabilities.
- Review all the control numbers to adhere to the OWASP Common numbering,
- Review all the sections in v3,
- Create a more readable guide, eliminating some sections that are not
really useful,
- Insert new testing techniques: HTTP Verb tampering, HTTP Parameter
Pollutions, etc.,
- Rationalize some sections as Session Management Testing,
- Debate if create a new section: Client side security and Firefox
extensions testing.

Regards,
Kevin

Thanks kevin for the update, we are anxiously waiting for v4 draft.

The road map provided for v4 is really good, I would also suggest to 
include firefox addones for security testing as its very helpful to 
identify the vulnerabilities.

Adnan

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Checklists for testing guide v4
Message-ID: <AANLkTinFk2yk9JTiwFVwwVFx8OiiujTaSPq_7V3cRMrp@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'm relatively new to this list, so apologies if this has been
discussed to death in the past!

I'd like to see a set of checklists, either as part of the core guide,
or as additional resources.
I understand the various comments in the v3  guide like "Try to avoid
using the guide as a checklist", but I do think that checklists could
be a useful addition to the guide.
I've had a look at pages like:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist, and
http://a4apphack.com/featured/web-appsec-testing-checklist but they
dont quite match what I have in mind.
What I was thinking of was multiple checklists for different levels of
pentesting - eg a novice / 'quick and dirty' test, a medium depth test
and a full fat version.
Ideally these would also be available as html pages which could then
link directly to the relevant pages of the online version of the
guide.
I'd also really like them to be hierarchical, like
http://portswigger.net/wahh/tasks.html :)
They could then be included in tools (like the Zed Attack proxy;)
which could provide integrated checklists, again linking to the guide
contents.
Obviously thats one angle I'm looking at, but I also teach basic pen
testing techniques to functional testers, and for them the testing
guide is quite heavy weight.
A 'quick and dirty' checklist might make it easier for them to get
started with basic security testing.
If such checklists are thought to be useful then I'd be happy to
contribute to them.

Thanks,

Psiinon

Try: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project

It's a little biased towards manual consulting services, but  I still feel it's a solid body of work that addresses what you are asking for (to some degree).

Hi all, I was wondering if is there any draft version of testing guide V4
including OWASP testing checkList.

I am aware significant changes need to be made and I would like to read any
draft version and check it's status as I am trying my company to assume
owasp's testing guide as the de facto methodology for web app testing.

Best regards

Hi Nuno,
thank you for your email.

The stable version of the Testing Guide is v3 and widely adopted worldwide.
As you can read from the email below, we are at the starting phase of
the project v4.
I've presented a draft of the testing checklist at the last Summit, it
will be available soon.
I'd like to finish the first 2 steps of the roadmap, then starting with
the project.
Please keep in touch on the OWASP Testing guide ml: as for version 3 you
can follow the draft pages of project on the wiki.

Thanks,
Best regards,
Mat
