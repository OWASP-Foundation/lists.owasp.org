Subject: [Owasp-testing] [OWASP-Testing] ASVS and Testing Guide
Message-ID: <a6b1d83a0910150725u7849030qc9178f8b101d8e92@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

In my organization, we are currently using OWASP testing guide for carrying
web application security testing and are now planning to adopt to OWASP ASVS
standard as well now.

My understanding of these two documents is that the OWASP ASVS standard is a
requirements document which sets verification requirements at differnt
levels, while OWASP testing guide acts as a testing framework and describes
which tests need to be conducted and how.

Some of the verification requirements are very broadly specified in the ASVS
document and thus it is not very clear what needs to be done or tested to
pass a particular requirement, e.g. "V2.8 Verify that all account management
functions are at least as resistant to attack as the primary authentication
mechanism." Now it does not tell what account management functions need to
be tested here and thus everyone is open for their own interpretation of
this requirement.

My question here is if the ASVS team or the Testing Guide team have any
plans to create a mapping between the two. One of the benefits of doing this
would be that it will clearly define what needs to be tested to meet the
requirements of the standard document.

We have already thought of doing this in our organisation and I would not
mind sharing this if people here think that it can be a useful exercise.

Regards
Vishal

Hi Vishal,
yes you are right about the 2 guides, that's a really interesting and
propositional question.
I talked about it with Mike some time ago and I think we have to join
the same vision regarding the testing phase for the 2 projects.
I think we should go in this direction for the next release of the
guides, Mike what do you think?

Thanks,
Mat

Hi Mat,

It would probably be a good idea to map the testing guides categories
to the ASVS guide and vice versa by just adding the ASVS control that
it corresponds to in each of the testing points "reference" sections.
It might make more sense to have a separate Appendix in the testing
guide to cross reference the contols to this guide and potentially
other well known ones such as NIST800-53, PCI, etc.  Although this
could also be addressed as a seperate OWASP project such as in the
format of a matrix to cross reference the detailed testing controls of
the OWASP testing guide to a few of the most widely used guides (NIST,
PCI, ASVS, etc)?

Kevin

Hi Kevin,
yep you are right, we can work on adding the ASVS controls to the testing guide.
We also can add a matrix in the Appendix to cross reference the
testing guide with other standards.

Matt,

It looks like everyone has liked the idea. I have already started working on
this for my company, therefore I can do this for the wiki as well. If you
could please let me know how would you like this for the Wiki. I believe
creating an appendix would be a great idea.

At the moment, I am working on the level 2A of the standard, but I can
extend it to other levels as well for the wiki.

Hi Matt. First, thank you for your feedback, and I will update the project
page shortly! Second, you're on the right trail, the ASVS mail list is the
right place to spark discussions. I have admittedly been having more
one-on-one discussions with people rather than using the list, which I need
to get out of the habit of doing. Please also feel free to email me directly
if there is a question that you think hasn't been answered, or answered
completely, and I will work to track it down.

Mike
