hi,

i think web application and mobile application share some tests in a
similar/hybrid context, but the question is if this guide has into the
scope also mobile testing... then decide to include or not.

cheers,

Regarding our last brainstorming from OWASP Summit 2011, see:

https://www.owasp.org/images/b/b2/OWASP_Testing_Guide_-_OWASP_Summit_2011.pdf

especially from page 16 to 20.

It is a definitely good idea to 'reboot' this project again! :-)

I would call it more generally - "UI redressing attacks", in addition to basic
clickjacking there is also "strokejacking' (introduced by Michal Zalewski),
"likejacking" (introduced by Sophos), "eventjacking"/"classjacking"..

What are good CAPTCHAs at these days? :-) Using some commercial services (e.g.
http://www.deathbycaptcha.com it is possible to crack almost all CAPTCHAs of
all big services...)...

Hi all,

It's great to see the list active again! :)

Section 4.11 AJAX TESTING describes Ajax specific vulnerabilities and how
to test them explaining the original XMLHttpRequest object. The point is
current browsers supports the new API XMLHttpRequest Level 2 allowing users
to issue cross domain requests (CORS) and that is not covered, so this
needs to be updated.

In a general sense, any of the vulnerabilities that affect HTML5 specific
features are not covered and we should add new sections to describe them
for example:

- Web messaging testing
- XMLHttpRequest Level 2 (CORS) testing
- WebSockets
- Local storage/Client-side databases
- Offline applications
...

I can help with these sections and explain how to test for vulnerabilities
in this new HTML5/JavaScript APIs. That would complement the HTML5 Security
Cheat Sheet that covers how to implement the standard in a secure way.

hey al

the original aim of the guide was to be as agnostic as possible with
regards to tools, leaving the tool choice up to the person doing the
test. Where possible, however, we should use readily available tools
that aren't of commercial nature. I love what the ZAP team are doing,
it's a great tool and readily available/updated, so in this case it
would work out well.

hi juan,

i don't know if can be a nice idea to add a specific section for html5
testing (some issues are known vulnerabilities but in new ways and
others new)... and if is into the scope of the tg also mobile testing
can be handled in a similar way. i think web, html5 and mobile testing
have some differences but also similarities.

My 0.02? if we want to produce a cutting edge guide that it will sound
appealing also to devs (and a lot of devs I know they want to being
introduced in testing, at least in the basics), supporting HTML5 and
all the news it introduced it *is a must*.

Matteo, as usual count on me for reviewing.

Hi,

The contents of the TG are organized based on types of vulnerabilities
and is not feature oriented, so we have to think the best way to add
this new content regarding HTML5 (and mobile).
As I can see in the new table of contents[1], the section for Ajax
Testing is not there anymore, but there is a new "Client Side Testing
(New!)". Is this the best place?
Other approach would be to review different sections and update them
with the bits that have changed. For example in the case of CORS, if
the URLs passed to XMLHttpRequest.open are not validated that can lead
to code injection, so there is the option to review each appropriate
section (for example in this case XSS) and add the specific content
for the new features.

Another thing... since we talk about XML parsing while testing
webservices, we should also check if something can be exploited in the
wild when data is exchanged using JSON.

Another 0.02 cents.

Agreed. Anyone knows why is then called *XML*HttpRequest? :)

JSON is now all over the web. We need to cover JSONP and other insecure
practices.

XMLHttpRequest is the fundamental object used behind the scene in an
Ajax call (http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_http.asp).

I guess it's there because in earlier guide version there were less
frameworks for ajax calls.

Actually XML vs JSON debate is a question either client side (ajax
calls) than server side (APIs and webservices using both the data
formats) that we must address in the guide.

I have taken the liberty of assigning myself against several of the
Authentication Testing test cases.  I am happy to hand those over if someone
is interested in be assigned to those instead.

What happened to the Denial of Service test cases?

Is there a template to adhere to when the writing stage begins?

Introduction and Project purpose for v4:
============================ ============= The OWASP Testing Guide v3
includes a "best practice" penetration testing framework which users can
implement in their own organizations and a "low level" penetration testing
guide that describes techniques for testing most common web application and
web service security issues. Nowadays the Testing Guide has become the
standard to perform a Web Application Penetration Testing and many Companies
all around the world have adopted it.
It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that represents
the state of the art for WebAppSec.

Project Roadmap
=============

- (1) 1st phase: Brainstorming and create a new table of contents

Objective: creating a new table of contents of the OTGv4 assigning a task
for each contributor.
I created a new OWASP Testing Guide v4 table of Contents here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

- (2) 2nd phase:  Writing
20th September 2012: Start writing the articles 1st November 2012: 1st Draft
30th November: end of writing phase

- (3) 3rd phase: Reviewing

- 1st December 2012: Starting the review phase,
- 15th December 2012: Create the RC1,
- 31st January 2013: Release the version 4.

Timeline November 2012 1st Draft, January 2013 Final Release

So, let's start discussion about phase (1)!

Thanks!
Mat

Hello,

What about a section for cryptographic attacks? Bad use of crypto functions
in general. (Hash Length Extension, etc.) or would that be outside the
scope of the guide?

+1!

I think that is really important to cover.

I've seen a new  "Testing for Data Encryption (New!)" under the data
validation section, but I would rather consider to have a main section for
"Cryptography" at the same level of authentication, authorization, data
validation and so on.

Cryptography is one of the most important topics in security and there have
been quite significant crypto vulnerabilities applied to webapps like the
padding oracle attack technique that was applied to decrypt HTTP cookies in
several frameworks like ASP.NET, ROR and JSF two years back. Or the one
Eduardo mention, extension attacks due to improper or lack of use of HMAC
algorithms, that is quite common.

Actually, there are already few sections under DV in the new table of
contents, that would fit in that section:

Testing for Data Encryption
(New!)<https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing_for_Data_Encryption_(New!)&action=edit&redlink=1>

Application did not use encryption
Weak SSL/TSL Ciphers

Insufficient Transport Layer Protection

Insecure Cryptographic Storage [mainly CR Guide]


Thoughts?

hi all,

i see the question is "data encryption" covers transmission and storage both.

historically two issues are divided. to brainstorming some stuff, also
using the web application security testing checklist [1]:

 - not used when necessary (e.g. for credential transportation or storage)
 - algorithms
   - weak/homebrew (e.g. on ssl or when developers uses weak
algorithms to protect data)
   - wrong context (e.g. symmetric encryption for password storage)
   - improper usage (e.g. hashing without salting, kdf with less iterations)
 - keys and secrets
   - weak/short/guessable (e.g. also on ssl)
 - entropy issues
   - weak random generators
   - ...

ideas?

s.

Hello.

As I mentioned some days ago, I suggested improve SSL Test maybe based no
Qualys SSLabs issues and other.

"SSL Test
 -> Enhace (maybe based on Qualys SSLlabs  tests?)"

Still talking about "cryptography not used when necessary" I would say that
is important to cover aspects of technologies which use ViewState concept
(e.g. JSF, .NET).

Hello.

I think maybe we should make a cross-reference between the ToC and the
Testing Cheat Sheet. It would help us to identify which aspects are covered
and which aren?t covered in the ToC.
For example: SSO is covered in the cheatsheet and not covered in the ToC.
Also HTTP DoS.
It also can give us some ideas about the names of the sections. If anybody
did it already I can do it.

Hello All!

I've compiled the Web App Penetration Test part from the ToC with all
(sorry if I missed some!) suggestions presented in the list.

Follow the results.

We also have to decide whether mobile will be part of the scope or not.



-----------------------------------------

For sake of self promoting myself :-)
I blogged about SSL testing:

http://thesp0nge.com/blog/2012/02/01/announce-ciphersurfer-v1-dot-0-0/
http://armoredcode.com/blog/some-security-tips-for-ruby-hackers-leveraging-the-attack-surface-part-2/

And released a Ruby gem making the ssl tests using Qualys ranking system:

End of self promoting :)

Hi,
thanks Ismael.
I'll update the ToC on the wiki (there are some items repeated 2 times
and some to understand better if include).

As Kevin said mobile testing is part of another OWASP project.

Regarding many contributors contacting me directly or asking to
contribute, first of all thanks, then please specify which
area/paragraph would you like to cover.

Paragraph template: yes we have a template from v3, may we can review
also that. From the 2nd phase (writing the new guide) I'll create a new
paragraph with this template for each item to write.

Tools: as Daniel said yes we have to be agnostic regarding the tools.
But at the end of each paragraph as usual we can specify a list of Open
Source tools that help to perform that test.

Remember that we are creating a guide for Web Application Penetration
Testing. All the test will be called "Testing for [test]".

So cryptographic tests are good to add but only that regarding the
running application testing, for example Padding Oracle.
But "weak random generators" and "weak algorithms to protect data" in
general is not possible to test when performing a WebAppPentest.

WebAppSecTesting Cheat Sheet:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Security_Testing_Cheat_Sheet

In the testing Guide we have already a similar paragraph (v3):
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist

I think we can use it to verify if some items are missing, than the
cheat sheet will be updated to the new Testing Checklist paragraph (as
mentioned in the Cheat sheet purpose).

Thanks!
Mat

hi matt,

in general is not possible, but as you know it's possible - for
example exploiting a sql injection - to find clear-text passwords.

in this case i think is nice to insert in report(s) a link to the
testing guide (as the testing guide the standard for security testing)
:)

other owasp document can be integrated/considered is the owasp asvs
(for specfic verifications required by the level), if is needed i've
some mappings.

ciao,

s.

Hello,

I like what Ismael did; It certainly takes into account most of the
comments so far.

My comments:
- I believe that "Incubated vulnerability" is redundant since it is
basically about exploiting XSS, SQLi, or unrestricted file uploads.
- I propose that 4.9 "Testing for Data Encryption" should be renamed to
something like "Testing for insecure cryptography use/impementation", so it
may encompass other vulnerabilities like Hash extension, Viewstate
encryption/signing,  Padding Oracle, etc.

Regards,

Eduardo Castellanos N.

Sure! Feel free to add my name on the list.
Actually, me and Stefano have already something drafted on HPP that has
been written during our research.

Speaking of "pure" XML, we should probably extend the XML injection
section with all techniques and details discovered by @Agarri_FR:
advanced XEE attacks (e.g. binary files retrieval), XSLT code exec, etc.

Cheers,

Hello.

I know we've been focused on testing list but I have some comments for
other sections.

a) About the Web Application Penetration Testing

Talking about the Web Application Penetration Testing (chapter 4), I
suggest we improve the section with some explanations.

4. Web Application Penetration testing

4.1 Introduction and Objectives
 -> Introduce about typical penetration test phases
  Here we would have an overview of a typical pen-test, divided into 4
phases.
  1) Plan
   This part basically talks about how to plan a penetration test
   -> Types of the Test (maybe the explanation about types of test could be
fit in a section in the beginning of the testing guide)
    -> Black Box
    -> White Box
    -> Gray Box
   -> Viewpoint
    -> External
    -> Internal
   -> Scope
    -> http://www.targetedapp.com
   -> Restrictions
    -> List of all restrictions (e.g. do not perform DoS, social
engineering)
  2) Discovery
   -> Information Gathering
   -> Vulnerability Analysis
  3) Attack
   -> Attack itself
  4) Report
   -> Last Phase of a penetration test (chapter 5 writing report)



b) About the paragraph of the testing cases:

One of the goals of this version is to make the Testing Guide more
readable. I think we need to define commons subsections present in all
testing cases.
Then, all testing cases would have the same sections and formats. I already
suggest to have the checklist (questions) in a pre-defined subsection
inside each
testing case. If we have a checklist in a table format, we could get them
and put them into a big table that could be printed and checked.

For example:

4.5.4 Testing for Exposed Session Variables (OWASP-SM-004)
 4.5.4.2   Brief Summary
 4.5.4.3   Description of the issue
 4.5.4.4   Related security activities
 4.5.4.5   Threats
 4.5.4.6   Countermesures
 4.5.4.7   Testing
    -> Black Box
            -> Technique 1
            -> Results expected
    -> Gray Box
             ....
    -> White Box
             ....
 4.5.4.8   Checklist
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | OWASP-SM-004                                      | Black Box | White
Box | Gray Box |
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | 1. Cache-control definied to no-cache      |           |
|          |                    |
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   | 2. Different session token after login        |           |
|          |                    |
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4.5.4.9    References
 4.5.4.10  Tools
We can also have a box called tips in each section with some tips
highlighted.
Regards.

Hi Matteo/all,

Good to see a lot of activity for the Testing Guide v4!

I went quickly through all comments made so far.

Here are some observations I have regarding the ToC structure and future
content:

- Web services testing: I have noticed there is a comprehensive methodology
which covers more aspects than the v3 does:
http://clawslab.nds.rub.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page - I wonder if such
methodology should be included and/or mentioned in v4?

- Anti-CSRF mechanism testing - should that fit into the new CSRF section
or as a separate item?

- Framework application testing: dedicated section about attacks against
specific technology used in frameworks: e.g. .NET/Spring or frameworks
which require a different testing approach:  e..g Adobe Flex or Google Web
ToolKit (GWT). Do you see those as separate mini-projects or potentially to
be included in the testing guide v4?

- Client-side testing: imho we should cover testing for: Java applets,
Silverlight and ActiveX controls as well.

- Browser addons/extension testing: in the past, there was some discussion
about browser addons/plugins, e.g. Firefox addons or Chrome extensions but
I am unsure whether they should fit into the testing guide or into a
separate project, as it has been done for the mobile application testing.

My 2 cents,

Roberto Suggi Liverani (@malerisch)

Hello all!
This mail just to inform that me and 3 colleagues would like to contribute with the v4.
Looking the TOC whe'd partecipate with a review / update / new material to the next chapters:
3. The OWASP Testing Framework (with all sub-chapters)
4.2 Information Gathering
4.7 Business Logic Testing

In the next days (after a internal brain storming) we will post here our ideas.
Thanks

Ale

Hello Jim.

I'm thinking about a good way to add it because the risk I've put in the
table is also calculated based on business impact, then a XSS flaw once
exploited for example has a different impact according to the business.

Regards.

you folks mean probably technical impact?

"The business impact stems from the technical impact, but requires a
deep understanding of what is important to the company running the
application. " according to OWASP risk rating methology.

For one company availabity or reputation can have a huge impact
and they care less about SQL injection because (e.g. no information
of users are affected) whereas for others the opposite is true.

If you don't understand the buiness model of a particular institution,
you cannot estimate their business risks, only technical ones.

Best, Dirk

Hello all.

That's exactly what I've tried to point out.
The risk I presented on that table is based on business impact and not only
on technical impact. Then it's not easy to add it to Cheat Sheet. It's an
example from a report I've presented.
Even the likelihood is different according to the application assessed and
it makes the risk different from customer to customer.
Our thoughts are alligned.

Jim.

Maybe we can add a Cheat Sheet talking about how to classify risks based on
OWASP Risk Rating Methodology. We can also discuss this cheat sheet in
other forum.

Best Regards.

Ismael Gon?alves

I've moved "Directory traversal/file include" from Authentication to
Authorization as this sections is more appropriate.

And I've added HTML5 as a subsection of Client Side Testing to cover
specific vulnerabilities of HTML5 like XMLHttpRequest Level 2
cross-domain security issues.

I wrote my name under some sections too.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] V4 Update ideas
Message-ID: <505C3D78.1000109@mediaservice.net>

Hello everybody.
as we have promised here there are some consideration about some updates.

********** Chapter 3 (The OWASP Testing Framework)
Update and add contents whit primary focus on the SAMM framework and
test/task in the various phases of SDLC.
Add a references part.

********** Chapter 4.2 (Information Gathering)
Update and add contents in the next subchapter:

4.2.1 Spiders, Robots and Crawlers (OWASP-IG-001)
    Add material about Spiders and Crawlers (not only robots.txt)
    Add robots techniques for "not html" files (swf / silverlightl /
jsfx / java class / ...)

4.2.2 Search Engine Discovery/Reconnaissance (OWASP-IG-002)
     Add Search Engine on social (linkedin / facebook / twitter / ...)
     Obtain information from the web by helpdesk, config files, help
files, ...
     How to use googling for our test (search particular variables name,
db name, path, ...)
     Search inside the Metadata (Foca tool?)
     Search information inside default files like "thunmbs.db",
".dstrore" ...?
    
4.2.4 Testing Web Application Fingerprint (OWASP-IG-004) --> update +
parte identificazione framework client / applicativi + cms
    Identify default application, client framework, development
framework, ...
    Identify optional components on CMS
    Use http://www.shodanhq.com/ ?
   
4.2.5 Application Discovery (OWASP-IG-005)
    HTTPS hostname to find virtual host
    dns brute forcing
    default directory, banner, ...
   
4.2.x Add a chapter about infoleaks from vulnerability (db info from
sqlinj, server info from ldapinj, ...) ?
   
4.2.x Add a chapter about how to obtain info from the application code
(variables names, directory structure, parameters, application step, ...) ?
   
********** Chapter 4.7 (Business Logic Testing)

This chapter has to be enlarged, we need more example to help the tester
to identify logic testing problems. Some new examples can be related to:
- cheats examples
- service abuse: sms flood / recharge, mail bombing etc
- use 3rd part attack vector to interact with the web app, for example:
XSS/SQL Injection via SMS, call center, twitter, etc
- understand that application can work with other components in the
infrastructure, maybe a XSS can't be used directly on the tested
application but can be used to others customer application that
visualize the data

********** Other chapters that are missing:

- Identification and bypass of WAF: an introduction about WAF, how to
identify the presence of them and a short description of fundamental
bypass technique.
- "Akamai" service and identification of real web server (www-org
secure-org)
- JSON Testing: short description of JSON and testing.
- AMF Testing: short description of AMF and testing.
- ViewState Testing: description of Viewstate, how it work and what a
tester need to check for the correct implementation.
- Maybe a section about the MS padding oracle problem?

An idea is also to introduce the idea of the "vertical privilege
escalation" and "horizontal privilege escalation"
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation) in all the testing
guide. Maybe the idea can be explained with some graph too.


We'll wait for ur feedback.
Thks

Alessandro

OpenSAMM is outside of the scope of the Testing Guide but the
touchpoint is discussed within the thread starting at
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/samm/2011-September/000314.html

last looked at Bing/Yahoo! earlier in 2012) then please let me/us

I believe Social Network, Social Engineering and Document Metadata is
outside of the Testing Guide and is explored by say PTES already.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Search_engine_discovery/reconnaissance_(OWASP-IG-002)
was intended to deflate the hype of
http://www.hackersforcharity.org/ghdb/.

Also, a majority of http://www.hackersforcharity.org/ghdb/ or
http://www.exploit-db.com/google-dorks/ aren't vuln, rather they are
people copy and pasting the various Google Search Queries :)

I would support the inclusion of http://builtwith.com/ but not SHODAN.

The use case for SHODAN in this context is

Are you referring to the "Target Analyzer" of Burp Pro (for instance)?

Alessandro,

Below are a list of resources that I presented last Tuesday (18
September) at http://www.meetup.com/SAGE-AU-NSW/events/77817862/
regarding the "network recon of www servers" (the last two, DShield
and Shodan, would not be applicable to the Testing Guide but has been
included for completeness):

HTTPS/SSLv3/TLS:
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=[INSERT DOMAIN-NAME]

Web Technologies
http://builtwith.com/[INSERT DOMAIN-NAME]

SEO
http://optimizer.builtwith.com/seo/[INSERT DOMAIN-NAME]

vhost:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff795671.aspx
http://www.domaintools.com/research/reverse-ip/

Incident/Attack Database:
http://dshield.org/api/ip/[INSERT IP ADDRESS]?text

Host Port and Banner Database:
http://www.shodanhq.com/

Furthermore, I will possibly be delivering another related
presentation sometime after/during November on the more host and
network layer on things like
http://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/, etc which
I didn't cover during this presentation so I can push out the second
list if you would like for discussion as to the scope of the OWASP
Testing Guide v4?

On Testing Guide 3 there wasn't any chapter about real
spidering/crawling, the results of this activity are used into the
OWASP-IG-003, but if this task is done on the wrong way a tester could
miss a lot of entry points.

On our experience metadata, googling and others can give very valuables
informations about the web applications. You don't have to look at
metadata and google only on the standard and known way.

We have found a lot of time a configuration about the apache of our
customer (for example in help forum). The metadata of docs can be used
to create a wordlist for bruteforce. The social network (linkedin and
facebook) can be used too for wordlist creation, for example by
searching the sysadmins name/nickname.

I think that this guide have to become something more than an "how to
find sql injection".

Shodan host profile can be useful for identify system technology. But I
have to get more information of the usage ;)

A very good tool was "hostmap" (http://hostmap.lonerunners.net/), but
now is dead. I will check all the ways used by the software to find
virtual host.

We ask to disable the WAF too during test, but I think a chapter will be
very useful for non so experienced tester.

Has anyone put any thought into test cases for HTML5 localstorage [1,2] or web sockets [3,4,5]? I also recall reading some articles last year that suggested there were weaknesses in the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) implementation (draft spec).

I sadly haven't had lots of time to look into these but I can foresee various security issues related to such technology.

I've moved "Directory traversal/file include" from Authentication to Authorization as this sections is more appropriate.

And I've added HTML5 as a subsection of Client Side Testing to cover specific vulnerabilities of HTML5 like XMLHttpRequest Level 2 cross-domain security issues.

I wrote my name under some sections too.

Hello All!

We had a lot of suggestions for the ToC and I?m wondering if the ToC is
already defined and when we are going to start writing.

Hi all, 
Yes we have also too many items and some items repeated 2 times. I'm reviewing it and updating it. Next days we can start writing. 
Thank you all,

This was one of the recommendation(s) of
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2011-August/001930.html

The only caveat would be that spidering et al wouldn't be applicable
for a development web server since the results will be incorrect (to
that of the production web server).

The issue that I was intending to address was (as an example)
http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/telstra-customer-database-exposed-20111209-1on60.html

The above is already covered in other documents (outside of OWASP) and
we would ultimately just be duplicating their information without
providing any additional value.

Since @mediaservice contribute to the OSSTMM i.e.
http://www.isecom.org/team.html then maybe you could include the
relevant links to/from the OWASP Testing Guide v4?

The issue with this is it may alinate the already established audience.

SHODAN will provide with the historical web server header(s) over time.

I like the bodies of work produced by Ivan Ristic e.g.

Yes, maybe SAMM is out of scope. I dont want subistitue the testing
framework whit SAMM but I think that could be useful have in this part a
focus (executive summary's depth) on a "larger" Secure SDLC framework
(SAMM / BSIMM / ...) (SAMM is the most related with owasp, right?).
And sure we have to insert something about the touchpoint (starting from

Burp Target Analyzer generate a good report about dynamic / static
pages. This is useful.
I mean also pay attention on tipical application strutcture useful for
brute force, some example:
- variables / parameters / directory structure format : "word1_word2"
"Word1Word2
- step pages: "page_1.asp" "page02.aspx"
- language: "amministrazione" / "admin"

Hi Christian,

Before starting write to the ML for the new ideas/contributions we
discuss (some colleagues) how OWASP Testing Guide can be a better guide,
we tried to ask ourself what are the point that a newbie "web app
pentester" need to learn to do the job.

It's true a lot of our proposal can be found on others documents, we are
not creating nothing new, but all OWASP TG chapter/info can be found in
others places. As wrote on the project overview, the goal of the project
it's create a "best practices web application penetration testing
framework", so why exclude some things useful for the testers?

A skilled pentester (maybe one that do also others kind of PT) doesn't
need all these info for do the job, he don't need a chapter about
finding the web server technology or a chapter about how to identify if
a WAF is on the target. So what's the correct audience of OWASP TG? For
who is OWASP TG?

Add just some links to the testing guide it's a way, but I'm not sure
that is the best way for OWASP to grow.

I hope that also others people will reply to this topic to know also
others thought.

Regars,

Maurizio

Great Point!
?
I think taht this means that we need to specifically at the beginning of the document "Who the intended audience is"?
?
I think the guide should be the "one stop shop" for the?"newbie"
?
Not rewriting the other documents but tieing them together in one place so an experience person can use it as a quick reference and the newbie can use it to?leran.??
?
Thanks,
David :)

Hi Christian,

Before starting write to the ML for the new ideas/contributions we
discuss (some colleagues) how OWASP Testing Guide can be a better guide,
we tried to ask ourself what are the point that a newbie "web app
pentester" need to learn to do the job.

It's true a lot of our proposal can be found on others documents, we are
not creating nothing new, but all OWASP TG chapter/info can be found in
others places. As wrote on the project overview, the goal of the project
it's create a "best practices web application penetration testing
framework", so why exclude some things useful for the testers?

A skilled pentester (maybe one that do also others kind of PT) doesn't
need all these info for do the job, he don't need a chapter about
finding the web server technology or a chapter about how to identify if
a WAF is on the target. So what's the correct audience of OWASP TG? For
who is OWASP TG?

Add just some links to the testing guide it's a way, but I'm not sure
that is the best way for OWASP to grow.

I hope that also others people will reply to this topic to know also
others thought.

Regars,

Maurizio

Hello All.

About the suggestion of WAF, I've suggested in a previous email a topic
that talks about Evasion techniques in general and WAF could fit in it. The
idea of this topic is to talk about filter evasion in general.

Talking about the audience, I agree with Maurizio considerations about the
theme and we should try to answer the question about a person who is
learning his job. If you take for example "The Web Application Hackers
Handbook", it presents even the HTTP protocol there (just to illustrate).

Regards.

+1, but with a slight reservation.

 

The problem with having an introduction that presents the HTTP protocol in detail is that the next thing you find yourself doing is explaining TCP.. We need to set a certain boundary to how deep and detailed we get.

However, what I think we do need to do is make sure that we provide an introduction and relevant chapters that allow the user to go and perform additional reading when needed.

 

This means in the introduction there should be a paragraph along the following lines - this guide assumes the reader has basic knowledge of HTTP, the concept of an intercepting proxy, etc. (we could even drop a couple of lines on each, but not go into a full-blown explanation of what each of these means).

Then say that a reader who is not familiar with these basic and important topics can read more on the subject here, here and here (and here). 

 

I think this extends to various other issues we've discussed previously. For example - on the topic of mobile testing - I don't think we should avoid mentioning it altogether, but rather have a short paragraph that says here is what is similar here is what is different (in very high level), then refer the user to mobile testing guide. Same goes for testing of applications using non-http protocols, for example, and various other topics that I think should be mentioned if we are trying to create a single document from where the user can branch and read more if needed.

 

My 2c.

I think WAF evasion (or other evasion such as reverse proxy, IPS,
etc.) should be included as an Appendix, if at all, or just add a
reference to other projects where applicable.  If we start to include
other topics then the guide starts to trail off and we end up with a
1000+ page guide that is almost to cumbersome to use.  WAF evasion or
even just overall evasion techniques could potentially be an OWASP
project in itself.  Just my 2 cents.

I have split this thread off due to its relevance to OpenSAMM and BSIMM.

OpenSAMM and BSIMM are both related to http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/
and I have CCed the OpenSAMM OWASP Mailing List and BCC Gary McGraw,
Brian Chess and Sammy Migues (the authors of BSIMM) for their
respective comment.

I would prefer to make not make a recommendation for either BSIMM and
OpenSAMM as I would consider that to be a conflict of interest but
have published an objective view of their slight differences within
http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/bsammbo which has been reviewed by both
BSIMM and OpenSAMM.

Both OpenSAMM and BSIMM have not direct relationship to the SDL, aside
from attempting to measure its maturity and
http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/learn/assess.aspx might be more
relevant to your proposal.

However, I believe that OpenSAMM, BSIMM and/or the SDL Development
Model would made as a recommendation within the report based on the
OWASP Testing Guide.

The difference with the OWASP Testing Guide v3 then is that you would
have to execute multiple searches if the robots.txt and/or metadata
prohibits caching of the content since you cannot retrieve the cached
web page and execute the various regex.

There is also some WAF product (the name escapes me at the moment)
which will mimic the various GHDB and will then trigger an alarm when
the generated page is accessed.

I agree here are some process items I have from v3:
?
Section 1 ? Testing Techniques Explained
? Page 19
??????????? Although Black, Grey, white Box
testing is addressed in the document and are
??????????? common terms should they be defined?
????????????????????? 
??????????? Should the concept of Automated
Static and dynamic testing be addressed?
Section 1 ? Testing Techniques Explained
- Page 20 Threat Modeling
??????????? 
Should
this link to the OWASP Threat Risk Modeling page?
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling
?
Section 1 ?
Testing Techniques Explained ? Page 26 ? Security Requirements Validation
Could it be mentioned that the list
of controls in Section 4 Could be used as ?Global? requirements in addition to
the ?specific? requirements specified in the application requirements. All may
not be applicable for all applications. 
?
Section 1 ? Testing Techniques Explained
? Page 36
?
??????????? Would this be a good place to
discuss the OWASP Risk Rating
??????????? https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology
??????????? Which is included in page 325 in
detail
?
Section 3 ? The OWASP Testing Framework
? Page 40
?
??????????? Should Open SAMM be mentioned here
??????????? https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model
?
Section 3 ? The OWASP Testing Framework
? Phase 2: During Definition and Design - Page 41
?
??????????? Should ESAPI be mentioned here as a
best practice?
??????????? https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API
?
??????????? Should the references to coding
standards be given, for example:
CERT - https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/CERT+Secure+Coding+Standards;jsessionid=A9B9B2080B83DEEB21CE15B1415CEDD9
?
??????????? https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/CERT+C+Secure+Coding+Standard
?
??????????? https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/Top+10+Secure+Coding+Practices
Section 3 ? The OWASP Testing Framework
? The Phases especially 4 and 5 page 43
?
??????????? I would like to see some more
details, guidance and checklists or what exactly to do and
check
?
Section 3 ? The OWASP Testing Framework
? OWASP Testing Framework Work Flow ? Page 45
?
All work tasks do not seem to be
included in this section, for example the section details do not include ?Unit
and System Tests? and ?Acceptance Tests? in the Deployment part of this section
on page 43 or 44. 
?
Section 4 - Web Application Penetration
Testing ? Chart - page 47
?
??????????? Would it be possible to add another column? linking to the specific OWASP top 10. My
reasoning is that someone may say they will test to the OWASP top 10. So they
need a good list.
?
Section 4 - Web Application Penetration
Testing 
?
??????????? It seems like the test types have Grey box, White
box and Black Box but it is not consistent. I think all should probably include
all 3 types and if it is not applicable state it.
?
Appendix A: Testing Tools
?
??????????? Should WebInspect be added to the
Commercial Black Box Testing Tools?
??????????? 
Should
there be an acceptance Testing Tools ? Commercial section for tools such as:
??????????? HP Quick Test Professional
??????????????????????? IBM Rational Robot
??????????????????????? Etc.
?
??????????? Should the BuildSecurityin web site
be added to the ?Useful Websites? section?
??????????????????????? https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/home.html
??????????? 
??????????? Should Web Service testing tool
soapUI be added?
??????????????????????? http://www.soapui.org/Security/getting-started.html
??????????? 
Thanks,
David :)?

Hello.
I know we've been focused on testing list but I have some comments for other sections.
a) About the Web Application Penetration Testing
Talking about the Web Application Penetration Testing (chapter 4), I suggest we improve the section with some explanations. 
4. Web Application Penetration testing
4.1 Introduction and Objectives
?-> Introduce about typical penetration test phases 
??Here we would have an overview of a typical pen-test, divided into 4 phases.
??1) Plan
???This part basically talks about how to plan a penetration test
???-> Types of the Test (maybe the explanation about types of test could be fit in a section in the beginning of the testing guide)
????-> Black Box
????-> White Box
????-> Gray Box
???-> Viewpoint
????-> External
????-> Internal
???-> Scope
????-> http://www.targetedapp.com
???-> Restrictions
????-> List of all restrictions (e.g. do not perform DoS, social engineering)
??2) Discovery
???-> Information Gathering
???-> Vulnerability Analysis
??3) Attack
???-> Attack itself
??4) Report
???-> Last Phase of a penetration test (chapter 5 writing report)
?

b) About the paragraph of the testing cases:
One of the goals of this version is to make the Testing Guide more readable. I think we need to define commons subsections present in all testing cases.
Then, all testing cases would have the same sections and formats. I already suggest to have the checklist (questions) in a pre-defined subsection inside each 
testing case. If we have a checklist in a table format, we could get them and put them into a big table that could be printed and checked. 
For example:
4.5.4 Testing for Exposed Session Variables (OWASP-SM-004)
?4.5.4.2?? Brief Summary
?4.5.4.3?? Description of the issue
?4.5.4.4?? Related security activities
?4.5.4.5?? Threats
?4.5.4.6?? Countermesures
?4.5.4.7?? Testing
??? -> Black Box 
???????? ???-> Technique 1
????????????-> Results expected
??? -> Gray Box
???????????? ....
??? -> White Box
???????????? ....
?4.5.4.8?? Checklist
???-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
???| OWASP-SM-004????????????????????????????????????? | Black Box | White Box | Gray Box |
???-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
???| 1. Cache-control definied to no-cache????? |?????????? |?????????? |????????? |????????????????????|
???-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
???| 2. Different session token after login?????? ?|?????????? |?????????? |????????? |??????????????????? |
???-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?4.5.4.9?? ?References
?4.5.4.10? Tools
We can also have a box called tips in each section with some tips highlighted.

Regards.

Have we considered internal (authenticated) vs external (public) XSS.
they are quite different risks also depending on the role in which the
vulnerable function is visible. say Admin function that is XSS is worse
than an lesser role.
