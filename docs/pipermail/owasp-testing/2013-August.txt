Matteo and Andrew,

I noticed that both "Review Webserver Metafiles for Information
Leakage" and "Conduct search engine discovery/reconnaissance for
information leakage" have drifted towards
http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/ghdb/ after v3 was published (in hardcopy
before February 2009).

Furthermore, this content within the OWASP Testing Guide v3 was a
subset of the scope of a much larger process that I last presented in
2009 i.e. unpack
http://www.syscan.org/index.php/download/get/38d3739861e3e9ef8ee4d07d22c9a8be/SyScan09_Singapore_Slides.zip
 and the slides are "cmlh - googless - SyScan'09SG - Last Updated 25
June 2009.pdf"

Roberto also wanted to contribute some of his research too i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2011-August/001932.html

Would it be possible to be assigned as a reviewer to both these
sections for v3 before they "go to press" (so to speak)?

Hi Christian, 
thanks for your offer to review these two test cases. Offer gratefully accepted! I'll add you as reviewer of those articles now. But please don't restrict yourself to these two if you have the bandwidth. 

Andrew.

Hi again fellow OWASP testers,
  We've had a steady flow of offers for help getting version 4 of the
Testing Guide written and reviewed. So we're starting the August sprint *NOW
*! If you've already been assigned articles, use August to author, review
and update your articles in the wiki (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents).
If you've been assigned an article with another author, then *please
collaborate with them*. Names are emails are included in the Paragraph
Management spreadsheet for this very purpose.
(
https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmEhPtZ0cHq3dDc5ZFI0Nm9oSkhzNkNxTzNJbGdPdVE#gid=0
)

During August we'll continually review where we're at, and if you're
struggling to commit the time to complete your tasks or you're fighting
ideological battles with your co-authors, then please let us know early.
Please try to give us some idea of your progress throughout the month.

We've still got a few articles that need to be adopted by an author, but we
can't wait around and will pick them up either mid-sprint or next sprint.
Let us (Sam, Matt or myself) know if you're interested in taking on any of
these articles:
4.8.6.1 Oracle Testing
4.8.6.3 SQL Server Testing
4.8.6.4 Testing PostgreSQL (from OWASP BSP)
4.8.6.5 MS Access Testing
4.8.15 Testing for Buffer overflow (OTG-INPVAL-015) formerly "Testing for
Buffer overflow (OWASP-DV-014)"
4.8.15.1 Testing for Heap overflow
4.8.15.2 Testing for Stack overflow
4.8.15.3 Testing for Format string
4.8.16 Testing for incubated vulnerabilities (OTG-INPVAL-016) formerly
"Testing for incubated vulnerabilities (OWASP-DV-015)"
4.8.17 Testing for HTTP Splitting/Smuggling (OTG-INPVAL-017) formerly
"Testing for HTTP Splitting/Smuggling (OWASP-DV-016)"
4.9.1 Analysis of Error Codes (OTG-ERR-001) formerly "Analysis of Error
Codes (OWASP-IG-006)"
4.10.3 Testing for Padding Oracle (OTG-CRYPST-003) formerly "Testing for
Padding Oracle (OWASP-EN-003)"
4.11.1 Test time synchronisation (OTG-LOG-001) formerly "Incorrect time"
4.11.2 Test user-viewable log of authentication events (OTG-LOG-002)
4.13.1 Test Regular expression DoS (OTG-DOS-001) [New!] note: to understand
better
4.15.3 Testing for Cross Site Flashing (OTG-CLIENT-003) formerly "Testing
for Cross Site Flashing (OWASP-CS-003)"

Some of these articles already have content that just needs to be reviewed
and updated, while others are completely new and need to be authored. Let
us know if you can take on any of these.

Have a great and productive August and we're looking forward to a
successful sprint at the end of the month.

all the best,
  Andrew

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Testing Guide : Tools sections
Message-ID: <CAORxfg4tSNg-P4Rd4xDnPpEuXW2nih-a=-Noggv-Xuq6EKRnMg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm planning on going through the guide adding ZAP to the relevant tools
sections, and will try and add other tools that I know are definitely
relevant .

Is there a preferred format?

There seem to be verious formats used for similar tools, eg:

   - Web Proxy (*Burp Suite*[6] <http://portswigger.net>,
*Paros*[7]<http://www.parosproxy.org/index.shtml>,
   *WebScarab*[8] <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project>)
   - OWASP WebScarab:
OWASP_WebScarab_Project<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project>
   - WebScarab Spider
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project

I was thinking of adding a small amount of info to indicate which
components of ZAP are relevant, but nothing that would exceed one line, eg:

   - OWASP ZAP: OWASP Zed Attack Proxy
Project<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project>-
Active scanner and fuzzer

That OK?
Should tools be listed in any sort of order, eg alphabetical? Or OWASP ones
first?
Should only free open source tools be included or are commercial tools
acceptable?

Cheers,

Simon

Hi Simon, 
I'm glad you raised this Simon. To date I've been thinking that the Guide needs to have solid instructional content for security testers. To achieve this I've modified the structure of test cases to include a "how to test" and a "tools" section. In demonstrating "how to test" I thought it appropriate to use examples from tools in the following priority order: 
1) OWASP tools (e.g. ZAP) because the OTG is an OWASP initiative, 
2) other free open-source tools because they align closely with OWASP principles, 
3) free closed-source tools because they kinda align with OWASP principles, 
4) commercial tools, if there is no other way to demonstrate the test. 
I don't believe we should not mention commercial tools at all. Vendors are not the devil. They are just folks offering tools in exchange for money. As long as we announce our interests in our decision making processes we should be okay. 

Whatever changes you make, please collaborate with the article author/reviewer/s listed in the Paragraph Management spreadsheet. 

On the topic of tools, it would be great to see demonstrations of testing tools against WebGoat, DVWA, etc so the Guide can better guide testers during training and testing. If you've already done something like this would you be interested in adding that to the Guide as well? 

regards, 
Andrew

That sounds good to me, especially the demos against WebGoat / DVWA etc.
Do you have a suggested format for these - eg is a list of instructions
with relevant screenshots ok?

Having said that I doubt I'll be able to find time to update all of the
sections with demos.
However I'll try to recruit some of the other ZAP developers and power
users to help out, stressing that they should collaborate with the article
authors/reviewers.

There is nothing planned yet.
I don't have much time working on it at the moment.
Every collaboration or help in developing this further is welcome.

Nevertheless, even without an update to v4 the test cases are still
useful.


Best,
Thomas

I commenced the review of "Review Webserver Metafiles for Information

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Talk:Testing:_Review_Webserver_Metafiles_for_Information_Leakage_(OTG-INFO-003)#TODO_for_v4

Is there a contact within OWASP who owns the Google Webmaster Tools
account?  If so can they provide the screenshots/screencast related to
https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156449?hl=en&from=35237&rd=1

Rick,

Well not specifically from OWASP but their example would be preferred.

I guess if anyone want to provide relevant screenshots from Google
Webmaster Tools of their domain(s) hosted on their web servers then
this is an acceptable alternative (depending on the content)?

Hi Christian, those comments were from me while v3 was still in draft. It seems they've been copied over from v3 as part of the v4 spin up.

I've replied further on the INFO-001 talk page. I'll get to INFO-003 shortly.

Message-ID: <F6174A7FB2F28248B34B7F3024FF2E60027668256D@MBX12.bell.corp.bce.ca>

I just had a client ask about: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology

It seems at some point in the last two years that the skill level ratings have been reversed. Such that a skilled attacker has a lower rating that an unskilled attacker. This doesn't make any logical sense. 

At a high level the wiki defines "Risk = Likelihood * Impact"

If Threat Agent goes towards the Likelihood part of the calculation a skilled individual should be of greater concern than an unskilled individual. If one's "most likely" attacker is skilled then their risk should be higher than if their "most likely" attacker is unskilled. So someone with "Security penetration skills" should be a 9 not a 1 (raising the risk calc)... On the flip side someone with "no technical skills" should be a 1 not a 9 (thus reducing my risk calc). 

>From the wiki page:
"The goal here is to estimate the likelihood of a successful attack by this group of threat agents. Use the worst-case threat agent.

Skill level
    How technically skilled is this group of threat agents? Security penetration skills (1), network and programming skills (3), advanced computer user (4), some technical skills (6), no technical skills (9)"

Further down the page: "Then you simply take the average of the scores to calculate the overall likelihood."

So using the numbers in the wiki table you come up with 4.375, if you increase the skill level value (thus decreasing the attacker's actual skill as defined earlier in the page) your risk rating is increased:
9|2|7|1|3|6|9|2 = AVG of 4.875 (where 9 is defined as unskilled) which would pull your whole risk rating for an issue up.
1|2|7|1|3|6|9|2 = AVG of 3.875 (where 1 is defined as highly skilled) which would drag your whole risk rating for an issue down.

Is the methodology trying to state that you're unlikely to be attacked by skilled individuals? Wouldn't that be a function of motivation or opportunity not skill? Meaning that while a highly skilled individual might pose greater risk from a skill perspective they may not be motivated or have opportunity to carry out and exploit of the issue in question.

"How technically skilled is this group of threat agents? Security
penetration skills (1), network and programming skills (3), advanced
computer user (4), some technical skills (6), no technical skills (9)"

This entire section should probably be redesigned to reflect the level of
resources an attacker has rather than technical skill.  Time and money are
great equalizers to skill because you can always train or develop the
skills needed (usually quite quickly for a specific vulnerability), or you
can outright hire someone to design an exploit for you.  A sufficiently
motivated attacker with sufficient resources probably poses a greater
threat than a group of the most l33t hackers who author exploits for money.

By the same token, under vulnerability factors, the following should
probably be replaced:
"How easy is it for this group of threat agents to actually exploit this
vulnerability? Theoretical (1), difficult (3), easy (5), automated tools
available (9) "

The spectrum is really something more like : "Probably Not Exploitable (1),
Exploitable(5), Reliably Exploitable (9)"

It is probably worth revisiting the model as a whole, and a team could also
provide a catalogue of sample threat agents and their scores as well.

Anyone else interested in working on this?

In my opinion the skill level of the threat agent is a variable of threat agent capability and ease of discover and exploit of the vulnerability. The other factors to consider for threat agent probability are the threat agent motivations. The threat agent skills would matter in the case the vulnerability is not easy to exploit (easiness  of exploit is low) such ad when it will require special skills on behalf of the attacker (or attackers) to conduct the exploit as well as capabilities (special tools). In that case, the higher the skill required and the use of not common attacking techniques and tools the lower the probability as the number of skilled and capable threat agent population able to perform the exploit would be low (e.g. script kiddies skills are low if what it takes to exploit is grabbing a pen test tool or free attack tool to exploit a common vulnerability and the probability of that exploit is high) the skill level therefore need to be commiserated to the difficulty of the exploit such as in the case the vulnerability is not a common one (e.g. OWASP T10) and requires special knowledge and tools of the threat agent to exploit it.

Hi Marco, while I understand and agree with some of the arguments both you and Yvan have made I'm really just looking for, either: 1) confirmation from the list that a mistake has been made at some point (see below), or 2) a suggestion as to who "owns" the risk rating methodology content that I should maybe be talking to instead.

(I've CC'd Jeff on this reply as he seems to have been involved in the creation of said wiki content, based on the wiki history).

The change seems to have occurred between these edits:

In my opinion the skill level of the threat agent is a variable of threat agent capability and ease of discover and exploit of the vulnerability. The other factors to consider for threat agent probability are the threat agent motivations. The threat agent skills would matter in the case the vulnerability is not easy to exploit (easiness  of exploit is low) such ad when it will require special skills on behalf of the attacker (or attackers) to conduct the exploit as well as capabilities (special tools). In that case, the higher the skill required and the use of not common attacking techniques and tools the lower the probability as the number of skilled and capable threat agent population able to perform the exploit would be low (e.g. script kiddies skills are low if what it takes to exploit is grabbing a pen test tool or free attack tool to exploit a common vulnerability and the probability of that exploit is high) the skill level therefore need to be commiserated to the difficulty of the exploit such as in the case the vulnerability is not a common one (e.g. OWASP T10) and requires special knowledge and tools of the threat agent to exploit it.

I think there is a more fundamental problem with the mathematics here,
and I've strayed away from this guide.

The different impact factors are ?averaged? together for a final
impact score, which absolutely makes no sense.

You can have a "loss of confidentiality" that is "off the chart" and
still have an overall low impact factor.

I think "use the max value per category"
is more appropriate.

Credit for this concern goes to Josh Sokol.

Jim, I think it would worth also to have the opinion of whom put the risk model together in the first place, perhaps it was not discussed and reviewed? Cheers, Marco

We need to keep in mind that Web App VA or PenTest shouldn't be trying to take the place of a true Threat and Risk Assessment. The activities should be completely separate. As VA or PenTest contractors we're likely to have all the details necessary to perform true TRA type risk calculations. I suspect this is why the wiki content suggests that the included methodology can (and should) be expended/extended as companies/organizations see fit.

Jim, I think it would worth also to have the opinion of whom put the risk model together in the first place, perhaps it was not discussed and reviewed? Cheers, Marco

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Are the Risk Rating Wiki Pages Broken?

Message-ID: <CE3955E4.8296%dimitri@bitcrack.net>

Since the wiki speaks about having a framework, and the point below which
I also agree with states that it should be expanded/extended as required -
perhaps it would be wise to rename it with Framework at the end? "Risk
Rating Methodology Framework"

That would imply its not cast in stone but rather it lays out a route,
shows you some examples and lets you build on that to fully customize it
around what your local threats and risks are, what your company's appetite
for risk is and thus application of a customized model as to how you will
classify your likelihood and impact.

Rick,

I when through my notes from 2009 today (Thursday) to resolve why the
<META> Tag section was not included in the OWASP Testing Guide v3.

The reason was there was a much higher chance of
robots/spiders/crawlers ignoring <META> Tag(s) then that of ignoring
the robots.txt in webroot.

Hence robots.txt in webroot is the preferred recommendation with
<META> Tag(s) listed as a secondary recommendation.

I guess the question I am trying to ask is should we now include
<META> Tag(s) in "Review Webserver Metafiles for Information Leakage"?

Hi Christian, thanks for pointing that out. I can definitely see the argument for CVSS (or CVSS'ish) score for Web App Vulns. The only thing that I might say against it is that while there is meant to be a temporal aspect to things I haven't really seen any CVSS scores adjusted over time. Further while this aspect is meant to be from discovery to exploit web app assessment would almost always end up on the exploit end of the scale. Because, If I've identified a XSS in someone's app then it's been exploited.

We should also keep in mind that work has been done in adapting the OSSTMM and its metrics for use in web app assessments.
http://seclists.org/webappsec/2010/q3/49
https://twitter.com/isecom/statuses/167973076301135872

Anyway, while that's still up in the air I'd like to do something with the existing wiki. Even if that is only to reverse the previous edit which sparked this thread. I'm was just really hoping that a few people would chime in with black or white (agreement or disagreement) on the topic.

Rick

Should we split this into four "INFO" tests all related to spidering then i.e.:
1. http://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html
2. robots.txt in webroot
3. SEO related <META> Tags i.e.
https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/79812?hl=en
4. HTML Comments i.e. <!-- ... //-->

CVSS is intended to provide a holistic approach in the priorities the

binary/bytecode (non web) applications,  Operating Systems, networks

OSSTMM is *not* developed in a transparent manner (i.e. closed source)
and this is demonstrated by
https://twitter.com/isecom/statuses/167973076301135872 i.e. there is
not public link within this tweet.

Furthermore, there are no web application security related published
bodies of work from http://www.isecom.org/team.html that are published
outside of ISECOM that I am aware of (I would welcome references that
prove this assumption is incorrect).

I can't agree that this would be a good use of your time due to the
imminent  release of CVSSv3 vs your expect outcome for the OWASP Risk
Rating Methodology.  Rather, it is more advantageous for OWASP to
deprecate this as other bodies of work related to risk management have
improved significantly overtime with multiple releases.

I am favor of endorsing MITRE's CVSS since this is almost widely accepted industry standard for vulnerability risk scoring. Nevertheless,  I think there is value in guiding users of the testing guide on the use of other qualitative risk assessment methodologies as a reference. Based upon my experience, organizations do not just rely on CVSS for vulnerability risk management but to their risk management process and acceptable risk levels. I think keeping the current OWASP risk scoring has value for comparison and can be corrected for the risk factors of threats vs risk factors of vulnerabilities (discussion on threat agent skills) and overall weight calculation formula as well as for covering at least five levels instead of three (H,M,L). The comparison between CVSS and OWASP risk rating can also be used as benchmark and to highlight that ultimately there is no one best risk methodology but consistent assessment of risk using different criteria.
One approach I like to educate users on how to assess risk is Josh's SimpleRisk tool where different risk assessment formulations can be used (even user defined) and compared to assess risk.

Hi Christian, I think we're all in agreement that the current methodology could be replaced or improved. I'm just looking for a quick fix (i.e. I can do it in mere seconds....there is no concern about it taking time) to address a client concern and what seems like an obvious mistake.

Even if CVSSv3 is out tomorrow (I suspect imminent for it actually means sometime this year...maybe), OWASP isn't going to adopt it the day after (even if we've established here that we should or could), and even further out is adoption by users/companies/organizations that currently leverage OWASP material.

So to the original point of this thread:
Do people agree or disagree that the current threat agent skill definition is backwards and that the edit (https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology&diff=133450&oldid=122921) should be reversed?

I think we need to be careful in how we frame titles etc related to <META> so that we're not implying that it only covers spidering/indexing related info/controls. <META> Also leaks information like technologies in use, also facilitates redirects, etc.

Should we split this into four "INFO" tests all related to spidering then i.e.:
1. http://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html
2. robots.txt in webroot
3. SEO related <META> Tags i.e.

CVSS is published by FIRST not MITRE.

ISO 31000 is the preferred risk management standard and is based on
the Australian Standard 4360 (published in 2004).  The most common
implementation of ISO 31000 to interoperate with CVSS is to insert a
single risk item related to technical vulnerabilities on the risk
registry (since the intended audience is the board of the respective
company).

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Issues_Concerning_The_OWASP_Top_Ten_2013,
and several other examples, prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
Aspect Security have leveraged the flawed OWASP Risk Rating for their
own commercial vested interests.

Furthermore the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology is not cited by
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling#Alternative_Threat_Modeling_Systems
i.e. the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology cites Threat Modelling (and
this wiki page) too.

I have not used https://code.google.com/p/simplerisk/ but Josh does
have an excellent understanding of managing business risk i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2013-May/011954.html (to

Compare this to the ongoing mess that Jeff Williams created when he

Since the issue was raised by your client I would recommend that
someone independent of you and your client perform the change on the
wiki otherwise the change will appear bias.

CVSSv3 is supported by an extensive list of stakeholders i.e.
http://www.first.org/cvss/eadopters, http://www.first.org/cvss/team
and  scroll down to the "Announcing the CVSS Special Interest Group
for CVSS v3 Development" section on
http://www.first.org/cvss/v3/development too.

That stated, this is the first instance I have known of where someone
other than Aspect Security has adopted their flawed risk rating
methodology :)  I'll assume that this was a copy paste from an OWASP
Top Ten finding?

Logically I don't disagree with you change but there may have been a
caveat that you may not have considered (and might have been the
original intent of this anomaly) i.e. that is an unskilled threat
agent is more dangerous (since they make more unintended mistakes)
than those who are highly skilled.

BTW, I have no idea as to the reason behind for a "5th" value is
missing i.e. refer to the change note of Soroush Dalili for
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology&diff=133450&oldid=122921

Christian, thanks for the correction in regarding CVSS origins. I think my confusion is from the fact that Steve Christey, of the MITRE Corporation, who edits Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is also member of FIRST but indeed this is not MITRE's child, CVE is, my fault.

I do not have a view on the other points you are making but I do not agree the OWASP risk methodology is "flawed" so it can be rejected entirely. I am in favor of a revision same as CVSS had revisions as well. In my opinion, I believe in "increased maturity through continuous improvements". I also think this discussion should be brought up to the people that are mentioned in this email so they can excise their opinion and we can have a fair discussion on this topic.

I am copying Tom if he things this discussion should be brought to a larger group including the authors of the OWASP risk methodology  :)

cheers, Marco

This error is not uncommon and due to their reading of "V" and "W" too
i.e. CVE and CWE

Also, the NVD is hosted within NIST not MITRE i.e.
http://nvd.nist.gov/ and NIST list their respective CVSSv2 Metrics
against their CVE entries.

I attempted to update the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology around the
release of the OWASP Testing Guide v3 and the OWASP Top Ten dated
2010.  My proposal also included making the RIsk Rating Methodology
independent from the Testing Guide.  This was resisted the project
leader (of the OWASP Testing Guide who I have deliberately not named)
at the time and I suspect it was due to Aspect Security dominance of
the OWASP Board.

Several former employees of Aspect Security have also taken subsequent
action to block their (Aspect Security's) further commercial
exploitation of OWASP, such as Jim Manico and
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2013-March/011679.html
are his comments related to the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.

I fail to see the advantage in attempting to catch up as OWASP has
lost its leadership position within several areas of Web Application
Security with other parties that have more mature risk management and
associated vulnerability patch and/or workaround frameworks.
Furthermore, these other parties have no resisted the inclusion of
external contributions as OWASP has in the past.

If you are interested in contributing to CVSSv3 then I can facilitate
an introduction to Seth for you?

I am not sure which "Tom" which you are referring too and neither is a
Tom listed within
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology&action=history.
 That stated I would advise against escalating this to the "Tom" who
is the subject within
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2008-September/006845.html
as it was Aspect Security that raised the objection in this specific
instance (of 2008).

Christian,

I initiated an email topic on this with Josh Sokol since he was the one that first reviewed the OWAASP risk methodology, found some flaws and suggested the changes. I personally like the methodology because of the choice of risk factors for probability of threat agents and vulnerabilities and for technical and business impact. This forces a risk manager to think about these factors for scoring risk. What I think need to be revised in the current methodology is the lack of context so cannot be misused. In the hand of a risk assessor with no technical and business context of these factors, the OWASP risk methodology can produce incorrect ratings since data can be entered that can cancel out factors in contradiction on each other (e.g. low threat agent skill level vs. low ease of exploit, loss of confidentiality  vs. non impact of privacy and no financial impact).  Also as per Josh point, the weighting averages should be given in a way not to cancel important factors. I personally think too that the weight factors of threat, vulnerability, technical impact and business impact separately otherwise we have same price for everything that we put in the grocery bag, apples and oranges, discounting that oranges (e.g. confidentiality), sorry got use to these analogies with my wife to simplify what I mean ..:)

My plan is to get this (as contributor of the testing guide) and work with Josh Sokol  to a set of proposal for changes and propose them include them in the next release. How does it sounds? 

I think after we agree on these changes, it will be also nice to put the OWASP risk methodology in online risk calculator with proper calculation of averages and set of contextual constraints (pivots on conditions of vulnerabilities and technical impact and greyed selections to avoid contradictions)   

For the time being, I think we should recommend the use of standard like CVSS vs2 to check the two ratings and also make sure who assign the risk values is an expert risk manager with clear understanding on the context of what is entering otherwise need to consult with one that does.

p.s. sorry for Tom I was referring to Tom Brennan, copied herein in the conversation. 

Cheers,

Marco

Rick,

I have added the <META NAME="ROBOTS example within
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Review_Webserver_Metafiles_for_Information_Leakage_(OTG-INFO-003)
due to its relevancy with Spiders/Robots/Crawlers from v3.

My recommendation would be to retain the original title from v3 and
define "Review_Webserver_Metafiles_for_Information_Leakage" as a
separate test within v4 for HTML Comments and other SEO related <META>
Tags..

Marco,

The intended audience for risk management aren't interested in threat
model or the "technicality" of a vulnerability, rather their
expectation is how the business manages risk outside of technology.
Hence, the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology would confuse risk managers
too and the reason for the simplistic approach of ISO 31000.

To dispel the myth that this is another OWASP effort which does not
contribute anything to webappsec I would recommend that you provide
the additional value that the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology  would
provide above ISO 31000 and CVSS?

Otherwise Josh would have a perceived conflict of interest as the
ulterior motive identified would be to promote
https://code.google.com/p/simplerisk/ while providing no actual value
to webappsec.  I don't believe this to be the case because I have seen
many examples of Josh highlighting "vendor neutrality" as he outlined
within https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2013_Board_Elections but once
accused of this the damage is already done.

I still recommend that the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology is
independent of the Testing Guide since this poor contribution from
Aspect Security is them attempting to promote themselves within the
Testing Guide itself without contributing anything of value i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2013-March/011679.html
(FYI Jim Manico is a former employee of Aspect Security and therefore
has "insider" knowledge of their poor business practices).

Also, quoting Tom Brennan as supporting your cause is actually
detrimental since his support for any initiative is based on the
undisputed fact that there is a benefit to him and/or his employer at
the time which has harmed the OWASP brand several times over without
correction i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2008-September/006845.html
and as a follow on the comments within
http://taosecurity.blogspot.com.au/2010/06/publicly-traded-companies-read-this.html
to the most recent incident being
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2013-July/012175.html

In conclusion, can you provide the additional value that the OWASP
Risk Rating Methodology would provide above ISO 31000 and CVSS if it
is not should it removed from the OWASP Testing Guide and marked as
aborted?

Hey now, the OWASP Risk Rating is a good start and possibly even a
good framework. It just needs an update. I also think that if you use
"highest impact" instead of the "average impact" the numbers fall out
better.

As for project sponsorship issues, we desperately need better rules of
play that are consistent across all projects. We really do not have
that right now.

The board is actively working on this and will submit a few proposals
for the membership community to vote on, and soon.

Aloha,

Jim,

"... For example, a SQL injection problem is frequently CRITICAL, but
it might also be a LOW risk finding if the database is already public
and only an administrator could possibly exploit the flaw. ..."  to
quote page 7 of
https://www.aspectsecurity.com/uploads/downloads/2013/06/Aspect-2013-Global-AppSec-Risk-Report.pdf.
 I can understand that risk manager might not comprehend technology
but even they have agreed with me that quote is the worst calculation
of inherent and residual risk that has ever been published.

Until I see what additional value that the OWASP Risk Rating
Methodology would provide above ISO 31000 and CVSS then it neither a
good start or framework for that matter.  Hence it should it removed
from the OWASP Testing Guide (since it taints what is otherwise good
work within the Testing Guide) and marked as aborted.

I happen to really like the Testing Guide Risk Rating Methodology
?
While it may be more simplistic than ISO 31000 and CVSS for the Testing Guide and its audience it is great.

In fact I believe that an organization starting out?will be able to easily take the charts and concepts/methodology?from this section and?make a?nice "results report".

Probably we need to include references to ISO 31000 and CVSS and start the methodology with some caveats and a broader theory with this methodology as the fact that this is an example.?

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
David

Christian, it looks you are going solo on throwing baby and bath water... also you keep discounting other peoples contributions and point of views on this. Please exercise restraint and consider other peoples point of views, you are not helping the discussion, sorry very disappointed.Cheers Marco

Great discussion :) 

Originally my thoughts concerning the inclusion of the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology in the Testing Guide aligned with Christian (i.e. OWASP does appsec, not risk). However, it may be prudent to "harmonize" the Methodology with 31000 or 27005 in much the same way that 2011 revision of 27005 was intended to align with 31000. Rather than regurgitate 31000 within an appsec context, I suggest OWASP provide domain knowledge to aid a risk manager applying 31000/27005 assess the risk of an application vulnerability (as per Christian's SQL example below). Nothing verbose, just points for evaluating threats, vulnerability severity, remediation, etc, that could be used as an annex to 31000 or 27005. 

I still believe that OWASP's mission is appsec, not risk management, but we should provide guidance to risk professionals who find themselves in our domain.

Andrew, 

Not sure want to enter in philosophical discussions about OWASP does Appsec not risk management. I believe that vulnerability risk management is in essence technical risk management and application security is integral part of it since an application is an asset whose confidentiality, integrity and availability risks as inherent of the data assets or introduced by the presence of vulnerabilities need to be risk assessed and managed as other organization assets.

To bring the discussion to where it started, I think we can put our brains and expertise to improve the OWASP risk methodology with little changes, putting the right averages and constraints.  So if this is what we would like to do you have my help as member of OWASP organization

Cheers,

Marco

P.S. Can you elaborate how OWASP risk management methodology can be positively influenced by ISO 31000. Does the ISO 31000 provides a framework for managing risks ? So 31000 can be a guidance for assessing and managing risk but not specifically for calculating the factors of risk for threat agents, vulnerabilities, technical impact and business impact as the OWASP risk formula does. Are you saying that we should provide a framework and not a risk calculation formula?

Hi Christian,

I'm aware of your work on CVSSv3 from your posts on the DailyDave
list. As far as I can tell it's not done yet or there's no further
development except what's posted here:
http://www.first.org/cvss/v3/development
There doesn't seem to be a public link. So it seems to be a closed
development group as I couldn't easily see how I could get a copy of
of cvssv3 to read. It's just not developed in a transparent manner.

Then again maybe that's all perspective.

OSSTMM is also developed by a team of volunteers and to gain access to
the development you need to help work on it or financially support
development. When it's done we publish it for free as Open Source as
we have 8 other times before this coming version 4. It helps us keep
the project alive as well as keeping people from using an unfinished
version and being unsatisfied, never to return again even once it's
been improved. More than unsatisfied, the importance of security
testing and measurements is so vital to many organizations that we
need to be REALLY sure they know what is experimental and what isn't
so as not to aide in someone screwing up a test for following an
incomplete instruction set. And the team/subscriber hoop people need
to jump through solves that problem.

There's a lot of way to do open source and there's a lot of ways to
provide transparency. We do it through our teams and our lists as they
also suggest here:

http://opensource.com/life/13/7/10-secrets-open-source-communities

If you wanted to see and try the OSSTMM web app testing in development
you could have let us know and done some review for us or at least
give feedback if you were going to read it anyway. But you didn't
contact anyone in the team and you didn't ask for a copy anywhere I
can see. Just like I didn't with CVSSv3 when I didn't find it right
away. But I didn't call it closed source or not transparent. It is
what it is and if I think I need it, I'll ask. Just like many students
using OSSTMM in there thesis ask us for a copy of the latest stuff and
we give it to them because they give back by applying our stuff in
real and new ways.

By the way, we did introduce the document within OWASP at a public
meeting to get feedback from web developers and testers:
http://seclists.org/webappsec/2010/q3/49

Sorry if this escaped your notice. But we do them every once in a
while so maybe you can catch the next somewhere, even on your continent.

And by the way, I'm all for an OWASP Risk Rating. I think risk ratings
are quite personal so they offer an interesting perspective based on
the concerns of the organization developing them. They expand the
thought field of security and help people frame what's important to
them in the realm of that metric. With a field as big and imprecise as
security we need all the new ideas we can get.

Sincerely,
-pete.

OSSTMM is *not* developed in a transparent manner (i.e. closed source)
and this is demonstrated by
https://twitter.com/isecom/statuses/167973076301135872 i.e. there is
not public link within this tweet.

Furthermore, there are no web application security related published
bodies of work from http://www.isecom.org/team.html that are published
outside of ISECOM that I am aware of (I would welcome references that
prove this assumption is incorrect).

I can't agree that this would be a good use of your time due to the
imminent  release of CVSSv3 vs your expect outcome for the OWASP Risk
Rating Methodology.  Rather, it is more advantageous for OWASP to
deprecate this as other bodies of work related to risk management have
improved significantly overtime with multiple releases.

The link to the CVSS-SIG is prominently displayed on the left side of
the http://www.first.org/ homepage

Furthermore, all patents and other intellectual property rights have
to be surrendered to participate in the development of the CVSS and as
far as I am aware this is above what even OWASP requires.

OWASP has also followed a similar "secret" process as

Yes, I have been familiar with OSSTMM since release v2 (maybe earlier)
from memory.  The reason that I walked away from it was that it was
full of self righteous statements related to ethics and "Hacking
Exposed" has more technical content while being what is a
sensationalised publication (i.e. "Hacking Exposed").

Neither would the markings of both "Alpha" and "Draft" convince me to
read your webappsec methodology since it doesn't have the same peer
reviewed contributors as the OWASP Testing Guide,
http://mdsec.net/wahh/, etc.

Raoul Chiesa and I know each other from presenting at the same
conference in Europe. Coincidently he want me to replace
http://msmvps.com/blogs/spywaresucks/archive/2011/12/10/1803461.aspx
as the Australian representative for  http://www.isecom.org/team.html
because of their well known lack of skill.

After watching the heckling from the audience at
http://www.sector.ca/speakers2008.htm#Pete_Herzog I can't see the
additional value in travelling to North Carolina.  I believe the
positive reviews of the North Carolina event are attributed to Michael
Menefee not disclosing his conflict of interest i.e.
http://www.isecom.org/team.html.

This endorsement of the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology is the similar
to that from people who believe vulnerability assessment is a
different name of penetration testing and therefore consider OSSTMM as
a creditable body of knowledge.

Due to criticisms of OSSTMM from multiple parties with no relationship
to each other (hence no collusion) i.e.
http://infosecwarrior.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/ptes-penetration-testing-execution-standard/,
https://twitter.com/mhackling/status/46376971336290304, etc OWASP has
aligned itself with PTES too i.e.
https://twitter.com/indi303/status/78476821305360385 and
https://twitter.com/brennantom/status/78431000081858560.

Your conclusion is incorrect based on this sequence of events shows
that approached the OWASP Testing Guide Project Leader to update the
OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.

1. Just after the release of the OWASP Top Ten 2010 based on the well
known dependency of these two bodies of work to each other.

2. The intention at the time was to merge the OWASP Risk Rating
Methodology into CVSSv2 (which I had presented in 2007 i.e.
http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/cvss) and then with AS/NZS ISO
31000:2009 in consultation with the relevant committee within Standard
Australia.

The above was rejected from the outset by OWASP at the time due to a
political dispute between the Project Leader and Aspect Security.

Subsequently I have asked you and/or Josh for two artifacts that
compare the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology to:
1. CVSSv3 (or CVSSv2) and;
2. ISO 31000:2009

If you lack the understanding of both of these two bodies of work then
the proposal to update the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology is not
applicable to the intended audience (i.e. risk managers) and the level
of innovation and value add to the webappsec community is unknown and
therefore will cause confusion in an already crowded market place.

Hence, the recommendation to abort/deprecate/etc the OWASP Risk Rating
Methodology.

We don't need to abort it. Why not just make it better and/or list
some of the problems with it? I'm fairly loud and aggressive regarding
pointing out vendor neutrality issues, and I do not see this as a
violation as it stands today.

Perhaps the testing guide can list several of these rating systems and
let the tester decide what to choose?

Christian, I'm aiming for a softer approach because at the end of the
day we are all just volunteers, even those that may have been abusive
in the past.

Unless evidence is produced which demonstrates that the proposed
changes to the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology are innovative over CVSS
and ISO 31000 then OWASP will cause nothing more than confusion in the
market and further loss position as the leader of the webappsec field
to ISECOM and others.

http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2013-March/011679.html is
dated less than six months ago which is in the last hour if yesterday
was when I proposed to update the OWASP Risk Rating in 2010.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Issues_Concerning_The_OWASP_Top_Ten_2013
is more recent (June), or last 15 minutes :) and proves that the OWASP
Risk Rating Methodology was manipulated for Aspect Security for
commercial gain.

We have https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling already
and co-incidentally this doesn't list the OWASP Risk Rating
Methodology.

I have offered a resolution to Marco (and Josh) already that if there
is no evidence to support that an update to the OWASP Risk Rating
Methodology would provide what is already available within CVSS or ISO
31000 today then I am more than willing to facilitate an introduction
to the CVSS-SIG (unfortunately I can't assist with ISO directly but I
could approach Standards Australia for a contact of a standards body
within their respective country).

Pete,

I addressed a similar e-mail at
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-August/002211.html
but  I figured I would take you up on your offer and see if
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001)
was within the OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf and here are the steps below:

1. Upon clicking
https://www.isecom.org/silverteam/OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf I was
redirected to https://www.isecom.org/members/plugins/protect/new_rewrite/login.php?v=-1,2,13,7,14,5&url=/silverteam/OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf

2. I clicked "Signup here" i.e. "Not registered yet? Signup here"

3. Silver Registration is listed as $99 USD on
https://www.isecom.org/members/signup.php

Therefore, since I refuse to pay and your recent offer was to provide
me this free of charge I can only conclude that
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001)
is not part of OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf  since after Telstra had
assured the public that it would never happen again i.e.
http://conference.auscert.org.au/conf2012/speaker_Scott_McIntyre.html
and after extensive audits where undertaken by I assume
http://www.purehacking.com/about-us/our-team, who "... are regular
contributors the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual
(OSSTMM), certified Trainers of Penetration Testing Professionals of
OSSTMM, ..."  http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/oops-google-search-reveals-private-telstra-customer-data-20130516-2jnmw.html
occurred almost 1.5 years later or almost five years after the
publication of the OWASP Testing Guide v3.

Also, http://www.wireheadsecurity.com/owasp-nc-october-2010-with-pete-herzog-from-isecom
-> http://www.meetup.com/owaspnc/events/14603102/ ->
http://www.isecom.org/team.html shows the conflict of interest of
OWASP NC Chapter and ISECOM.

Hello All,
My opinion, as a previous lead of the testing guide is that the decision to keep risk rating in or remove it is the team leaders. Everyone has the right to voice their opinion without being flamed. Please respect that the guide is a collaboration but the team lead is the leader if the project.

Eoin,

Marco isn't a Project Leader and neither have I disagreed with Andrew Muller.

To me this seems to OWASP Risk Rating Methodology appears to be when
you stated that  "... In future the GPC should be able to prevent such
silliness in terms of what can become an OWASP branded solution and
what is snake oil."  to quote
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2010-July/003295.html

In light of your above statement, I would like to know how the OWASP
Risk Rating Methodology became part of the OWASP Testing Guide and not
the OWASP Top Ten where it is extensively referenced and how neither
ISO 31000 or CVSS were considered based on your own QA?

Hi Christian, to your last point I have considered this. However rating skill (i.e.: experience and training) based on things like "beginners' luck" or "accidents" doesn't really fit the model. 

While an unskilled individual may through bungling discover a DoS vuln etc I would expect a skilled individual to find the same and likely be able to leverage it to greater effect.

Therefore it seems logical to revert the edit which reversed the Threat Agent Skill ratings. As seems to have been agreed upon by various replies on the mailing list and discussions outside of the mailing list. I'll wait a day or two for further feedback and then make the edit.

There is no bias issue, as:
1) I was raising this as a community issue.
2) This is all documented publically.
3) I provide elements (such as severity (worst case), likelihood, exploitability, remediation effort [all from my team's point of view or experience]) which might feed into a client's risk assessment or calculation but I'm not responsible for such assessment or calculation, nor are the elements I provide the only basis for such assessments or calculations.

Rick

Since the issue was raised by your client I would recommend that
someone independent of you and your client perform the change on the
wiki otherwise the change will appear bias.

CVSSv3 is supported by an extensive list of stakeholders i.e.
http://www.first.org/cvss/eadopters, http://www.first.org/cvss/team
and  scroll down to the "Announcing the CVSS Special Interest Group
for CVSS v3 Development" section on
http://www.first.org/cvss/v3/development too.

That stated, this is the first instance I have known of where someone
other than Aspect Security has adopted their flawed risk rating
methodology :)  I'll assume that this was a copy paste from an OWASP
Top Ten finding?

Logically I don't disagree with you change but there may have been a
caveat that you may not have considered (and might have been the
original intent of this anomaly) i.e. that is an unskilled threat
agent is more dangerous (since they make more unintended mistakes)
than those who are highly skilled.

BTW, I have no idea as to the reason behind for a "5th" value is
missing i.e. refer to the change note of Soroush Dalili for
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology&diff=133450&oldid=122921

"We provide our research here openly for all to learn with us. All
projects are open for involvement or further study. Your involvement
assures each project gets reviewed from within new constraints, a new
perspective, and a new mind. So do contact us with your comments,
criticisms, doubts, or if you want to help further a project along."

And from OSSTMM.org:

"If you are interested in helping with this project please contact us."

But you didn't contact us. We didn't receive a mail that says you are
interested in reviewing and working with the Web App Draft and so
nobody could send it to you. I understand that you don't want to pay
for access but I think you could afford an e-mail to us, right?

As for your disdain for Ty Miller in yet another mail, okay, we get
it, you can find a few links that talk about Telstra but that in no
way proves the fault of the tester. Your ability to analyze and deduct
is seriously flawed. Your faulty logic of Telestra -> PureHacking ->
Ty -> Team Members -> ISECOM leads to "OSSTMM bad" is laughable.

And then you end your message with the bit about conflict of interest
with Mike Menefee/OWASP/ISECOM. Really? In 2 open source
organizations? Does that mean they need to be open to everyone but
each other because they are in the same industry? Really? A little
secret- many many people are in multiple, open organizations and it's
a good thing because that's how ideas spread and innovation grows.

I do appreciate your efforts to bring these things to my attention.
I'll work on making the contributor thing more transparent so as not
to lose any more possible volunteers.

Sincerely,
-pete.

Can you provide me the link to the document as I still can't find it.
I found a presentation, a letter, and some stuff but not the CVSSv3
document itself.

How is it secret if anyone can join? If I hold a party in a room and
invite everyone as long as they bring something or help set the tables
is it a secret party because you didn't come?

There'll always be haters. But what you point to is the Rules of
Engagement which were designed to protect the tester not force ethics
on them. You don't have to follow them to do an OSSTMM test but they
will help you as a security professional. Too often pen testers were
caught in Catch22 situations where they did their job but the
remediation wasn't done or some contract details were missing, or the
client made the scope too narrow and then there were problems, the
company gets hacked, and people point and say, XYZ did our security!
And XYZ signed an NDA that doesn't let them refute or explain that
they tested under restrictions or had nothing to do with remediation.

Anyway, we never wanted to compete with hacking exposed. We're a
research organization looking for the best way to test and analyze
operations to secure them. That's enough work without trying to detail
how to exploit each bug that might not even be a technology in use
tomorrow.

Okay. Sorry we lost you then.

I like Ty and I think he's a capable tester. You posting a link to a
blog where someone states their opinion doesn't prove a "well known
lack of skill". And Raoul has never said anything to me about this but
I'm happy to include him here (in CC). I can't imagine he said to
replace Ty as we don't "replace" people on the team, we grow it.
Because we can all learn things from each other.

The link you post about Ty's skill again goes back to what I said
about that Catch 22. I don't know details or have access to the
confidential security reports as you apparently do but when I see that
I see so many possibilities where someone got it wrong that I don't
immediately blame the tester. There's the scope of the test,
restrictions on types of tests, remediation, etc. I just hope you
never find yourself in that situation as it can happen to ANY tester.

I'm just so glad they didn't do it out loud as that would have thrown
me off my presentation! I didn't even know about it. It was hard
enough since I was presenting on the New New Thieves, which was based
on work that Raoul Chiesa (you mentioned above as your endorsement)
pioneered with the United Nations for profiling hackers.

Mike joined ISECOM about a month after that event. I don't see how
that's a conflict of interest to invite me as a speaker either though.
As an example of what might be a conflict of interest is someone
trying to shut down OWASP risk metrics because of their work CVSS v3.
But that's just an opinion too.

I really don't follow that line of thinking. But I do believe nobody
sits on all the great ideas- no person and no group. I think people
should work in the areas they see they can improve because of their
specialized knowledge and even if it's not a flawless body of work,
there are still likely to be some worthwhile ideas in it. Having
worked with attack surface metrics on web apps I know it is hard and
so I'm interested to see how another approaches it. And that's how
science works.

OSSTMM is neither vuln testing or pen testing. It's a methodology
which shows that no matter what you call what you do, you need to get
XYZ intelligence from it so you know where your problems are. If you
can do that with a vuln scanner or a red team or a magic wand, that's
okay.

Research is supposed to have critics. That's how progress happens. And
then whenever you put yourself out there, well, there'll always be
haters. That's life.

So some blog that makes up a percentage in passing about the OSSTMM
and 3 twitter feeds is "multiple criticisms"? Your old drama teacher
must be proud.

Stop being so negative and so conflicted and just enjoy that there's
so many people trying to figure out how best to secure the world.
There's a lot of work to do so just do your thing and stop trying to
block others from doing theirs.

Hi Christian,

The Robots thing has been in the OSSTMM since version 1. So it is in
the OSSTMM App Sec methodology. But thanks. I'll look into the other
things you sent but I won't be able to answer by Sept 3. I will get to
you as soon as possible.

We'll continue this off list.

Sincerely,
-pete.

Pete,

I would appreciate if you could consolidate the multiple threads you
have created on the OWASP Testing Guide Mailing List around the same
subject into a single thread if you have something more to add.

Also Raoul, Ty (once his new e-mail address is known) and Michael are
more then welcome to subscribe to the mailing list as per the simple
instructions listed at
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing which I assume
is the reason that these multiple threads are created as you left off
one or more e-mail addresses?

CVSSv3 is still under active development i.e. I believe this was

If you understood this thread on the Top Ten Mailing List then OWASP
tends to lean towards transparency (including the refusal of NDAs).
This policy tends to be enforced when it suits the ulterior motive of
the person i.e for an example of OWASP own hypocrisy related to the
thread on the Top Ten Mailing List then refer to later paragraphs from
Jeff within https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-August/006011.html

Well is appears "regular contributors the Open Source Security Testing
Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), certified Trainers of Penetration Testing
Professionals of OSSTMM" from Pure Hacking are "...regularly .."
caught out making inaccurate claims "... in Australia?s media." time

The above doesn't convince me that you intent is to otherwise extract
as much revenue out of the market while being in denial about high
level understanding required to maintain the state of the art.

OSSTMM has been in a steady decline which has upheld my first impression.

To select one of several stories that I have heard, it took a
webappsec subcontractor to "Pure Hacking" 1 hour to bypass a simple
authentication framework which Ty Miller had wasted two days
attempting to figure out without any tangible result.

I'll locate the e-mail(s) from Raoul and send them to you but I would
have preferred not to do this since my brief dealings with Raoul have
always been positive since we avoided discussing his association with
convicted criminal Kevin Mitnick e.g.

Since my other recent e-mail hasn't been reflected in the mailing list
archive where I addressed this I'll predict it will be found at
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-August/date.html
later today.

I won't have interpreted that as an endorsement otherwise I would have
contributed to OSSTMM.

Coincidently what you may have heard about
http://cmlh.id.au/tagged/grubbgate wasn't an accurate version of
events of what I presented at Security B-Sides in 2011 and you may
also want to pay particular attention to
http://cmlh.id.au/post/57402913158/jodymelbourne-doxed

To link this back to "Pure Hacking", I was disappointed when Ty
attempt to exploit this unfortunate situation for "Pure Hacking" gain
i.e. http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/facebook-images-open-to-access/story-e6frgakx-1226059138255,
http://www.zdnet.com.au/stuxnet-routing-hacks-and-a-seized-ipad-339315484.htm,
etc in light of:
1.  "Pure Hacking" appearance on
http://www.sbs.com.au/insight/episode/transcript/30/Stolen-IDTV and
associated comments hyped with delusion of grandeurs.
2.  "Pure Hacking" reversal on seeking permission from the end user of
social network i.e. content on social networks is public domain i.e.
http://www.zdnet.com/penetration-testing-employees-social-media-to-improve-policy-7000017234/.
 Their claim about "no one else in the world is currently doing" is
pure fabrication too due to my prior work and that of Tom Ryan i.e.
"Robin Sage", IOActive i.e. "The Leaky Web: Owning Your Favorite
CEOs", etc

I have no association with the development of CVSSv3 aside from
http://cmlh.id.au/post/25150772855/cvssv3-call-subjects which was open
to the public.  I am *not* a member of the CVSS-SIG.

Rather, I recommend CVSS because it is assists in prioritising the
workaround and/or patches from multiple vendors.

The difference is that scientists publish in journals, of majority are

This wasn't the purpose of the 2.2 (or earlier) release of OSSTMM (I
remember it had alot of content about nmap results) but I can't
comment on the more recent releases since I haven't read them.

If ISECOM had been less concerned about creating profit and more
concerned with the implementation of transparency as part of the
development of OSSTMM then possibly the people saw the potential of
OSSTMM would be promoting on your behalf today.

There is no collusion between these parties so each opinion can be
considered independent.

I will state again that one of these parties is an OWASP Board Member.

I neither have the power or desire to politically block people within
OWASP.  Rather I am attempting to guide people to better alternatives,
such as CVSS and ISO 31000 based on my own experience with the OWASP
Risk Rating Methodology.

Marco, Josh and anyone else is more than welcome disregard my advice
and update the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.

Snippy much? As a fellow researcher I am aware when something is under
development and if it's other research then these things are always in
some state of development.

No matter who contributes, all research is vetted. We don't vet
people, just what they contribute. As Mike mentioned, there are some
things we've still debated on list for years.

No inaccurate name dropping. I remember. This was to prevent audit
companies who did non sec work, like an e-mail implementation at
well-known company XYZ, to say XYZ was a past client. There is a lot
of lies and fraud in the pen test industry claiming to have done
things they haven't. It also prevented breaks in NDA. What was allowed
was for the companies themselves to give recommendations. We were just
trying to get at more accurate referrals. Again, a recommendation and
not a requirement.

It wasn't meant to. Of course we do need to earn money to continue our
research. We have some very large, costly projects that bring
absolutely zero return financially, like Hacker Highschool. But I
wouldn't say we're trying to "extract as much revenue" because there
are many things we don't do.

> 
> OSSTMM has been in a steady decline which has upheld my first impression.

Based on what research? 4 tweets and a blog? I'd love to see your
research. Don't bother if it's informal. I have actual numbers that
show it's not. We shifted as we came to understanding about the
inadequacies of pen testing and vuln scanning as well as many of the
ways security has been "productized". That lost us people in those
areas, like you apparently, but it gained us much more in other areas.
It wasn't our intention. We just followed the facts of the research
and adjusted the methodology accordingly.

Many many people talk to Kevin. And as far as I can tell, he's no
longer a convicted criminal unless he just went back to jail....

Again, there are many variables. And all you can provide is anecdotal
and indirect evidence.

Again, what I'm interested in is ideas and contributions from Ty. We
get contributions from everywhere and I'm not going to discount good
work because other people don't like the way a certain person behaves
professionally. And all this coming from you who was against the
"ethics" in the OSSTMM!


>

Okay, well, at ISECOM we don't advocate patching except for features
and under change control procedures. Therefore we don't see the need
for CVSS. We prioritize security remediation by operation and not risk.

> The difference is that scientists publish in journals, of majority are

Do those scientists make open all their work while they're working on
it? No. Just their team sees it. We also publish for free.

Yes, and we were wrong. We followed research from the industry and it
mislead us until we figured out that security was impossible that way.
So we took 7 years to restart our research from the ground up and came
out with OSSTMM 3. All stuff I've said publicly.

Again, it's free for anyone to join and contribute to the team and you
have access.

But it's still just opinions. I can go online and find 3 twitter posts
and a blog post that says smoking is good but that doesn't make it true.

Yes, and he didn't mention OSSTMM. Choosing something is a preference
and an opinion.

I hope at least that you learn from our exchange is that things change
and evolve and you shouldn't be dismissive of things because you
didn't like the old version. I mean, you did support a new version of
CVSS despite version 1 being pretty bad.

Let's take this exchange offline from here on out.

"OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf" as part of your initial response would have
shown that ISECOM had nothing to hide.

Please don't consider this an invitation to provide this to me now as
I will declare the that I can't confirm in a transparent manner that
your document hasn't subsequently been altered.

I have "insider" knowledge of this as I employed by Telstra to deliver
Vulnerability Assessment related services to three of the four major
banks and resolving disputes related to Penetration Testing undertaken
by the bank themselves against Telstra.

During this time there was a discussion put forward at a much higher
level for my scope to increase to include the services that "Pure
Hacking" delivered to Telstra due to concerns around their lack of
both quality and talent since I have was well known for exploiting
subtle by high severity vulnerabilities not discovered by "Pure
Hacking" who had performed multiple audits that listed the QA
undertaken by Ty Miller.

As a result of http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/telstra-customer-database-exposed-20111209-1on60.html,
this discussion was raised again since I would have tested for this
based since it is reflective of my contribution to the OWASP Testing
Guide and hence would have reflected my high standing within the
industry.

In addition and after several complaints against Pure Hacking within
OWASP, starting with
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2006-November/005317.html,
Tom Brennan (OWASP) had also independently sought references from
people well known  who have some association with "Pure Hacking" and
also formed the same conclusion about their lack of webappsec ability.

In future I would suggest that you undertake some more background
research next time (Also Ty Miller left Pure Hacking recently)?

ISECOM have repeated the "marketing" mistake of Foundstone from 2003
i.e. http://web.archive.org/web/20030801110134/http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1739

In future you could portray these as a success story for ISECOM and
OWASP while disclosing your conflict of interest too in a positive way
i.e. "... I [Pete] presented at OWASP NC and the Chapter Leader wanted
to contribute to OSSTMM ..."

If I was you then I would have invited me and all the other critics of
OSSTTM to become listed contributors from the onset of their criticism
against ISECOM?

Michael,

Based on what you have stated I am willing to reconsider OSSTMM so to
move forward how about this:

1.  I'll contribute
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001)
to the OSSTMM_Web_App_Draft.pdf since this will resolve the
correlation of http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/telstra-customer-database-exposed-20111209-1on60.html
to OSSTMM.
2.  I'll report back to OWASP on my experience with ISECOM.
3.  If my experience with ISECOM is also positive (based on your own
observations) then I'll correlate the OWASP Testing Guide v4 to OSSTMM
Web Application Methodology

If you are after examples of 3. above then it would be similar to the
comparison of the OWASP Top Ten and MITRE/SANS Top 25 I have produced
in the past, i.e. https://github.com/cmlh/OWASP-Top-Ten-2013 and
https://github.com/cmlh/Top-25 respectively , but on much larger in
scale.

I believe this is a win win for both OWASP and ISECOM and please let
me know off list if ISECOM would like to suggest consideration of a
reasonable alternative or develop additional items to those above?

Can we aim to finalise this by next Tuesday morning (3 September) to
allow for ISECOM to discuss this internally too?

CVSSv3 isn't "research", rather its a standard where multiple
stakeholders vote on the inclusion of subject solicited from the
community.  There is no money exchanged.

OSSTMM is a perpetually closed draft created without seek community
(i.e. outside of ISECOM membership) consensus.

FIRST had a "Call for Participants" and their selection was
vetted/approved by the FIRST Board.

ISECOM have to accept anyone because there is no value in being
associated with your brand and therefore no competition for placement.
 I would welcome ISECOM to host a similar "Call for Participants" in
order to prove this statement incorrect?

I would be interest to know then as to why "Pure Hacking", who
contribute to OSSTMM and subsequently claim to adhere to the OSSTMM,
and are well known to deliver poor and incomplete testing i.e.
http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/telstra-customer-database-exposed-20111209-1on60.html
have continued to be allow to contribute to the OSSTMM in light of the

In light of http://aussieinnovation.com/directory/243, my reply is
based on the two posts to Pastebin within
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Mar/204 and the subsequent
tweets of https://twitter.com/hacklabsjody

http://www.flickr.com/photos/35004584 at N00/3286383607/ is the

http://www.pentest-standard.org/ was created due to the lack of
technical direction and lack of vigor required for the OSSTMM.

I am fairly well known for developing my own webappsec exploits.
However, I have provided an independent opinion on Pure Hacking
deliverables for companies in the past and these findings has included
the identification of the webappsec product and the level of vigor was
identified was that of the lowest level i.e. automation only i.e. Pure
Hacking has listed a number of false positives as filler and padding
of their deliverable.

This isn't anecdotal evidence if the same conclusion is drawn by

Hacking"

The ulterior motive the recent offer to contribute to OSSTMM is based
on the likelihood that it will be refused since politically I can
claim that I tried to contribute but your pride prohibited me.

Please refer to the dispute above related to your use of the term

The Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability vector of the Base
Metric of CVSS have no relationship to the risk defined within ISO
31000.

I would assume CIA defined within CVSS is more relevant to how you
defined them too.

Scientific research is peered reviewed by those outside of their team.
 "peer review" by the larger security community isn't engaged by
ISECOM.

If ISECOM had created a new "brand" based on a fork of OSSTMM (which
would also be deprecated) then I don't believe you would continue to
experience the same level of resistance today.

I don't believe these blog posts exist and if they did it would be in

I did support CVSSv1 based on my prior knowledge of Mike Schiffman's
other research in low level network packet manipulation i.e.

You should have done this in the first instance since this thread has
no relevance to the OWASP Testing Guide.

If this is the case then Ty (or "Pure Hacking) are more than welcome
to provide the reason for this perceived deficiency in their delivery
of the OSSTMM prior to December 2011 i.e.
http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/telstra-customer-database-exposed-20111209-1on60.html
and their continued failure after [I assume] "Pure Hacking" to correct
this deficiency in their continued application of the OSSTMM from
December 2011 through to May 2013 i.e.
http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/oops-google-search-reveals-private-telstra-customer-data-20130516-2jnmw.html

Also, can you send the relevant quote from the OSSTMM (a release which
is available to the public without a paid subscription) to me so I can
include a reference to it within the
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001)
 please?

David,

ISO 31000 is much simpler to implement then the complexity of the
OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.

Furthermore, CVSS has already addressed the shortcoming of the OWASP
Risk Rating Methodology, such as the lack of independence and bias
shown in Aspect Security (its author's) own application of it:

1. CVSSv2 Base Scores are vetted by OSVDB and NIST independently of
each other i.e. the announcement from OSVDB was made within
https://lists.immunityinc.com/pipermail/dailydave/2013-August/date.html
but hasn't been reflected in the mail archive yet.

2. "... For example, a SQL injection problem is frequently CRITICAL,
but it might also be a LOW risk finding if the database is already
public and only an administrator could possibly exploit the flaw. ..."
 to quote page 7 of
https://www.aspectsecurity.com/uploads/downloads/2013/06/Aspect-2013-Global-AppSec-Risk-Report.pdf
is an incorrect determination of residual business risk.

3. The inclusion of A9 in the OWASP Top Ten 2013 to promote the
business interests of Sonatype based on bias and questionable research
conducted by Aspect Security on behalf of Sonatype i.e.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Issues_Concerning_The_OWASP_Top_Ten_2013

4. Aspect Security have caused catastrophic brand damage to OWASP by
failing to manage the business risk of OWASP Members grievances, such
as http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2013-March/011679.html,
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2011-January/009563.html,
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2013-August/012322.html,
etc.  Furthermore, some of these OWASP Members were  also employees of
Aspect Security but quit [Aspect Security] in disgust.

Therefore, my continued recommendation to OWASP has been to contribute
to CVSSv3.  I haven't identified any content from the OWASP Risk
Rating Methodology that has been addressed by CVSSv2 already but I
would welcome anyone to correct my understanding?

Hi guys,
  Here cometh the whip! ;) We're nearing the end of the August sprint on
the Test Guide and there is still lots to be done. There have been some
excellent articles submitted by some of the world's leading webappsec
researchers and testers.

If you're unable to continue contributing, or you feel you've
over-committed, then please let us know and we'll help you out. Some folks
are working offline and then posting the final version to the wiki, so the
wiki isn't the final word on where the Test Guide is at.

If you could please give us an update on your progress, we can plan our
next move.

Thanks again for your efforts in helping us revamp the Test Guide!

regards,
   Andrew
