Since v3 is maintained via a wiki what is the plan for releasing/publishing updated PDF and Word versions?

Every quarter? Yearly? After a certain number or scope of change(s)?

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Owasp Testing Guide - Inclusion of New Web Attack
	Vectors
Message-ID: <1604.59.94.208.76.1242536391.squirrel@www.secniche.org>


Hi Community

I want to talk to you regarding the new attack vectors noticed this year
which can circumvent the security of web applications. I have released two
papers and real world advisories in Google and Oracle products. Still the
web applications which are deployed in custom manner vulnerable to these
attacks.

The release papers are indicated below:

http://secniche.org/papers/SNS_09_01_Evad_Xss_Filter_Msword.pdf
http://secniche.org/papers/SNS_09_03_PDF_Silent_Form_Re_Purp_Attack.pdf
http://secniche.org/gmd_hijack/gc_hijack.xhtml

These type of attacks are big concern to web applications running in real
world.

Please let us know about you review regarding these attack vectors for the
possible inclusion in the OWASP testing guide and which section will be 
suitable for these type of attacks.

Your all opinions are welcomed and will be highly appreciated in hitting
the right path.


Kind Regards
