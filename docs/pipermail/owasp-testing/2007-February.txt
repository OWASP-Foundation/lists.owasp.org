Message-ID: <f3193c100702010500t158a532lfa8b5ade617548dd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
The OWASP Live CD  (Release Candidate 1) is available.
It contains many of the OWASP tools and also the new Testing guide and the
development Guide.
It also has learning tools such as webgoat, some exploit engines
(metasploit) and tools such as wireshark and other information gathering
tools.
I'll be demoing it at the next meeting (13th Feb) anyways.
Its not a small download (circa 800MB). available at
http://www.packetfocus.com/hackos/AOC_Labrat-ALPHA-0010.iso

cya,
Eoin

Hi everyone,

 

Aspect sponsored Rogan to create a wiki-to-openoffice-to-pdf procedure.
Currently, it provides basic translation with a few hiccups (images and
pre-formatted text), so there are some manual steps.  But it should save a
lot of time.  Hopefully he'll be able to work out the last kinks.

 

Ultimately, I want to get to where we can do quarterly releases with all the
updates from the wiki on all of our documents!

That's perfect!
Rogan, can we work together to produce the v2 by next 10th Febraury?
I'm working to add manually all the updated to the v2 RC1 doc.

Yes, sure. I have it working correctly for images as well now 
(wiki191.owasp.org did not have the images copied over previously), as 
well as presenting items from <pre> blocks on separate lines instead of 
running them all into one.

Ideally, it should use a different style for that, so it can stand out, 
or be formatted appropriately.

One thing I did notice in the wikitext is that there is a fair amount of 
HTML embedded. e.g. there are a whole bunch of <br> elements, which mess 
up the formatting.

e.g. try http://wiki191.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Guide_Introduction

Anyway, to test this, go to 
http://wiki191.owasp.org/index.php/Special:Wiki2XML, provide a list of 
articles, and choose OpenOffice ODT output.

(Obviously, this assumes that you have an OpenDocument-capable 
word-processor to view the output)

A test set of articles might be:

Testing_Guide_Foreword
Testing_Guide_Frontispiece
About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project
Testing_Guide_Introduction

Let me know how it goes.

Hi all.

First of all, congratulations for the effort to produce the guide: I
think it will be a very useful resource for everybody who deals with
the security of web applications.

I've completed a thorough review of section 2 (Introduction) (I know,
a little late ;-)). I have a bunch of minor (typos, style issues) and
not-so-minor issues that I would like to address. I understand some of
the issues might come from having followed the project only recently,
so please forgive me if I'm repeating things that have already been
debated tens of times. In any case, I have written the most important
things on the discussion page
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Talk:Testing_Guide_Introduction) and
I would love to receive feedback before going ahead and changing the
content.
Tomorrow, I plan to put in the minor changes and I will decide what to
do for the others depending on your comments.

Marco

Hi Marco,
thank you for your comments. Yes you are a little bit in late, we have
to publish v2 tomorrow and we can't make a lot of changes the day
before ;).

Please could you take a look here:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing
Every articles come after a brainstorming with all the authors.

I suggest to freeze the guide and to discuss your comments for next version.
Is that ok for you?

Thanks,
Mat

Sure, it's fine for me.
What do you suggest to do? Wait until after the 10th, put in the
changes and then discuss them?
