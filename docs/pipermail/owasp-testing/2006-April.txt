Hi Robert,
there are many sections to be done as people that said they would
contribute are unable to do so.
At the minute I am compiling all the submitted documents into one
large document.
When that is done we shall have a list of outstanding topics. When
that is done (Maybe next week) we can chose what we want to write is
accordance to or strengths.

We need reviewers and writers for outstanding topics (Topics TBA).

Some people have offered their help in reviewing also and I have
compiled a list of "willing and able" reviewers.

Regarding topics/chapters that have been assigned to people last year
but have not been delivered those topics shall be also offered to new
potential writers.

Remember all material must be original, Google is good at discovering
plagiarism.

The TODO list shall be sent out next week, hopefully :0)

Hi,
The Guide is shaping up well, Its real hard work compiling dozens of
separate documents into one. People have also written about the same
topic a number of times which is difficult to edit. But for my sins I
shall proceed and hope to have a rough draft in the next couple of
weeks BUT....

Below are a list of topics to be written for the Guide.
Some of these are easy enough but nevertheless they need to be
documented, any offers appreciated :0)

HTTP:

Listening HTTP ports
HTTP banner and server version
HTTP server extensions
HTTP methods supported

Data Protection:
? Sensitive data in source [ ]
? Sensitive data in persistent cookies [ ]
? Privileges granted from the web server to data backends (CMS or
DBMS, many people use the admin users to connect both, i.e. 'sa' in
MsSQL)


Client certificates [ ]
Path traversal  ]

Input Injection
? SQL []
? OS [ ]
? LDAP [ ]
? XSS []
? Debug commands [ ]
? Null Bytes [ ]
? Unicode [ ]


Fuzzing:

Benefits of fuzzing applications and protocols
General guidelines when fuzzing
Fuzzing examples (this could be a step by step process detailing a
successful fuzz of a component)

Language/Services/Application Specific Testing:
Java/J2EE (including applet analysis) [ ]
JavaScript
ASP/.Net
Perl [ ]
PHP [ ]
J2EE []
C#/C/C++ [ ]
SAP [ ]
Database testing (via the web application) [ ]
Flash testing and applet analysis (an area which has had no research
done into it) []
Google hacking []

Validating results & Identifying false positives


If anyone would like to contribute to any of the above please drop me
a line specifying what they would like to do.

regards,

Eoin
