Hi,
as we speak the guide is being wiki-ized. All submissions so far
should be up on the wiki over the coming days.
This should make contribution or tweeking of the guide much easier.
The guide shall also be on the live CD for times when net access is
not possible.

I shall keep you posted.

hi,
The guide is now up on the wiki.
There is more to do but it looks like a good start.
please take a peel if you get the time and voice any suggestions.
It can also be seen what is lacking and what can be added to which
should help with any confusion regarding what sections people can
contribute to.

Hi Eoin

The threat modeling section still shows TO DO. Are there any volunteers for
this section who need some assistance or does it need to be written from
scratch?

regards
Varun

Hey folks,

we're planning on having an "autumn of code". Please think about how  
you might be able to use an intern or two and submit proposals to  
owasp-leaders.

thanks,
Andrew

nice to see some progress.

Can all the contributors who want to be noted in the contributors list
please tell me what part they did and ill add their names.
Going through all documentation would be painful so let your voice be heard

I'd also like to thank Aspect security and Jeff for all their help
with this one :)

Hi,
Can the author of this part of the guide please note that this section
has been moved to the countermeasure section:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_protect_sensitive_data_in_URL%27s
 it is more of a best practice rather than a testing tip or how-to
from a test standpoint

This is great work -- we'll be announcing next week.  This week we're
announcing that Fortify has donated their vulnerability library to OWASP.
There's a link on the homepage -- check it out.

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] PCI standard - Code review is coming!!
Message-ID: <f3193c100607311621t6c65b0e4qe21dedba173edec8@mail.gmail.com>

Code review may become a factor in PCI compliance.
This would give the *light* standard some real edge in my opinion.
