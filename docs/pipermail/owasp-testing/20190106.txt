Dear list,

I'm trying to use the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology, but running into some
issues. I'd be grateful if someone with expertise on the methodology could
help.

One of my primary sources of confusion is regarding the ?Skill level?
Threat Agent factor on the Likelihood side of the risk equation. This
probably isn't a surprise, since it seems there've been several discussions
on this list over the years about this section, along with at least 10
?warring? edits to the wiki page directly changing the order of the weights
associated with the threat agent skill levels.

So, my first question: What is the intended purpose of capturing the
attacker's skill level in relation to the likelihood of a threat event
occurring?

At first I assumed this was being captured to gauge ?attacker cost?, and as
such I (apparently like many before me) thought the current ratings were
backwards (if a threat can be accomplished by someone with little to no
skill, the attacker's cost is low, so likelihood higher). I've come to
understand though that attacker cost is not the objective here in capturing
the threat agent?s ?skill level?. However, I'm still confused as to what
the purpose is. What value is there in trying to guess the maximum level of
skill of a potential attacker? Especially since the directions instruct the
reader to ?Use the worst-case threat agent?, shouldn't the worst-case
threat agent always be someone with ?security penetration skills?, or is
this just a way to say an organization is only concerned about threat
agents with skills less than or equal to X?

My second point of confusion is also related to the threat agent.
Essentially, if we can agree that attacker skill is inversely proportional
to ?Size? (as attacker skill increases, the pool size decreases), it seems
that these two values effectively cancel each other out. For example, if we
imagine a threat where we're concerned about attackers with "security
penetration skills" (likely a pool size even smaller than "developers" or
"system administrators") - all other values being equal, we get:
Threat Agent Factors
Skill: 9 ("security penetration skills")
Motive: 9
Opportunity: 9
Size: 1 ("security penetration skills")

Vulnerability Factors
Ease of discovery: 9
Ease of exploit: 9
Awareness: 9
Intrusion Detection: 9

Likelihood Value: ((9+9+9+1) + (9+9+9+9))/8 = 8.0

Conversely, if we imagine a threat (same vulnerability) where we're only
concerned with attackers with "No technical skills", which includes the
pool of all anonymous internet users (all other values being equal), we get:
Threat Agent Factors
Skill: 1 ("No technical skills")
Motive: 9
Opportunity: 9
Size: 9 ("anonymous Internet users")

Vulnerability Factors
Ease of discovery: 9
Ease of exploit: 9
Awareness: 9
Intrusion Detection: 9

Likelihood Value: ((1+9+9+9) + (9+9+9+9))/8 = 8.0

Since we end up with the same likelihood value in either case, it seems
that the "Skill" threat agent factor is extraneous and simply adds
unnecessary complexity.

So, what am I missing? What is the intended purpose of the "skill" threat
agent factor? On the face of it, it seems like it adds unnecessary
complexity at best, and undue subjectivity and confusion.

I may be missing something, and I'm happy to be proven wrong. If not
though, may I suggest that the skill factor be removed from the OWASP Risk
Rating Methodology?

Thank you for lending your expertise.

Sincerely,

Jesse D'Aguanno
