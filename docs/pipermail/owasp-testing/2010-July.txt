Message-ID: <AANLkTikohW-HXa8FEeW7OZpUwXIXg0UP16N8UQr1kdIn@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a web server which requires client certificate to be installed
so that I can access this site. I want to do testing on this
condition. Any idea what steps I need to take on testing this web
application with that condition?

The server operating system is MS Windows Server 2003 and the web
server is IIS.
The message shown is:

"The page requires a client certificate"

Thanks!

Should I use the burpsuite pro?
So this burpsuite can bypass the client side certificate request from
the server?

When a client-side certificate mechanism is properly implemented burpsuite
cannot bypass it.
What sebastien ment was that burp supports clients-side certificates, but
you still need a valid certificate.
When you need to test the application ask your client for a valid
certificate.
When you need to test the complete security of the system, try to find ways
to bypass the mechanism by analysing the requests and responses and see if
there are loopholes.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Testing Guide v4: start-up
Message-ID: <AANLkTinf-LUvbdVljWchH3rMwOCXiP-6DMYf-_2NKw95@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
thanks to the OWASP Foundation, it's time to start-up with a new OWASP
Testing Guide project!

Introduction and Project purpose for v4:
============================
The OWASP Testing Guide v3 includes a "best practice" penetration
testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations
and a "low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques
for testing most common web application and web service security
issues. Nowadays the Testing Guide has become the standard to perform
a Web Application Penetration Testing and many Companies all around
the world have adopted it.
It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that
represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

Project Roadmap
=============
- 1st phase: Brainstorming
18th July 2010: starting a brainstorming with the OWASP Leaders and
project contributors to share goals and project's objectives.
The following are the main improvements we have to realize:
- Inserting new testing techniques, OWASP Top10 update: HTTP Verb
tampering, HTTP Parameter Pollutions, URL Redirection, Insecure Direct
Object References, Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Failure to Restrict
URL Access, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection, Unvalidated
Redirects and Forwards.
- Review and improve all the sections in v3,
- Create a more readable guide, eliminating some sections that are not
really useful, Rationalize some sections as Session Management
Testing,
- Create a new section: Client side security and Firefox extensions testing.
- Create a test case for each test to perform using O2 platform

- 2nd phase: Set-up the team
15th August: Introduce the new project to the OWASP mailing list
seeking for contributors. We need to involve also the final users of
the Testing Guide (for example Banking Companies to understand how
they would like to improve that).

- 3rd phase: Create a new Index
15th September: creating a new table of contents of the OTGv4
assigning a task for each contributor.
Here is the v3 Index:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents

- 4th phase:  Writing and reviewing
1st October 2010: Starting writing
1st November 2010:Starting the first review phase,
15th November 2010: Starting writing articles II phase,
1st December 2010: Starting the second review phase,
15th December 2010: Create the RC1,
15th January 2011: Release the version 4.

1st phase
=======
Now, we are at the 1st phase, and I think this phase it's the most
important to create a solid project as we saw from the last versions.
This time I found really important to open a debate about the following item.

- OWASP vulnerabilities -
The OWASP Testing Guide checklist represents the set of controls to
test: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist
We divided it into 10 categories (Information Gath, Config. Mng,
Authentication, etc...). For each category we tell what test to
perfom.
The last column tells you what vulnerability you can find if the test
demonstrate a weakness of the application.
Now I see that the list of vulnerabilities is not alligned with all
the OWASP Guides.
Imo the point is that is foundamental to create a list of OWASP
Vulnerabilities shared between the OWASP projects. Why?
Because the OWASP DevGuide, Code Review and Testing Guide should be
linked to this common KB: in this way the 3 projects are linked
between the others and Companies can uderstand for each vuln how to
protect from this vuln (Dev), how to review that code (CR), and how to
test the app running (TG). Then because it is very important for the
Companies have a full list of the possible WebAppSec vulns (I think
there is a lack now).

At this time we have: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability
But this list does not represents what I mean.
I would like to start from the OWASP Testing Guide checklist and
collect all the vulnerabiities we can find from the last column, add
the new ones. Then maybe Eoin's team should add the white box
vulnerabilities: we know some are the same of the black box
assessment, but others can be found only perfoming a Code Review, for
example "Backdoor in the code". Then the Dev Guide team should point
to this set of vulnerabilities telling how to write code to protect
the application for each vulnerability.

What do you think about that?

Thanks,
Mat

Lets not forget that for v4 we should fully align Common OWASP Numbering :
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering

It seems like the "Testing Checklist" might be the best/easiest place to do this first, then bring the Index inline etc.

Hi all,
that is something that has always been on my mind.
Converging guides and methodology is the way to go but may incur overhead on
future releases.
I'd like to do this with the code review guide also.

Yah agreed, we need to get the houses in order now as otherwise we
risk being a mix of different approaches.

"- Create a test case for each test to perform using O2 platform"

I think this could be a massive project on its own, whilst I love the
O2 platform as much as Dinis, I'm wondering why the need to have a
test case for each approach?

I love the idea of test cases, but not thrilled to have them tied to any one platform.  Could they be defined in a tool independent manner such as pseudo code?  E.g.:

1. Send response XYZ
2. If response contains "blah"
2.1 Test fails
3. If response does not contain "blah"
3.1 Test passes

etc.

But then we are opening ourselves up for crap from suggesting one tool
over the other.

something like that is already attempted in the CAPEC.
http://capec.mitre.org/data/graphs/1000.html

I think it is a shame that hardly any updates on that project has been done
the last year(s) because I very much like the approach.

Maybe it's an idea to revive that project and combine it with the testing
guide ?

I'll volunteer to update the figures (graphics) that are currently in use, something I already done for parts of the v3 material when doing a local print-run. For those who are adding screenshots please upload them at highest possible resolution and let the wiki size them down to screen-size. Some screenshots are horrible at the moment, especially at print size, but haven't got around to fix those yet.

And while I am on the thread, are anyone of you guys gonna turn up at Blackhat/Defcon? I know that I am.

Best regards
Michael Boman

Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Testing Guide v4: start-up

Hi all,
thanks to the OWASP Foundation, it's time to start-up with a new OWASP
Testing Guide project!

Introduction and Project purpose for v4:
============================
The OWASP Testing Guide v3 includes a "best practice" penetration
testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations
and a "low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques
for testing most common web application and web service security
issues. Nowadays the Testing Guide has become the standard to perform
a Web Application Penetration Testing and many Companies all around
the world have adopted it.
It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that
represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

Project Roadmap
=============
- 1st phase: Brainstorming
18th July 2010: starting a brainstorming with the OWASP Leaders and
project contributors to share goals and project's objectives.
The following are the main improvements we have to realize:
- Inserting new testing techniques, OWASP Top10 update: HTTP Verb
tampering, HTTP Parameter Pollutions, URL Redirection, Insecure Direct
Object References, Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Failure to Restrict
URL Access, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection, Unvalidated
Redirects and Forwards.
- Review and improve all the sections in v3,
- Create a more readable guide, eliminating some sections that are not
really useful, Rationalize some sections as Session Management
Testing,
- Create a new section: Client side security and Firefox extensions testing.
- Create a test case for each test to perform using O2 platform

- 2nd phase: Set-up the team
15th August: Introduce the new project to the OWASP mailing list
seeking for contributors. We need to involve also the final users of
the Testing Guide (for example Banking Companies to understand how
they would like to improve that).

- 3rd phase: Create a new Index
15th September: creating a new table of contents of the OTGv4
assigning a task for each contributor.
Here is the v3 Index:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents

- 4th phase:  Writing and reviewing
1st October 2010: Starting writing
1st November 2010:Starting the first review phase,
15th November 2010: Starting writing articles II phase,
1st December 2010: Starting the second review phase,
15th December 2010: Create the RC1,
15th January 2011: Release the version 4.

1st phase
=======
Now, we are at the 1st phase, and I think this phase it's the most
important to create a solid project as we saw from the last versions.
This time I found really important to open a debate about the following item.

- OWASP vulnerabilities -
The OWASP Testing Guide checklist represents the set of controls to
test: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist
We divided it into 10 categories (Information Gath, Config. Mng,
Authentication, etc...). For each category we tell what test to
perfom.
The last column tells you what vulnerability you can find if the test
demonstrate a weakness of the application.
Now I see that the list of vulnerabilities is not alligned with all
the OWASP Guides.
Imo the point is that is foundamental to create a list of OWASP
Vulnerabilities shared between the OWASP projects. Why?
Because the OWASP DevGuide, Code Review and Testing Guide should be
linked to this common KB: in this way the 3 projects are linked
between the others and Companies can uderstand for each vuln how to
protect from this vuln (Dev), how to review that code (CR), and how to
test the app running (TG). Then because it is very important for the
Companies have a full list of the possible WebAppSec vulns (I think
there is a lack now).

At this time we have: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability
But this list does not represents what I mean.
I would like to start from the OWASP Testing Guide checklist and
collect all the vulnerabiities we can find from the last column, add
the new ones. Then maybe Eoin's team should add the white box
vulnerabilities: we know some are the same of the black box
assessment, but others can be found only perfoming a Code Review, for
example "Backdoor in the code". Then the Dev Guide team should point
to this set of vulnerabilities telling how to write code to protect
the application for each vulnerability.

What do you think about that?

Thanks,
Mat

If v4 fully adopts Common OWASP Numbering, won't all the guides be aligned? (Unless we purposefully or accidentally leave an item out...)

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering

If all OWASP projects use the same numbering scheme then it should be pretty difficult for any project to miss something.

Hi all,
that is something that has always been on my mind.
Converging guides and methodology is the way to go but may incur overhead on future releases.
I'd like to do this with the code review guide also.

All guides need to compliant each other, cover off the same issues, one
might say?
Common numbering is fine but we need to cross reference development and
review guides.
O2 is a static analysis tool so why the testing guide? The user guide for
that tool needs to be developed stand alone which can then also referenced.

I totally agree that all guides need to be compliant with each other. I kind of see Common Numbering as a way to accomplish this.
For example in the Dev guide I assume there's a section (or sections) that deal with strong input validation, via common numbering those sections should reference Testing topics such as SQL Injection, HPP, Buffer Overflow, etc. Similarly via common numbering those same sections in the Testing guide should reference whichever relevant section(s) of the Dev guide (strong input validation).

As I'm saying this I'm also looking at the ASVS content, which common numbering was supposed to be based on, and it seems to have changed since the common numbering idea was put forth. Is common numbering an impossible goal since all guides/projects move at a different pace and are acted upon by different groups? Should Common Numbering be established and set in stone for particular versions of the guides? i.e.: TGv3, ASVSv2009 [couldn't find current version info, docs seem to be tagged 2009], Code Review Guide v1.1, Dev Guide 2.0.1 or actually the upcoming versions should all use v1 of the Common Numbering scheme? Then if new things need to be added to subsequent versions of the guides/projects the common numbering scheme should be incremented and enhanced with new categories/items as well (prior to work on the other guides/project)...

As for O2, I agree that a separate reference or user guide could/should be developed and referenced as needed. At the same time as things currently are the TG provides testing examples using various tools (of the author's choice, at the time of writing), there is no reason that anyone should be prevented from using O2 as part of their example(s). Authors are telling people that they "must" use tool XYZ to test item ABC, it's only an example/suggestion.

So we have
1) Common Numbering
2) ASVS
3) O2 examples

I'm all for those.

What I'd like to see in addition to the above is some sort of actual
methodology instead of mappings of activities (ASVS) to tools (O2) and
compatibility to other guides (Common Numbering).

In TAOSSA, there are code auditing strategies, and I know what you're
all thinking "yeah that's code review, you stupid Andre punk", but no,
no they are not just code review techniques -- the authors talk about
black-box and threat-modeling approaches in these strategies as well.

It would also be interesting to talk about where worlds meet here,
such as how to map URLs to source code depending on the target app
platform. Which brings me to another issue: app routing and URL
rewriting i.e. where a target website location contains more than one
web application, perhaps on different varieties of web servers with
different technologies in place.

Cheers,
Andre

I can copy the cookies to another browser/computer so that he/she can

How do I fix this vulnerability?

A few ways:

1. Embed some specific information such as REMOTE_ADDRESS into the cookie.

2. It is unclear whether the cookie stores username/password. If it does, DON'T.

3. Give the cookie a shorter time out.

Well, these don't complete solve the problem. But they will help limit the possibilities.

Besides, if one can obtain a cookie, he pretty much can do anything else. That's how CSS and CSRF works, isn't it? In your case, this requires access to that particular machine (to __copy the cookies__). You have a bigger problem to worry about then.

I'm not so keen on adding remote address, not always the best approach.

My approach would be:

1: ensure simultaneous logins are not enabled by default
2: ensure the session timeout is low (15-20 minutes) as Nam mentioned
3: The HttpOnly flag should be set on the cookie

Again, what Nam mentioned about any sensitive information being in the cookie

I wouldn't really call this a vulnerability, it's how 99% of the web applications on the internet work.  After login, the session ID is stored in a cookie which is then used as the only authentication token from that point onwards.  Security controls are usually then built around preventing access to the cookie, so make sure the app doesn't have XSS vulnerabilities, the cookie is transferred only over HTTPS and has the httponly and "secure" flags set.

Assuming you are talking about some sort of session token in the cookie that
can be reused on another client some other relevant tips from
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management
 All session tokens in high value applications SHOULD be tied to a specific
HTTP client instance (session identifier and IP address).
Application servers SHOULD use private temporary file areas per
client/application to store session data.
All applications SHOULD use a cryptographically secure page or form nonce in
a hidden form field.
Each form or page nonce SHOULD be removed from the active list as soon as it
is submitted.
 Session tokens should be regenerated prior to any significant high value
transaction.
In high-value applications, session tokens should be regenerated after a
certain number of requests.
In high-value applications, session tokens should be regenerated after a
certain period of time.

In general you can say the less predictable a session token is, the more
secure it is.
So to make your appplication as secure as possible:
- make it difficult to predict
- link it to the client with an difficult to predict property
- reuse each token as little as possible and regenerate as often as possible
- make use of a second (unpredictable) token and validate and reissue that
for every request (also helps against CSRF)

And 95% of the application accept and use user input unvalidated ... Is that
not a vulnerability either then ?

Session hijacking IS a vulnerability. You can prevent it and it should be
prevented.
The problem is that many apps where you can abuse this probabely have more
easy to exploit vulnerabilities to why bother exploiting it.

Using REMOTE_IP is right but is not a complete solution because it could be a 
proxy IP used by an entire company to "surf" internet or
if is the PC it's easy to forge for an attacker.

You should use a short session, and the remote_ip too. The timeout/session time 
of the cookie is an attack window :o(

Hey Dave, you're providing great guidance, but do you have a place we can
point developers to get UnitTests to check for the correct implementation of
these? (these unit tests should test from the browser point of view and the
correct source-code implementation).

The developers would customize these UnitTests to their app, but don't you
think that we need to show them working examples of these recomendations?

I didn't claim the contrary.  The original poster described taking a session cookie (not mentioning where he got it) and then using it in another browser to get access to another user's session.  This is like saying every app on the internet is vulnerable to authentication hijacking, because if I take your username and your password then I can login as you!  

What I was saying was that the controls around the session ID are focussed on preventing attackers from getting hold of the session ID in the first place.  Very few "high value" apps will need to defend against attacks where the attacker has already got hold of the session ID.

The advice you posted is nice and complete, I agree 100% - and I like that you qualified some of the controls with: "...for high value applications...", which shows that for other apps some of those controls are overkill.

You mean other than the OWASP testing guide (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Session_Management) ? The only
place I can think of is the CAPEC (
http://capec.mitre.org/data/graphs/1000.html)<http://capec.mitre.org/data/graphs/1000.html>.
Although the site has not been updated frequently the last year(s) it still
contains a lot of useful information.

 When I do a security audit I test the following things in session
management:
- general mechanism of session management (renewal after log in, lifespan in
application, etc)
- time-out and log off mechanism
- protection of session tokens (tokens in URL, cookie protection, etc)
- logging of session tokens
- session hijacking possibilities
- predictability of session tokens (obvious weak encoding / encryption,
fixed values, etc)

I'm afraid that I'd be more inclined to agree with Stephen - controls in the
app should be built around protecting the session ID (e.g. general input
validation, httponly and secure flags on the cookie, re-issuing the token
and invalidating the old one when moving from HTTP to HTTPS, moving from
unauthenticated to authenticated and again when logging out, stopping
concurrent logins, etc, etc, blah, blah, and all the stuff you suggested!).

If someone could just get access to the token locally and copy and paste it
to another browser then you have bigger problems. When testing apps, I've
never been convinced that the old 'copy and paste the session token from one
machine to another' test provides any great benefit. I suppose it's always
helpful to try and think of a practical way that someone can just get access
to the token like this and if you can't, then that risk that an attacker is
going to be able to get the token like this is pretty low.
Tying the session ID to a particular location/IP is difficult as suggested.
Although I'm all for the cheesy 'security in depth' approach, it depends on
the purpose of the application and the type of data it is processing - the
solution should be fit for the purpose of the application. I.e. a variation
of all of the above is great if you're protecting a high-value application,
but who really cares about implementing all of this for a brocureware site
that sells lawn-mowers!

I have to disagree :) During authentication the application is basically
determining the trust of the user trying to log in. Usually a username and
password is al that is needed, but stronger mechanisms exist. After
authentication most users do not like to provide these credentials again for
each and every request so some sort of token is issued. This token is
therefor basically a trust token. In order for this trust to be legitimate
the application should have a mechanism to validate the authenticity of this
token. Just accepting any token that happens to be an active token is like
only asking for a username (and no password) and assuming everybody will
only use his/her username.

Oh, I agree on that one. For most applications it is sufficient to use an
unpredictable token, protect it and limiting the lifespan.
Nonetheless session hijacking remains a vulnerability but with an acceptable
residual risk.

The advice you posted is nice and complete, I agree 100% - and I like that
you qualified some of the controls with: "...for high value
applications...", which shows that for other apps some of those controls are
overkill.

Well, it is just a copy/paste from the Testing Guide, so I can't take the
credits for it :)

Per request tokens is one way, but that may break the UI.

...IF and only IF we assume that every session token is a 128 bit random
value which is not always the case ...

But the predictability of the session token is not really the issue here.
The fundamental issue is that for authentication usually you need at least
two things: a username and a password. Not taking into consideration user
stupidity these are difficult to obtain. In session management you
essentially strip this down to only 1 thing; the token. When you obtain the
token no additional information is needed to gain access if the authenticity
of the token is not validated. Therefore I think it is a good practice to
compensate this by implementing a session management variation on two-factor
authentication being validating the session id against some client-side
unique value.

But you're right this discussion is becoming very academic and fundamental
and for 99% of the applications there are more serious things to worry about
:)

This is not the same. Cookies can be linked with unique secret tokens stored
in POST hidden fields (that are unique per every browser) and its IP address, 
therefore just copying of the cookie to the different browsers won't work
at all.

There are some clients that sit behind a multi-IP proxy where each request originates from a different IP address.  AOL used to employ such a system.  Those clients, if they're important, must have an alternate system available that doesn't rely on the IP address (or allows more than one).

If the nonce is rotated for each request, know that it will break the browser history (e.g. back button).  The impact to the user can be minimized by requiring they re-authenticate, then automatically perform the original request.

Bill,

Like I said earlier that was just a copy/paste from the Testing Guide as
sample examples for minimizing the risk of session hijacking. As with every
problem and solution you should always find a balance between security,
functionality, usability and performance.

Hi,
thanks for the answers.

I've updated the Project roadmap collecting all our ideas:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Testing_Project/Releases/Testing_Guide_V_4.0/Roadmap

1) Review all the control numbers to adhere to the OWASP Common numbering.

The Testing Guide have to allign to the OWASP CN but I would like to
discuss the problem that the list nowadays is derived by the set of
OTG controls.
I'd like to update it based on all the possible vulnerabilities an
application can suffer.
So my idea is to update the OWASP list of vulnerabilities first, then
update OWAP CN, and finally we can build the new index for the OWASP
TG.

2) The idea of the 02 test cases for the black box testing

The test cases are only for the set of controls described from the
testing guide, O2 is not only a Source Code Analizer tool.
I agree to Michael thoughts:
>The idea of creating O2 examples for each item should be an addendum project led by the O2 team. (And that would be an awesome set of docs
>too, I just wouldn't want it to slow down the overall creation of the testing guide)

We are a community, so we have to understand what the community wants
for improving our projects. The idea of Dinis to create the test cases
for each OTG controls is challenging and interesting (we should add a
paragraph at the end of each test description). What if we can
demonstrate what O2 can do just for 1 test, so we can decide if that
is appropriate or not?

3) Allignment with ASVS

Yes this was in my mind talking with Mike months ago. This will be
another challenging task of the project.

Thanks,
Mat

Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Application Security Event - September 2010
Message-ID: <AANLkTin=kP43d6BFin0Sz4rspkkgtKrJ0SpHmsjTO9Q1@mail.gmail.com>

*Re: OWASP Ireland September 17th 2010*

Hello,
The agenda has been finalised for the OWASP Ireland event. We have the
pleasure to announce a number of key figures from industry which should
provide some unique insight into the latest trends, threats and
methodologies in the world of application security.
*http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010*<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010>

*Keynotes*:

*John Viega: ?Application Security in the Real World? - Considerations for
AppSec in non-security companies.*

John is Executive Vice President of Products and Engineering at Perimeter
E-Security. John has authored numerous books on security, including the
recent ?Myths of Security?, and the seminal ?Building Secure Software?,
which was the first book on application security.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/John_Viega

*Professor Fred Piper "The changing face of cryptography" *

Fred Piper was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of
London in 1975 and has worked in information security since 1979. In 1985,
he formed a company, Codes & Ciphers Ltd, which offers consultancy advice in
all aspects of information security. He has acted as a consultant to over 80
companies including a number of financial institutions and major industrial
companies in the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, South Africa and the USA. The
consultancy work has been varied and has included algorithm design and
analysis, work on EFTPOS and ATM networks, data systems, security audits,
risk analysis and the formulation of security policies. He has lectured
worldwide on information security, both academically and commercially, has
published more than 100 papers and is joint author of Cipher Systems (1982),
one of the first books to be published on the subject of protection of
communications, Secure Speech Communications (1985), Digital Signatures -
Security & Controls (1999) and Cryptography: A Very Short Introduction
(2002).

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Professor_Fred_Piper

* *

*Damian Gordon Phd: ?Hackers and Hollywood: The Implications of the Popular
Media Representation of Computer Hacking"*

Damian Gordon is a lecturer with the School of Computing at the Dublin
Institute of Technology and is Programme Co-ordinator for the School's
Masters in Computing (Assistive Technology). He was primary researcher on
two EU funded projects whose particular focus was looking at issues
associated with technoacceptance - the ILT and the E4 projects - and was
Educational Advisor for the Ireland-China EMERSION project. His research
interests include Differentiated Instruction, Computer Security,
Technostress, ICT and Special Needs, Virtual Learning Environments, Image
reconstruction from specular reflections, and Lateral Thinking Techniques.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Damian_Gordon
*We also have some great international and local speakers covering topics
from Smart phone application security to SDLC to Penetration testing
techniques:*

?         Dan Cornell ("Smart Phones with Dumb Apps")

?         Ryan Berg ("Path to a Secure Application")

?         Dr Marian Ventunaec ("Testing the Enterprise E-mail Security -
from Software to Cloud-based Services")

?         Fred Donovan and (?Counter Intelligence as Defense???)

?         Nick Coblentz (?Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle???) but
to name a few



http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010#Agenda_and_Presentations_-_September_17



*Training*:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010#Training

Secure application development training shall also be held on the 16th (day
prior to the event):

*?Secure Application Development: Writing secure code (and testing it)?*

Testing shall be delivered by Eoin Keary, OWASP board member and ?The OWASP
Code Review Guide? (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project) Lead &
Rahm Jina, Senior consultant with Ernst & Young.

This intensive one-day course focuses on the most common web application
security problems, including aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten (2010) and
the MITRE Top 25.  The course will introduce and demonstrate application
assessment techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be
exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such
vulnerabilities in their code, covering of the following areas:

Unvalidated Input

Injection Flaws

Cross-Site Scriping

CSRF

Authentication & Session Management

Access control & Authorisation

Broken Caching

Error Handling

Cryptography

Resource Management

Rich Internet Applications & Webservices

The Secure SDLC

There are other ways than the IP address which you can use to track a
specific client instance.
I recently read a paper which used many things like installed fonts in the
browser, available browser plugins, browser language, java vm version, and
many more to build a huge browser identifier.
According to the paper, it was possible to distinguish browser even when
using NoScript, cleaning headers or by using Tor.

I'm not sure whether there already exists an implementation which you can
use, but it can give you usable ideas:

Hello Matteo

My company uses the Testing Guide(!), but also maintains a list of
extra tests or comments against some of the v3 sections.  Is it useful
to write this up, or should we be editing the v3 wiki, or should we
wait until v4 is underway?

Regards

Colin

Hi Colin,
great to have your feedback! Please share with us your suggestions, it
is the perfect time to discuss it and add it to the new index of the
v4.

Thanks,
Mat
