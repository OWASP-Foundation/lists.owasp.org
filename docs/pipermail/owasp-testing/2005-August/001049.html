<PRE>Mauro, good job. Here are some quick comments. 
 
SSL
 
Shameless plug for SSL 
<A HREF="http://www.foundstone.com/resources/proddesc/ssldigger.htm">http://www.foundstone.com/resources/proddesc/ssldigger.htm</A>
Designed to exactly what you describe (and more)
Key lengths are tied to cipher suites
You need to also comment on key exchange protocols (strong cipher with
ADH is not a good idea !)
 
Certs
 
You should not use a regular browser to check certificates. Many of the
API's used by the .NET framework do not adequately check CRL's and CRL
paths. You have to hand the full bang of certs you have etc. Look at API
doc for example. Many browser settings will determine how the relevant
API is invoked. This means certs can be invalid but still report as
being valid in some cases dependent on browser config. They also use the
local clock to determine date time matching so if your local clock is
not accurate (i.e. set forward by 3 months) you will not get a true
indication of the cert has expired. There are also fields you need to
look for including usage (I often see key signing certs on SSL servers).
You should also explicitly ensure people don't think certs are web
server certs. JSSE, MSCAPI etc all have classes where SSL is
instantiated from the app itself. This is especially important in web
services where you are not relying on infrastructure to provide the
security. 
 
PS for shits and giggles <A HREF="https://www.verisign.net">https://www.verisign.net</A>
 
Backup files - pet hate. Who cares if there is a sample file installed
UNLESS it has a vulnerability. Needs to be made clear to stop the scare
mongerers ;-) Also I think its important to explain the 404 issues and
why Nikto and tools like it usually report so many false positives. 
 
WebDav section needs work but sadly no time to comment now.
