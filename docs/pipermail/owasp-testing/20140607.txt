You haven't dispute the evidence that I have put forth?

No, no and no.

Dinis Cruz, as an OWASP Board Member, should *not* be allowed to
manage or lead his own OWASP Projects.  Neither should he be allowed
to direct "charity" funds to the development of a commercial product
owned by Security Innovation.

Reread http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2011-January/009563.html
that supports the above.

Furthermore, OWASP should not hire the wife of Dinis Cruz's personal
friend, Paulo Coimbra i.e.
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-January/004493.html
to assist with Security Innvotations commercial exploitation of OWASP
when http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/05/sarah-baso-as-owasp-executive-director.html
has considerably more experience with OWASP.

... and who could forget Jeff Williams own opinion of Security
Innovation i.e.
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-August/006011.html

Sonatype was founded by former employees of 02 and Josh Corman worked
for Rugged Software.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Rugged_Software <- WTF is this doing
on the OWASP Wiki? 0WASP "02 With Aspect Security Promotion"  :-)

BTW No one expect for Dinis Cruz has any idea what 02 does and Dinis
doesn't help it when he references other well known projects, such as
HacmeBank.  Mark Curphey refers to this as [Dinis Cruz] "lost in 02
world".

I don't have an issue with Simon but the fact is Michael Coates, him
and you have all worked for Mozilla and yet OWASP invested in WebScrab
in the past.  In Simon's defence he probably didn't know about
WebScrab because OWASP didn't help with the promotion of known
projects since hired Dinis Cruz hired personal friends to promote his
own projects.

Yeah, so in essence what Jim is now doing is what Dinis Cruz should
have completed three years ago but didn't.

The OWASP Testing Guide is a documentation project and as far as I am
aware is out of being demoted now?

<- Yeah, Dinis Cruz just wants to see the world burn.

BTW I don't see how your reply is relevant to the OWASP Testing Guide.

If *you* are aware of ongoing corruption, then *you* collect the evidence,
and put forward a proposal for a review.  I am not going to.  I have a
career, run a separate non-profit, contribute to owasp, organize several
local groups, and have a family; I don't (and most of the other OWASP
leaders probably don't) have time to investigate it for you.  I am happy
with the direction that OWASP is going, and support the direction that the
current board is moving in.  I am not going to do your work for you.

Wait what? The people who are most invested in the success of their
projects that are contributed to OWASP shouldn't be allowed take on a
position of greater responsibility to ensure the success of the community
in addition to their own project?  I don't know if you have leadership or
management experience, but in general, you want to promote and/or recruit
people that show initiative.

I tend to agree (where "Security Innovation" is replaced with "a for-profit
business").  So, take the initiative, collect the evidence, and build a
case.

So this is a stream of consciousness style write-up that doesn't really
make clear sense to me without reading the supporting docs.

Yeah, you might want to educate yourself on the history of ZAP before you
put your foot in your mouth.  Simon implemented ZAP before he was involved
with OWASP, and made a strong positive contribution to OWASP out of the
gate.

I don't know why you want to drag my employer into this; all three of the
people named were OWASP contributors before joining Mozilla, and actually
ramped up their involvement after joining Mozilla.

Sorry to break it to you, but no amount of promotion would have saved
WebScarab.  It was a powerful and flexible tool, but it had a painful UI, a
terrible learning curve.  ZAP is successful because it was a natural
progression of an effectively abandoned (but still popular) tool, a
generous helping of new features, and alot of UI love.

Again, what?  You are complaining that a current board member is doing
something you felt was long needed?  I am not sure what your point is.
Dinis isn't on the board.  Focusing your aggression and frustration on a
single (or a small group) of individuals really detracts from any
significant point you are trying to make.  I have yet to see a single
constructive point come out of anything you have said in this thread.  That
deficiency, by the way, coupled with your accusations and tone are the main
reasons I felt the need to respond.  You aren't contributing in a
constructive fashion, you are actively undermining folks (Jim, Johanna)
that are, and you are wasting peoples ime.

If so, it is my opinion that it is a mistake; once the clearly defined
criteria for being a flagship project are available, the projects should be
made to apply, with no grandfathering.  This forces projects to meet a
quality assurance guideline that means something.

I reference the testing guide a fair bit.  I have designed several training
courses that reference them; I am interested in seeing the Guide remain a
flagship project, but not at the expense of seeing a process implemented
that says the 'Flagship' stamp actually means something.

You are correct.  Pushing to the leaders list since this makes more sense
there.  I don't care much about the issues you have with past board
members, unless you are going to position them in way that focuses on being
constructive (learning from mistakes made in the past is constructive,
dwelling on them isn't).

Cheers,
Yvan

Thanks for bringing this discussion to the leaders list.  I can certainly
see how someone, especially those running projects, would see this Flagship
status demotion as a hassle at best and perhaps even "catastrophic" as
Christian put it.  I was, admittedly, a bit skeptical of the value of such
an action when the idea was first brought to me, but upon further
consideration, I changed my mind.  People around the world have come to
respect the OWASP name as a trusted source for tools and documentation, but
when they come to our website, their experience can vary based on where
they land.  Think about how you'd feel if you downloaded an OWASP
"Flagship" document with outdated information or a "Flagship" tool that
actually created security vulnerabilities when you used it.  It becomes a
situation where the proverbial one rotten apple can spoil the entire
bunch.  Sure, you could make the argument that we could evaluate each
current Flagship project and then demote on a case-by-case basis, and you'd
probably be right, but as hard as the evaluator would try to be objective,
in the end someone is probably going to get upset and cry foul.  With this
action, we have leveled the playing field (so to speak) and the projects
that advance back to Flagship can do so under the full support of the
community.

I don't think that it's in anybody's best interest to be in this limbo
state for long and in the interests of expediting the process, I just threw
out some ideas on what "Flagship" means to me here:

http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2014-June/011888.html

These are just suggestions, nothing set in stone, and I'm hoping that you
guys will follow up with your feedback and perhaps even your own
suggestions.  In a nutshell, how do we define a process that ensures that
when a person goes to OWASP and downloads a Flagship document, we know,
without hesitation, that it will be a high quality product that they can
rely on?  I'd say let's take the next week or so to solicit feedback from
the community, and then maybe you guys would be interested in helping to
assemble the pieces that make up the final process?  Johanna is already
working on putting the pieces in place for the code projects and I'm happy
to try to get the ball rolling on the documentation projects as well.  All
things considered, I bet we can have a process in place in the next 2-4
weeks.

On the contrary, I was very aware of WebScarab and its importance to OWASP
at the time - I half expected my application for ZAP to become an OWASP
project to be rejected due to the clear overlap with WebScarab.
I wanted to create a powerful but easy to use security tool for developers,
and I seriously considered using WebScarab as the basis for that tool.
However while WebScarab had much more of the functionality that I wanted
than Paros did, I found WebScarab very complicated and unintuitive.
I decided that I would rather add functionality to Paros than try to make
WebScarab easier to use, and I've not regretted that decision :)

I do agree that OWASP has not been very effective at promoting any of its
projects, including ZAP.
However I'm not going to point fingers at any individuals.
OWASP is primarily a volunteer organization, and its up to all of us to
address issues that we are concerned with.
While I think OWASP could do a better job of promoting all of its projects
I dont have any big ideas how that could be achieved - marketing is not my
area of expertise ;)
I dont like criticizing unless I can offer constructive alternatives.

Cheers,

Simon

Hello Everyone,

I've been watching this mail thread evolve in a mixture of shock and
disappointment. I've have been the leader of a volunteer security group in
Dublin, I've been attacked, I've been publicly questioned, I've been
insulted. As the leader my hands were tied, as I was supposed to raise
myself above the natural human reaction I wanted to have. In times like
this it was great when the community itself would *jump in* and define what
it would tolerate from it's members, both at a project level but also at
the human level of how we engage and communicate with each other.

In this group - I am not on the board. I am one of the voices, freed from
the constraints of political correctness and being the "better man".

I have witnessed highly insulting name calling with the *turncoat*
statement, potentially professionally damaging statements about disgruntled
employee behavior, organisational corruption insinuated with the nepotism
theory's [without reference to the skill sets of those hired] even leaning
towards accusing someone of embezzlement of funds.

The tone, the attitude and sentiment of these communications need to stop.
The corruption "facts" need to be elevated out of this arena, and into a
far more formalized process. Public slander should not be tolerated at any
level, least of all between the OWASP community itself. Jokes and Jibes are
part an parcel of any group. I do not see the humor in this thread. Just
ego.

We are a very small community - I've met Simon, twice. I saw Dinis once at
an OWASP gig in Dublin maybe 4 years ago. I looked at O2 as a potential
project to bring into my day job to help with automation, but at the time I
found it a bit prototypy for a rollout. I have not looked at it since. It
could be great now, It could be worse.

I am stating this so you can understand I am not friends, or married to
cousins of key stake holders or go for walks with OWASP board members dogs.
My opinions are my own. My linked in profile is at least 4 years out of
date, I don't do face book - so apologies to the background checkers. The
hostile nature of this communication thread needs to end. I'll go even one
step further - and explain myself in World cup terms.

In my opinion - someone has just been tackled in the box and the striker
has gone down. The referee has to make the decision. Was there a foul
committed or did the striker take a dive? One thing is certain, at this
point it's not O.K to wave play on.

Compile your evidence of corruption. Send it discreetly to the board. Let
the powers that be evaluate it.  If the allegations are determined to be
unjustified - its either a red card offence or a yellow, the referee can
decide. Or there is a penalty due that will change the course of the game.

Arguably if this matter had of been handled more discreetly I do not think
a yellow/red card would be justified irrespective of the result. At this
point I am not so sure. People should question and protest, it's how they
question - the medium they choose, and their approach that is subject to
review.

I also do not believe any project status should be above review. I think
downgrading everything - and then upgrading was potentially the fairest and
cleanest approach. Surely that technique is symbolic that the OWASP board
are not playing favorites.
I will not get involved in any further communication on this thread. I will
not reply to any response to this note. This is a toxic hostile thread that
needs to stop in it's current format. Compile the evidence, put it forward
and OWASP should clean house to suit the desired result of the inquiry.

Jason

Josh,

It appears that OWASP Board may create "new" measures of quality.  Why
doesn't the OWASP Board inform us of what has changed and then provide
a grace period of us to meet these new requirements?

Why doesn't OWASP get rid of the various project statuses altogether?
To me this would get rid of the specific OWASP Project Leaders being
accused of favouritism e.g.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2011-January/009563.html.
Also, webappsec.org does not have these for their projects.

Does the OWASP Board intend to direct funding for support staff, etc
to retain the quality of flagship projects e.g.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2008-September/006854.html.
Can I also request that these staff hired to not have a relationship
with the OWASP Board Members, rather they are independent and the
example is hiring Sandra who was the wife of Paulo.

Can the OWASP Board Members who are also OWASP Project Leaders be
required to remove themselves from OWASP Project leadership for the
duration of the term of the OWASP Board?  This is a side issue but it
is clear within
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2010-July/008733.html
that both Dinis, his personal friend Paulo, and Jeff Williams
conspired to remove suitable candidates from the ASVS Leadership
selection for their own gain and coincidently contributed nothing to
ASVS once they had awarded themselves leadership of this OWASP
Project.

Simon,

No offence but I have to correct your record.

You promoted ZAP to OWASP as a web proxy intended for developers and
not webappsec professionals and your subsequent development has
focused on features for the webappsec end user.  For comparison
purposes http://www.charlesproxy.com/ development has continued to
focus on web application developers.

I would assume that Paros had no end users and that its developer(s)
either didn't respond or refused to accept your patches (I am not sure
of the exact background) because they no longer wanted to maintain
Paros.  Furthermore, a majority of WebScarab end users where
transiting http://portswigger.net/burp/ which has a modest fee to
support its development.

Paros has the worst UI have ever seen and ZAP has not improved on the
UI after I tried it based on the recommendation of "The Testicles"
i.e. https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=sergicles%20ZAP&src=typd

Your promotion of ZAP on mailing lists not hosted by OWASP appears to
the public that WebScarab that it is no longer being developed and is
therefore devalued.

Both you and Michael (OWASP Chair) work[ed] at Mozilla and this is a
conflict of interest.  Also, Paul Theriaut (Mozilla) wanted to present
ZAP during the very unsuccessful relaunch of the OWASP Sydney,
