Introduction and Project purpose for v4:
============================ =============
The OWASP Testing Guide v3 includes a "best practice" penetration
testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations
and a "low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques
for testing most common web application and web service security
issues. Nowadays the Testing Guide has become the standard to perform
a Web Application Penetration Testing and many Companies all around
the world have adopted it.
It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that
represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

Project Roadmap
=============

- (1) 1st phase: Brainstorming and create a new table of contents

Objective: creating a new table of contents of the OTGv4
assigning a task for each contributor.
I created a new OWASP Testing Guide v4 table of Contents here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

- (2) 2nd phase:  Writing
20th September 2012: Start writing the articles
1st November 2012: 1st Draft
30th November: end of writing phase

- (3) 3rd phase: Reviewing

- 1st December 2012: Starting the review phase,
- 15th December 2012: Create the RC1,
- 31st January 2013: Release the version 4.

Timeline November 2012 1st Draft, January 2013 Final Release

So, let's start discussion about phase (1)!

Thanks!
Mat

Hello Matteo.

I made a cross reference between Top Ten and Testing Guide for the
Cheatsheet project Top Ten.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Cheat_Sheet

About the Table of Contents, is it the definitive one and we need only
to assign the contribuitors or we are going to discuss the table of
contents as well?

Regards.

I added myself in on a few topics where I felt I could contribute the
most. Not sure if that was the right thing to do or not.

If not, I'll take whatever assignment you wish.

Hi Brad,
that's ok we are a team!

My idea is also to contact the authors of the new testing techniques
asking for their contributes.

So for example I wish that for HTTP Verb Tampering, Arshan could help
and for HTTP Parameter pollution, Stefano and Luca can give us the
better contents.

Thanks!
Mat

Hi Mat and all

I'd also like to contribute.

As far as ToC concerned,
-Do we need to come up with something new from v3?

Introduction and Project purpose for v4:
============================ =============
The OWASP Testing Guide v3 includes a "best practice" penetration
testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations
and a "low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques
for testing most common web application and web service security
issues. Nowadays the Testing Guide has become the standard to perform
a Web Application Penetration Testing and many Companies all around
the world have adopted it.
It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that
represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

Project Roadmap
=============

- (1) 1st phase: Brainstorming and create a new table of contents

Objective: creating a new table of contents of the OTGv4
assigning a task for each contributor.
I created a new OWASP Testing Guide v4 table of Contents here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

- (2) 2nd phase:  Writing
20th September 2012: Start writing the articles
1st November 2012: 1st Draft
30th November: end of writing phase

- (3) 3rd phase: Reviewing

- 1st December 2012: Starting the review phase,
- 15th December 2012: Create the RC1,
- 31st January 2013: Release the version 4.

Timeline November 2012 1st Draft, January 2013 Final Release

So, let's start discussion about phase (1)!

Thanks!
Mat

Perfect,
thanks.

Yes we have to come with something new from v3. The v3 is the base for
the v4 but we have to review/update/cut all the contents and add new
contents.

Hi Amro,
good question related to the tools. Here we have to update many references.

Usually at the end of each article we suggest to use a particular open
source tool to perform the test. I think we can use and suggest both the
tools in many situations.
Also the Appendix A "Testing Tools" should pick all the testing tools
cited in the Testing Guide and give more details.

Thanks,
Mat

Hello everyone,

When looking at the ToC, I see that "Logout function not properly
implemented" is mentioned under "Authentication Testing", but shouldn't
this be mentioned under "Session Management Testing" since this
vulnerability is about the session which is not properly destroyed on the
server?

Then I would also propose to add the following 2 vulnerabilities/test
methods:

   1. Clickjacking a.k.a. "Frameable response": I would propose to add this
   in section "Configuration and Deploy Management Testing" since this
   vulnerability can be solved by adding the header "X-FRAME-OPTIONS" to the
   responses.
   2. CAPTCHA's: what are good ones and how can they be broken. I think
   this should be added in "Authentication testing"

Regards,
Lode

I think its right for us to suggest an open source tool (or tools) for
using in each section, however I dont think we should view this as a ZAP vs
WebScarab contest.
We want to suggest the best possible tool, but I also think that its
reasonable for us to *prefer *OWASP ones.
But we should also favour tools that are more mature and/or more frequently
updated.
For OWASP tools I think we can rely on the new classifications: Flagship,
Labs, Incubator, Archive.
So I think its really a sliding scale.
If theres a Flagship OWASP project that is great at finding a specific type
of vulnerability then we should definitely use that as the example.
If not then we have to balance how relevant that tool is likely to remain.
A brand new Incubator project might be great in one specific case, but may
also not really be in a fit state for most people to use, or the project
may quickly wither and die.
And if a well regarded non OWASP open source tool is the best option then
we should use that.

Going back to ZAP, I obviously hope it will be the ideal tool in many cases
:)
And helping to establish if this is the case and explaining exactly how ZAP
can be used may be the most effective way I can contribute to this guide.

But I also want to use this process to learn where ZAP's weaknesses are.
And depending on how long it takes to produce the guide we (the ZAP
developers) may be able to enhance specific areas of ZAP as the work on the
guide develops.
So please let me know asap if/when you work on an area of the guide that
you dont think ZAP is effective in helping with, or if you would like
advice and guidance on how to use ZAP as effectively as possible.

Cheers,

Simon (ZAP Project Lead)

Hi Lode,
good ideas.

I agree maybe "Logout function not properly implemented" is better under
"Session Management Testing". I've update the ToC

1. Testing for ClickJacking
Yes it's relative simple to solve this vulnerability.
But the TG is focused on how to test not how to solve the issues, so I
think from a logic and operative point of view this test is relative to
Client side testing not to Config and Deply testing. Do you agree?

2. Testing for Captcha: yes I've added it. We already did that paragraph
for v3:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Captcha_%28OWASP-AT-008%29

Thanks!
Mat

Hi Simon,
yep I agree.

Maybe we can distinguish as follow for each paragraph:
- OWASP Tools:
 (Flagship, Labs, Incubator, Archive)
- Other Open Source tools:

I think that a contributor should be dedicated to verifies which tests
are suitable using ZAP (maybe Amro who writes the Appendix A "Testing
Tools")?

Thanks,
Mat

hi all,

as for experience some people like to have a paragraph called "tools"

cheers,

X-FRAME-OPTIONS only provides a solution for modern/recent browser versions. It also assumes that all the proxies, devices, browsers and plugins that touch the traffic along the way are friendly and don't drop the header.

We should be careful in how we're positioning use of X-FRAME-OPTIONS, Content Security Policy (CSP), and the Origin header as at various points in their lives their usefulness has overlapped greatly.
XFO:

http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/03/30/combating-clickjacking-with-x-frame-options.aspx

CSP:

Origin header:
http://people.mozilla.com/~bsterne/content-security-policy/origin-header-proposal.html

While X-FRAME-OPTIONS should be part of the solution we should probably also recommend use of some type of JS based solution in conjunction.
http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/framebusting/framebust.pdf for more info.

On the topic of CAPTCHA testing I'd provide the following references for the consideration of whoever puts it together:
http://www.idontplaydarts.com/2012/01/extending-burp-suite-to-solve-recaptcha/
http://www.bonsai-sec.com/blog/index.php/breaking-weak-captcha-in-26-lines-of-code/ -> This one really hit home with me, I've used similar code and a batch script wrapper to loop through images and see if I can OCR them. It's also pretty simple to apply B&W filters or contrast modifications using simple code and the suggested libraries.

Hello everyone,

When looking at the ToC, I see that "Logout function not properly implemented" is mentioned under "Authentication Testing", but shouldn't this be mentioned under "Session Management Testing" since this vulnerability is about the session which is not properly destroyed on the server?

Then I would also propose to add the following 2 vulnerabilities/test methods:

 1.  Clickjacking a.k.a. "Frameable response": I would propose to add this in section "Configuration and Deploy Management Testing" since this vulnerability can be solved by adding the header "X-FRAME-OPTIONS" to the responses.
 2.  CAPTCHA's: what are good ones and how can they be broken. I think this should be added in "Authentication testing"
Regards,
Lode

Hi Ismael,
that's great!

ToC is a DRAFT now. We are at phase (1), we have to brainstorm now.

Thanks,
Mat

     Introduction and Project purpose for v4:
     ============================ =============
     The OWASP Testing Guide v3 includes a "best practice" penetration
     testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations
     and a "low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques
     for testing most common web application and web service security
     issues. Nowadays the Testing Guide has become the standard to perform
     a Web Application Penetration Testing and many Companies all around
     the world have adopted it.
     It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that
     represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

     Project Roadmap
     =============

     - (1) 1st phase: Brainstorming and create a new table of contents

     Objective: creating a new table of contents of the OTGv4
     assigning a task for each contributor.
     I created a new OWASP Testing Guide v4 table of Contents here:
     https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

     - (2) 2nd phase:  Writing
     20th September 2012: Start writing the articles
     1st November 2012: 1st Draft
     30th November: end of writing phase

     - (3) 3rd phase: Reviewing

     - 1st December 2012: Starting the review phase,
     - 15th December 2012: Create the RC1,
     - 31st January 2013: Release the version 4.

     Timeline November 2012 1st Draft, January 2013 Final Release

     So, let's start discussion about phase (1)!

     Thanks!
     Mat

We can add both based on the attack factor while list of Webscarab and 
ZAP capabilities will leave the tester to decide what tool to use 
without pushing him/her for a particular one.

below are my suggestions

*(Dedicated section for relevant OWASP tools as we need to attract 
supporters)*
**
*Tool Name:* X Y Z
*Project leader:* ( This will help the project leader getting 
suggestions to improve his/her project)
*Short introduction* ( high level introduction that should not exceed 
one or two lines)
*Features:* ( we can list them or provide a direct link to the project wiki)
*Video tutorial*: ( if applicable )
*Download: *( direct download link or the project wiki)

And so on .......

I think by doing the above we will hit two birds with one stone ( market 
our tools and leave the tester to decide what tool he/she need the most 
based on the tool features/capabilities)

Regards,
Amro

Hello all!

The following are some points I've noticed we can improve/add/discuss. It's
not organized, it's a brainstorm about some subjects. Maybe some of them
are already related with some section.
This weekend I'm gonna try to make it organized and submit it to the list.

General
    LFI/RFI

Application Discovery
    Entry points
       -> Include Ajax as well

ViewState tests (.NET/JSF)

SQL Injection
 Oracle
  BlindSQLInjection
  Out of band techniques
 SQLite
  Is it worth to add it?

SSO SAML (SSO Profile)
 -> Bind (post/get)
 -> Token Signature
 -> Anonymity
 -> OneTimeUse
 -> NotBefore
 -> Local Logout
 -> Global Logout
 -> DoS

DoS
 -> Slow HTTP Get
 -> Slow HTTP Pos

SSL Test
 -> Enhace (maybe based on Qualys SSLlabs results and tests?)

Evasive Techniques
 -> Is it worth? One per section or one chapter?

Top Ten X Testing Guide Cross-Reference Table

About the chapter Value The Real Risk I think we have to fix the
calculations.
I think the risk rates (low and high) compared to the examples are wrong.

Maybe somethings I put here is too specific but maybe it's worth to think
about one way to put them.

Regards.

For SQLi if we're including Oracle as its own sub-category it would make more sense from my perspective and experience to also include MS SQL and MySQL (vs. SQLite). (That's not meant to put down SQLite in any manner, I just see the other two as much more prevalent so far....)

We can add both based on the attack factor while list of Webscarab and ZAP capabilities will leave the tester to decide what tool to use without pushing him/her for a particular one.

below are my suggestions

(Dedicated section for relevant OWASP tools as we need to attract supporters)

Tool Name: X Y Z
Project leader: ( This will help the project leader getting suggestions to improve his/her project)
Short introduction ( high level introduction that should not exceed one or two lines)
Features: ( we can list them or provide a direct link to the project wiki)
Video tutorial: ( if applicable )
Download: ( direct download link or the project wiki)

And so on .......

I think by doing the above we will hit two birds with one stone ( market our tools and leave the tester to decide what tool he/she need the most based on the tool features/capabilities)

Amro

Hello!

I like Ismael's suggestions; I think LFI/RFI might be covered under
"TESTING FOR PATH TRAVERSAL (OWASP-AZ-001)" on the OWASP 3 guide.

I would also like to add a section for CMS/COTS software. I've noticed a
trend to use a CMS as a base for webapps, and then adding plugins for the
desired functionality. Sometimes people develop their own plugins. These
custom plugins end up being vulnerable most of the time. So maybe a
CMS/COTS Fingerprinting / Discovery would make sense? We could leverage
OWASP projects such as Joomla Scan.

Hello Rick.

I agree with you that Mysql and Sql is much more prevalent.
The fact is there are already Mysql/Sql Server sections in V3. I?ve put
Oracle just to ilustrate that is missing out of band and blind sql
injection techniques for Oracle specifically.
We should have the same techniques/sections for all SGDBs (whenever is
possible).

Regards.

Ismael Gon?alves

From the ToC it seems that JSON, RestFUL, SOAP front-end testing are already covered. This means the guide already has a lot of the relevant technical information. 

However, I agree with Eoin in that it could benefit from a dedicated mobile section that will talk about:
-  differences and similarities between a browser-client app and a mobile-client app from the server side aspects 
- points of interest when testing mobile apps (for example, adding phone-specific user-agent headers is often needed to access certain functionality aspects and achieve good testing coverage)
- tools that could be relevant - such as emulators or request generators for specific tasks 
- referring to relevant sections of the guide when talking about the protocols usually used for mobile-app traffic (the abovementioned JSON/REST/etc.). this should allow someone approaching to mobile-apps testing an understanding of what they are facing. 

Btw, if not too late - I'll be happy to contribute to the guide - provide content or as a reviewer.

Cheers,
Irene

Are we covering mobile testing at all?
Sorry if this was mentioned already.
