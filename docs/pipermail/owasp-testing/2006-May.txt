Message-ID: <f3193c100605250354y5e29cb52ie5159b6d64c40fc7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Can people tell me the status of the documents currently being written?
There are a number of areas that still require authors, so if you have a few
hours a week to spare and would like to contribute please drop me a line.

The Plan is to have a HTML indexable reference on the upandcomming
OWASP/PacketFocus Application Security Live CD.


Examples of sections/areas to be written, some of these sections are pretty
small and would not take much work.


   - Business logic testing
   - How To Go About Performing An Application Security Review
   - Principles of Testing
   - Testing Techniques Explained
   - Threat Modeling Introduction
   - Design Reviews
   - Threat Modeling the Application
   - Policy Reviews
   - Requirements Analysis
   - Developer Interviews and Interaction


Sections on How to test for:

Session Mgt:

   - Session ID predictability  - Using webscarab?
   - Session token generation
   - Token storage
   - Control for automated attacks? (ie. does the authentication
   mechanism block remote systems that try a brute force attack against a
   simple user/password form?)
   - Session hijacking
   - Session replay
   - Session manipulation
   - Inactivity timeout + Activity timeout
   - Expiration at logoff

*Data protection*

   - Sensitive data in source [ ]
   - Sensitive data in persistent cookies [ ]
   - Data storage [ ]
   - Improper use of cache control directives
   - Privileges granted from the web server to data backends (CMS or
   DBMS, many people use the admin users to connect both, i.e. 'sa' in
   MsSQL) [ ]
   - Improper use of cache control directives
   - Privileges granted from the web server to data backends (CMS or
   DBMS, many people use the admin users to connect both, i.e. 'sa' in
   MsSQ

MISC: These section are covered in the context of code review, with code
examples.
The sections below are to describe the "How TO" test for the following
vulns. They can be combined as appropriate

SQL  Injection
OS Injection
LDAP Injection
XSS Injection
Debug commands
 Null Bytes Unicode + URL Encode.

Help appreciated
