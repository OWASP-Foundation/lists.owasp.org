Yes, that's right Dinis.
But I've involved you because some changes have an impact on all the
OWASP Projects. I mean the problem to create a project that doesn't
overlap with the other ones.

I think that the Testing methodologies are:
Manual Inspection & Review
Threat Modeling
Code Review
Penetration Testing

I think that we have to write a chapter about that and create a link
with the other OWASP projects. In this chapter we can compare the
different methologies and talk about positive and negative issues.
After this we focus only about Penetration Testing otherwise we'll
make an overlap with the other projects and go outside the scope of
the Guide.
I think we can use a kind of threat modeling to create a framework to
evaluate the real risk after finding the technical vulnerabilities.

Rogan prototyped a Wiki2PDF solution for OWASP and it was pretty much
working.  It's not the prettiest in the world, but it did work.

Rogan, what's the status of that thing?

Hi all,
What do you think about the new Index?
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents

1) Look at the doc "OWASPTesting_PhaseOne"
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=62285)
IMHO I think we have to insert the Chaper 2" Principle of testing" ,
Chapter 3 "Testing techniques explained" and "The OWASP Testing
Framework" as first chapter of this guide.

2) I'd like to rename Chapter 4 from "Manual testing techniques" to
"Web Application Penetration Testing".

3) In accordance with Alberto Revelli, we think to create a new
template for Chapter 4:
1 Short Description of the Issue
2 How to Test
    2.1 Black Box testing and example
    2.2 White Box testing and example
3 References
    Whitepapers
    Tools
What do you think about that? More, may be we have to rename White Box
in Gray box, so it is clear the difference between penetration testing
(Black and Gray Box) and Code Review (White Box) that is a different
OWASP Project.

What are your feed back?
Thanks,
Mat

Hi,

Sounds very promising but take into account that the Autumn of Code project
is of a finite time.

It is important to consider:

In order to re-write all the chapters AND add the required new content shall
take some time. The completion date is the 31st December 2006 which gives us
about 11 weeks, not much time from my experience of developing the existing
Testing guide.

It would be better not to take too much on and miss the completion date. The
guide shall be ever evolving and the aim of this AoC project is to
consolidate the existing guide and NOT to perform a complete rewrite.

So my concern is the amount of time we have to complete this project Vs the
ever expanding scope of work.

regards,

Eoin,
OWASP Testing Guide Lead and coordinator.

Hi,

I think that the new index is good but the Phase 4 (During development) is
useless in this testing guide (I think).
How do you feel about this?

Bye bye
Carlo

Hi,
If you fee that we could "Push" any of the sections into the code review
guide or the Development guide please suggest.

Hi all,

I believe that we might use the already existing work realized in other
projects (as the Threat Classification, WASC). Of this way, we might
include the above mentioned threats and, in addition, to use a standard
terminology.

The problem is that we do not have too much time, so I propose the
following changes:

In the section "4.3 Business logic testing", I would add:
- Abuse of Functionality
- Insufficient Process Validation

In the section "4.6 Data Validation Testing", I would classify XSS's
attacks:
- Stored
- Reflected

I would create a new point "4.6.3 Command Execution" that would include
the following ones:
- ORM Injection
- LDAP Injection
- XML Injection
- SSI Injection
- XPath Injection
- SQL Injection
- IMAP/SMTP Injection
- Code Injection
- OS Commanding 

In the section "4.8 Infrastructure and configuration Testing" I would
create a point:
- Information disclosure
about this aspects:
- Directory indexing
- Information leakage
- Path Traversal
- Predictable Resource Location


What does seem to you?

Regards,
-- Vicente Aguilera

		Hi everyone,

I am new to the testing list, so please forgive my presumptuousness, but I think 3.4 Phase 3 absolutely needs to be here.  Moreover,  I believe UNIT TESTING needs to be added to 3.4 Phase 3.  In my opinion, it would be a mistake to *not* include a section for testing during development.  There are several tools for this, JUNIT, NUNIT, FxCOP that can be used to check for function bounds and any security rules.

Regards,

Mark

Sounds very promising but take into account that the Autumn of Code project is of a finite time.

It is important to consider:

In order to re-write all the chapters AND add the required new content shall take some time. The completion date is the 31st December 2006 which gives us about 11 weeks, not much time from my experience of developing the existing Testing guide. 

It would be better not to take too much on and miss the completion date. The guide shall be ever evolving and the aim of this AoC project is to consolidate the existing guide and NOT to perform a complete rewrite. 

So my concern is the amount of time we have to complete this project Vs the ever expanding scope of work.

Yes, I'd like to use the same vision of the OWASP Guide, so we can use
the same terminology and same approch of writing. Answers in line.

Thanks,
Mat

Yes you are right: but you can discuss these items inside the
paragraph 4.3. Otherwise the index become too much longer.
May you look at this paragraph as template?

Right, but the same said above

Ok, perfect. That is the right direction

I agree, may be a sub-paragraph "Information disclosure" is fine.

Hi Mark,

I wrote a paper and a presentation on this very topic for the past  
OWASP EU conference:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ 
Image:AutomatedSecurityTestingofWebApplications-StephendeVries.pdf

Some of the main points:
- Security testing is not that different from other software testing
- Security testing can easily be integrated into unit testing,  
integration testing and functional testing phases
- There are a wealth of tools available for unit testing that can be  
used for security testing, such as the unit testing frameworks,  
apache cactus, htmlunit, httpunit, WATIR (for ruby), and more.

I'd be glad to rework some of the material to fit into the guide, if  
you decide it's appropriate.

regards,
Stephen

Steve - 

Great - I'll take a look at your presentation later today.  Your points are
correct.  I've trained several teams of devs and fought battles with project
managers to get security design and testing (unit and functional) and so far
have had no major security breaches with those teams (yet).  I don't think
this stuff though has made it the general development population at large.
They know to validate input - but not exactly why or what damage incorrectly
validated input causes.

Regards,

Mark

Some of the tools, particularly the functional testing tools, could  
be of a lot of use to penetration testers too.
For example, the WATIR tool (http://wtr.rubyforge.org/) provides a  
ruby interface to IE, so you can control an instance of IE from a  
script.
Here's an example of a simple test using WATIR that performs 2 SQL  
injection tests in a login form:

require 'unittests/setup'
require 'watir'

$APP_HOME = 'http://localhost:8080/ispatula'
$USERNAME = 'corsaire1'
$PASSWORD = 'corsaire1'
$SQL_CONCAT_USERNAME = 'corsaire\'+\'1'

class SQL_Injection_Test < Test::Unit::TestCase
     include Watir

     def test_SQL_Blind_Injection()
         $ie.goto($APP_HOME)
         $ie.link(:url, /signonForm.do/).click
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set($USERNAME+'\' OR 1=1--')
         $ie.form(:action, "/ispatula/shop/signon.do").submit
         assert($ie.contains_text('Signon failed'));
     end

     def test_SQL_Injection_String_Concat()
         $ie.goto($APP_HOME)
         $ie.link(:url, /signonForm.do/).click
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set($SQL_CONCAT_USERNAME)
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'password').set($PASSWORD)
         $ie.form(:action, "/ispatula/shop/signon.do").submit
         assert($ie.contains_text('Signon failed'));
     end
end

HtmlUnit, Httpunit, jWebUnit and others provide similar functionality  
by using their own HTTP client rather than IE.
I think these could very powerful tools in a security tester's hands,

Both Compuware TestPartner and VS.NET 2005 have a "recording" tool to
actually record the tests to C# code and can target many different browsers
(I'm sure there are others out there).  I've used the output of these as a
final run in a continuous integration environment that automatically builds
and tests nightly.

Some of the tools, particularly the functional testing tools, could be of a
lot of use to penetration testers too.
For example, the WATIR tool (http://wtr.rubyforge.org/) provides a ruby
interface to IE, so you can control an instance of IE from a script.
Here's an example of a simple test using WATIR that performs 2 SQL injection
tests in a login form:

require 'unittests/setup'
require 'watir'

$APP_HOME = 'http://localhost:8080/ispatula'
$USERNAME = 'corsaire1'
$PASSWORD = 'corsaire1'
$SQL_CONCAT_USERNAME = 'corsaire\'+\'1'

class SQL_Injection_Test < Test::Unit::TestCase
     include Watir

     def test_SQL_Blind_Injection()
         $ie.goto($APP_HOME)
         $ie.link(:url, /signonForm.do/).click
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set($USERNAME+'\' OR 1=1--')
         $ie.form(:action, "/ispatula/shop/signon.do").submit
         assert($ie.contains_text('Signon failed'));
     end

     def test_SQL_Injection_String_Concat()
         $ie.goto($APP_HOME)
         $ie.link(:url, /signonForm.do/).click
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set($SQL_CONCAT_USERNAME)
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'password').set($PASSWORD)
         $ie.form(:action, "/ispatula/shop/signon.do").submit
         assert($ie.contains_text('Signon failed'));
     end
end

HtmlUnit, Httpunit, jWebUnit and others provide similar functionality by
using their own HTTP client rather than IE.
I think these could very powerful tools in a security tester's hands, and
since they're quite intuitive to use you don't really need a strong
programming background.

regards,
Stephen

Hi all,
Some questions & thought about the new index:

where would you think we should introduce 
HTTP {request,response}  {splitting,smuggling} in the index?
Maybe it could be on a new sub-paragraph in 4.6 Data Validation Testing
as HTTP Headers Injection, or should it be described in 4.6.1.3 HTTP
Methods + XSS ?

Moreover what about WEBDAV? Maybe this one could be inserted in this
latter par. 4.6.1.3 HTTP Methods. Or into '4.8 Infrastructure and
configuration Testing'?

What about Session fixation? Of course we should introduce it in 4.5
Session Management Testing, maybe in 4.5.1 Cookie and Session token
Manipulation(reg, forg/brute force).

Then about XSS let's remember about DOM Injection as XSS of third kind
(i agree it should be described directly in  4.6.1 Cross site
scripting).

Some other attacks that comes in my mind:
DNS Pinning 
Domain Contamination
..or maybe these are a kind of 'off topic' in the guide...

Another thought about classification which is maybe a little generic
but... what about creating two big categories like 'Client side' and
'server side' or it's better to categorize as attacks types and not as
attack targets..

Yes I know..too much questions but it's brainstorming, right? :)

Regards 
Stefano

I agree with Carlo, "3.4 Phase 3" overlap whit "Code review project" IMHO.

Ok, security code review is fundamental, but there is a completely 
different project for that, it is useless to overlap the two project.
We can link the section with the Code review projects.

One thing again, I think we can avoid to rename White box in Gray box, 
because the "Phase 2" is about white box and not gray box methodology.

>From my understanding, Chapter 3 is aimed to provide a general framework
that describes the testing methodologies that are better suited for each
step of the development cycle. The goal is to help the reader to
understand when to use each method (Risk Analysis, Threat Modeling,
Penetration Testing, Code Review, ...)
It does not get into any detailed description (Chapter 4 will do that,
and only for penetration testing). As long as we limit ourselves to a
short paragraph about what Code Review is and when it is to be used, and
provide a link to the corresponding OWASP project, we do not risk any
overlapping.

We have to define exactly what we mean with "gray box" and "white box".
To me, "gray box" is when we have some sort of initial information to
start with (e.g.: web server vendor and version, algorithm used to
generate a cookie, ...), as opposed to "black box" testing, in which we
start with no information at all.
When I think about "white box", I imagine a situation in which I have
*all* the information about the application, source code included.
Therefore, I think that the "white box" expression should indicate an
approach based on Code Review.

Hi,

Great progress everyone.  I'd really like to see references to articles
already at OWASP about the various attacks and vulnerabilities you're
testing for.  Check the Honeycomb project for lots of these.  This will
help to reduce overlap and redundancy.

1: totally agree, so many people today still dont understand the  
voodoo we do.

2: again great idea

3: Always been a tricky section and its why we initially have grey/ 
black and white. In reality you get white or black (i consider grey  
to be more of a marketing term than anything else)

Hi Eoin here (got to get rid of this hotmail acocunt, its so uncool :)

Eoin: If you think about it many many things could go into the DV section.
It would be best to  put it in a HTTP section.

Eoin: WEBDAV, I would say this would also go under HTTP as it is HTTP 
extensions.

Eoin: Keep Session fixation in session mgt. when doc is done depending on 
the flow we may move it.

Eoin: Agreed, keep all the XSS together. It shall be easier to find this 
way. We should think about the book as a reference.

Eoin: A Little off topic but if required in an explanation refer to the 
wikipedia definition or some such ref.

Eoin: Lets go with attack types. but we could Tag them in the future as 
Client or backend.

Hi,

Question:
Do we want to get into Unit Testing and SDLC methodology in this guide?
I thought they would be more suite to Andrews dev guide or the code review 
project.
unit testing is related to testing small blocks of a syaytem individually 
and hence a development phase done prior to system and integration testing.
The Guide currently focuses on penetration testing which is "After the Fact" 
testing and not really one until the system in developed.

What y'all think?

Eoin

Agreed.

Apart from the review of a more general framework in Chapter 3, I
believe the guide should remain focused of pure penetration testing and
leave everything that is related to the development phases to the
projects you mentioned

Hi all,

my first post and 2 cents here:

I guess we should make a difference between the techniques of unit
testing and the results of UT. Even if UT can be used to... e.g.,
discover BO or SQL-injection vulns.

Although, I noticed that there is an Appendix for fuzzing which is
another technique for discovering (some) vulnerabilities.


A new question: imagine the following situation: The pen tester
discovers a SQL-injection vulnerability in a webapp he is auditing. This
vuln. allows him to store some javascript in the Db and therefore
perpetrate a XSS attack (incubated) on the users of this webapp.  My
question is where do we describe this attacks? (I think they are
important enough to be included somewhere.)

Cheers,
Ariel

Eoin,

I think you are correct, now that I reread the purpose of the document.

Here's my thoughts:

Thinking in terms of pen testing - we probably should look at the OSSTMM or
NIST guidelines for a framework for pen testing (the sections in question are
under the OWASP Testing Framework).

Basically this is the NIST framework (it's short and sweet -
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-42/NIST-SP800-42.pdf section
3.10 can be adapted from Network to Website):  

1. Planning - what is the purpose of the attack, what resources do I need, is
it black, white or grey, do I have a get out of jail free card. 

2. Discovery - Server identification, technology and version, available
exploits, research without "breaking and entering"

3. Attack - Self explanatory

And

4. Reporting - for each stage, the pen tester needs to provide a report of the
phase - Planning - have all your docs good to go.  Discover - document your
findings.  Attack - summarize the attack - use indicators for High, Medium, Low
Risk for each test item.

If we incorporate these into the document, then we can attribute NIST and
OSSTMM (is there a EU framework? Does BS7799 have anything like that?)

Let me know what you guys think,

Mark

Hi,

Question:
Do we want to get into Unit Testing and SDLC methodology in this guide?
I thought they would be more suite to Andrews dev guide or the code review 
project.
unit testing is related to testing small blocks of a syaytem individually 
and hence a development phase done prior to system and integration testing.
The Guide currently focuses on penetration testing which is "After the Fact" 
testing and not really one until the system in developed.

What y'all think?

Eoin

In terms of a purely Penetration testing framework viewpoint -

Unit Testing can be very useful in the Discovery phase (Plan, Discover, Attack,
Report) - I can use a tool like JAD, .NET Reflector, et al to decompile a web
app - function by function.  Then using JUNIT or NUNIT or any other testing
suite, automate the unit test per function and fuzz for vulnerabilities.  That,
to me, is an appropriate penetration testing exercise.

About hybrid attacks,  I've heard of contests where the cracker who used the
most types of attacks won.  For example, here's a bunch of different attacks in
a session:  breach a firewall, arp poison a router, buffer overflow a server,
rootkit the server, sniff the network, steal userids and passwords, send
e-mails from within the mail network, and on and on.  It's the antithesis to
risk analysis and layering defense ;)  It would be helpful to identify patterns
- not sure if I've seen any public work on Web attack patterns.

Hi,
incubated attacks are important enough to warrant a section under XSS. It is
another varient of XSS.
Metteo what do you think?

4.4.5 Phising attacks / two facto authentication testing
4.4.6 Encrypted password strength testing
4.4.7 CAPTCHA strength

Should we inculde these under section 4? 

Phising attacks success rate depend on the authentication mechanism (For
eg,.Two facto may be little diff than single password), should we inclue
something for two facto authentication test?

Aplogies if I hv suggested anything irrelevent.

Hi,

Great progress everyone.  I'd really like to see references to articles
already at OWASP about the various attacks and vulnerabilities you're
testing for.  Check the Honeycomb project for lots of these.  This will
help to reduce overlap and redundancy.

Yes,
I think you are right: this paragraph already exists.
look at:
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents)
4.6 Data Validation Testing 0% TD
4.6.1 Cross site scripting 0% TD
4.6.1.1 Incubated attacks 0% TD

Ariel may be says that Incubated attacks are a combination of SQL Inj
and XSS, but we can reasonably affirm that is a particular XSS attack.
In the same paragraph we can show an example that how a XSS Inc Attack
works exploiting an SQL Inj vulnerability.
Right?

The whole bag of fun that is XSS needs to be thought about in a clear  
manner.
Are we going to talk about ever possible xss mutation, such as:

Basic
HTML element
Character Encoding
Embedded Character
Event handlers
HTML Quote Encapsulation
URL obfuscation

Or are we going to concentrate on the basics?

Yes, that's the focal point of the project.
As Eoin sayd, we have a finite time (31th dec for a complete guide).
The fact is that today we have written nearly nothing about XSS and
many other items.

So the idea is:
- 5th November: 1st dead line to cover the basic and create link to whitepapers
- Then review all, finish the par. not yet completed
- Then if we have time, we can go in details on each par.

That make sense?

Guys,

when doing these articles can we ensure that the articles are practical and
pragmatic?
I.e. Examples of the test discussed and less academic theory.
Just that, there are many books out there on the "theory" but what we need
is examples of "how to test"..

What do y'all think?

Yep,
Eoin is right. We don't need to write down all the theory about a
particular attack, but just a brief description. The added value of
this guide is our experience on how to test. Focus on real
case-studies will be great. IMHO this concept has to be our guideline
in writing new articles.
Other feed back?

examples are good. Ideally they should give an introduction of what  
the tester is testing for, a brief explanation and the actual method  
used to test and desired output


=======================================================
Topic:

XSS IFRAME Test

Explanation:

HTML frames allow authors to present documents in multiple views,  
which may be independent windows or subwindows. These are commonly  
found to be vulnerable, and if the web application allows iframes,  
there could be further XSS vulnerabilities present

Testing for IFRAME vulnerabilities:
Using a proxy, recreate the IFRAME code with following code
<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert(;'OWASP IFRAME XSS Test');"></IFRAME>

Result Expected:
A alert box with the caption "OWASP IFRAME XSS Test" should appear

That makes lots of sense.  You can link to the "Attack" or
"Vulnerability" category articles on the subject which will have the
full background.

Daniel and all,
this is the right direction IMHO, too.

as Matteo  pointed in his first mail:
_snip_
" ....
3) In accordance with Alberto Revelli, we think to create a new
template for Chapter 4:
1 Short Description of the Issue
2 How to Test
    2.1 Black Box testing and example
    2.2 White Box testing and example
3 References
    Whitepapers
    Tools 
...."
_snip_

Apart from 2.2, which maybe could be redirected to code review, it seems
to me the same practical approach.

I agree that a very light and pragmatic reference guide with links to
attack theory and tools is what we need.


Very good idea for 'Result Expected:' !

Maybe some antifiltering/metachars attack related list or reference
( where a list would be too long ) could be useful as a sub paragraf of
the attack technique.

IMHO, of course...

Stefano

You are right. It is a simple XSS incubated attack.

But on the other hand, now that I continue to think about it... What
about using a SQL-injection vulnerability to upload code to the Db, next
if the server has shell enabled this can be used to execute this code?
(I Googled an example of sth like this for attacking PHP's PMA that I
copy below.)

The point is that if the pentester discovers a SQL-injection, he might
be able to do a lot of things. It appears that the SQL-injection gives
the pentester a new /asset/ (the ability to make certain queries to
certain tables in the Db). After it, with all the information he has
gathered so far, the pen tester will decide what to do. Probably, he
will want to research the implications of the SQL-injection
vulnerability. Collegue Gerardo Richarte has proposed this methodology
(see, e.g., slides form his PacSec Japan 2003 talk) over the traditional
(IG, Attack, Pentrate and report) approach.

Moreover, sometimes during a pen test it isn't just enough to discover a
SQL-injection. You need to prove the impact of this vulnerability to
developers that think it is inofensive and shouldn't be fixed.

Then my question is: should we include a prelude on pen testing
methodology before 4.1? Then, in accordance with Matt's suggestion,
should each section (e.g., XSS incubated attacks) include a subsection
where all the attacks assume that condition X holds (where X is some
sort of SQL-injection vulnerability was found, or such permissions are
badly set, et cetera)? I think this might be beneficial to the readers.

sure,
but we can not take into account every variant of attack for each
vulnerability discovered.
If one discovers SQL injection it is up to them to use a little skill in
order to exploit this vulnerability.
Also all systems are different so the list of variants  would be endless.
I believe we need to take a "middle" approach here and show how to do stuff
or disover vulnerabilities but exploitation it the area that takes some
skill and also alot of trial and error.
Documenting all the "vectors" of attack would increase the workload of the
project and we only have until December.
but it is a good idea never-the-less.

Just a couple of things that come to my mind (thanks to Matteo and
Alberto)...

Data Validation Testing chapter misses a little par. about 
directory traversal/local file include and remote file include.

Another point is about athentication and authorization chapter, on pages
which miss to exit on a redirection when they find the login/passwd are
wrong. 
An example below in Php:
<?
if(islogged())
header("Location : redir.php")
// without exit and then login page follows
logged-in code..-.
?>

Maybe in this cases a paragraph is worth writing to cover the issue and
to point out the use of command line raw requests like curl and related.

Cool brainstorming!
Here my idea:

why not choose a common and, if possible, fixed template for every
paragraph, so as to increase readablenes: this is a test guide, not
the encyclopedia of web applications attacks but noteven a simple
checklist...

Without common template does not exist an paragraph similar to an other

My (poor) example for paragraph template:

attack theory and requirements
code
practical examples
attended issue
impact
countermeasures
tips
other attacks correlation (a clew between attacks)
reference
tools

etc etc

Feel free to add or delete items

Matteo

Hi Matteo,
in our last discussions we have defined a template like that:

* Short Description of the Issue (Topic and Explanation)
* Black Box testing and example
   - Testing for Topic X vulnerabilities:
   - Result Expected:
* Gray Box testing and example (if any)
   - Testing for Topic X vulnerabilities:
   - Result Expected:
* References
   - Whitepapers
   - Tools

Dan, I've merged the old teplate with your idea...does it works for you?
Any other suggestions/comments

Thanks,
Mat

Perfect.
Thank you Stefano, I've added:
4.4.4 Directory traversal/file include

What about your second idea...where can we insert this item?

I've talked about "4.2 Information Gathering" and "4.8 Infrastructure
and configuration Testing" with Carlo and Stefano.
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents)

May be we can merge these like that (deleting par.4.8):

4.2 Information Gathering
4.2.1 Spidering and googling
4.2.2 Analisys of error code
4.2.3 Infrastructure configuration management testing
SSL/TLS Testing
4.2.4 Application configuration management testing
File extensions handling
Old, backup and unreferenced files

What is your opinion?
Mat

Jeff, is this a ongoing issue with our implementation of the Wiki? do  
Wiki know themselves out the bug?

Hi,
After a long brainstorming with Stefano, our idea is to change Data
Validation paragraph as follow:
DATA VALIDATION

4.6.1 Cross site scripting 0% TD
4.6.1.1 HTTP Methods and XST 0% TD
//(Phishing +XSS is not a test, but a particular attack. So we can
describe it like an //example in 4.6.1)

//(more rational par about SQL Injection)
4.6.2 SQL Injection 0% TD
4.6.2.1 Stored procedure injection 0% TD
4.6.2.2 Oracle testing,
4.6.2.3 MySQL testing,
4.6.2.4 SQL Server testing
// 4.6.2.4 Listener Testing - is an infrastructural testing

//(a par. for every different test)
4.6.3 ORM Injection
4.6.4 LDAP Injection
4.6.5 XML Injection,
4.6.6 SSI Injection,
4.6.7 XPath Injection
4.6.8 IMAP/SMTP Injection
4.6.9 Code Injection
4.6.10 OS Commanding

4.6.11 Buffer overflow Testing
4.6.11.1 Heap overflow
4.6.11.2 Stack overflow
4.6.11.3 Format string

4.6.12 Incubated vulnerability testing
//(we see this like an advanced testing that exploits multiple vulnerabilities)

What do you think about that?

Thanks again Stefano.
Mat

MediaWiki should be fine - I use Safari as my primary browser, and  
haven't noticed too many problems.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] WARNING: Dummies & Managers Ahead (aka my 2 cents
	for you...)
Message-ID: <55a185190610180055g28d56c14hc35a7fb77c9ea34@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

PREAMBLE: this mail was meant to be a couple lines long but went out
of my hand... If you have only a minute or so go to <PROPOSAL> section
directly...

<WHOAMI>

My name is Matteo Flora and I'm very pleased to meet you all... I met
Matt and Alberto here in Italy and they told me to sign on to the ML
and take a look at the document...

Well, it surely is something worth looking at!

Just my passing 2 cents: I'm basically a "political" sort of guy,
directing Italian Privacy and Security Observatory (OPSI) and with a
leading role in Italian Computer Society (AIP)...
I struggle everyday to take some kind of awareness in Corporate and
Gov, with direct connection with Italian (and to minimum degree
European) institutes for adoption of Sec methodologies.

But I'm not here to talk about me ;)

<THEPROBLEM>

I was pointing to Matt and Alberto that the actual document is a
perfect example of what a methodology should be and I scarcely am able
to think to anything that isn't covered in there (while I confess huge
gaps in methodologies I didn't even know the name of!).
Working with management (ISO27001) I often am able to see at the
adoption route of a methodology over another and I have a couple of
observation to share with you (each of them not worth more than my 2
eurocents)....

We're facing a couple  problems:

1) Pentester aren't uniformly  SMART
While we're here and we know what to do and how (well, at least YOU
DO) many pentesters or wannabe in the world don't know much about
in-depth methodologies and so on. Many of them simply rely on
off-the-shelf tools and off-the-shelf methodologies and even if these
are NOT what PT should be we must be aware of their existence.

2) Managers tend to screen methodologies
IT world has changed in the last few years even on the side of
management: typical European manager (or PM) is nowaday a hybrid
figure closer than before to code and developing. He tends to look
deeply at methodologies and being security the "buzz of these years"
each manager tend to spot his competence in this field.

How does this affect us at all?

Well, nowadays we see a plethora of new certifications, methodologies,
tools, codes, guidelines, best practices and so on scattered around
and each of them is used or not based on two factors: political power
of the solution (i.e. ISO) and ease of adoption.

While we cannot impact (right now) on the "political power" of OWASP
we can impact deeply on the ease of use. If people are able to use our
document they'll gladly adopt it.

BUT (there's always a BUT.... Murphy thing, you understand...)

It is my opinion that the actual structure of the document will
represent a very though and steep entry-level to a poorly skilled
pentester and/or to a manager.
Let me clear up: that's not necessarily a PROBLEM... We could happily
say "f*ck the dummies, this is a pro document", but I think we'll
loose 80% of possible audience. In addition to this let's remember
that the TESTING document is in many cases far more important than
Coding Guidelines! Why's that? It's simple: reviewing and testing an
application if far easier than building a perfect one and even if a
manager isn't maybe able to review the code he can look at injections
and hijacking quite easily....

<PROPOSAL>

I propose to prepend EACH technique (all the 4.x.x paragraph) with a
"for dummies" paragraph meant to be read by people that don't know
about the problem and giving a little insight on the subject from a
NON TECH view. LANGUAGE will be different, avoiding techie slang and
FORM would be different, outlining concepts instead of points....
I DO NOT suggest a "for dummy" title, but something like "Overview"
and "Technology" division....

Let's take a look to an example:

e.g. "Being able to tamper with cookies may result in hijacking the
sessions of legitimate users"

Will become:

"Manipulating the cookie content may result, and often results, in
changing the environment and may lead to simulate another user or to
gain unauthorized privileges or access"

The aim is to let a TOTAL IDIOT (like me =]) understand what we're
talking about without falling into technical speech too much and
without letting the subject to frighten a reader.
In addition to this not anyone is prepared to cope with every subject
and more often than not I'm sure that people will thank us for that
and our introduction will explain them what to read and how to
document on a peculiar subject...

I'll be able (as an ignorant) to take a look at most of the subjects
and to write briefings but what I'd really like is to know what do you
all think about this approach...

Matt gave me an overenthusiastic feedback, but we all know Matt ;)

Ok, sorry to have wasted so much of your time and let me know if I've
been not clear...


Ciao!

I think this is an excellent idea. I've found that while the "dummies"
don't generally care too much exactly how a vulnerability works, they
are quite interested in the attack scenario and the impact.  It's
difficult to write these sections clearly, so it would be nice to have a
sort of formula for this section -- something like...

"This [vulnerability] would allow a [threat agent] could [do something
technical], enabling them to cause [system impact]. For many
applications this vulnerability could cause [business impact]."

So, for example, your example would be something like...

"This weak session cookie vulnerability would allow an anonymous
internet user to forge cookie-style authentication credentials, enabling
them to access the accounts of legitimate users. For many applications,
this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access users' personal
information, resulting in serious confidentiality, privacy, and
integrity problems as well as reputation damage."

The idea sounds very good to me, and would increase the number of our
potential readers.

What we can do is to add a "summary" or "abstract" to the beginning of
each topic.
The summary must not be longer than 50/60 words, and must clearly answer
the following two questions:

1. What kind of vulnerability are we testing ?
2. What are the risks posed by such a vulnerability ?

The second point is very important, as it would provide a non-technical
reader (read: a suit) a quick understanding of the danger, and it would
make the guide a good reference point also from a risk assessment
perspective.

As a further example, here's how I'd write a summary for "googling":

==SUMMARY==
This test checks whether queries to search engines can provide
information that is not supposed to be public.
The impact of the vulnerability is the disclosure of
proprietary/confidential information.

Great idea, though i'd like us to not use the dummy connotation :0)

The biggest issue i've seen recently is the lack of testing  
experience with todays batch of pentesters. Maybe it's me being a old  
fart, but i feel todays testers dont have the background knowledge  
and act using the HackingExposed (tm) methodology.

Matteo, your idea is brilliant and one that needs to be included

I like the idea.  A second, almost as important function IMHO, would be to
standardize our classification.  I think it would be useful for our
community to standardize what we communicate to our sponsors (managers,
clients, etc.).  How does the open source community define a Web Service -
XML Structural attack?  We would be somewhat creating an pentesting
"industry-accepted" definition in "management" speak.

Great idea, though i'd like us to not use the dummy connotation :0)

The biggest issue i've seen recently is the lack of testing  
experience with todays batch of pentesters. Maybe it's me being a old  
fart, but i feel todays testers dont have the background knowledge  
and act using the HackingExposed (tm) methodology.

Matteo, your idea is brilliant and one that needs to be included

Perfect.
So I'll update the template for the paragraphs in Chapter 4 including
"In brief" or "Summary" at the top.

Mark, I think we have to update the optimum doc Checklist v1.1 with
the list of test we decribe (looking also at HoneyComb project as Jeff
said), and include it at the top of Chapter 4 (Web App Pen Testing).
Then make a link with Chapter 5 in wich we describe a methology to
value the REAL risk of the vulnerabilities founded: also in this
chapter we can make the difference from a management point of view
because we'll show numbers ! ;)

Subject: [Owasp-testing] off topic? Web application discovery
Message-ID: <453638f1.1cb93d8c.05a4.ffffe814@mx.google.com>

Don't know if you agree to include the following stuff in the testing guide
or not... I'd say it fits into 4.2.x

 

The following considerations apply to black box testing.

 

With the proliferation of virtual web servers, the traditional 1:1-type
relationship between an IP address and a web server is loosing much of its
original significance. It is not uncommon to have multiple web sites /
applications whose symbolic names resolve to the same IP (and this scenario
is not limited to hosting environments, but applies to ordinary corporate
environments as well).

Sometimes you are given a bunch of IP addresses (maybe just one...) to test.
No other knowledge. You may argue this is more of a pentest-type engagement,
but in my experience it is not that infrequent, and if you stumble on a
webapp, you test it, right? Problem is, the IP address they gave you hosts
an http service on port 80, but if you access it specifying the IP address
(which is all you know) it reports "No web server configured at this
address" or a similar message. But that box could "hide" a bunch of webapps,
associated to unrelated symbolic (DNS) names. Obviously the extent of your
analysis is deeply affected by the fact that you test the applications, or
you do not - because you don't notice them, or you notice only SOME of them.

Again, in my experience sometimes clients refuse to give more information in
addition to IP addresses, or they provide incomplete name lists (!) so it is
worth to do a discovery.

 

Determining black-box which virtual servers reside on the same IP is not a
trivial task, and in general has not a complete solution.

I have compiled a list of services on the web which may be used to help into
this sort of reverse queries (some of them do DNS name searching, which is
equally important: given a domain name, find which symbolic names are
defined - in absence of zone transfers, obviously). Of course contributions
are welcome. These services tend to return different results (because are
often partial results), so it's better to try many of them for "better
coverage".

 

netcraft search DNS: http://searchdns.netcraft.com/?host

Domain tools reverse IP: http://www.domaintools.com/reverse-ip/ (requires
free membership)

msn search: search.msn.com, syntax: "ip:x.x.x.x" (without the quotes)

webhosting info: http://whois.webhosting.info/,
http://whois.webhosting.info/x.x.x.x (reverse IP)

DNSstuff: http://www.dnsstuff.com/ (multiple services)

http://net-square.com/msnpawn/index.shtml (multiple queries on domains and
IP addresses, must be installed)

tomDNS: http://www.tomdns.net/ (some services still private)

SEOlogs.com http://www.seologs.com/ip-domains.html (reverse ip/domain
lookup)

 

 

To sum it up: Technically it's not web app assessment, but often may be a
prerequisite. In my opinion, it naturally fits into the Information
Gathering phase.

 

cheers,

 

Mauro

That's fine.
We can add a new "4.2.1 Application Discovery"...before spindering and googling.
What do you think?

Hi, Matteo, Eoin Here.
If one needs theory it can be found in other sections of the OWASP site.
One issue the OWASP leaders have defined is that the we do not required
overlap in the site.

If one needs to understand the issue from a technology perspective it can be
found elsewhere in the site.

I think the  agreement already is to stick to the "how to test" information
and leave the theory and background other section of the site which already
exist.

Hope this explains it,

Eoin

HI Matteo,
If the majority of the team wish to add the "idiots guide" (this makes me
smile), then so be it, cool.

I think we should be carefull that we dont reinvent  the wheel or repeat
definitions that we already have on the site. We can simply add a URL to a
section on the OWASP site to the same information.?

Matteo (Meucci), as technical AoC lead, its your call, if thats  ok with
everyone?

I don't want to prolong this anymore, but I'd recommend that we enforce that
it be a very brief description (I'd say a bullet item - powerpoint stuff).
You'll lose the reader if he/she's an idiot anyway ;)

Hi Eoin and thanx for the answer,

sorry for being blunt, but I humbly think this way you'll just loose
80% of the audience. 
The world isnt' made by pentest-geniouses and while I don't suggest to
explain "what a cookie is" I strongly suggest to give the idiots a
chance...

"That's, of course, just my 2eurocents, but you can't suppose everyone 
will know everything and all the document risks to be setted in a
corner for reference only by managers. And this means it will be
setted in a corner by decision makers. And this means less and less
adoption... 

That's, of course, just my opinion having to handle to tenths of
organizations that choose ISO27001 over OSSTTMM for VA only because
thay understand the former and not the latter...

This said it's not a religious belief on my side and I may be (and 
probabily am) wrong...

Think about how many people know laws... And what's the problem of laws?

"The former article XXX of YYY is changed according to YYY and XXX
while articole WWW will modify TTT to be real at EEE on ZZZ." 



My 2eurocents as always and I'll not pursue this more.

Hi all,

IMHO we should try to be concise with everything that is repeated
elsewhere and give pointers so that newbies can follow. On the other
hand, it is really a nuisance to follow eight links to read one article,
so there should be some tradeoff (which each contributor could manage
with out further explainations). :)

Cheers,
Ariel

Hey Seba,

Fine with me as long as we do not keep repeating ourselves throughout the
site.
It's Matteo's call.

Regarding the reporting stuff we also do some work with the metrics project.
Especially in the categorisation of severity and criticality context. ie.
"What is High severity, what is med, how do we define this as each project
is unique and vulns are context sensitive.

Nice one. Keep up all this good stuff and conversation. Things are really
shaping up well.
A real AoC success story, so far :0)
Eoin

Perfect...
ok,our world is open and democratic...so, I count more guys that are
pro the Matteo Flora idea. So we can add a very short "Summary" in
which we describe in "natural
language" what we want to do (very very short summary).

If we take a look at the table of Contents:

I think we have set up a great team...thanks all!

Now I suggest to begin using the power of Wiki and begin writing the paragraphs,
sharing our experiences directly on our portal....5th November is not
so far...:)
I remember all to be pragmatic and explain by examples. May be in this
period of time is useful to discuss what to write in every single
paragraph if someone has some doubts.

Thanks,
Mat

Hi all,

If it seems correct to you, I can take charge of the paragraph
"IMAP/SMTP Injection"

I have experience with the exploitation of this technique on different
webmails:
http://www.squirrelmail.org/security/issue/2006-02-15
http://hastymail.sourceforge.net/security.php
and others.


Regards,

Hi Mat,

Yes, I think that I can write the article for the 5th November.
I will use the template created for the chapter 4 (http: //
www.owasp.org/index.php/IMAP/SMTP_Injection_Testing_AoC).
Ok?

Regards,

Hi all,
Here is the Testing Guide status report of the 4th week:

 Week 04 - Oct 29
=============
* Now every contributor is writing his own article.
* There are already some small teams working together at the same article.
* A few contributors have added the articles on our Portal. If you
have any problem to write the article on the Wiki portal please
contact me.

Next:
====
* I remember you our deadline:  5th November to write the first draft
for the (we have only one week to finish our work).
* If you are writing an article with another contributor I suggest you
to contact him to share your informations and create a unique article
(if you have not the email please contact me).
* If you have any problem/suggestion about writing an article, please
feel free to contact me.

Progress State of each paragraph (on Wiki portal):
====================================
Note:
***  (0%,TD) means that none is writing this article
*** ( 50%, Alice ) means that Alice is writing this article and the
progress status is nearly 50%

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Vista EULA
Message-ID: <f3193c100610310540l427c2afeub1090dbae2614a57@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
theregister.co.uk has an article on the MS Vista EULA. It seems to have some
interesting points such as benchmarking and testing restrictions.
Restrictions on .NET testing which would make security research on Vista,
which is not inline with MS requirements, be a violation on the EULA.
Michael Howard, you did not mention this in Seattle. Is this meant to make
Vista more secure?

any thoughts?
Eoin

Subject: [Owasp-testing] New OWASP Testing guide: discussion about the Index

Yes, that's right Dinis.
But I've involved you because some changes have an impact on all the
OWASP Projects. I mean the problem to create a project that doesn't
overlap with the other ones.

I think that the Testing methodologies are:
Manual Inspection & Review
Threat Modeling
Code Review
Penetration Testing

I think that we have to write a chapter about that and create a link
with the other OWASP projects. In this chapter we can compare the
different methologies and talk about positive and negative issues.
After this we focus only about Penetration Testing otherwise we'll
make an overlap with the other projects and go outside the scope of
the Guide.
I think we can use a kind of threat modeling to create a framework to
evaluate the real risk after finding the technical vulnerabilities.

Rogan prototyped a Wiki2PDF solution for OWASP and it was pretty much
working.  It's not the prettiest in the world, but it did work.

Rogan, what's the status of that thing?

Yes, that's right Dinis.
But I've involved you because some changes have an impact on all the
OWASP Projects. I mean the problem to create a project that doesn't
overlap with the other ones.

I think that the Testing methodologies are:
Manual Inspection & Review
Threat Modeling
Code Review
Penetration Testing

I think that we have to write a chapter about that and create a link
with the other OWASP projects. In this chapter we can compare the
different methologies and talk about positive and negative issues.
After this we focus only about Penetration Testing otherwise we'll
make an overlap with the other projects and go outside the scope of
the Guide.
I think we can use a kind of threat modeling to create a framework to
evaluate the real risk after finding the technical vulnerabilities.

Hi all,
What do you think about the new Index?
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents

1) Look at the doc "OWASPTesting_PhaseOne"
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=62285)
IMHO I think we have to insert the Chaper 2" Principle of testing" ,
Chapter 3 "Testing techniques explained" and "The OWASP Testing
Framework" as first chapter of this guide.

2) I'd like to rename Chapter 4 from "Manual testing techniques" to
"Web Application Penetration Testing".

3) In accordance with Alberto Revelli, we think to create a new
template for Chapter 4:
1 Short Description of the Issue
2 How to Test
    2.1 Black Box testing and example
    2.2 White Box testing and example
3 References
    Whitepapers
    Tools
What do you think about that? More, may be we have to rename White Box
in Gray box, so it is clear the difference between penetration testing
(Black and Gray Box) and Code Review (White Box) that is a different
OWASP Project.

What are your feed back?
Thanks,
Mat

Hi,

Sounds very promising but take into account that the Autumn of Code project
is of a finite time.

It is important to consider:

In order to re-write all the chapters AND add the required new content shall
take some time. The completion date is the 31st December 2006 which gives us
about 11 weeks, not much time from my experience of developing the existing
Testing guide.

It would be better not to take too much on and miss the completion date. The
guide shall be ever evolving and the aim of this AoC project is to
consolidate the existing guide and NOT to perform a complete rewrite.

So my concern is the amount of time we have to complete this project Vs the
ever expanding scope of work.

regards,

Eoin,
OWASP Testing Guide Lead and coordinator.

Hi,

I think that the new index is good but the Phase 4 (During development) is
useless in this testing guide (I think).
How do you feel about this?

Bye bye
Carlo

Hi,
If you fee that we could "Push" any of the sections into the code review
guide or the Development guide please suggest.

Hi all,

I believe that we might use the already existing work realized in other
projects (as the Threat Classification, WASC). Of this way, we might
include the above mentioned threats and, in addition, to use a standard
terminology.

The problem is that we do not have too much time, so I propose the
following changes:

In the section "4.3 Business logic testing", I would add:
- Abuse of Functionality
- Insufficient Process Validation

In the section "4.6 Data Validation Testing", I would classify XSS's
attacks:
- Stored
- Reflected

I would create a new point "4.6.3 Command Execution" that would include
the following ones:
- ORM Injection
- LDAP Injection
- XML Injection
- SSI Injection
- XPath Injection
- SQL Injection
- IMAP/SMTP Injection
- Code Injection
- OS Commanding 

In the section "4.8 Infrastructure and configuration Testing" I would
create a point:
- Information disclosure
about this aspects:
- Directory indexing
- Information leakage
- Path Traversal
- Predictable Resource Location


What does seem to you?

Regards,
-- Vicente Aguilera

		Hi everyone,

I am new to the testing list, so please forgive my presumptuousness, but I think 3.4 Phase 3 absolutely needs to be here.  Moreover,  I believe UNIT TESTING needs to be added to 3.4 Phase 3.  In my opinion, it would be a mistake to *not* include a section for testing during development.  There are several tools for this, JUNIT, NUNIT, FxCOP that can be used to check for function bounds and any security rules.

Regards,

Mark

Sounds very promising but take into account that the Autumn of Code project is of a finite time.

It is important to consider:

In order to re-write all the chapters AND add the required new content shall take some time. The completion date is the 31st December 2006 which gives us about 11 weeks, not much time from my experience of developing the existing Testing guide. 

It would be better not to take too much on and miss the completion date. The guide shall be ever evolving and the aim of this AoC project is to consolidate the existing guide and NOT to perform a complete rewrite. 

So my concern is the amount of time we have to complete this project Vs the ever expanding scope of work.

Yes, I'd like to use the same vision of the OWASP Guide, so we can use
the same terminology and same approch of writing. Answers in line.

Thanks,
Mat

Yes you are right: but you can discuss these items inside the
paragraph 4.3. Otherwise the index become too much longer.
May you look at this paragraph as template?

Right, but the same said above

Ok, perfect. That is the right direction

I agree, may be a sub-paragraph "Information disclosure" is fine.

Hi Mark,

I wrote a paper and a presentation on this very topic for the past  
OWASP EU conference:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ 
Image:AutomatedSecurityTestingofWebApplications-StephendeVries.pdf

Some of the main points:
- Security testing is not that different from other software testing
- Security testing can easily be integrated into unit testing,  
integration testing and functional testing phases
- There are a wealth of tools available for unit testing that can be  
used for security testing, such as the unit testing frameworks,  
apache cactus, htmlunit, httpunit, WATIR (for ruby), and more.

I'd be glad to rework some of the material to fit into the guide, if  
you decide it's appropriate.

regards,
Stephen

Steve - 

Great - I'll take a look at your presentation later today.  Your points are
correct.  I've trained several teams of devs and fought battles with project
managers to get security design and testing (unit and functional) and so far
have had no major security breaches with those teams (yet).  I don't think
this stuff though has made it the general development population at large.
They know to validate input - but not exactly why or what damage incorrectly
validated input causes.

Regards,

Mark

Some of the tools, particularly the functional testing tools, could  
be of a lot of use to penetration testers too.
For example, the WATIR tool (http://wtr.rubyforge.org/) provides a  
ruby interface to IE, so you can control an instance of IE from a  
script.
Here's an example of a simple test using WATIR that performs 2 SQL  
injection tests in a login form:

require 'unittests/setup'
require 'watir'

$APP_HOME = 'http://localhost:8080/ispatula'
$USERNAME = 'corsaire1'
$PASSWORD = 'corsaire1'
$SQL_CONCAT_USERNAME = 'corsaire\'+\'1'

class SQL_Injection_Test < Test::Unit::TestCase
     include Watir

     def test_SQL_Blind_Injection()
         $ie.goto($APP_HOME)
         $ie.link(:url, /signonForm.do/).click
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set($USERNAME+'\' OR 1=1--')
         $ie.form(:action, "/ispatula/shop/signon.do").submit
         assert($ie.contains_text('Signon failed'));
     end

     def test_SQL_Injection_String_Concat()
         $ie.goto($APP_HOME)
         $ie.link(:url, /signonForm.do/).click
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set($SQL_CONCAT_USERNAME)
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'password').set($PASSWORD)
         $ie.form(:action, "/ispatula/shop/signon.do").submit
         assert($ie.contains_text('Signon failed'));
     end
end

HtmlUnit, Httpunit, jWebUnit and others provide similar functionality  
by using their own HTTP client rather than IE.
I think these could very powerful tools in a security tester's hands,  
and since they're quite intuitive to use you don't really need a  
strong programming background.

regards,
Stephen

Both Compuware TestPartner and VS.NET 2005 have a "recording" tool to
actually record the tests to C# code and can target many different browsers
(I'm sure there are others out there).  I've used the output of these as a
final run in a continuous integration environment that automatically builds
and tests nightly.

Some of the tools, particularly the functional testing tools, could be of a
lot of use to penetration testers too.
For example, the WATIR tool (http://wtr.rubyforge.org/) provides a ruby
interface to IE, so you can control an instance of IE from a script.
Here's an example of a simple test using WATIR that performs 2 SQL injection
tests in a login form:

require 'unittests/setup'
require 'watir'

$APP_HOME = 'http://localhost:8080/ispatula'
$USERNAME = 'corsaire1'
$PASSWORD = 'corsaire1'
$SQL_CONCAT_USERNAME = 'corsaire\'+\'1'

class SQL_Injection_Test < Test::Unit::TestCase
     include Watir

     def test_SQL_Blind_Injection()
         $ie.goto($APP_HOME)
         $ie.link(:url, /signonForm.do/).click
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set($USERNAME+'\' OR 1=1--')
         $ie.form(:action, "/ispatula/shop/signon.do").submit
         assert($ie.contains_text('Signon failed'));
     end

     def test_SQL_Injection_String_Concat()
         $ie.goto($APP_HOME)
         $ie.link(:url, /signonForm.do/).click
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'username').set($SQL_CONCAT_USERNAME)
         $ie.text_field(:name, 'password').set($PASSWORD)
         $ie.form(:action, "/ispatula/shop/signon.do").submit
         assert($ie.contains_text('Signon failed'));
     end
end

HtmlUnit, Httpunit, jWebUnit and others provide similar functionality by
using their own HTTP client rather than IE.
I think these could very powerful tools in a security tester's hands, and
since they're quite intuitive to use you don't really need a strong
programming background.

regards,
Stephen

Hi all,
Some questions & thought about the new index:

where would you think we should introduce 
HTTP {request,response}  {splitting,smuggling} in the index?
Maybe it could be on a new sub-paragraph in 4.6 Data Validation Testing
as HTTP Headers Injection, or should it be described in 4.6.1.3 HTTP
Methods + XSS ?

Moreover what about WEBDAV? Maybe this one could be inserted in this
latter par. 4.6.1.3 HTTP Methods. Or into '4.8 Infrastructure and
configuration Testing'?

What about Session fixation? Of course we should introduce it in 4.5
Session Management Testing, maybe in 4.5.1 Cookie and Session token
Manipulation(reg, forg/brute force).

Then about XSS let's remember about DOM Injection as XSS of third kind
(i agree it should be described directly in  4.6.1 Cross site
scripting).

Some other attacks that comes in my mind:
DNS Pinning 
Domain Contamination
..or maybe these are a kind of 'off topic' in the guide...

Another thought about classification which is maybe a little generic
but... what about creating two big categories like 'Client side' and
'server side' or it's better to categorize as attacks types and not as
attack targets..

Yes I know..too much questions but it's brainstorming, right? :)

Regards 
Stefano

I agree with Carlo, "3.4 Phase 3" overlap whit "Code review project" IMHO.

Ok, security code review is fundamental, but there is a completely 
different project for that, it is useless to overlap the two project.
We can link the section with the Code review projects.

One thing again, I think we can avoid to rename White box in Gray box, 
because the "Phase 2" is about white box and not gray box methodology.

that describes the testing methodologies that are better suited for each
step of the development cycle. The goal is to help the reader to
understand when to use each method (Risk Analysis, Threat Modeling,
Penetration Testing, Code Review, ...)
It does not get into any detailed description (Chapter 4 will do that,
and only for penetration testing). As long as we limit ourselves to a
short paragraph about what Code Review is and when it is to be used, and
provide a link to the corresponding OWASP project, we do not risk any
overlapping.

We have to define exactly what we mean with "gray box" and "white box".
To me, "gray box" is when we have some sort of initial information to
start with (e.g.: web server vendor and version, algorithm used to
generate a cookie, ...), as opposed to "black box" testing, in which we
start with no information at all.
When I think about "white box", I imagine a situation in which I have
*all* the information about the application, source code included.
Therefore, I think that the "white box" expression should indicate an
approach based on Code Review.

Hi,

Great progress everyone.  I'd really like to see references to articles
already at OWASP about the various attacks and vulnerabilities you're
testing for.  Check the Honeycomb project for lots of these.  This will
help to reduce overlap and redundancy.

1: totally agree, so many people today still dont understand the  
voodoo we do.

2: again great idea

3: Always been a tricky section and its why we initially have grey/ 
black and white. In reality you get white or black (i consider grey  
to be more of a marketing term than anything else)

Eoin: If you think about it many many things could go into the DV section.
It would be best to  put it in a HTTP section.

Eoin: WEBDAV, I would say this would also go under HTTP as it is HTTP 
extensions.

Eoin: Keep Session fixation in session mgt. when doc is done depending on 
the flow we may move it.

Eoin: Agreed, keep all the XSS together. It shall be easier to find this 
way. We should think about the book as a reference.

Eoin: A Little off topic but if required in an explanation refer to the

Hi,

Question:
Do we want to get into Unit Testing and SDLC methodology in this guide?
I thought they would be more suite to Andrews dev guide or the code review 
project.
unit testing is related to testing small blocks of a syaytem individually 
and hence a development phase done prior to system and integration testing.
The Guide currently focuses on penetration testing which is "After the Fact" 
testing and not really one until the system in developed.

What y'all think?

Eoin

Agreed.

Apart from the review of a more general framework in Chapter 3, I
believe the guide should remain focused of pure penetration testing and
leave everything that is related to the development phases to the
projects you mentioned

Hi all,

my first post and 2 cents here:

I guess we should make a difference between the techniques of unit
testing and the results of UT. Even if UT can be used to... e.g.,
discover BO or SQL-injection vulns.

Although, I noticed that there is an Appendix for fuzzing which is
another technique for discovering (some) vulnerabilities.


A new question: imagine the following situation: The pen tester
discovers a SQL-injection vulnerability in a webapp he is auditing. This
vuln. allows him to store some javascript in the Db and therefore
perpetrate a XSS attack (incubated) on the users of this webapp.  My
question is where do we describe this attacks? (I think they are
important enough to be included somewhere.)

Cheers,
Ariel

Eoin,

I think you are correct, now that I reread the purpose of the document.

Here's my thoughts:

Thinking in terms of pen testing - we probably should look at the OSSTMM or
NIST guidelines for a framework for pen testing (the sections in question are
under the OWASP Testing Framework).

Basically this is the NIST framework (it's short and sweet -
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-42/NIST-SP800-42.pdf section
3.10 can be adapted from Network to Website):  

1. Planning - what is the purpose of the attack, what resources do I need, is
it black, white or grey, do I have a get out of jail free card. 

2. Discovery - Server identification, technology and version, available
exploits, research without "breaking and entering"

3. Attack - Self explanatory

And

4. Reporting - for each stage, the pen tester needs to provide a report of the
phase - Planning - have all your docs good to go.  Discover - document your
findings.  Attack - summarize the attack - use indicators for High, Medium, Low
Risk for each test item.

If we incorporate these into the document, then we can attribute NIST and
OSSTMM (is there a EU framework? Does BS7799 have anything like that?)

Let me know what you guys think,

Mark

Hi,

Question:
Do we want to get into Unit Testing and SDLC methodology in this guide?
I thought they would be more suite to Andrews dev guide or the code review 
project.
unit testing is related to testing small blocks of a syaytem individually 
and hence a development phase done prior to system and integration testing.
The Guide currently focuses on penetration testing which is "After the Fact" 
testing and not really one until the system in developed.

What y'all think?

Eoin

In terms of a purely Penetration testing framework viewpoint -

Unit Testing can be very useful in the Discovery phase (Plan, Discover, Attack,
Report) - I can use a tool like JAD, .NET Reflector, et al to decompile a web
app - function by function.  Then using JUNIT or NUNIT or any other testing
suite, automate the unit test per function and fuzz for vulnerabilities.  That,
to me, is an appropriate penetration testing exercise.

About hybrid attacks,  I've heard of contests where the cracker who used the
most types of attacks won.  For example, here's a bunch of different attacks in
a session:  breach a firewall, arp poison a router, buffer overflow a server,
rootkit the server, sniff the network, steal userids and passwords, send
e-mails from within the mail network, and on and on.  It's the antithesis to
risk analysis and layering defense ;)  It would be helpful to identify patterns
- not sure if I've seen any public work on Web attack patterns.

Hi all,

my first post and 2 cents here:

I guess we should make a difference between the techniques of unit
testing and the results of UT. Even if UT can be used to... e.g.,
discover BO or SQL-injection vulns.

Although, I noticed that there is an Appendix for fuzzing which is
another technique for discovering (some) vulnerabilities.


A new question: imagine the following situation: The pen tester
discovers a SQL-injection vulnerability in a webapp he is auditing. This
vuln. allows him to store some javascript in the Db and therefore
perpetrate a XSS attack (incubated) on the users of this webapp.  My
question is where do we describe this attacks? (I think they are
important enough to be included somewhere.)

Cheers,
Ariel

Hi,
incubated attacks are important enough to warrant a section under XSS. It is
another varient of XSS.
Metteo what do you think?

4.4.5 Phising attacks / two facto authentication testing
4.4.6 Encrypted password strength testing
4.4.7 CAPTCHA strength

Should we inculde these under section 4? 

Phising attacks success rate depend on the authentication mechanism (For
eg,.Two facto may be little diff than single password), should we inclue
something for two facto authentication test?

Aplogies if I hv suggested anything irrelevent.

Hi,

Great progress everyone.  I'd really like to see references to articles
already at OWASP about the various attacks and vulnerabilities you're
testing for.  Check the Honeycomb project for lots of these.  This will
help to reduce overlap and redundancy.

look at:
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents)
4.6 Data Validation Testing 0% TD
4.6.1 Cross site scripting 0% TD
4.6.1.1 Incubated attacks 0% TD

Ariel may be says that Incubated attacks are a combination of SQL Inj
and XSS, but we can reasonably affirm that is a particular XSS attack.
In the same paragraph we can show an example that how a XSS Inc Attack
works exploiting an SQL Inj vulnerability.
Right?

The whole bag of fun that is XSS needs to be thought about in a clear  
manner.
Are we going to talk about ever possible xss mutation, such as:

Basic
HTML element
Character Encoding
Embedded Character
Event handlers
HTML Quote Encapsulation
URL obfuscation

Or are we going to concentrate on the basics?

Yes, that's the focal point of the project.
As Eoin sayd, we have a finite time (31th dec for a complete guide).
The fact is that today we have written nearly nothing about XSS and
many other items.

So the idea is:
- 5th November: 1st dead line to cover the basic and create link to whitepapers
- Then review all, finish the par. not yet completed
- Then if we have time, we can go in details on each par.

That make sense?

Guys,

when doing these articles can we ensure that the articles are practical and
pragmatic?
I.e. Examples of the test discussed and less academic theory.
Just that, there are many books out there on the "theory" but what we need
is examples of "how to test"..

What do y'all think?

Yep,
Eoin is right. We don't need to write down all the theory about a
particular attack, but just a brief description. The added value of
this guide is our experience on how to test. Focus on real
case-studies will be great. IMHO this concept has to be our guideline
in writing new articles.
Other feed back?

examples are good. Ideally they should give an introduction of what  
the tester is testing for, a brief explanation and the actual method  
used to test and desired output


=======================================================
Topic:

XSS IFRAME Test

Explanation:

HTML frames allow authors to present documents in multiple views,  
which may be independent windows or subwindows. These are commonly  
found to be vulnerable, and if the web application allows iframes,  
there could be further XSS vulnerabilities present

Testing for IFRAME vulnerabilities:
Using a proxy, recreate the IFRAME code with following code
<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert(;'OWASP IFRAME XSS Test');"></IFRAME>

Result Expected:
A alert box with the caption "OWASP IFRAME XSS Test" should appear

=======================================================

That makes lots of sense.  You can link to the "Attack" or
"Vulnerability" category articles on the subject which will have the
full background.

Daniel and all,
this is the right direction IMHO, too.

as Matteo  pointed in his first mail:
_snip_
" ....
3) In accordance with Alberto Revelli, we think to create a new
template for Chapter 4:
1 Short Description of the Issue
2 How to Test
    2.1 Black Box testing and example
    2.2 White Box testing and example
3 References
    Whitepapers
    Tools 
...."
_snip_

Apart from 2.2, which maybe could be redirected to code review, it seems
to me the same practical approach.

I agree that a very light and pragmatic reference guide with links to
attack theory and tools is what we need.


Very good idea for 'Result Expected:' !

Maybe some antifiltering/metachars attack related list or reference
( where a list would be too long ) could be useful as a sub paragraf of
the attack technique.

IMHO, of course...

You are right. It is a simple XSS incubated attack.

But on the other hand, now that I continue to think about it... What
about using a SQL-injection vulnerability to upload code to the Db, next
if the server has shell enabled this can be used to execute this code?
(I Googled an example of sth like this for attacking PHP's PMA that I
copy below.)

The point is that if the pentester discovers a SQL-injection, he might
be able to do a lot of things. It appears that the SQL-injection gives
the pentester a new /asset/ (the ability to make certain queries to
certain tables in the Db). After it, with all the information he has
gathered so far, the pen tester will decide what to do. Probably, he
will want to research the implications of the SQL-injection
vulnerability. Collegue Gerardo Richarte has proposed this methodology
(see, e.g., slides form his PacSec Japan 2003 talk) over the traditional
(IG, Attack, Pentrate and report) approach.

Moreover, sometimes during a pen test it isn't just enough to discover a
SQL-injection. You need to prove the impact of this vulnerability to
developers that think it is inofensive and shouldn't be fixed.

Then my question is: should we include a prelude on pen testing
methodology before 4.1? Then, in accordance with Matt's suggestion,
should each section (e.g., XSS incubated attacks) include a subsection
where all the attacks assume that condition X holds (where X is some
sort of SQL-injection vulnerability was found, or such permissions are
badly set, et cetera)? I think this might be beneficial to the readers.

sure,
but we can not take into account every variant of attack for each
vulnerability discovered.
If one discovers SQL injection it is up to them to use a little skill in
order to exploit this vulnerability.
Also all systems are different so the list of variants  would be endless.
I believe we need to take a "middle" approach here and show how to do stuff
or disover vulnerabilities but exploitation it the area that takes some
skill and also alot of trial and error.
Documenting all the "vectors" of attack would increase the workload of the
project and we only have until December.
but it is a good idea never-the-less.

Just a couple of things that come to my mind (thanks to Matteo and
Alberto)...

Data Validation Testing chapter misses a little par. about 
directory traversal/local file include and remote file include.

Another point is about athentication and authorization chapter, on pages
which miss to exit on a redirection when they find the login/passwd are
wrong. 
An example below in Php:
<?
if(islogged())
header("Location : redir.php")
// without exit and then login page follows
logged-in code..-.
?>

Maybe in this cases a paragraph is worth writing to cover the issue and
to point out the use of command line raw requests like curl and related.

Cool brainstorming!
Here my idea:

why not choose a common and, if possible, fixed template for every
paragraph, so as to increase readablenes: this is a test guide, not
the encyclopedia of web applications attacks but noteven a simple
checklist...

Without common template does not exist an paragraph similar to an other

My (poor) example for paragraph template:

attack theory and requirements
code
practical examples
attended issue
impact
countermeasures
tips
other attacks correlation (a clew between attacks)
reference
tools

etc etc

Feel free to add or delete items

Matteo

Hi Matteo,
in our last discussions we have defined a template like that:

* Short Description of the Issue (Topic and Explanation)
* Black Box testing and example
   - Testing for Topic X vulnerabilities:
   - Result Expected:
* Gray Box testing and example (if any)
   - Testing for Topic X vulnerabilities:
   - Result Expected:
* References
   - Whitepapers
   - Tools

Dan, I've merged the old teplate with your idea...does it works for you?
Any other suggestions/comments

Thanks,
Mat

Perfect.
Thank you Stefano, I've added:
4.4.4 Directory traversal/file include

What about your second idea...where can we insert this item?

I've talked about "4.2 Information Gathering" and "4.8 Infrastructure
and configuration Testing" with Carlo and Stefano.
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents)

May be we can merge these like that (deleting par.4.8):

4.2 Information Gathering
4.2.1 Spidering and googling
4.2.2 Analisys of error code
4.2.3 Infrastructure configuration management testing
SSL/TLS Testing
4.2.4 Application configuration management testing
File extensions handling
Old, backup and unreferenced files

What is your opinion?
Mat

Hi,
After a long brainstorming with Stefano, our idea is to change Data
Validation paragraph as follow:
DATA VALIDATION

4.6.1 Cross site scripting 0% TD
4.6.1.1 HTTP Methods and XST 0% TD
//(Phishing +XSS is not a test, but a particular attack. So we can
describe it like an //example in 4.6.1)

//(more rational par about SQL Injection)
4.6.2 SQL Injection 0% TD
4.6.2.1 Stored procedure injection 0% TD
4.6.2.2 Oracle testing,
4.6.2.3 MySQL testing,
4.6.2.4 SQL Server testing
// 4.6.2.4 Listener Testing - is an infrastructural testing

//(a par. for every different test)
4.6.3 ORM Injection
4.6.4 LDAP Injection
4.6.5 XML Injection,
4.6.6 SSI Injection,
4.6.7 XPath Injection
4.6.8 IMAP/SMTP Injection
4.6.9 Code Injection
4.6.10 OS Commanding

4.6.11 Buffer overflow Testing
4.6.11.1 Heap overflow
4.6.11.2 Stack overflow
4.6.11.3 Format string

4.6.12 Incubated vulnerability testing
//(we see this like an advanced testing that exploits multiple vulnerabilities)

What do you think about that?

Thanks again Stefano.
Mat

MediaWiki should be fine - I use Safari as my primary browser, and  
haven't noticed too many problems.

thanks,

Subject: [Owasp-testing] WARNING: Dummies & Managers Ahead (aka my 2 cents
	for you...)
Message-ID: <55a185190610180055g28d56c14hc35a7fb77c9ea34@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

PREAMBLE: this mail was meant to be a couple lines long but went out
of my hand... If you have only a minute or so go to <PROPOSAL> section
directly...

<WHOAMI>

My name is Matteo Flora and I'm very pleased to meet you all... I met
Matt and Alberto here in Italy and they told me to sign on to the ML
and take a look at the document...

Well, it surely is something worth looking at!

Just my passing 2 cents: I'm basically a "political" sort of guy,
directing Italian Privacy and Security Observatory (OPSI) and with a
leading role in Italian Computer Society (AIP)...
I struggle everyday to take some kind of awareness in Corporate and
Gov, with direct connection with Italian (and to minimum degree
European) institutes for adoption of Sec methodologies.

But I'm not here to talk about me ;)

<THEPROBLEM>

I was pointing to Matt and Alberto that the actual document is a
perfect example of what a methodology should be and I scarcely am able
to think to anything that isn't covered in there (while I confess huge
gaps in methodologies I didn't even know the name of!).
Working with management (ISO27001) I often am able to see at the
adoption route of a methodology over another and I have a couple of
observation to share with you (each of them not worth more than my 2
eurocents)....

We're facing a couple  problems:

1) Pentester aren't uniformly  SMART
While we're here and we know what to do and how (well, at least YOU
DO) many pentesters or wannabe in the world don't know much about
in-depth methodologies and so on. Many of them simply rely on
off-the-shelf tools and off-the-shelf methodologies and even if these
are NOT what PT should be we must be aware of their existence.

2) Managers tend to screen methodologies
IT world has changed in the last few years even on the side of
management: typical European manager (or PM) is nowaday a hybrid
figure closer than before to code and developing. He tends to look
deeply at methodologies and being security the "buzz of these years"
each manager tend to spot his competence in this field.

How does this affect us at all?

Well, nowadays we see a plethora of new certifications, methodologies,
tools, codes, guidelines, best practices and so on scattered around
and each of them is used or not based on two factors: political power
of the solution (i.e. ISO) and ease of adoption.

While we cannot impact (right now) on the "political power" of OWASP
we can impact deeply on the ease of use. If people are able to use our
document they'll gladly adopt it.

BUT (there's always a BUT.... Murphy thing, you understand...)

It is my opinion that the actual structure of the document will
represent a very though and steep entry-level to a poorly skilled
pentester and/or to a manager.
Let me clear up: that's not necessarily a PROBLEM... We could happily
say "f*ck the dummies, this is a pro document", but I think we'll
loose 80% of possible audience. In addition to this let's remember
that the TESTING document is in many cases far more important than
Coding Guidelines! Why's that? It's simple: reviewing and testing an
application if far easier than building a perfect one and even if a
manager isn't maybe able to review the code he can look at injections
and hijacking quite easily....

<PROPOSAL>

I propose to prepend EACH technique (all the 4.x.x paragraph) with a
"for dummies" paragraph meant to be read by people that don't know
about the problem and giving a little insight on the subject from a
NON TECH view. LANGUAGE will be different, avoiding techie slang and
FORM would be different, outlining concepts instead of points....
I DO NOT suggest a "for dummy" title, but something like "Overview"
and "Technology" division....

Let's take a look to an example:

e.g. "Being able to tamper with cookies may result in hijacking the
sessions of legitimate users"

Will become:

"Manipulating the cookie content may result, and often results, in
changing the environment and may lead to simulate another user or to
gain unauthorized privileges or access"

The aim is to let a TOTAL IDIOT (like me =]) understand what we're
talking about without falling into technical speech too much and
without letting the subject to frighten a reader.
In addition to this not anyone is prepared to cope with every subject
and more often than not I'm sure that people will thank us for that
and our introduction will explain them what to read and how to
document on a peculiar subject...

I'll be able (as an ignorant) to take a look at most of the subjects
and to write briefings but what I'd really like is to know what do you
all think about this approach...

Matt gave me an overenthusiastic feedback, but we all know Matt ;)

Ok, sorry to have wasted so much of your time and let me know if I've
been not clear...


Ciao!

I think this is an excellent idea. I've found that while the "dummies"
don't generally care too much exactly how a vulnerability works, they
are quite interested in the attack scenario and the impact.  It's
difficult to write these sections clearly, so it would be nice to have a
sort of formula for this section -- something like...

"This [vulnerability] would allow a [threat agent] could [do something
technical], enabling them to cause [system impact]. For many
applications this vulnerability could cause [business impact]."

So, for example, your example would be something like...

"This weak session cookie vulnerability would allow an anonymous
internet user to forge cookie-style authentication credentials, enabling
them to access the accounts of legitimate users. For many applications,
this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access users' personal
information, resulting in serious confidentiality, privacy, and
integrity problems as well as reputation damage."

The idea sounds very good to me, and would increase the number of our
potential readers.

What we can do is to add a "summary" or "abstract" to the beginning of
each topic.
The summary must not be longer than 50/60 words, and must clearly answer
the following two questions:

1. What kind of vulnerability are we testing ?
2. What are the risks posed by such a vulnerability ?

The second point is very important, as it would provide a non-technical
reader (read: a suit) a quick understanding of the danger, and it would
make the guide a good reference point also from a risk assessment
perspective.

As a further example, here's how I'd write a summary for "googling":

==SUMMARY==
This test checks whether queries to search engines can provide
information that is not supposed to be public.
The impact of the vulnerability is the disclosure of
proprietary/confidential information.

Great idea, though i'd like us to not use the dummy connotation :0)

The biggest issue i've seen recently is the lack of testing  
experience with todays batch of pentesters. Maybe it's me being a old  
fart, but i feel todays testers dont have the background knowledge  
and act using the HackingExposed (tm) methodology.

Matteo, your idea is brilliant and one that needs to be included

I like the idea.  A second, almost as important function IMHO, would be to
standardize our classification.  I think it would be useful for our
community to standardize what we communicate to our sponsors (managers,
clients, etc.).  How does the open source community define a Web Service -
XML Structural attack?  We would be somewhat creating an pentesting
"industry-accepted" definition in "management" speak.

Perfect.
So I'll update the template for the paragraphs in Chapter 4 including
"In brief" or "Summary" at the top.

Mark, I think we have to update the optimum doc Checklist v1.1 with
the list of test we decribe (looking also at HoneyComb project as Jeff
said), and include it at the top of Chapter 4 (Web App Pen Testing).
Then make a link with Chapter 5 in wich we describe a methology to
value the REAL risk of the vulnerabilities founded: also in this
chapter we can make the difference from a management point of view
because we'll show numbers ! ;)

Subject: [Owasp-testing] off topic? Web application discovery
Message-ID: <453638f1.1cb93d8c.05a4.ffffe814@mx.google.com>

Don't know if you agree to include the following stuff in the testing guide
or not... I'd say it fits into 4.2.x

 

The following considerations apply to black box testing.

 

With the proliferation of virtual web servers, the traditional 1:1-type
relationship between an IP address and a web server is loosing much of its
original significance. It is not uncommon to have multiple web sites /
applications whose symbolic names resolve to the same IP (and this scenario
is not limited to hosting environments, but applies to ordinary corporate
environments as well).

Sometimes you are given a bunch of IP addresses (maybe just one...) to test.
No other knowledge. You may argue this is more of a pentest-type engagement,
but in my experience it is not that infrequent, and if you stumble on a
webapp, you test it, right? Problem is, the IP address they gave you hosts
an http service on port 80, but if you access it specifying the IP address
(which is all you know) it reports "No web server configured at this
address" or a similar message. But that box could "hide" a bunch of webapps,
associated to unrelated symbolic (DNS) names. Obviously the extent of your
analysis is deeply affected by the fact that you test the applications, or
you do not - because you don't notice them, or you notice only SOME of them.

Again, in my experience sometimes clients refuse to give more information in
addition to IP addresses, or they provide incomplete name lists (!) so it is
worth to do a discovery.

 

Determining black-box which virtual servers reside on the same IP is not a
trivial task, and in general has not a complete solution.

I have compiled a list of services on the web which may be used to help into
this sort of reverse queries (some of them do DNS name searching, which is
equally important: given a domain name, find which symbolic names are
defined - in absence of zone transfers, obviously). Of course contributions
are welcome. These services tend to return different results (because are
often partial results), so it's better to try many of them for "better
coverage".

 

netcraft search DNS: http://searchdns.netcraft.com/?host

Domain tools reverse IP: http://www.domaintools.com/reverse-ip/ (requires
free membership)

msn search: search.msn.com, syntax: "ip:x.x.x.x" (without the quotes)

webhosting info: http://whois.webhosting.info/,
http://whois.webhosting.info/x.x.x.x (reverse IP)

DNSstuff: http://www.dnsstuff.com/ (multiple services)

http://net-square.com/msnpawn/index.shtml (multiple queries on domains and
IP addresses, must be installed)

tomDNS: http://www.tomdns.net/ (some services still private)

SEOlogs.com http://www.seologs.com/ip-domains.html (reverse ip/domain
lookup)

 

 

To sum it up: Technically it's not web app assessment, but often may be a
prerequisite. In my opinion, it naturally fits into the Information
Gathering phase.

 

cheers,

 

Mauro

That's fine.
We can add a new "4.2.1 Application Discovery"...before spindering and googling.
What do you think?

Hi, Matteo, Eoin Here.
If one needs theory it can be found in other sections of the OWASP site.
One issue the OWASP leaders have defined is that the we do not required
overlap in the site.

If one needs to understand the issue from a technology perspective it can be
found elsewhere in the site.

I think the  agreement already is to stick to the "how to test" information
and leave the theory and background other section of the site which already
exist.

Hope this explains it,

Eoin

HI Matteo,
If the majority of the team wish to add the "idiots guide" (this makes me
smile), then so be it, cool.

I think we should be carefull that we dont reinvent  the wheel or repeat
definitions that we already have on the site. We can simply add a URL to a
section on the OWASP site to the same information.?

Matteo (Meucci), as technical AoC lead, its your call, if thats  ok with
everyone?

Eoin

I don't want to prolong this anymore, but I'd recommend that we enforce that
it be a very brief description (I'd say a bullet item - powerpoint stuff).
You'll lose the reader if he/she's an idiot anyway ;)

HI Matteo,

If the majority of the team wish to add the "idiots guide" (this makes me
smile), then so be it, cool.

 

I think we should be carefull that we dont reinvent  the wheel or repeat
definitions that we already have on the site. We can simply add a URL to a
section on the OWASP site to the same information.?

 

Matteo (Meucci), as technical AoC lead, its your call, if thats  ok with
everyone?

Hi Eoin and thanx for the answer,

sorry for being blunt, but I humbly think this way you'll just loose
80% of the audience. 
The world isnt' made by pentest-geniouses and while I don't suggest to
explain "what a cookie is" I strongly suggest to give the idiots a
chance...

"That's, of course, just my 2eurocents, but you can't suppose everyone 
will know everything and all the document risks to be setted in a
corner for reference only by managers. And this means it will be
setted in a corner by decision makers. And this means less and less
adoption... 

That's, of course, just my opinion having to handle to tenths of
organizations that choose ISO27001 over OSSTTMM for VA only because
thay understand the former and not the latter...

This said it's not a religious belief on my side and I may be (and 
probabily am) wrong...

Think about how many people know laws... And what's the problem of laws?

"The former article XXX of YYY is changed according to YYY and XXX
while articole WWW will modify TTT to be real at EEE on ZZZ." 



My 2eurocents as always and I'll not pursue this more.

Hi all,

IMHO we should try to be concise with everything that is repeated
elsewhere and give pointers so that newbies can follow. On the other
hand, it is really a nuisance to follow eight links to read one article,
so there should be some tradeoff (which each contributor could manage
with out further explainations). :)

Cheers,
Ariel

Hey Seba,

Fine with me as long as we do not keep repeating ourselves throughout the
site.
It's Matteo's call.

Regarding the reporting stuff we also do some work with the metrics project.
Especially in the categorisation of severity and criticality context. ie.
"What is High severity, what is med, how do we define this as each project
is unique and vulns are context sensitive.

Nice one. Keep up all this good stuff and conversation. Things are really
shaping up well.
A real AoC success story, so far :0)
Eoin

Perfect...
ok,our world is open and democratic...so, I count more guys that are
pro the Matteo Flora idea. So we can add a very short "Summary" in
which we describe in "natural
language" what we want to do (very very short summary).

If we take a look at the table of Contents:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents
I think we have set up a great team...thanks all!

Now I suggest to begin using the power of Wiki and begin writing the paragraphs,
sharing our experiences directly on our portal....5th November is not
so far...:)
I remember all to be pragmatic and explain by examples. May be in this
period of time is useful to discuss what to write in every single
paragraph if someone has some doubts.

Thanks,
Mat

Hi all,

If it seems correct to you, I can take charge of the paragraph
"IMAP/SMTP Injection"

I have experience with the exploitation of this technique on different
webmails:
http://www.squirrelmail.org/security/issue/2006-02-15
http://hastymail.sourceforge.net/security.php
and others.

Hi Mat,

Yes, I think that I can write the article for the 5th November.
I will use the template created for the chapter 4 (http: //
www.owasp.org/index.php/IMAP/SMTP_Injection_Testing_AoC).
Ok?

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Vista EULA
Message-ID: <f3193c100610310540l427c2afeub1090dbae2614a57@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
theregister.co.uk has an article on the MS Vista EULA. It seems to have some
interesting points such as benchmarking and testing restrictions.
Restrictions on .NET testing which would make security research on Vista,
which is not inline with MS requirements, be a violation on the EULA.
Michael Howard, you did not mention this in Seattle. Is this meant to make
Vista more secure?

any thoughts?
Eoin
