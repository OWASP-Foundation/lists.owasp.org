Subject: [Owasp-testing] BlackHat - "Pulp Google Hacking:The Next Generation
 Search Engine Hacking Arsenal"
Message-ID: <CAFCvB5Kz+iZC18T_KY8G1b7SPZ9eqo=G_aOm2PaVcRW4Dug=Fg@mail.gmail.com>

Fran Brown and Rob Ragan are presenting tomorrow (3 August) at 4:45PM
at BlackHat i.e.
http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-11/bh-us-11-schedule.html

The major benefit of
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Search_engine_discovery/reconnaissance_(OWASP-IG-002)
over the GHDB is that the Search Results aren't limited to the false
positives from the GHDB, rather the OWASP alternative discovers all
possible technical vulnerabilities and information leakage, such as
information not intended to be made public by reversing the display
order of the search results. I also pioneered the use of Google Alerts
to automate this process i.e. mentioned ~40:55 within
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5419982525671711780.

Since I don't attend BlackHat or DefCon by I would appreciate it if
someone could attend their session and highlight the benefits of our
approach .

Hi all,

Just blogged about "Unusual Web Spidering Techniques" -
http://bit.ly/nAUf9X - I thought it would be useful to post the link
in this list, as it might give some ideas to improuve section
OWASP-IG-001 (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_%28OWASP-IG-001%29
) in the next OWASP Testing Guide v4.

Feedback, as usual, is more than welcome.

Cheers,

Roberto Suggi Liverani

Roberto,

The intent of when this was proposed was to separate the coupling of
"Spidering and Googling" in v2 i.e.
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2008-May/001462.html
as two parts for v3

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Identify_application_entry_points_(OWASP-IG-003)
might be more related to your proposal.

To build on this,
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Information_Gathering should
be reordered so that it reflects the actual order in which they are
performed e.g.:
1. DNS
2. nmap
3. httprint
4. robots.txt
5. search engine reconnaissance
6. spidering

Hi Christian,

Let's see how that goes when discussions will start on the
organisation of the index of the OWASP Testing Guide.

Meantime, I have got some feedback from different people and as a
consequence I have updated the article:

Roberto,

You need to replace your "reconnaissance phase" URL quoted on

from https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders,_Robots,_and_Crawlers_(OWASP-IG-001)

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Hydra - Brute Force HTTP Digest Authentication?
Message-ID: <CAKTkgaWsBx5tjGYyqDjfk4ufGrDz2-vjQqy_Hkght5uTA2T0Ww@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am experimenting doing brute force using Hydra[1]. I've tried brute
forcing HTTP basic authentication using Hydra and it was succeed. I
found OWASP Testing had mention about this[2] but unfortunately I
didn't found on how to brute force HTTP digest authentication.

Can Hydra do that?

Message-ID: <F6174A7FB2F28248B34B7F3024FF2E60025BA3E1F8@MBX12.bell.corp.bce.ca>

Seems the site is experiencing some issues this morning. What really caught my eye was the "... database server: Too many connections (127.0.0.1)" part. While the DB might not be exposed externally this is still contrary to what I believe most of us would suggest to our clients (i.e.: DB should not be the same machine as the WebServer. Due to single point of failure, etc.)

"OWASP has a problem

Sorry! This site is experiencing technical difficulties.
Try waiting a few minutes and reloading.

(Can't contact the database server: Too many connections (127.0.0.1))

You can try searching via Google in the meantime.
Note that their indexes of our content may be out of date."

You know, that 2 machines fail double the time of a single machine :) So
unless you have some kind of switch over its just more expensive :)

But maybe it is indeed a good idea to look at the OWASP Web Setting and
publish it, along with all the best practice documentations the
different OWASP Projects recommend.

On a slight tangent, the DB might be firewalled to only accept
connections from the localhost hence the attack surface would be the
same if it was moved to another host i.e. the pivot would still be the
web server.
