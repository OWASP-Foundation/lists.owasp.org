Larry,

thats cool, i also fell into that trap (damn this work thing..)
I have to admit, the level of final editing that was done on this doc was
bloody impressive (i'm hoping the 2nd phase will be like this)

A few (marginal) comments below.
Congrats for the good doc.

Mauro


- page 11, regarding the statement 
  'The primary issue with OCTAVE is its use of
likelihood = 1, or
  ?all risks are equally risky?', I believe it is not
entirely true;
  at least, OCTAVE-S (OCTAVE's tailored version for
  smaller enterprises) provides the means for
describing the likelihood of
  future occurrences of a threat (as well as recording
how often it occurred
  in the past), i.e. defining probabilities.
  If I remember correctly, in OCTAVE probabilities are
an optional feature.

- typo on page 12, should be "if you want to know
what?s really going on,
  go straight to the source? instead of "...to
straight to the source".
- typo on page 12, should be "or is supposed to be
happening" instead of
  ...suppose
- typo on page 12, should be "Can miss calls to issues
in compiled libraries"
  instead of "can missed..."
- typo on page 16, should be "as" instead of "aw"

- page 16 seems to be incomplete... (isn't it?

- page 26 Figure "Typical SDLC Testing Workflow".
Shouldn't it include
  (in the development, deployment sections)
  test activities to validate the artifact being built
against functional and
  non-functional requirements? (the real test cases...
including
  acceptance tests if needed after deployment)

it just shows that no matter how much you look at a doc, there are still
blatant errors which the human eye overlooks.

fixed the minor issues, still outstanding:

page 11: the OCTAVE...
page 16: true, not sure why it seems so short
page 26: it should, but why wasnt it?

Those are good, thanks (not sure why they never made it in to be honest)

Ideally i would _really_ like it if phase 1 could be released soon. There
has been a long period of nothing happening and now is the time for it's
release.

How many people, at the moment, have time to go through this version and
double check everything is ok?

Hi Daniel, attached are some of the improvements I suggested a while 
back since I have not seen them in the document, I'm not sure if they 
were not addressed because you believed them inappropiate or because I 
did not explain them properly. I've also added some more information 
to the Appendix section (tools and references) which might also be 
valuable.

Great stuff. 2 things.

1. Author credits - I know I took a list a while back but I lost it. If you
could mail Daniel your name with pointers to the sections you contributed to
(or reviewed) we can make sure everyone is credited where due.

2. Forewords - When we have a final draft, can you give me a week to collect
forewords from those suggested on page 2 ?

I was just in my fav bookstore and picked up a book called Software
Testing in the real world. 

Chapter 1 the Six essentials of software testing look pretty familiar to
OWASP Testing Part 1. It was refreshing to see statement like testing
should be carried out at ever stage of the development cycle from
requirements to deployment. I think we are spot on inline with the
development community for Testing Guide 1 despite the fact it may not be
inline with the popular security community (more pen tests please sir).

Anyways it's a really good read so far.

Hi All,

I gather we are still on track for those people who offered to do a final
review?
I will be in Russia from tomorrow till tuesday and would love it if we
could have a final final by the end of next week.

Any problems, let me know

I had some feedback from a SIT manager on a major project whilst at EDS
today on an earlier draft of part one. I'll try and get a copy in his
hands tomorrow.
