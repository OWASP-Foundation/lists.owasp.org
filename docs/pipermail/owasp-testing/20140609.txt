Brad,

Since your former member of the Global Project Committee it is well
known that you alone produced poor quality i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2013-December/001286.html
while lecturing other members of the OWASP community.

Maybe you should upgrade to ZAP and see if there is more low hanging
fruit within Lunker?

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Project Status Evaluation Criteria/Timeline ?
Message-ID: <F6174A7FB2F28248B34B7F3024FF2E600281F25A54@MBX12.bell.corp.bce.ca>

I'm resending this as part of a new/separate thread as the original in the testing list seems to have gone somewhat off the rails.

Has the review process or even a timeline been defined yet?

It seems kind of backward to demote projects without having prepared the process by which they will be re-promoted or re-assessed. Or even high level timeline? i.e.:
May - Projects Demoted.
June - Announce demotions and reasoning.
July - Announce review process/criteria.
Aug - Project members/leaders submit info/details, complete forms, whatever...
Sept - Board reviews.
Oct - Project status reset.
At least publishing something like that would give the community some sense of "Ok things are moving/changing, and I have an idea what the plan and timelines are." versus the current "Ok things are in limbo, something might change, at some point, what next? What now?"

Now we have a community of users and contributors sitting with projects in some sort of status limbo. Which "shouldn't" have any major impact or their use etc but from the outside looking in I would be completely unsurprised if in 3 or even 6 months they're still sitting in limbo. In which case we're going to end-up doing ourselves a huge dis-service. Whether or not these statuses were ever meant to impact public perception or not, I believe they do.

Rick

Jason you are absolutely correct and this type of accusations and behaviour
should not be allowed/tolerated at OWASP.

The reality is that Christian (as you can see on this thread) is the one
that tends to behave like that. There has been many 'arguments' and 'owasp
threads' in the past, but Christian is the one that brings that level of
conversion to the table.

Christian has already been banned (at least) twice in the past from OWASP,
and after many requests (by many parties) the current board (which should
be the 'referee' that you mention) has failed to put an end into it.

*My biggest problem with Christian's behaviour is not the accusations that
he makes *(although I have to say that being one of the many in the
receiving end of such personal attacks ,is not nice at all (specially when
he makes accusations about OWASP activities that took a lot of effort and
personal sacrifice)), *my biggest problem is the idea that such behaviour
is accepted/tolerated at OWASP*.

OWASP SHOULD NOT tolerate that type of behaviour, from anyone.

This doesn't mean that we should not disagree with each other, of course we
should, BUT it is key that the discussion is kept on a professional level
and there is a minimum level of respect.

And of course, if some OWASP leader or contributor feels that something is
really wrong , then yes that should be reported (with evidence supporting
it). But that is not what Christian does.

So please, can the OWASP board deal with this type of accusations! There
have been too many OWASP leaders and key contributors offended, which is
really the big loss here.

If anyone has any concerns about an individual's conduct on OWASP mailing
lists then they should report them to the OWASP Compliance officer as per
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Whistleblower_Policy
This is the correct way forward, and I'm sure that the number of complaints
against an individual will be taken into account.

Cheers,

Simon

Regarding Christian's abuses and attacks, that 'reporting' has been done
many times before, and this is not really a Whistleblower case since by
definition all that is happening is public domain, the issue is 'acceptance
(or not) of such behaviour'

Christian has already had his membership revoked for his behavior (long
before I got here) and he is currently not an OWASP member.  Can you please
be more clear on what your desired action against Christian would be at
this point?  If you're looking to remove him from the mailing list, I had
the Bylaws amended earlier this year to allow for that action if
needed/desired:

(Section 4.07 Participation)

Jason,

Dinis Cruz is well known to attempt to influence people against me
because his problem with me is that I denied him promotion of 02
during OWASP Europe 2008 i.e. I refused to cancel a panel session so
he could have a second 02 Presentation and also was applauded by the
fact that he turned up at HITB Amsterdam 2010 to promote 02 rather
than OWASP itself.

The OWASP Board i.e. Josh Sokol investigated this and confirmed that
this was the case i.e.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Inquiries/Google_Hacking_Project
and expanded on this comment within
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2014-February/013107.html

Furthermore, Jim Manico (OWASP Board) had also made some observations
of this fact in the past i.e.
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2012-July/007468.html

In addition, Dinis Cruz is well known to launch attacks against other
OWASP Members without any supporting evidence, such as Sarah Baso i.e.
http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/05/sarah-baso-as-owasp-executive-director.html

I would recommend that if OWASP Members want to raise a case against
me that you remove Dinis Cruz from the list of witnesses.  Also be
aware that any action against me will be unsuccessful as the OWASP
Board will have to make this admission in relation to Dinis Cruz as
per of their findings.

Josh,

I see your still hurt that I refused your offer to reinstate my
membership and have i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2014-February/013107.html
and consequently run back to Dinis Cruz.

I have no desire to become a member of OWASP and neither would I want
to be a member of an organisation that would seek me as a member.

As far as I am concerned, if the OWASP Board is going to hold
inquiries then those inquiries should address the root cause, i.e.
Chris Gatford, and not the contributing factors i.e. the OWASP Google
Hacking Project.

I look forward to the proposed involvement of Martin Knobloch and
finally bring closure to this issue.
