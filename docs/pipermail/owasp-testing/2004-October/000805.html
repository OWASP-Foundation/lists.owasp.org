<PRE>A few (marginal) comments below.
Congrats for the good doc.

Mauro


- page 11, regarding the statement 
  'The primary issue with OCTAVE is its use of
likelihood = 1, or
  &#147;all risks are equally risky&#148;', I believe it is not
entirely true;
  at least, OCTAVE-S (OCTAVE's tailored version for
  smaller enterprises) provides the means for
describing the likelihood of
  future occurrences of a threat (as well as recording
how often it occurred
  in the past), i.e. defining probabilities.
  If I remember correctly, in OCTAVE probabilities are
an optional feature.

- typo on page 12, should be &quot;if you want to know
what&#146;s really going on,
  go straight to the source&#148; instead of &quot;...to
straight to the source&quot;.
- typo on page 12, should be &quot;or is supposed to be
happening&quot; instead of
  ...suppose
- typo on page 12, should be &quot;Can miss calls to issues
in compiled libraries&quot;
  instead of &quot;can missed...&quot;
- typo on page 16, should be &quot;as&quot; instead of &quot;aw&quot;

- page 16 seems to be incomplete... (isn't it?

- page 26 Figure &quot;Typical SDLC Testing Workflow&quot;.
Shouldn't it include
  (in the development, deployment sections)
  test activities to validate the artifact being built
against functional and
  non-functional requirements? (the real test cases...
including
  acceptance tests if needed after deployment)
