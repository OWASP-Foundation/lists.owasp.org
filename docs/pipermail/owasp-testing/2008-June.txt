Hi,
as you know Arshan has just released a new interesting paper about
"Bypassing URL Authentication and Authorization with HTTP Verb
Tampering".
He agreed to include this new test in the Testing Guide.
The question is, where we can add this new testing technique?
In the paragraph: "Testing for HTTP Methods" or in
"Authentication/Authorization" section?
I personally think that is a new way to test for HTTP Method
(manipulating the HTTP verb to bypass security controls), but what is
your opinion?

Thanks,
Mat

I believe this should go in the authentication testing section as a
testing technique.  The HTTP methods section is meant for testing to
see if dangerous methods are allowed but this technique is to use
allowed methods to bypass authentication.  Just my 2 cents.

While the primary exploit scenarios will involve bypassing URL authentication and authorization, I believe it will be possible to use this technique for bypassing any security mechanism, depending on the configuration. To be practical, though, I agree - it should be in Authentication or Authorization, or both. 

On a side note, does anybody on the list with access to SiteMinder that can test these techniques against Default Resource Protection protected & unprotected and see the behavior?

Cheers,
Arshan

Hi,
we have almost defined the new Testing Guide index:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents

I think we can start writing articles. Deadline is 30th June.
There are still some sections available if you want to contribute.

Here are the rules to write the articles and paragraph template:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Writing_Style
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Template_Paragraph_Testing_v3

Please create an OWASP account and start editing the wike pages, I'll
notice all the edits and cooperate with you.
If you have any question please contact me!

Thanks,

Mat,

I feel a bit useless since the only chapter I am able to tell something
about are already written by someone else ...

Is there anybody I can help (with my limited knowledge of security testing,
but large experience in testing)...

I can do research, collect links or make some coffee if someone is living
nearby ;)

Expanding on Arshan's Bypassing URL Authorization thought,  anyone see any benefit to documenting techniques for trying to bypass "outbound" filtering - (like in form of a web proxy)?

example - recently beat outbound filtering by DWORD encoding the target ipaddress, and also by adding certain special characters to the end of the (prohibited) URL.  I'm sure that other filters apps could be beat by any number of URL encoding schemes.  

Little different slant than Arshan's verb tampering.  
Food for thought.

Hello Team,

I know everyone is busy writing but if anyone could help and do a
quick review of one of my sections I would appreciate it.  I know that
is going to be covered starting next month, but I have a few other
sections to write and want to make sure I am on the right track here
before I start the others.  Thanks again and I appreciate any
assistance.

Nice work, really.

If only I'm allowed a little side-note I've seen you've suggested the
use of webapp proxies for analyzing POST requests. It should, in my
opinion, be clarified that use of proxies (or browser plugins) are a
good methodology all-over even in GET requests.

More and more over, in fact, as you know GET and POSTs are manipuleted
or generated via JS and a clear imagine of what happens behind the
courtains of the code even taking a look at the page source. Add to
this multiple JS inclusion, a little bit of obfuscation (think about
Google Analytics scripts) and some fast redirect (as in Tivoli Access
Manager, for example) and I think anyone will understand why WebScarab
and/or Tamperdata and/or [include_your_fave_app_here] is vital...
...and better not forget those pesky little Iframes that always get
neglected when you don't use a proxy...

I know you use prokies, I see only the oportunity for doing some
gentle concept bashing into the minds of "newbies" and people seeking
a good start in a testing methodology :)

Of course these are just my $0.02 (or ?.0012 at the actual exchange rate =])

Matteo. (the OTHER italian Matteo)

Thank you for your responses.  As for the GET requests I intended the
proxy to be used for all requests not just the POST's. In the
description I say that I trap every request and every response
additionally I also note that every interesting GET/POST should be
recorded in the spreadsheet and cross referenced to the request number
in the proxy.  Although I will look at it again to try to make sure it
is more clear so that new readers to the project don't misunderstand
it.  Thanks again for all the help so far as it is very much
appreciated.

Kevin

All,

I have a general question which concerns all chapters of the manual.

In reviewing Kevin's piece I noticed the usage of 'I' and 'you'. Since I am
not a native English speaker I don't know about the rules in technical
english writing about this, but in my language this is considered
unprofessional and should be avoided at all times.

Can someone clear this up for me ? Is that 'allowed' or professional in the
english language ?

regards, dave

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Using Live Search to Discover Virtual Hosts
Message-ID: <000001c8c9f4$fbac10a0$6601a8c0@wrath>

Matteo,

To quote the OWASP Testing Guide v2 "4.2.3 Spidering and Googling" [1]:

<quote>

Using a search engine to discover virtual hosts 

Live.com, another well-known search engine (see link at the bottom of the
page), provides the "ip" operator, which returns all the pages that are
known to belong to a certain IP address. This is a very useful technique to
find out which virtual hosts are configured on the tested server. For
instance, the following query will return all indexed pages belonging to the
domain owasp.org: 

ip:216.48.3.18

</quote>

I believe this quote has some relation to the "Application Discovery" [2]
sub section of the OWASP Testing Guide v3.  

Therefore, can you consider creating a "Bridging" sub section between
"Search Engine Discovery" and "Application Discovery" within the OWASP
Testing Guide v3?

There are other techniques, such as mining TCP Ports, e-mail addresses, etc
with Search Engines which would also be relevant to this "Bridging" sub
section future versions of the OWASP Testing Guide.

Dan, 

It's been a while since I was in school, but yes, usually one would use "3rd person" for formal writing.  However - I think writing, especially within our security community, has gotten a lot less formal - which is ok.  We should probably just stay consistent throughout the document though.

Whilst the industry might have become slack with the use of english,  
business hasn't, especially when it comes to delivering reports that  
are read by senior management and board level members. There is  
nothing worse than a informal report being given to a client and them  
wondering if they indeed are actually dealing with a professional  
business person or a hacker.

Message-ID: <060920081217.7739.484D1F77000EF37000001E3B22120207840A9D0A079C09@comcast.net>

All,

Ref HTTP Method Section 4.3.8

Has anyone seen HTTP "TRACK" method enabled when "TRACE" was not?  Would it make sense to test for "TRACK" separately?  From what I've seen, TRACK behaves pretty much like TRACE - so you should be able to get an XST attack from it -  but I've only seen both or none.  I guess it might be a way to circumvent an ACL or filter if TRACE is prohibited?

Also, how about all the WEBDAV methods like LOCK, COPY, MOVE, etc?  http://www.webdav.org/specs/rfc2518.html#rfc.section.4.4

Is there a single method you can check to see if WEBDAV is enabled at all (like maybe PROPFIND)? (assuming something like OPTIONS doesn't already tell you)?  I havn't seen this too often, and was going to research this a little but thought someone might already have some insight.

-George

Talking about new thing/ways to test .. Did anybody see this blog:
http://0x000000.com/index.php?i=590&bin=1001001110
It's about using existing, available .js or other resource for generating
XSS and thus bypassing 'script filtering' and other blacklisting methods ...

Very interesting and also something to at least mention in the manual ?

I agree that no matter which route we take on this or anything else in
regards to the guide we should be consistent throughout.  Since I
believe this guide is targeted to the professional ethical hacker it
should be written in a more professional manner, as such I will update
my sections to reflect the "3rd person" more formal writing style.

Thanks again for the feedback!

Kevin

Hi Kevin & everyone,

A few things come to mind, none of which are specific to Kevin's
article.

1) I'd suggest we don't use "and/or" is looks indecisive/quick/messy.
I've got an illustrative example here if you care to take a look:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Rick.mitchell#.22and.2For.22_Explan
ation

2) We need to come up with a standard for section naming conventions
(this isn't unique to your article). wikipedia suggests only leading
caps however I think the overall plan here is to publish this as a *.doc
and *.pdf once complete so I suggest full title caps.

3) I suggest we add some sort of tag to the index page
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Content
s) similar to the "(new)" and "(toimp)" tags to indicate when sections
are ready to be reviewed. Perhaps (100), (toreview), or (reviewpls).

4) I agree we should attempt to write in the third person (as has been
discussed already).

5) If we're going to use slang terms like "automagically" we should
agree on a formatting scheme (unerline, italics, quoted, or whatever).

Other than that the article is in good shape. I made some minor edits
which you can see via the following diff:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing%3A_Identify_application_en
try_points&diff=30882&oldid=30711

Kinda related to that, section 4.5.1 isn't written yet, but the "vulnerability" is listed as "credential transport over an ecrypted channel" in the checklist.  

Should the "vulnerability" description say "un-encrypted" channel?  Or are we looking for something else (weak encryption?).  I just thought that particular one reads a little confusing compared to all the others (back to Rick's point) - unless I'm completely off on what this check is about.

I was replying to Kevin's request for review
(https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2008-June/001548.html).
 
Though you've raised a good point, I'm assuming the section you've
mentioned is meant to deal with credentials submitted via a http (not
https) form or via a form served via https with a http action.
Therefore, yes I would think that the actual heading should be
"Credential transport over an un-encrypted channel".
 
Rick

All,

Ref HTTP Method Section 4.3.8

Has anyone seen HTTP "TRACK" method enabled when "TRACE" was not?  Would it make sense to test for "TRACK" separately?  From what I've seen, TRACK behaves pretty much like TRACE - so you should be able to get an XST attack from it -  but I've only seen both or none.  I guess it might be a way to circumvent an ACL or filter if TRACE is prohibited?

Also, how about all the WEBDAV methods like LOCK, COPY, MOVE, etc?  http://www.webdav.org/specs/rfc2518.html#rfc.section.4.4

Is there a single method you can check to see if WEBDAV is enabled at all (like maybe PROPFIND)? (assuming something like OPTIONS doesn't already tell you)?  I havn't seen this too often, and was going to research this a little but thought someone might already have some insight.

...or whatever you want to call it.

Works fine - at least with stored/persistent XSS so far.  I'll play with it some more tomorrow.

The key is that you ahve to exploit a page which is already importing the .js file.  So when you create content via XSS on that page, you can access the functions in the .js file.   

So insead of having to inject all the JavaScript code and use script tags, you simply call SomeObscureFunction('malicious_input') in, for instance a link or something.

There may be actually be a way to dynamically load the the .js file onto the page via the XSS itself - stay tuned.

Anyway, Neat.  I'm with Dave, I think it should at least be mentioned as a technique to bypass filtering somewhere, maybe with an example.

From what I've seen, TRACK behaves pretty much like TRACE - so you should be able to get an XST attack from it -  but I've only seen both or none.  I guess it might be a way to circumvent an ACL or filter if TRACE is prohibited?

Also, how about all the WEBDAV methods like LOCK, COPY, MOVE, etc?  http://www.webdav.org/specs/rfc2518.html#rfc.section.4.4

Is there a single method you can check to see if WEBDAV is enabled at all (like maybe PROPFIND)? (assuming something like OPTIONS doesn't already tell you)?  I havn't seen this too often, and was going to research this a little but thought someone might already have some insight.

Talking about new thing/ways to test .. Did anybody see this blog:
http://0x000000.com/index.php?i=590&bin=1001001110
It's about using existing, available .js or other resource for generating
XSS and thus bypassing 'script filtering' and other blacklisting methods ...

Very interesting and also something to at least mention in the manual ?

I agree that no matter which route we take on this or anything else in
regards to the guide we should be consistent throughout.  Since I
believe this guide is targeted to the professional ethical hacker it
should be written in a more professional manner, as such I will update
my sections to reflect the "3rd person" more formal writing style.

Thanks again for the feedback!

Hi Kevin & everyone,

A few things come to mind, none of which are specific to Kevin's
article.

1) I'd suggest we don't use "and/or" is looks indecisive/quick/messy.
I've got an illustrative example here if you care to take a look:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Rick.mitchell#.22and.2For.22_Explan
ation

2) We need to come up with a standard for section naming conventions
(this isn't unique to your article). wikipedia suggests only leading
caps however I think the overall plan here is to publish this as a *.doc
and *.pdf once complete so I suggest full title caps.

3) I suggest we add some sort of tag to the index page
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Content
s) similar to the "(new)" and "(toimp)" tags to indicate when sections
are ready to be reviewed. Perhaps (100), (toreview), or (reviewpls).

4) I agree we should attempt to write in the third person (as has been
discussed already).

5) If we're going to use slang terms like "automagically" we should
agree on a formatting scheme (unerline, italics, quoted, or whatever).

Other than that the article is in good shape. I made some minor edits
which you can see via the following diff:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing%3A_Identify_application_en
try_points&diff=30882&oldid=30711

According to: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb878014(TechNet.10).aspx "IIS does not have a built in way to enable or disable WebDAV on a per site basis. In IIS 5, WebDAV is enabled for all websites by default. To disable it, use URLScan to block incoming WebDAV requests (which are blocked by default) or see the Knowledge Base article How to disable WebDAV for IIS 5.0. With IIS 6, you simply enable or disable WebDAV with the Web Service Extensions node in IIS Manager. WebDAV is disabled in IIS 6 by default."

According to http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3104921 you can use UrlScan (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc242650.aspx) to disable all the WebDAV related HTTP verbs/methods. (This method is also mentioned in the earlier technet link above).

I have a first draft ready for review.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist

Please review for format and structure at this point.
We can get to content, and checks after we agree on the format.

.xls is not an allowed file type currently.  Do we want to allow it?
If not, ill just continue to zip it.
Would open office be better, or does everyone have excel?

Thanks!
Ron


".xls" is an unwanted file type

     List of allowed file types: mp3, gif, png, jpg, jpeg, doc, ppt,  
mp3, pdf, psd, zip, tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, jar, docx, pptx

OpenOffice is perfectly capable of handling xls files and we already allow
doc and ppt so I see no reason in not allowing xls.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Time Based Blind SQL Injection Testing
Message-ID: <6dc88c3c0806270216v2fc6dbd9wde0044ba5cdec16a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, for OWASP Testing Guide v3,

I was reading Testing SQL Injection  -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection and noticed that
there is no mention of time based blind SQL Injections.

AFAIK this section's already assigned to improve, If it's not in the plan
it's a good idea to add this since it's quite critical, also if it's
required I can help in that bit to write or review.


Regards,

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Testing Multiple Factors Authentication
Message-ID: <a30fee8f0806281258l5ec934d0ta6f92d6b5395ee63@mail.gmail.com>

I think that in the Authentication section, would fit a section about
testing Multiple Factors Authentication.

Multiple Factors Authentications in a real world scenario include:

-	One-time password (OTP) generator tokens
-	Crypto devices like USB tokens or smart cards, equipped with X.509
certificates
-	Random OTP sent via SMS
-	Personal information that only the legitimate user is supposed to
know [OUTOFWALLET]

Any of these solutions could have specific vulnerabilities, and need
to be tested accurately. A multiple factor authentication schema is a
common way to prevent online phishing, just in case that is correctly
implemented. Let's assume that the OTP token in use permits several
transaction during a timeframe of 30 seconds; in this particular case,
an attacker may be able to submit multiple requests via a common
credential theft performed through a phishing attack.

USB tokens vary from vendor to vendor. Some of them authorize a user
when they are plugged, and do not authorize operations when they are
unplugged. It seems to be a good behavior, but what it look likes is
that some of them add further layers of implicit authentication. Those
devices, do not protect users from Session Riding and empower
attackers that may use Cross Site Scripting code for automating
transfers.

SMS solutions on the other side, seem to be more secure, because may
be used to authenticate a single transaction (Transaction Based
Authentication), and to inform a user about what is going on. Too many
times happen that the SMS gateway is a software package installed on
the application server that is configured to log information locally.
During a real test, an authentication bypassing attept was performed
reading the local logfiles of the SMS gateway through a Path Traversal
vulnerability. Of course this is a Blended Threat scenario, but it
needs a specific test since is a common bad practice.

The previous are just some of the ideas.
If you would like to contribute for comments, suggestions,
improvements, opinions about the need of this section, or anything
else you are welcome.

Giorgio

Hi Ronbo,
Thank you for your effort.

I think this kind of checklist is usefull, but we have to follow the
Testing Guide Index and that list of controls:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents
Maybe we can create 2 documents (doc format i think it's better):
- one for the list of tests to perform
- one to explain the checklist
What do you think about that?

Thanks,
Mat

Hi,
that's a good point.
It's important to write good quality articles also from an english
language point of view.
Last year we did a great job but the Guide still suffers of many
grammatical problems. That's why we need 2-3 reviewers that can

Yes

Yes we have for example Testing_for_Directory_Traversal:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Directory_Traversal


3) I suggest we add some sort of tag to the index page
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Content
s) similar to the "(new)" and "(toimp)" tags to indicate when sections
are ready to be reviewed. Perhaps (100), (toreview), or (reviewpls).

100% percent meaning that section is ready to be reviewed.

4) I agree we should attempt to write in the third person (as has been
discussed already).

I agree, I'm checking all articles and the reviewers will do that.

5) If we're going to use slang terms like "automagically" we should
agree on a formatting scheme (unerline, italics, quoted, or whatever).
I agree

Thanks,
Mat

Thanks for the work you have put in so far Mat!  If you get a chance
could you add to the discussion portion of each article for what needs
to be changed or modified to bring it to 100%.  Thanks.

Matteo,

Can you please mark
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders_Robots_and_Crawlers to be
reviewed?

The major change from v2 is that I have removed the content relevant to
search engines and revised the "Brief Summary", "Description of the Issue"
and "References" while retaining the original text from "Black Box testing
and example".

Hello Christian

I took the liberty to review the page.

I notice there are several remaining ellipsis. Do they signify "to be
continued" or do they mean something else?

And also, it could be good to explain "map", "points of access", "gate"
based on the result of a sample test.

Thoughts?

Cheers
Nam

Nam,

NN>I notice there are several remaining ellipsis. Do they signify "to be
NN>continued" or do they mean something else?

The ellipsis where included as part of the v3 draft template.  I have since
removed them excluding the ellipsis listed in the "Black Box testing and
example" section which was duplicated from v2 at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spidering_and_googling

NN>And also, it could be good to explain "map", "points of access", "gate"
NN>based on the result of a sample test.

Again, this was duplicated from v2 at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spidering_and_googling

That stated I believe the author intended to refer to entry point(s) of a
web application (or site map), such as its initial home page or login page.

The reader can also refer to the References section
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Spiders_Robots_and_Crawlers#Referen
ces for further clarification if required.

The main purpose of my effort was to separate the combined content within v2
into separate sections of v3 i.e. "Spiders/Robots/Crawlers" and "Search
Engine Discovery".

Matteo,

I have completed the draft transfer of the content relevant to Google from
the "Spidering and googling" section of v2.

The draft can be viewed at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Search_engine_discovery and I have
incorporated reference to other Search Engines, such as Live Search, etc.

Hi,
during "Information Gathering" phase I use sophisticated search/mining and
correlation system Maltego http://www.paterva.com/maltego/ 
(I have no relation with that company!) 
But this tool significantly helps me in "completely passive" discovery 
(reveals a lot of mobile numbers, addresses, contacts, real owners of audited 
web site etc.)

I think this kind of tools should be mentioned in "Information Gathering"
phase of the testing guide, because they are really helpful.

And for all, do you know any opensource alternative of this tool
(ok, there is a community version of Maltego 
http://www.paterva.com/maltego/community-edition/, but quite limited)

Thanks and regards,

Pavol
