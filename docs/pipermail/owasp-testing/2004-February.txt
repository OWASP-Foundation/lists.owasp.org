OK guys

I have taken the liberty of adding some people I trust and respect to this
list and a few that asked to join over the last month or so.  You can lurk
or chime in if you feel appropriate (after all I press ganged you). You
could also contribute (pretty please)!

With next weeks announcement of the Web Security Consortium at RSA which
seems to be made up of scanning vendors, I think it has never been more
important to get the OWASP Testing Guide 1.0 out into the public. At this
point you can only imagine that any guides they produce will prescribe
scanning, more scanning and a side of scanning. We all know from bitter
experience (and testing using WebGoat) that those tools usually find about
20% of issues and are not a way to strategically deal with the web security
issues. 

Testing security of applications must be about testing the development
process, and implementation and not just pen testing which is after the
fact, "hit and miss" and costly. It has to focus on the big picture. I know
that the majority of organizations in the US I speak to are trying to move
away from the pen test mentality having seen the futility and I hope the
OWASP Testing Guide can help layout the foundation for an enterprise testing
framework for everyone.  

So I am asking for you to all rally around and get Part 1 of testing
completed and out within the next month and then start working on Part 2.

A while back we decided it was easier to split testing into 2 parts. 

Part 1 - The Why, What, Where and When
Part 2 - The How

The idea is that Part 1 sets the scene for the scope of testing, explains
the pros and cons of each technique, how to build a testing framework in an
organization and the types of testing that are appropriate. 

Part 2 then follows up with detailed advice on how to test for specific
issues using these techniques (i.e. not just pen testing, do X and you'll
then see Y) including how to look for design issues and issues in code and
implementation (black box).

I will send on my current working Part 1 draft in a few minutes which is
rough at this stage. Here is what I am proposing of an aggressive timeline. 

Week 1 (rest of this week) - Agree the table of contents and document flow
Week 2 - Assign chapters to people to write next week (yes next week)
Week 3 - Review and format the content
Week 4 - final review and release

We can then work on a schedule for Part 2

OK this is a very early working draft. I was intending to spend a week
of evening and get this finished in Feb but more eyes and more inout the
better. 

I think rather than delve into edits, lets organize into a few small
working groups on each chapter. We can then do peer reviews etc and work
faster. 

I think the Chapters are almost there; we have 6 (remember this is only
Part 1)

1. Introduction
2. Reasons for Testing
3. Scope of Testing
4. Principles
5. Testing Techniques
6. Testing Frameowrk Explained

Is this a good flow ? Should there be other stuff ?

Am I correct in thinking that for part 1 we are talking about the broad

Great news. Focused as am I. I think actually Part 1 is maybe a higher
more strategic level than that. 

Its more about explaining why you need to think about testing throughout
the SDLC and not just at the end or when a site is built; its about
explaining that by testing a design for security you can typically save
100 times the cost of fixing an error in production that could have been
corrected at the design stage. Its about exposing the advantages and
disadvantages of all testing techniques i.e why code review is hard to
do but effective, why black box testing is cheap (and widely used) but
often ineffective (well strategically, it's obviously often effective
tactically). 

And I think its about presenting an enterprise testing framework that a
medium to large company can build into their SDLC to ensure the right
type of testing is done and the right times to deal with the problem
strategically. 

Of course this is not set in stone (this is your project as much as it
is mine) but these are my thoughts. 

Part 2 (which is likely to be a lot more text than Part 1) would be the
mechanics of testing for specific issues such as the great session ID
stuff you created.

i like the idea of doing this intro as so many times its not covered by any books and it
will set the scene for the rest
of the guide.

OK so looks like we are all happy with the basic outline we have today
for Part 1, so I am afraid to say its time to sign up to complete a
section before the end of next week as we discussed. By the way end of
next week should mean 6pm Friday 27th Feb Pacific time I think. I know
its RSA etc but ....

Please please don't sign up to do anything if you are going to not pull
out all the stops to meet the deadline, but please please please do sign
up for something !

I suggest we have a few people working on each section, if we have more
that 6 volunteers. Divide and conquer baby !

This is what I think each chapter in Part 1 needs to achieve. And
remember Part 1 is the What, Why, When, Where and Part 2 will be the
How.

1. Introduction
This chapter should set the scene of web applications, OWASP and how
people can use this guide

2. Reasons for Testing
This chapter should outline the end goal of building secure software and
explain how testing should be performed against requirements or
standards, best practices etc and what you can aim to achieve through
testing.

3. Scope of Testing
This chapter should set the scene that testing web applications (or web
software as I am coming to call it myself) covers testing requirements,
designs, process and implementations i.e. isn't about scanning.

4. Principles
This chapter will be a set of high level principles such as "Test Early
and Often". I think this would be good to debate over the list this
week.

5. Testing Techniques
This chapter should provide an overview of the types of testing
techniques that exist including unit testing and code coverage / review,
pen testing, threat modeling requirements and design testing etc. I
think it should explain where each maybe appropriate in an SDLC and the
advantages and disadvantages of each.

6. Testing Framework Explained
This chapter should outline a proposed framework for testing that will
incorporate the techniques described at various places in the SDLC. It
will be more of a suggested way to create a testing process in an
organization. 

I will sign up to do Chapter 1 on my own (as its easy) and Chapter 5. 

Anyone else have any specific interests ?

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Testing Sign Up



OK so looks like we are all happy with the basic outline we have today 
for Part 1, so I am afraid to say its time to sign up to complete a 
section before the end of next week as we discussed. By the way end of 
next week should mean 6pm Friday 27th Feb Pacific time I think. I know 
its RSA etc but .... 

Please please don't sign up to do anything if you are going to not pull 
out all the stops to meet the deadline, but please please please do sign 
up for something ! 

I suggest we have a few people working on each section, if we have more 
that 6 volunteers. Divide and conquer baby ! 

This is what I think each chapter in Part 1 needs to achieve. And 
remember Part 1 is the What, Why, When, Where and Part 2 will be the 
How. 

1. Introduction 
This chapter should set the scene of web applications, OWASP and how 
people can use this guide 

2. Reasons for Testing 
This chapter should outline the end goal of building secure software and 
explain how testing should be performed against requirements or 
standards, best practices etc and what you can aim to achieve through 
testing. 

3. Scope of Testing 
This chapter should set the scene that testing web applications (or web 
software as I am coming to call it myself) covers testing requirements, 
designs, process and implementations i.e. isn't about scanning. 

4. Principles 
This chapter will be a set of high level principles such as "Test Early 
and Often". I think this would be good to debate over the list this 
week. 

5. Testing Techniques 
This chapter should provide an overview of the types of testing 
techniques that exist including unit testing and code coverage / review, 
pen testing, threat modeling requirements and design testing etc. I 
think it should explain where each maybe appropriate in an SDLC and the 
advantages and disadvantages of each. 

6. Testing Framework Explained 
This chapter should outline a proposed framework for testing that will 
incorporate the techniques described at various places in the SDLC. It 
will be more of a suggested way to create a testing process in an 
organization. 

I will sign up to do Chapter 1 on my own (as its easy) and Chapter 5. 

Anyone else have any specific interests ?

I can propose to work on this but mark can we go into a little more detail on how much and what all is to be covered are we going to do methodology for black box testing / white bbox testing etc with examples ?
 
Chapter 5 -

I agree, although it will potentially make Part 1 a bit 'light'.  

Perhaps as part of the 'reasons for testing' we can mention the OWASP Top
Ten and introduce a bit of SPIN to the process - this is what'll happen if
you *don't* develop securely.  These can then again be mentioned in 'testing
techniques' to illustrate where they would have been picked up.  E.g. 'input
validation strategies would be assessed during the design review, prototype
testing, code review and deployment black-box testing'.

		OK so looks like we are all happy with the basic outline
we have today 
		for Part 1, so I am afraid to say its time to sign up to
complete a 
		section before the end of next week as we discussed. By
the way end of 
		next week should mean 6pm Friday 27th Feb Pacific time I
think. I know 
		its RSA etc but .... 

		Please please don't sign up to do anything if you are
going to not pull 
		out all the stops to meet the deadline, but please
please please do sign 
		up for something ! 

		I suggest we have a few people working on each section,
if we have more 
		that 6 volunteers. Divide and conquer baby ! 

		This is what I think each chapter in Part 1 needs to
achieve. And 
		remember Part 1 is the What, Why, When, Where and Part 2
will be the 
		How. 

		1. Introduction 
		This chapter should set the scene of web applications,
OWASP and how 
		people can use this guide 

		2. Reasons for Testing 
		This chapter should outline the end goal of building
secure software and 
		explain how testing should be performed against
requirements or 
		standards, best practices etc and what you can aim to
achieve through 
		testing. 

		3. Scope of Testing 
		This chapter should set the scene that testing web
applications (or web 
		software as I am coming to call it myself) covers
testing requirements, 
		designs, process and implementations i.e. isn't about
scanning. 

		4. Principles 
		This chapter will be a set of high level principles such
as "Test Early 
		and Often". I think this would be good to debate over
the list this 
		week. 

		5. Testing Techniques 
		This chapter should provide an overview of the types of
testing 
		techniques that exist including unit testing and code
coverage / review, 
		pen testing, threat modeling requirements and design
testing etc. I 
		think it should explain where each maybe appropriate in
an SDLC and the 
		advantages and disadvantages of each. 

		6. Testing Framework Explained 
		This chapter should outline a proposed framework for
testing that will 
		incorporate the techniques described at various places
in the SDLC. It 
		will be more of a suggested way to create a testing
process in an 
		organization. 

		I will sign up to do Chapter 1 on my own (as its easy)
and Chapter 5. 

		Anyone else have any specific interests ?

Message-ID: <7274FE6068F1DE49B8AA0258E92C5A3C01323968@shasta.foundstone.com>

Assignments so far for the end of the week.

Chapter 

1. Introduction - Curphey
2. Reasons for Testing - Davis ?
3. Scope of Testing - Curphey
4. Principles - Carl Davis
5. Testing Techniques - Nish and Harinath
6. Testing Framework Explained - Curphey, Williams (press ganged), van
Wyk (press ganged), Glyn

I think it would be great to double up on each chapter so anyone else
want to sign up before we start. Prob 24 hours left if you are
interested ;-) If not sit back and prepare to review ;-)

I know many of these chapters need to flow and we need to ensure what we
are saying in say 3 fits into Chapter 6 so please communicate over the
list as you write content so we can keep in sync.

Thanks

Mark

Hi all, Mark

I supposed it was because it was Friday night I forgot to send my thoughts before going out of town and have no access to my email, I'll send them anyway so people in corresponding chapters can take them in account. I do agree with the outline (mostly)

1. I didn't see any "Security issue tracking" suggested/mentioned in testing guide. Information gotten from a security testing is precious and not only useful to fix those issues.  I think we can go a little further with this by suggesting to use that information so companies can deploy training plans (or any appropriated action) in the most recurrent issues to create you own security culture. Information is power have to be used!

Excellent point. All part of an enterprise program. Noted with thanks.


2. I suggest peer-to-peer reviews as other alternative technique, due to "programming immersion" we often omit security issues other can see later.

Good point. 

I want to participate in chapters 3, 4, and 5 if it is not too late for that.

OK then I am on 3, Carl Davis on 4 and Nish / Harinath on 5. Please contact them on list or off list to work out logistics. 

Cheers

Regards,
JC

OK so looks like we are all happy with the basic outline we have today for Part 1, so I am afraid to say its time to sign up to complete a section before the end of next week as we discussed. By the way end of next week should mean 6pm Friday 27th Feb Pacific time I think. I know its RSA etc but ....

Please please don't sign up to do anything if you are going to not pull out all the stops to meet the deadline, but please please please do sign up for something !

I suggest we have a few people working on each section, if we have more that 6 volunteers. Divide and conquer baby !

This is what I think each chapter in Part 1 needs to achieve. And remember Part 1 is the What, Why, When, Where and Part 2 will be the How.

1. Introduction
This chapter should set the scene of web applications, OWASP and how people can use this guide

2. Reasons for Testing
This chapter should outline the end goal of building secure software and explain how testing should be performed against requirements or standards, best practices etc and what you can aim to achieve through testing.

3. Scope of Testing
This chapter should set the scene that testing web applications (or web software as I am coming to call it myself) covers testing requirements, designs, process and implementations i.e. isn't about scanning.

4. Principles
This chapter will be a set of high level principles such as "Test Early and Often". I think this would be good to debate over the list this week.

5. Testing Techniques
This chapter should provide an overview of the types of testing techniques that exist including unit testing and code coverage / review, pen testing, threat modeling requirements and design testing etc. I think it should explain where each maybe appropriate in an SDLC and the advantages and disadvantages of each.

6. Testing Framework Explained
This chapter should outline a proposed framework for testing that will incorporate the techniques described at various places in the SDLC. It will be more of a suggested way to create a testing process in an organization. 

I will sign up to do Chapter 1 on my own (as its easy) and Chapter 5. 

Anyone else have any specific interests ?

I want to help with sections 2 (Reasons for Testing) and section 5 
(Testing Techniques)

I also think can gather reviewers for all sections from my company-s 
development department. If others are ok, I would like to pass the 
document around so I can gather more input/reviewing.

Javier

I apologize for not getting this out sooner but work has been busier then
normal.  Anywho,  I have included in this email and attached a draft
(outline format) of the 'Ten Principles for Application Security Testing'
[Chapter 4] for hashing out, comments, suggested changes, etc. by the group.
My current plan is to briefly speak to each bullet in the paragraph
accompanying each heading; principles, bullets, etc. are by no means set in
stone at this point.
 
On a separate but related note...I volunteered to help out with Chapter 2,
the 'Regulatory Requirements' section and noticed that there was a question
mark next to my name for this chapter in a previous email detailing
assignments.  Also, Javier has more recently volunteered to help out with
this chapter as well so, I was wondering how you would like to handle?  I
would not mind still helping out with Regu Reqs but if Javier is going to
cover this section that is fine too.
 
I really look forward to everyone's feedback (good or bad) regarding the 10
Principles.
 
Cheers,
 
- Carl
 
------------
 Ten Principles for Application Security Testing

There is No Silver Bullet
 - One glove (testing approach) does not fit all
 - Design based on requirements and other governing factors i.e.
limitations, costs, etc.

Think Strategically, Not Tactically
 - Build security into the test plan
 - Establish test methods
 - Identify security issues during the design review phase
 - Build in security in-depth (layered approach)
 - Ask questions regarding future requirements/enhancements
 - Future growth

Test Early and Test Often
 - Substantial cost savings 
 - Test in development, QA, and production environments 
     (limited access prior to "going live")
 - Work closely with responsible teams during the development 
     process to remediate or mitigate issues 
 - Establish a Due Care process based on risk level
 - Educate developers about Web App sec issues

Understand the Scope
 - Governing regulatory requirements
 - Level of security required i.e. sensitive, Top Secret 
 - Timeframe (schedule)
 - Interviews with developers, involved teams, and project leads
 - Complexity of project
 - Approval requirements
 - Proof of concept (yes or no)
 - Cost limitations (time to market)
 - Classification of data e.g. GLBA, Cardholder, CA SB1386, etc. 

Mindset
 - Think like a hacker or cracker
 - Customize your approach and or methodology
 - Think outside of the box
 - Try the unexpected; be creative
 
Know Thy Target
 - User & Administrative documentation
 - Architectural diagrams and data flow charts  
 - Technical system and application documentation
 - Disallowed functionality/intentions
 - Understand the threat and known exploits
 - Understand regulatory requirements
 - Thoroughly research application & systems being used
 - Conduct passive & active recon

Use the Right Tools
 - Use a combination automated and manual techniques
 - Frequently update tool & technique inventory
 - Become intimately familiar with technology being used and 
   known/probable security issues
 - Shouldn't bring a knife to a gun fight

Attention to Detail
 - Weed out false positives
 - Thoroughly explore logic in an attempt to expose flaws
 - Look for the less obvious security issues
 - Become intimate with the application
 - Evaluate every aspect

Use Manual Source Code Inspections Whenever Possible
 - Allows for the identification of security holes and 
   vulnerabilities often missed by black or gray box testing
 - Reinforce secure coding practices 
 - Should include User Interface development 

Use the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
 - Structured approach that provides guidance regarding the handling 
   of IT Security activities throughout the life of the system or
application

           Ten Principles for Application Security Testing


There is No Silver Bullet

	-	One glove (testing approach) does not fit all
	-	Design based on requirements and other governing factors i.e. limitations, costs, etc.


Think Strategically, Not Tactically

	-	Build security into the test plan
	-	Establish test methods
	-	Identify security issues during the design review phase
	-	Build in security in-depth (layered approach)
	-	Ask questions regarding future requirements/enhancements
	-	Future growth


Test Early and Test Often

	-	Substantial cost savings 
	-	Test in development, QA, and production environments 
	    (limited access prior to "going live")
	-	Work closely with responsible teams during the development 
	    process to remediate or mitigate issues 
	-	Establish a Due Care process based on risk level
	-	Educate developers about Web App sec issues


Understand the Scope

	-	Governing regulatory requirements
	-	Level of security required i.e. sensitive, Top Secret 
	-	Timeframe (schedule)
	-	Interviews with developers, involved teams, and project leads
	-	Complexity of project
	-	Approval requirements
	-	Proof of concept (yes or no)
	-	Cost limitations (time to market)
	-	Classification of data e.g. GLBA, Cardholder, CA SB1386, etc. 


Mindset

	-	Think like a hacker or cracker
	-	Customize your approach and or methodology
	-	Think outside of the box
	-	Try the unexpected; be creative



Know Thy Target

	-	User & Administrative documentation
	-	Architectural diagrams and data flow charts  
	-	Technical system and application documentation
	-	Disallowed functionality/intentions
	-	Understand the threat and known exploits
	-	Understand regulatory requirements
	-	Thoroughly research application & systems being used
	-	Conduct passive & active recon


Use the Right Tools

	-	Use a combination automated and manual techniques
	-	Frequently update tool & technique inventory
	-	Become intimately familiar with technology being used and 
	    known/probable security issues
	-	Shouldn't bring a knife to a gun fight


Attention to Detail

	-	Weed out false positives
	-	Thoroughly explore logic in an attempt to expose flaws
	-	Look for the less obvious security issues
	-	Become intimate with the application
	-	Evaluate every aspect


Use Manual Source Code Inspections Whenever Possible

	-	Allows for the identification of security holes and 
	    vulnerabilities often missed by black or gray box testing
	-	Reinforce secure coding practices 
	-	Should include User Interface development 


Use the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

	-	Structured approach that provides guidance regarding the handling 
	    of IT Security activities throughout the life of the system or application

Guys
 
I recommend you too look in Gatner for statistics about security issues
in applications, I heard somethie they say 75% of security issues are
located in Web Applications rather than in Infrastructure.

Hi guys, obvioiusly the ultra agressive timeline won't be met but we are active which is a great thing. If you want to send me your current drafts in ind chapter word docs, we can make sure they are on track etc. I have been travelling but will have mine later today. I was working with some others but haven't been able to communicate with them so I will send you guys mydraft and you can add / delete / flame me...I am thick skinned.

I will be off of planes finally later tonight so will send a sumaary tomorow.

I traced that comment back once and it was a flippant comment by John
Pescatore in an interview with an online journal...I have had my
marketingdept searching Gartner, Meta, Jupiter etc for research but so far
they have not come up with anything...to that available we have a metrics
project going on at work analyzing advisories and issues to develop the
stats. We need a large sample and it will take a long time.

Hi Carl / all,
 
I think the paragraph idea for format is great. We did with the OWASP Top
Ten so it would kind of flow a bit better.
 
I put an example of it it in a word doc and tracking on for easier
collaboration. Hope that was OK.
 
I added a principle of Metrics, i.e. know what your problems are so you can
systematically improve or focus attention on areas that are most common.
Again just an idea. 
 
Anyone else have any ideas on what the principles should be ?
 
Mark

I apologize for not getting this out sooner but work has been busier then
normal.  Anywho,  I have included in this email and attached a draft
(outline format) of the 'Ten Principles for Application Security Testing'
[Chapter 4] for hashing out, comments, suggested changes, etc. by the group.
My current plan is to briefly speak to each bullet in the paragraph
accompanying each heading; principles, bullets, etc. are by no means set in
stone at this point.
 
On a separate but related note...I volunteered to help out with Chapter 2,
the 'Regulatory Requirements' section and noticed that there was a question
mark next to my name for this chapter in a previous email detailing
assignments.  Also, Javier has more recently volunteered to help out with
this chapter as well so, I was wondering how you would like to handle?  I
would not mind still helping out with Regu Reqs but if Javier is going to
cover this section that is fine too.
 
I really look forward to everyone's feedback (good or bad) regarding the 10
Principles.
 
Cheers,

Glyn, Any chance we can use the Chapter you wrote on Session Management
Testing as an appendix to Testing Part 1 to show readers what to expect
in Part 2 ? 

Anyone volunteer to write a chapter a section on using Code Review to
test session Management that will compliment Glyns Chapter (which was
pen testing focused) ?

I was thinking of something like this for the Framework Chapter itself.
What do you think ?

Essentially presenting a generic SDLC and highlighting activities that
could / should be carried out at each stage in the dev process. 

Does this make sense?

If so I will fill in the text tonight....

Damn now its out that I am late as well ;-)

Mark,

I think this is great and will be very useful to the larger software
development shops. What would you think about extending this a bit earlier
in the lifecycle to *requirements definition*?  The problem I've experienced
is that the testers would test the security requirements if there were any,
but they're all just "best practices" or "tech memos" or something. They
don't get formalized as requirements, so they never get tested.

Also, what are your thoughts about the requirements themselves? Do you
think"negative use cases" are a good idea, or do you stick with more
traditional "shalls". What type of requirement do you recommend to make sure
that the proper type of security testing actually gets done?

I was thinking of something like this for the Framework Chapter itself.
What do you think ?

Essentially presenting a generic SDLC and highlighting activities that
could / should be carried out at each stage in the dev process.

Does this make sense?

If so I will fill in the text tonight....

Damn now its out that I am late as well ;-)

Looks good.

I think there is a place for black-box testing alongside code reviews during
development too.

For example, this can include testing the data interfaces of discrete
application components as they are developed, analysing their interaction
and the traffic flow.  

This ultimately leads on to deployment testing which is often focussed more
on the application's interaction with end users than interaction within
itself.

Our testing typically loops through the intended operation of the
app/component, its actual behaviour, and its impact on security as a whole.

Absolutely - the nature of consultancy is that you're buying a person's
skills for a period of time, and better be damn sure they have the skills to
sell.  But I think that relates as much to a code review as app testing.

If we consider that Risk is a product of both the impact of the issue and
its exposure, then the data interfaces and particularly the user facing ones
are most likely to present the highest risks.

We've found that while a code review will identify most of the problems
within an app, it can be a time-intensive (and therefore costly) process,
and a lot of effort may be focussed on areas that aren't really exposing the
application to attack.  Analogies can be drawn with infrastructure
pen-testing - you should be looking for all the problems, but a phased
approach to find the critically exposed ones is at least a start point.

Equally, with app testing it is easy to miss serious problems that might not
be immediately visible from the 'outside' that would be picked up in a code
review.

I think both are highly valuable - app testing allows the highest exposed
problem areas to be found and access to the source code allows a thorough
analysis.

Obviously I'm coming from an external consultants perspective and getting
the right ROI balance is essential.  We tend to impart code-review knowledge
to the client through workshops with the developers, review their own
security reviews and supplement that with app-security testing and targeted
code review.

I think we should take our usual approach of describing both methods with
their respective pros and cons, and let the reader decide.  With unlimited
budget and resource, the whole plan can be followed.  With reduced resource
an educated decision can be made about which parts of the guide to embrace.

These kinds of debates have raged through all my and your time as a
Consultants & are likely to carry on a while, I think!

I think nothing but good can come from getting exactly this dicussion out in
the open.

My experience is that most vulnerabilities are found (far) more quickly by
looking at the source than by any other method.  *BUT* it takes a long time
to get fast.  You need people who are very good programmers (that for
whatever reason don't want to write code everyday) AND they need to know a
lot about security and what the patterns look like in different languages.

Comparing the approaches is a bit of apples and oranges. Penetration testing
generally doesn't search everything and has a lot of false alarms.  If we
did a code review to that level, we could finish in 1/10 of the time. But we
can be far more complete and accurate by checking the code. I'm not against
pentesting -- there are many reasons why code is not available.

There are, of course, some problems that pentesting is faster at -- 
particularly web and app server configuration issues. But there are also
many problems that could NEVER be found with pentesting -- logic problems,
hidden features, dead code, thread safety, and lots more.  This is where we
find the biggest problems by the way.

I disagree with recommending code review during development and pentest
after.  Actually, I think it would be best to do some of each (with internal
people) throughout the lifecycle. Then maybe a third party review to confirm
before deployment.

Smart Ass : To play devils advocate for a while I used to think the same.
But it was a factor of the skills I had in my team. Many OWASP'ers and
particulary webappsec'rs are or have been pen testers and not coders. We
used to have people doing app testing at a previous compnay in Atlanta that
werent developers and so there was a slower ramp up and so on. I think Jeff
Williams did some stats on speed of finding bugs by code review and pen
testing. Jeff are those available ?

Smart ass : I agree with caveats. That is I think we need to take the high
ground and tell people that if you want to find low hanging fruit then pen
testing may help in development but we need to phrase it in a similar way ie
low hanging fruit. Sanctums Crap Scan DE is a great example of how bad
finding bugs using pen testing in development can be for example (although
thats a factor of bad tool and technique IMHO). Its not intuitive for
developers who are used to working in code, may not have a deployed app and
are used to writing unit tests / code coverage.

>Smart ass: I hear you. Its also hard when we all know how much money
consultants are making doing web app pen tests. But I think one thing OWASP
has been able to do is to take the high ground irrespective or our own
circumstances and root to the truth and help push the market towards doing
the best thing. This is def true of helping people understand how bad
scanners are with WebGoat for instance!

Smart Ass; This seems very sensible and a great approach (as always from you
IMHO) I do think though we need to be strongly biased towards code review in
development and strongly biased towards pen testing for implementation /
deployment. What do you think ?
