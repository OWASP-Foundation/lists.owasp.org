I came across this interesting paper
http://www.securenet.de/papers/Session_Riding.pdf which describes ways
to mount cross-attacks to web applications, termed "Session riding".
This was a few weeks ago, but then workload prevented me from writing
about this in a more timely fashion.

The idea is different from XSS, and amounts to send requests to a web
application
on behalf of a legitimate user, simply by tricking him into (for
example) visiting a specially crafted website. The interesting thing
is that no classical vulnerability is leveraged, since the whole stuff
simply relies on the fact that (usually) applications trust *all* user
requests. It turns out that there are plenty of ways to force silent
requests (such as IMG tags...), making this a real threat. Rather than
going through the whole article, and probably rendering a bad service
to the author, I recommend everybody to read it.

The idea goes back to an old post made in 2001 about "Cross-Site
Request Forgeries", which seems to have been so far largely forgotten.
I remember similar ideas about non-visible embedded images used to
track people behavior, but that was more related to privacy than
security.

I believe this should be covered by the testing methodology. Combined
with phishing and
other forms of social attacks it could prove a very dangerous threat.
Any thoughts on this?

Mauro

P.S. is anybody going to hang around black hat europe in amsterdam?

I've just got round to reading this paper again and i agree, it should 
be included in the 2nd phase.

Work hasn't totally stopped, I'm still working on it and will release a 
big update once the appsec conference is finished, next weekend.

Is anyone from this project going to it?
