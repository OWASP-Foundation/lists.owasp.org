Thanks Dan. 

I think Andrew was updating some missing sections. 

I would like to suggest the following. 

1. Andrew has until Friday morning updating / filling in as much as he can. 

2. I will then spend Friday covering anything else and send to this list. 

3. We can then all create an issues list (outside of the doc)

4. I will then setup a IM chat next week for final review to cover the
issues list.

5. We will then release the draft next Friday and I will send the draft to
the tech editor for preparation of final version.

I have a few concerns such as we all agreed that black box testing has
significant limitations yet the conclusion of that section seems to
contradict that. There are several other similar things but all can be
covered by consensus in the issues list.

I can read through 3B when Andrew is done and provide some suggestions
as well, I've previously done Code Review for a few years.

Can anyone, with the relevant experience, help with these sections?

Chapter 5, which techniques..
Since im bad at doing pie charts, could anyone rustle up one for this?

1A - SDLC Process Review

3B - Code Reviews
Armed with a good understanding of how the code is structured and why
certain things were coded the way they were, the tester can now examine
the actual code for security defects.


Thanks,

I got it fine.  I *think* however, that this is something similar to
what I've seen on other mailing lists.  It looks like Syed is getting
the digest version of the mailing list, and on other mailing lists I'm
on in digest mode, I've noticed that attachments never come through
correctly.  They put the content encoded inline in the email, and it of
course doesn't work.

I got it fine.  I *think* however, that this is something similar to
what I've seen on other mailing lists.  It looks like Syed is getting
the digest version of the mailing list, and on other mailing lists I'm
on in digest mode, I've noticed that attachments never come through
correctly.  They put the content encoded inline in the email, and it of
course doesn't work.

cool!

Dan, can I have the diagram "source", so I can start working in the Spanish translation as planned? Hope I can have it in 2 weeks or so, for writing review.

Thank you

It looks quite ok to me, I think it might be good to improve the text 
regarding the Workflow information, it might also be better to fill in 
the blank space between page 6 and 7.

How about this:

"The flow diagram below is based in several steps:

- The penetration test needs to start by gathering all possible 
information available information on the infraestructure and 
applications involved.

- The test should go through all the different phases described below

- An attempt should be done to exploit all vulnerabilities discovered 
in the application

- For all succesful exploitation of a vulnerability a risk should be 
done. Also, the information returned by some vulnerabilities, for 
example, programming errors, source code retrieved through them or 
other internal information disclosed should used to re-assess the 
known information of the application

- Finally, if at any point in time, a vulnerability is detected which 
can compromise the organisation's service or disclose 
business-critical internal information, the personnel responsible for 
the application should be contacted inmediately by issuing an "alert" 
(contacting them inmediately)
"

How does the above sound?


Regarding the workflow just a few comments:

a) The second step ("Go through each phase....") does not contain the 
full text.
b) The rhombus in the middle says "Have all attack methods has 
exhausted and investicated?" should say "Have all attack methods been 
exhausted and investigated?"
b) The rhombus to the end and right says "Is the information business 
criticle" should say "Is the information obtained business-critical?"


Sorry to be so nit-picking :-)

Regards

Javier

We love nit-picking.. it makes the doc so much better
Ill update the space with your comments and edit the workflow

Expect a new version tomorrow

I have written the section I took on, but I'm also filling in many missing
sections, and re-writing the IBM system sciences bit. Howard and LeBlanc
point to data from 

http://www.cybercrime.gov 

In particular:

http://www.cybercrime.gov/cccases.html

as actual figures for loss. I think it speaks for itself, so I'm including
it instead.

I am creating a bibiliography appendix. Please feed me references not
explicitly mentioned in the document.

It's Friday very <expletive> early for the US at the moment, so please
forgive me for not writing back already.

Andrew

Thanks Dan. 

I think Andrew was updating some missing sections. 

I would like to suggest the following. 

1. Andrew has until Friday morning updating / filling in as much as he can. 

2. I will then spend Friday covering anything else and send to this list. 

3. We can then all create an issues list (outside of the doc)

4. I will then setup a IM chat next week for final review to cover the
issues list.

5. We will then release the draft next Friday and I will send the draft to
the tech editor for preparation of final version.

I have a few concerns such as we all agreed that black box testing has
significant limitations yet the conclusion of that section seems to
contradict that. There are several other similar things but all can be
covered by consensus in the issues list.

hey all,

As promised here is an updated version.
There are still a few area's which need filling in, so could anyone with the
time/experience help out? (i need to get on with proper work for the next
couple of hours).


Cheers

Can someone after me make an executive decision to keep, delete or re-word

Soon!

There's several differing writing styles in play, and that needs to be
reduced to one for a cohesive document.

I'm going to normalize them against third party impersonal and change the
rhetorical questions to statements. The TOC will thank us.

I'm also reducing passive voice where it is practical to do so. 

I'm not against the passive voice, but often it makes little sense in a
"please do" document.

Don't forget, when we're done with this, we're hopefully going to get
this thing in front of a tech-writer.  They'll be able to do some more
of the basic grammar and giving one voice type changes as well.  The key
right now is to make sure the technical stuff is correct and on target
for the message we want to deliver.

Soon!

There's several differing writing styles in play, and that needs to be
reduced to one for a cohesive document.

I'm going to normalize them against third party impersonal and change
the rhetorical questions to statements. The TOC will thank us.

Agreed, there are some comments still which we all need to decide on the
outcome/output

Here's the latest draft. 
 
I've done quite a bit with editing, and filled in a many more sections. I've
referenced the two books I found as comments, but there's more to make a
complete reference.
 
I'm fairly unhappy with Chapter 4. It's not consistent with the rest of the
guide, and really doesn't explain the Testing Explained at all. It's
internally inconsistent, and doesn't really help people who aren't using
RUP. RUP is not mentioned elsewhere in the guide, and it repeats itself. I
would like to see a shorter chapter which essentially:
 

*	Intro 

*	Types of reviews 


*	Requirements Review 

*	Design / Architectural Spike Review 

*	Code Review 

*	Functional testing (ie unit testing) 

*	Penetration Testing

*	When to conduct reviews

It would be a shorter and more useful chapter after that re-write.
 
I think Chapter 8 should be moved closer to the front of the document.
 
Please go nuts.
 
thanks,
Andrew

Sorry for the flood of posts; this is the last one before I go to bed (it's
1.36 am)... 

The Pentest doco still has double spacing and I forgot to remove them in my
edits due to the lateness of the hour and the fact that beer o'clock was
some time ago. Word processors != mono space typewriters. Font designers
spend literally hundreds of hours kerning font pairs correctly. Can someone
remove them?

Thanks,
Andrew

Hey all,

Over the past 3 weeks i've added a fair amount of people to the 
owasp-testing list.
The aim of this list is not to sit back and watch a select handful of 
people do all the work, but to actively commit to helping the various 
testing projects we have going.

We have the testing guide phase two which i've recently sent out an 
updated outline of where i feel we should concentrate one, yet only the 
regulars have commented.

If you are looking at helping, please join in and offer some comments 
or help with the documents. If you are looking for the documents before 
everyone else gets them, please join webappsec at securityfocus.com and 
wait till we release them.

Any comments, let me know

Daniel

I'm one of the new members on the list. I took my time as I wanted to 
get familiar with your discussions, and thought it'd be best to wait for 
Phase 2 to kick off in ardent.  It's been 3 weeks? :) wow! sorry!

fwiw, let me also forward a mail I'd sent when you'd first shared the 
outline - I wasn't yet part of this group id then.

Thanks, and look forward to working with y'all.

I have to say it looks great to me. One question though, in one of the 
workflow tests it says "... should used to re-assess ..." shouldn't it 
be " should _be_ used to re-assess ....". Also, not all of the steps 
are finished with a period (only the last one), is this a style I'm 
not aware of?

Thanks for all the work!

Javier

Date: Mon, 5 Jul 2004 14:14:17 +0200
Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Testing Part 2 Outline questions
Message-ID: <003b01c46289$9e1870e0$8b00a8c0@BART>

Hi all,

The Pentest Checklist lists a few checks to be performed that more or less
map to those on the ouline of the Part 2 document. Is this meant to be
synchronized in some way or is the checklist a separate document - I read
somewhere that the checklist might become an Appendix to the Part2 document,
just how much of an independent document is it and should the P2 document be
shaped around the pentest checklist (or the other way around)?

A few comments on the P2 outline (rev 0.3):

Configuration Management Infrastructure
---------------------------------------
- I would add "Reviewing virtual hosts configuration", this is something
listed in the Pentest checklist, but missing from the Phase2 outline.

Configuration Management Application
------------------------------------
- "Process permissions" will be related to OS functionalities such as the
user that is running the webserver/applications, doing privilege/process
space separation, etc. Are we going to include here things such as running
in chroot()ed environments, using host-based security (grsec, etc...), at
least as a reference or is this outside the scope of the document?

Input injection
---------------
I would add double "url-decoding" (e.g. %252e)

Buffer overflow
---------------
I understand this has to be a basic introduction to the various scenarios
where overflows could turn into vulnerabilities. If so, I would add "Heap
management bugs (free() / malloc() bugs)"

I think that most of the testing will be at two levels: Infrastructure (web
server, environment, application server... - mostly related to configuration
management) and Application (authentication, parameter manipulation... -
mostly related to problems within the actual development of the
application). Although some of the subjects may overlap (for instance
session management can be performed by the underlying platform or the
application itself) I think it would be to our advantage to clearly separate
both levels: first give guidelines on how to test the underlying platform,
without taking into account the actual application running on top of it,
then provide tests for the application, assuming the underlying platform has
been properly reviewed. The outline is mostly structured in sections that
relate to the infrastructure or application levels, it is just a matter of
shifting them around.

This approach could be also useful when we come down to the Application side
of the document. I would start at the basic checks (input filtering,
parameter normalization...) and move up from there, so that things at a
higher level (e.g. directory traversal) do not have to include references to
it. Let me give you an example with directory traversal:

When checking for directory traversal, you can (arguably) just check for
"../". But the parameter can also be url-encoded, or encoded using unicode,
or have non-normalized paths ("e.g. ././//..//), etc. If we got input
filtering/parameter normalization out of the way before talking about
directory traversal, the description and readability could be greatly
simplified.

More on document scope: HTTP is a huge protocol, and most of the protocol
processing can be performed by the underlying platform or the application
itself. Just how much do we want to get into those? For instance we could
write on Transfer-Encoding manipulation (badly-formed chunk data) or MIME
parsing (multipart form submissions) which are usually taken care of by the
platform - but then some technologies leave it up to the application (CGI
comes to mind). What is the general feeling on where (if at all) should we
draw a line? (my personal opinion is to assume a high-level platform and
forget about low-level nightmares, focusing on the non-protocol related
development problems).

If this has been already discussed let me know, I am new to the list and
have spent just a moderate time reading through the archives :)

Cheers,

Lluis
.

hi,

Initially the pentest checklist was started out of a need to have some
kind of document which would make the auditors happy and also provide some
record to people doing the tests of what has been done and what was
missed.
At some point it will become an appendix to the testing guide, but for the
meantime i feel it's useful on its own.

The idea of splitting the doc into infrastructure and application has been
raised and i can see how this would benefit the document.

Thanks for the comments, i'll add them to the outline and send an updated
version towards the end of the week.

There are three list styles in common use:

* Foo;
* Blah; and
* Thingy.

* Foo
* Blah
* Thingy.

* Foo.
* Blah.
* Thingy.

The first is a formal English style, but requires the bullet items to be
coherent sentences in list form. The last is very common when bullets are
used instead of paragraphs. 

I like the middle style for its bare minimalism, particularly when the
bullets are not necessarily full sentences or paragraphs.

I have to say it looks great to me. One question though, in one of the 
workflow tests it says "... should used to re-assess ..." shouldn't it 
be " should _be_ used to re-assess ....". Also, not all of the steps 
are finished with a period (only the last one), is this a style I'm 
not aware of?

Thanks for all the work!

Javier

Daniel,

Just a quick comment, I hope it's not too late.

The NIST 800-30 document is at (version 2002) 
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html#sp800-30

If you want the January 2004 draft, its 
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/SP800-30-RevA-draft.pdf

(This link will probably expire soon since the deadline for sending 
comments expired in March 20, 2004)

And could you include the title of the NIST document in the footnote 
where you put the link?
The title is "Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems"

---------

I caught an error in the User Authentication part.
The item number 10 has errors, Ref. number should be, "OWASP-AUTHN-0010" 
and the objective should be "Ensure that passwords are not _blank_" not 
_black_ :o)

----

In configuration management I think the objective for "OWASP-CM-003" 
should be changed to, "Ensure that all vendor patches for known 
vulnerabilities are applied."

-----

In the data protection part, OWASP-DP-004, add to objective, "vulnerable 
to the Man-In-The-Middle attack"

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] testing project part 1 - threat modeling
Message-ID: <40E987E3.9020108@opencs.com.br>

Howard and Le Blanc's book on secure coding writes explicitly why UML 
isn't a good choice for deposing the application being analyzed.

Is there any reason as to why UML was "chosen"? Wouldn't it be better to 
talk about Data Flow Datagrams that seems to be the standard modeling 
tool when modeling flow of data.

I don't for example agree with Use Case models being the best way to 
decompose an application being analyzed. It is handy to model what you 
want the application to do in the analysis phase but more information is 
needed when doing threat analysis (that's my opinion at least)

When modeling something within a time frame you have the sequence 
diagram from UML fitting perfectly.

As a commercial for DFD, it says at msdn, "Data flow diagrams (DFDs) and 
sequence diagrams can help with the formal decomposition of a system. A 
DFD is a graphical representation of data flows, data stores, and 
relationships between data sources and destinations. A sequence diagram 
shows how a group of objects collaborate in terms of chronological events.

(http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/securecode/threatmodeling/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/thcmch03.asp)

There is another approach called Misuse/Abuse Cases, using the use cases 
made in the analysis phase to try abusing the system on a design level. 
This is great but I still think you need more information to do a fully 
threat analysis than is available on the design level.

There is some literature available on this, like:

http://www.computer.org/security/v2n3/bsi.htm
http://www.martinfowler.com/distributedComputing/abuse.pdf
http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/ftpdir/reports/YCS-2004-375.pdf (paper)

Mads,

The reason I mentioned UML is simple - most developers are now familiar with
it, and it is often all they can give me (if they have any doco at all). 

I take your point, though. Maybe there is no one "good" method except to say
that decomposing an application is essential. 

Abuse cases are interesting. They are like negative test artifacts. It
deserves an inclusion. 

Would you like to re-write the chapter? I think that is probably the best
way to get a workable consensus.

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] testing project part 1 - threat modeling

Howard and Le Blanc's book on secure coding writes explicitly why UML 
isn't a good choice for deposing the application being analyzed.

Is there any reason as to why UML was "chosen"? Wouldn't it be better to 
talk about Data Flow Datagrams that seems to be the standard modeling 
tool when modeling flow of data.

I don't for example agree with Use Case models being the best way to 
decompose an application being analyzed. It is handy to model what you 
want the application to do in the analysis phase but more information is 
needed when doing threat analysis (that's my opinion at least)

When modeling something within a time frame you have the sequence 
diagram from UML fitting perfectly.

As a commercial for DFD, it says at msdn, "Data flow diagrams (DFDs) and 
sequence diagrams can help with the formal decomposition of a system. A 
DFD is a graphical representation of data flows, data stores, and 
relationships between data sources and destinations. A sequence diagram 
shows how a group of objects collaborate in terms of chronological events.

(http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/securecode/threatmodeling/default.aspx?p
ull=/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/thcmch03.asp)

There is another approach called Misuse/Abuse Cases, using the use cases 
made in the analysis phase to try abusing the system on a design level. 
This is great but I still think you need more information to do a fully 
threat analysis than is available on the design level.

There is some literature available on this, like:

http://www.computer.org/security/v2n3/bsi.htm
http://www.martinfowler.com/distributedComputing/abuse.pdf
http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/ftpdir/reports/YCS-2004-375.pdf (paper)

More or less Mark, in my understanding, abuse cases try to break the 
system based on the use case design, that is on the design level. You 
might call it a security minded alternative path but I like the term 
because it is explicitly security related.
You force the designer to think of what the system must not accept in 
terms of security, I don't think you can have a negative alternative 
path in the same case?

Another point however is that Threat Modeling should consider other 
levels of the system, not just the design level where use cases lives.

That would be cool Mark, like the "OWASP Threat Modeling Guide" :o)
That is certainly not a bad idea! but let finish off the current version

What are the steps from now?, you want a revision of the current doc? I 
found some spelling errors, what would be the best way to submit those?

Do you want them?

The document is already full of revisions, I think it would be better to 
submit pagenumber, line and text in an email, agreed?

Message-ID: <55825.194.203.201.168.1089702918.squirrel@194.203.201.168>

hey all,

I was working on the 2nd phase last night (adding all the sections that
everyone has said need to be added) and it got me thinking about the
possibility of including a cheat sheet.

The idea:
You have the OWASP pentest checklist, so why not have a document which
lists the most common things to test (dir traversal with all the various
encoding tricks/SQL injection strings/commands etc)

Does anyone use anything like this at the moment?
I have a very muddled up collection of scribbles but nothing that would
make sense to anyone and i think that this would be a worthwhile addition
to the OWASP testing guide.

Comments/examples appreciated.

Daniel

Hi all,

I like the idea but what about having that as part of the 2nd phase
contents? At the end of each section a "things to test" subsection - like
this it can be easily related to the in-depth discussion of the
vulnerability that (I assume) will be part of that section and can be more
easily mantained than a separate document.

I think a way forward (even before we have the definitive list of sections)
could be to write up one of the sections, so that we agree on the content of
the section. What about something along the lines of:

  1. Vulnerability overview (short version)
  2. Why/when it happens?
  3. In-depth technical vulnerability description
  4. How to test for it
  5. Drawbacks of the testing (things that can go untested / things that can
not be tested)
  6. "Thing to test" / "Things to try"
  7. How to solve it? (Is this outside the scope of the "testing" group?)
  ...?

If we agree on this I would pick up a not-so-widely published/discussed
vulnerability (e.g. not SQL injection or XSS) to try and test the content
structure fits us.

Cheers,

Lluis

This is pretty much the direction i was going

When we have the final structure decided, im going to put out the call for
everyone to pick a section they want to write on, and it will take the
form of your description below.

So say SQL injection:

1. Vulnerability overview (short version)
2. Why/when it happens?
3. In-depth technical vulnerability description
4. How to test for it
5. Drawbacks of the testing (things that can go untested / things that can
not be tested)
6. "Thing to test" / "Things to try"

As for fixing it, i think at the start of the doc it does state that the
OWASP guide to building secure webapps should be used as well.

I think Lluis's idea is excelent. The outline above seems to me to be a 
good layout for the document. Maybe section 3 and 4 should be merged, 
this way you could submit to a more "teacher" writing style, mentioning 
the vulnerability in details and showing how to test for it side by side.
We probably _should_ include a "how to solve it" section or annex but it 
could be done in another version or document.

I am sorry to say I haven't had much time to look at the outline Daniel 
posted some time back. Will try to catch up and send comments

Are we all using the word 'testing' to include code review?  And would
section 4 be split somehow to cover both?

I think references to "how to solve it" -- like pointers to the Guide would
be pretty helpful.

totally, there is no need to duplicate any of the work done by the owasp
guide team, so i feel there should be pointers instead of actual howto's

as for code review, it does have a place and should cover both

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] pentest cheat sheet
In-Reply-To: <032701c46907$ee8ef3d0$2301a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>
Message-ID: <000901c4692b$344ae410$4500a8c0@BART>

Hi all,

I was not particularly thinking on code review (more on the external audit
side of things), but I can see how we can split section 4 (and probably 5)
for both ways of approaching the "testing".

I see section 6 ("Things to test/try") as an "external audit" kind of thing,
although we could add a "Things to look for in the code" when coming to code
review.

A sample of what a section covering "Cross-site scripting" might look like
(Ok, I did chose an easy one, blame me :) this is not meant to be complete
or technically correct, just to see if we agree on what the content of each
subsection (4,5,6 and 7?) could be and whether to split them or not):

4. How to test for it
=====================

4a. During code review
----------------------
Find input data from the client that gets directly output back to the
client, with no previous filtering or encoding.
Find dynamic data output to the client that is based on information provided
by the client itself (take into account that this can be information
provided in the very same request or information retrieved from permanent
storage - e.g. a database). Keep track of input variables, where (and how)
they are stored in every part of the application that deals with them.
[...]

4b. During an "external audit"
------------------------------
Look for data provided by the remote client that gets output back by the
application (this could be any part of the request, but particularly look
for input variables -GET,POST- and cookies). A good way to test for them is
to browse the remote website using a "keyword" on all date fed to the
application. After that review find if that "keyword" shows up in any
response from the server, which will lead you to a good starting point to a
possible XSS vulnerability.
[...]

5. Drawbacks of the testing
===========================
It is easy to spot "direct" XSS vulnerabilities, where the input to an
application gets output by the application on the same transaction where it
is received. Applications that store the provided data into a permanent
storage (e.g. database) and later on use it in output to the client are
harder to test (note: for the time being I will use the "indirect XSS
vulnerability" term to describe them, for lack of a better name).
[...]

5a. During code review
----------------------
One of the ways to test for "indirect XSS" is to follow the application
logic to determine what is actually done with the client input and make sure
that either on the way in it gets filtered or on the way out it gets
encoded. This might involve a large amount of work and there is not probably
an automated way to do it, so it is easy for one of these vulnerabilities to
slip through. A good approach is to make the data provided by the user
"tainted" and make sure it is either properly validated during input or
encoded on output.
[...]

5b. During an "external audit"
------------------------------
Finding "indirect XSS" vulnerabilities while performing an external audit is
directly related to the amount of time we spend interacting with the
application and the number of functionalities we access. It is usually
prohibitive/impossible to interact with the application in every single
possible way, which is the only way to spot them all, so code review is a
better option to test for these kind of vulnerabilities (note: I am afraid
this is probably going to show up all over the document :).
[...]

6. "Things to test in an external audit"
----------------------------------------
  http://www.example.org/application?data=<script>alert('hi')</script>
[...]

7. "Things to look for in the code"
-----------------------------------
  - Output of variables provided by the client (e.g.: print $_GET["data"])
[...]

What do you think of the structure and kind of content for each subsection?
I feel as if we were missing something important here, can anybody think of
more subsections?

Cheers,

Lluis

That's a good idea. Actually, that's what we started writting for the 
testing guide last year. All the info is currently sitting (unused) in 
the CVS, it's also far from complete:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/owasp/testing/

The outline looks great to me. My only concern is that the last time 
we tried this we did not cover all the vulnerabilities we wanted to 
(not everyone did their homework). So maybe it's better to do first a 
generic overview of the common vulnerabilities in section 6 and then 
provide examples for specific vulnerabilities (i.e. those we can write 
down stuff for following your outline). So the section might say 
"Below you will find some examples of vulnerabilities and how they 
should be tested as well as their known caveats"

IF we are able to cover all the vulnerabilities as defined in the 
Pentest checklist then we can scratch the reference to those sections 
being examples and substitute that with a "Below you will find a list 
of all known common vulnerabilities and how test should be conducted 
to detect them as well as known caveats"

Javier

This is one of my biggest concerns.
Since ive been on this guide for a long time now, ive seen the sections go
out for everyone to write and only a handful of people actually deliver
their section back complete.

Seriously, i understand that everyone has jobs/lifes/wives/husbands/cars/
etc, but if you feel you dont have the time to donate please let me know!

When I hear "cheat sheet" I always think something like a single page with
high level tasks.

If you're anything like me (ie terrible memory, particularly prior to the
first coffee), a single page "what to do next" is really handy.

Check out the Visio diagram I quickly mocked up. A4 paper is a bit bigger,
let's us have a few more bubbles :)

A few more areas that we could add in the Testing Part 2 Outline are:

In the Authentication section:

1. Vulnerable Remember password implementation

Check for cases where the password itself is stored as a persistent 
cookie, or the token given assigned for remembering passwords is never 
reset and becomes as powerful as the password itself in plain text.

2. Weak "forgot password" implementations
Check for vulnerabilities like "weak hint question", "displaying 
original password to the user" and other design-level weaknesses

and in the Data Protection section:

3. Sensitive data in persistent cookies
Check for passwords, and other user sensitive information stored in 
persistent cookies

4. Sensitive data in URLs
Check for account information etc, turning up in the "History" of the 
browser even after the user has logged off.

Another thing to add could be "Weak encryption":

Check for data that aparently looks random but is not (not just the
session-id, but also reversible encoding of passwords stored in cookies,
etc.), faulty homemade encryption algorithms and so on. Present a general
way on how to test this: gather various """encrypted""" data, try to find
similarities between them and so on.

Just my two cents

IMHO "positive" approaches are better than "negative", please use it while building this guide. for example suggest tests to confirm proper session handling not to look for session hijack problem.

Security community is full of this kind of "negative" approaches (Always looking for bad implementations), let's make this guide different by teaching how to look for proper implementations and let people learn how to implement a solution, rather than how to avoid all kind of problems.

I hope I could show my point.

Best regards

Wouldn't that be difficult when there're more than one right (secure) way to implement a feature? For instance, to mitigate the risk of brute force password guessing, "account lockout" strategies could be implemented in different ways (lock out for a set duration, force the user to type a random word etc.) depending on the need of the business. Wouldn't checking for a vulnerability be better in that case?

Since we are finally checking whether the application is exposed to a risk or not, I think there is always a negative element. I'm not sure whether it's better to take a positive approach checking for the right implementation, or the negative approach checking for a vulnerability to verify the risk.

Thanks!

Morning all,

I'm in the process of going through a heavy period at work and i promise i
will get out an updated structure outline by the end of next week.

Hopefully this will be close to the final version so i will be able to
start dividing it up and everyone can start work on their sections.

updates and publish content directly from their browsers. It rocks and rocks
hard !

Every project leader will be responsible for maintaining an up to date and
accurate project page
Every Chapter chair will be responsible for maintaining an accurate and up
to date Chapter home page
The OWASP Leaders collectively will take care of the rest of the site
Mads you can create your resources section with pages for links, whitepapers
and tools using this

It is everyone's responsibility to check spelling and grammar before
publishing. 

We will be creating templates for as much possible so that you just need to
complete sections of the template and hit publish. 

In order to use the system you will need an account on the CMS. To obtain an
account you must send your name, the reason you need an account (I run the
Ireland Chapter) and a STATIC IP address. If you do not have an static IP
address you can not use the system at present and will need to hand over
your responsibilities to someone else. 

To obtain an account you should email larry.casey at aspectsecurity.com (Do No
Mail or CC Me!)

We will setup an IM on Friday for basic Magnolia training. Watch for the
invite.

If you do not request an account by Friday we will auto-assign your sections
to someone else. If you do not create your pages by next Monday we will also
be forced to do so. This should take no one more that 30 mins. Sorry for the
harshness but we need to do some spring cleaning ;-)

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Contributors Credits for Part 1
Message-ID: <200407271538.LAA29571@leviathan.cnchost.com>

If you have ever contributed to the OWASP Testing Guide Part 1 and want to
be credited please speak up now. 

You should send me a mail with the contribution you made before the end of
the week so I can add your name.

If it was text please highlight it in the document. 
If it was review or discussion then please send me a mail with the link to
the mail archives.

The only reward for this work is credit and we want to make sure we give
credit where credit is due to your hard work and expertise and not credit
other people with your hard work !

Larry Shields and I have reviewed what we have so far and decided (with
advice from the tech writer) that we need to heavily edit Chapters 4, 5 and
6. As it stands this doc doesn't convey the high level message we intended.
It delves between high level and more detailed context and is contradictory
in places. That text will be great stuff for Part 2 so it wont be wasted. 

In the sole purpose of getting this out Larry and I will be meeting in
person tomorrow to get it finished.  

You will all (those who contributed) have a chance to vote for approval
before it is finally released. Well send the final copy out before the
weekend closes.

Cheers

Message-ID: <7274FE6068F1DE49B8AA0258E92C5A3C021B9805@shasta.foundstone.com>

Can someone please send me the great work (I forget who did it)?on black box testing session management / session tokens? I would like to add it as an Appendix to Part 1 of an example of what will be coming in Part 2.

I spent time today reworking the main chapters about techniques (manual inspections, code review, threat modeling and pen testing). This was because when we read through it as a whole document after the tech editor had his wicked way, some sections were just far to detailed for this document. They will all be able to be re-purposed for Part 2 so its certainly not lost work.

Larry and I will be updating Chapter 2 and the final Framework Chapter tomorrow and we hope to then have a final draft for you all to review by the end of the week.

Finally we maybe able to release this next week! Yippee.

Cheers,


Mark

PS What is the status of Part 2? Who is working on what? Is there a "table of contents"?

there is a table of contents due to be posted by me as soon as i get 
this work load out of the way.
Im hoping this will be approved by everyone so we can then start 
working on assigning the sections and getting the structure done

Sorry for the delay on this, damn normal jobs :0(

It seems to be going the same way as the OASIS WAS project.

I think we need to concentrate on making sure the various languages are
covered. I had a good chat with a friend over at another large investment
bank and he wanted to know what we were doing with J2EE stuff, hence this
has now been added.

Once everyone is happy with what is in the outline, i'll draw up a better
format and then we can start assigning sections for people to get on with.

There are a large amount of people on this list now and yet only a few
regulars still seem to offer comments. I will be removing the inactive

use it as a private guide before the rest of the world get it..)

;-)

OASIS WAS is 

-at an official standards body (not a vendor consortium)
-is being early adopted by several major banks (inc Fidelity) as a risk
management classification scheme
-provides a risk ranking model
-includes (and will include further) classification about code level issues
with the input of people like Fortify and Ounce)
-and was TRULY derived with industry input (WAS TC inlcudes Cisco, Visa, HP,
IBM etc)
-is a subset on an xml schema that has seen a lot of interest from MITRE and
the analysts

Remember we did the ASAC over 4 years ago ! 

Better to lead than follow ;-)

Dan,

A couple of ideas that might be worth thinking about are;

1. Provide generic methodologies for code review, pen testing , manual
review etc as outlined in the Part 1 (Nish and Hari started this with their
sections). These would basically outline "here is how to do a web app pen
test- first profile site, then look for potential issues, then exploit them
etc...obviously much more detailed and just a pseudo example). We already
have a good start with this in Nish, Hari and other work that can be
re-purposed.
2. Organize the actual implementation of these methodologies around the SDLC
tasks we proposed in Part 1.  This ensures we cover how to test requirements
and design and don't just produce a pen test methodology and low level guide
for pen testing. I that that would be fine but we should call it out as that
as an compliment to the pen test check list if that is what we really want
to do ?
3. Merging Part 1 into Part 2 to get one big testing guide. At that point
Part 1 would no longer be stand-alone.

One of the things we found in the OWASP Guide 2.0 re-write was it became
much easier to call out the language specific stuff such as J2EE and C# into
an appendix.

Maybe we could do that here, ie Appendix A - Finding Specific Vulns by Code
Review, Appendix B - Finding Specific Vulns by Pen testing, Finding Specifi
Vulns by Design Review

The advantage of this is an appendix doesn't have to be complete and judging
by the length of time it took to get to Part 1, it would be far easier to
get the core of the doc (the methodologies themselves) completed and then
update Apendixes frequently. By gut estimate is the size of Part 2 will b 20
times the size of part 1, or 56 years ;-)

The overall structure would look like

Introduction
Principles of Testing
Testing Techniques Explained (overview)
OWASP Testing Framework
Methodologies
	Manual Inspections
	Penetration Testing
	Code Review
	Threat Modeling

Appendix A - Finding Specific Issues using Manual Inspection
	Design Reviews
	Policy Reviews
	Threat Modeling
	Requirements Analysis

Appendix B - Finding Specific Vulnerabilities using Penetration Testing
	SQL Injection
	XSS
	Buffer Overflows
	Weak Passwords
	Session Management
Appendix C - Finding Specific Vulnerabilities using Source Code Review
	SQL Injection
	Weak Key Generation
	
Apendix D - Testing Tools
Appendix X etc

Some how this needs to be tied to using these techniques at the right stages
of the SDLC so people stop pen testing before deployment. Maybe the
framework itself is OK for that.

Thoughts ?

I like the idea of the Appendix as i really dont want to repeat the issues
we had with Phase 1.

Is anyone here comfortable with J2EE testing (i have to admit ive not
really looked at it but feel its needed)
Ill update the outline with the format mentioned below and send it out

Do you mean things like testing the security manager setup and access
modifiers on methods or more specific things around breaking into servlet
implementations and EJB's etc ?

I think both would make sense, one fits into code review and the other pen
test

Message-ID: <20040729200912.1262.qmail@web54108.mail.yahoo.com>

[I'm posting from a different address since my
address mauro.bregolin at tiscali.it was rejected as
its SMTP server was in the "Spamcop RBL"...
guess I should change provider]
------------------------------------------------------

Hi to all,

I'm one of the relatively recently added folks who
have 
yet to contribute (needless to say, I was hit by
Murphy's law and swamped by work as soon as I
subscribed to the list...)

Now, feeling guilty:

1. Comments on testing guide

I found the guide a bit unbalanced.
I think there are different assumptions when you write
something addressed to both when you have control over
the software development life cycle and when you test
something already developed by others.
In the first case, test is a part of the development
process and is under control. You should have
documentation about requirements, architecture/design,
code, etc.; your test cases should have been prepared 
according to established test plans in order to verify
adherence to requirements (including security).
Now, talking about things like "software development
life cycle", "threat models", "code reviews", etc. is 
risky because there are tons of books which do this.
I'm not saying it's wrong, but it's difficult to do it
without being too naive, or simplistic.
For example, UML is one of the prominent (if not
"the") 
modeling methodology in use nowadays, but it's not the
only one.
It's difficult to summarize good testing practices
in a few pages, when others have wrote piles of books
on the subject.
Things are perhaps a bit simpler with grey/black box
testing, where not much information is available, or
even with white box testing when performed
afterwards by external people (in the sense that only 
available documentation is considered; you are somehow

constrained by what others have written/produced).
Just my 2c on the topic...

2. Contribution for part 2
I was wondering if you deem of interest inserting in 
part two some "case studies".
With this I mean real-life situations worth of being
thoroughly explained/analyzed.
Personally I have one related to SQL Injection, which 
is in my opinion good to show the dangers lying in 
seemingly minimal exposures.
Briefly stated, I found several examples (all at 
prominent organizations!) of SQL injection 
vulnerabilities in authentication-related forms which 
unfortunately granted no output to control where to
"union" data fetched from the DBMS via the injected 
query. Moreover, the DBMS involved (DB2, Oracle)
didn't 
allow fancy things like statement concatenation, nor
the invocation of a plethora of stored procedures like
MS SQL Server does.
The only available indication regarding the injection
was a binary condition, essentially whether the query 
produced an empty versus a non-empty result set.
Admittedly, not much, but enough to fetch data at
will.
I coded a little java application to automate the 
process of submitting injected requests (may provide 
the code as well if that's considered helpful),
with the result of:
a) automatically determining database schema
information (table, columns, datatypes etc.),
b) fetching data at will - compatibly with the DBMS
account privileges.
In two cases determining the schema allowed to spot a
table where credential where stored - in clear, which 
allowed to grab them and access the service with 
arbitrary credentials.
Needles to say, clients were quite impressed when they

saw it...

Let me know what you think...

Mauro,

This is great feedback. You are clearly a developer who speaks about
requirements and architecture and how testing (non-security) is or should be
a part of the developers life. This is exactly what we IMHO need to get
across in this project. A lot of the security community (even application
pen testers) are not from development backgrounds so are more familiar with
pen testing. If we all agree that testing should be part of the development
process then it needs to work with the other testing that is done such as
functional testing and regression testing etc . 

What this project set out to do was to help people build their own testing
program as a whole (holistic view) and understand what and how to test for
certain issues is a part of that.

FYI Part 1 was really meant to instill a simple high level management
message. To build a testing program there are a lot of techniques including
code review, manual inspection etc. Don't just think of testing as testing
deployed applications and pen testing. You need to test people, policy,
process AND technology. 

Part 2 will flesh that out into hard fast suggestions such as how to test
for SQL injection. 

The point of the above and SQL injection is a good one I think. If you see
in the design there were no data validation boundaries defined and then
parameterized stored procs were not used, you pretty much know you will have
a sql injection issue before you touch the code or pen test. If you look in
code and see dynamic queries being built of of url params again you know you
have an issue. You don't need a pen testers to stumble on the table names
;-) In your example below it sounds like you found this issue in code and
then proved it with pen testing. Is that right ?

------------------------------------------------------

Hi to all,

I'm one of the relatively recently added folks who have yet to contribute
(needless to say, I was hit by Murphy's law and swamped by work as soon as I
subscribed to the list...)

Now, feeling guilty:

1. Comments on testing guide

I found the guide a bit unbalanced.
I think there are different assumptions when you write something addressed
to both when you have control over the software development life cycle and
when you test something already developed by others.
In the first case, test is a part of the development process and is under
control. You should have documentation about requirements,
architecture/design, code, etc.; your test cases should have been prepared
according to established test plans in order to verify adherence to
requirements (including security).
Now, talking about things like "software development life cycle", "threat
models", "code reviews", etc. is risky because there are tons of books which
do this.
I'm not saying it's wrong, but it's difficult to do it without being too
naive, or simplistic.
For example, UML is one of the prominent (if not
"the")
modeling methodology in use nowadays, but it's not the only one.
It's difficult to summarize good testing practices in a few pages, when
others have wrote piles of books on the subject.
Things are perhaps a bit simpler with grey/black box testing, where not much
information is available, or even with white box testing when performed
afterwards by external people (in the sense that only available
documentation is considered; you are somehow

constrained by what others have written/produced).

Mauro,

I'm hoping your able to give your input and experience with the 2nd 
phase of the testing doc
Your development background would really add a valued background

I'll be updating the outline for the 2nd phase this weekend and will 
include you on the list

Cheers

Daniel

Hi Simon,

I have never liked, or will, the idea of a IDS thinking about performing
any defence mechanism on the network without some human checking to see if
its ok.
A while ago when i was pentesting a load of networks, i managed to
discover that Realsecure was running with the infamous "if you see bad
traffic, add a firewall rule" option. The end result was me adding a load
of rules which cut this whole segment off from the web and ended up
closing down their online trading app for an hour.

I believe that accounts should be locked out after X amount of failed
logins. Without this feature enabled, the app is very open to abuse
attacks.
I do agree though that both of them do contradict themselves, and i
realised this when i was putting the whole checklist together, but in some
weird way they need to be both there.

Mark,

I agree with your remarks on the typical background of
security
professionals (which is, in my opinion, a limitation).
Yes I come from a sw development background; in the
mid 90s
I worked at a company which acquired SEI CMM level 3
certification.
Then it happened that I switched to security; and when
the company I was
working for at the time was taken over by ISS and
became ISS Italy,
I managed ISS security assessment services for the
italian market
(that was 2001-2003; it might be that we were actually
co-workers
for some time, though Italy was somehow at the margins
of the picture
for ISS worldwide...).

Concerning SQL Injection, actually those
vulnerabilities were
found and exploited during pen tests (all of them).
In my experience, clients are not very keen in having
grey/white
box assessments, not to mention let you snoop through
their code.
I'm not saying they don't do this, but usually when we
were
called in it was for pen test or application
assessments black-box
style.
People dealing with security - the guys who called us
- usually managed deployed applications;
intervening in the SDLC is somehow harder for an
external organization,
partly because one tends to "wash dirty laundry at
home", as an
italian saying puts it.
Maybe others have different experiences...

Team,

I am taking a 3 month sabbatical from OWASP to take care of some other
higher priorities (work and personal) in my life. 

I will still complete the Testing Project Part 1 by next Friday with Larry
Shields.

Jeff Williams (Chair) can answer any questions you may have mailed me for in
the past. Jeff.Williams at owasp.org

See you all in 3 months !

Mark

Daniel,

I'll be glad to help.
Actually I'll be on vacation most of August, hope that
won't be
a problem with the project schedule.

ciao

Mauro

P.S. I remember someone complained in the past about
attachments,
I have the same problem - they appear as raw base64
data and I
have to manually convert them to get the final
document.
