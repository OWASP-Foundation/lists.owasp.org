Subject: [Owasp-testing] Risk Rating and Accountability
Message-ID: <CAFm0_my_++h2Z+D9_RXmXq8LKoZ6h7K+EL=TO8PoUXLF9_iTrw@mail.gmail.com>

How are you evaluating Accountability for Technical Impact?

I see the formula, but right now what I'm doing is using a taxonomy for
asset type where I define a security requirement for CIA and then decrement
that value by full/partial/none in CIA impacts for CVSS so a full keeps the
requirement value (say a 9 for finance server C score) where a none
decrements that down to 0.

There are 2 issues with this approach, should i avg or max these 3 scores?
An avg might drop the CIA overall risk down to . 3 while reduces the entire
aggregate score, while a max would keep this at a 9. However that also
means 3 9's evaluates the same as 1 9 which isn't great either.

And how do to best evaluate accountability? That's not something I can
easily extract from NVD data set.
