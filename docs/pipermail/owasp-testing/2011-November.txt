Hello,

I am searching for firefox 7 compatible add/edit cookie extension. Is
anyone here could point me? I found the existing extension is
compatible only with previous version of Firefox.

Thanks!

Has there been any movement on this? I still don't see a v4 draft section on owasp.org anywhere.

Matteo, can you open/start the OWASP testing guide v4 wiki draft for a collaborative edit?

Rick,

Your argument makes a lot of senses. Yea, if it is a common numbering scheme then the document code seems redundant.

Its stalled in my court.  I worked on it to get the 2 biggest sections 2,
received lots of great feedback from Colin Watson that I need to think hard
about/address and it got stuck there. I'm not sure if I have the cycles to
finish this and its been stuck for like 6 months.

If someone else wants to take a crack at the next section or work with me to
address Colin's comments and then work on the next section I'd probably be
able to help with guidance and review but I won't have the cycles for a
while to pick this up again.

Hi Zaki,
I recommend you to use Cookie Manager+. Indeed we replaced one by the other
in the Samurai WTF Firefox add-on collection last week:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/rsiles/samurai/
