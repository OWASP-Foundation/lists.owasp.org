Hi Guys,

Is there an updated TODO list?

I think this was the last to be sent out?

Thanks,

I have updated:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Conduct_search_engine_discovery/reconnaissance_for_information_leakage_(OTG-INFO-001)

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_Application_Platform_Configuration_(OTG-CONFIG-002)


and created first drafts for:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weaker_authentication_in_alternative_channel_(OTG-AUTHN-010)

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_defenses_against_application_mis-use_(OTG-BUSLOGIC-011)

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_time_synchronisation_(OTG-LOG-001)

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_user-viewable_log_of_authentication_events_(OTG-LOG-002)

If you don't want a Logging section, I think LOG-001 could be moved to
Business Logic Testing, and LOG-002 to Authentication Testing.  Note
that logging is also discussed in OTG-CONFIG-002.

I wasn't sure if I got the default headings correct as there seems to
be some differences across the tests. And I may not be consistent with
my use of "website", "web application" and "application". The case of
some test names is not always the same - some sentence case and some
title case, and I wondered if its worth tidying this up before it gets
too late.

At AppSec EU this year the opening keynote was given by Angela Sasse.
She suggested that "Security measures that waste users' time" should
be one of the OWASP Top Ten because they undermine security. Should we
have a test description for this based on Angela's presentation?

Thanks Colin, 
? Great work! 
Regarding testing for "security measure that waste users' time", I'm not sure we can definitively or quantitatively test for security usability. But Angela's point is valid for usability and user acceptance testing. Do you have some thoughts of how we could achieve this? A test for dancing pigs test case? ;)

You are probably right - the dancing pigs test case might be difficult to
define adequately.  Maybe add to the the 2015 edition?

We probably don't have to test for usabilit y, particularly given?functional testers have that ground covered. B ut we could put a few notes against the relevant controls, like CAPTCHA, prompting the security tester to evaluate whether the control is necessary or usable.

Message-ID: <CAKD3bBRPH2hBPbA4ccex2e8mb97ND8-u092GyxJhJ0rmLKnnjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

I've recently changed my job and now I'm more involved in web application
security testing. As a personal task I want read the whole owasp testing
guide 4.

I've see that the version 4 is a working in progress.

Are there some way I can contribute in the 'owasp testing guide 4'  in the
meantime I'm reading it ? In alternative are there some stuff I can do to
contribute ?

As all I've not a lot of free time but with an 'best effort approach' I
want try to contribute with some small steps.

Also, Is there an official IRC channel to keep in touch with the community
?
I'm from Italy and afaik the local chapter is not so active.

thank you.

R.

We use this mailing list as official channel for the communications.

Please take a look at the archive:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/

3) Italian contributions:

The Italian Chapter is contributing to the OWASP Testing Guide project
with the following guys from many times:Claudio Merloni, Alberto
Revelli, Luca Carettoni, Paolo Perego, Luca Carettoni, Antonio Parata,
Giorgio Fedon, Stefano Di Paola, Mauro Bregolin, Carlo Pelliccioni,
Gianrico Ingrosso, Davide Danelon and me.
