&gt;<i> HI guys,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve now bench tested the Pen Test draft checklist three times in my 
</I>&gt;<i> work (we do a lot of short pen tests &#8230; 3-5 days). I&#8217;ve got a few notes 
</I>&gt;<i> for your consideration for the final.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The work flow chart needs a little more regarding infrastructure 
</I>&gt;<i> information gathering. I know it is an application level document, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it is useful to either detail a reference to a good network pentest 
</I>&gt;<i> guide, or provide a little guidance on using certain tools and 
</I>&gt;<i> techniques to gather adequate information about the environment that 
</I>&gt;<i> the application runs atop. I always like to have a good map of where 
</I>&gt;<i> my victims lay, so I try firewalk and hping and ftp bounce attacks if 
</I>&gt;<i> I can to detail the behind the firewall view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, in 1999, I pen tested a finance reporting app, which I 
</I>&gt;<i> initially broke into by using broadcast ping sweep to find the app 
</I>&gt;<i> servers, followed by using a sniffer to get some usernames and 
</I>&gt;<i> passwords. Once I had a working credential, not only did the app lift 
</I>&gt;<i> its skirts and expose last week&#8217;s dirty laundry, it was eye opening 
</I>&gt;<i> how much more fun you could have with a little credentialed access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back to the checklist&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I spent a little too much time on the authentication area&#8217;s 
</I>&gt;<i> parameter manipulation the first time I used it, as I mistook this 
</I>&gt;<i> task as an invitation to perform as much parameter manipulation as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. I tend to find it is easier to spider the entire app as I 
</I>&gt;<i> know it, and then have a go at parameter manipulation first, and then 
</I>&gt;<i> play with session handling and authentication once I have some decent 
</I>&gt;<i> bookmarked URLs to muck around with. I also tend to re-spider when I 
</I>&gt;<i> know there&#8217;s Javascript HREFs coming into play, as pretty much every 
</I>&gt;<i> single spider program out there can&#8217;t work out JS popups and so on. 
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m thinking that it may make more sense to detail a few attack trees 
</I>&gt;<i> and then provide the checklist in this order, walking the attack tree 
</I>&gt;<i> in a logical order which builds atop previous work. Starting with 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication in this instance may make sense, but we may also wish 
</I>&gt;<i> to wait for the data validation / parameter manipulation section 
</I>&gt;<i> before attacking the authentication and session management parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The checklist misses default accounts. These are rich sources of fun 
</I>&gt;<i> and profit, especially for well-known applications and LDAP based 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication schemes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also like to have a go at using common paths&#8230; like /admin/, /images/ 
</I>&gt;<i> and /backup/ just to see if there&#8217;s anything there. This is not 
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned as far as I can tell, but it&#8217;s a good one to try if you 
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t know much about the application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, configuration is not mentioned nearly enough*. Everyone knows 
</I>&gt;<i> (well, actually, they don&#8217;t) that you should check for snoop.jsp / 
</I>&gt;<i> (various)Spy.jsp and so on in J2EE environments to find out what is 
</I>&gt;<i> chewing juice and to occasionally enumerate loaded modules. Each 
</I>&gt;<i> language and many authoring solutions tend to stick to a few well worn 
</I>&gt;<i> patterns. The pentest document should note this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Andrew

</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * In the last review using this checklist, I couldn&#8217;t initially break 
</I>&gt;<i> into the application because the authentication page was nice and 
</I>&gt;<i> robust&#8230; Shame about the operating system not being patched and the web 
</I>&gt;<i> application server being misconfigured.
</I>&gt;<i>
