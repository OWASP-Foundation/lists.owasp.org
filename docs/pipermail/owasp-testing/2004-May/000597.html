Harinath,

Page 17 - I used yellow and forgot to say, &quot;Include reference&quot;.  I want all
the books and anything referencable to end up with ALA citations at the
back, and the yellow is a way for me to remember to come back and fill that
in, so that citations within the text will end up like &quot;... Boris Belzier in
his book Software Testing Techniques [BELZIER01], a knowledgeable ...&quot; 

Page 22. Most test plans (when they exist) I see are drawn from business,
technical and user requirements and are typically just Excel spreadsheets.
Sometimes they are just e-mails of things that went wrong with the last
build. Rarely do they have even minor sanity / desk-checking / assertion /
boundary checks or security tests included. In this instance, I agree that
it is a huge area to cover, and maybe it might be better to point people who
are interested in writing comprehensive and useful test plans to a
reference. Which would you suggest?

Thanks,
Andrew

Andrew,

Here are couple of question from my side with respect to your comments. 

1. On Page No 17, you highlighted the first line of &quot;What is Inspection?&quot;
section. There is no comment for that. Why did you comment it? 

2. On Page No 22, regarding the Test Plan, do you want me to elaborate the
structure of test plan. This would unnecessarily increase the content of the
document and might deviate from the core of the doc. What do you say? If you
want, I can give more details on the same.

Do clarify and I shall update the document immediately.

Hari
