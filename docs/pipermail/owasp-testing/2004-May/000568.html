Subject: Draft 0.5

 

Hi there,

 

I've &quot;finished&quot; several passes of editing 0.44. There are significant
changes to some text, little in other places.

 

The minor changes are:

 

*	spelling mistakes should very nearly be gone
*	grammar is fixed in most areas
*	Fixed up template hell. There's one template hell left (you'll spot
it). 
*	verbal dribble has been minimized, sometimes ruthlessly. Please
don't take it personally. There's more to come, particularly towards the end
of the document

 

There are some minor quibbles with the written English remaining in the
draft. 

 

Tense: are we going non-passive? I hope so. If so, we need to eliminate past
tense and passive voice unless we really are talking about something that
happened in the past. 

 

Sexist language. There is no excuse for using &quot;he&quot; and other masculine
pronouns in this day and age. We'll be caned for it. Can I respectfully ask
the author(s) of the section who used &quot;he&quot; throughout their section to have
a shot at re-wording every paragraph without it? Use &quot;the attacker&quot; or
similar instead.

 

Pronouns, &quot;us&quot; &quot;we&quot;, &quot;you&quot; &quot;your&quot;, etc. This is either a formal document, in
which case pronoun usage is eliminated, or this is a chatty document, in
which case, we ensure all the text is like that. Can I have some feeling
about which way to go?

 

There are major structural changes I think need to be undertaken, but I want
to consult here prior to making them. Nearly every chapter wants to define
how to do their little part, and there's a lot of overlap between the
chapters and material which is covered (in some cases much better) elsewhere
in the OWASP universe. I think this document should be hard core about how
to define and benchmark a testing framework, not detail the Penetration Test
Checklist or repeat sections better handled by the Guide. There's obviously
been a great deal of work here, and I don't want to see it lost, but it
would help the readability and focus immeasurably if a lot of the repetitive
content is amalgamated and each section closely follow the scope set out in
the first chapter. 

 

</PRE>
