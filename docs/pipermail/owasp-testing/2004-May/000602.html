<PRE>HI guys,

 

I've now bench tested the Pen Test draft checklist three times in my work
(we do a lot of short pen tests . 3-5 days). I've got a few notes for your
consideration for the final.

 

The work flow chart needs a little more regarding infrastructure information
gathering. I know it is an application level document, but it is useful to
either detail a reference to a good network pentest guide, or provide a
little guidance on using certain tools and techniques to gather adequate
information about the environment that the application runs atop. I always
like to have a good map of where my victims lay, so I try firewalk and hping
and ftp bounce attacks if I can to detail the behind the firewall view.

 

For example, in 1999, I pen tested a finance reporting app, which I
initially broke into by using broadcast ping sweep to find the app servers,
followed by using a sniffer to get some usernames and passwords. Once I had
a working credential, not only did the app lift its skirts and expose last
week's dirty laundry, it was eye opening how much more fun you could have
with a little credentialed access. 

 

Back to the checklist.

 

I think I spent a little too much time on the authentication area's
parameter manipulation the first time I used it, as I mistook this task as
an invitation to perform as much parameter manipulation as possible. I tend
to find it is easier to spider the entire app as I know it, and then have a
go at parameter manipulation first, and then play with session handling and
authentication once I have some decent bookmarked URLs to muck around with.
I also tend to re-spider when I know there's Javascript HREFs coming into
play, as pretty much every single spider program out there can't work out JS
popups and so on. I'm thinking that it may make more sense to detail a few
attack trees and then provide the checklist in this order, walking the
attack tree in a logical order which builds atop previous work. Starting
with authentication in this instance may make sense, but we may also wish to
wait for the data validation / parameter manipulation section before
attacking the authentication and session management parameters. 

 

The checklist misses default accounts. These are rich sources of fun and
profit, especially for well-known applications and LDAP based authentication
schemes.

 

I also like to have a go at using common paths. like /admin/, /images/ and
/backup/ just to see if there's anything there. This is not mentioned as far
as I can tell, but it's a good one to try if you don't know much about the
application.

 

Also, configuration is not mentioned nearly enough*. Everyone knows (well,
actually, they don't) that you should check for snoop.jsp / (various)Spy.jsp
and so on in J2EE environments to find out what is chewing juice and to
occasionally enumerate loaded modules. Each language and many authoring
solutions tend to stick to a few well worn patterns. The pentest document
should note this. 

 

Thanks,

Andrew

 

* In the last review using this checklist, I couldn't initially break into
the application because the authentication page was nice and robust. Shame
about the operating system not being patched and the web application server
being misconfigured.
