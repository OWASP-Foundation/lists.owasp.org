<PRE>Great idea, though i'd like us to not use the dummy connotation :0)

The biggest issue i've seen recently is the lack of testing  
experience with todays batch of pentesters. Maybe it's me being a old  
fart, but i feel todays testers dont have the background knowledge  
and act using the HackingExposed (tm) methodology.

Matteo, your idea is brilliant and one that needs to be included

</I>&gt;<i> What we can do is to add a &quot;summary&quot; or &quot;abstract&quot; to the beginning of

</I>&gt;<i> The summary must not be longer than 50/60 words, and must clearly

</I>&gt;<i> the following two questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What kind of vulnerability are we testing ?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What are the risks posed by such a vulnerability ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second point is very important, as it would provide a non- 
</I>&gt;<i> technical
</I>&gt;<i> reader (read: a suit) a quick understanding of the danger, and it  
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> make the guide a good reference point also from a risk assessment
</I>&gt;<i> perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a further example, here's how I'd write a summary for &quot;googling&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ==SUMMARY==
</I>&gt;<i> This test checks whether queries to search engines can provide
</I>&gt;<i> information that is not supposed to be public.
</I>&gt;<i> The impact of the vulnerability is the disclosure of
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary/confidential information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alberto
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;PROPOSAL&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I propose to prepend EACH technique (all the 4.x.x paragraph) with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;for dummies&quot; paragraph meant to be read by people that don't know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the problem and giving a little insight on the subject from a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NON TECH view. LANGUAGE will be different, avoiding techie slang and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FORM would be different, outlining concepts instead of points....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I DO NOT suggest a &quot;for dummy&quot; title, but something like &quot;Overview&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and &quot;Technology&quot; division....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let's take a look to an example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> e.g. &quot;Being able to tamper with cookies may result in hijacking the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sessions of legitimate users&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Will become:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Manipulating the cookie content may result, and often results, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changing the environment and may lead to simulate another user or to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gain unauthorized privileges or access&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The aim is to let a TOTAL IDIOT (like me =]) understand what we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talking about without falling into technical speech too much and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without letting the subject to frighten a reader.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In addition to this not anyone is prepared to cope with every subject
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and more often than not I'm sure that people will thank us for that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and our introduction will explain them what to read and how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document on a peculiar subject...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll be able (as an ignorant) to take a look at most of the subjects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and to write briefings but what I'd really like is to know what do  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all think about this approach...
