<PRE>I don't want to prolong this anymore, but I'd recommend that we enforce that
it be a very brief description (I'd say a bullet item - powerpoint stuff).
You'll lose the reader if he/she's an idiot anyway ;)

 

Regards,

 

Mark

HI Matteo,

If the majority of the team wish to add the &quot;idiots guide&quot; (this makes me
smile), then so be it, cool.

 

I think we should be carefull that we dont reinvent  the wheel or repeat
definitions that we already have on the site. We can simply add a URL to a
section on the OWASP site to the same information.?

 

Matteo (Meucci), as technical AoC lead, its your call, if thats  ok with
everyone?

 

Eoin

Hi Eoin and thanx for the answer,

sorry for being blunt, but I humbly think this way you'll just loose
80% of the audience. 
The world isnt' made by pentest-geniouses and while I don't suggest to
explain &quot;what a cookie is&quot; I strongly suggest to give the idiots a
chance...

&quot;That's, of course, just my 2eurocents, but you can't suppose everyone 
will know everything and all the document risks to be setted in a
corner for reference only by managers. And this means it will be
setted in a corner by decision makers. And this means less and less
adoption... 

That's, of course, just my opinion having to handle to tenths of
organizations that choose ISO27001 over OSSTTMM for VA only because
thay understand the former and not the latter...

This said it's not a religious belief on my side and I may be (and 
probabily am) wrong...

Think about how many people know laws... And what's the problem of laws?

&quot;The former article XXX of YYY is changed according to YYY and XXX
while articole WWW will modify TTT to be real at EEE on ZZZ.&quot; 



My 2eurocents as always and I'll not pursue this more.

MgpF
