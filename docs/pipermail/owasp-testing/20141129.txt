Subject: [Owasp-testing] OTG-AUTHZ-001 repeated
Message-ID: <CAK8whjYFevd3MV11B5roeefLUzcpQvhVbTOAaaXpV7NGDx4_4A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi web-geeks,
 I was reviewing the PDF release (v4) version of the OTG and found that
OTG-AUTHZ-001 is repeated.
Looks like one is an older version that was not removed.
Sorry but I didn't review all the history of this list to see if you
already know about this, and apologize if it is was detected already.

regards
