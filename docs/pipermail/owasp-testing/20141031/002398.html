<PRE>Hi all

New to list so apologies if there is an errata section I should have checked.

Firstly I really like the guide. I am co-lead on Security Testing Strategy in SAP and we will certainly be using this info to educate our development teams.
I am also liking the ASVS too.

On PDF page 11/224 of OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4.pdf, top right 2nd column:

For example, in June 2002, the US National Institute of Standards
(NIST) published a survey on the cost of insecure software to the US
economy due to inadequate software testing [3]. Interestingly, they
estimate that a better testing infrastructure would save more than a
third of these costs, or about $22 billion a year. More recently, the links
between economics and security have been studied by academic researchers.
See [4] for more information about some of these efforts.

While estimating the cost of insecure software may appear a daunting
task, there has been a significant amount of work in this direction.

I know one has to repeat to make a point, but seems to me there is some duplication here?
