<PRE>Hi Andrew,
Congrats is in order btw.
I believe Hannaford were PCI compliant according the information at hand.
Which highlights the meaning of compliance as opposed to secure. Compliance
is simply a business enabler to show &quot;we are making an effort&quot; as opposed to
the esoteric &quot;we are secure&quot; statement IMO.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really doubt that Hannaford was PCI DSS compliant:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Requirement 3 - Protect Card Holder Data. Losing 4.2 million records
</I>&gt;<i> requires failing Section 3.1 &quot;Keep cardholder data to a
</I>&gt;<i> minimum&quot; (basically ditch the PAN and expiry as soon as you're done
</I>&gt;<i> with them), and Section 3.4 &quot;Render PAN, unreadable anywhere where it
</I>&gt;<i> is stored&quot;. FAIL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Requirement 6 - Section 6.1, keeping up with patches. I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> of any site that meets PCI's 1 month deadline to install new patches
</I>&gt;<i> for critical components. It would be surprising to me if Hannaford did
</I>&gt;<i> this. Possible fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Section 6.5 - do a Top 10 review. This is the old Top 10 2004. 6.5.8
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;Insecure storage&quot; - enough said! FAIL
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Requirement 10 - Monitor and Test Networks and Requirement 11
</I>&gt;<i> Regularly Test security systems and processes. In particular section
</I>&gt;<i> 10.6:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Review logs for all system components at least daily. Log reviews
</I>&gt;<i> must include those servers that perform security functions like
</I>&gt;<i> intrusion detection system (IDS) and authentication, authorization,
</I>&gt;<i> and accounting protocol (AAA) servers (for example, RADIUS).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and 11.3.2 - conduct annual application layer pen tests
</I>&gt;<i> and 11.4 and 11.5 which says to install network and host IDS and
</I>&gt;<i> network IPS and file integrity monitoring software. These should have
</I>&gt;<i> immediately notified admin staff of changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hannaford didn't detect the breach for nearly three months. That
</I>&gt;<i> implies a lack of effective intrusion detection and monitoring EVEN if
</I>&gt;<i> they had the above items in place, operational, and logging
</I>&gt;<i> successfully, and someone is monitoring them. Which I highly doubt.
</I>&gt;<i> FAIL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Arguable:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Section 6.6 - mandates a code review or a web application firewall,
</I>&gt;<i> but only AFTER JUNE 30. They can be compliant up to now with neither
</I>&gt;<i> of these in place. We know that WAFs today are simply not enough to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent attacks from a motivated, skilled attacker. They are great
</I>&gt;<i> defense in depth and they do knock out script kiddie attacks. If
</I>&gt;<i> Hannaford obtained a code review, then the assessor wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> particularly good, or the firm refused to fix known issues, or both. I
</I>&gt;<i> think this is the area we will see the lawyers involved with if it can
</I>&gt;<i> be argued that 6.6 is REQUIRED to be complied with today. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> believe so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my personal opinion, even given the limited information that is
</I>&gt;<i> public, from the first two issues above alone, we can assume Hannaford
</I>&gt;<i> were/are non-compliant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PCI DSS makes it abundantly clear what folks must do to be safer:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 1.  Don't store CC numbers. Really, really, really don't store
</I>&gt;<i> them. You don't need them.
</I>&gt;<i> Steps 2..153 However, if you want to damage your business reputation,
</I>&gt;<i> destroy customer confidence, lose shareholder value, set a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> money on fire by protecting information you don't need (and shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> want), then here goes... do this wishy-washy list of items. But do it
</I>&gt;<i> properly, or you'll get pwned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hannaford ignored #1 and got pwned even though they did *some* of the
</I>&gt;<i> next 153 steps required for PCI DSS. In PCI DSS 1.2, they really
</I>&gt;<i> should make it real short and sweet:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are no valid business reasons for storing CC's. If you do, you
</I>&gt;<i> fail PCI DSS compliance. This is how you use authorization numbers for
</I>&gt;<i> these common business cases:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a one pager in my view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks,
