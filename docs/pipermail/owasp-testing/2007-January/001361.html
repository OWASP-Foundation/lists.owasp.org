<PRE>Hang on one moment on the group hug there busta!!

The latest version is OSSTMM.3.0 (which is in RC mode). Now to access  
this you need to be a GOLD, or Silver, member and Gold costs $259 and  
Silver $49
If you want the free version, well thats stuck at ver 2.0 and has  
been for years now.

If you are saying we collaborate, and i have no issue with this, then  
something needs to be done.

It might say open source on the tin, but from where im sitting it  
looks like a pay as you go open source and im sorry, none of the  
content i have written will ever be charged for and this is one of  
the sole reasons i joined with Mark and Jeff when OWASP was started  
back in the day.

&gt;<i> Matteo, thank you very much for such elequent argument on the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I proposed that we include a section (couple pages) in the OWASP
