Daniel, I really don't understand your rage, but I'll try (again) to  
cope with anger. Anger has always been the worst of the counselors.

&gt;<i> The latest version is OSSTMM.3.0 (which is in RC mode). Now to

</I>&gt;<i> $259 and Silver $49

</I>&gt;<i> been for years now.
</I>
OSSTMM is in RC and will see the light in just a few time.
You can rest assured of this since I've talked with Pete about that a  
lot of times. (And is someone care I perfectly agree on &quot;2.0 sucks&quot;,  
while 3.0 is another thing at all...).

&gt;<i> If you are saying we collaborate, and i have no issue with this,  
</I>&gt;<i> then something needs to be done.
</I>
I'm sure we can find an accommodation and I'm sure I'll be able to  
provide the 3.0 for review to a panel of OWASP... Or so I think... I  
may have to press Pete a little, but I'm sure that's feasible.
And I don't really believe in &quot;insurmountable&quot; tasks.

&gt;<i> It might say open source on the tin, but from where im sitting it  
</I>&gt;<i> looks like a pay as you go open source and im sorry, none of the  
</I>&gt;<i> content i have written will ever be charged for and this is one of  
</I>&gt;<i> the sole reasons i joined with Mark and Jeff when OWASP was started  
</I>&gt;<i> back in the day.
</I>
No one told you to give content to OSSTMM.
We were discussing in &quot;taking&quot; content from OSSTMM acknowledging the  
source and have OSSTMM &quot;refer&quot; to code within OWASP.
Sorry if my bad english went in the way and you were lead to think  
I'd give your work for a paid submission.. That wasn't my idea.

Hope this explain it all... And sorry again for my &quot;spaghetti  
english&quot; ;)
