Hi all,

sorry for the long message, but as I told you all I was asking Pete  
to respond to the questions that were on the list...

Here there is.
Please, take in account that there are PETE ideas ;)

Hope this help a bit and have a good week!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanx!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for sharing this and giving me a chance to respond.  I'll do

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This mail might sound harsh, but I just want to get the facts

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be better off collaborating with Information Systems  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) than with ISECOM's OSSTM.  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But, then again, it's not my call.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will not try to sell you on an ISECOM collaboration.  I just want

</I>&gt;<i> a lot to say here and I never really talked about all of it in one  
</I>&gt;<i> place before.  I mean, there's no forum or support group I found  
</I>&gt;<i> that really understands me ;)  But sure, all of the stuff I write  
</I>&gt;<i> here has been said by me before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Does OSSTM really use an OSS license? I'm sorry I'm going to be  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the one that dissapoints you, but the answer is a very big NO.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here are the facts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I will be responding on these comments, I am not discounting  
</I>&gt;<i> their perception, views, or opinion.  I am only sharing my version  
</I>&gt;<i> of what and why we are doing what we do.  You may disagree with me  
</I>&gt;<i> but do understand this is only my viewpoint. And I am always  
</I>&gt;<i> interested to see other viewpoints of what we do here at ISECOM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Version 2.0 (released february 2003) refered to the GPL but had  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this statement in the front page of the document: &quot;Any  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> information contained within this document may not be modified or  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sold without the express consent of the author.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We were informed early on in 2002 that the GPL does not handle  
</I>&gt;<i> copyright of documents.  So we added the copyright to allow that  
</I>&gt;<i> nobody would exploit us by copying and selling the OSSTMM as a  
</I>&gt;<i> book.  Remember even in 2003, the concept was all very new and we  
</I>&gt;<i> were forging the way for ourselves.  I still hear stories from  
</I>&gt;<i> people who first got involved with ISECOM through the OSSTMM where  
</I>&gt;<i> they copy/pasted much of some sections and re-sold it to clients as  
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.  Maybe you know others who did as well?  But I knew  
</I>&gt;<i> that would happen and just I needed to prevent it from happening on  
</I>&gt;<i> a huge scale.  At the time, it was the only way we could conduct  
</I>&gt;<i> the growth of the OSSTMM and try for longevity.  It's also a  
</I>&gt;<i> strategy we changed in 2006.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Version 2.2 (released november 2006) [1] (c)footer states &quot;Any  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> information contained within this document may not be modified or  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sold without the express consent of ISECOM. OSSTMM for free  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dissemination under the Open Methodology License (OML) and CC  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Creative Commons 2.5 Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the update, we chose to go with the CC copyleft because now, as  
</I>&gt;<i> a standard, we had to make sure the document didn't fork.  We had  
</I>&gt;<i> to prevent more than 1 standard of the same methodology out there  
</I>&gt;<i> and we had to assure that any forking which occurred, would be  
</I>&gt;<i> shared back with us so we could provide them publicly.  This has  
</I>&gt;<i> happened already and because of our requirements, the projects did  
</I>&gt;<i> come back for us to host.  Most all of them are available in our  
</I>&gt;<i> project collaboration site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * The &quot;Open Methodology License&quot; is *not* an open source license  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (or an open document license for that matter), please read http:// 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> www.isecom.org/oml.shtml
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Open Source in the document title was never meant to reflect  
</I>&gt;<i> the document.  It was meant to address this &quot;secret&quot; methodology so  
</I>&gt;<i> many security companies proclaimed in the early part of this  
</I>&gt;<i> decade.  We wanted a methodology that was free and freely available  
</I>&gt;<i> for use by anyone. However a collaborating lawyer volunteered a  
</I>&gt;<i> little piece of info early on: a methodology is considered a Trade  
</I>&gt;<i> Secret and NOT protected by the GPL. So I did the best I could to  
</I>&gt;<i> outline what we really meant.  That became the OML.  It's an Open  
</I>&gt;<i> Trade Secret.  We did this to prevent others from classifying it  
</I>&gt;<i> and legally defending it as THEIR trade secret.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * The CC Creative Commons 2.5 with NoDerivs and NonCommercial  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attached to it is *not* an open source license
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, but we did have a valid reason for this as I explained  
</I>&gt;<i> above.  While we want the method to be open and free, we don't want  
</I>&gt;<i> some middleman putting the OSSTMM DOCUMENT somewhere for commercial  
</I>&gt;<i> distribution without our permission.  You'll see that we never stop  
</I>&gt;<i> non-commercial distribution such as on Live Linux CDs like Local  
</I>&gt;<i> Are Security (LAS) and others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So yes, the methodology is freely distributable even by commercial  
</I>&gt;<i> organizations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> They are not open source because nobody (besides ISECOM) can:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - make new versions of the OSSTMM
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes they can but then only if it comes back to us to share out  
</I>&gt;<i> freely again.  I would LOVE it if somebody else sat down and  
</I>&gt;<i> hammered out a brand new OSSTMM that improves everything!!  It  
</I>&gt;<i> would go immediately to public download for peer review!  I know  
</I>&gt;<i> that won't happen but we did have 1 guy who made a policy  
</I>&gt;<i> management handbook out of the OSSTMM for his company which was  
</I>&gt;<i> really a new version of the OSSTMM but with identical look, feel,  
</I>&gt;<i> and methodology.  I still have it but we didn't post it publicly as  
</I>&gt;<i> a project because it actually wasn't very good.  So we folded it  
</I>&gt;<i> into the BIT project where that guy is a collaborator now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - use OSSTMM for commercial purposes (including packaging it and  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> selling it in a book)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not true.  It can be used for ALL commercial purposes except to  
</I>&gt;<i> sell or distribute the document commercially for profit and  
</I>&gt;<i> personal gain.  That is something that I think is unfair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - nobody can make commercial software based on the OSSTM (without  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> violating the OML)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course they can make software based on the OSSTMM.  We just want  
</I>&gt;<i> to be in the loop on it.  There's some commercial, OSSTMM-focused  
</I>&gt;<i> software out there and more coming all the time.  Not all of it I  
</I>&gt;<i> think is okay but none of it we profit from right now.  But we can  
</I>&gt;<i> at least be in the development and QC process to make sure they  
</I>&gt;<i> don't take short-cuts and put our logo on garbage just for sales  
</I>&gt;<i> and marketing purposes.  It's no secret that the OSSTMM has become  
</I>&gt;<i> a brand therefore we need to assure quality.  It's also no secret  
</I>&gt;<i> that there's a lot of people who try to use our brand for their  
</I>&gt;<i> sales but have nothing to do with us or the OSSTMM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OSS licenses (See www.opensource.org) do allow commercial use of  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the work and, indeed, is one of the pillars of open source. See  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the Open Source Definition (<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/docs/">http://www.opensource.org/docs/</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> definition.php) specifically:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - &quot;1. Free Redistribution&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - &quot;3. Derived Works&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with those things, especially for software.  Again, a  
</I>&gt;<i> methodology isn't software and special measures need to be made to  
</I>&gt;<i> open it and guarantee it remains open.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I repeat: something that does not allow for somebody else to  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> profit from it (yes, even if he did not contribute) is *not* open  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> source. It is &quot;gratis&quot; source (i.e. it's &quot;free&quot; beer but not  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;free&quot; speech).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what do you call a methodology that does let others profit from  
</I>&gt;<i> it commercially even if the paper it's wrapped in is not?  So if I  
</I>&gt;<i> give away the methodology for a thorough security test so anyone  
</I>&gt;<i> can use it and make it and sell it to others who can't do it  
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, what do you call that?  I think it's pretty open and  
</I>&gt;<i> free.  You keep focusing on the document and not the methodology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Further proof of ISECOM no longer providing an OSS product is the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fact that its community has really faded away. The activity on  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the public mailing lists has been fading since the license change  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and is now esentially cero.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, our community has moved mostly to the collaboration web  
</I>&gt;<i> site for discussion.  We have 146 active participants as of right  
</I>&gt;<i> now not counting partners, grad students, trainers, subscribers, EU  
</I>&gt;<i> consortium members, and email-based contributors.  Our news lists  
</I>&gt;<i> reach over 30,000 people at the moment.  We keep all this together  
</I>&gt;<i> with myself, 1 other full-time worker and 2 part-time workers we  
</I>&gt;<i> hired in the middle of 2006.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will agree with you that keeping volunteers motivated and helpful  
</I>&gt;<i> is getting harder but I hear that it's like that all over-- new  
</I>&gt;<i> generation maybe?  We are trying to address this through using a  
</I>&gt;<i> project collaboration site and now through a website redesign that  
</I>&gt;<i> makes better use of web technology so we can have multiple editors  
</I>&gt;<i> for maintaining project updates, translations, and news pages.  But  
</I>&gt;<i> as some of you know, it's the infrastructure that gets the least  
</I>&gt;<i> attention when you're busy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully we will have this addressed early this year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ISECOM certainly does not follow the &quot;release early, release  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> often&quot; model, and has a tight control of version distributions.   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The current OSSTMM (2.2) has more or less the same contents as  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the one released three years back (2.0).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ouch!  Well, I only have myself to blame.  What you don't see is  
</I>&gt;<i> that the updates in 2.2 reflect 3 years of security metrics  
</I>&gt;<i> research.  So you download it and read it and think, eh, so what?   
</I>&gt;<i> But in reality, there were hundreds of revisions to those metrics  
</I>&gt;<i> and to all the terminology and supporting documentation that went  
</I>&gt;<i> into it.  There's also hundreds of pages of supporting material  
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't fit because it either doesn't work or because it's too  
</I>&gt;<i> early to introduce such concepts into the marketplace. For example,  
</I>&gt;<i> to get to the RAV metrics, we also devised Trust metrics.  We have  
</I>&gt;<i> a means and an algorithm to compute Trust without human input.  So  
</I>&gt;<i> ebay does not need to let buyers and sellers judge each other  
</I>&gt;<i> alone, it can also compute Trust values on each member based on the  
</I>&gt;<i> facts it has.  But this will not be introduced into the OSSTMM even  
</I>&gt;<i> though the research came from it.  It will go into AVIT however,  
</I>&gt;<i> which is the methodology for Trusted Computing as a means for the  
</I>&gt;<i> user to have the computer self-calculate current trustworthiness in  
</I>&gt;<i> the OpenTC project (opentc.net).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other problem with releasing the OSSTMM early is that as a  
</I>&gt;<i> standard it is criticized if it is incomplete.  If it is incomplete  
</I>&gt;<i> it cannot be used by the government agencies or many of the larger  
</I>&gt;<i> commercial entities who need to rely on something solid for their  
</I>&gt;<i> boards. If it's incomplete, smaller companies have trouble  
</I>&gt;<i> defending it to the other companies they sell tests to based on  
</I>&gt;<i> that methodology.  Some countries depend on it as a standard for  
</I>&gt;<i> all government work.   So we need to make sure it's solid. With 3  
</I>&gt;<i> being a completely new methodology backed by all new research it  
</I>&gt;<i> was clear it would take time and money to develop. See, it's  
</I>&gt;<i> different from 1.0 when we just correlated good ideas about testing  
</I>&gt;<i> or 2.0 when we added detail to 1.0.  In 3 we researched everything  
</I>&gt;<i> from the ground up and found better ways to classify vulnerability  
</I>&gt;<i> types, defined controls, analyzed possible error types, and  
</I>&gt;<i> everything else where we really gave the security auditor a book of  
</I>&gt;<i> facts to launch operational security audits from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we have subscribers who have access to the OSSTMM alphas and  
</I>&gt;<i> betas. But so do all the collaborators.  I thought it wasn't fair  
</I>&gt;<i> that those who actively worked had the same access to the project  
</I>&gt;<i> as those who didn't help at all.  So we found subscriptions to be a  
</I>&gt;<i> good way to maintain the project while maintaining fair balance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Believe me, I am NOT delaying the release of the OSSTMM.  It truly  
</I>&gt;<i> isn't done and I am extremely embarrassed about it.  It is a very  
</I>&gt;<i> sore point for me because I am exhausted with it.  Every time I  
</I>&gt;<i> thought it would be ready for release, another improvement was  
</I>&gt;<i> identified to be written into it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> esn't it sound strange to you that 3.0 is not yet in a  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;releasable&quot; state and, at the same time, ISECOM has been (since  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2004) providing &quot;OSSTMM 3.0 Certification classes&quot;? (for OPST and  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OPSA)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds strange when you don't know what you learn in those  
</I>&gt;<i> classes but both are certifications to prove skills required by the  
</I>&gt;<i> OSSTMM networking section.  For OSSTMM 3.0, we already knew what  
</I>&gt;<i> those skills would have to be.  Of course writing all the  
</I>&gt;<i> background on those skills as well as having the correct  
</I>&gt;<i> terminology is much more work.  So yes, we knew since 2004 what  
</I>&gt;<i> skills we would to be sure all testers and analysts would need to  
</I>&gt;<i> have to do their jobs correctly and apply the OSSTMM.  Skills you  
</I>&gt;<i> can mirror before you can describe them.  It's like the difference  
</I>&gt;<i> between knowing what kind of tropical-diseases doctor you want to  
</I>&gt;<i> go to and actually writing his tropical-disease treatment text  
</I>&gt;<i> book.  You can say, he should know how to take a blood sample  
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently without contaminating it so you be sure to teach him to  
</I>&gt;<i> take a blood sample.  You say what he needs to look for in that  
</I>&gt;<i> blood sample so you teach him that.  And you adjust with the times  
</I>&gt;<i> and the tools.  If there are better, safer, faster, cleaner ways to  
</I>&gt;<i> take blood, you adjust and show them.  But none of that will change  
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that the book you write on it will require him to take a  
</I>&gt;<i> blood sample in most circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So no, I don't think it's strange and neither do most of our  
</I>&gt;<i> students.  I know because I do get reports of all feedback comments  
</I>&gt;<i> from all courses world wide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Other projects which have turned &quot;commercial&quot; (which is not a bad  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thing in and of itself) have done it wrong and have taken similar  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> steps to try to close access to contents they produce and control  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the commercialisation (sp?) of their work. Eventually, all of  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them have turned into non-open-source projects and the community  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that started helping them out eventually left for greener pastures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ISECOM is not commercial and we are not doing any controlling for  
</I>&gt;<i> commercial reasons.  Our reasons are quality and standardization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've made my share of contributions to the OSSTMM, reviewing,  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> providing content and translations (for the website and the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> texts). I even contributed a full &quot;XML security module&quot; (for SOAP  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> testing) back in 2002 which has yet to be made public and I'm  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pretty sure it's part of the contents of 3.0 (promised to be  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> released in 2004). I finally
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes you did help and I still have that.  It didn't make it into 3.0  
</I>&gt;<i> because it didn't fit.  It does fit into 2.0 but when we decided to  
</I>&gt;<i> scrap that method for many many reasons, we didn't have a place for  
</I>&gt;<i> it.  I have many modules and parts like this, especially for  
</I>&gt;<i> specific app tests, that we are now working to integrate into  
</I>&gt;<i> specialty versions of the OSSTMM where we re-write them into the  
</I>&gt;<i> new methodology with new modules.  But that hasn't happened yet.   
</I>&gt;<i> But you will get attribution for the work you did. We've never  
</I>&gt;<i> stolen work from anyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> left the project when it started taking a route I did not like  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (and I'm not alone in this decission). Neither me nor many other  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> previous contributors are credited any longer in recent versions  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the manuals even if the text we contributed is still  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (verbatim) there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is news to me.  The 3 draft has no contributors listed because  
</I>&gt;<i> we do that at the end just before the release.  If you are  
</I>&gt;<i> referring 2.2 then I need to investigate this.  It was clearly an  
</I>&gt;<i> oversight and the right thing for you to do would have been to  
</I>&gt;<i> address it to me with the part in there you wrote and was not  
</I>&gt;<i> attributed.  It certainly was not malicious.  Same goes for all  
</I>&gt;<i> those other contributors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We got thousands of submissions and they come and go through peer  
</I>&gt;<i> review. Sometimes, we make mistakes and leave in someone whose work  
</I>&gt;<i> was removed and remove someone whose work got marked to be deleted  
</I>&gt;<i> but then stayed in.  I'm truly and sincerely sorry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the truth is Javier that I remembered you as a  
</I>&gt;<i> contributor and if you would have asked me for the latest version  
</I>&gt;<i> of the OSSTMM for review, I would have sent it to you in confidence  
</I>&gt;<i> to not redistribute until it was complete.  I guess now it might  
</I>&gt;<i> have been stupid seeing how you seem to really think about us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> PS: Feel free to show me wrong in any of the above statements.  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe the project has taken a different route differently and  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've missed it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do hope you understand now how we did keep the methodologies open  
</I>&gt;<i> and free and why it is the way it is at ISECOM.  Remember, on top  
</I>&gt;<i> of all this, I have a family and a life where my daughter thought  
</I>&gt;<i> my full name was &quot;Pete from ISECOM&quot; when she turned 2 because  
</I>&gt;<i> that's what she heard me say on the phone meetings all the time.
