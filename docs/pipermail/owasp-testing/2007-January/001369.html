<PRE>rage? me? pfft you haven't met me yet, i rarely get angry.

All i was saying was that OWASP and the OSSTM have different  
ideologies. As it was just pointed out, they use the term open source  
very very very loosely.
If it was open source, why can i not get hold of a copy of the RC  
beta for version 3 right now and look at it?

Sorry if you thought i was angry, it was totally the opposite and  
called sarcasm :0)

Personally i want to stay FAR away from OSSTM and since 2001, we have  
never joined forces and worked with Pete

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No one told you to give content to OSSTMM.
</I>&gt;<i> We were discussing in &quot;taking&quot; content from OSSTMM acknowledging  
</I>&gt;<i> the source and have OSSTMM &quot;refer&quot; to code within OWASP.
