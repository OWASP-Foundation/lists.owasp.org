Subject: FW: Presentation on the new Testing Guide

 

Hi,

 

Just wanted to let you know that the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) and others are actively looking at the Testing Guide.  They asked
me (last minute) to talk about it at one of their SwA working group
meetings.

 

&gt;<i> Congratulations on version 2 of the OWASP Testing Guide!
</I>
&gt;<i> It is an impressive and informative document that will
</I>
&gt;<i> greatly benefit the software development community.
</I>
&gt;<i> Joe Jarzombek, the Deputy Director for Software Assurance
</I>
&gt;<i> at DHS, as well as myself (as co-chair of the DHS Software Assurance
</I>
&gt;<i> Technology, Tools and Product Evaluation Working Group)
</I>
&gt;<i> are wondering if you would be interested in presenting the Testing
</I>
&gt;<i> Guide at the upcoming DHS SwA workshop at CTC Incorporated ( in
</I>
&gt;<i> Annapolis Junction) on Monday January 22.
</I>
 

Here is the presentation I gave.

It talks briefly about the Testing Guide, and then goes on to discuss
the broader issues related to HOW we build a body of knowledge about
application security, the OWASP approach, and why the traditional
approaches are doomed.  I hope you like it.

 

Please forward me any feedback you have on the presentation, as I'm sure
it's not the last time.
