<PRE>Matteo, thank you very much for such elequent argument on the collaboration
between OWASP and ISECOM, which I completely agree.

Let's remember that the objective here is to guive the OWASP Testing Guide
users the best available resource and information. So it makes all sense to
put in there references, comparions and notes on other similar works that
might be of value to the OWASP Testing Guide readers.

Let's build bridges here since I'm sure ISECOM users will also benefit from
the OWAPS Guide.

Matteo got it spot on here: &quot;Someone at OSSTMM did a very good job in some
area, we here did a bunch of VERY GOOD work in another. Let's just sit and
find out how to share this knowledge and come out with a finished product
that is better than the single part and yet tokk us a fraction of the total
time a rewrite would have taken. &quot;.

So I proposed that we include a section (couple pages) in the OWASP Testing
Guide about the areas that ISECOM document are worth looking at. And this
pages should actually be co-writen by somebody from ISECOM. Matteo can you
see if Pete Herzog can help?

Let's all have a group virtual hug now.... :)

Great stuff, great debate, I like this new OWASP :)
