Morning all,

I have not forgotten about the testing guide, it's just that I'm  
overloaded for the next two weeks due to a training course im giving  
in Nashville (and hence trying to get prepared)

Rest assured, as soon as this is finished, ill send out the various  
sections

Thanks

Daniel

Morning all,

Sorry for the short break in the testing guide progress, the real  
world caught up with me.
Attached are the documents needed for the next part of the guide, and  
they are:

Testing Guide II Structure.doc

This is the final TOC as we agreed and next to each section, there is  
the option to add your name and your e-mail address(i.e you will be  
writing this section)

template1.htm

If you could structure all your submissions using this template (you  
can use any format you like, word/text/xml, as long as i can read it  
on a mac!)

Guidelines for creating sections:

- DO NOT DO A STRAIGHT COPY FROM ANY OTHER SOURCES ON THE WEB!
Plagiarism won't be accepted.
This testing guide should reflect the experience you all have in  
application testing. One of the benefits of OWASP is that the wealth  
of experience from the contributors enables the reader to understand  
the section they are reading, as it is presented in a well structured  
format, which unlike a large amount of research papers on the web  
today, isn't normally the case.

- Try and use examples where possible and also let other "non- 
security" individuals read what you have written. This ensures that  
it makes sense to everyone and not just the hardcore penetration  
testers out there.

- I understand everyone has a life and work commitments, so please  
don't select loads of sections if you know you may not be able to  
commit to them in the end run.

- Contact me if you have any issues during this next phase


I think we should aim to have all the sections written by mid August,  
how does this sound for everyone?

Obviously if you feel there is a section missing from the TOC, by all  
means contact me

Look forward to seeing the work coming in

Daniel Cuthbert

Thanks Victor

SQL injection is an interesting one as the section is potentially huge
Would you mind making sure that the following are covered if possible

- standard sql injection
- stored procedure injection with sql 2000
- blind sql injection
- mysql/post gres injection
- mitigating circumstances

Hi Dan,

I have attached my name to all the SQL Injection related sections. I
can add the most value in these sections given my personal research.
I could help with other parts if needed (like other kinds of
injection), let me know.

Best regards,
Victor

Hey Daniel,
 
I would like to volunteer for the authentication section. I could take
up the first half that talks about the authentication mechanism itself,
or both parts including the session management mechanism. 
 
For any information about myself and/or my experience you are welcome to
contact me.

I haven't put a word limit on the sections, so feel free to go as  
deep as you need to (ill be editing them to make it flow etc, so no  
worries about that)

On another note, for a list that has over 80 people subscribed, ive  
only seen 4 offers!
I will give it a week and the people who havent contacted me, will be  
removed from the list. Yes this is harsh but this isnt a freeloading  
list and it does require input from everyone on the list (work/time  
constraints are taken into consideration)

Cool shall have a draft to you in the next two weeks.

Regarding contribution, Actually I have the same problem with people coming 
to meetings.
It seems to me people are joining OWASP so they can say on their CV's 
"member of OWASP" but they dont contribute at all.

Eoin

Daniel,

I understand your will to push people to help, but I think that the lack of volunteers so far is not just a matter of "freeloaders". My perception is that there are some other issues involved, here: people that are not native english speakers, for instance, or people that feel that their technical skills are not enough to take full care of a whole section but that still are willing to help.

About me, I can provide added value on authentication, input injection and encryption sections, but because of time (and probably "language") constraints, I am not sure I can take "a real 100% lead" on any of them ;)

cheers

Alberto

I haven't put a word limit on the sections, so feel free to go as  
deep as you need to (ill be editing them to make it flow etc, so no  
worries about that)

On another note, for a list that has over 80 people subscribed, ive  
only seen 4 offers!
I will give it a week and the people who havent contacted me, will be  
removed from the list. Yes this is harsh but this isnt a freeloading  
list and it does require input from everyone on the list (work/time  
constraints are taken into consideration)

Morning all,

Sorry for the short break in the testing guide progress, the real  
world caught up with me.
Attached are the documents needed for the next part of the guide, and  
they are:

Testing Guide II Structure.doc

This is the final TOC as we agreed and next to each section, there is  
the option to add your name and your e-mail address(i.e you will be  
writing this section)

template1.htm

If you could structure all your submissions using this template (you  
can use any format you like, word/text/xml, as long as i can read it  
on a mac!)

Guidelines for creating sections:

- DO NOT DO A STRAIGHT COPY FROM ANY OTHER SOURCES ON THE WEB!
Plagiarism won't be accepted.
This testing guide should reflect the experience you all have in  
application testing. One of the benefits of OWASP is that the wealth  
of experience from the contributors enables the reader to understand  
the section they are reading, as it is presented in a well structured  
format, which unlike a large amount of research papers on the web  
today, isn't normally the case.

- Try and use examples where possible and also let other "non- 
security" individuals read what you have written. This ensures that  
it makes sense to everyone and not just the hardcore penetration  
testers out there.

- I understand everyone has a life and work commitments, so please  
don't select loads of sections if you know you may not be able to  
commit to them in the end run.

- Contact me if you have any issues during this next phase


I think we should aim to have all the sections written by mid August,  
how does this sound for everyone?

Obviously if you feel there is a section missing from the TOC, by all  
means contact me

Look forward to seeing the work coming in

Daniel Cuthbert

I can take a whack at the encryption issues section; I spent almost a year
reviewing a series of applications that relied heavily on crypto to protect
data.  During that time I identified a number of areas for improvement.

What kind of timeline are we expecting for completion? (Need to know how
much time to set aside to work on this).

Regards,

Yvan

Hi Dan,

No problem covering the points you mention. In fact, as you say, this may
turn up to be a very large section if I include all that I have on SQL
Injection. I would nevertheless add to what you suggest:
- Ways to determine DB engine type
- Oracle and DB2 injection
- IDS evasion
- Some checklist to determine injection type and risk level

What do you think I should NOT include?
- For example: I think it should NOT be a SQL injection course for
beginners, but more of a specific, incremental and step by step methodology
to get to understand the query, privileges and capabilities to assess the
potential risk. I think it should assume SQL and database specific working
knowledge.

There is also some overlap with fuzzing, code review (for the whitebox part)
and encryption. How will we coordinate our efforts so that we don't end
writing several times similar things.

Hi,

I would like to:
1) put in a section on reporting results (after Analyzing results ?)
2) help with the overall review

I do not agree with the free-loader remark: one of the reasons I
subscribed to this list is to stay current on progress and report this
in the Belgium Chapter meetings (being the Chapter leader).

Regards,

Seba

Morning all,

Sorry for the short break in the testing guide progress, the real world
caught up with me.
Attached are the documents needed for the next part of the guide, and
they are:

Testing Guide II Structure.doc

This is the final TOC as we agreed and next to each section, there is
the option to add your name and your e-mail address(i.e you will be
writing this section)

template1.htm

If you could structure all your submissions using this template (you can
use any format you like, word/text/xml, as long as i can read it on a
mac!)

Guidelines for creating sections:

- DO NOT DO A STRAIGHT COPY FROM ANY OTHER SOURCES ON THE WEB!
Plagiarism won't be accepted.
This testing guide should reflect the experience you all have in
application testing. One of the benefits of OWASP is that the wealth of
experience from the contributors enables the reader to understand the
section they are reading, as it is presented in a well structured
format, which unlike a large amount of research papers on the web today,
isn't normally the case.

- Try and use examples where possible and also let other "non- security"
individuals read what you have written. This ensures that it makes sense
to everyone and not just the hardcore penetration testers out there.

- I understand everyone has a life and work commitments, so please don't
select loads of sections if you know you may not be able to commit to
them in the end run.

- Contact me if you have any issues during this next phase


I think we should aim to have all the sections written by mid August,
how does this sound for everyone?

Obviously if you feel there is a section missing from the TOC, by all
means contact me

Look forward to seeing the work coming in

Daniel Cuthbert

Hi all,

There seems to be a misunderstanding of what i meant by the remark
Ever since the Testing guide started, we have had more people on the  
list than people giving input. I can name over 40 people who are  
subscribed to this list who have never posted 1 message or offered  
any form of input.

There are the few individuals who do give input all the time, and i  
really do appreciate them.
It seems currently there are a load of people who now say they are  
"part of the owasp testing guide" but dont really give/do anything

Daniel

Daniel,

I volunteer for the "Configuration Management Infrastructure" section.
I may cover all the subsections with the exception of the following, for
which I believe there may be someone more authoritative than me
?	Web services used (SOAP/XML etc) [ ]
?	Known Content Management Systems (CMS) systems in place? [ ]

Regards to all,

of the doc

You may not agree with me but here I go (again):

<rant>

Reporting results to a client can fall into one of either two categories.
1. Acceptance of the findings and risk evaluation level (Low, Medium High)
2. Non-Acceptance of the findings or Risk eval level.

"sticking to ones Guns" regarding an analyists opinion of the risk and bad 
practice may not be what the client wants to hear.
They may wish for you to downgrade the risk level, or they may say "Trusted 
users use this application only" in order to lower the perception of any 
risk.

This can be difficult and to keep a client happy, who is paying you. What 
does one do? (We all would like repeat business.)
In my opinion one should NOT, Never, No Way dilute the results. Being 
careful on the words used in the executive summary is of paramount 
importance to explain the risk but not be alarmst.

Push it out by a month.
review shall be difficult and updates may take more than one iteration.

Maybe suggest initial drafts of the sections to be in by Mid Aug.
Select a review panel (otherwise it shall be chaos).

Dan you have final say when a chapter is stable and "Gold standard" state.

Everyone try and do their sections when they can, if you finish it  
next week or by end of august im happy

I assume that their names will not be on the authors/contributors list of the Guide. They won't have much to claim at that point, will they ?

As a side note, Daniel, I will help Matteo Meucci on the Cookie Manipulation part. I remain available for helping on Authentication, Encryption and Input Injection.

Eoin,

I agree with you here: what we deliver as report is our analysis. 
Whatever the 'customer' wants to do with it internally is his own
business , but like you say: We have to stick to our guns.
It is however critically important that during a reporting cycle the
results have been validated with the customer - preferably technical -
people before a final report is presented to management. Otherwise you
immediately end up in acceptance problems. 
This does also mean that the reporting has to be very clear on the
results and should be limited to factual things. So refrain from any
subjective standpoints!

Regards,

Seba

I agree with this; client reporting is designed to present a list of
findings to the client!  If they want to stick their heads in the sand after
you give them the report and ignore it, that is their prerogative.

If you trim out and customize information to pacify management you have
moved yourself into being part of the problem, not part of the solution.  In
the past the reports I have done have never rescinded analysis of issues;
rather they include all of the steps taken to mitigate the issues since
discovered.  

My clients have preferred this (with some prodding :P) because they can use
it to show that they are not actually being proactive.  Proper explanation
of this and ensuring that clients up front can relieve the pressure of this
with a difficult client.

Regards,
Yvan Boily

Dan,
	Since I'm working on this as we speak for an Internet Banking
site, the Authentication section, "Weak Forgot Password Implementation"
section sounds good if no one else has taken it already. I'll also add
the "Weak PIN or password requirements..." section as well.  I'm
working.  I my also be able to provide some input on "Input Validation"
as it relates to XSS or any of the other validation issues.  If whom
ever is going to take that section wants to collaborate, that would be
great!

	Been out for a while since I got married, I'm back now though :)

Cheers,
	Raf

Morning all,

Sorry for the short break in the testing guide progress, the real world
caught up with me.
Attached are the documents needed for the next part of the guide, and
they are:

Testing Guide II Structure.doc

This is the final TOC as we agreed and next to each section, there is
the option to add your name and your e-mail address(i.e you will be
writing this section)

template1.htm

If you could structure all your submissions using this template (you can
use any format you like, word/text/xml, as long as i can read it on a
mac!)

Guidelines for creating sections:

- DO NOT DO A STRAIGHT COPY FROM ANY OTHER SOURCES ON THE WEB!
Plagiarism won't be accepted.
This testing guide should reflect the experience you all have in
application testing. One of the benefits of OWASP is that the wealth of
experience from the contributors enables the reader to understand the
section they are reading, as it is presented in a well structured
format, which unlike a large amount of research papers on the web today,
isn't normally the case.

- Try and use examples where possible and also let other "non- security"
individuals read what you have written. This ensures that it makes sense
to everyone and not just the hardcore penetration testers out there.

- I understand everyone has a life and work commitments, so please don't
select loads of sections if you know you may not be able to commit to
them in the end run.

- Contact me if you have any issues during this next phase


I think we should aim to have all the sections written by mid August,
how does this sound for everyone?

Obviously if you feel there is a section missing from the TOC, by all
means contact me

Look forward to seeing the work coming in

Daniel Cuthbert

Well, that's one big OpenSource question. How do you control the
results.
The best way is to work with people you already have experience with,
and assign team-leaders to every section.
Another option which seems to work in this case is a review panel which
will have to work very hard..
 
In addition, I am a strong believer of brainstorming and mutual-reviews,
although when many people are involved this could lead to chaos.

Daniel,
Is there a copy of the Testing Guide Structure available anywhere on the web? I've looked on the OWASP site and on the source-force lists but can't find a copy :-( If not, would you ok with adding it, possibly to the Docs section of the sourceforge site for the mailing list? This might help other people as well :-)

Thanks

I agree.. itz always better to form smaller groups with a team-lead for each
section and share.. Also let us start working now on respective topics while
we discuss about quality of documents.....

Hey Dan,
remember the discussion regarding the time estimation for a pen test?

Did anyone consider "Function Point Analysis" to do this.
FPA is a way to measure the size of a system. I'm no expert in this but 
maybe someone else is?

"Function Point Analysis has been proven as a reliable method for measuring 
the size of computer software. In addition to measuring output, Function 
Point Analysis is extremely useful in estimating projects, managing change 
of scope, measuring productivity, and communicating functional requirements"

Peer review.  As long as the document receives a high level of review from
all contributors it should be pretty good.  Everyone contributing for
sections has a stake in the final project, and I may only be speaking for
myself, but if the crypto section I am planning to write is published along

For the first testing document we published, myself & a tech-writer we
have on staff here both went through the document and helped to make
sure it was good to go from a formatting, grammar, and tone point of
view.  I will certainly be available for such work again, and I might be
able to get the tech-writer resource again for an editing pass once it's
complete.

For technical comprehensiveness and accuracy, that's certainly going to
come from peer review of all the subject matter experts in the group.

Agreed, we need peer review.
But if we have 40 reviewers who's comments/ideas make it to the final draft 
and how do we manage this?
Not everyone is going to agree on everything so we may need a mediator to 
make an executive decision or what?

I agree on the high level with what you said, however - it might turn
out to be unpractical.
There are always as many opinions as people involved, and this seems
like a mess we don't want.
However, this is only my own opinion and maybe I'm too pessimistic.

Peer review.  As long as the document receives a high level of review
from
all contributors it should be pretty good.  Everyone contributing for
sections has a stake in the final project, and I may only be speaking
for
myself, but if the crypto section I am planning to write is published
along
side other peoples work I will be reviewing the entire body of work as
pedantically as I review my own work.
 
I would hope that others will do the same thing.

Phew.. Never going to make it to the office if people keep responding to my
emails this quickly!

The best solution would be (imho) for each person who is planning to
contribute to make a list of key competencies; from this list, each writer
selects 2-3 reviewers.  E.g.  I would look for 2-3 others out of the 40 who
have an understanding of crypto to review my work.  The people doing SQL
injection would look through that list and select a few people.  This way we
are not writing a document by committee; nothing ever works by committee :P

Just a thought..

Regards,

Yvan Boily

.. Off to work ;)

exactly what's been taken and what still needs contributors at this

Hi all,

There seems to be a misunderstanding of what i meant by the remark Ever
since the Testing guide started, we have had more people on the list
than people giving input. I can name over 40 people who are subscribed
to this list who have never posted 1 message or offered any form of
input.

There are the few individuals who do give input all the time, and i
really do appreciate them.
It seems currently there are a load of people who now say they are "part
of the owasp testing guide" but dont really give/do anything

Daniel

I've just done such a thing, but the mail has been blocked due to size 
and is pending moderator approval.

Ok. Count me in for the:

- Methodologies -> Penetration Testing
- Configuration Management Infraestructure
- Configuration Management Application

I could possibly contribute to some other sections but I'd rather 
peer-review them than write them myself :-)

We should be reusing some of the content we developed when we wanted 
to tackle the testing guide first. We already developed content 
related to testing of:

- Authentication
- Cross Site Scripting
- Default files
- Directory Traversal
- OS Command Injection
- Backup and Unreference files

For those who were not present at the time (that was November 2003) 
all of those are available at 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/owasp/testing/
Please reuse them, if possible.

I've taken some time to put together all of the current section 
volunters (myself included). Attached is the latest document version.
Handling this through e-mail is a little bit messy,  wouldn't it be 
best to handle this through some kind of wiki or CVS we could all 
write to?

In any case, Daniel, I think we should setup a timeline with 
appropiate deadlines. How about this one:

--------------------------------------------------------
August 1st - first version of the volunteered sections
[ peer review of sections, detection of who is not active, decission 
to offer up sections to others if people are overloaded, etc ]

August 15th - final version of the sections
[ peer review of sections, editorial changes ]

August 29th - first document draft (all sections put together)

[ peer review of the document]

September 5th - final release of section 2
---------------------------------------------------------------

Does it sound reasonable?

Regards

Javier

yes please, remember the difference between the OWASP docs and the  
other books/resources out there, is that we actually explain the  
issue in a better way. I would love for everyone to use screenshots,  
data flow diagrams (DFD's) etc.

If the point can be made using these, by all means, use them

Can i make one small suggestion?
We concentrate on the actual content first, and when its nearly time  
for the peer review, we act on that then?
Otherwise we will get bogged down with the logistics of reviewing  
even before anything is done

Thanks to Javier, here is the timeline:

--------------------------------------------------------
August 1st - first version of the volunteered sections
[ peer review of sections, detection of who is not active, decission

August 15th - final version of the sections

August 31st - first document draft (all sections put together)

[ peer review of the document]

September 30th - final release of section 2
---------------------------------------------------------------

You will notice the date of release has been extended, as i know it  
will not be done in 2 weeks :0)

Also.. the name of this guide will become the OWASP Guide to Web  
Application Penetration Testing. For us to even try and call it a  
testing guide, when in reality it has always been a penetration test  
guide, is just mad. We don't, and won't, cover all aspects of web  
application testing and this document should represent that.

I will be sending out an updated structure doc with everyones names soon

Hi Dan

Before you re-publish this document with the following statement in it:
"Token storage? (If not marked as 'secure' a cookie will be stored on
hard disk)"

Please can you change it, as it is NOT correct - which I tried to
explain before:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11721627

The storage / caching of cookies & http content can be influenced by
the "Max-Age=" attribute of the "Set-Cookie:" header, or the
"Pragma:", "Expires:" and "Cache-Control:" headers (for caching
proxies) - it is NOT affected by the "secure" attribute of the
"Set-Cookie:" header [which is intended to stop a end-user client from
sending a cookie value over HTTP, i.e. unencrypted].

Refer to:
 http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2109.html
 sections:
- 4.2.2  Set-Cookie Syntax
 - 4.2.3  Controlling Caching
- 10.1.2  Expires and Max-Age
 - 10.2  Caching and HTTP/1.0

Also, reference should be made to other RFC's, like:
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html

Perhaps I could be involved in / run with the "Token storage" section
of the testing guide.  Perhaps I should also put my name down for the
"Improper use of cache control directives" section.
I would also like to offer assistance with other sections, like SQL &
XSS injection sections, Parameter analysis, Bypassing logon process,
and Parameter Manipulation sections like HTTP header manipulation and
URL parameters.

Cheers
Steve

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] WAVA vs Pentest
Message-ID: <39a4a99c050624014138909ad4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

When I raised this point before, I didn't get much in the way of
responses. Perhaps you all might take a moment now to comment on or
discuss these suggestions of mine?
I also refer you to:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11512183
and
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11513842

Basically I am proposing that it could be better to use the term
Application Vulnerability Assessment (AVA), or in this specific case:
Web Application Vulnerability Assessment (WAVA), instead of the term
Pentest.

So we'd call the guide the "OWASP Guide to Web Application
Vulnerability Assessments" instead of the "OWASP Guide to Web
Application Penetration Testing", and within the guide we'd use
headings like (see: the template1.htm published with the latest
"Testing_Guide_II_structure.doc"):
 - Anonymous or Unauthenticated user perspective [short version: Anonymous]
 - Authenticated or logged in user perspective [short: Authenticated]
 - Auditor or Full access perspective [short: Auditor]
instead of:
 - Black Box; and
 - White Box

Some motivations for these ideas, including:
1. I find that customer non-technical executives understand the term
"Vulnerability Assessment" better than "Pentest"
2. Pentest has more connotations of a negative nature, or associations
with terms like "hacking" and "trying to break the system", whereas
"Vulnerability Assessments" is a term that seems convey more positive
ideas like what we're really trying to do here: i.e. help identify
weaknesses so they can be resolved effectively.
3. Also, terms like "Anonymous", "Authenticated" and "Auditor" are
understood better by non-technical people than the terms "Black Box"
and "White box"

Also, following on from this, there would obviously be a need to
explain the terms within the Testing guide introduction / overview
sections.

Also, I feel that the template1.htm (published with the latest
"Testing_Guide_II_structure.doc") could be updated to include the
sections:
How to Test -> Anonymous perspective; Authenticated perspective; and
Auditor perspective
instead of currently: How to Test -> Black Box; and White Box

Also, the "Short Description of Issue" section could include a "Short
statement with reference to Anonymous, Authenticated and Auditor
perspectives" after the basic outline of the issue - for example an
SQL Injection issue identified in an ASP page that you cannot access
unless you have successfully authenticated, then the issue (as well as
the remediation measure) are not applicable for the anonymous user
perspective [but it does expose the system to serious risk with
respect to authenticated users].

Also, couldn't there perhaps be another section like "Short
description of the remediation options", e.g. input validation
controls to be build into the application, or an application firewall
/ filter, or better password complexity checking, or things like that?
Perhaps this section could also consider the differences between
Anonymous, Authenticated and Auditor perspectives ? e.g. when testing
for SQL Injection in an ASP page that you cannot access unless you are
authenticated, then the issue as well as the remediation measure are
not applicable for the anonymous user perspective, but if the SQL
injection occurs in the login screen / page of the app, then it places
the system and organisation at risk from anonymous users.

Regards,
Steve

Also.. the name of this guide will become the OWASP Guide to Web 
Application Penetration Testing. For us to even try and call it a 
testing guide, when in reality it has always been a penetration test 
guide, is just mad. We don't, and won't, cover all aspects of web 
application testing and this document should represent that.

I will be sending out an updated structure doc with everyones names soon

Im not sure about the term vulnerability assessments, to me, it has  
always been used by consultancies who do not have the knowledge of  
advanced penetration testing, and use tools like nessus to find  
vulnerabilities (but not exploit them)

Also black box and white box testing is used throughout the industry  
and i REALLY dont want the word audit anywhere, as there is a massive  
difference between an audit function and a security review (speaking  
from experience here being an ex KPMG person)

Remember this guide isnt meant for non-technical people, its aimed at  
professionals who need to test their applications for security issues.

Ok Daniel,
I've two questions:
1) The title: "OWASP Guide to Web Application Penetration Testing"
Why not: "OWASP Guide to Web Application Vulnerability Assessment"
I think "WAVA" is more suitable.
2) Time line: in Italy from 1st August to 15th everything is closed,
and also all the people are in vacation...

Just my thought.
Mat

Here is how the two terms have always been seen in the industry:

vulnerability assessment -> find the security hole BUT do not exploit  
the hole to prove its exploitable
penetration test -> find the security hole and try and exploit/gain  
access as much as possible

Are we saying that this guide will only give the 1st steps for  
finding the hole, but not how to gain further access into the  
application

an example would be:

input form vulnerable to sql injection
--> add %27 to determine impact
   --> add ; exec master..xp_cmdShell 'net user OWASP /add' --
    --> then execute ; exec master..xp_cmdShell 'net localgroup  
administrators OWASP /add' --
    --> and then add the user with admin priv's within the db itself

See if we are only going to show how to do the 1st step, then how  
would someone actually know if it was possible to exploit the app

The problem today is that there are way too many consultants out  
there who are "vulnerability assessors", but actually have no clue on  
how to take the test to the next step

How does it sound "WAPT"?

I understand your opinion but I think that is important:
- to distinguish the Network PT from WebApp PT (or VA): 
I think PT is more suitable for the Network level, VA is more suitable
 for the Application level.
- give a document that will be the standard "de facto": if the term
WAVA is more diffused than WAPT, I think we have to choose the first
one.

Message-ID: <98103656952FCA45B9AC2BCD50474C1802B41435@to1mbxs03.replynet.prv>

I prefer to use "penetration testing" too.

Whether it is correct or not, "vulnerability assessment" is more and more used to indicate automated scans that only scratch the surface of what is to be tested.

I have never had the impression that "penetration testing" could convey a negative impression (at least here in Italy). But IMHO it would not be a problem anyway, since this Guide is meant to be a practical resource for security professionals and not a marketing tool targeted to customers. 

...and "WAPT" sounds good to me

Im not sure about the term vulnerability assessments, to me, it has
always been used by consultancies who do not have the knowledge of
advanced penetration testing, and use tools like nessus to find
vulnerabilities (but not exploit them)

Also black box and white box testing is used throughout the industry
and i REALLY dont want the word audit anywhere, as there is a massive
difference between an audit function and a security review (speaking
from experience here being an ex KPMG person)

Remember this guide isnt meant for non-technical people, its aimed at
professionals who need to test their applications for security issues.

We tend to use the term 'penetration test' for impact, but
(application|infrastructure) security assessment as the actual description.

We're heading for a more all encompassing security review of web-applications
through this methodology than 'vulnerability assessment' would imply, and I
agree that it's more an infrastructure related term.  As Dan says,
vulnerability assessment is, in my experience, used to define the more
automated approach to security assessments, and OWASP is very much driven by a
more skilled and manual methodology.

While terms including the word 'hack' may have negative connotations to some,
I've rarely experienced anyone who feels the same way about 'penetration
testing'.

Im with you Dan.
Audit is not a great word given the amount of popularity compliance audit is 
getting.
Pent test was always the politically correct word for  what we do?

We cant go ahead and redeifine these functions.

Where did you get "think PT is more suitable for the Network level, VA is 
more suitable for the Application level." This is not the industry view.

If we want industry buy in we need to adopt industry nomenclature and not 
reinvent the wheel.
Anyways the doc is not a "hacking 101" doc its an attempt to standardize pen 
testing functionality and hence quality of what OWASP endorses?

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] WAVA vs Pentest

Please don't get hung up on specific word - I don't care if we don't
use the word audit, use the term "super user perspective" or "Admin
perspective" or "Code review perspective".

Also, any issues you identify in a web app review have to be
demonstrated via showing the exploit in one way or another. Whether it
is called pentest or vulnerability assessment, does not stop the
assessor from doing the job he's meant to do.

Can you explain how the section in the guide "Finding specific
Vulnerabilities using Source Code Review" is more suited under the
banner of "pentest" than "vulnerability assessment"? Is this activity
not performed during a "code review" [aka "Audit"]? Unless it is a
client-side applet that you download, or you have fully compromised
the server, you would have to get authorised "super user access" or
"Admin Access" or "Code review perspective" access to the code to
assess it.

Also, is it more efficient to try to assess the risks associated with
things like "Process permissions" via locally host reviewing (aka
"auditing") the box, or via first trying to compromising it?

This document is covering more things than just the brute force way of
doing things.  I thought it was about showing the wide variety of
perspectives and options - with the ultimate aim of allowing people to
chooses the most effective, and efficient ways of demonstrating
weaknesses so that they may be fixed properly - and quickly.
Pentesting is not the only means of achieving that goal. Is it? It
certainly does play a large role, but my point is that pentesting it
is not the only activity involved.

Ok this is my point of view. I think this is the industry point of view.
I also think that we are few to think of WAVA instead of WAPT, so we
can close the thread and go on.

     I agree on the closed point, lets rather get some sections done  
and then decide on the merits of calling it what it is?

Hi Daniel,

Could i take up the section on buffer overflows i.e Heap, stack and
format. I can also help out with the code review part of buffer
overflows.

Regards
Varun

Morning all,

Hope the weekend was good?
Attached is the list of who is doing what, so far...

As you can see, the main sections still with no love are:

- Authentication (session based)
- Application DoS
- Access Control
- Input validation (OS/LDAP/Debug/Null bytes/Unicode)
- Language specific (Perl/PHP/J2EE/c)


If no-one puts their hands up, i'll do them.

Please remember that explanation of these techniques is paramount,  
and if you can use what ever suits your skillset to explain them all.

Any issues, let me know

Daniel

Hi Dan,

I guess I'd volunteered for the J2EE bit too..... In the language

How can you say the session issues have no love?
I said I'll do both parts!

Morning all,

Hope the weekend was good?
Attached is the list of who is doing what, so far...

As you can see, the main sections still with no love are:

- Authentication (session based)
- Application DoS
- Access Control
- Input validation (OS/LDAP/Debug/Null bytes/Unicode)
- Language specific (Perl/PHP/J2EE/c)


If no-one puts their hands up, i'll do them.

Please remember that explanation of these techniques is paramount,  
and if you can use what ever suits your skillset to explain them all.

Any issues, let me know

Daniel

I'm happy to do the Application DoS once I've given you a reasonable version 
of the sections on threat modelling - we can't have you overworking :-)

	The application level DoS is something I can take a shot at, and
I've not yet volunteered for anything else yet.  I should be able to
leverage some other existing work I've done on the subject.

Larry,
I'm happy for you to take this on, maybe I can help out as and when suits 
you. My first skill and greatest experience is in software performance and 
performance testing so I have some experience in how to overload 
applications :-)

Julian
