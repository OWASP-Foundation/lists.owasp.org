Hi All,

I'm gathering everyone is nearly recharded after the festive season, and
ready to get the 2nd phase started?
I've attached the outline so far, there are some new topics which should
be added and some which need to be tweaked.

For the next 2/3 weeks, can everyone who is on this list, please have a
look at the content and start giving ideas?

If we can have this index wrapped up by end of Jan, then i can start
splitting the sections so everyone can work on their chosen subject.

Cheers,

Daniel

Hi Daniel,
I think you should add nikto to the tools section (Appendix E). It will come 
in very handy in the Configuration Management Application section.

there was a fair amount of talk about adding tools such as nikto/nmap and
nessus to this document previously, but im happy to open it up again

nikto does have some good points and with ver 2 in development, yeah i can
see it needing to be in there.

For a list which has over 70 people subscribed, its pretty silent in here?

I am less familiar with Nikto, but we use Nessus extensively and we have
found that it has a good deal of overlap (for web application deployment
configuration management) with some of the expensive and proprietary
tools like Kavado in that it does checks for some versioning and
configuration issues for web servers (default apps, IIS .dlls available,
etc)

For the purposes of the OWASP testing guide I would imagine that ports
80 and 443 would be the dividing line between the output we "care" about
from tools like Nessus, Nikto and nmap.  I suppose there are
recommendations that go beyond that (don't run mail from the same server
that you run web from, etc) but that would put the guide on a slippery
slope that will probably outpace the community's ability to develop and
maintain relevant content.  Also, in-depth host-level security
recommendations should be readily available from other sources.

That's a fair estimation.  This is my first post and I've been lurking
for a while...

So in the interest of putting my money(time) where my mouth is I will
volunteer to write a "Using Nessus for Application Security Testing"
section for the Part II Testing Guide.  My caveat is that my schedule is
a complete disaster until mid February, so I probably won't have it
finished until late/end of February.  As long as that works for everyone
I will put this in my calendar.

Thanks,


Dan

Nobody here but us mice.

I'm toying with the idea of updating the session paper I put together a
while back for the project, and pulling together a similar one for
authentication and authorisation.

We've come on a fair way both with our internal testing and the OWASP
testing framework, so the session management one definitely needs some
updates.

This has got me thinking now about other guides we should include.
How many people here use SPIKE (the fuzzer, not the proxy) when performing
app tests?

Also, maybe we should include a section on using proxies?

     I think covering proxies at a generic level is a good idea.  It's
such a fundamental part of any good testing program.

     I've never used SPIKE as a fuzzer or a proxy.  We use our own
in-house tool.

I was using WebProxy (@stake), it includes a fuzzer and some other useful
tools.


> Also, maybe we should include a section on using proxies?
I think it's a good idea to write about general proxy concept for
penetration testers. Also there is another nice tool for simple penetration
testing: "Mini Browser" 

Currently it's an integrated application with website watcher
(http://www.aignes.com/ ), a small browser which uses IE and you can modify
request/cookies etc. on the fly. May we should explain basic type of tools
(proxies, fuzzers, browsers, Browser based extensions like Firefox
LiveHeaders etc.) with some samples.

If readers can understand these tool categories, there is no need to tell
them about usage, most of them are really easy to use.

Hello Jeff

As promised here is the OWASP FAQ translation to
Spanish language. Please upload it to sourceforge
site.  Since this document is only available as web
page, I was wondering how you posting it in OWASP
portal.  Maybe Sangita can add a new question like: Is
this FAQ available is other languages?.  At least
until we have OWASP Portal translation. :)

I want to thank Alberto Pena for his effort in this
translation.

Regards,
JC
