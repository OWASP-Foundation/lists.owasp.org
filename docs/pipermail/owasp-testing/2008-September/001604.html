<PRE>Marco,
About section 4.8.1, please note that following the popup example there is
another example where the victim downloads an executable file (.exe) of the
attacker's choice.

&gt;<i> Hello list!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've completed a read-through of the guide (except a few sections toward
</I>&gt;<i> the end), changing some things along the way (mostly to fix typos or
</I>&gt;<i> clarify paragraphs: yes, sorry for all those minor edits :-)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some more notes/comments, which hopefully should be
</I>&gt;<i> addressable in a short
</I>&gt;<i> time (the number refers to the chapter/section, &quot;all&quot; means it is
</I>&gt;<i> applicable to the whole content):
</I>&gt;<i> all: There should be a standard format for references: different sections
</I>&gt;<i> use different styles (e.g., inline, footnote).
</I>&gt;<i> all: Remove all references to part 1/part 2 of the guide and use
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate chapter numbers instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 2: It refers to a detailed threat modeling methodology (&quot;Part 2 of the
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP Testing Guide (the detailed 'How To' text) will outline a specific
</I>&gt;<i> Threat Modeling methodology&quot;), which doesn't seem to exist
</I>&gt;<i> The paragraph &quot;A Note about Static Source Code Review Tools&quot; is very
</I>&gt;<i> confusing (what is the code, what is the undefined variable temp?): it
</I>&gt;<i> should either be improved substantially or be removed.
</I>&gt;<i> Before the section on Security requirements, there is a link to the TOC:
</I>&gt;<i> is that supposed to be there?
</I>&gt;<i> What is meant by &quot;application security frame categorization&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;From the defect management and reporting perspective, software quality
</I>&gt;<i> and security testing can leverage similar issue categorizations and
</I>&gt;<i> metrics&quot;: not clear
</I>&gt;<i> Section 3 and Section 4 are a bit disconnected. It probably
</I>&gt;<i> would be good to have a paragraph to introduce Section 4, so that it is
</I>&gt;<i> clear why it's there. For example, something along the lines of &quot;if you
</I>&gt;<i> want to have a successful testing program, you need to know what are the
</I>&gt;<i> objectives of the testing. These objectives are specified by security
</I>&gt;<i> requirements. This section discusses...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Some parts of the last section overlap with the content of
</I>&gt;<i> the next chapter.
</I>&gt;<i> 3: The figure could be improved: the text in the boxes is not always
</I>&gt;<i> aligned consistently (sometimes it's left-aligned, sometimes it's
</I>&gt;<i> centered); fonts in the figure should be used consistently; some of the
</I>&gt;<i> boxes in the figure do not correspond to any part of the text
</I>&gt;<i> 4: The list of contents at the beginning of section 4 should be kept
</I>&gt;<i> synchronized with the general table of content. For example, the section
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;AJAX Testing&quot; in the ToC is missing in the list of the section.
</I>&gt;<i> 4.1: The introduction should probably be modified to reflect the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that this is a chapter in the testing guide, rather than a guide on its
</I>&gt;<i> own.
</I>&gt;<i> Capitalization is not used consistently in the table.
</I>&gt;<i> The term &quot;gates&quot; seems non standard and later sections use &quot;entry points&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 4.2.4: The section is titled &quot;web application fingerprint&quot;, but its
</I>&gt;<i> content focuses only of fingerprinting &quot;web servers&quot;: I think either
</I>&gt;<i> the title should be changed, or the content should be updated with
</I>&gt;<i> similar techniques for fingerprinting web applications.
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8: &quot;break the pattern&quot;: unclear
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OS commanding&quot; is non standard, better &quot;OS command injection&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In most of the sections, testing follows a 3-step process: identify
</I>&gt;<i> attack vectors; determine if sanitization can be bypassed; perform the
</I>&gt;<i> actual injection: should the sections have a more standardized structure
</I>&gt;<i> to reflect this?
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.1: Would it be good to have at least one example of attack that shows
</I>&gt;<i> something else than creating a popup?
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.3: To be finished
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.4: To be done
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.5.2: &quot;The single Quotes Problem&quot; paragraph is not very clear
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;direct SQL injection could be easily accomplished at a level
</I>&gt;<i> depth depending primarily on mysql version&quot;: unclear
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Note: there is no way to bypass single quotes outstanding filename&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> unclear
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.5.4: &quot;Blind sql injection vulnerabilities are by no mean the most
</I>&gt;<i> frequent type of vulnerability&quot;: not clear if they are frequent or not
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.12: should be expanded to talk about file injection (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> include/require in PHP) and dynamic evaluation of code (e.g., eval)?
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.13: should the example be clarified, e.g., to specify that the
</I>&gt;<i> application passes the user input to a function like system() or open()?
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.14: format string is not a buffer overflow. Also, what about
</I>&gt;<i> integer overflow vulnerabilities?
</I>&gt;<i> Should this section mention more sophisticated defense mechanisms?
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.14.1: The last reference seems wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> There are non-printable characters in the last &lt;pre&gt; section
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.14.2: The description of stack overflow seems quite basic. Should we
</I>&gt;<i> add more sophisticated attack techniques?
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.15: &quot;incubated&quot; seems a non standard term: should it be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;persistent&quot; or similar instead?
</I>&gt;<i> 4.9.1: This seems to mix two different problems: one is insufficient
</I>&gt;<i> validation allows a user to force the DB to scan the entire table; the
</I>&gt;<i> second are algorithmic complexity attacks. See more detailed comment at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Talk:Testing_for_SQL_Wildcard_Attacks">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Talk:Testing_for_SQL_Wildcard_Attacks</A>
