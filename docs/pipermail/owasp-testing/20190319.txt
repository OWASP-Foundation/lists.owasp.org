Subject: [Owasp-testing] [WARNING] The Owasp-testing mail list will be
	retired on March 22nd and no longer available
Message-ID: <201903192200.x2JM0eVo023877@lists.owasp.org>

Sorry to intrude on your mail list again but I need to remind the Owasp-testing list members that the OWASP Foundation is shutting down all the mail lists run by Mailman on lists.owasp.org on March 22, 2019. After that date, emails to the list will be rejected.

Here is a one-click link to join the new Google Group which is replacing this list:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/testing-guide-project/join

You can also join by sending an email to testing-guide-project+subscribe at owasp.org

The new Group is also available online at:
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/testing-guide-project

Detailed Information on how join the Group is at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TBzgvB8Tb0aAZnEy2qYzLnrzJuRzK_T91Em09DVf5YA

NOTE:  You are NOT required to have a Google account, an @owasp.org email address, or to provide your phone number to join and participate in the new Group at testing-guide-project at owasp.org - just an email address.

Finally, full details on the plan to retire Mailman, links and FAQs are  at: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL

Thanks for your past and future contributions to our community!
