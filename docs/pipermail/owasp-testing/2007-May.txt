Now that 2.0 is out, who wants to talk about version 3?

The way i see it is that we need to take the spectacular efforts from  
1.0 -> 2.0 and make 3.0 into a fully fledged adult which not only  
explains the technical side but also includes aspects that many  
guides often forget about, such as:

- Managing security testing teams
- Working with UAT and change control
- Managing expectations


Thoughts?

I agree. Workflow and process management is a significant cause of failed
attempts.

I do have a question on version two. On page 31 there is an excellent
workflow diagram. My concern may be more philosophical, but penetration
testing is placed in the deployment phase. While this is a reflection of the
present reality, I think the previous part of the document makes a case for
testing early. The last 25% of the development phase is an excellent place
to perform a penetration test. When unit and integration testing are
complete (or even earlier) and there is a functional application running in
a test or certification environment this could also be a point in the
workflow where testing can (and should IMHO) begin. In the deployment phase
construction/coding is done. As a result, implementing changes after a code
freeze or a push to production is quite the challenge in some environments.
A test or certification environment although volatile offers a path to
fixing issues prior to deployment. To ease the pain that is caused by a
dynamic environment such as dev or test, a certification environment offers
the relative stability and opportunity to submit defects and see them
corrected prior to deployment.

Hi folks,

I?m about to get going on the OWASP Guide 3.0 ? I?ve sent a message a few
weeks ago and have a few volunteers. For the next version, I?d like to have
parity in both, and to do that is a bit of work. One of the things to help
progress is to set a date. I propose the following schedule:

OWASP US Conference is October this year. Gives us six months
OWASP EU Conference is May next year. Gives us twelve months

I think we can have a 2.5 edition by October, and a 3.0 by next year. What
do folks think? I personally do not have the time I once did, so basically
I?d prefer the 12 month schedule and get things right the first time.

There?s a lot of testing material in the OWASP Guide, which I would like to
selectively dump into the Testing Guide. This will give you feature parity
with the Guide, and in turn, I need to pick up a few of the things in the
Testing Guide for the Guide.

In the Testing Guide 3.0, please make room for an authorization section.
This was missed (how?) in 2.0. The basics will include a few things in
already in the Testing Guide 2.0, and a few things from the OWASP Guide, but
will at the very least encompass:

* Complete mediation ? everything is access controlled
* Forced Browsing. We?re settling on this term as WASC are also starting to
use it. This is where a pre-constructed request (GET, POST, whatever) is
sent to the browser and it works. This is typical of hidden / optional links
and buttons common in most programs
* CSRF 
* Course grained authorization - isAuthenticated(), which is typically all
products like SiteMinder and WebSeal tell you unless you start using their
advanced features. This is insufficient
* Medium grained authorization (isUserInRole()). Could be considered
business logic access control
* Fine grained authorization (is the current secured resource record or
current secured function sub-feature OK for the current user). Could be
considered data layer access control.
* Architecture to incorporate authZ checks at the client, presentation,
business and data layers. This is important with Ajax applications (I?ve
seen this issue this very week. I can?t go into details, but it is end of
application class of attack).

Dave Wichers wants all the Guides to be in what I call ?SFA? format. When I
complete the injection chapter, I?ll demonstrate what needs to happen here.
Luckily, your content is closer to this format than the Guide. However, SFA
favors Wiki than documents. For many, the Wiki is the way to go, and I agree
... When you?re online. But many folks like it being in printed form and
that also helps when you?re doing a review where you?re not allowed to use
your own computer or the Internet.

Dinis and myself are looking for a decent publisher now. I?ve set a few
minimum standards to ensure that OWASP materials in published form do not
lose us our copyright and gain us maximum funds whilst allowing us to keep
the Wiki / PDF versions around for free. Most publishers will not touch this
and therefore, we need to choose from the remaining publishers carefully.

Thanks,
Andrew

Agreed, this time-scale seems acheivable

Will add this to the page

I'm in Australia this week, so will create the wiki entry and also  
start the process
