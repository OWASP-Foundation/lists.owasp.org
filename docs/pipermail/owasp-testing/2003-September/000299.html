<PRE>It is very unfortunate to see this mail from you Mark. I wish i could take
the responsibility, but i dont think i have that great skills to manage this
project.  

But, if any senior person is taking the responsibility then i can definitely
take the initiative to assist them. 

To all other members of this wonderful project, please co-operate and take
this further up the ladder. We just cant see our dream baby going away
without coming into the world.

Your Partner in Learning,

Success is a wonderful thing, but never underestimate the value of Failure.
Failure teaches many more things than success ever can.

</I>&gt;<i> Guys,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> It is with dissapointment that I have to say I have absolutely no idea now
</I>&gt;<i> how to track David Endler down or what stage this project is at. I have
</I>&gt;<i> left him voice mail and email for the last two weeks but to no avail. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> We have tried over the last 18 months to get this going and now with two
</I>&gt;<i> significant false starts, I am not sure I have any optimism for it left
</I>&gt;<i> and am drawing the conclusion that it maybe one we just have to put down
</I>&gt;<i> to experience. This is of course a shame as this is much needed work and
</I>&gt;<i> in much demand, but without a driver making it happen it will sit in this
</I>&gt;<i> state forever and given the significant progress other projects are making
</I>&gt;<i> it is not conclusive to good housekeeping to have an inactive project.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> If there is anyone who feels they have the time, commitment, skills and
</I>&gt;<i> motivation to take the helm and make this happen pretty quick, then please
</I>&gt;<i> contact me within the next week. If not I am afraid to say we are going to
</I>&gt;<i> have to delete it. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to all of you who put effort into the project and I am personally
</I>&gt;<i> sorry it appears to have died a slow and painful death. I will try and
</I>&gt;<i> salvage what work was done in some way in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> FYI - The Guide is coming along very nicely. This too hit some sticky
</I>&gt;<i> patches. Thanks mainly to 4 (read small group) now spending a significant
</I>&gt;<i> amount of time on producing version 2, it will be a great read. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards and again thanks for your efforts,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
</I>
