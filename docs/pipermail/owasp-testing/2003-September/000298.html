<PRE>I'm happy to play an active part in this one - but I'm off to Thailand
for a month tomorrow and won't be back on-line until mid October.

I'll get back in touch then and offer my services!

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Testing Project


Guys,
 
It is with dissapointment that I have to say I have absolutely no idea
now how to track David Endler down or what stage this project is at. I
have left him voice mail and email for the last two weeks but to no
avail. 
 
We have tried over the last 18 months to get this going and now with two
significant false starts, I am not sure I have any optimism for it left
and am drawing the conclusion that it maybe one we just have to put down
to experience. This is of course a shame as this is much needed work and
in much demand, but without a driver making it happen it will sit in
this state forever and given the significant progress other projects are
making it is not conclusive to good housekeeping to have an inactive
project.
 
If there is anyone who feels they have the time, commitment, skills and
motivation to take the helm and make this happen pretty quick, then
please contact me within the next week. If not I am afraid to say we are
going to have to delete it. 
 
Thanks to all of you who put effort into the project and I am personally
sorry it appears to have died a slow and painful death. I will try and
salvage what work was done in some way in the future.
 
FYI - The Guide is coming along very nicely. This too hit some sticky
patches. Thanks mainly to 4 (read small group) now spending a
significant amount of time on producing version 2, it will be a great
read. 
 
Kind regards and again thanks for your efforts,
 
 
Mark
