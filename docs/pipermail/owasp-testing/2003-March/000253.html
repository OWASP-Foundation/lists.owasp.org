<PRE>Agree. I think what is being suggested about ensuring we keep in sync
makes a lot of sense and ensuring testing focuses on testing also seems
smart. 

Overall I think the aim wasn't to prescribe testing as black box or
white box or whatever, it was more to describe each discipline that you
might consider, highlight the pros and cons of each, describe when each
may be appropriate, and describe a process and technique proceedures to
undertake each and them. 

Does that seem sensible and accurate? 

Given its much easier to bite off small chunks at a time I would suggest
we focus on those first four chapters for now. This is what I think the
intent of them was.

Chapter 1 - Introduction - obvious. Use the Guide format. 
Chapter 2 - What is a Web Application or Web Service ? - set the scene
and make the book complete for someone who is reading it in isolation or
needs the chapter for context. Refer to the OWASP Guide as the
definitive reference. Pull content directly from the Guide.

So that leaves US with the first two REAL chapters for this project of
Why Test and The OWASP Testing Methodology. I think 3 is relatively easy
and 4 will see hot debate ;-) And rightly so.

Chapter 3 - Why Test ? - Objective: discuss the reasons why you would
want to test. Jeremy's point is well taken, there maybe more. Perhaps
create a Chapter 3 document on its own and start iterating improvements
? Dave, are you the keeper for any updates ? If we can put it into
DocBook chapter by Chapter and in CVS it will be a whole lot easier. I
know I go from DocBook hater to lover but it really is working well for
the Guide project now ;-)

Chapter 4 - Objective to define a structured methodology that could be
adopted for how to decide, Why, When, What and How to test your target
site / applications. Now I have written that I have convinced myself
Chapter 3 is a sub section of Chapter 4. What struck me when I re-read
the heading and subheadings was we kinda prescribed a right way and a
wrong way. I think thats the Phase word that indicates serialization. I
think its more a case of here are the things you should consider and
heres some tips that can help you arrive about your answer. Thats not to
say some things aren't logically before others. Clearly a plan is a good
idea and theres no point in creating  that afterwards right.

Anyways Dave, what do you day about chapter by chapter. I am sure we can
all knock out the Methodology in a few weeks of online debate ?

PS The portal architect is off this week coding it up. It really is
close but is a lot of week. It will get pounded and were damn determined
its going to be as secure as it can be. As you know we spoke about this
being serialize chapter by Chapter month by month for the rest of the
year. Thats still the best thing to do but I would hate for this to
start on the crappy html site we have today. I will chat to David
Raphael and see if we can do the xslt for the first 3 chapters if you
agree 1 is Intro, 2 is what are web apps and 3 is methodology. When
thats agreed I'll personally do the CVS docbook entries.

</I>&gt;<i> Take from this what you want.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I know we can't and don't want to attempt to list every technology that
</I>&gt;<i> can be used in web development.  However a category or type of technology
</I>&gt;<i> that seems to be missing in the diagram and text is the use of rich web
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces such as Java applets or ActiveX controls.  I'm not sure if that
</I>&gt;<i> is an oversight or an intended omission.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Most of the notes I started making and the comments to the list seem to
</I>&gt;<i> revolve around the use of technologies and where they fit in the
</I>&gt;<i> architecture of a web application.  I think we need to be careful not to
</I>&gt;<i> fall into a &quot;can't see the forest for the trees&quot; issue.  I'm not sure what
</I>&gt;<i> the full scope of where we are going to take web application security
</I>&gt;<i> testing, but it seems like that should dictate the depth of understanding of
</I>&gt;<i> web application architecture that is required.  For example, if we are going
</I>&gt;<i> to focus on &quot;black box&quot; or pen testing or looking at the application from an
</I>&gt;<i> attacker's perspective, the only tier of the application that is required
</I>&gt;<i> for us to understand would be the presentation tier.  The remaining tiers
</I>&gt;<i> would actually become a potential target for the test, i.e. can we determine
</I>&gt;<i> how the rest of the application is architected and does that expose other
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, if we are going to &quot;expand&quot; the scope of testing to
</I>&gt;<i> include code reviews, testing of components such as EJBs or COM for which we
</I>&gt;<i> need to create a test harness, etc., we obviously have to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> architecture more fully.  These types of tests sometimes can only be done by
</I>&gt;<i> the developers of the application.  For example, some of our customers only
</I>&gt;<i> have us conduct &quot;black box&quot; assessments, while others give us full access to
</I>&gt;<i> the source code, environment, etc.  I'm sure the rest of you would have
</I>&gt;<i> similar stories.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In short (realizing I passed that point 2 paragraphs ago), I feel that we
</I>&gt;<i> should focus on those things necessary to establish, implement and evaluate
</I>&gt;<i> the testing process and leave anything extraneous to that for other groups
</I>&gt;<i> to handle.  If we need to show the architecture of the web application in a
</I>&gt;<i> similar fashion to what we are now doing, we must keep in sync with what
</I>&gt;<i> other OWASP projects, such as the Guide are doing.  I think Mark mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> this in his comments, and this will be an ongoing struggle for the OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> leadership, but minimizing the instances where OWASP documents may be in
</I>&gt;<i> conflict will be something we will have to stay focused on as each project
</I>&gt;<i> matures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) In the five common reasons to test a web application, what I feel is
</I>&gt;<i> often the main reason is either missing or doesn't jump out to me.  It seems
</I>&gt;<i> like the main reason we test is to try to locate our security
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities, whether they are design or implementation problems, before
</I>&gt;<i> an attacker exploits them.  Our applications are constantly being &quot;tested&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> by attackers.  That could possibly fit into one of the reasons listed, and
</I>&gt;<i> while it may seem pretty basic, I think it's important to come out and say
</I>&gt;<i> something about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, those are my initial thoughts.  I'm really looking forward to how
</I>&gt;<i> this document fleshes out over the next year.
