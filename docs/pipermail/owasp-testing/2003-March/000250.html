<PRE>A number of comments on the intro section...

1.	Following the discussion on where ASP, and JSP fit, I think that it is important to identify where the technologies were supposed to be used, rather than where they are being used.  Both ASP and JSP (and for that matter PHP) were designed as presentation layer technologies.  ASP was designed to work with COM components to do the application tier logic, JSP was designed to work with Java classes (aka Java Beans) and initially PHP wasn't designed to do any back end processing.  Before I get shot down for this comment, a lot has changed since then and these languages have advanced considerably, so perhaps they do belong in the Application tier.  My preference is to see ASP and JSP in the presentation tier and their associated technologies ie COM/COM+/Serviced Components and Java beans, in the application tier

2.	Section &quot;What are Web Applications&quot;
	
	Replace &quot;developed at the Speed of Light&quot; with &quot;evolved at a staggering rate&quot; - Speed of Light is a bit to SciFi for a professional document
	
	Replace &quot;Java (or Similar Language)&quot; with &quot;an object-oriented language&quot; - More generalist

	Replace &quot;Through Complex Business logic tiers&quot; with &quot;Using complex business logic&quot; - Use of tier is unnecessary


3.	Rearrangement of paragraphs - The &quot;What are Web Services&quot; section should be before the paragraph starting &quot;It can help to think of a web application....&quot;.  A new section heading should be inserted after this section titled &quot;3-Tiers of logic&quot; or something similar.  Web Services really only differ from web applications in the presentation tier, instead of displaying data via a web browser they pass data via a remote method call.  Instead of being viewed by a human user (ie web application), web services are consumed by other applications/services.

	To this end, I would also reword the paragraph &quot;It can help to think of a web application being made up of three logical tiers or functions&quot; to &quot;Most modern applcations can be divided into three logical tiers or functions&quot;.  The three tier separation is becoming more common in even desktop applications where the GUI is separated from the functional classes, which is separate from the data/persistence layer.

4.	Section &quot;Presentation Tier&quot;

	Replace &quot;Presentation Tiers are responsible&quot; with The presentation tier is responsible&quot;

	Replace &quot;It may also include application compoenets that create the page layout&quot; with It may also include components that determine the presentation logic and create the page layout.

5.	Section &quot;Data tier&quot;

	Should be renamed &quot;Persistence Tier&quot; - The other two layers talk about &quot;Presentation&quot; (The way things are presented) and &quot;Application&quot; (The logic that brings the data together).  Following this format the word &quot;Persisence&quot; (The way data is stored) is more consistent than data (what is being stored).

6.	Section &quot;Application Security Development Lifecycle&quot;

	Ammend &quot;Those tasks ... development and testing&quot; to &quot;Those tasks ... development, testing, deployment, maintenance and retirement&quot; - The deployment and maintenance areas are especially important as it is these areas that security is of upmost importance as there is real data involved.  The omission of the last three sections in a lifecycle is one of the most common and unforgivable mistakes that any software engineer can make!!


Anyway, there is enough ramblings from me.  They are just my thoughts, so take what you want from it.

Cheers

Nick

Page 11

I think everyone's on the same page but just so we are clear jsp's are
compiled the first time they are called into effectively regular
servlets. The old model pre jdk1.2 was more like asp and php.

With this and asp.net and code behind things are a little more blurry
but I guess the original point was to  discuss why mixing presentation
and business logic is not a good idea for security (web server gets
rooted, loose applications as well).

The new owasp guide (draft) has a good new section on this and
architectures that its worth syncing up with. You can check it out of
cvs.
