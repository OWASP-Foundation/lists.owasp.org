<PRE>Attached is the latest draft of the Testing document in RTF format.  The
conversion was a little quirky from OpenOffice, so certain
sections are capitalized.  There is still MUCH to do, but I would like to
define a
staggered release schedule of chapters to allow us to edit in a timely and
effective manner, focusing on specific portions methodically.  The
following release schedule is what I had in mind.  I'm not completely sure
if this
is too aggresive, or not aggresive enough, but we can always adjust the
timeframe.  Thoughts?

I'll be sending specific requests for the first release cluster later
tonight.  The first release I imagine will be the easiest to get ready for
prime time publication. Thanks for your continued patience and support:
