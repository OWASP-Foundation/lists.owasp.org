<PRE>Here is my feedback on the first section.

1. Page 10 says, &quot;The functions performed can range form relatively simple tasks like...&quot;  &quot;Form&quot; should be &quot;from&quot;.

2. Page 11 - Can we get a better resolution graphic?  I can barely make out the text.

3. Page 11 - It looks like ASP is in the presentation tier of the graphic.  I think this should be in the application tier.  Entire web apps have been written in ASP.  According to your definition for the application tier it fits there.  ASP handles the user input, making decisions, and obtaining more data.  PHP is in the application tier; ASP and PHP are very similar.  I don't know much about Java server pages, but perhaps they also belong in the application tier.

4. Page 11 - We should add a non-browser application to the leftmost list in the presentation tier.  Something like FrontPage or Word.  Most people realize the web browser uses the web, but they may not realize their desktop office productivity application do too.

5. Page 12 - &quot;A Data Tier is used to store things needed by the application and acts as a repository for both temporary and permanent data. It is the bank vault or database of a web application. Modern systems are typically now storing data in XML format for interoperability with other system and sources.
Of course small applications may consist of a simple CGI running on a local host; reading or writing files to disk.&quot;  
This makes it sound like a database, local files, and XML are separate things.  The XML format is used in both files and databases.  Perhaps the wording should be, &quot;A Data Tier is used to read and store things needed by the application and acts as a repository for both temporary and permanent data. This data can be read and stored in local files or a database.  Modern systems are typically now formatting the data as XML for interoperability with other system and sources.&quot;

6. Page 13 - &quot;The most effective way to strengthen the security of a web application is to include security testing as an integral part of the development lifecycle.&quot;  I think this statement is a little overboard.  While security testing is extremely important, I would argue that secure design and coding practices are just as important if not more.  Security should be thought of in all stages of the product cycle, but security testing does happen until you have designed and coded something.  During the design phase threat modeling is pretty important; secure coding practices and security awareness is important during implementation.  These are not usually referred to as testing.  Let's change this to &quot;An important way to strengthen...&quot; or &quot;One effective way to strengthen...&quot;?

7. Page 14 - Should we include something about P3P since we are talking about policies and P3P is a web related policy?

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Uncle OWASP needs YOU!

Hi all,

I really want to adhere to the schedule set forth for release, so would
appreciate your feedback ASAP.  Please share your comments/sugguestions with
the rest of the list by this weekend so I can develop a decent merging and
editing of the document to go out by April 1.  Even if it's a small comment!
Still looking for an updated graphic and more concrete regulatory examples.

I've added a few people to our list who have kindly agreed to volunteer some
time with the peer review process. If it's your first posting, feel free to
introduce yourself. THANKS,

-dave
