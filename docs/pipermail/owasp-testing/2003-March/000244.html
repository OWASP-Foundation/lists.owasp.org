<PRE>I have reviewed the first release David made on the OWASP Testing 
methodology. I'm adding some comments below on issues which might or 
might not be relevant to the document.

Hopefully the comments will be useful to the people who have written the 
document.

Best Regards

------------------------------- Start Comments ----------------------

[1] page 4
People have probably spotted this, but, anyway, the table of contents 
includes a full paragraph between the page references. Probably a 
problem with the styles:

&quot;Unicode	54
A Tester should ensure in the source code that some security checking 
should is carried out after UTF-8 decoding is completed. &quot;

[2] page 6
The following line:
&quot;There are many different publicly available checklists one can download 
on how to securely deploy specific web technologies (erg. Apache, IIS, 
iPlanet, etc.), &quot;
could probably be changed to:
&quot;There are many different publicly available checklists one can download 
on how to securely deploy specific web technologies (erg. installing 
Apache, IIS or iPlanet, developing in Java, VisualBasic or PHP, etc.), &quot;

Otherwise the example is too specific, IMHO, to checklists related to 
vendor (web server) products and undermines the phrase.

[3] page 8

I do not agree completely with this statement:

&quot;(...) was started in September of 2001. At the time there was no 
central place where developers and security professionals could learn 
how to build secure web applications or test the security of their 
products. (...)&quot;

Related to secure web applications the World Wide Web Consortium has had 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Security/">http://www.w3.org/Security/</A> for quite some time. Also the WWW Security 
FAQ has been provided since 1995. As for security testing, the OSSTMM 
first version, for example, was published in april 2001 and had a (very 
small) section on web application testing. Granted, OWASP has 
spearheaded the web security effort since then and now produces far 
better information that those sources.

Maybe the paragraph should be changed to

&quot;(...) was started in September of 2001. At the time the information 
available for developers and security professionals where they could 
learn how to build secure web applications or test the security of their 
products was fairly insufficient. Although documentation such as the WWW 
Consortium's &quot;WWW Security FAQ&quot; and the OSTMM from (at that time) 
Ideahamster organisation were a start, they did not provide sufficient 
in depth information for professionals and, in some cases, had been 
obsoleted by new emerging technologies. (...)&quot;

[4] page 10

&quot;The Application Tier may include technology like CGI's, Java, .NET 
services, PHP or ColdFusion &quot;

I would not include CGI as a technology since it is, essentially, a 
specification, as described at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/CGI/.">http://www.w3.org/CGI/.</A> CGI has, IMHO, 
been (wrongly) used as a reference to scripts that implemented (at the 
time) the specification, i.e. shell/perl/C scripts. The CGI interface is 
used, however, by .NET services, PHP aplications, ASPs...

I would rephrase that as:
&quot;The Application Tier may include the use of specifications such as CGI 
or SOAP and technologies like interpreted scripts, Java applications, 
.NET services, PHP or ColdFusion.&quot;

[5] page 11

&quot;Of course small applications may consist of a simple CGI running on a 
local host; reading or writing files to disk. &quot;

Again a bad use of the CGI term IMHO. Why not rephrase it to:

&quot;Of course small applications may consist of a simple script running on 
a local host; communicating through CGI with the web server and reading 
or writing files to disk. &quot;

[6] page 13

Related to the regulatory requirements:

&quot;Financial institutions have regulatory requirements from the FDIC or 
OCC for Internet banking , see for example the very general and vague (...)&quot;

should be changed to:

&quot;At the US, financial institutions have regulatory requirements from the 
FDIC or OCC for Internet banking , see for example the very general and 
vague ....&quot;

I believe it would also be relevant to add a note on the European 
Directive 95/46/EC: &quot;on the protection of individuals with regard to the 
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data&quot;
<A HREF="http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/privacy/index_en.htm">http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/privacy/index_en.htm</A>

Which states:

&quot;Article 17
Security of processing
1. Member States shall provide that the controller must implement 
appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal 
data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, 
alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the 
processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against 
all other unlawful forms of processing.&quot;

This directive has been converted into a law in all European countries. 
Meaning that companies which use personal data as part of an e-commerce 
service might be legally liable if anything of the above occurs. This is 
pretty similar to the HIPAA and very relevant to web applications which 
usually make use of databases including personal information which 
should be protected from attack.

[7] page 15

I think that a note on what is currently done in web application 
security might be useful here to drive a point. As you all are aware 
security testing in web deployments are currently primarily based on 
&quot;penetration tests&quot; (a.k.a. security black box analysis) of the web 
services deployed.

This is usually flashy (&quot;I was able to retrieve you whole customer 
database from the Internet&quot;) but it's far from sufficient if you want to 
make sure that applications are secure and will stay that way (i.e. 
application developers will not make the same mistakes again, web 
services will be deployed following security guidelines). Maybe a 
footnote on this could be added to the following paragraph or before in 
the text when describing the different security testing phases:

&quot;Implementation Review and Testing -  An implementation review involves 
actual testing of the security of the application as implemented (often 
called grey or black box testing).&quot;


[8]

Overall I think this section gives a good introduction on what web 
services are and what the current needs are. However, I would like it to 
link or reference information from third parties. It is very 
OWASP-specific and seems to say &quot;before us, nothing was done on the web 
security area&quot;.

It would be proper, IMHO, to talk slightly more about previous works and 
to current works which might be related to the OWASP effort.

Some samples:

- The yet to be released OSSTMM version 3 includes much more information 
on web application testing guidelines and tools (version 2.0 provides 
already much more than 1.0)

- NIST has produced some outstanding documents on overall security, 
security testing (maybe too network specific) and web applications too. 
Take a look at NIST SP-800-44: 
<A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-44/sp800-44.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-44/sp800-44.pdf</A>
(it might be too specific to the products and OS itself, not the 
applications, but it's part of what OWASP testing is about)

- SANS is trying to produce a web application check list
<A HREF="http://www.sans.org/score/webappschecklist.php">http://www.sans.org/score/webappschecklist.php</A> as part of the SCORE project.

- IntersectAlliance has produced some high-quality (IMHO) security 
checklists for web-related applications: 
<A HREF="http://www.intersectalliance.com/projects/">http://www.intersectalliance.com/projects/</A>
