<PRE>Some good comments so far.  I have a few thoughts that I wanted to share.
Take from this what you want.

1) I know we can't and don't want to attempt to list every technology that
can be used in web development.  However a category or type of technology
that seems to be missing in the diagram and text is the use of rich web
interfaces such as Java applets or ActiveX controls.  I'm not sure if that
is an oversight or an intended omission.

2) Most of the notes I started making and the comments to the list seem to
revolve around the use of technologies and where they fit in the
architecture of a web application.  I think we need to be careful not to
fall into a &quot;can't see the forest for the trees&quot; issue.  I'm not sure what
the full scope of where we are going to take web application security
testing, but it seems like that should dictate the depth of understanding of
web application architecture that is required.  For example, if we are going
to focus on &quot;black box&quot; or pen testing or looking at the application from an
attacker's perspective, the only tier of the application that is required
for us to understand would be the presentation tier.  The remaining tiers
would actually become a potential target for the test, i.e. can we determine
how the rest of the application is architected and does that expose other
vulnerabilities.

On the other hand, if we are going to &quot;expand&quot; the scope of testing to
include code reviews, testing of components such as EJBs or COM for which we
need to create a test harness, etc., we obviously have to understand the
architecture more fully.  These types of tests sometimes can only be done by
the developers of the application.  For example, some of our customers only
have us conduct &quot;black box&quot; assessments, while others give us full access to
the source code, environment, etc.  I'm sure the rest of you would have
similar stories.

In short (realizing I passed that point 2 paragraphs ago), I feel that we
should focus on those things necessary to establish, implement and evaluate
the testing process and leave anything extraneous to that for other groups
to handle.  If we need to show the architecture of the web application in a
similar fashion to what we are now doing, we must keep in sync with what
other OWASP projects, such as the Guide are doing.  I think Mark mentioned
this in his comments, and this will be an ongoing struggle for the OWASP
leadership, but minimizing the instances where OWASP documents may be in
conflict will be something we will have to stay focused on as each project
matures.

3) In the five common reasons to test a web application, what I feel is
often the main reason is either missing or doesn't jump out to me.  It seems
like the main reason we test is to try to locate our security
vulnerabilities, whether they are design or implementation problems, before
an attacker exploits them.  Our applications are constantly being &quot;tested&quot;
by attackers.  That could possibly fit into one of the reasons listed, and
while it may seem pretty basic, I think it's important to come out and say
something about it.

Again, those are my initial thoughts.  I'm really looking forward to how
this document fleshes out over the next year.
