<PRE>Some comments on the intro section (some may be repeats of others - sorry).

Where practical I have put underscores to show where changes have been made.

Page 8: Preface, paragraph 1
Word change: To this day, not one web application technology has shown
itself _immune_ to the inevitable discovery of vulnerabilities that affect
its owners' and users' security and privacy.

Also maybe: To this day, _no_ web application technology...


Page 8: Preface, paragraph 3
Missing comma: ...industry derived and proven standard_,_ to system
owners... 


Page 9: About OWASP, paragraph 1
Missing word?: At the same time the commercial marketplace for web
application _security_ started to evolve. 

Word change: ...really only _addressed_ a small portion...

Word change: ...really left _customers_ with a false sense of security.


Page 9: Using this Document, paragraph 1
Singular needs plural: ...TO SECURITY TESTING OF WEB APPLICATION_S_.

Page 9: About the Authors
Reword (removed &quot;and&quot;; added commas): ...for their time, knowledge, and
dedication.

Page 11: Intro - What are web apps
Run on sentences - broke in half: ...INVENTORY MANAGEMENT ACROSS MULTIPLE
VENDORS. FUNCTIONS CAN INCLUDE BOTH BUSINESS TO BUSINESS OR BUSINESS TO
CONSUMER E-COMMERCE, WORK FLOW, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND LEGACY
APPLICATIONS. 

Removed &quot;A&quot;: ...OFTEN CONNECTING TO SIMPLE DATABASES...


Page 12: Presentation Tier
Defined acronym; added comma: THE PRESENTATION TIER INCLUDES WEB SERVERS
LIKE APACHE AND INTERNET INFORMATION SERVER _(IIS)_, AND WEB BROWSERS...


Page 13: Data Tier:
Made plural: ...INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER SYSTEM_S_ AND SOURCES.


Page 13: What are Web Services
General comment: Perhaps include an example of how a Web Service can act
like a client and/or server at any given time.  The Web Service acts like a
server to the end user (i.e. the web browser), but that same Web Service can
act like a client when it requests a service or data from another Web
Service.


Page 14: Application Security Lifecycle
Word choice: ...THAT IS TO SAY THAT TIME _DICTATES_ WHEN SPECIFIC TASKS
SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN. 

Isolate sentence fragment with commas: ...AT ALL STAGES OF AN APPLICATION'S
DEVELOPMENT, FROM REQUIREMENTS GATHERING TO CODING AND DEPLOYMENT, TO ENSURE
THAT...

Page 15: last sentence of &quot;Application Security Lifecycle&quot;
removed comma: ...SECURITY SPECIFIED OR INTENDED IS THAT WHICH IS REALIZED.


Page 15: Industry Best Practice
Add comma to last item in list: ...focus on operating systems, network
infrastructure, and information security management. 


Page 15: Operational Security Lifecycle
remove comma: How does a change in component X affect component Y? 

needed rewording: Security is as good as the weakest link..
Here's my attempt: Security is as good as the weakest link, and therefore
makes logical sense to include security testing of web applications as part
of operational readiness checks. 

needed rewording: Testing should be carried out...
Here's my attempt: Testing should be carried out on a periodic basis, and
when changes occur to the application or its deployment environment.


Page 15: Internal Standard/Policy
made policy plural; added commas to separate list of items: ...defines
policies, standards, and procedures for...

[2nd sentence] slight reword: These policies, standards, and procedures...

Comment: Should &quot;policy&quot; be &quot;policies&quot;?  I don't know if it matters.  I
thought it sounded better plural, but now I'm having doubts.  We need a tech
editor for this :-)


Page 15: Regulatory Requirements

reword needed: Some countries have passed laws that _require_ certain
industries to take _specific_ security provisions.
[Word &quot;certain&quot; was repeated twice in same sentence, and &quot;which&quot; was used
incorrectly.]

added &quot;the&quot;: ...applications called _the_ Cardholder Information Security
Program


Page 16: last sentence for Intro section:

reword: Although none of the above are specifically related to web
applications, regulations and guidelines of this nature are likely to
address web apps in the short term.
