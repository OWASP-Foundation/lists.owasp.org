<PRE>Dave

All looks good. I think its worth explaining the thought was to
serialize testing each month on the new portal. The new portal really is
cool. A rolling demo can often be found at <A HREF="http://12.237.96.109">http://12.237.96.109</A> and it
will move to the owasp dev servers soon. In case thats down heres a
screen shot.

I also wanted to just point out that any work that is submitted for
consideration you are agreeing that it will be copyrighted to the Free
Software Foundation and released under GNU licensing. I know 99% of
everyones fine with that, but there are a few people playing silly
buggers. The layers advise us that as long as we have let everyone know
and given them a chance to object thats all we need to do. So if you
object, please let Dave and I know and well remove your contribution. 

Cheers
