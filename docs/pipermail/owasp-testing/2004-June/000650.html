<PRE>Here goes another suggestion

Do not mix &quot;pure&quot; web application issues with web application infrastructure issues, this is do not mix SQL injection which is a purerly programming (bad) practice with Web Server configuration issues like &quot;HTTP Server banner&quot;. I've always fight for this disctintion to be made.

In my oppinion it is very important to separate OS, HTTP Server, application server (like a servlet engine) and application itself, they are different things and different ways to test them. For example, you hardly will perform a source review on a HTTP Server and only an automated blackbox testing for the &quot;web software&quot;* (very innacurate), but, blackbox tools are very good for http server issues (exploits) and source review for web application.

*Web Software = the web application itself, e.g. a portal made of some php pages (liked this term from Mark)

What do you think people?

Best Regards
JC

Hey all,

Sorry for the silent period, but work and various security conferences 
kinda caught up with me.

With the first phase about to be released, we need to start 
concentrating on the second phase and what will be covered and what 
won't.

So where do we go from here?

Attached is a _very_ rough outline of the different sections i feel 
should be included within this second phase. Now this isn't the final 
structure and I'm hoping we can all have a good debate on what should 
be added within this section.

Take a look at the outline, start the conversation going on this list 
(new people, can you subscribe to the list over at 
<A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-testing">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-testing</A> ) , and lets 
get a framework up and running so i can start asking people which 
section they would like to write/contribute to.

I'll be at the OWASP conference in New York next weekend for a few 
short hours, so feel free to come and chat if you are there

Looking forward to seeing this section grow

Cheers

Daniel
