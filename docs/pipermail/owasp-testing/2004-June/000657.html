<PRE>Juan Carlos, you mentioned the right point. But we go even further in
separating the different aspects of Application Security. Although it
doesn't seem possible to give a clean layered structure where each topic of
Application Security naturally falls into, the following approach has shown
to be helpful.


Layer        Comment, Example
5 - Semantic
    Social Engineering, Phishing, Identity Theft,
    Deception, Forgery, Fraud, Privacy

4 - Application Logic
    Workflow/Controlflow, mapping of Use-Cases.
    Expl: Is the &quot;Password forgotten&quot; function logically
    secure implemented?

3 - Implementation
    Programming Errors in the (custom) web app that
    lead to vulnerabilities like SQL Injection etc.

2 - Technology
    Choice of appropriate means (Expl.: use of hashing
    for tokens)
    Correct use of means (Expl. Hash must have an appropriate
    randomness)

1 - System Software
    Webserver, Application Server, Database,
    other Systems and Services as long as they are part
    of the application as a whole
    The area of &quot;Known Vulnerabilities&quot;

0 - Network and Host
    Ports, Firewall Rules, Internet Services,
    OS Hardening

Environmental &quot;Layers&quot;:

X - Processes and Organization
    Application Security in Software Development Process,
    Enterprise Security Concepts, etc.
    Coding Guidelines

Y - Specific Requirements
    Inhouse, legal, third parties requirements
    Data protection and privay,
    KonTraG/Basel II, HIPAA,...

Notes:
- Layer 2 'Technology' does not really fit into the model of layers, but
nevertheless I think it's ok.
- Layer 0 may be seen as part of Application Security or not. We tend to not
include it and put the interface to the network/host security people above
it. In some cases (perhaps generally?) layer 1 falls out of Application
Security as well.

With this model you can explain for example the use of tools for
pentesting/auditing web applications relative clearly.

Layer 0:
  that's where security scanners like nessus work best
Layer 1:
  network scanners still perform well
  commercial web application scanners like AppScan work best
  human testers perform to some degree
Layer 3:
  already above the capabilities of nessus-like tools
  AppScan-like application scanners are useful tools here
  human expert is absolutely necessary
  Code Reading is appropriate
Layer 4 and 5:
  human expert only, automatic testing not possible


Any comments/improvements to this layer model?

  &gt;
  &gt;
  &gt; Here goes another suggestion
  &gt;
  &gt; Do not mix &quot;pure&quot; web application issues with web application
  &gt; infrastructure issues, this is do not mix SQL injection which
  &gt; is a purerly programming (bad) practice with Web Server
  &gt; configuration issues like &quot;HTTP Server banner&quot;. I've always
  &gt; fight for this disctintion to be made.
  &gt;
  &gt; In my oppinion it is very important to separate OS, HTTP
  &gt; Server, application server (like a servlet engine) and
  &gt; application itself, they are different things and different
  &gt; ways to test them. For example, you hardly will perform a
  &gt; source review on a HTTP Server and only an automated blackbox
  &gt; testing for the &quot;web software&quot;* (very innacurate), but,
  &gt; blackbox tools are very good for http server issues (exploits)
  &gt; and source review for web application.
  &gt;
  &gt; *Web Software = the web application itself, e.g. a portal made
  &gt; of some php pages (liked this term from Mark)
  &gt;
  &gt; What do you think people?
  &gt;
  &gt; Best Regards
  &gt; JC

  &gt; Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] OWASP Testing Guide Phase Two
  &gt;
  &gt;
  &gt; Hey all,
  &gt;
  &gt; Sorry for the silent period, but work and various security conferences
  &gt; kinda caught up with me.
  &gt;
  &gt; With the first phase about to be released, we need to start
  &gt; concentrating on the second phase and what will be covered and what
  &gt; won't.
  &gt;
  &gt; So where do we go from here?
  &gt;
  &gt; Attached is a _very_ rough outline of the different sections i feel
  &gt; should be included within this second phase. Now this isn't the final
  &gt; structure and I'm hoping we can all have a good debate on what should
  &gt; be added within this section.
  &gt;
  &gt; Take a look at the outline, start the conversation going on this list
  &gt; (new people, can you subscribe to the list over at
  &gt; <A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-testing">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-testing</A> ) , and lets
  &gt; get a framework up and running so i can start asking people which
  &gt; section they would like to write/contribute to.
  &gt;
  &gt; I'll be at the OWASP conference in New York next weekend for a few
  &gt; short hours, so feel free to come and chat if you are there
  &gt;
  &gt; Looking forward to seeing this section grow
  &gt;
  &gt; Cheers
  &gt;
  &gt; Daniel
