Yes that's noticeable, I still think though that the original document 
had a more methodology feeling to it though by no means anything finished.

You have no idea how many requests I have received for Endlers original 
document, it was released as a methodology. The two testing documents 
that you currently are working on bears no such title nor objective if I 
have understood it correctly.

It's difficult to do a methodology, but I think it would be fruitful to 
begin such a document after we have the two testing documents in house.

Part 1 is still kind of confuse I think, what is its objective? I see it 
as an introduction to testing web applications but it doesn't say much.

Part 2 on the other hand I understand will be what to test for and how.

In my opinion, only when these two documents are finished, a methodology 
  can be established.

Yes very much so

Congratulations on your session guide btw, very nice work!
