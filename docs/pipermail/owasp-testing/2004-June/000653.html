<PRE>Hi Juan Carlos and the list, 

IMHO, configuration management at application and infraestructura criteria
impacts in a well done application. You can develop a very good application
but you must have it in a correct enviroment. For example, an incorrect
application server configuration, like the posibility of execute servelts by
class instead of mapping it in web.xml could allow execute admin or util
servelts, incorrect logging could bring protection law penalties, etc. in
other hand and not less important, technical infraestructure disclosure its
not a good pratice at all. All this questions have to be test in the
process.

In the guideline of the document these parts are separated but integrate in
the process of testing. The items are general (a web server banner is always
the same for every manufacturer. Sometimes in the testing process you must
adapt the checklist to the minor casualties of your auditing target, like
OS, web server manufacturer, that as you said automated tools identify them
very good, but not if the log its not activated so you have to review it by
hand. 

In this way, and taking your good suggestion we can group the different
issues into the configuration chapters by the part of the infraestructure
that could impact (Web Server, Application server, .. etc) and always
separating of the manufacturer or technology.

Best Regards,

Pablo

Asunto: RE: [OWASP-TESTING] OWASP Testing Guide Phase Two

Here goes another suggestion

Do not mix &quot;pure&quot; web application issues with web application infrastructure
issues, this is do not mix SQL injection which is a purerly programming
(bad) practice with Web Server configuration issues like &quot;HTTP Server
banner&quot;. I've always fight for this disctintion to be made.

In my oppinion it is very important to separate OS, HTTP Server, application
server (like a servlet engine) and application itself, they are different
things and different ways to test them. For example, you hardly will perform
a source review on a HTTP Server and only an automated blackbox testing for
the &quot;web software&quot;* (very innacurate), but, blackbox tools are very good for
http server issues (exploits) and source review for web application.

*Web Software = the web application itself, e.g. a portal made of some php
pages (liked this term from Mark)

What do you think people?

Best Regards
JC

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] OWASP Testing Guide Phase Two


Hey all,

Sorry for the silent period, but work and various security conferences 
kinda caught up with me.

With the first phase about to be released, we need to start 
concentrating on the second phase and what will be covered and what 
won't.

So where do we go from here?

Attached is a _very_ rough outline of the different sections i feel 
should be included within this second phase. Now this isn't the final 
structure and I'm hoping we can all have a good debate on what should 
be added within this section.

Take a look at the outline, start the conversation going on this list 
(new people, can you subscribe to the list over at 
<A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-testing">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/owasp-testing</A> ) , and lets 
get a framework up and running so i can start asking people which 
section they would like to write/contribute to.

I'll be at the OWASP conference in New York next weekend for a few 
short hours, so feel free to come and chat if you are there

Looking forward to seeing this section grow

Cheers

Daniel
