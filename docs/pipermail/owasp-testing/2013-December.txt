Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Testing Guide v4 Final Call
Message-ID: <CAC=o=DYikW78db4EpKZa_y8a1X-5=hTizEaZXRUx60apWeOTFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,
  Matteo and I are in the final stages of collating articles for v4 of the
Testing Guide. On the *15th December* *2013 *we'll be conducting a final
review of all test cases and making decisions about which articles will
make it to v4 and which won't. The community (hey, that's YOU) has put a
HUGE amount of effort into updating the Guide and over the next two weeks
we need to drive it home.

While most articles are taking shape nicely, due to work or personal
commitments, some are struggling. The following articles are candidates for
being cut from v4 and we need folks to adopt them to bring them back from
the brink. If you have the knowledge, time and commitment to write these
articles, then we want to hear from you! Alternatively, if you think they
shouldn't make it to v4, then let us know that too!

4.6.5 Testing for Insecure Direct Object References (OTG-AUTHZ-005)
4.6.6 Testing for Failure to Restrict access to authorized resource
(OTG-AUTHZ-006)
4.6.7 Test privileges of server components (OTG-AUTHZ-007) (e.g. indexing
service, reporting interface, file generator)
4.6.8 Test enforcement of application entry points (OTG-AUTHZ-008)
(including exposure of objects)
4.6.9 Testing for failure to restrict access to authenticated resource
(OTG-AUTHZ-009)
4.7.6 Test Session Token Strength (OTG-SESS-006)
4.7.7 Testing for logout functionality (OTG-SESS-007)
4.7.8 Testing for Session puzzling (OWASP-SM-008)
4.7.8 Test Session Timeout (OTG-SESS-008)
4.7.9 Test multiple concurrent sessions (OTG-SESS-009)
4.8.5 Testing for Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards (OTG-INPVAL-005)
4.8.13.2 Testing for Remote File Inclusion
4.10.4 Testing for Cacheable HTTPS Response (OTG-CRYPST-004)
4.10.5 Test Cache Directives (OTG-CRYPST-005)
4.10.6 Testing for Insecure Cryptographic Storage (OTG-CRYPST-006)
4.10.7 Testing for Sensitive information sent via unencrypted channels
(OTG-CRYPST-007)
4.10.8 Test Cryptographic Key Management (OTG-CRYPST-008)
4.14.2 WS Information Gathering (OTG-WEBSVC-002)
4.14.3 WS Authentication Testing (OTG-WEBSVC-003)
4.14.4 WS Management Interface Testing (OTG-WEBSVC-004)
4.14.5 Weak XML Structure Testing (OTG-WEBSVC-005)
4.14.6 XML Content-Level Testing (OTG-WEBSVC-006)
4.14.7 WS HTTP GET Parameters/REST Testing (OTG-WEBSVC-007)
4.14.8 WS Naughty SOAP Attachment Testing (OTG-WEBSVC-008)
4.14.9 WS Replay/MiTM Testing (OTG-WEBSVC-009)
4.14.10 WS BEPL Testing (OTG-WEBSVC-010)

Remember, we need you to complete articles by *15th December 2013*, so just
take on what you can comfortably handle. The complete list of articles and
their progress can be found in the Paragraph Management spreadsheet on
Google Docs (
https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmEhPtZ0cHq3dDc5ZFI0Nm9oSkhzNkNxTzNJbGdPdVE#gid=0).
Let us know if you'd like access to edit it and we'll help you out.

We're immensely grateful to the folks that have contributed to the Guide.
Its not been easy, but the outcome will be a product that continues to be
used by appsec testers the world over. As a result of the AppSecUSA Project
Summit we're looking at better ways to manage the Testing Guide, like using
Github to manage the project. So if you've got ideas, then get involved!

thanks folks!

Andrew & Matteo

Hello,

I just recently registered on the wiki and subscribed to testing guide. Me and my colleagues would like to help with OTG. My first contribution is to OWASP-EN-002. I added small part on testing ssl/tls enabled services behind http proxy and also did few minor changes. Diff is here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing_for_Weak_SSL%2FTSL_Ciphers%2C_Insufficient_Transport_Layer_Protection_%28OWASP-EN-002%29&diff=164528&oldid=164203

Thanks Tomas.

To the group I understand we're trying to go gold or go live with v4 mid-Dec, however almost every time I look at content I find little bits of wrongness or things that haven't changed since v3. Which may not be the end of the world but I wanted to put it out there. I'm trying to find more time to review content and make contribs but I'm not going to make it for mid-Dec. Perhaps others have accomplished lots lately (I haven't been able to look around even) but I know I haven't been able to spend time on it. How solid is the 15th as our date?

For example in the section Tomas worked on I note:
"Some tools and scanners both free - e.g. SSLAudit [28] or SSLScan [29] and commercial - e.g. Tenable Nessus [27], and other used into examples..."

Which uses "and" multiple times being awkward. So is "...other used into examples...." which needs to be re-written.

That sentence is awkward. I changed the order of tools from ?commercial and free? to ?free and commercial? but did not checked the whole. Sadly I don?t feel like right guy to fix grammar and sentence composition because I am not native english speaker.

I will try to make other contributions in next days.

Tomas,

First of all, thank you for your support!

Just CHARGE and get the content out there. When you are done, point me
at it and I'll "english-wordsmith" it for you. Don't let the language
barrier get in your way!

Aloha,
Jim

The mid-December deadline is for us to understand which articles have sufficient support/content to be included in v4. There are many articles that need work, so we're keen to enlist more authors to increase the maturity of the content. 

If folks can review our previous email about which articles require work, it would be greatly appreciated if folks adopt articles that haven't progressed in preference to fine tuning existing content. 

Regards,
  Andrew

Subject: [Owasp-testing] few comments on v4 content
Message-ID: <D6DFE579-A5CD-49E8-B89F-9E3335F32155@citadelo.com>

Hi,

I wanted to do review of actual OTGv4 state as Andrew asked. Sadly I had not enough time to check it all (yet). So I am sending just few comments.
Please correct me if I understood something incorrectly.


* OTG-AUTHN-006 vs. OTG/CRYPST-004 & OTG-CRYPST-005
AUTHN-006:	Testing for Browser cache weakness
CRYPST-004:	Testing for Cacheable HTTPS Response
CRYPST-005:	Test Cache Directives
CRYPST-005 and CRYPST-004 are empty. I think we should remove them. They would describe basically the same stuff that should be described in AUTHN-006. Wouldn?t they? It is redundant to mention the same stuff in several tests.


* OWASP-EN-001 vs. OTG-CRYPST-002
What is purpose of OWASP-EN-001? Isn?t it redundant to OTG-CRYPST-002?
Or should it contain info on general crypto stuff?
I can imagine describing there issues related to custom signing schemes or custom algorithms in general.
In the past I found such issues (weak custom signature that - offline cracking and revealing private key in short time) but described it as business logic issue. Crypto section is clearly better.


* OTG-IDENT-005 vs. OTG-IDENT-004
I thinks "Weak or unenforced username policy? (OTG-IDENT-005) does not need own test. It should be described within "Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account? (OTG-IDENT-004).
OTG-IDENT-005 in fact has same content that is already in OTG-IDENT-004.
We should:
- either remove OTG-IDENT-005
- or remove "Guessable User Account? part from OTG-IDENT-004


* OTG-CONFIG-010 vs. OTG-CLIENT-004
"Test Frame Options" (OTG-CONFIG-010) is empty but it would cover the same stuff that is already in "Testing for Clickjacking" (OTG-CLIENT-004). Wouldn?t it?
We should remove OTG-CONFIG-010.

* OTG-CLIENT-004 contained information on X-Frame-Options but did not contained info on recommended value (DENY). I added it: https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing_for_Clickjacking_%28OWASP-CS-004%29&diff=164691&oldid=140536


* OWASP OTG-INFO-010 vs. OTG-INFO-002
They are redundant. They actually contain the same content. We should remove one of them (OWASP OTG-INFO-010).


* Test Session Token Strength (OTG-SESS-006)
It is empty. I can write that one.
And also extend part about CSRF tokens - CSRF tokens should have same cryptographic strength (size and entropy) as session id.


* Testing for Weak password policy (OTG-AUTHN-007)
It is not very clear nor verbose.
I think it could be good practice to ban most used passwords, like these ones: http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt
I was thinking about starting project for maintained list of most used passwords. I searched for such project and found this on github: https://gist.github.com/mehlah/3128202
It is maybe worth starting owasp project for this? Maintaining the list of most used passwords observed in leaked lists from past breaches in the world? What do you think?

Regards
