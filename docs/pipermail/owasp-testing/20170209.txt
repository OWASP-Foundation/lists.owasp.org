Hi Team,

 By March 2016 I found a command injection in Google cloud. I termed it as
' client side command injection ' due to application behavior itself.

Please check this link
www.pranav-venkat.com/2016/03/command-injection-which-got-me-6000.html

and let me know if we can include it under command injection category
(sub-category)


Thanks and regards,

So, congrats for the finding the issue.

Reading quickly it seems to be a regular command injection. At the end
of the day, this needs to run at the backend, right?

Hi Ismael,

Command runs in the dedicated docker (cloudshell) which is provided by
Google, So this directly doesn't affect Google data  it just affects
particular user data (eg. appengine files).

Since it is affecting particular client data , I termed it as Client side
command injection.

Do let me know if you have queries,

Thanks,
