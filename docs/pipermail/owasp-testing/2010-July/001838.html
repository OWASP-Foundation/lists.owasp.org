<PRE>I'll volunteer to update the figures (graphics) that are currently in use, something I already done for parts of the v3 material when doing a local print-run. For those who are adding screenshots please upload them at highest possible resolution and let the wiki size them down to screen-size. Some screenshots are horrible at the moment, especially at print size, but haven't got around to fix those yet.

And while I am on the thread, are anyone of you guys gonna turn up at Blackhat/Defcon? I know that I am.

Best regards
Michael Boman

Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Testing Guide v4: start-up

Hi all,
thanks to the OWASP Foundation, it's time to start-up with a new OWASP
Testing Guide project!

Introduction and Project purpose for v4:
============================
The OWASP Testing Guide v3 includes a &quot;best practice&quot; penetration
testing framework which users can implement in their own organizations
and a &quot;low level&quot; penetration testing guide that describes techniques
for testing most common web application and web service security
issues. Nowadays the Testing Guide has become the standard to perform
a Web Application Penetration Testing and many Companies all around
the world have adopted it.
It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that
represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

Project Roadmap
=============
- 1st phase: Brainstorming
18th July 2010: starting a brainstorming with the OWASP Leaders and
project contributors to share goals and project's objectives.
The following are the main improvements we have to realize:
- Inserting new testing techniques, OWASP Top10 update: HTTP Verb
tampering, HTTP Parameter Pollutions, URL Redirection, Insecure Direct
Object References, Insecure Cryptographic Storage, Failure to Restrict
URL Access, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection, Unvalidated
Redirects and Forwards.
- Review and improve all the sections in v3,
- Create a more readable guide, eliminating some sections that are not
really useful, Rationalize some sections as Session Management
Testing,
- Create a new section: Client side security and Firefox extensions testing.
- Create a test case for each test to perform using O2 platform

- 2nd phase: Set-up the team
15th August: Introduce the new project to the OWASP mailing list
seeking for contributors. We need to involve also the final users of
the Testing Guide (for example Banking Companies to understand how
they would like to improve that).

- 3rd phase: Create a new Index
15th September: creating a new table of contents of the OTGv4
assigning a task for each contributor.
Here is the v3 Index:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents</A>

- 4th phase:  Writing and reviewing
1st October 2010: Starting writing
1st November 2010:Starting the first review phase,
15th November 2010: Starting writing articles II phase,
1st December 2010: Starting the second review phase,
15th December 2010: Create the RC1,
15th January 2011: Release the version 4.

1st phase
=======
Now, we are at the 1st phase, and I think this phase it's the most
important to create a solid project as we saw from the last versions.
This time I found really important to open a debate about the following item.

- OWASP vulnerabilities -
The OWASP Testing Guide checklist represents the set of controls to
test: <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist</A>
We divided it into 10 categories (Information Gath, Config. Mng,
Authentication, etc...). For each category we tell what test to
perfom.
The last column tells you what vulnerability you can find if the test
demonstrate a weakness of the application.
Now I see that the list of vulnerabilities is not alligned with all
the OWASP Guides.
Imo the point is that is foundamental to create a list of OWASP
Vulnerabilities shared between the OWASP projects. Why?
Because the OWASP DevGuide, Code Review and Testing Guide should be
linked to this common KB: in this way the 3 projects are linked
between the others and Companies can uderstand for each vuln how to
protect from this vuln (Dev), how to review that code (CR), and how to
test the app running (TG). Then because it is very important for the
Companies have a full list of the possible WebAppSec vulns (I think
there is a lack now).

At this time we have: <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability</A>
But this list does not represents what I mean.
I would like to start from the OWASP Testing Guide checklist and
collect all the vulnerabiities we can find from the last column, add
the new ones. Then maybe Eoin's team should add the white box
vulnerabilities: we know some are the same of the black box
assessment, but others can be found only perfoming a Code Review, for
example &quot;Backdoor in the code&quot;. Then the Dev Guide team should point
to this set of vulnerabilities telling how to write code to protect
the application for each vulnerability.

What do you think about that?

Thanks,
Mat
