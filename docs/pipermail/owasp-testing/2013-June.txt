Hi folks,****

  As I've recently been appointed as Matteo's Test Guide wingman I thought
I would introduce some things I've been working on in relation to the Test
Guide.****

** **

The brainstorming is largely complete and we've started reviewing the
efficacy of test cases. You'll see some suggested ones have disappeared or
changed categories. There were some very cool suggestions that I'd
recommend folks consider during testing (e.g. prod data in pre-prod) but
reflect procedural vulnerabilities rather than software vulnerabilities.
Where possible I've retained the existing test case wording to reduce the
stress of transitioning from v3 to v4, but there are some significant
changes. The major changes include:****

** **

1) Common Numbering - I've leveraged work done by Dave Wichers and Andrew
vd Stock in relation to this and started migrating OWASP test cases into a
new numbering scheme that aligns with their earlier work. The new scheme is
based on defining security control categories and then defining test cases
that test for vulnerabilities related to each control category. However,
you'll find that some of these categories relate to technology rather than
a security control. The inconsistent application of this principle was done
in the interests of usability and familiarity.****

** **

2) Test Case template - I've been working on creating a test case template
that makes understanding, executing, responding to and reporting tests
easier and more consistent.  ****

For example, it would be helpful if test cases were titled according to:****

[Verb] [Object] for [Vulnerability] (e.g. "Test Inputs for SQL Injection")**
**

It would also be helpful to describe a test case by addressing:****

a) summary of vulnerability,****

b) summary of test,****

c) objective of test,****

d) how to test,****

e) example of test,****

f) tools,****

g) references to the Dev Guide for fixing the issue, and****

h) vulnerability references.****

I'm not inclined to change the legacy test case titles just yet, but I ask
for contributors to consider formatting the content test cases in this way.*
***

** **

3) New control categories - Identity Management, Error Handling,
Cryptography, Logging and Client-side security have emerged that either
better categorise existing and new test cases. As with the existing test
cases, not all will apply to every engagement, but we should aim to be as
comprehensive as possible.****

** **

4) Above all, we're not suggesting you stick to the OWASP list of test
cases. Generic test cases will only get us so far, and it is imperative
that security testers develop their own test cases for functionality that
is either highly specific or absent from the OWASP test case list. The Test
Guide is the starting point, not the finishing point. But we hope that
you'll be able to apply the methodology and templates to these as yet
unknown test cases. If you develop a test case you think is particularly
relevant then please consider submitting it to the Test Guide.****

** **

Many thanks to the army of contributors for giving their knowledge and
experience. There is an incredible amount of expertise out there and It
shows in the very high quality updates to the test cases.

I believe many of the changes will serve to improve the quality of the
Guide, but I'm open to feedback on any of the changes to the Test Guide.****

** **

regards,****

** **

  Andrew****

Hi Andrew, have you fully updated that wiki page? Assuming yes and just having a quick look here are a few concerns (some of this is from the related wiki talk page):


1)      It suggests using a document code as element 1. If it's common then no document reference should be required.

2)      Leading things with OCR- seems redundant and just wasteful of space (page space when printing and disk space when saving/generating reports, DBs, etc.)

I can't be sure but to me it doesn't seem like the wiki content accounts for mailing list discussions (though many of them were purely suggestion/consideration based and never really reached any solid conclusion(s)):
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-common-numbering/
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2010-January/date.html#596
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2010-January/000585.html

[I'm sure there is other stuff on the lists as well, that was just a quick check from memory.]

My 2 cents...

Rick

I provided some feedback on the idea. I think there was some non-list
discussion, but some thoughts are in these archived messages:

  http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-common-numbering/2012-July/thread.html

Since then I have had to cross-reference another project with the SCP
Quick Reference Guide, and instead of trying to group each statement
in any way, I simply numbered them OWASP-0001 to OWASP-0250. I suppose
they ought to be OCR-0001 etc

  http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-common-numbering/2013-May/000005.html

I am in the process of cross-referencing these to ASVS, OT10 and
CAPEC, and was going to do it to the Testing Guide v3 codes. I was
also going to think how we can add relationships like "more specific
than" like a thesaurus so that the order and level of detail does not
matter. The XML format doesn't matter at the moment, it can be
altered, but it is then transformable into other layouts.

I have found my discussion document (attached) from March 2011 i.e.
the testing guide can use whatever structure and numbering it wants,
and externalise the cross-referencing (e.g. to the SCPQRG). If anyone
doesn't receive the PDF, email me directly.
