Hi, all!

Do you plan to move to ReStructuredText/Sphinx/GitHub/readthedocs.org as 
documentation publishing platform?  It also supports PDF generation 
(https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features.html)

> As a rich and diverse security community we should be proud of the

> or reviewed the Guide.
> You'll notice several changes between v3 and v4. Some sections have been

> improves on
> version 3 in three ways:
> 
> *1.* This version of the Testing Guide integrates with the two other
> flagship OWASP documentation products: the Developers Guide and the Code
> Review Guide. To achieve this we aligned the testing categories and test
> numbering with those in other OWASP products. The objective of the Testing
> and Code Review Guides is to evaluate the security controls described by
> the Developers Guide.
> 
> *2.* All chapters have been improved and test cases expanded to 87 (64 test
> cases in v3) including the introduction of four new chapters and controls:
> - Identity Management Testing
> - Error Handling
> - Cryptography
> - Client Side Testing
> 
> *3.* This version of the Testing Guide encourages the community not to
> simply accept the test cases outlined in this guide. We encourage security
> testers to integrate with other software testers and devise test cases
> specific to the target application. As we find test cases that have wider
> applicability we encourage the security testing community to share them and
> contribute them to the Testing Guide. This will continue to build the
> application security body of knowledge and allow the development of the
> Testing Guide to be an iterative rather than monolithic process.
> 
> 
> As we continue to improve our tools and documentation, we'd like to ask you
> to support OWASP to reach the following goals:
> 
>   *Continuously improve the guide*.
> The Guide is a "live" document: we always need your feedback! Tell us what
> you love. Tell us what you love less.
> Please join our testing mailing list and share your ideas:
> http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing
> 
>   *Promote the Testing Guide*.
> We would like to have some more media coverage on the Guide, so please, if
> you know somebody that can help please put them in touch with us.
> If you have the chance, you can write an article about the Testing Guide
> and other new OWASP Projects.
> 
>   *Add 'quotes' to the Guide*.
> We made a special 'quotes' pages for the Testing Guide.
> Here we'd link you to add comments and references to the Guide.

> 
> The OWASP Testing Guide includes a "best practice" penetration testing
> framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a "low
> level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for testing most
> common web application and web service security issues.
