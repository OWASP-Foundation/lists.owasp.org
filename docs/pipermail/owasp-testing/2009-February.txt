Subject: [Owasp-testing] How to propose changes to the testing guide?
Message-ID: <13e5eed0902120120x6a95af7fq7efcc400af0882db@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm new to this list, but not to the testing guide. After the presentation
of Matteo at FOSDEM last Sunday, I decided I wanted to participate in the
Testing Guide Project.
In the past I've read through version 2 of the guide and noted that still
some small typing errors slipped into the published version. I also noted
that some of these errors are still there in version 3.
For example in OWASP-CM-002 (DB Listener), in the Black Box Testing after
mentioning some default users, you can read: 'In this case, we have not
founded privileged DBA accounts...' which could be replaced with 'In this
case, we didn't find privileged DBA accounts...'

I plan on reading through version 3 of the Testing Guide within the coming
weeks and I was wondering what is the process of submitting changes to the
guide.

   - Do you send these typo's in emails to the mailing list or to some
   individuals?
   - Do you send the Word version with track changes to the mailing list or
   to some individuals?
   - Do you directly change on the Wiki?
   - ...


Kind regards,

Lode --

Hi Lode,
thank you for your email and excuse me for the late.

Yes, we adopted the wiki model so you can add and edit the paragraph
template simply creating an user on owasp.org. Every project leader
monitors all the changing and verify if the edit is good or not for
the project.

BTW, we just finished the project of version 3 and we are waiting to
create a new project for version 4, also if the main goal now is to
integrate better the Dev, Code Review, Testing and ASDR projects.

Here is the book of the Testing Guide v3 just released:

Thanks!
Mat

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Additions to "4.2 Information gathering"
Message-ID: <13e5eed0902160849o267006edn8dc8336783ce878b@mail.gmail.com>

All,

While reading through chapter 4.2 on Information Gathering, I found some
opportunities where we could add some more tools to the testing phase for
section "4.2.5 Application Discovery"

In the "Approaches to address issue 1 - non-standard URLs" section, we could
make reference to applications like OWASP's DirBuster and Nikto which can be
used to try to find "hidden urls".
In the "Approaches to address issue 3 - virtual hosts" section, we could
make reference to a tool like 'dnsenum' which tries to brute force
subdomains. Comparing the resolved IP addresses of found subdomains might
give you some more Virtual Hosts.

I'm pretty sure we can add the references to DirBuster and Nikto, so I'll
update the text on the wiki.
However, I'm not so sure we could add dnsenum, since there we would be
querying the DNS server and not the webserver.

What's your opinion about this?

Regards,

Lode
