Yeah I understand the problem with endorsing commercial tools, but I  
think linking to a third party list of tools is maybe going too far.   
How about a simple set of rules:
- If the tool is commercial, then the only thing that the guide can  
state is the name of the tool and a link to the vendor's site.   
Nothing else.
- The above rule can be stated just above the Commercial Tools list  
together with: &quot;These products are in no way endorsed by OWASP and are  
listed here only for the reader's convenience&quot; - or something like that.
- If it's open source, then we can go on to comment on what it's good  
points are and its bad points etc.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I would also appreciate existence of some vendor-unbiased, open  
</I>&gt;<i> project
</I>&gt;<i> that would compare various commercial/free penetration tools,  
</I>&gt;<i> scanners, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Because at the present time (when sometimes it is impossible to  
</I>&gt;<i> obtain from
</I>&gt;<i> vendor free/trial version) it is very difficult to compare various  
</I>&gt;<i> penetration
</I>&gt;<i> tools and decide which is better in which category
</I>
Absolutely!    are you volunteering? ;)
