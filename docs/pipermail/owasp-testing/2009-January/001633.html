<PRE>I agree with Pavol.

This is more a political issue, involve the board just to make sure. About benchmarking, Vendors are very reluctant to them , even EULAs contain clauses that prohibit you to benchmark some products.

I remember Tom Brennan just posted a site for people to upload independent evaluation of tool, maybe those posted there could be used in the guide as they are offered to but not done by OWASP.

:<i>) I will cut the discussion from my side as I have spend a lot of your time applying gas to the topic :)

Personally, I don't mind it. 
But this (mentioning commercial tools in the testing guide) is more OWASP political issue (I would be interested in the opinion of OWASP board :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> And I would also appreciate existence of some vendor-unbiased, open

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scanners, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because at the present time (when sometimes it is impossible to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely!    are you volunteering? ;)
</I>
Why not? I really like testing new stuff:-)

But if this &quot;testing tool comparison/benchmark project&quot; should be vendor/product unbiased, it should be covered by some unbiased open foundation.
And I am afraid the OWASP organization will not cover this project, because OWASP does not endorse commercial products or services (which is case of our comparison testing tool project, or am I wrong?)
