<PRE>Hi,

Uff, how can a vendor prohibit you to benchmark/compare his product with the
competitive one? I think, this is a basic right of all customers in all 
democratic societies - to benchmark/compare various products and write about 
them.

I think this is very similar to &quot;comparative advertising&quot; which is allowed
in the US also in the EU :

<A HREF="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:376:0021:0027:EN:PDF">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:376:0021:0027:EN:PDF</A>

Can you show me at least one EULAs (of security tool) where it is prohibited
to benchmark it?

And what we can do - if some vendors of security tools prohibit us to benchmark
their tools - we will not involve their tools in our benchmark/comparison, 
we will just mention that due to the vendor NDA we can't benchmark them.
And this act can be very negative for their product promotion -&gt; 
personally I would never buy a product that can't be compared with the other 
one..

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I remember Tom Brennan just posted a site for people to upload independent evaluation of tool, maybe those posted there could be used in the guide as they are offered to but not done by OWASP.

Can you send us URL?
