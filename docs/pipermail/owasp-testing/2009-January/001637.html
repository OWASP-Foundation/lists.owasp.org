<PRE>At this moment I am doing a small comparison between several vulnerability
scanners in our testenvironment and I can tell you from first hand
experience that at least IBM, HP and Acunetix have no problem providing
licenses for testing purposes or publication of the test results .
In fact when I presented my test plan they were quite eager to participate !
Off course 3 companies cannot speak for an entire industry, but I think that
it is a signal that things have changed ...

Regarding the testing of tools I see some problems. First of all the test
objects; Webgoat could be a start, but how will you test scanners
specialised in e.g. php or oracle ? Creating test environments for all
possible combinations of OS, DB, webserver and application server is
possible off course, but will take huge amounts of time, storage and (if you
make them available to the community) bandwidth....

Furthermore there is the test methodology; if you let the community do the
tests you need some form of quality control to make sure the test is done
properly and the results are unbiased. The last thing you want is creating
an opportunity for influencing the results ....

&gt;<i> I agree, as long a deep research of tools is done and all of them are
</I>&gt;<i> published that is ok,  while we not only mention those we know at first
</I>&gt;<i> hand (Which I think is huge effort) also adding an invitation in the
</I>&gt;<i> guide page asking readers to add more tools is a good idea, I guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About comparison is not that you cannot compare them, of course you can
</I>&gt;<i> do it, for internal purposes. But in our experience and AFAIK. What you
</I>&gt;<i> cannot do, is to publish the results of the comparison without
</I>&gt;<i> permission of the vendor, that (ironically) is the purpose of the
</I>&gt;<i> comparison in our case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my experience in the past, but, it was before acquisition of
</I>&gt;<i> SPIDynamics and Watchfire so maybe the policies have changed by now.
</I>&gt;<i> Also this might not be applicable to all the vendors, anyway, if they
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be benchmarking a not of &quot;Not possible to benchmark&quot; or similar
</I>&gt;<i> might work and maybe self-promote a benchmark for one of those tools.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    I suggest that we should follow the same rule that is in force for
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    meetings.  The basic principle is that you can't use OWASP to
</I>&gt;<i> promote your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    product (outside of an authorized commercial opportunity - like an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    advertisement, conference sponsorship, etc...)  Mentions of vendor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    products are allowed on the website, but only in the context of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    particular problem, and only when a broad survey of the available
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    commercial and open-source tools is performed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds absolutely logical for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what about a new vendor-unbiased, open OWASP project that would
</I>&gt;<i> compare various commercial and free penetration tools, scanners (all
</I>&gt;<i> high-quality stuff we daily use :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because at the present time (when sometimes it is impossible to obtain
</I>&gt;<i> from vendor free/trial version) it is very difficult to compare various
</I>&gt;<i> penetration tools and decide which is better in which category....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And because almost all available (opensource + commercial) used tools
</I>&gt;<i> would be mentioned in this project, this project should be
</I>&gt;<i> vendor-unbiased.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can benchmark these tools against OWASP WebGoat (or create some other
</I>&gt;<i> test samples).
</I>&gt;<i> And of course - if this &quot;testing tool comparison/benchmark project&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> should be vendor/product unbiased, it should be covered by some unbiased
</I>&gt;<i> open foundation
</I>&gt;<i> (OWASP?) not by a private company.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Juan Carlos also mentioned than vendors are very reluctant to
</I>&gt;<i> benchmarking (some EULAs can contain clauses that prohibit you to
</I>&gt;<i> benchmark some products).
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I don't know any &quot;non-comparable&quot; security tool, but if they
</I>&gt;<i> really exist, we simply would not involve these tools in the final
</I>&gt;<i> benchmark/comparison (personally I would never buy a product that could
</I>&gt;<i> not be compared with the other one :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remember, our original OWASP mission is &quot;to have more secure web
</I>&gt;<i> applications in the world&quot;, so we can use this &quot;open benchmark project&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to support/promote _ALL_ high-quality tools (and in this case it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> matter if they are commercial or not).
</I>&gt;<i> I think that everybody would appreciate this project :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ? Is it compliant with OWASP rules?
