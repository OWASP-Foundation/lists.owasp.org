As Juan Carlos has already mentioned, promotion of commercial tools by 
the testing guide can be classified as a kind of endorsement (who can without 
bias decide which commercial tool is better than the other one? :-) 
On the other hand, there are some really great commercial tools worthwhile 
to mention, e.g. I am really excited with BurpSuite Professional with autoscan
functionality (I have nothing with Burpsuite, I am just satisfied customer :-)
I like Juan Carlos idea, that the guide should have links to sites that by
themselves should list commercial tools.

And I would also appreciate existence of some vendor-unbiased, open project 
that would compare various commercial/free penetration tools, scanners, etc.
Because at the present time (when sometimes it is impossible to obtain from 
vendor free/trial version) it is very difficult to compare various penetration 
tools and decide which is better in which category... (btw. do you know which
commercial/opensource scanner is the best one in seeking persistent/dom-based 
XSS? I don't... :-)
And because our original OWASP mission is &quot;to have more secure web 
applications in the world&quot;, we should support/promote _ALL_ high-quality tools 
(doesn't matter if they are commercial or opensource).

Pavol Luptak
