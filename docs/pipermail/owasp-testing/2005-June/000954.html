<PRE>Morning all,

Sorry for the short break in the testing guide progress, the real  
world caught up with me.
Attached are the documents needed for the next part of the guide, and  
they are:

Testing Guide II Structure.doc

This is the final TOC as we agreed and next to each section, there is  
the option to add your name and your e-mail address(i.e you will be  
writing this section)

template1.htm

If you could structure all your submissions using this template (you  
can use any format you like, word/text/xml, as long as i can read it  
on a mac!)

Guidelines for creating sections:

- DO NOT DO A STRAIGHT COPY FROM ANY OTHER SOURCES ON THE WEB!
Plagiarism won't be accepted.
This testing guide should reflect the experience you all have in  
application testing. One of the benefits of OWASP is that the wealth  
of experience from the contributors enables the reader to understand  
the section they are reading, as it is presented in a well structured  
format, which unlike a large amount of research papers on the web  
today, isn't normally the case.

- Try and use examples where possible and also let other &quot;non- 
security&quot; individuals read what you have written. This ensures that  
it makes sense to everyone and not just the hardcore penetration  
testers out there.

- I understand everyone has a life and work commitments, so please  
don't select loads of sections if you know you may not be able to  
commit to them in the end run.

- Contact me if you have any issues during this next phase


I think we should aim to have all the sections written by mid August,  
how does this sound for everyone?

Obviously if you feel there is a section missing from the TOC, by all  
means contact me

Look forward to seeing the work coming in

Daniel Cuthbert
