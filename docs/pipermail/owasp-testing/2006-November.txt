web view cvs sometimes take a while to update. It is there now and you
are signed up sir ! Thanks.
 
I have also taken transport security. I have a pretty good technique
using OpenSSL to test SSL algorithms, available key lengths and
certificates validity and properties.

Mark,
 
    I didn't see any files on sourceforge.net under the testing project,
though I may not have been in the correct place. If no one has signed up
for 'Parameter Manipulation', please mark me down for it.
 
Thanks,
Jim

	OK folks, in the CVS under a module called testing are two
files. One is a
	sign-up list to write up how to test specific issues and the
other a very
	basic HTML template. 
	
	If you are interested in participating please let Penny Major or
myself know
	what you would like to write up and we will update the list.
First come
	first served. As always copyright will be FSF and released under
GPL. If you
	haven't signed up to write up anything by  Sunday we are going
to cull this
	list as it is for active participants and this project is now
officially
	active ;-) All write-ups should be complete within a month and
be no more
	than 2,500 words. Penny and I will then piece this together with
the into
	etc and create a first draft. Please ensure the how to test is
not just
	black box testing. If you aren't sure about code analysis or
other ways to
	test, mail the list and ask for help.
	
	If you can't or don't do CVS the files are attached.
	
	Lets go !

<H2>Date 17th November<BR></H2>
<H2>Author Javier Fern=E1ndez-Sanguino<BR></H2>
<H1>Short Description of Issue</H1>
<P>Cross Site Scripting attacks (XSS) are attempts to subvert the =
relationship=20
between a user's browser and a trusted site in order to retrieve =
sensitive=20
information from the user's browser. Attackers can exploit this attack =
due to=20
flaws in the web server code (such as the way error request are shown) =
or in the=20
way it stores information that is later on presented to user (comments =
to news,=20
forums, web-based e-mail readers, etc.). If the information is not =
sanitized=20
before it is stored or&nbsp; if it is not santized when introduced into =
an HTML=20
object, it might lead to code execution in the users's browser, this =
code is=20
executed as in the context of the trusted site. Execution of code, =
including=20
Javascript, VisualBasic Script,&nbsp; ActiveX, or Java applets can be =
used for a=20
different purposes (including arbitrary remote code execution in =
vulnerable or=20
misconfigured browsers), but a Cross Site Scripting has as its main =
purpose the=20
retrieval of session information that involves the remote site. This =
session=20
information (usually in the form of cookies) can then be used to hijack =
the=20
user's session (before it expires) if the remote site does not control =
where the=20
session was established form.</P>
<P>XSS attacks can be produced both by sending crafted URLs to potential =
targets=20
through e-mail or by storing them in web-pages and hiding them as =
legitimate=20
links, images, or other type of information. Common sources of these =
kind of=20
attacks are webmail applications and web-based bulletin boards, but in =
some=20
cases even web servers are directly affected.<BR></P>
<H1>How to Test</H1>
<P>Testing the success of XSS attempts involves determining where does =
the web=20
application introduce information generated by an attacker into an HTML =
response=20
which might be viewed by a user (and interpreted by his browser). =
Usually,=20
determining that JavaScript will be run is enough to demonstrate that an =
XSS=20
attack is possible. Although whether or not this kind of attack can =
succeed=20
depends on if this attack can be introduced permanently into the web =
server (for=20
example through a comment posted in the web site) or needs to be done =
through=20
social engineering attacks (like e-mail).<BR></P>
<H2>Black Box</H2>
<P>In order to do black box testing of XSS the tester first needs to =
determine=20
which parts of the web server application introduces information =
generated by an=20
attacker. This can include either dynamically generated HTML pages based =
on POST=20
or GET calls to applications (including error pages they generate which =
include=20
said content) or content generated based on information stored in the =
website=20
that is later on presented to legitimate users. Once these places have =
been=20
determined the tester should try to inject code and see if it is =
included=20
verbatim in the HTML page returned and whether it is filtered or not. If =

filtered, the tester needs to make sure that all potential sources for =
XSS=20
attacks are appropiately filtered.<BR></P>
<P>Notice that it is also necessary to determine if it is possible to do =
session=20
replays (using retrieved cookies) from sources different from the one =
that=20
started the session. Session hijacking might be hindered and even if XSS =
attacks=20
are possible, their impact might be limited.<BR></P>
<P></P>
<H2>White Box <BR></H2>
<P>Source code analysis must be focused on how the application manages=20
information that is presented to the end user or stored to later =
generate HTML=20
pages . Any such information must be sanitized before storage and must =
be also=20
santized before it is given to the user; this includes filtering all =
HTML tags.=20
If HTML tags are allowed in the content, the reviewer must make sure =
that the=20
filter implement to sanitize these tags only allows tags (and =

Message-ID: <mailman.10.1162406173.13353.owasp-testing@lists.owasp.org>

testing, regression, configuration and safe defaults are not mentioned, and
should be. 

 

The pen test chapter disagrees with the other chapters on the value of pen
tests. I have my own view (it's a useful check once the app is nearly
ready), but this testing project must be internally consistent for a
consensus view. What is people's view? 

 

Other than that, I'm sure this guide will be useful to many. To those who
wrote this material, good work :-)

code published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and
can
be shared and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is
FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good
inevitable
practicality (since if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM
would not exist). <br>
<br>
Starting to <b>complain that 1) most Owasp members are 'takers'
instead of
'givers' and 2) they are only interested in getting from Owasp things
for FREE (as in
beer, i.e. no cost) , is in my view: </b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>offensive </b>to those Owasp members (who I include myself
in) since they are
being called: thieves, opportunistic and selfish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>short-sighted</b>, since there is much more than meets the
eye (things are never black or white)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>counter-productive</b>, since it is creating unnecessary
frictions and
bad feelings amongst the community, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Missing the point</b>, since the main discussion point should
be always about FREEDOM
and not about COST<br>
<br>
Going further, from my point of view, <b>blaming the current lack of
participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of the current Owasp
community</b> (which are being labeled as 'takers' and not 'givers')<b>
is
merely a scapegoat exercise which fails to address the core problems
and
doesn't allows for the real issue to be dealt with.</b><br>
<br>
In my view, <b>it is not the responsibility and duty of the current
Owasp
members</b> (for example the persons subscribed to the current mailing
lists) <b>to be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of
time to those projects.</b><br>
<br>
In my view, <b>IT IS THE SPECIFIC OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS THE
RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT where those project's
members
</b>(and the other Owasp leaders)<b> fell motivated to participate and
become active members</b>. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of
work,
dedication and patience by those project leaders. <br>
<br>
This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - make everybody aware of what is going on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which can be
executed by the community (it should be possible for somebody that
wants to contribute to be able to go to a web page and be given a task
which will not take him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare
that to the current situation))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - actively market the Owasp project and encourage participation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - manage expectations and ensure that the project's members are
motivated and happy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ensure that all contributions are respectively credited and that
people are rewarded for their time and commitment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create products based on that Project's deliverables (white
papers, tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by Owasp<br>
<br>
Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project
manager experience, I
believe that I have
earned the right to make these grand statements, specially since&nbsp;<b> I
consider
that I</b> (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp leader of the Owasp-dotNet
projects)
<b>am a very BAD LEADER because I was not able to make the current 130
Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in the current Owasp-dotNet
projects</b> (I am including myself in the guilty-list). I have also
been
very bad at replying to contributors (sorry
specially to Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module))
and should
have done much more to help those subscribers to understand how the
tools that I have developed and published work and how they can
contribute.<br>
<br>
One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate
and 'come to life' (and <b>I don't blame them for not participating, I
blame myself</b>)<br>
<br>
<b>
What Owasp needs now are strong, creative and active leaders who will
have to continuously prove </b>(i.e. every week, every month, every
year)
<b>that they deserve to be Owasp Leaders and that they can be
responsible
for his/hers projects.</b><br>
<br>
In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must
guarantee and fight for <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join and be (if
desired) a non-contributor member)<br>
<br>
, is because <b>when Leaders stop behaving accordingly to his/hers
responsibilities</b> (for personal or professional reasons) <b>his/hers
replacement </b>(amicably or not) <b>must be an relatively easy and
strait-forward process </b>(following the wishes of that project's
community). <br>
<br>
As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an <b>Owasp Leader can only
be
an Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and recognizes his/hers
leadership</b> (see the Linus example). <br>
<br>
In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where
the focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as
possible) in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.<br>
<br>
<b>B) My comments on .... Jeff as a OWASP leader</b><br>
<br>
Before I go any further let me just say that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in Owasp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the creation of the
Owasp Foundation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous when he accepted
(from Mark)
the role as the main Owasp Leader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff should continue to have some management roles
in Owasp <br>
<br>
But <b>I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN Owasp
Leader,</b>
since I don't think that Jeff has (based on his actions so far) what I
would consider to be the right profile to be the main leader that Owasp
needs today<br>
<br>
Although <b>Jeff is beyond doubt a very active and productive Owasp
member </b>(whose technical competence and professionalism is of the
highest caliber)<b> I don't think that Jeff</b> (to which I sincerely
apologize for such a public criticism)<b> has the energy, vision and
'craziness'
required to lead a project like Owasp (as it is today)</b>. Maybe it is
Jeff's training as a
Lawyer that makes him risk-adverse, maybe it is just his personally,
and maybe it is just the current phase that Owasp is currently in
(<b>there is no reason why Jeff's profile is not the most indicated to
lead Owasp in one, two or ten years time</b>).<br>
<br>
<b>
What Owasp needs now is to have an energetic, dynamic, thought
provoking
and inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into a being major player in
the Web Application Security World,</b> and help it to make the world
a 'safer' (and better) place.<br>
<br>
From&nbsp; my point of view,&nbsp; <b>unless Mark retakes the Job</b> (which is
not an option at the
current moment in time), <b>I think that Owasp should </b>( in the
short term)
<b>NOT HAVE A MAIN LEADER! </b><br>
<br>
In the short term, <b>Owasp should only have operational-leaders</b>
(or whatever they would be
called) <b>responsible for specific operational tasks </b>(for
example dealing
with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the Owasp servers,
the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business
development exercises, etc...).<br>
<br>
Hopefully the <b>crisis created by Mark's departure will create an
environment where the new future Owasp Leader will appear, </b>and
his/her
promotion to Owasp leadership is accepted/proposed by the majority of
Owasp
Leaders and Members.<br>
<br>
<b><br>
</b><b>C) My comments on </b><b>... </b><b>the industry current COLD
reaction to OWASP<br>
<br>
</b>Another factor which in my view is not helping the development of
Owasp is the fact that <b>Owasp is trying to do something that the
security industry doesn't
want to happen</b>. For example: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web Application
Security,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the Development of Open Source security tools, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - and ultimately addressing the real problems that are creating the
current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'<br>
<br>
Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too
much money with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE
efforts
in
actually solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill
their
markets). <br>
<br>
<b>
The reality is that the ones that have most to benefit from Owasp, are
the current 'Security
products/services buyers' </b>because these are the ones that are
currently
buying
overpriced and incomplete products/solutions. <b>The problem is that
these
'entities'</b> (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs, persons) <b>need
to
have something to buy</b> (which OWASP currently doesn't have) <b>and
are used
to</b> (and demand/expect) <b>a credible, professional and reliable
service</b>.<br>
<br>
In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the
Security Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft
downwards) and should focus on these entities (companies, governments,
persons, etc...) which have most to benefit from Owasp work.<br>
<br>
<b>The current Owasp successes</b> (like the wide spread usage of the
Top 10) <b>must
be built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and
perceived independence is one of Owasp biggest assets</b><br>
<br>
<b><br>
D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'</b><br>
<br>
I also find fascinating the fact that <b>the current Owasp-dotNet
leader</b>
(i.e. me)<b> has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft
Asp.Net
team regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published</b>:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting
Environment (SAM'SHE)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Reflector<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Online Metabase explorer<br>
<br>
<b>
The only logic explanation </b>that I have for this situation (since
these
tools DO actually work and have helped hundreds of companies to improve
their Asp.Net hosting environments) <b>is that Microsoft doesn't want
to
'endorse' these tools because all of them show how insecure and
dangerous
the current Full Trust Asp.Net environment is</b>.<br>
<br>
Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the
industry, since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously
from
a vibrant development community continuously developing and improving
these tools. The reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is
important,&nbsp; is because Microsoft is currently one of the most active
and responsive companies to security issues and&nbsp; shows how low the
current level is :-(. <br>
<br>
For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) think that
they are
not doing enough, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) say that they are making a massive mistake with
their current lack of acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust
Asp.Net
Vulnerabilities;<br>
<br>
, based on my professional experience, I still think that
<b>Microsoft DOES TAKE Security much more Seriously than most other
Software
companies out there</b>
(which again shows how we are still very far away from starting to
tackle the real security problems and vulnerabilities that exist in
today's Web Applications).<br>
<b><br>
</b><b>E) My comments on </b><b>...</b><b> making Money with Owasp<br>
<br>
</b>Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a
crazy-open-source-guy which lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to
state, that I fully understand that Money and Financial reward is a
major element in our current society and way of live. I am not
anti-corporations, anti-capitalism or anti-making money.<br>
<br>
We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you
manage to get paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e.
not charge for it)<br>
<br>
I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that
position where most projects that I worked where projects that I would
gladly do for free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very
relevant to Owasp, is the fact that a <b>substantial percentage of my
income for the past 6 months originated in projects directly related to
my participation and contributions to Owasp</b>.<br>
<br>
Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that
I received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is:
<b>Thank you Owasp</b><br>
<br>
In some ways I am a good success-story of how <b>Owasp can directly
and
indirectly provide a good financial and professional reward to active
and participative members.</b><br>
<br>
I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in
certain areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), <b>Owasp
has
the opportunity to become a 'recruitment center' for high-skilled,
reliable and effective developers</b> (since all that the employers
would
need to do is to look at the prospective employee participation and
contribution record)<b><br>
</b><br>
<b>F) My comments on ... the fact that most Owasp projects have no
participation from the community<br>
<br>
</b>In my view there are several <b>reasons why most Owasp Projects
don't
have more than 2 to 5 active participants</b>:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) <b>lack of time: </b>Most good and knowledgeable members are
currently very busy and have very little time to dedicate to personal
projects<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) <b>the current '2h to start being productive' </b><b>paradigm</b>:
which means
that if I (for example) want to participate in a project, I will need
to dedicate at least 2 hours to the project in order to start being
productive (sometimes even for simple things like adding content to the
new website!). <b>What we need is the</b> <b>'30m to start being
productive</b><b>' </b><b>paradigm</b><b>
</b>or even better the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which
when functional, actually create an environment where participants
regularly spend 2 hours or more on the project). Let me give a musical
analogy (for the ones that don't know, I am also a part-time
professional drummer): If you want to practice a music instrument on a
regular basis (for example every day), you must create an environment
where there is there is almost no effort required to start practicing
(i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be able to start
practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). This
means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always
be set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow
for spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most
productive) when the musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m -
15m' (which usually gets 'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This
creates an environment where it is easy to practice and in the
musician's mind, practicing is not associated with spending 30m to
set-up the practice environment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) <b>Most Owasp projects don't have clear 'this is want you can
do to participate' instructions</b> and require quite a lot of work and
effort by the would-be contributors and participants<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) <b>Owasp memberships is not big enough </b>where there are
enough people with an 'itch' (i.e. problem or requirement) similar to
the project leader's 'itch', which will make them go one step further
and spend the time, effort and dedication required to become an active
participant and member<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) <b>Most projects are very dependent on the availability and
energy-level of the project leader</b> (which usually is also its
author / creator). Hopefully we will soon reach a critical mass point
(the 10,000 member mark?) where the community surrounding a project is
vibrant enough to compensate for the regular MIA (Missing in Action)
periods<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) and probably the most important one. <b>Collaborating in an
Open
Source project is VERY HARD</b>. Sometime I fell an urge to hit
persons who make FUD claims such as 'Open Source projects are created
by a network of Kids and clueless programmers' (note that I am a
non-violent person and very rarely get angry). Sending a comment like
"humm, i clicked on this button and the application crashed" is very
easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment like "I installed the
application and I had a problem with XYZ function which I traced back
to the method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it which solved the
problem" or "I've read this 50 page document and here are my comments"
is :<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code or words)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR
SUBJECT MATTER<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in effect sending a
criticism of someone else's work)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. "...I think that
this is a better way to do it...") which is always a hard thing to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that project's leader)
PAST BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS <br>
<br>
So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of
contributions of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully
Open Source projects have as their main contributors highly
intelligent,
competent, dedicated and creative IT Professionals. <br>
<br>
<b><br>
</b><b>G) My comments on </b><b>... Why I haven't participate on other
Owasp Projects<br>
<br>
</b>Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first person
and say that<b> I am as guilty of anybody else for not participating in
other Owasp projects. <br>
</b>
<br>
I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat,
WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide,
since I have used them professionally.<br>
<br>
And the <b>reasons that I have for not participating are:</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; <b>I didn't have</b> the required <b>time </b>to put myself
in a position where
I was able to send meaningful contributions <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Those<b> project leaders didn't put any pressure on me to
participate and didn't actively encourage it</b> (when one is working
on
several projects at the same time, unfortunately the projects that
don't make any noise
and are not critical tend to live permanently on the
'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours'
pile)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There is almost <b>no documentation to help</b>&nbsp; (although I do
admit that I didn't make a huge effort to find it)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I <b>didn't need professionally an improved version of those
tools/documents</b> (i.e. I didn't had the 'itch' that those projects
are
scratching)<br>
<br>
<b>
To start contributing in these projects I needed to be given simple,
quick and meaningful</b> (i.e. could
be used in the actual project) <b>tasks </b>(the '30m task' paradigm)
and I
have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I should participate. <br>
<br>
I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must
subconsciously
feel that my efforts will be appreciated.<br>
<br>
I am assuming that If motivated and focused I&nbsp; would produce material
of high quality and that the project leader would find valuable
(although anybody should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp
leader has no duty to spend any time motivating and nurturing people
who don't have the appropriate skills, knowledge, attitude or
commitment)<br>
<br>
And this is the bottom line:<b> it is the leaders of these projects </b>(WebGoat,
WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test list)<b>
that have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to participate</b>,
and if they don't want to do
it (since that is hard and takes time), then they should <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) step down (from leaders), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) become 'normal' project members, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) continue to submit their contributions&nbsp; and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another Owasp member that
is willing to do it.<br>
<br>
Now, <b>does my lack of participation on these projects make me a
'taker'!
</b>Somebody that is 'exploiting' the work of the talented and
dedicated
persons who worked on this projects? <b>Do I deserve</b> (due to my
lack of
participation) <b>to be kicked out of the current mailing lists and
not be
member of those projects?<br>
</b>
<b><br>
</b><b>H) My comments on </b><b>... </b><b>Mark's influence on Owasp<br>
<br>
</b>I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in OWASP
today. <br>
<br>
It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open
Source) that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and
lead the Owasp-dotNet efforts.<br>
<br>
Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the
same ideals and it is always very refreshing when one meets other
like-minded individuals.<br>
<br>
Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to
help Owasp in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and
partly responsible for his decision. <b>The main reason I am writing
this 'Open Letter to Owasp'
is so that Mark's departure is not in vain and Owasp is able to learn
from its mistakes and change the current environment which caused one
of Owasp most important members to quit.</b><br>
<br>
Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must
have been for him to take this decision. <br>
<br>
<b>
I hope that this 'Open Letter to Owasp' kick-starts a healthy
discussion and is well received by the other Owasp Leaders and Members.
</b><br>
<br>
Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I
am out of order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense,
please do let me know. <br>
<br>
I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals
are not welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart)
also quit and find (or create) another Community<br>
<br>
<b>I) My comments on </b><b>...</b><b>how Owasp can make money:<br>
<br>
</b>Just before I get into practical solutions (because one cannot only
talk, one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where
Owasp can make money:<b><br>
<br>
</b>&nbsp;- Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Consultancy <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Accreditations <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Official Curriculum<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Books and White papers<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Conferences<br>
<b><br>
And what could this money be used for? <br>
<br>
In my view it should be
used to pay for:</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Owasp Administrative services <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) Owasp Projects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Creation of Documentation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Packaging of Owasp Products <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Marketing and PR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sales<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Support to Owasp's product or services <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>J) Ideas for the Future:<br>
<br>
</b>Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point Owasp in
the right direction:<b><br>
<br>
</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>In the short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader</b>,
since this position
(which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be earned not
given. This means that the next Owasp's leader
should be chosen by Owasp's Leaders with full support by Owasp's
community<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Jeff should continue to have several responsibilities within
Owasp
management</b>, but current Owasp leaders should be able to say "I
would
like to take responsibility for 'XYZ' task" <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>The current Owasp leaders should do what I recommended
earlier
and actively encourage their communities to participate in their
project.</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>The current Owasp leaders should also make an effort to
participate in each others projects.</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>A series of 30m tasks should be defined for each project,
which
will allow the Owasp members to easily contribute and participate</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>On the short term, Owasp must have a CMS </b>(Content
Management
System) <b>solution
which allows authorized members to QUICKLY (in minutes) and EASILY (not
too many clicks) add content to the LIVE SERVER Hosting the main Owasp
and individual project's websites.</b> I don't care if this
is done with <span>the current Magnolia solution, with b-sec's CMS
(support.binaryvision.com.au), </span>a
very Expensive donated CMS (<a href="http://www.tomoye.com">www.tomoye.com</a>),
with FrontPage, with
Dreamweaver or with NOTEPAD!!!! <b>What I want is something that
doesn't
get in the way, and I can get my content uploaded and published to
Owasp website in 10m</b>. And (please don't kill me for this), in the
beginning I don't
really care about how secure this system is. The
first objective is to create a dynamic, vibrant and very active
community. If we get maliciously hacked, then so be it!!!&nbsp; Note that I
am not
saying that Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a
template) a secure hosting environment. Just to avoid confusions let me
say it again: <b>"I do
think that Owasp should host its online content in an locked down
environment which is as secure as possible".</b> What I trying to say
is
that
the current priority should be in creating vibrant communities (which
could, as
one of
its projects build a tool to create and configure secure hosting
environments)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>- There must be total clarity of Owasp finances and financial
operations</b>. The current lack of transparency is not healthy and
doesn't
promote contributions. I know that there are some short-term
credibility issues with the current low-turnover but I strongly believe
that the advantages of full openness are far bigger than the
disadvantages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Once the current Owasp finances are published, <b>a short term
investment plan should be created which defines what Owasp wants to do,
how much money it requires, and where is that money going to come from</b>
(for example I can (through my UK company) make some financial
contributions to OWASP)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>A series of 'Owasp Products' should be created</b> (based on
the
current
Owasp projects)<b> and sold online</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Owasp should take a much more aggressive position in the
Industry
and start making its Voice heard. </b>And if this creates controversy,
then
so be it (the open letter sent last month was a good start). From my
point of view, the moment Owasp starts to be attacked
by 'respected' security companies and organizations, is the moment that
Owasp is starting to do its job right and is starting to change the
world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>A formal Owasp Leader recognition process should be created
which
publicly recognizes current Owasp Leaders</b> <b>and most active
Project
contributors</b> (since this will help those person's careers and will
encourage others to become leaders them selfs)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>A formal 'Thank you' letter should be sent to Mark</b>
(signed by as
many members as possible) as a gesture of gratitude for what he has
done
for Owasp<br>
<br>
<b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A meeting should take place to discuss this (and other) ideas</b><br>
<b><br>
</b>I hope that this made sense and if you made it this far, thanks for
your patience for reading this long, rambling and of my entire
responsibility 'Open Letter to Owasp'<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to your comments<br>
<br>
Best regards<br>

published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and can be
shared and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is FREE (as
in beer, i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good inevitable
practicality (since if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM would
not exist). 

Starting to complain that 1) most Owasp members are 'takers' instead of
'givers' and 2) they are only interested in getting from Owasp things for
FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in my view: 

    - offensive to those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they
are being called: thieves, opportunistic and selfish
    - short-sighted, since there is much more than meets the eye (things are
never black or white)
    - counter-productive, since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad
feelings amongst the community, and 
    - Missing the point, since the main discussion point should be always
about FREEDOM and not about COST

Going further, from my point of view, blaming the current lack of
participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of the current Owasp
community (which are being labeled as 'takers' and not 'givers') is merely a
scapegoat exercise which fails to address the core problems and doesn't
allows for the real issue to be dealt with.

In my view, it is not the responsibility and duty of the current Owasp
members (for example the persons subscribed to the current mailing lists) to
be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of time to those
projects.

In my view, IT IS THE SPECIFIC OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS THE
RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT where those project's
members (and the other Owasp leaders) fell motivated to participate and
become active members. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work,
dedication and patience by those project leaders. 

This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: 

    - make everybody aware of what is going on
    - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which can be executed by
the community (it should be possible for somebody that wants to contribute
to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which will not take
him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the current
situation))
    - actively market the Owasp project and encourage participation
    - manage expectations and ensure that the project's members are
motivated and happy
    - ensure that all contributions are respectively credited and that
people are rewarded for their time and commitment
    - create products based on that Project's deliverables (white papers,
tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by Owasp

Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project manager
experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand
statements, specially since  I consider that I (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp
leader of the Owasp-dotNet projects) am a very BAD LEADER because I was not
able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in the
current Owasp-dotNet projects (I am including myself in the guilty-list). I
have also been very bad at replying to contributors (sorry specially to
Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) and should have
done much more to help those subscribers to understand how the tools that I
have developed and published work and how they can contribute.

One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate and
'come to life' (and I don't blame them for not participating, I blame
myself)

What Owasp needs now are strong, creative and active leaders who will have
to continuously prove (i.e. every week, every month, every year) that they
deserve to be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers
projects.

In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must guarantee
and fight for 

    1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and 
    2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join and be (if desired)
a non-contributor member)

, is because when Leaders stop behaving accordingly to his/hers
responsibilities (for personal or professional reasons) his/hers replacement
(amicably or not) must be an relatively easy and strait-forward process
(following the wishes of that project's community). 

As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an Owasp Leader can only be an
Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and recognizes his/hers
leadership (see the Linus example). 

In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where the
focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as
possible) in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.

B) My comments on .... Jeff as a OWASP leader

Before I go any further let me just say that:

    - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in Owasp
    - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the creation of the Owasp
Foundation
    - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous when he accepted (from
Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader
    - I think that Jeff should continue to have some management roles in
Owasp 

But I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader,
since I don't think that Jeff has (based on his actions so far) what I would
consider to be the right profile to be the main leader that Owasp needs
today

Although Jeff is beyond doubt a very active and productive Owasp member
(whose technical competence and professionalism is of the highest caliber) I
don't think that Jeff (to which I sincerely apologize for such a public
criticism) has the energy, vision and 'craziness' required to lead a project
like Owasp (as it is today). Maybe it is Jeff's training as a Lawyer that
makes him risk-adverse, maybe it is just his personally, and maybe it is
just the current phase that Owasp is currently in (there is no reason why
Jeff's profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten
years time).

What Owasp needs now is to have an energetic, dynamic, thought provoking and
inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into a being major player in the Web
Application Security World, and help it to make the world a 'safer' (and
better) place.

at the current moment in time), I think that Owasp should ( in the short
term) NOT HAVE A MAIN LEADER! 

In the short term, Owasp should only have operational-leaders (or whatever
they would be called) responsible for specific operational tasks (for
example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the Owasp
servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business
development exercises, etc...).

Hopefully the crisis created by Mark's departure will create an environment
where the new future Owasp Leader will appear, and his/her promotion to
Owasp leadership is accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and
Members.


C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP

Another factor which in my view is not helping the development of Owasp is
the fact that Owasp is trying to do something that the security industry
doesn't want to happen. For example: 

    - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web Application
Security,
    - the Development of Open Source security tools, 
    - and ultimately addressing the real problems that are creating the
current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'

Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too much
money with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in
actually solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their
markets). 

The reality is that the ones that have most to benefit from Owasp, are the
current 'Security products/services buyers' because these are the ones that
are currently buying overpriced and incomplete products/solutions. The
problem is that these 'entities' (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs,
persons) need to have something to buy (which OWASP currently doesn't have)
and are used to (and demand/expect) a credible, professional and reliable
service.

In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the Security
Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) and
should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, etc...)
which have most to benefit from Owasp work.

The current Owasp successes (like the wide spread usage of the Top 10) must
be built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and
perceived independence is one of Owasp biggest assets


D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'

I also find fascinating the fact that the current Owasp-dotNet leader (i.e.
me) has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team
regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published:

    - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)
    - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting Environment (SAM'SHE)
    - Asp.Net Reflector
    - Online Metabase explorer

The only logic explanation that I have for this situation (since these tools
DO actually work and have helped hundreds of companies to improve their
Asp.Net hosting environments) is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse'
these tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current
Full Trust Asp.Net environment is.

Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the industry,
since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a vibrant
development community continuously developing and improving these tools. The
reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,  is because
Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies to
security issues and  shows how low the current level is :-(. 

For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): 

    1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), 
    2) think that they are not doing enough, and 
    3) say that they are making a massive mistake with their current lack of
acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net Vulnerabilities;

, based on my professional experience, I still think that Microsoft DOES
TAKE Security much more Seriously than most other Software companies out
there (which again shows how we are still very far away from starting to
tackle the real security problems and vulnerabilities that exist in today's
Web Applications).

E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp

Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a crazy-open-source-guy which
lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to state, that I fully understand
that Money and Financial reward is a major element in our current society
and way of live. I am not anti-corporations, anti-capitalism or anti-making
money.

We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you manage to
get paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for
it)

I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that position
where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do for
free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to Owasp,
is the fact that a substantial percentage of my income for the past 6 months
originated in projects directly related to my participation and
contributions to Owasp.

Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that I
received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: Thank
you Owasp

In some ways I am a good success-story of how Owasp can directly and
indirectly provide a good financial and professional reward to active and
participative members.

I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in certain
areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), Owasp has the
opportunity to become a 'recruitment center' for high-skilled, reliable and
effective developers (since all that the employers would need to do is to
look at the prospective employee participation and contribution record)

F) My comments on ... the fact that most Owasp projects have no
participation from the community

In my view there are several reasons why most Owasp Projects don't have more
than 2 to 5 active participants:

    1) lack of time: Most good and knowledgeable members are currently very
busy and have very little time to dedicate to personal projects

    2) the current '2h to start being productive' paradigm: which means that
if I (for example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate
at least 2 hours to the project in order to start being productive
(sometimes even for simple things like adding content to the new website!).
What we need is the '30m to start being productive' paradigm or even better
the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when functional,
actually create an environment where participants regularly spend 2 hours or
more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the ones that don't
know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to practice a
music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), you must create
an environment where there is there is almost no effort required to start
practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be able to
start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). This
means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always be
set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow for
spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) when
the musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which usually
gets 'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment
where it is easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not
associated with spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.

    3) Most Owasp projects don't have clear 'this is want you can do to
participate' instructions and require quite a lot of work and effort by the
would-be contributors and participants

    4) Owasp memberships is not big enough where there are enough people
with an 'itch' (i.e. problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's
'itch', which will make them go one step further and spend the time, effort
and dedication required to become an active participant and member

    5) Most projects are very dependent on the availability and energy-level
of the project leader (which usually is also its author / creator).
Hopefully we will soon reach a critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?)
where the community surrounding a project is vibrant enough to compensate
for the regular MIA (Missing in Action) periods

    6) and probably the most important one. Collaborating in an Open Source
project is VERY HARD. Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD
claims such as 'Open Source projects are created by a network of Kids and
clueless programmers' (note that I am a non-violent person and very rarely
get angry). Sending a comment like "humm, i clicked on this button and the
application crashed" is very easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment
like "I installed the application and I had a problem with XYZ function
which I traced back to the method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it
which solved the problem" or "I've read this 50 page document and here are
my comments" is :

    - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code or words)
    - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT
MATTER
    - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, 
    - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in effect sending a
criticism of someone else's work)
    - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. "...I think that this
is a better way to do it...") which is always a hard thing to do
    - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that project's leader) PAST
BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS 

So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of
contributions of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open
Source projects have as their main contributors highly intelligent,
competent, dedicated and creative IT Professionals. 


G) My comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp Projects

Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first person and say
that I am as guilty of anybody else for not participating in other Owasp
projects. 

I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat,
WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide, since
I have used them professionally.

And the reasons that I have for not participating are:

    -  I didn't have the required time to put myself in a position where I
was able to send meaningful contributions 
    - Those project leaders didn't put any pressure on me to participate and
didn't actively encourage it (when one is working on several projects at the
same time, unfortunately the projects that don't make any noise and are not
critical tend to live permanently on the
'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)
    - There is almost no documentation to help  (although I do admit that I
didn't make a huge effort to find it)
    - I didn't need professionally an improved version of those
tools/documents (i.e. I didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are
scratching)

To start contributing in these projects I needed to be given simple, quick
and meaningful (i.e. could be used in the actual project) tasks (the '30m
task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I should
participate. 

I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must
subconsciously feel that my efforts will be appreciated.

I am assuming that If motivated and focused I  would produce material of
high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although
anybody should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no
duty to spend any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the
appropriate skills, knowledge, attitude or commitment)

And this is the bottom line: it is the leaders of these projects (WebGoat,
WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test list) that
have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to participate, and if they
don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then they should 
    1) step down (from leaders), 
    2) become 'normal' project members, 
    3) continue to submit their contributions  and 
    4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another Owasp member that is
willing to do it.

Now, does my lack of participation on these projects make me a 'taker'!
Somebody that is 'exploiting' the work of the talented and dedicated persons
who worked on this projects? Do I deserve (due to my lack of participation)
to be kicked out of the current mailing lists and not be member of those
projects?

H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp

I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in OWASP today. 

It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open Source)
that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the
Owasp-dotNet efforts.

Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the same
ideals and it is always very refreshing when one meets other like-minded
individuals.

Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to help
Owasp in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly
responsible for his decision. The main reason I am writing this 'Open Letter
to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain and Owasp is able to
learn from its mistakes and change the current environment which caused one
of Owasp most important members to quit.

Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must have
been for him to take this decision. 

I hope that this 'Open Letter to Owasp' kick-starts a healthy discussion and
is well received by the other Owasp Leaders and Members. 

Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out of
order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do let
me know. 

I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals are not
welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit and
find (or create) another Community

I) My comments on ...how Owasp can make money:

Just before I get into practical solutions (because one cannot only talk,
one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where Owasp can
make money:

 - Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants 
 - Owasp Consultancy 
 - Owasp Accreditations 
 - Owasp Official Curriculum
 - Owasp Books and White papers
 - Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)
 - Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)
 - Owasp Conferences

And what could this money be used for? 

In my view it should be used to pay for:

    - Owasp Administrative services 
    - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) Owasp Projects
    - Creation of Documentation
    - Packaging of Owasp Products 
    - Marketing and PR
    - Sales
    - Support to Owasp's product or services 


J) Ideas for the Future:

Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point Owasp in the right
direction:

     - In the short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader, since this
position (which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be earned
not given. This means that the next Owasp's leader should be chosen by
Owasp's Leaders with full support by Owasp's community

    - Jeff should continue to have several responsibilities within Owasp
management, but current Owasp leaders should be able to say "I would like to
take responsibility for 'XYZ' task" 

     - The current Owasp leaders should do what I recommended earlier and
actively encourage their communities to participate in their project.

     - The current Owasp leaders should also make an effort to participate
in each others projects.

    - A series of 30m tasks should be defined for each project, which will
allow the Owasp members to easily contribute and participate

    - On the short term, Owasp must have a CMS (Content Management System)
solution which allows authorized members to QUICKLY (in minutes) and EASILY
(not too many clicks) add content to the LIVE SERVER Hosting the main Owasp
and individual project's websites. I don't care if this is done with the
current Magnolia solution, with b-sec's CMS (support.binaryvision.com.au), a
very Expensive donated CMS (www.tomoye.com <http://www.tomoye.com> ), with
FrontPage, with Dreamweaver or with NOTEPAD!!!! What I want is something
that doesn't get in the way, and I can get my content uploaded and published
to Owasp website in 10m. And (please don't kill me for this), in the
beginning I don't really care about how secure this system is. The first
objective is to create a dynamic, vibrant and very active community. If we
get maliciously hacked, then so be it!!!  Note that I am not saying that
Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a template) a secure
hosting environment. Just to avoid confusions let me say it again: "I do
think that Owasp should host its online content in an locked down
environment which is as secure as possible". What I trying to say is that
the current priority should be in creating vibrant communities (which could,
as one of its projects build a tool to create and configure secure hosting
environments)

    - There must be total clarity of Owasp finances and financial
operations. The current lack of transparency is not healthy and doesn't
promote contributions. I know that there are some short-term credibility
issues with the current low-turnover but I strongly believe that the
advantages of full openness are far bigger than the disadvantages.

    - Once the current Owasp finances are published, a short term investment
plan should be created which defines what Owasp wants to do, how much money
it requires, and where is that money going to come from (for example I can
(through my UK company) make some financial contributions to OWASP)

    - A series of 'Owasp Products' should be created (based on the current
Owasp projects) and sold online

    - Owasp should take a much more aggressive position in the Industry and
start making its Voice heard. And if this creates controversy, then so be it
(the open letter sent last month was a good start). From my point of view,
the moment Owasp starts to be attacked by 'respected' security companies and
organizations, is the moment that Owasp is starting to do its job right and
is starting to change the world
   
    - A formal Owasp Leader recognition process should be created which
publicly recognizes current Owasp Leaders and most active Project
contributors (since this will help those person's careers and will encourage
others to become leaders them selfs)

    - A formal 'Thank you' letter should be sent to Mark (signed by as many
members as possible) as a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for
Owasp

    - A meeting should take place to discuss this (and other) ideas

I hope that this made sense and if you made it this far, thanks for your
patience for reading this long, rambling and of my entire responsibility
'Open Letter to Owasp'

I'm looking forward to your comments

Best regards

Dinis Cruz

in a Crisis!</span></font></b><br>
<br>
Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of =
the most
active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his =
reasons
for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an environment =
where the
necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) prevents the departure of other key players and =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that =
Mark (and
others) will want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.<br>
<br>
As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues =
to be a
big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of =
measures
and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end of =
this
'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my personal =
opinion on
several issues which I think are very relevant to the current Owasp
environment/situation.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>A) My comments on .... =
&quot;Owasp's vs Open
Source&quot;<br>
<br>
</span></b>Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the =
moment, in
the Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source =
should
deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD =
LIKE to
happen.<br>
<br>
I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting =
the
concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).<br>

code
published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and can be =
shared
and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is FREE (as in =
beer,
i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good inevitable practicality =
(since
if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM would not exist). <br>
<br>
Starting to <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>complain that 1) most =
Owasp
members are 'takers' instead of 'givers' and 2) they are only =
interested in
getting from Owasp things for FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in =
my view: </span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>offensive =
</span></b>to
those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they are being =
called:
thieves, opportunistic and selfish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>short-sighted</span></b>,
since there is much more than meets the eye (things are never black or =
white)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>counter-productive</span></b>,
since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad feelings amongst the
community, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Missing the =
point</span></b>,
since the main discussion point should be always about FREEDOM and not =
about
COST<br>
<br>
Going further, from my point of view, <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>blaming
the current lack of participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of =
the
current Owasp community</span></b> (which are being labeled as 'takers' =
and not
'givers')<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> is merely a scapegoat =
exercise
which fails to address the core problems and doesn't allows for the =
real issue
to be dealt with.</span></b><br>
<br>
In my view, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>it is not the =
responsibility and
duty of the current Owasp members</span></b> (for example the persons
subscribed to the current mailing lists) <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>to

projects.</span></b><br>
<br>
In my view, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>IT IS THE SPECIFIC =

dedication
and patience by those project leaders. <br>
<br>
This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - make everybody aware of what is going on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks =
which can be
executed by the community (it should be possible for somebody that =
wants to
contribute to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which =
will not
take him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the =
current
situation))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - actively market the Owasp project and encourage
participation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - manage expectations and ensure that the project's =
members
are motivated and happy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ensure that all contributions are respectively =
credited
and that people are rewarded for their time and commitment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create products based on that Project's =
deliverables
(white papers, tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by =
Owasp<br>
<br>
Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project =
manager
experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand
statements, specially since&nbsp;<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I =
consider
that I</span></b> (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp leader of the Owasp-dotNet
projects) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>am a very BAD LEADER =
because I was
not able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate =
in the
current Owasp-dotNet projects</span></b> (I am including myself in the
guilty-list). I have also been very bad at replying to contributors =
(sorry
specially to Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) =
and
should have done much more to help those subscribers to understand how =
the
tools that I have developed and published work and how they can =
contribute.<br>
<br>
One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate and =
'come
to life' (and <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I don't blame them =
for not
participating, I blame myself</span></b>)<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What Owasp needs now are strong, =
creative and
active leaders who will have to continuously prove </span></b>(i.e. =
every week,
every month, every year) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>that they =
deserve to
be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers =
projects.</span></b><br>
<br>
In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must =
guarantee and
fight for <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join =
and be
(if desired) a non-contributor member)<br>
<br>
, is because <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>when Leaders stop =
behaving
accordingly to his/hers responsibilities</span></b> (for personal or
professional reasons) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>his/hers =
replacement </span></b>(amicably
or not) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>must be an relatively easy =
and
strait-forward process </span></b>(following the wishes of that =
project's
community). <br>
<br>
As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp
Leader can only be an Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and
recognizes his/hers leadership</span></b> (see the Linus example). <br>
<br>
In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where =
the
focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as =
possible)
in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>B) My comments on .... Jeff as a =
OWASP leader</span></b><br>
<br>
Before I go any further let me just say that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in =
Owasp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the =
creation
of the Owasp Foundation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous =
when he accepted
(from Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff should continue to have some =
management
roles in Owasp <br>
<br>
But <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD =
CONTINUE
TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader,</span></b> since I don't think that Jeff =
has
(based on his actions so far) what I would consider to be the right =
profile to
be the main leader that Owasp needs today<br>
<br>
Although <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Jeff is beyond doubt a =
very active
and productive Owasp member </span></b>(whose technical competence and
professionalism is of the highest caliber)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I
don't think that Jeff</span></b> (to which I sincerely apologize for =
such a
public criticism)<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> has the energy, =
vision and
'craziness' required to lead a project like Owasp (as it is =
today)</span></b>.
Maybe it is Jeff's training as a Lawyer that makes him risk-adverse, =
maybe it
is just his personally, and maybe it is just the current phase that =
Owasp is
currently in (<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>there is no reason =
why Jeff's
profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten =
years time</span></b>).<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What Owasp needs now is to have an =
energetic,
dynamic, thought provoking and inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into =
a being
major player in the Web Application Security World,</span></b> and help =
it to
make the world a 'safer' (and better) place.<br>
<br>
From&nbsp; my point of view,&nbsp; <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>unless
Mark retakes the Job</span></b> (which is not an option at the current =
moment
in time), <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I think that Owasp should =
</span></b>(
in the short term) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>NOT HAVE A MAIN =
LEADER! </span></b><br>
<br>
In the short term, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp should =
only have
operational-leaders</span></b> (or whatever they would be called) =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>responsible for specific operational tasks =
</span></b>(for
example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the =
Owasp
servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business
development exercises, etc...).<br>
<br>
Hopefully the <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>crisis created by Mark=
's
departure will create an environment where the new future Owasp Leader =
will
appear, </span></b>and his/her promotion to Owasp leadership is
accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and Members.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP<br>
<br>
</span></b>Another factor which in my view is not helping the =
development of
Owasp is the fact that <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp is =
trying to do
something that the security industry doesn't want to happen</span></b>. =
For
example: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web
Application Security,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the Development of Open Source security tools, =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - and ultimately addressing the real problems that =
are
creating the current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'<br>
<br>
Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too =
much money
with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in =
actually
solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their =
markets). <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The reality is that the ones that =
have most
to benefit from Owasp, are the current 'Security products/services =
buyers' </span></b>because
these are the ones that are currently buying overpriced and incomplete
products/solutions. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The problem is =
that these
'entities'</span></b> (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs, =
persons) <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>need to have something to buy</span></b> =
(which OWASP
currently doesn't have) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>and are =
used to</span></b>
(and demand/expect) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>a credible, =
professional
and reliable service</span></b>.<br>
<br>
In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the =
Security
Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) =
and
should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, =
etc...) which
have most to benefit from Owasp work.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The current Owasp =
successes</span></b> (like
the wide spread usage of the Top 10) <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>must be
built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and =
perceived
independence is one of Owasp biggest assets</span></b><br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'</span></b><br>
<br>
I also find fascinating the fact that <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>the
current Owasp-dotNet leader</span></b> (i.e. me)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:
bold'> has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team
regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published</span></b>:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting
Environment (SAM'SHE)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Reflector<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Online Metabase explorer<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The only logic explanation =
</span></b>that I
have for this situation (since these tools DO actually work and have =
helped
hundreds of companies to improve their Asp.Net hosting environments) =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse' =
these
tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current =
Full
Trust Asp.Net environment is</span></b>.<br>
<br>
Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the =
industry,
since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a =
vibrant
development community continuously developing and improving these =
tools. The
reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,&nbsp; is =
because
Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies =
to
security issues and&nbsp; shows how low the current level is :-(. <br>
<br>
For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) think that they are not doing enough, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) say that they are making a massive mistake with =
their
current lack of acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net
Vulnerabilities;<br>
<br>
, based on my professional experience, I still think that <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Microsoft DOES TAKE Security much more =
Seriously than
most other Software companies out there</span></b> (which again shows =
how we
are still very far away from starting to tackle the real security =
problems and
vulnerabilities that exist in today's Web Applications).<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp<br>
<br>
</span></b>Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a
crazy-open-source-guy which lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to =
state,
that I fully understand that Money and Financial reward is a major =
element in
our current society and way of live. I am not anti-corporations,
anti-capitalism or anti-making money.<br>
<br>
We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you =
manage to get
paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for =
it)<br>
<br>
I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that =
position
where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do =
for
free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to =
Owasp, is
the fact that a <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>substantial =
percentage of my
income for the past 6 months originated in projects directly related to =
my
participation and contributions to Owasp</span></b>.<br>
<br>
Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that =
I
received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Thank you Owasp</span></b><br>
<br>
In some ways I am a good success-story of how <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp
can directly and indirectly provide a good financial and professional =
reward to
active and participative members.</span></b><br>
<br>
I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in =
certain
areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp has the opportunity to become a =
'recruitment
center' for high-skilled, reliable and effective developers</span></b> =
(since
all that the employers would need to do is to look at the prospective =
employee
participation and contribution record)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
</span></b><br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>F) My comments on ... the fact that =
most
Owasp projects have no participation from the community<br>
<br>
</span></b>In my view there are several <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>reasons
why most Owasp Projects don't have more than 2 to 5 active =
participants</span></b>:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>lack of time: =
</span></b>Most
good and knowledgeable members are currently very busy and have very =
little
time to dedicate to personal projects<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>the current =
'2h to
start being productive' paradigm</span></b>: which means that if I (for
example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate at =
least 2
hours to the project in order to start being productive (sometimes even =
for
simple things like adding content to the new website!). <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What we need is the</span></b> <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>'30m to start being productive' paradigm =
</span></b>or
even better the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when
functional, actually create an environment where participants regularly =
spend 2
hours or more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the =
ones that
don't know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to
practice a music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), =
you
must create an environment where there is there is almost no effort =
required to
start practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be =
able to
start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). =
This
means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always =
be
set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow =
for
spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) =
when the
musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which usually =
gets
'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment =
where it is
easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not =
associated with
spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Most Owasp =
projects
don't have clear 'this is want you can do to participate' =
instructions</span></b>
and require quite a lot of work and effort by the would-be contributors =
and
participants<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp =
memberships is
not big enough </span></b>where there are enough people with an 'itch' =
(i.e.
problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's 'itch', which =
will make
them go one step further and spend the time, effort and dedication =
required to
become an active participant and member<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Most projects =
are very
dependent on the availability and energy-level of the project =
leader</span></b>
(which usually is also its author / creator). Hopefully we will soon =
reach a
critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?) where the community =
surrounding a
project is vibrant enough to compensate for the regular MIA (Missing in =
Action)
periods<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) and probably the most important one. <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Collaborating in an Open Source project is =
VERY HARD</span></b>.
Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD claims such as =
'Open Source
projects are created by a network of Kids and clueless programmers' =
(note that
I am a non-violent person and very rarely get angry). Sending a comment =
like
&quot;humm, i clicked on this button and the application crashed&quot; =
is very
easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment like &quot;I installed =
the
application and I had a problem with XYZ function which I traced back =
to the
method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it which solved the =
problem&quot;
or &quot;I've read this 50 page document and here are my comments&quot; =
is :<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code =
or
words)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR
TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT MATTER<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in =
effect
sending a criticism of someone else's work)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. =
&quot;...I
think that this is a better way to do it...&quot;) which is always a =
hard thing
to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that =
project's
leader) PAST BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS <br>
<br>
So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of =
contributions
of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open Source =
projects have
as their main contributors highly intelligent, competent, dedicated and
creative IT Professionals. <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
G) My comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp =
Projects<br>
<br>
</span></b>Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first =
person
and say that<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I am as guilty of =
anybody else
for not participating in other Owasp projects. <br>
</span></b><br>
I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat, =
WebScarab,
Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide, since I =
have used
them professionally.<br>
<br>
And the <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>reasons that I have for not
participating are:</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I didn't =
have</span></b>
the required <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>time </span></b>to put =
myself in
a position where I was able to send meaningful contributions <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Those<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> project =
leaders
didn't put any pressure on me to participate and didn't actively =
encourage it</span></b>
(when one is working on several projects at the same time, =
unfortunately the
projects that don't make any noise and are not critical tend to live
permanently on the 'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There is almost <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>no
documentation to help</span></b>&nbsp; (although I do admit that I =
didn't make
a huge effort to find it)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>didn't need
professionally an improved version of those tools/documents</span></b> =
(i.e. I
didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are scratching)<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>To start contributing in these =
projects I
needed to be given simple, quick and meaningful</span></b> (i.e. could =
be used
in the actual project) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>tasks =
</span></b>(the
'30m task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I =
should
participate. <br>
<br>
I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must =
subconsciously
feel that my efforts will be appreciated.<br>
<br>
I am assuming that If motivated and focused I&nbsp; would produce =
material of
high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although =
anybody
should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no duty =
to spend
any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the appropriate =
skills,
knowledge, attitude or commitment)<br>
<br>
And this is the bottom line:<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> it is =
the
leaders of these projects </span></b>(WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, =
Testing
Guide and the Penetration Test list)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'> that
have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to =
participate</span></b>, and
if they don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then =
they
should <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) step down (from leaders), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) become 'normal' project members, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) continue to submit their contributions&nbsp; and =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another =
Owasp member
that is willing to do it.<br>
<br>
Now, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>does my lack of participation =
on these
projects make me a 'taker'! </span></b>Somebody that is 'exploiting' =
the work
of the talented and dedicated persons who worked on this projects? =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Do I deserve</span></b> (due to my lack of =
participation)
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>to be kicked out of the current =
mailing lists
and not be member of those projects?<br>
<br>
H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp<br>
<br>
</span></b>I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in =
OWASP
today. <br>
<br>
It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open =
Source)
that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the
Owasp-dotNet efforts.<br>
<br>
Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the =
same ideals
and it is always very refreshing when one meets other like-minded =
individuals.<br>
<br>
Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to =
help Owasp
in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly =
responsible for
his decision. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The main reason I am =
writing
this 'Open Letter to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain =
and
Owasp is able to learn from its mistakes and change the current =
environment
which caused one of Owasp most important members to =
quit.</span></b><br>
<br>
Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must =
have been
for him to take this decision. <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I hope that this 'Open Letter to =
Owasp'
kick-starts a healthy discussion and is well received by the other =
Owasp
Leaders and Members. </span></b><br>
<br>
Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out =
of
order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do =
let me
know. <br>
<br>
I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals =
are not
welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit =
and find
(or create) another Community<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I) My comments on ...how Owasp can =
make
money:<br>
<br>
</span></b>Just before I get into practical solutions (because one =
cannot only
talk, one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where =
Owasp can
make money:<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
<br>
</span></b>&nbsp;- Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Consultancy <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Accreditations <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Official Curriculum<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Books and White papers<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Conferences<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
And what could this money be used for? <br>
<br>
In my view it should be used to pay for:</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Owasp Administrative services <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) =
Owasp
Projects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Creation of Documentation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Packaging of Owasp Products <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Marketing and PR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sales<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Support to Owasp's product or services <br>
<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>J) Ideas for the Future:<br>
<br>
</span></b>Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point =
Owasp in the
right direction:<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
<br>

Starting to complain that 1) most Owasp members are 'takers' instead of 'givers' and 2) they are only interested in getting from Owasp things for FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in my view: 

    - offensive to those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they are being called: thieves, opportunistic and selfish
    - short-sighted, since there is much more than meets the eye (things are never black or white)
    - counter-productive, since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad feelings amongst the community, and 
    - Missing the point, since the main discussion point should be always about FREEDOM and not about COST

Going further, from my point of view, blaming the current lack of participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of the current Owasp community (which are being labeled as 'takers' and not 'givers') is merely a scapegoat exercise which fails to address the core problems and doesn't allows for the real issue to be dealt with.

In my view, it is not the responsibility and duty of the current Owasp members (for example the persons subscribed to the current mailing lists) to be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of time to those projects.

In my view, IT IS THE SPECIFIC OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT where those project's members (and the other Owasp leaders) fell motivated to participate and become active members. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work, dedication and patience by those project leaders. 

This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: 

    - make everybody aware of what is going on
    - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which can be executed by the community (it should be possible for somebody that wants to contribute to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which will not take him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the current situation))
    - actively market the Owasp project and encourage participation
    - manage expectations and ensure that the project's members are motivated and happy
    - ensure that all contributions are respectively credited and that people are rewarded for their time and commitment
    - create products based on that Project's deliverables (white papers, tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by Owasp

Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project manager experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand statements, specially since  I consider that I (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp leader of the Owasp-dotNet projects) am a very BAD LEADER because I was not able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in the current Owasp-dotNet projects (I am including myself in the guilty-list). I have also been very bad at replying to contributors (sorry specially to Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) and should have done much more to help those subscribers to understand how the tools that I have developed and published work and how they can contribute.

One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate and 'come to life' (and I don't blame them for not participating, I blame myself)

What Owasp needs now are strong, creative and active leaders who will have to continuously prove (i.e. every week, every month, every year) that they deserve to be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers projects.

In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must guarantee and fight for 

    1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and 
    2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join and be (if desired) a non-contributor member)

, is because when Leaders stop behaving accordingly to his/hers responsibilities (for personal or professional reasons) his/hers replacement (amicably or not) must be an relatively easy and strait-forward process (following the wishes of that project's community). 

As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an Owasp Leader can only be an Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and recognizes his/hers leadership (see the Linus example). 

In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where the focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as possible) in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.

B) My comments on .... Jeff as a OWASP leader

Before I go any further let me just say that:

    - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in Owasp
    - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the creation of the Owasp Foundation
    - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous when he accepted (from Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader
    - I think that Jeff should continue to have some management roles in Owasp 

But I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader, since I don't think that Jeff has (based on his actions so far) what I would consider to be the right profile to be the main leader that Owasp needs today

Although Jeff is beyond doubt a very active and productive Owasp member (whose technical competence and professionalism is of the highest caliber) I don't think that Jeff (to which I sincerely apologize for such a public criticism) has the energy, vision and 'craziness' required to lead a project like Owasp (as it is today). Maybe it is Jeff's training as a Lawyer that makes him risk-adverse, maybe it is just his personally, and maybe it is just the current phase that Owasp is currently in (there is no reason why Jeff's profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten years time).

What Owasp needs now is to have an energetic, dynamic, thought provoking and inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into a being major player in the Web Application Security World, and help it to make the world a 'safer' (and better) place.

In the short term, Owasp should only have operational-leaders (or whatever they would be called) responsible for specific operational tasks (for example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the Owasp servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business development exercises, etc...).

Hopefully the crisis created by Mark's departure will create an environment where the new future Owasp Leader will appear, and his/her promotion to Owasp leadership is accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and Members.


C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP

Another factor which in my view is not helping the development of Owasp is the fact that Owasp is trying to do something that the security industry doesn't want to happen. For example: 

    - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web Application Security,
    - the Development of Open Source security tools, 
    - and ultimately addressing the real problems that are creating the current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'

Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too much money with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in actually solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their markets). 

The reality is that the ones that have most to benefit from Owasp, are the current 'Security products/services buyers' because these are the ones that are currently buying overpriced and incomplete products/solutions. The problem is that these 'entities' (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs, persons) need to have something to buy (which OWASP currently doesn't have) and are used to (and demand/expect) a credible, professional and reliable service.

In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the Security Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) and should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, etc...) which have most to benefit from Owasp work.

The current Owasp successes (like the wide spread usage of the Top 10) must be built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and perceived independence is one of Owasp biggest assets


D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'

I also find fascinating the fact that the current Owasp-dotNet leader (i.e. me) has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published:

    - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)
    - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting Environment (SAM'SHE)
    - Asp.Net Reflector
    - Online Metabase explorer

The only logic explanation that I have for this situation (since these tools DO actually work and have helped hundreds of companies to improve their Asp.Net hosting environments) is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse' these tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current Full Trust Asp.Net environment is.

Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the industry, since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a vibrant development community continuously developing and improving these tools. The reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,  is because Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies to security issues and  shows how low the current level is :-(. 

For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): 

    1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), 
    2) think that they are not doing enough, and 
    3) say that they are making a massive mistake with their current lack of acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net Vulnerabilities;

, based on my professional experience, I still think that Microsoft DOES TAKE Security much more Seriously than most other Software companies out there (which again shows how we are still very far away from starting to tackle the real security problems and vulnerabilities that exist in today's Web Applications).

E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp

Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a crazy-open-source-guy which lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to state, that I fully understand that Money and Financial reward is a major element in our current society and way of live. I am not anti-corporations, anti-capitalism or anti-making money.

We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you manage to get paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for it)

I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that position where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do for free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to Owasp, is the fact that a substantial percentage of my income for the past 6 months originated in projects directly related to my participation and contributions to Owasp.

Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that I received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: Thank you Owasp

In some ways I am a good success-story of how Owasp can directly and indirectly provide a good financial and professional reward to active and participative members.

I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in certain areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), Owasp has the opportunity to become a 'recruitment center' for high-skilled, reliable and effective developers (since all that the employers would need to do is to look at the prospective employee participation and contribution record)

F) My comments on ... the fact that most Owasp projects have no participation from the community

In my view there are several reasons why most Owasp Projects don't have more than 2 to 5 active participants:

    1) lack of time: Most good and knowledgeable members are currently very busy and have very little time to dedicate to personal projects

    2) the current '2h to start being productive' paradigm: which means that if I (for example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate at least 2 hours to the project in order to start being productive (sometimes even for simple things like adding content to the new website!). What we need is the '30m to start being productive' paradigm or even better the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when functional, actually create an environment where participants regularly spend 2 hours or more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the ones that don't know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to practice a music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), you must create an environment where there is there is almost no effort required to start practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be able to start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). This means that your musical
 instrument and practice environment must always be set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow for spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) when the musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which usually gets 'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment where it is easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not associated with spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.

    3) Most Owasp projects don't have clear 'this is want you can do to participate' instructions and require quite a lot of work and effort by the would-be contributors and participants

    4) Owasp memberships is not big enough where there are enough people with an 'itch' (i.e. problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's 'itch', which will make them go one step further and spend the time, effort and dedication required to become an active participant and member

    5) Most projects are very dependent on the availability and energy-level of the project leader (which usually is also its author / creator). Hopefully we will soon reach a critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?) where the community surrounding a project is vibrant enough to compensate for the regular MIA (Missing in Action) periods

    6) and probably the most important one. Collaborating in an Open Source project is VERY HARD. Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD claims such as 'Open Source projects are created by a network of Kids and clueless programmers' (note that I am a non-violent person and very rarely get angry). Sending a comment like "humm, i clicked on this button and the application crashed" is very easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment like "I installed the application and I had a problem with XYZ function which I traced back to the method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it which solved the problem" or "I've read this 50 page document and here are my comments" is :

    - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code or words)
    - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT MATTER
    - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, 
    - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in effect sending a criticism of someone else's work)
    - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. "...I think that this is a better way to do it...") which is always a hard thing to do
    - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that project's leader) PAST BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS 

So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of contributions of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open Source projects have as their main contributors highly intelligent, competent, dedicated and creative IT Professionals. 


G) My comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp Projects

Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first person and say that I am as guilty of anybody else for not participating in other Owasp projects. 

I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide, since I have used them professionally.

And the reasons that I have for not participating are:

    -  I didn't have the required time to put myself in a position where I was able to send meaningful contributions 
    - Those project leaders didn't put any pressure on me to participate and didn't actively encourage it (when one is working on several projects at the same time, unfortunately the projects that don't make any noise and are not critical tend to live permanently on the 'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)
    - There is almost no documentation to help  (although I do admit that I didn't make a huge effort to find it)
    - I didn't need professionally an improved version of those tools/documents (i.e. I didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are scratching)

To start contributing in these projects I needed to be given simple, quick and meaningful (i.e. could be used in the actual project) tasks (the '30m task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I should participate. 

I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must subconsciously feel that my efforts will be appreciated.

I am assuming that If motivated and focused I  would produce material of high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although anybody should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no duty to spend any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the appropriate skills, knowledge, attitude or commitment)

And this is the bottom line: it is the leaders of these projects (WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test list) that have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to participate, and if they don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then they should 
    1) step down (from leaders), 
    2) become 'normal' project members, 
    3) continue to submit their contributions  and 
    4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another Owasp member that is willing to do it.

Now, does my lack of participation on these projects make me a 'taker'! Somebody that is 'exploiting' the work of the talented and dedicated persons who worked on this projects? Do I deserve (due to my lack of participation) to be kicked out of the current mailing lists and not be member of those projects?

H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp

I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in OWASP today. 

It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open Source) that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the Owasp-dotNet efforts.

Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the same ideals and it is always very refreshing when one meets other like-minded individuals.

Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to help Owasp in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly responsible for his decision. The main reason I am writing this 'Open Letter to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain and Owasp is able to learn from its mistakes and change the current environment which caused one of Owasp most important members to quit.

Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must have been for him to take this decision. 

I hope that this 'Open Letter to Owasp' kick-starts a healthy discussion and is well received by the other Owasp Leaders and Members. 

Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out of order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do let me know. 

I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals are not welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit and find (or create) another Community

I) My comments on ...how Owasp can make money:

Just before I get into practical solutions (because one cannot only talk, one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where Owasp can make money:

 - Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants 
 - Owasp Consultancy 
 - Owasp Accreditations 
 - Owasp Official Curriculum
 - Owasp Books and White papers
 - Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)
 - Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)
 - Owasp Conferences

And what could this money be used for? 

In my view it should be used to pay for:

    - Owasp Administrative services 
    - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) Owasp Projects
    - Creation of Documentation
    - Packaging of Owasp Products 
    - Marketing and PR
    - Sales
    - Support to Owasp's product or services 


J) Ideas for the Future:

Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point Owasp in the right direction:

     - In the short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader, since this position (which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be earned not given. This means that the next Owasp's leader should be chosen by Owasp's Leaders with full support by Owasp's community

    - Jeff should continue to have several responsibilities within Owasp management, but current Owasp leaders should be able to say "I would like to take responsibility for 'XYZ' task" 

     - The current Owasp leaders should do what I recommended earlier and actively encourage their communities to participate in their project.

     - The current Owasp leaders should also make an effort to participate in each others projects.

    - A series of 30m tasks should be defined for each project, which will allow the Owasp members to easily contribute and participate

    - On the short term, Owasp must have a CMS (Content Management System) solution which allows authorized members to QUICKLY (in minutes) and EASILY (not too many clicks) add content to the LIVE SERVER Hosting the main Owasp and individual project's websites. I don't care if this is done with the current Magnolia solution, with b-sec's CMS (support.binaryvision.com.au), a very Expensive donated CMS (www.tomoye.com), with FrontPage, with Dreamweaver or with NOTEPAD!!!! What I want is something that doesn't get in the way, and I can get my content uploaded and published to Owasp website in 10m. And (please don't kill me for this), in the beginning I don't really care about how secure this system is. The first objective is to create a dynamic, vibrant and very active community. If we get maliciously hacked, then so be it!!!  Note that I am not saying that Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a template) a secure hosting environment. Just to avoid confusions let me say it
 again: "I do think that Owasp should host its online content in an locked down environment which is as secure as possible". What I trying to say is that the current priority should be in creating vibrant communities (which could, as one of its projects build a tool to create and configure secure hosting environments)

    - There must be total clarity of Owasp finances and financial operations. The current lack of transparency is not healthy and doesn't promote contributions. I know that there are some short-term credibility issues with the current low-turnover but I strongly believe that the advantages of full openness are far bigger than the disadvantages.

    - Once the current Owasp finances are published, a short term investment plan should be created which defines what Owasp wants to do, how much money it requires, and where is that money going to come from (for example I can (through my UK company) make some financial contributions to OWASP)

    - A series of 'Owasp Products' should be created (based on the current Owasp projects) and sold online

    - Owasp should take a much more aggressive position in the Industry and start making its Voice heard. And if this creates controversy, then so be it (the open letter sent last month was a good start). From my point of view, the moment Owasp starts to be attacked by 'respected' security companies and organizations, is the moment that Owasp is starting to do its job right and is starting to change the world
   
    - A formal Owasp Leader recognition process should be created which publicly recognizes current Owasp Leaders and most active Project contributors (since this will help those person's careers and will encourage others to become leaders them selfs)

    - A formal 'Thank you' letter should be sent to Mark (signed by as many members as possible) as a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for Owasp

    - A meeting should take place to discuss this (and other) ideas

I hope that this made sense and if you made it this far, thanks for your patience for reading this long, rambling and of my entire responsibility 'Open Letter to Owasp'

I'm looking forward to your comments

Best regards

Dinis Cruz

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Your impassioned open letter is much needed and, hopefully, not too late. &nbsp;I support at least a large part of your thoughts on this subject and am keen to see progress made in much the way you advocate. &nbsp;However, a few observations from my personal POV:<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>

<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I would suggest that the success of Open Source projects is directly related to the nature and motivation of the community they serve. &nbsp;Linux succeeded in large part due to the fact that such a ?product? was immensely useful to its participants, who in large part were geeks who wanted to roll their own ?better? *NIX system. &nbsp;More than intellectually challenging, it provided a product that many individuals could use. &nbsp;However, looking at the OWASP community, I would suggest that the population is more oriented to Enterprises (like my company) and Software Shops. &nbsp;This immediately places a different slant on participants? motivations.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I don?t profess to speak for anyone but myself here, but my openly selfish objectives are two-fold: (a) align my company?s efforts with emerging de facto standards and (b) gain leverage for my seven-figure budget in application security. &nbsp;My preference is to do that with an ?open? standard and not with a vendor and if I can collaborate with my peers in other organizations, that?s even better.&nbsp; However, by the same token, I do not want to squander my hard-won budget on projects that do not deliver within the timeframe I need.&nbsp; Right now, I find it difficult to contribute unless I know that the efforts will bear fruit within reasonable time and that is a basic project management issue: project sponsorship and commitment.&nbsp; I am willing to contribute cash, hosted CMS systems and active staff participation, but I owe it
 to my company and its shareholders that this contribution achieves results. &nbsp;In short, I need guarantees that OWASP will be a force multiplier to my efforts. &nbsp;If you want to take OWASP out of academia and a pure hobbyists? realm, my suggestion is that OWASP needs to recognize these commercial needs.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This appears to me a classic project management issue: most projects fail when there is limited ?skin in the game? (read ?money?) and when project accountability is weak. &nbsp;My advocacy of a strong governance structure is targeted at exactly this issue. &nbsp;Membership funding focuses the mind.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Strong management, well funded, but who are held accountable for deliverables, is one way to approach this. &nbsp;This is the model the FS-ISAC uses and I suggest we need a similar model. That OWASP was born and survived so long is, in my mind, testimony to Mark?s inspirational qualities, but it is not a scalable architecture. &nbsp;True governance is needed to deflect some of my dollars to the project.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I believe that the best part of the Open Source model ? widespread contributions by motivated individuals and academia, as well as peer review ? need not be lost, so long as there is recognition that the main audience for the products is large organizations. &nbsp;One approach may be a paid membership, with fellowship status being awarded to individuals that have made significant contributions.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI></OL>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I welcome your challenge, but as with so many undertakings like this, critical mass is needed. &nbsp;I will continue to fund my own projects in this area and will make good on my promise to contribute these artifacts when done, but this will be done unilaterally until such time that enough of my peers and colleagues in other organizations recognize the opportunity we have to work more effectively under a new, revitalized OWASP organization.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>

Hopefully, this crisis will also create an environment where the necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) prevents the departure of other key players and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that Mark (and others) will want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.<BR><BR>As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues to be a big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of measures and suggestions for its future.

 personal opinion on several issues which I think are very relevant to the current Owasp environment/situation.<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A) My comments on .... "Owasp's vs Open Source"<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the moment, in the Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source should deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD LIKE to happen.<BR><BR>I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting the concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).<BR><BR>From my point of view, what matters is that the information and source code published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and can be shared and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good inevitable practicality (since if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM would not exist). <BR><BR>Starting to

This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work, dedication and patience by those project leaders. <BR><BR>This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - make everybody aware of what is going on<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which can be executed by the community (it should be possible for somebody that wants to contribute to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which will not take him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the current situation))<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - actively market the Owasp project and encourage participation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - manage expectations and ensure that the project's members are motivated and happy<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ensure that all contributions are respectively credited and that people are rewarded for their time and commitment<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create products based on that Project's
 deliverables (white papers, tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by Owasp<BR><BR>Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project manager experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand statements, specially since&nbsp;<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> I consider that I</SPAN></B> (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp leader of the Owasp-dotNet projects) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">am a very BAD LEADER because I was not able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in the current Owasp-dotNet projects</SPAN></B> (I am including myself in the guilty-list). I have also been very bad at replying to contributors (sorry specially to Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) and should have done much more to help those subscribers to understand how the tools that I have developed and published work and how they can contribute.<BR><BR>One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate
 and 'come to life' (and <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I don't blame them for not participating, I blame myself</SPAN></B>)<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">What Owasp needs now are strong, creative and active leaders who will have to continuously prove </SPAN></B>(i.e. every week, every month, every year) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">that they deserve to be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers projects.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must guarantee and fight for <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join and be (if desired) a non-contributor member)<BR><BR>, is because <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">when Leaders stop behaving accordingly to his/hers responsibilities</SPAN></B> (for personal or professional reasons) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">his/hers replacement
 </SPAN></B>(amicably or not) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">must be an relatively easy and strait-forward process </SPAN></B>(following the wishes of that project's community). <BR><BR>As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp Leader can only be an Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and recognizes his/hers leadership</SPAN></B> (see the Linus example). <BR><BR>In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where the focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as possible) in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">B) My comments on .... Jeff as a OWASP leader</SPAN></B><BR><BR>Before I go any further let me just say that:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in Owasp<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the creation of the Owasp Foundation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -
 I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous when he accepted (from Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff should continue to have some management roles in Owasp <BR><BR>But <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader,</SPAN></B> since I don't think that Jeff has (based on his actions so far) what I would consider to be the right profile to be the main leader that Owasp needs today<BR><BR>Although <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Jeff is beyond doubt a very active and productive Owasp member </SPAN></B>(whose technical competence and professionalism is of the highest caliber)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> I don't think that Jeff</SPAN></B> (to which I sincerely apologize for such a public criticism)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> has the energy, vision and 'craziness' required to lead a project like Owasp (as it is today)</SPAN></B>. Maybe it is Jeff's training as a
 Lawyer that makes him risk-adverse, maybe it is just his personally, and maybe it is just the current phase that Owasp is currently in (<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">there is no reason why Jeff's profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten years time</SPAN></B>).<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">What Owasp needs now is to have an energetic, dynamic, thought provoking and inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into a being major player in the Web Application Security World,</SPAN></B> and help it to make the world a 'safer' (and better) place.<BR><BR>From&nbsp; my point of view,&nbsp; <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">unless Mark retakes the Job</SPAN></B> (which is not an option at the current moment in time), <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I think that Owasp should </SPAN></B>( in the short term) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">NOT HAVE A MAIN LEADER! </SPAN></B><BR><BR>In the short term, <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp should only
 have operational-leaders</SPAN></B> (or whatever they would be called) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">responsible for specific operational tasks </SPAN></B>(for example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the Owasp servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business development exercises, etc...).<BR><BR>Hopefully the <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">crisis created by Mark's departure will create an environment where the new future Owasp Leader will appear, </SPAN></B>and his/her promotion to Owasp leadership is accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and Members.<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Another factor which in my view is not helping the development of Owasp is the fact that <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp is trying to do something that the security industry doesn't want to happen</SPAN></B>. For example:
 <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web Application Security,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the Development of Open Source security tools, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - and ultimately addressing the real problems that are creating the current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'<BR><BR>Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too much money with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in actually solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their markets). <BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The reality is that the ones that have most to benefit from Owasp, are the current 'Security products/services buyers' </SPAN></B>because these are the ones that are currently buying overpriced and incomplete products/solutions. <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The problem is that these 'entities'</SPAN></B> (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs, persons) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">need to
 have something to buy</SPAN></B> (which OWASP currently doesn't have) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">and are used to</SPAN></B> (and demand/expect) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">a credible, professional and reliable service</SPAN></B>.<BR><BR>In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the Security Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) and should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, etc...) which have most to benefit from Owasp work.<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The current Owasp successes</SPAN></B> (like the wide spread usage of the Top 10) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">must be built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and perceived independence is one of Owasp biggest assets</SPAN></B><BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'</SPAN></B><BR><BR>I also find fascinating the fact that <B><SPAN
 style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">the current Owasp-dotNet leader</SPAN></B> (i.e. me)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published</SPAN></B>:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting Environment (SAM'SHE)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Reflector<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Online Metabase explorer<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The only logic explanation </SPAN></B>that I have for this situation (since these tools DO actually work and have helped hundreds of companies to improve their Asp.Net hosting environments) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse' these tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current Full Trust Asp.Net environment is</SPAN></B>.<BR><BR>Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the
 industry, since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a vibrant development community continuously developing and improving these tools. The reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,&nbsp; is because Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies to security issues and&nbsp; shows how low the current level is :-(. <BR><BR>For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) think that they are not doing enough, and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) say that they are making a massive mistake with their current lack of acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net Vulnerabilities;<BR><BR>, based on my professional experience, I still think that <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Microsoft DOES TAKE Security much more Seriously than most other Software companies out there</SPAN></B> (which again shows how we are still very far away from starting to
 tackle the real security problems and vulnerabilities that exist in today's Web Applications).<BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a crazy-open-source-guy which lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to state, that I fully understand that Money and Financial reward is a major element in our current society and way of live. I am not anti-corporations, anti-capitalism or anti-making money.<BR><BR>We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you manage to get paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for it)<BR><BR>I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that position where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do for free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to Owasp, is the fact that a <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">substantial percentage of my
 income for the past 6 months originated in projects directly related to my participation and contributions to Owasp</SPAN></B>.<BR><BR>Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that I received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Thank you Owasp</SPAN></B><BR><BR>In some ways I am a good success-story of how <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp can directly and indirectly provide a good financial and professional reward to active and participative members.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in certain areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp has the opportunity to become a 'recruitment center' for high-skilled, reliable and effective developers</SPAN></B> (since all that the employers would need to do is to look at the prospective employee participation and contribution record)<B><SPAN
 style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR></SPAN></B><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">F) My comments on ... the fact that most Owasp projects have no participation from the community<BR><BR></SPAN></B>In my view there are several <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">reasons why most Owasp Projects don't have more than 2 to 5 active participants</SPAN></B>:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">lack of time: </SPAN></B>Most good and knowledgeable members are currently very busy and have very little time to dedicate to personal projects<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">the current '2h to start being productive' paradigm</SPAN></B>: which means that if I (for example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate at least 2 hours to the project in order to start being productive (sometimes even for simple things like adding content to the new website!). <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">What we need is the</SPAN></B>
 <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">'30m to start being productive' paradigm </SPAN></B>or even better the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when functional, actually create an environment where participants regularly spend 2 hours or more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the ones that don't know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to practice a music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), you must create an environment where there is there is almost no effort required to start practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be able to start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). This means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always be set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow for spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) when the musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which
 usually gets 'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment where it is easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not associated with spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Most Owasp projects don't have clear 'this is want you can do to participate' instructions</SPAN></B> and require quite a lot of work and effort by the would-be contributors and participants<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp memberships is not big enough </SPAN></B>where there are enough people with an 'itch' (i.e. problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's 'itch', which will make them go one step further and spend the time, effort and dedication required to become an active participant and member<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Most projects are very dependent on the availability and energy-level of the project
 leader</SPAN></B> (which usually is also its author / creator). Hopefully we will soon reach a critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?) where the community surrounding a project is vibrant enough to compensate for the regular MIA (Missing in Action) periods<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) and probably the most important one. <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Collaborating in an Open Source project is VERY HARD</SPAN></B>. Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD claims such as 'Open Source projects are created by a network of Kids and clueless programmers' (note that I am a non-violent person and very rarely get angry). Sending a comment like "humm, i clicked on this button and the application crashed" is very easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment like "I installed the application and I had a problem with XYZ function which I traced back to the method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it which solved the problem" or "I've read this 50 page document and here
 are my comments" is :<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code or words)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT MATTER<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in effect sending a criticism of someone else's work)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. "...I think that this is a better way to do it...") which is always a hard thing to do<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that project's leader) PAST BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS <BR><BR>So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of contributions of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open Source projects have as their main contributors highly intelligent, competent, dedicated and creative IT Professionals. <BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>G) My
 comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp Projects<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first person and say that<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> I am as guilty of anybody else for not participating in other Owasp projects. <BR></SPAN></B><BR>I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide, since I have used them professionally.<BR><BR>And the <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">reasons that I have for not participating are:</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I didn't have</SPAN></B> the required <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">time </SPAN></B>to put myself in a position where I was able to send meaningful contributions <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Those<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> project leaders didn't put any pressure on me to participate and didn't actively encourage it</SPAN></B> (when one
 is working on several projects at the same time, unfortunately the projects that don't make any noise and are not critical tend to live permanently on the 'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There is almost <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">no documentation to help</SPAN></B>&nbsp; (although I do admit that I didn't make a huge effort to find it)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">didn't need professionally an improved version of those tools/documents</SPAN></B> (i.e. I didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are scratching)<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">To start contributing in these projects I needed to be given simple, quick and meaningful</SPAN></B> (i.e. could be used in the actual project) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">tasks </SPAN></B>(the '30m task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I should participate. <BR><BR>I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must
 subconsciously feel that my efforts will be appreciated.<BR><BR>I am assuming that If motivated and focused I&nbsp; would produce material of high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although anybody should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no duty to spend any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the appropriate skills, knowledge, attitude or commitment)<BR><BR>And this is the bottom line:<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> it is the leaders of these projects </SPAN></B>(WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test list)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> that have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to participate</SPAN></B>, and if they don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then they should <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) step down (from leaders), <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) become 'normal' project members, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) continue to submit their contributions&nbsp;
 and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another Owasp member that is willing to do it.<BR><BR>Now, <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">does my lack of participation on these projects make me a 'taker'! </SPAN></B>Somebody that is 'exploiting' the work of the talented and dedicated persons who worked on this projects? <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Do I deserve</SPAN></B> (due to my lack of participation) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">to be kicked out of the current mailing lists and not be member of those projects?<BR><BR>H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp<BR><BR></SPAN></B>I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in OWASP today. <BR><BR>It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open Source) that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the Owasp-dotNet efforts.<BR><BR>Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the same ideals and it is always very refreshing
 when one meets other like-minded individuals.<BR><BR>Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to help Owasp in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly responsible for his decision. <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The main reason I am writing this 'Open Letter to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain and Owasp is able to learn from its mistakes and change the current environment which caused one of Owasp most important members to quit.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must have been for him to take this decision. <BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I hope that this 'Open Letter to Owasp' kick-starts a healthy discussion and is well received by the other Owasp Leaders and Members. </SPAN></B><BR><BR>Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out of order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do let me know. <BR><BR>I also
 need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals are not welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit and find (or create) another Community<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I) My comments on ...how Owasp can make money:<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Just before I get into practical solutions (because one cannot only talk, one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where Owasp can make money:<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR><BR></SPAN></B>&nbsp;- Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants <BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Consultancy <BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Accreditations <BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Official Curriculum<BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Books and White papers<BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)<BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)<BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Conferences<BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>And what could this money be used for? <BR><BR>In my view it should be used to pay
 for:</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Owasp Administrative services <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) Owasp Projects<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Creation of Documentation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Packaging of Owasp Products <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Marketing and PR<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sales<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Support to Owasp's product or services <BR><BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">J) Ideas for the Future:<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point Owasp in the right direction:<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR><BR></SPAN></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">In the short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader</SPAN></B>, since this position (which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be earned not given. This means that the next Owasp's leader should be chosen by Owasp's Leaders with full support by Owasp's community<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Jeff should continue to have several responsibilities within Owasp management</SPAN></B>, but current Owasp leaders should be able to say "I would like to take responsibility for 'XYZ' task" <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The current Owasp leaders should do what I recommended earlier and actively encourage their communities to participate in their project.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The current Owasp leaders should also make an effort to participate in each others projects.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A series of 30m tasks should be defined for each project, which will allow the Owasp members to easily contribute and participate</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">On the short term, Owasp must have a CMS </SPAN></B>(Content Management System) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT:
 bold">solution which allows authorized members to QUICKLY (in minutes) and EASILY (not too many clicks) add content to the LIVE SERVER Hosting the main Owasp and individual project's websites.</SPAN></B> I don't care if this is done with the current Magnolia solution, with b-sec's CMS (support.binaryvision.com.au), a very Expensive donated CMS (<A href="http://www.tomoye.com/">www.tomoye.com</A>), with FrontPage, with Dreamweaver or with NOTEPAD!!!! <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">What I want is something that doesn't get in the way, and I can get my content uploaded and published to Owasp website in 10m</SPAN></B>. And (please don't kill me for this), in the beginning I don't really care about how secure this system is. The first objective is to create a dynamic, vibrant and very active community. If we get maliciously hacked, then so be it!!!&nbsp; Note that I am not saying that Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a template) a secure hosting environment. Just to
 avoid confusions let me say it again: <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">"I do think that Owasp should host its online content in an locked down environment which is as secure as possible".</SPAN></B> What I trying to say is that the current priority should be in creating vibrant communities (which could, as one of its projects build a tool to create and configure secure hosting environments)<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">- There must be total clarity of Owasp finances and financial operations</SPAN></B>. The current lack of transparency is not healthy and doesn't promote contributions. I know that there are some short-term credibility issues with the current low-turnover but I strongly believe that the advantages of full openness are far bigger than the disadvantages.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Once the current Owasp finances are published, <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">a short term investment plan should be created which defines what Owasp
 wants to do, how much money it requires, and where is that money going to come from</SPAN></B> (for example I can (through my UK company) make some financial contributions to OWASP)<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A series of 'Owasp Products' should be created</SPAN></B> (based on the current Owasp projects)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> and sold online</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp should take a much more aggressive position in the Industry and start making its Voice heard. </SPAN></B>And if this creates controversy, then so be it (the open letter sent last month was a good start). From my point of view, the moment Owasp starts to be attacked by 'respected' security companies and organizations, is the moment that Owasp is starting to do its job right and is starting to change the world<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A formal Owasp Leader recognition
 process should be created which publicly recognizes current Owasp Leaders</SPAN></B> <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">and most active Project contributors</SPAN></B> (since this will help those person's careers and will encourage others to become leaders them selfs)<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A formal 'Thank you' letter should be sent to Mark</SPAN></B> (signed by as many members as possible) as a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for Owasp<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A meeting should take place to discuss this (and other) ideas</SPAN></B><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR></SPAN></B>I hope that this made sense and if you made it this far, thanks for your patience for reading this long, rambling and of my entire responsibility 'Open Letter to Owasp'<BR><BR>I'm looking forward to your comments<BR><BR>Best regards<BR><BR>Dinis Cruz<BR><BR>PS: My apologies in advance for my spelling and grammatical

Starting to complain that 1) most Owasp members are 'takers' instead of 'givers' and 2) they are only interested in getting from Owasp things for FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in my view: 

    - offensive to those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they are being called: thieves, opportunistic and selfish
    - short-sighted, since there is much more than meets the eye (things are never black or white)
    - counter-productive, since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad feelings amongst the community, and 
    - Missing the point, since the main discussion point should be always about FREEDOM and not about COST

Going further, from my point of view, blaming the current lack of participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of the current Owasp community (which are being labeled as 'takers' and not 'givers') is merely a scapegoat exercise which fails to address the core problems and doesn't allows for the real issue to be dealt with.

In my view, it is not the responsibility and duty of the current Owasp members (for example the persons subscribed to the current mailing lists) to be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of time to those projects.

In my view, IT IS THE SPECIFIC OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT where those project's members (and the other Owasp leaders) fell motivated to participate and become active members. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work, dedication and patience by those project leaders. 

This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: 

    - make everybody aware of what is going on
    - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which can be executed by the community (it should be possible for somebody that wants to contribute to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which will not take him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the current situation))
    - actively market the Owasp project and encourage participation
    - manage expectations and ensure that the project's members are motivated and happy
    - ensure that all contributions are respectively credited and that people are rewarded for their time and commitment
    - create products based on that Project's deliverables (white papers, tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by Owasp

Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project manager experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand statements, specially since  I consider that I (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp leader of the Owasp-dotNet projects) am a very BAD LEADER because I was not able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in the current Owasp-dotNet projects (I am including myself in the guilty-list). I have also been very bad at replying to contributors (sorry specially to Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) and should have done much more to help those subscribers to understand how the tools that I have developed and published work and how they can contribute.

One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate and 'come to life' (and I don't blame them for not participating, I blame myself)

What Owasp needs now are strong, creative and active leaders who will have to continuously prove (i.e. every week, every month, every year) that they deserve to be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers projects.

In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must guarantee and fight for 

    1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and 
    2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join and be (if desired) a non-contributor member)

, is because when Leaders stop behaving accordingly to his/hers responsibilities (for personal or professional reasons) his/hers replacement (amicably or not) must be an relatively easy and strait-forward process (following the wishes of that project's community). 

As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an Owasp Leader can only be an Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and recognizes his/hers leadership (see the Linus example). 

In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where the focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as possible) in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.

B) My comments on .... Jeff as a OWASP leader

Before I go any further let me just say that:

    - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in Owasp
    - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the creation of the Owasp Foundation
    - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous when he accepted (from Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader
    - I think that Jeff should continue to have some management roles in Owasp 

But I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader, since I don't think that Jeff has (based on his actions so far) what I would consider to be the right profile to be the main leader that Owasp needs today

Although Jeff is beyond doubt a very active and productive Owasp member (whose technical competence and professionalism is of the highest caliber) I don't think that Jeff (to which I sincerely apologize for such a public criticism) has the energy, vision and 'craziness' required to lead a project like Owasp (as it is today). Maybe it is Jeff's training as a Lawyer that makes him risk-adverse, maybe it is just his personally, and maybe it is just the current phase that Owasp is currently in (there is no reason why Jeff's profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten years time).

What Owasp needs now is to have an energetic, dynamic, thought provoking and inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into a being major player in the Web Application Security World, and help it to make the world a 'safer' (and better) place.

In the short term, Owasp should only have operational-leaders (or whatever they would be called) responsible for specific operational tasks (for example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the Owasp servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business development exercises, etc...).

Hopefully the crisis created by Mark's departure will create an environment where the new future Owasp Leader will appear, and his/her promotion to Owasp leadership is accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and Members.


C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP

Another factor which in my view is not helping the development of Owasp is the fact that Owasp is trying to do something that the security industry doesn't want to happen. For example: 

    - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web Application Security,
    - the Development of Open Source security tools, 
    - and ultimately addressing the real problems that are creating the current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'

Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too much money with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in actually solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their markets). 

The reality is that the ones that have most to benefit from Owasp, are the current 'Security products/services buyers' because these are the ones that are currently buying overpriced and incomplete products/solutions. The problem is that these 'entities' (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs, persons) need to have something to buy (which OWASP currently doesn't have) and are used to (and demand/expect) a credible, professional and reliable service.

In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the Security Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) and should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, etc...) which have most to benefit from Owasp work.

The current Owasp successes (like the wide spread usage of the Top 10) must be built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and perceived independence is one of Owasp biggest assets


D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'

I also find fascinating the fact that the current Owasp-dotNet leader (i.e. me) has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published:

    - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)
    - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting Environment (SAM'SHE)
    - Asp.Net Reflector
    - Online Metabase explorer

The only logic explanation that I have for this situation (since these tools DO actually work and have helped hundreds of companies to improve their Asp.Net hosting environments) is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse' these tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current Full Trust Asp.Net environment is.

Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the industry, since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a vibrant development community continuously developing and improving these tools. The reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,  is because Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies to security issues and  shows how low the current level is :-(. 

For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): 

    1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), 
    2) think that they are not doing enough, and 
    3) say that they are making a massive mistake with their current lack of acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net Vulnerabilities;

, based on my professional experience, I still think that Microsoft DOES TAKE Security much more Seriously than most other Software companies out there (which again shows how we are still very far away from starting to tackle the real security problems and vulnerabilities that exist in today's Web Applications).

E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp

Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a crazy-open-source-guy which lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to state, that I fully understand that Money and Financial reward is a major element in our current society and way of live. I am not anti-corporations, anti-capitalism or anti-making money.

We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you manage to get paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for it)

I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that position where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do for free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to Owasp, is the fact that a substantial percentage of my income for the past 6 months originated in projects directly related to my participation and contributions to Owasp.

Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that I received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: Thank you Owasp

In some ways I am a good success-story of how Owasp can directly and indirectly provide a good financial and professional reward to active and participative members.

I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in certain areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), Owasp has the opportunity to become a 'recruitment center' for high-skilled, reliable and effective developers (since all that the employers would need to do is to look at the prospective employee participation and contribution record)

F) My comments on ... the fact that most Owasp projects have no participation from the community

In my view there are several reasons why most Owasp Projects don't have more than 2 to 5 active participants:

    1) lack of time: Most good and knowledgeable members are currently very busy and have very little time to dedicate to personal projects

    2) the current '2h to start being productive' paradigm: which means that if I (for example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate at least 2 hours to the project in order to start being productive (sometimes even for simple things like adding content to the new website!). What we need is the '30m to start being productive' paradigm or even better the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when functional, actually create an environment where participants regularly spend 2 hours or more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the ones that don't know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to practice a music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), you must create an environment where there is there is almost no effort required to start practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be able to start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). This means that your musical
 instrument and practice environment must always be set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow for spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) when the musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which usually gets 'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment where it is easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not associated with spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.

    3) Most Owasp projects don't have clear 'this is want you can do to participate' instructions and require quite a lot of work and effort by the would-be contributors and participants

    4) Owasp memberships is not big enough where there are enough people with an 'itch' (i.e. problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's 'itch', which will make them go one step further and spend the time, effort and dedication required to become an active participant and member

    5) Most projects are very dependent on the availability and energy-level of the project leader (which usually is also its author / creator). Hopefully we will soon reach a critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?) where the community surrounding a project is vibrant enough to compensate for the regular MIA (Missing in Action) periods

    6) and probably the most important one. Collaborating in an Open Source project is VERY HARD. Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD claims such as 'Open Source projects are created by a network of Kids and clueless programmers' (note that I am a non-violent person and very rarely get angry). Sending a comment like "humm, i clicked on this button and the application crashed" is very easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment like "I installed the application and I had a problem with XYZ function which I traced back to the method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it which solved the problem" or "I've read this 50 page document and here are my comments" is :

    - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code or words)
    - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT MATTER
    - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, 
    - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in effect sending a criticism of someone else's work)
    - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. "...I think that this is a better way to do it...") which is always a hard thing to do
    - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that project's leader) PAST BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS 

So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of contributions of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open Source projects have as their main contributors highly intelligent, competent, dedicated and creative IT Professionals. 


G) My comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp Projects

Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first person and say that I am as guilty of anybody else for not participating in other Owasp projects. 

I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide, since I have used them professionally.

And the reasons that I have for not participating are:

    -  I didn't have the required time to put myself in a position where I was able to send meaningful contributions 
    - Those project leaders didn't put any pressure on me to participate and didn't actively encourage it (when one is working on several projects at the same time, unfortunately the projects that don't make any noise and are not critical tend to live permanently on the 'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)
    - There is almost no documentation to help  (although I do admit that I didn't make a huge effort to find it)
    - I didn't need professionally an improved version of those tools/documents (i.e. I didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are scratching)

To start contributing in these projects I needed to be given simple, quick and meaningful (i.e. could be used in the actual project) tasks (the '30m task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I should participate. 

I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must subconsciously feel that my efforts will be appreciated.

I am assuming that If motivated and focused I  would produce material of high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although anybody should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no duty to spend any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the appropriate skills, knowledge, attitude or commitment)

And this is the bottom line: it is the leaders of these projects (WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test list) that have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to participate, and if they don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then they should 
    1) step down (from leaders), 
    2) become 'normal' project members, 
    3) continue to submit their contributions  and 
    4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another Owasp member that is willing to do it.

Now, does my lack of participation on these projects make me a 'taker'! Somebody that is 'exploiting' the work of the talented and dedicated persons who worked on this projects? Do I deserve (due to my lack of participation) to be kicked out of the current mailing lists and not be member of those projects?

H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp

I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in OWASP today. 

It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open Source) that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the Owasp-dotNet efforts.

Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the same ideals and it is always very refreshing when one meets other like-minded individuals.

Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to help Owasp in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly responsible for his decision. The main reason I am writing this 'Open Letter to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain and Owasp is able to learn from its mistakes and change the current environment which caused one of Owasp most important members to quit.

Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must have been for him to take this decision. 

I hope that this 'Open Letter to Owasp' kick-starts a healthy discussion and is well received by the other Owasp Leaders and Members. 

Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out of order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do let me know. 

I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals are not welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit and find (or create) another Community

I) My comments on ...how Owasp can make money:

Just before I get into practical solutions (because one cannot only talk, one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where Owasp can make money:

 - Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants 
 - Owasp Consultancy 
 - Owasp Accreditations 
 - Owasp Official Curriculum
 - Owasp Books and White papers
 - Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)
 - Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)
 - Owasp Conferences

And what could this money be used for? 

In my view it should be used to pay for:

    - Owasp Administrative services 
    - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) Owasp Projects
    - Creation of Documentation
    - Packaging of Owasp Products 
    - Marketing and PR
    - Sales
    - Support to Owasp's product or services 


J) Ideas for the Future:

Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point Owasp in the right direction:

     - In the short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader, since this position (which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be earned not given. This means that the next Owasp's leader should be chosen by Owasp's Leaders with full support by Owasp's community

    - Jeff should continue to have several responsibilities within Owasp management, but current Owasp leaders should be able to say "I would like to take responsibility for 'XYZ' task" 

     - The current Owasp leaders should do what I recommended earlier and actively encourage their communities to participate in their project.

     - The current Owasp leaders should also make an effort to participate in each others projects.

    - A series of 30m tasks should be defined for each project, which will allow the Owasp members to easily contribute and participate

    - On the short term, Owasp must have a CMS (Content Management System) solution which allows authorized members to QUICKLY (in minutes) and EASILY (not too many clicks) add content to the LIVE SERVER Hosting the main Owasp and individual project's websites. I don't care if this is done with the current Magnolia solution, with b-sec's CMS (support.binaryvision.com.au), a very Expensive donated CMS (www.tomoye.com), with FrontPage, with Dreamweaver or with NOTEPAD!!!! What I want is something that doesn't get in the way, and I can get my content uploaded and published to Owasp website in 10m. And (please don't kill me for this), in the beginning I don't really care about how secure this system is. The first objective is to create a dynamic, vibrant and very active community. If we get maliciously hacked, then so be it!!!  Note that I am not saying that Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a template) a secure hosting environment. Just to avoid confusions let me say it
 again: "I do think that Owasp should host its online content in an locked down environment which is as secure as possible". What I trying to say is that the current priority should be in creating vibrant communities (which could, as one of its projects build a tool to create and configure secure hosting environments)

    - There must be total clarity of Owasp finances and financial operations. The current lack of transparency is not healthy and doesn't promote contributions. I know that there are some short-term credibility issues with the current low-turnover but I strongly believe that the advantages of full openness are far bigger than the disadvantages.

    - Once the current Owasp finances are published, a short term investment plan should be created which defines what Owasp wants to do, how much money it requires, and where is that money going to come from (for example I can (through my UK company) make some financial contributions to OWASP)

    - A series of 'Owasp Products' should be created (based on the current Owasp projects) and sold online

    - Owasp should take a much more aggressive position in the Industry and start making its Voice heard. And if this creates controversy, then so be it (the open letter sent last month was a good start). From my point of view, the moment Owasp starts to be attacked by 'respected' security companies and organizations, is the moment that Owasp is starting to do its job right and is starting to change the world
   
    - A formal Owasp Leader recognition process should be created which publicly recognizes current Owasp Leaders and most active Project contributors (since this will help those person's careers and will encourage others to become leaders them selfs)

    - A formal 'Thank you' letter should be sent to Mark (signed by as many members as possible) as a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for Owasp

    - A meeting should take place to discuss this (and other) ideas

I hope that this made sense and if you made it this far, thanks for your patience for reading this long, rambling and of my entire responsibility 'Open Letter to Owasp'

I'm looking forward to your comments

Best regards

Dinis Cruz

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Your impassioned open letter is much needed and, hopefully, not too late. &nbsp;I support at least a large part of your thoughts on this subject and am keen to see progress made in much the way you advocate. &nbsp;However, a few observations from my personal POV:<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>

<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I would suggest that the success of Open Source projects is directly related to the nature and motivation of the community they serve. &nbsp;Linux succeeded in large part due to the fact that such a ?product? was immensely useful to its participants, who in large part were geeks who wanted to roll their own ?better? *NIX system. &nbsp;More than intellectually challenging, it provided a product that many individuals could use. &nbsp;However, looking at the OWASP community, I would suggest that the population is more oriented to Enterprises (like my company) and Software Shops. &nbsp;This immediately places a different slant on participants? motivations.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I don?t profess to speak for anyone but myself here, but my openly selfish objectives are two-fold: (a) align my company?s efforts with emerging de facto standards and (b) gain leverage for my seven-figure budget in application security. &nbsp;My preference is to do that with an ?open? standard and not with a vendor and if I can collaborate with my peers in other organizations, that?s even better.&nbsp; However, by the same token, I do not want to squander my hard-won budget on projects that do not deliver within the timeframe I need.&nbsp; Right now, I find it difficult to contribute unless I know that the efforts will bear fruit within reasonable time and that is a basic project management issue: project sponsorship and commitment.&nbsp; I am willing to contribute cash, hosted CMS systems and active staff participation, but I owe it
 to my company and its shareholders that this contribution achieves results. &nbsp;In short, I need guarantees that OWASP will be a force multiplier to my efforts. &nbsp;If you want to take OWASP out of academia and a pure hobbyists? realm, my suggestion is that OWASP needs to recognize these commercial needs.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This appears to me a classic project management issue: most projects fail when there is limited ?skin in the game? (read ?money?) and when project accountability is weak. &nbsp;My advocacy of a strong governance structure is targeted at exactly this issue. &nbsp;Membership funding focuses the mind.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Strong management, well funded, but who are held accountable for deliverables, is one way to approach this. &nbsp;This is the model the FS-ISAC uses and I suggest we need a similar model. That OWASP was born and survived so long is, in my mind, testimony to Mark?s inspirational qualities, but it is not a scalable architecture. &nbsp;True governance is needed to deflect some of my dollars to the project.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="COLOR: navy; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I believe that the best part of the Open Source model ? widespread contributions by motivated individuals and academia, as well as peer review ? need not be lost, so long as there is recognition that the main audience for the products is large organizations. &nbsp;One approach may be a paid membership, with fellowship status being awarded to individuals that have made significant contributions.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></LI></OL>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><B><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=black size=3><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Owasp is in a Crisis!</SPAN></FONT></B><BR><BR>Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of the most active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his reasons for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an environment where the necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) prevents the departure of other key players and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that Mark (and others) will want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.<BR><BR>As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues to be a big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of measures and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end of this 'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my
 personal opinion on several issues which I think are very relevant to the current Owasp environment/situation.<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A) My comments on .... "Owasp's vs Open Source"<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the moment, in the Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source should deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD LIKE to happen.<BR><BR>I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting the concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).<BR><BR>From my point of view, what matters is that the information and source code published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and can be shared and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good inevitable practicality (since if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM would not exist). <BR><BR>Starting to
 <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">complain that 1) most Owasp members are 'takers' instead of 'givers' and 2) they are only interested in getting from Owasp things for FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in my view: </SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">offensive </SPAN></B>to those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they are being called: thieves, opportunistic and selfish<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">short-sighted</SPAN></B>, since there is much more than meets the eye (things are never black or white)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">counter-productive</SPAN></B>, since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad feelings amongst the community, and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Missing the point</SPAN></B>, since the main discussion point should be always about FREEDOM and not about COST<BR><BR>Going further, from my point of view, <B><SPAN
 style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">blaming the current lack of participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of the current Owasp community</SPAN></B> (which are being labeled as 'takers' and not 'givers')<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> is merely a scapegoat exercise which fails to address the core problems and doesn't allows for the real issue to be dealt with.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>In my view, <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">it is not the responsibility and duty of the current Owasp members</SPAN></B> (for example the persons subscribed to the current mailing lists) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">to be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of time to those projects.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>In my view, <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">IT IS THE SPECIFIC OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT where those project's members </SPAN></B>(and the other Owasp leaders)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> fell motivated to participate
 and become active members</SPAN></B>. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work, dedication and patience by those project leaders. <BR><BR>This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - make everybody aware of what is going on<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which can be executed by the community (it should be possible for somebody that wants to contribute to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which will not take him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the current situation))<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - actively market the Owasp project and encourage participation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - manage expectations and ensure that the project's members are motivated and happy<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ensure that all contributions are respectively credited and that people are rewarded for their time and commitment<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create products based on that Project's
 deliverables (white papers, tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by Owasp<BR><BR>Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project manager experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand statements, specially since&nbsp;<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> I consider that I</SPAN></B> (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp leader of the Owasp-dotNet projects) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">am a very BAD LEADER because I was not able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in the current Owasp-dotNet projects</SPAN></B> (I am including myself in the guilty-list). I have also been very bad at replying to contributors (sorry specially to Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) and should have done much more to help those subscribers to understand how the tools that I have developed and published work and how they can contribute.<BR><BR>One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate
 and 'come to life' (and <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I don't blame them for not participating, I blame myself</SPAN></B>)<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">What Owasp needs now are strong, creative and active leaders who will have to continuously prove </SPAN></B>(i.e. every week, every month, every year) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">that they deserve to be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers projects.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must guarantee and fight for <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join and be (if desired) a non-contributor member)<BR><BR>, is because <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">when Leaders stop behaving accordingly to his/hers responsibilities</SPAN></B> (for personal or professional reasons) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">his/hers replacement
 </SPAN></B>(amicably or not) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">must be an relatively easy and strait-forward process </SPAN></B>(following the wishes of that project's community). <BR><BR>As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp Leader can only be an Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and recognizes his/hers leadership</SPAN></B> (see the Linus example). <BR><BR>In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where the focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as possible) in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">B) My comments on .... Jeff as a OWASP leader</SPAN></B><BR><BR>Before I go any further let me just say that:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in Owasp<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the creation of the Owasp Foundation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -
 I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous when he accepted (from Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff should continue to have some management roles in Owasp <BR><BR>But <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader,</SPAN></B> since I don't think that Jeff has (based on his actions so far) what I would consider to be the right profile to be the main leader that Owasp needs today<BR><BR>Although <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Jeff is beyond doubt a very active and productive Owasp member </SPAN></B>(whose technical competence and professionalism is of the highest caliber)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> I don't think that Jeff</SPAN></B> (to which I sincerely apologize for such a public criticism)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> has the energy, vision and 'craziness' required to lead a project like Owasp (as it is today)</SPAN></B>. Maybe it is Jeff's training as a
 Lawyer that makes him risk-adverse, maybe it is just his personally, and maybe it is just the current phase that Owasp is currently in (<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">there is no reason why Jeff's profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten years time</SPAN></B>).<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">What Owasp needs now is to have an energetic, dynamic, thought provoking and inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into a being major player in the Web Application Security World,</SPAN></B> and help it to make the world a 'safer' (and better) place.<BR><BR>From&nbsp; my point of view,&nbsp; <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">unless Mark retakes the Job</SPAN></B> (which is not an option at the current moment in time), <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I think that Owasp should </SPAN></B>( in the short term) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">NOT HAVE A MAIN LEADER! </SPAN></B><BR><BR>In the short term, <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp should only
 have operational-leaders</SPAN></B> (or whatever they would be called) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">responsible for specific operational tasks </SPAN></B>(for example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the Owasp servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business development exercises, etc...).<BR><BR>Hopefully the <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">crisis created by Mark's departure will create an environment where the new future Owasp Leader will appear, </SPAN></B>and his/her promotion to Owasp leadership is accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and Members.<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Another factor which in my view is not helping the development of Owasp is the fact that <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp is trying to do something that the security industry doesn't want to happen</SPAN></B>. For example:
 <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web Application Security,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the Development of Open Source security tools, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - and ultimately addressing the real problems that are creating the current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'<BR><BR>Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too much money with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in actually solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their markets). <BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The reality is that the ones that have most to benefit from Owasp, are the current 'Security products/services buyers' </SPAN></B>because these are the ones that are currently buying overpriced and incomplete products/solutions. <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The problem is that these 'entities'</SPAN></B> (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs, persons) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">need to
 have something to buy</SPAN></B> (which OWASP currently doesn't have) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">and are used to</SPAN></B> (and demand/expect) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">a credible, professional and reliable service</SPAN></B>.<BR><BR>In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the Security Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) and should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, etc...) which have most to benefit from Owasp work.<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The current Owasp successes</SPAN></B> (like the wide spread usage of the Top 10) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">must be built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and perceived independence is one of Owasp biggest assets</SPAN></B><BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'</SPAN></B><BR><BR>I also find fascinating the fact that <B><SPAN
 style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">the current Owasp-dotNet leader</SPAN></B> (i.e. me)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published</SPAN></B>:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting Environment (SAM'SHE)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Reflector<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Online Metabase explorer<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The only logic explanation </SPAN></B>that I have for this situation (since these tools DO actually work and have helped hundreds of companies to improve their Asp.Net hosting environments) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse' these tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current Full Trust Asp.Net environment is</SPAN></B>.<BR><BR>Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the
 industry, since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a vibrant development community continuously developing and improving these tools. The reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,&nbsp; is because Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies to security issues and&nbsp; shows how low the current level is :-(. <BR><BR>For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) think that they are not doing enough, and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) say that they are making a massive mistake with their current lack of acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net Vulnerabilities;<BR><BR>, based on my professional experience, I still think that <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Microsoft DOES TAKE Security much more Seriously than most other Software companies out there</SPAN></B> (which again shows how we are still very far away from starting to
 tackle the real security problems and vulnerabilities that exist in today's Web Applications).<BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a crazy-open-source-guy which lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to state, that I fully understand that Money and Financial reward is a major element in our current society and way of live. I am not anti-corporations, anti-capitalism or anti-making money.<BR><BR>We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you manage to get paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for it)<BR><BR>I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that position where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do for free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to Owasp, is the fact that a <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">substantial percentage of my
 income for the past 6 months originated in projects directly related to my participation and contributions to Owasp</SPAN></B>.<BR><BR>Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that I received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Thank you Owasp</SPAN></B><BR><BR>In some ways I am a good success-story of how <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp can directly and indirectly provide a good financial and professional reward to active and participative members.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in certain areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp has the opportunity to become a 'recruitment center' for high-skilled, reliable and effective developers</SPAN></B> (since all that the employers would need to do is to look at the prospective employee participation and contribution record)<B><SPAN
 style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR></SPAN></B><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">F) My comments on ... the fact that most Owasp projects have no participation from the community<BR><BR></SPAN></B>In my view there are several <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">reasons why most Owasp Projects don't have more than 2 to 5 active participants</SPAN></B>:<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">lack of time: </SPAN></B>Most good and knowledgeable members are currently very busy and have very little time to dedicate to personal projects<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">the current '2h to start being productive' paradigm</SPAN></B>: which means that if I (for example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate at least 2 hours to the project in order to start being productive (sometimes even for simple things like adding content to the new website!). <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">What we need is the</SPAN></B>
 <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">'30m to start being productive' paradigm </SPAN></B>or even better the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when functional, actually create an environment where participants regularly spend 2 hours or more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the ones that don't know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to practice a music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), you must create an environment where there is there is almost no effort required to start practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be able to start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). This means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always be set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow for spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) when the musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which
 usually gets 'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment where it is easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not associated with spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Most Owasp projects don't have clear 'this is want you can do to participate' instructions</SPAN></B> and require quite a lot of work and effort by the would-be contributors and participants<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Owasp memberships is not big enough </SPAN></B>where there are enough people with an 'itch' (i.e. problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's 'itch', which will make them go one step further and spend the time, effort and dedication required to become an active participant and member<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Most projects are very dependent on the availability and energy-level of the project
 leader</SPAN></B> (which usually is also its author / creator). Hopefully we will soon reach a critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?) where the community surrounding a project is vibrant enough to compensate for the regular MIA (Missing in Action) periods<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) and probably the most important one. <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Collaborating in an Open Source project is VERY HARD</SPAN></B>. Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD claims such as 'Open Source projects are created by a network of Kids and clueless programmers' (note that I am a non-violent person and very rarely get angry). Sending a comment like "humm, i clicked on this button and the application crashed" is very easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment like "I installed the application and I had a problem with XYZ function which I traced back to the method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it which solved the problem" or "I've read this 50 page document and here
 are my comments" is :<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code or words)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT MATTER<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in effect sending a criticism of someone else's work)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. "...I think that this is a better way to do it...") which is always a hard thing to do<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that project's leader) PAST BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS <BR><BR>So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of contributions of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open Source projects have as their main contributors highly intelligent, competent, dedicated and creative IT Professionals. <BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>G) My
 comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp Projects<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first person and say that<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> I am as guilty of anybody else for not participating in other Owasp projects. <BR></SPAN></B><BR>I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide, since I have used them professionally.<BR><BR>And the <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">reasons that I have for not participating are:</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I didn't have</SPAN></B> the required <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">time </SPAN></B>to put myself in a position where I was able to send meaningful contributions <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Those<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> project leaders didn't put any pressure on me to participate and didn't actively encourage it</SPAN></B> (when one
 is working on several projects at the same time, unfortunately the projects that don't make any noise and are not critical tend to live permanently on the 'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There is almost <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">no documentation to help</SPAN></B>&nbsp; (although I do admit that I didn't make a huge effort to find it)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">didn't need professionally an improved version of those tools/documents</SPAN></B> (i.e. I didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are scratching)<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">To start contributing in these projects I needed to be given simple, quick and meaningful</SPAN></B> (i.e. could be used in the actual project) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">tasks </SPAN></B>(the '30m task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I should participate. <BR><BR>I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must
 subconsciously feel that my efforts will be appreciated.<BR><BR>I am assuming that If motivated and focused I&nbsp; would produce material of high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although anybody should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no duty to spend any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the appropriate skills, knowledge, attitude or commitment)<BR><BR>And this is the bottom line:<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> it is the leaders of these projects </SPAN></B>(WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test list)<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> that have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to participate</SPAN></B>, and if they don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then they should <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) step down (from leaders), <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) become 'normal' project members, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) continue to submit their contributions&nbsp;
 and <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another Owasp member that is willing to do it.<BR><BR>Now, <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">does my lack of participation on these projects make me a 'taker'! </SPAN></B>Somebody that is 'exploiting' the work of the talented and dedicated persons who worked on this projects? <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Do I deserve</SPAN></B> (due to my lack of participation) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">to be kicked out of the current mailing lists and not be member of those projects?<BR><BR>H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp<BR><BR></SPAN></B>I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in OWASP today. <BR><BR>It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open Source) that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the Owasp-dotNet efforts.<BR><BR>Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the same ideals and it is always very refreshing
 when one meets other like-minded individuals.<BR><BR>Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to help Owasp in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly responsible for his decision. <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The main reason I am writing this 'Open Letter to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain and Owasp is able to learn from its mistakes and change the current environment which caused one of Owasp most important members to quit.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must have been for him to take this decision. <BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I hope that this 'Open Letter to Owasp' kick-starts a healthy discussion and is well received by the other Owasp Leaders and Members. </SPAN></B><BR><BR>Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out of order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do let me know. <BR><BR>I also
 need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals are not welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit and find (or create) another Community<BR><BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">I) My comments on ...how Owasp can make money:<BR><BR></SPAN></B>Just before I get into practical solutions (because one cannot only talk, one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where Owasp can make money:<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR><BR></SPAN></B>&nbsp;- Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants <BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Consultancy <BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Accreditations <BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Official Curriculum<BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Books and White papers<BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)<BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)<BR>&nbsp;- Owasp Conferences<BR><B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR>And what could this money be used for? <BR><BR>In my view it should be used to pay

 - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Jeff should continue to have several responsibilities within Owasp management</SPAN></B>, but current Owasp leaders should be able to say "I would like to take responsibility for 'XYZ' task" <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The current Owasp leaders should do what I recommended earlier and actively encourage their communities to participate in their project.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The current Owasp leaders should also make an effort to participate in each others projects.</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A series of 30m tasks should be defined for each project, which will allow the Owasp members to easily contribute and participate</SPAN></B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">On the short term, Owasp must have a CMS </SPAN></B>(Content Management System) <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT:

If we get maliciously hacked, then so be it!!!&nbsp; Note that I am not saying that Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a template) a secure hosting environment. Just to
 avoid confusions let me say it again: <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">"I do think that Owasp should host its online content in an locked down environment which is as secure as possible".</SPAN></B> What I trying to say is that the current priority should be in creating vibrant communities (which could, as one of its projects build a tool to create and configure secure hosting environments)<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">- There must be total clarity of Owasp finances and financial operations</SPAN></B>.

published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and can be
shared and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is FREE (as
in beer, i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good inevitable
practicality (since if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM would
not exist). 

Starting to complain that 1) most Owasp members are 'takers' instead of
'givers' and 2) they are only interested in getting from Owasp things for
FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in my view: 

    - offensive to those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they
are being called: thieves, opportunistic and selfish
    - short-sighted, since there is much more than meets the eye (things are
never black or white)
    - counter-productive, since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad
feelings amongst the community, and 
    - Missing the point, since the main discussion point should be always
about FREEDOM and not about COST

Going further, from my point of view, blaming the current lack of
participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of the current Owasp
community (which are being labeled as 'takers' and not 'givers') is merely a
scapegoat exercise which fails to address the core problems and doesn't
allows for the real issue to be dealt with.

In my view, it is not the responsibility and duty of the current Owasp
members (for example the persons subscribed to the current mailing lists) to
be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of time to those
projects.

In my view, IT IS THE SPECIFIC OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS THE
RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT where those project's
members (and the other Owasp leaders) fell motivated to participate and
become active members. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work,
dedication and patience by those project leaders. 

This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: 

    - make everybody aware of what is going on
    - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which can be executed by
the community (it should be possible for somebody that wants to contribute
to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which will not take
him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the current
situation))
    - actively market the Owasp project and encourage participation
    - manage expectations and ensure that the project's members are
motivated and happy
    - ensure that all contributions are respectively credited and that
people are rewarded for their time and commitment
    - create products based on that Project's deliverables (white papers,
tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by Owasp

Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project manager
experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand
statements, specially since  I consider that I (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp
leader of the Owasp-dotNet projects) am a very BAD LEADER because I was not
able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in the
current Owasp-dotNet projects (I am including myself in the guilty-list). I
have also been very bad at replying to contributors (sorry specially to
Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) and should have
done much more to help those subscribers to understand how the tools that I
have developed and published work and how they can contribute.

One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate and
'come to life' (and I don't blame them for not participating, I blame
myself)

What Owasp needs now are strong, creative and active leaders who will have
to continuously prove (i.e. every week, every month, every year) that they
deserve to be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers
projects.

In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must guarantee
and fight for 

    1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and 
    2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join and be (if desired)
a non-contributor member)

, is because when Leaders stop behaving accordingly to his/hers
responsibilities (for personal or professional reasons) his/hers replacement
(amicably or not) must be an relatively easy and strait-forward process
(following the wishes of that project's community). 

As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an Owasp Leader can only be an
Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and recognizes his/hers
leadership (see the Linus example). 

In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where the
focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as
possible) in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.

B) My comments on .... Jeff as a OWASP leader

Before I go any further let me just say that:

    - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in Owasp
    - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the creation of the Owasp
Foundation
    - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous when he accepted (from
Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader
    - I think that Jeff should continue to have some management roles in
Owasp 

But I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader,
since I don't think that Jeff has (based on his actions so far) what I would
consider to be the right profile to be the main leader that Owasp needs
today

Although Jeff is beyond doubt a very active and productive Owasp member
(whose technical competence and professionalism is of the highest caliber) I
don't think that Jeff (to which I sincerely apologize for such a public
criticism) has the energy, vision and 'craziness' required to lead a project
like Owasp (as it is today). Maybe it is Jeff's training as a Lawyer that
makes him risk-adverse, maybe it is just his personally, and maybe it is
just the current phase that Owasp is currently in (there is no reason why
Jeff's profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten
years time).

What Owasp needs now is to have an energetic, dynamic, thought provoking and
inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into a being major player in the Web
Application Security World, and help it to make the world a 'safer' (and
better) place.

at the current moment in time), I think that Owasp should ( in the short
term) NOT HAVE A MAIN LEADER! 

In the short term, Owasp should only have operational-leaders (or whatever
they would be called) responsible for specific operational tasks (for
example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the Owasp
servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business
development exercises, etc...).

Hopefully the crisis created by Mark's departure will create an environment
where the new future Owasp Leader will appear, and his/her promotion to
Owasp leadership is accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and
Members.


C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP

Another factor which in my view is not helping the development of Owasp is
the fact that Owasp is trying to do something that the security industry
doesn't want to happen. For example: 

    - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web Application
Security,
    - the Development of Open Source security tools, 
    - and ultimately addressing the real problems that are creating the
current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'

Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too much
money with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in
actually solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their
markets). 

The reality is that the ones that have most to benefit from Owasp, are the
current 'Security products/services buyers' because these are the ones that
are currently buying overpriced and incomplete products/solutions. The
problem is that these 'entities' (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs,
persons) need to have something to buy (which OWASP currently doesn't have)
and are used to (and demand/expect) a credible, professional and reliable
service.

In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the Security
Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) and
should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, etc...)
which have most to benefit from Owasp work.

The current Owasp successes (like the wide spread usage of the Top 10) must
be built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and
perceived independence is one of Owasp biggest assets


D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'

I also find fascinating the fact that the current Owasp-dotNet leader (i.e.
me) has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team
regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published:

    - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)
    - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting Environment (SAM'SHE)
    - Asp.Net Reflector
    - Online Metabase explorer

The only logic explanation that I have for this situation (since these tools
DO actually work and have helped hundreds of companies to improve their
Asp.Net hosting environments) is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse'
these tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current
Full Trust Asp.Net environment is.

Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the industry,
since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a vibrant
development community continuously developing and improving these tools. The
reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,  is because
Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies to
security issues and  shows how low the current level is :-(. 

For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): 

    1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), 
    2) think that they are not doing enough, and 
    3) say that they are making a massive mistake with their current lack of
acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net Vulnerabilities;

, based on my professional experience, I still think that Microsoft DOES
TAKE Security much more Seriously than most other Software companies out
there (which again shows how we are still very far away from starting to
tackle the real security problems and vulnerabilities that exist in today's
Web Applications).

E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp

Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a crazy-open-source-guy which
lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to state, that I fully understand
that Money and Financial reward is a major element in our current society
and way of live. I am not anti-corporations, anti-capitalism or anti-making
money.

We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you manage to
get paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for
it)

I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that position
where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do for
free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to Owasp,
is the fact that a substantial percentage of my income for the past 6 months
originated in projects directly related to my participation and
contributions to Owasp.

Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that I
received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: Thank
you Owasp

In some ways I am a good success-story of how Owasp can directly and
indirectly provide a good financial and professional reward to active and
participative members.

I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in certain
areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), Owasp has the
opportunity to become a 'recruitment center' for high-skilled, reliable and
effective developers (since all that the employers would need to do is to
look at the prospective employee participation and contribution record)

F) My comments on ... the fact that most Owasp projects have no
participation from the community

In my view there are several reasons why most Owasp Projects don't have more
than 2 to 5 active participants:

    1) lack of time: Most good and knowledgeable members are currently very
busy and have very little time to dedicate to personal projects

    2) the current '2h to start being productive' paradigm: which means that
if I (for example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate
at least 2 hours to the project in order to start being productive
(sometimes even for simple things like adding content to the new website!).
What we need is the '30m to start being productive' paradigm or even better
the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when functional,
actually create an environment where participants regularly spend 2 hours or
more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the ones that don't
know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to practice a
music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), you must create
an environment where there is there is almost no effort required to start
practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be able to
start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). This
means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always be
set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow for
spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) when
the musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which usually
gets 'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment
where it is easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not
associated with spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.

    3) Most Owasp projects don't have clear 'this is want you can do to
participate' instructions and require quite a lot of work and effort by the
would-be contributors and participants

    4) Owasp memberships is not big enough where there are enough people
with an 'itch' (i.e. problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's
'itch', which will make them go one step further and spend the time, effort
and dedication required to become an active participant and member

    5) Most projects are very dependent on the availability and energy-level
of the project leader (which usually is also its author / creator).
Hopefully we will soon reach a critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?)
where the community surrounding a project is vibrant enough to compensate
for the regular MIA (Missing in Action) periods

    6) and probably the most important one. Collaborating in an Open Source
project is VERY HARD. Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD
claims such as 'Open Source projects are created by a network of Kids and
clueless programmers' (note that I am a non-violent person and very rarely
get angry). Sending a comment like "humm, i clicked on this button and the
application crashed" is very easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment
like "I installed the application and I had a problem with XYZ function
which I traced back to the method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it
which solved the problem" or "I've read this 50 page document and here are
my comments" is :

    - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code or words)
    - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT
MATTER
    - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, 
    - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in effect sending a
criticism of someone else's work)
    - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. "...I think that this
is a better way to do it...") which is always a hard thing to do
    - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that project's leader) PAST
BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS 

So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of
contributions of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open
Source projects have as their main contributors highly intelligent,
competent, dedicated and creative IT Professionals. 


G) My comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp Projects

Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first person and say
that I am as guilty of anybody else for not participating in other Owasp
projects. 

I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat,
WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide, since
I have used them professionally.

And the reasons that I have for not participating are:

    -  I didn't have the required time to put myself in a position where I
was able to send meaningful contributions 
    - Those project leaders didn't put any pressure on me to participate and
didn't actively encourage it (when one is working on several projects at the
same time, unfortunately the projects that don't make any noise and are not
critical tend to live permanently on the
'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)
    - There is almost no documentation to help  (although I do admit that I
didn't make a huge effort to find it)
    - I didn't need professionally an improved version of those
tools/documents (i.e. I didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are
scratching)

To start contributing in these projects I needed to be given simple, quick
and meaningful (i.e. could be used in the actual project) tasks (the '30m
task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I should
participate. 

I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must
subconsciously feel that my efforts will be appreciated.

I am assuming that If motivated and focused I  would produce material of
high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although
anybody should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no
duty to spend any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the
appropriate skills, knowledge, attitude or commitment)

And this is the bottom line: it is the leaders of these projects (WebGoat,
WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test list) that
have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to participate, and if they
don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then they should 
    1) step down (from leaders), 
    2) become 'normal' project members, 
    3) continue to submit their contributions  and 
    4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another Owasp member that is
willing to do it.

Now, does my lack of participation on these projects make me a 'taker'!
Somebody that is 'exploiting' the work of the talented and dedicated persons
who worked on this projects? Do I deserve (due to my lack of participation)
to be kicked out of the current mailing lists and not be member of those
projects?

H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp

I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in OWASP today. 

It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open Source)
that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the
Owasp-dotNet efforts.

Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the same
ideals and it is always very refreshing when one meets other like-minded
individuals.

Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to help
Owasp in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly
responsible for his decision. The main reason I am writing this 'Open Letter
to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain and Owasp is able to
learn from its mistakes and change the current environment which caused one
of Owasp most important members to quit.

Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must have
been for him to take this decision. 

I hope that this 'Open Letter to Owasp' kick-starts a healthy discussion and
is well received by the other Owasp Leaders and Members. 

Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out of
order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do let
me know. 

I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals are not
welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit and
find (or create) another Community

I) My comments on ...how Owasp can make money:

Just before I get into practical solutions (because one cannot only talk,
one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where Owasp can
make money:

 - Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants 
 - Owasp Consultancy 
 - Owasp Accreditations 
 - Owasp Official Curriculum
 - Owasp Books and White papers
 - Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)
 - Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)
 - Owasp Conferences

And what could this money be used for? 

In my view it should be used to pay for:

    - Owasp Administrative services 
    - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) Owasp Projects
    - Creation of Documentation
    - Packaging of Owasp Products 
    - Marketing and PR
    - Sales
    - Support to Owasp's product or services 


J) Ideas for the Future:

Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point Owasp in the right
direction:

     - In the short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader, since this
position (which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be earned
not given. This means that the next Owasp's leader should be chosen by
Owasp's Leaders with full support by Owasp's community

    - Jeff should continue to have several responsibilities within Owasp
management, but current Owasp leaders should be able to say "I would like to
take responsibility for 'XYZ' task" 

     - The current Owasp leaders should do what I recommended earlier and
actively encourage their communities to participate in their project.

     - The current Owasp leaders should also make an effort to participate
in each others projects.

    - A series of 30m tasks should be defined for each project, which will
allow the Owasp members to easily contribute and participate

    - On the short term, Owasp must have a CMS (Content Management System)
solution which allows authorized members to QUICKLY (in minutes) and EASILY
(not too many clicks) add content to the LIVE SERVER Hosting the main Owasp
and individual project's websites. I don't care if this is done with the
current Magnolia solution, with b-sec's CMS (support.binaryvision.com.au), a
very Expensive donated CMS (www.tomoye.com), with FrontPage, with
Dreamweaver or with NOTEPAD!!!! What I want is something that doesn't get in
the way, and I can get my content uploaded and published to Owasp website in
10m. And (please don't kill me for this), in the beginning I don't really
care about how secure this system is. The first objective is to create a
dynamic, vibrant and very active community. If we get maliciously hacked,
then so be it!!!  Note that I am not saying that Owasp should not have (and
be able to provide as a template) a secure hosting environment. Just to
avoid confusions let me say it again: "I do think that Owasp should host its
online content in an locked down environment which is as secure as
possible". What I trying to say is that the current priority should be in
creating vibrant communities (which could, as one of its projects build a
tool to create and configure secure hosting environments)

    - There must be total clarity of Owasp finances and financial
operations. The current lack of transparency is not healthy and doesn't
promote contributions. I know that there are some short-term credibility
issues with the current low-turnover but I strongly believe that the
advantages of full openness are far bigger than the disadvantages.

    - Once the current Owasp finances are published, a short term investment
plan should be created which defines what Owasp wants to do, how much money
it requires, and where is that money going to come from (for example I can
(through my UK company) make some financial contributions to OWASP)

    - A series of 'Owasp Products' should be created (based on the current
Owasp projects) and sold online

    - Owasp should take a much more aggressive position in the Industry and
start making its Voice heard. And if this creates controversy, then so be it
(the open letter sent last month was a good start). From my point of view,
the moment Owasp starts to be attacked by 'respected' security companies and
organizations, is the moment that Owasp is starting to do its job right and
is starting to change the world
   
    - A formal Owasp Leader recognition process should be created which
publicly recognizes current Owasp Leaders and most active Project
contributors (since this will help those person's careers and will encourage
others to become leaders them selfs)

    - A formal 'Thank you' letter should be sent to Mark (signed by as many
members as possible) as a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for
Owasp

    - A meeting should take place to discuss this (and other) ideas

I hope that this made sense and if you made it this far, thanks for your
patience for reading this long, rambling and of my entire responsibility
'Open Letter to Owasp'

I'm looking forward to your comments

Best regards

Dinis Cruz

in a Crisis!</span></font></b><br>
<br>
Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of =
the most
active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his =
reasons
for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an environment =
where the
necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) prevents the departure of other key players and =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that Mark =
(and
others) will want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.<br>
<br>
As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues to =
be a
big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of =
measures
and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end of =
this
'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my personal =
opinion on
several issues which I think are very relevant to the current Owasp
environment/situation.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>A) My comments on .... &quot;Owasp's =
vs Open
Source&quot;<br>
<br>
</span></b>Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the =
moment, in
the Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source =
should
deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD =
LIKE to
happen.<br>
<br>
I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting =
the
concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).<br>

code
published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and can be =
shared
and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is FREE (as in =
beer,
i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good inevitable practicality =
(since
if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM would not exist). <br>
<br>
Starting to <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>complain that 1) most =
Owasp
members are 'takers' instead of 'givers' and 2) they are only interested =
in
getting from Owasp things for FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in my =
view: </span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>offensive =
</span></b>to
those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they are being =
called:
thieves, opportunistic and selfish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>short-sighted</span></b>,
since there is much more than meets the eye (things are never black or =
white)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>counter-productive</span></b>,
since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad feelings amongst the
community, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Missing the =
point</span></b>,
since the main discussion point should be always about FREEDOM and not =
about
COST<br>
<br>
Going further, from my point of view, <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>blaming
the current lack of participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of =
the
current Owasp community</span></b> (which are being labeled as 'takers' =
and not
'givers')<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> is merely a scapegoat =
exercise
which fails to address the core problems and doesn't allows for the real =
issue
to be dealt with.</span></b><br>
<br>
In my view, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>it is not the =
responsibility and
duty of the current Owasp members</span></b> (for example the persons
subscribed to the current mailing lists) <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>to
be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of time to those
projects.</span></b><br>
<br>
In my view, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>IT IS THE SPECIFIC OWASP =
PROJECT
LEADER THAT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT =
where
those project's members </span></b>(and the other Owasp leaders)<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'> fell motivated to participate and become =
active
members</span></b>. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work, =
dedication
and patience by those project leaders. <br>
<br>
This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - make everybody aware of what is going on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which =
can be
executed by the community (it should be possible for somebody that wants =
to
contribute to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which will =
not
take him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the current
situation))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - actively market the Owasp project and encourage
participation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - manage expectations and ensure that the project's =
members
are motivated and happy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ensure that all contributions are respectively =
credited
and that people are rewarded for their time and commitment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create products based on that Project's =
deliverables
(white papers, tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by =
Owasp<br>
<br>
Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project =
manager
experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand
statements, specially since&nbsp;<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I =
consider
that I</span></b> (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp leader of the Owasp-dotNet
projects) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>am a very BAD LEADER =
because I was
not able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in =
the
current Owasp-dotNet projects</span></b> (I am including myself in the
guilty-list). I have also been very bad at replying to contributors =
(sorry
specially to Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) =
and
should have done much more to help those subscribers to understand how =
the
tools that I have developed and published work and how they can =
contribute.<br>
<br>
One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate and =
'come
to life' (and <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I don't blame them for =
not
participating, I blame myself</span></b>)<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What Owasp needs now are strong, =
creative and
active leaders who will have to continuously prove </span></b>(i.e. =
every week,
every month, every year) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>that they =
deserve to
be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers =
projects.</span></b><br>
<br>
In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must =
guarantee and
fight for <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join =
and be
(if desired) a non-contributor member)<br>
<br>
, is because <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>when Leaders stop =
behaving
accordingly to his/hers responsibilities</span></b> (for personal or
professional reasons) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>his/hers =
replacement </span></b>(amicably
or not) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>must be an relatively easy =
and
strait-forward process </span></b>(following the wishes of that =
project's
community). <br>
<br>
As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp
Leader can only be an Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and
recognizes his/hers leadership</span></b> (see the Linus example). <br>
<br>
In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where =
the
focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as =
possible)
in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>B) My comments on .... Jeff as a =
OWASP leader</span></b><br>
<br>
Before I go any further let me just say that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in =
Owasp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the =
creation
of the Owasp Foundation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous =
when he accepted
(from Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff should continue to have some =
management
roles in Owasp <br>
<br>
But <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD =
CONTINUE
TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader,</span></b> since I don't think that Jeff =
has
(based on his actions so far) what I would consider to be the right =
profile to
be the main leader that Owasp needs today<br>
<br>
Although <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Jeff is beyond doubt a very =
active
and productive Owasp member </span></b>(whose technical competence and
professionalism is of the highest caliber)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I
don't think that Jeff</span></b> (to which I sincerely apologize for =
such a
public criticism)<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> has the energy, =
vision and
'craziness' required to lead a project like Owasp (as it is =
today)</span></b>.
Maybe it is Jeff's training as a Lawyer that makes him risk-adverse, =
maybe it
is just his personally, and maybe it is just the current phase that =
Owasp is
currently in (<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>there is no reason why =
Jeff's
profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten years =
time</span></b>).<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What Owasp needs now is to have an =
energetic,
dynamic, thought provoking and inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into =
a being
major player in the Web Application Security World,</span></b> and help =
it to
make the world a 'safer' (and better) place.<br>
<br>
From&nbsp; my point of view,&nbsp; <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>unless
Mark retakes the Job</span></b> (which is not an option at the current =
moment
in time), <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I think that Owasp should =
</span></b>(
in the short term) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>NOT HAVE A MAIN =
LEADER! </span></b><br>
<br>
In the short term, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp should only =
have
operational-leaders</span></b> (or whatever they would be called) =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>responsible for specific operational tasks =
</span></b>(for
example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the =
Owasp
servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business
development exercises, etc...).<br>
<br>
Hopefully the <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>crisis created by =
Mark's
departure will create an environment where the new future Owasp Leader =
will
appear, </span></b>and his/her promotion to Owasp leadership is
accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and Members.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP<br>
<br>
</span></b>Another factor which in my view is not helping the =
development of
Owasp is the fact that <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp is =
trying to do
something that the security industry doesn't want to happen</span></b>. =
For
example: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web
Application Security,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the Development of Open Source security tools, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - and ultimately addressing the real problems that =
are
creating the current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'<br>
<br>
Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too much =
money
with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in =
actually
solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their =
markets). <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The reality is that the ones that =
have most
to benefit from Owasp, are the current 'Security products/services =
buyers' </span></b>because
these are the ones that are currently buying overpriced and incomplete
products/solutions. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The problem is =
that these
'entities'</span></b> (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs, =
persons) <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>need to have something to buy</span></b> =
(which OWASP
currently doesn't have) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>and are used =
to</span></b>
(and demand/expect) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>a credible, =
professional
and reliable service</span></b>.<br>
<br>
In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the =
Security
Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) =
and
should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, etc...) =
which
have most to benefit from Owasp work.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The current Owasp =
successes</span></b> (like
the wide spread usage of the Top 10) <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>must be
built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and =
perceived
independence is one of Owasp biggest assets</span></b><br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'</span></b><br>
<br>
I also find fascinating the fact that <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>the
current Owasp-dotNet leader</span></b> (i.e. me)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:
bold'> has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team
regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published</span></b>:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting
Environment (SAM'SHE)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Reflector<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Online Metabase explorer<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The only logic explanation =
</span></b>that I
have for this situation (since these tools DO actually work and have =
helped
hundreds of companies to improve their Asp.Net hosting environments) =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse' =
these
tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current =
Full
Trust Asp.Net environment is</span></b>.<br>
<br>
Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the =
industry,
since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a vibrant
development community continuously developing and improving these tools. =
The
reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,&nbsp; is because
Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies =
to
security issues and&nbsp; shows how low the current level is :-(. <br>
<br>
For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) think that they are not doing enough, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) say that they are making a massive mistake with =
their
current lack of acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net
Vulnerabilities;<br>
<br>
, based on my professional experience, I still think that <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Microsoft DOES TAKE Security much more =
Seriously than
most other Software companies out there</span></b> (which again shows =
how we
are still very far away from starting to tackle the real security =
problems and
vulnerabilities that exist in today's Web Applications).<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp<br>
<br>
</span></b>Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a
crazy-open-source-guy which lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to =
state,
that I fully understand that Money and Financial reward is a major =
element in
our current society and way of live. I am not anti-corporations,
anti-capitalism or anti-making money.<br>
<br>
We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you manage =
to get
paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for =
it)<br>
<br>
I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that =
position
where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do =
for
free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to =
Owasp, is
the fact that a <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>substantial =
percentage of my
income for the past 6 months originated in projects directly related to =
my
participation and contributions to Owasp</span></b>.<br>
<br>
Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that =
I
received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Thank you Owasp</span></b><br>
<br>
In some ways I am a good success-story of how <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp
can directly and indirectly provide a good financial and professional =
reward to
active and participative members.</span></b><br>
<br>
I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in =
certain
areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp has the opportunity to become a =
'recruitment
center' for high-skilled, reliable and effective developers</span></b> =
(since
all that the employers would need to do is to look at the prospective =
employee
participation and contribution record)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
</span></b><br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>F) My comments on ... the fact that =
most
Owasp projects have no participation from the community<br>
<br>
</span></b>In my view there are several <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>reasons
why most Owasp Projects don't have more than 2 to 5 active =
participants</span></b>:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>lack of time: =
</span></b>Most
good and knowledgeable members are currently very busy and have very =
little
time to dedicate to personal projects<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>the current =
'2h to
start being productive' paradigm</span></b>: which means that if I (for
example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate at =
least 2
hours to the project in order to start being productive (sometimes even =
for
simple things like adding content to the new website!). <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What we need is the</span></b> <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>'30m to start being productive' paradigm =
</span></b>or
even better the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when
functional, actually create an environment where participants regularly =
spend 2
hours or more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the =
ones that
don't know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to
practice a music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), =
you
must create an environment where there is there is almost no effort =
required to
start practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be =
able to
start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). =
This
means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always =
be
set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow for
spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) =
when the
musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which usually =
gets
'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment =
where it is
easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not =
associated with
spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Most Owasp =
projects
don't have clear 'this is want you can do to participate' =
instructions</span></b>
and require quite a lot of work and effort by the would-be contributors =
and
participants<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp =
memberships is
not big enough </span></b>where there are enough people with an 'itch' =
(i.e.
problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's 'itch', which =
will make
them go one step further and spend the time, effort and dedication =
required to
become an active participant and member<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Most projects =
are very
dependent on the availability and energy-level of the project =
leader</span></b>
(which usually is also its author / creator). Hopefully we will soon =
reach a
critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?) where the community =
surrounding a
project is vibrant enough to compensate for the regular MIA (Missing in =
Action)
periods<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) and probably the most important one. <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Collaborating in an Open Source project is =
VERY HARD</span></b>.
Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD claims such as 'Open =
Source
projects are created by a network of Kids and clueless programmers' =
(note that
I am a non-violent person and very rarely get angry). Sending a comment =
like
&quot;humm, i clicked on this button and the application crashed&quot; =
is very
easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment like &quot;I installed the
application and I had a problem with XYZ function which I traced back to =
the
method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it which solved the =
problem&quot;
or &quot;I've read this 50 page document and here are my comments&quot; =
is :<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code =
or
words)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR
TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT MATTER<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in =
effect
sending a criticism of someone else's work)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. =
&quot;...I
think that this is a better way to do it...&quot;) which is always a =
hard thing
to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that =
project's
leader) PAST BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS <br>
<br>
So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of =
contributions
of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open Source =
projects have
as their main contributors highly intelligent, competent, dedicated and
creative IT Professionals. <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
G) My comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp =
Projects<br>
<br>
</span></b>Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first =
person
and say that<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I am as guilty of =
anybody else
for not participating in other Owasp projects. <br>
</span></b><br>
I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat, =

used
them professionally.<br>
<br>
And the <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>reasons that I have for not

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I didn't =

the
projects that don't make any noise and are not critical tend to live
permanently on the 'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - There is almost <b><span =

H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp<br>
<br>
</span></b>I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in =
OWASP
today. <br>
<br>
It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open =
Source)
that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the
Owasp-dotNet efforts.<br>
<br>
Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the same =
ideals
and it is always very refreshing when one meets other like-minded =
individuals.<br>
<br>
Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to help =
Owasp
in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly =
responsible for
his decision. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The main reason I am =
writing
this 'Open Letter to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain =
and
Owasp is able to learn from its mistakes and change the current =
environment
which caused one of Owasp most important members to quit.</span></b><br>
<br>
Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must =
have been
for him to take this decision. <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I hope that this 'Open Letter to =
Owasp'
kick-starts a healthy discussion and is well received by the other Owasp
Leaders and Members. </span></b><br>
<br>
Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out =
of
order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do =
let me
know. <br>
<br>
I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals are =
not
welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit =
and find
(or create) another Community<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I) My comments on ...how Owasp can =
make
money:<br>
<br>
</span></b>Just before I get into practical solutions (because one =
cannot only
talk, one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where =
Owasp can
make money:<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
<br>
</span></b>&nbsp;- Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Consultancy <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Accreditations <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Official Curriculum<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Books and White papers<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Conferences<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
And what could this money be used for? <br>
<br>
In my view it should be used to pay for:</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Owasp Administrative services <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) =
Owasp
Projects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Creation of Documentation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Packaging of Owasp Products <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Marketing and PR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sales<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Support to Owasp's product or services <br>
<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>J) Ideas for the Future:<br>
<br>
</span></b>Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point Owasp =
in the
right direction:<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
<br>
</span></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>In the
short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader</span></b>, since this
position (which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be =
earned not
given. This means that the next Owasp's leader should be chosen by =
Owasp's
Leaders with full support by Owasp's community<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Jeff should =
continue to
have several responsibilities within Owasp management</span></b>, but =
current
Owasp leaders should be able to say &quot;I would like to take =
responsibility

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The =
current Owasp
leaders should do what I recommended earlier and actively encourage =
their
communities to participate in their project.</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The =
current Owasp

projects.</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>A series of 30m =
tasks
should be defined for each project, which will allow the Owasp members =
to
easily contribute and participate</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>On the short =
term, Owasp

that Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a template) a =

<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>&quot;I do think that Owasp should host its =

possible&quot;.</span></b>
What I trying to say is that the current priority should be in creating =

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>- There must be =

Date: Wed, 01 Nov 2006 18:36:00 -0000
Subject: No subject
Message-ID: <mailman.28.1162406181.13353.owasp-testing@lists.owasp.org>

published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and can be
shared and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is FREE (as
in beer, i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good inevitable
practicality (since if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM would
not exist). 

Starting to complain that 1) most Owasp members are 'takers' instead of
'givers' and 2) they are only interested in getting from Owasp things for
FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in my view: 

    - offensive to those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they
are being called: thieves, opportunistic and selfish
    - short-sighted, since there is much more than meets the eye (things are
never black or white)
    - counter-productive, since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad
feelings amongst the community, and 
    - Missing the point, since the main discussion point should be always
about FREEDOM and not about COST

Going further, from my point of view, blaming the current lack of
participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of the current Owasp
community (which are being labeled as 'takers' and not 'givers') is merely a
scapegoat exercise which fails to address the core problems and doesn't
allows for the real issue to be dealt with.

In my view, it is not the responsibility and duty of the current Owasp
members (for example the persons subscribed to the current mailing lists) to
be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of time to those
projects.

In my view, IT IS THE SPECIFIC OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS THE
RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT where those project's
members (and the other Owasp leaders) fell motivated to participate and
become active members. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work,
dedication and patience by those project leaders. 

This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: 

    - make everybody aware of what is going on
    - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks which can be executed by
the community (it should be possible for somebody that wants to contribute
to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which will not take
him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the current
situation))
    - actively market the Owasp project and encourage participation
    - manage expectations and ensure that the project's members are
motivated and happy
    - ensure that all contributions are respectively credited and that
people are rewarded for their time and commitment
    - create products based on that Project's deliverables (white papers,
tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by Owasp

Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project manager
experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand
statements, specially since  I consider that I (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp
leader of the Owasp-dotNet projects) am a very BAD LEADER because I was not
able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate in the
current Owasp-dotNet projects (I am including myself in the guilty-list). I
have also been very bad at replying to contributors (sorry specially to
Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) and should have
done much more to help those subscribers to understand how the tools that I
have developed and published work and how they can contribute.

One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate and
'come to life' (and I don't blame them for not participating, I blame
myself)

What Owasp needs now are strong, creative and active leaders who will have
to continuously prove (i.e. every week, every month, every year) that they
deserve to be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers
projects.

In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must guarantee
and fight for 

    1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and 
    2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join and be (if desired)
a non-contributor member)

, is because when Leaders stop behaving accordingly to his/hers
responsibilities (for personal or professional reasons) his/hers replacement
(amicably or not) must be an relatively easy and strait-forward process
(following the wishes of that project's community). 

As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an Owasp Leader can only be an
Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and recognizes his/hers
leadership (see the Linus example). 

In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where the
focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as
possible) in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.

B) My comments on .... Jeff as a OWASP leader

Before I go any further let me just say that:

    - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in Owasp
    - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the creation of the Owasp
Foundation
    - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous when he accepted (from
Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader
    - I think that Jeff should continue to have some management roles in
Owasp 

But I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader,
since I don't think that Jeff has (based on his actions so far) what I would
consider to be the right profile to be the main leader that Owasp needs
today

Although Jeff is beyond doubt a very active and productive Owasp member
(whose technical competence and professionalism is of the highest caliber) I
don't think that Jeff (to which I sincerely apologize for such a public
criticism) has the energy, vision and 'craziness' required to lead a project
like Owasp (as it is today). Maybe it is Jeff's training as a Lawyer that
makes him risk-adverse, maybe it is just his personally, and maybe it is
just the current phase that Owasp is currently in (there is no reason why
Jeff's profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten
years time).

What Owasp needs now is to have an energetic, dynamic, thought provoking and
inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into a being major player in the Web
Application Security World, and help it to make the world a 'safer' (and
better) place.

at the current moment in time), I think that Owasp should ( in the short
term) NOT HAVE A MAIN LEADER! 

In the short term, Owasp should only have operational-leaders (or whatever
they would be called) responsible for specific operational tasks (for
example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the Owasp
servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business
development exercises, etc...).

Hopefully the crisis created by Mark's departure will create an environment
where the new future Owasp Leader will appear, and his/her promotion to
Owasp leadership is accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and
Members.


C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP

Another factor which in my view is not helping the development of Owasp is
the fact that Owasp is trying to do something that the security industry
doesn't want to happen. For example: 

    - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web Application
Security,
    - the Development of Open Source security tools, 
    - and ultimately addressing the real problems that are creating the
current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'

Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too much
money with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in
actually solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their
markets). 

The reality is that the ones that have most to benefit from Owasp, are the
current 'Security products/services buyers' because these are the ones that
are currently buying overpriced and incomplete products/solutions. The
problem is that these 'entities' (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs,
persons) need to have something to buy (which OWASP currently doesn't have)
and are used to (and demand/expect) a credible, professional and reliable
service.

In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the Security
Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) and
should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, etc...)
which have most to benefit from Owasp work.

The current Owasp successes (like the wide spread usage of the Top 10) must
be built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and
perceived independence is one of Owasp biggest assets


D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'

I also find fascinating the fact that the current Owasp-dotNet leader (i.e.
me) has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team
regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published:

    - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)
    - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting Environment (SAM'SHE)
    - Asp.Net Reflector
    - Online Metabase explorer

The only logic explanation that I have for this situation (since these tools
DO actually work and have helped hundreds of companies to improve their
Asp.Net hosting environments) is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse'
these tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current
Full Trust Asp.Net environment is.

Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the industry,
since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a vibrant
development community continuously developing and improving these tools. The
reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,  is because
Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies to
security issues and  shows how low the current level is :-(. 

For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): 

    1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), 
    2) think that they are not doing enough, and 
    3) say that they are making a massive mistake with their current lack of
acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net Vulnerabilities;

, based on my professional experience, I still think that Microsoft DOES
TAKE Security much more Seriously than most other Software companies out
there (which again shows how we are still very far away from starting to
tackle the real security problems and vulnerabilities that exist in today's
Web Applications).

E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp

Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a crazy-open-source-guy which
lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to state, that I fully understand
that Money and Financial reward is a major element in our current society
and way of live. I am not anti-corporations, anti-capitalism or anti-making
money.

We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you manage to
get paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for
it)

I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that position
where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do for
free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to Owasp,
is the fact that a substantial percentage of my income for the past 6 months
originated in projects directly related to my participation and
contributions to Owasp.

Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that I
received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: Thank
you Owasp

In some ways I am a good success-story of how Owasp can directly and
indirectly provide a good financial and professional reward to active and
participative members.

I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in certain
areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), Owasp has the
opportunity to become a 'recruitment center' for high-skilled, reliable and
effective developers (since all that the employers would need to do is to
look at the prospective employee participation and contribution record)

F) My comments on ... the fact that most Owasp projects have no
participation from the community

In my view there are several reasons why most Owasp Projects don't have more
than 2 to 5 active participants:

    1) lack of time: Most good and knowledgeable members are currently very
busy and have very little time to dedicate to personal projects

    2) the current '2h to start being productive' paradigm: which means that
if I (for example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate
at least 2 hours to the project in order to start being productive
(sometimes even for simple things like adding content to the new website!).
What we need is the '30m to start being productive' paradigm or even better
the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when functional,
actually create an environment where participants regularly spend 2 hours or
more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the ones that don't
know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to practice a
music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), you must create
an environment where there is there is almost no effort required to start
practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be able to
start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). This
means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always be
set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow for
spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) when
the musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which usually
gets 'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment
where it is easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not
associated with spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.

    3) Most Owasp projects don't have clear 'this is want you can do to
participate' instructions and require quite a lot of work and effort by the
would-be contributors and participants

    4) Owasp memberships is not big enough where there are enough people
with an 'itch' (i.e. problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's
'itch', which will make them go one step further and spend the time, effort
and dedication required to become an active participant and member

    5) Most projects are very dependent on the availability and energy-level
of the project leader (which usually is also its author / creator).
Hopefully we will soon reach a critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?)
where the community surrounding a project is vibrant enough to compensate
for the regular MIA (Missing in Action) periods

    6) and probably the most important one. Collaborating in an Open Source
project is VERY HARD. Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD
claims such as 'Open Source projects are created by a network of Kids and
clueless programmers' (note that I am a non-violent person and very rarely
get angry). Sending a comment like "humm, i clicked on this button and the
application crashed" is very easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment
like "I installed the application and I had a problem with XYZ function
which I traced back to the method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it
which solved the problem" or "I've read this 50 page document and here are
my comments" is :

    - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code or words)
    - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT
MATTER
    - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, 
    - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in effect sending a
criticism of someone else's work)
    - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. "...I think that this
is a better way to do it...") which is always a hard thing to do
    - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that project's leader) PAST
BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS 

So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of
contributions of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open
Source projects have as their main contributors highly intelligent,
competent, dedicated and creative IT Professionals. 


G) My comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp Projects

Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first person and say
that I am as guilty of anybody else for not participating in other Owasp
projects. 

I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat,
WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test guide, since
I have used them professionally.

And the reasons that I have for not participating are:

    -  I didn't have the required time to put myself in a position where I
was able to send meaningful contributions 
    - Those project leaders didn't put any pressure on me to participate and
didn't actively encourage it (when one is working on several projects at the
same time, unfortunately the projects that don't make any noise and are not
critical tend to live permanently on the
'to-do-list-when-I-have-2-free-hours' pile)
    - There is almost no documentation to help  (although I do admit that I
didn't make a huge effort to find it)
    - I didn't need professionally an improved version of those
tools/documents (i.e. I didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are
scratching)

To start contributing in these projects I needed to be given simple, quick
and meaningful (i.e. could be used in the actual project) tasks (the '30m
task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I should
participate. 

I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must
subconsciously feel that my efforts will be appreciated.

I am assuming that If motivated and focused I  would produce material of
high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although
anybody should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no
duty to spend any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the
appropriate skills, knowledge, attitude or commitment)

And this is the bottom line: it is the leaders of these projects (WebGoat,
WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, Testing Guide and the Penetration Test list) that
have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to participate, and if they
don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then they should 
    1) step down (from leaders), 
    2) become 'normal' project members, 
    3) continue to submit their contributions  and 
    4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another Owasp member that is
willing to do it.

Now, does my lack of participation on these projects make me a 'taker'!
Somebody that is 'exploiting' the work of the talented and dedicated persons
who worked on this projects? Do I deserve (due to my lack of participation)
to be kicked out of the current mailing lists and not be member of those
projects?

H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp

I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in OWASP today. 

It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open Source)
that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the
Owasp-dotNet efforts.

Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the same
ideals and it is always very refreshing when one meets other like-minded
individuals.

Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to help
Owasp in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly
responsible for his decision. The main reason I am writing this 'Open Letter
to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain and Owasp is able to
learn from its mistakes and change the current environment which caused one
of Owasp most important members to quit.

Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must have
been for him to take this decision. 

I hope that this 'Open Letter to Owasp' kick-starts a healthy discussion and
is well received by the other Owasp Leaders and Members. 

Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out of
order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do let
me know. 

I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals are not
welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit and
find (or create) another Community

I) My comments on ...how Owasp can make money:

Just before I get into practical solutions (because one cannot only talk,
one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where Owasp can
make money:

 - Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants 
 - Owasp Consultancy 
 - Owasp Accreditations 
 - Owasp Official Curriculum
 - Owasp Books and White papers
 - Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)
 - Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)
 - Owasp Conferences

And what could this money be used for? 

In my view it should be used to pay for:

    - Owasp Administrative services 
    - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) Owasp Projects
    - Creation of Documentation
    - Packaging of Owasp Products 
    - Marketing and PR
    - Sales
    - Support to Owasp's product or services 


J) Ideas for the Future:

Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point Owasp in the right
direction:

     - In the short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader, since this
position (which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be earned
not given. This means that the next Owasp's leader should be chosen by
Owasp's Leaders with full support by Owasp's community

    - Jeff should continue to have several responsibilities within Owasp
management, but current Owasp leaders should be able to say "I would like to
take responsibility for 'XYZ' task" 

     - The current Owasp leaders should do what I recommended earlier and
actively encourage their communities to participate in their project.

     - The current Owasp leaders should also make an effort to participate
in each others projects.

    - A series of 30m tasks should be defined for each project, which will
allow the Owasp members to easily contribute and participate

    - On the short term, Owasp must have a CMS (Content Management System)
solution which allows authorized members to QUICKLY (in minutes) and EASILY
(not too many clicks) add content to the LIVE SERVER Hosting the main Owasp
and individual project's websites. I don't care if this is done with the
current Magnolia solution, with b-sec's CMS (support.binaryvision.com.au), a
very Expensive donated CMS (www.tomoye.com <http://www.tomoye.com/> ), with
FrontPage, with Dreamweaver or with NOTEPAD!!!! What I want is something
that doesn't get in the way, and I can get my content uploaded and published
to Owasp website in 10m. And (please don't kill me for this), in the
beginning I don't really care about how secure this system is. The first
objective is to create a dynamic, vibrant and very active community. If we
get maliciously hacked, then so be it!!!  Note that I am not saying that
Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a template) a secure
hosting environment. Just to avoid confusions let me say it again: "I do
think that Owasp should host its online content in an locked down
environment which is as secure as possible". What I trying to say is that
the current priority should be in creating vibrant communities (which could,
as one of its projects build a tool to create and configure secure hosting
environments)

    - There must be total clarity of Owasp finances and financial
operations. The current lack of transparency is not healthy and doesn't
promote contributions. I know that there are some short-term credibility
issues with the current low-turnover but I strongly believe that the
advantages of full openness are far bigger than the disadvantages.

    - Once the current Owasp finances are published, a short term investment
plan should be created which defines what Owasp wants to do, how much money
it requires, and where is that money going to come from (for example I can
(through my UK company) make some financial contributions to OWASP)

    - A series of 'Owasp Products' should be created (based on the current
Owasp projects) and sold online

    - Owasp should take a much more aggressive position in the Industry and
start making its Voice heard. And if this creates controversy, then so be it
(the open letter sent last month was a good start). From my point of view,
the moment Owasp starts to be attacked by 'respected' security companies and
organizations, is the moment that Owasp is starting to do its job right and
is starting to change the world
   
    - A formal Owasp Leader recognition process should be created which
publicly recognizes current Owasp Leaders and most active Project
contributors (since this will help those person's careers and will encourage
others to become leaders them selfs)

    - A formal 'Thank you' letter should be sent to Mark (signed by as many
members as possible) as a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for
Owasp

    - A meeting should take place to discuss this (and other) ideas

I hope that this made sense and if you made it this far, thanks for your
patience for reading this long, rambling and of my entire responsibility
'Open Letter to Owasp'

I'm looking forward to your comments

Best regards

Dinis Cruz

a Native-English speaker and I currently live in the UK (which might make
some of my analogies and words sound a bit weird to the US readers)

in a Crisis!</span></font></b><br>
<br>
Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of =
the most
active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his =
reasons
for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an environment =
where the
necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) prevents the departure of other key players and =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that =
Mark (and
others) will want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.<br>
<br>
As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues =
to be a
big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of =
measures
and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end of =
this
'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my personal =
opinion on
several issues which I think are very relevant to the current Owasp
environment/situation.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>A) My comments on .... =
&quot;Owasp's vs Open
Source&quot;<br>
<br>
</span></b>Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the =
moment, in
the Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source =
should
deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD =
LIKE to
happen.<br>
<br>
I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting =
the
concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).<br>

code
published under Owasp HAS the FREEDOM to be used by anybody and can be =
shared
and distributed by anybody. The fact that this material is FREE (as in =
beer,
i.e. no cost) is a nice side effect and a good inevitable practicality =
(since
if this material had to be paid for, its FREEDOM would not exist). <br>
<br>
Starting to <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>complain that 1) most =
Owasp
members are 'takers' instead of 'givers' and 2) they are only =
interested in
getting from Owasp things for FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost) , is in =
my view: </span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>offensive =
</span></b>to
those Owasp members (who I include myself in) since they are being =
called:
thieves, opportunistic and selfish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>short-sighted</span></b>,
since there is much more than meets the eye (things are never black or =
white)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>counter-productive</span></b>,
since it is creating unnecessary frictions and bad feelings amongst the
community, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Missing the =
point</span></b>,
since the main discussion point should be always about FREEDOM and not =
about
COST<br>
<br>
Going further, from my point of view, <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>blaming
the current lack of participation in Owasp projects on the 'quality' of =
the
current Owasp community</span></b> (which are being labeled as 'takers' =
and not
'givers')<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> is merely a scapegoat =
exercise
which fails to address the core problems and doesn't allows for the =
real issue
to be dealt with.</span></b><br>
<br>
In my view, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>it is not the =
responsibility and
duty of the current Owasp members</span></b> (for example the persons
subscribed to the current mailing lists) <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>to
be active participants and to dedicate enormous amount of time to those =
projects.</span></b><br>
<br>
In my view, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>IT IS THE SPECIFIC =
OWASP PROJECT
LEADER THAT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT =
where
those project's members </span></b>(and the other Owasp =
leaders)<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'> fell motivated to participate and become =
active
members</span></b>. This is not easy and takes quite a lot of work, =
dedication
and patience by those project leaders. <br>
<br>
This means that it is the OWASP PROJECT LEADER THAT HAS TO: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - make everybody aware of what is going on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create simple, relevant and usable mini-tasks =
which can be
executed by the community (it should be possible for somebody that =
wants to
contribute to be able to go to a web page and be given a task which =
will not
take him/her more than 30m to 2h to execute (compare that to the =
current
situation))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - actively market the Owasp project and encourage
participation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - manage expectations and ensure that the project's =
members
are motivated and happy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ensure that all contributions are respectively =
credited
and that people are rewarded for their time and commitment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - create products based on that Project's =
deliverables
(white papers, tools, security templates, etc....) which can be sold by =
Owasp<br>
<br>
Due to my past contributions to Owasp and my professional Project =
manager
experience, I believe that I have earned the right to make these grand
statements, specially since&nbsp;<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I =
consider
that I</span></b> (Dinis Cruz, current Owasp leader of the Owasp-dotNet
projects) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>am a very BAD LEADER =
because I was
not able to make the current 130 Owasp-DotNet subscribers participate =
in the
current Owasp-dotNet projects</span></b> (I am including myself in the
guilty-list). I have also been very bad at replying to contributors =
(sorry
specially to Michael Silk (article) and Kerem Kusmezer (http module)) =
and
should have done much more to help those subscribers to understand how =
the
tools that I have developed and published work and how they can =
contribute.<br>
<br>
One of my objectives for 2005 is to make this community participate and =
'come
to life' (and <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I don't blame them =
for not
participating, I blame myself</span></b>)<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What Owasp needs now are strong, =
creative and
active leaders who will have to continuously prove </span></b>(i.e. =
every week,
every month, every year) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>that they =
deserve to
be Owasp Leaders and that they can be responsible for his/hers =
projects.</span></b><br>
<br>
In fact, one of the main reasons why the 'OWASP Foundation' must =
guarantee and
fight for <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the FREEDOM of all material produced and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) the OPENNESS of its doors (i.e. anybody can join =
and be
(if desired) a non-contributor member)<br>
<br>
, is because <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>when Leaders stop =
behaving
accordingly to his/hers responsibilities</span></b> (for personal or
professional reasons) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>his/hers =
replacement </span></b>(amicably
or not) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>must be an relatively easy =
and
strait-forward process </span></b>(following the wishes of that =
project's
community). <br>
<br>
As in the Hacker or Open Source community, an <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp
Leader can only be an Owasp Leader if the Owasp community accepts and
recognizes his/hers leadership</span></b> (see the Linus example). <br>
<br>
In my view, this model creates a positive and healthy environment where =
the
focus is always on productivity and never (or at least as little as =
possible)
in political games and 'who is the boss' type of argument.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>B) My comments on .... Jeff as a =
OWASP leader</span></b><br>
<br>
Before I go any further let me just say that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I don't question Jeff's commitment and belief in =
Owasp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff has done a great job with the =
creation
of the Owasp Foundation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff was very brave and courageous =
when he
accepted (from Mark) the role as the main Owasp Leader<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think that Jeff should continue to have some =
management
roles in Owasp <br>
<br>
But <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I DON'T THINK THAT JEFF SHOULD =
CONTINUE
TO BE THE MAIN Owasp Leader,</span></b> since I don't think that Jeff =
has
(based on his actions so far) what I would consider to be the right =
profile to
be the main leader that Owasp needs today<br>
<br>
Although <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Jeff is beyond doubt a =
very active
and productive Owasp member </span></b>(whose technical competence and
professionalism is of the highest caliber)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I
don't think that Jeff</span></b> (to which I sincerely apologize for =
such a
public criticism)<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> has the energy, =
vision and
'craziness' required to lead a project like Owasp (as it is =
today)</span></b>.
Maybe it is Jeff's training as a Lawyer that makes him risk-adverse, =
maybe it
is just his personally, and maybe it is just the current phase that =
Owasp is
currently in (<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>there is no reason =
why Jeff's
profile is not the most indicated to lead Owasp in one, two or ten =
years time</span></b>).<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What Owasp needs now is to have an =
energetic,
dynamic, thought provoking and inspiring leader who can lead Owasp into =
a being
major player in the Web Application Security World,</span></b> and help =
it to
make the world a 'safer' (and better) place.<br>
<br>
From&nbsp; my point of view,&nbsp; <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>unless
Mark retakes the Job</span></b> (which is not an option at the current =
moment
in time), <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I think that Owasp should =
</span></b>(
in the short term) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>NOT HAVE A MAIN =
LEADER! </span></b><br>
<br>
In the short term, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp should =
only have
operational-leaders</span></b> (or whatever they would be called) =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>responsible for specific operational tasks =
</span></b>(for
example dealing with any issues related to: the Owasp Foundation, the =
Owasp
servers, the Owasp PR, the main Owasp website, the Owasp new business
development exercises, etc...).<br>
<br>
Hopefully the <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>crisis created by =
Mark's
departure will create an environment where the new future Owasp Leader =
will
appear, </span></b>and his/her promotion to Owasp leadership is
accepted/proposed by the majority of Owasp Leaders and Members.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
C) My comments on ... the industry current COLD reaction to OWASP<br>
<br>
</span></b>Another factor which in my view is not helping the =
development of
Owasp is the fact that <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp is =
trying to do
something that the security industry doesn't want to happen</span></b>. =
For
example: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the development of clear standards to evaluate Web
Application Security,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the Development of Open Source security tools, =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - and ultimately addressing the real problems that =
are
creating the current 'insecure Web Application Landscape'<br>
<br>
Most Security Companies (not everybody is like this) are making too =
much money
with Security Vulnerabilities to make REAL and ACTIVE efforts in =
actually
solving the problems (since in most cases this would kill their =
markets). <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The reality is that the ones that =
have most
to benefit from Owasp, are the current 'Security products/services =
buyers' </span></b>because
these are the ones that are currently buying overpriced and incomplete
products/solutions. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The problem is =
that these
'entities'</span></b> (Companies, Government Organizations, NGOs, =
persons) <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>need to have something to buy</span></b> =
(which OWASP
currently doesn't have) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>and are =
used to</span></b>
(and demand/expect) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>a credible, =
professional
and reliable service</span></b>.<br>
<br>
In my view, Owasp should stop trying to please (and not offend) the =
Security
Industry players and the Software Companies (from Microsoft downwards) =
and
should focus on these entities (companies, governments, persons, =
etc...) which
have most to benefit from Owasp work.<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The current Owasp =
successes</span></b> (like
the wide spread usage of the Top 10) <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>must be
built upon and nurtured, since current Owasp Market credibility and =
perceived
independence is one of Owasp biggest assets</span></b><br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
D) My comments on ... 'the Microsoft response'</span></b><br>
<br>
I also find fascinating the fact that <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>the
current Owasp-dotNet leader</span></b> (i.e. me)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:
bold'> has not been contacted by nobody from the Microsoft Asp.Net team
regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published</span></b>:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Security Analyzer for Microsoft's Shared Hosting
Environment (SAM'SHE)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Asp.Net Reflector<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Online Metabase explorer<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The only logic explanation =
</span></b>that I
have for this situation (since these tools DO actually work and have =
helped
hundreds of companies to improve their Asp.Net hosting environments) =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>is that Microsoft doesn't want to 'endorse' =
these
tools because all of them show how insecure and dangerous the current =
Full
Trust Asp.Net environment is</span></b>.<br>
<br>
Microsoft's position speaks volumes about the current state of the =
industry,
since they (and their clients) would benefit tremendously from a =
vibrant
development community continuously developing and improving these =
tools. The
reason why Microsoft's (lack of) response is important,&nbsp; is =
because
Microsoft is currently one of the most active and responsive companies =
to
security issues and&nbsp; shows how low the current level is :-(. <br>
<br>
For as much as I (Dinis Cruz): <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) criticize Microsoft (publicly and privately), =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) think that they are not doing enough, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) say that they are making a massive mistake with =
their
current lack of acknowledgment (and focus) of the Full Trust Asp.Net
Vulnerabilities;<br>
<br>
, based on my professional experience, I still think that <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Microsoft DOES TAKE Security much more =
Seriously than
most other Software companies out there</span></b> (which again shows =
how we
are still very far away from starting to tackle the real security =
problems and
vulnerabilities that exist in today's Web Applications).<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
E) My comments on ... making Money with Owasp<br>
<br>
</span></b>Before I get accused of being an idealistic or a
crazy-open-source-guy which lives on 'planet fantasy'. I would like to =
state,
that I fully understand that Money and Financial reward is a major =
element in
our current society and way of live. I am not anti-corporations, =
anti-capitalism
or anti-making money.<br>
<br>
We all need money to live, and the best model in life is when you =
manage to get
paid to do on something that you would do for free (i.e. not charge for =
it)<br>
<br>
I have to say that lately I have been very privileged to be in that =
position
where most projects that I worked where projects that I would gladly do =
for
free (if I could financially afford it). And what is very relevant to =
Owasp, is
the fact that a <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>substantial =
percentage of my
income for the past 6 months originated in projects directly related to =
my
participation and contributions to Owasp</span></b>.<br>
<br>
Which means that I have to personally thank Owasp for the exposure that =
I
received as the leader of the Owasp-DotNet projects. So here it is: =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Thank you Owasp</span></b><br>
<br>
In some ways I am a good success-story of how <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp
can directly and indirectly provide a good financial and professional =
reward to
active and participative members.</span></b><br>
<br>
I also would like to point that given the current skill shortage in =
certain
areas of Web Security (for example Asp.Net Security), <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp has the opportunity to become a =
'recruitment
center' for high-skilled, reliable and effective developers</span></b> =
(since
all that the employers would need to do is to look at the prospective =
employee
participation and contribution record)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
</span></b><br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>F) My comments on ... the fact that =
most
Owasp projects have no participation from the community<br>
<br>
</span></b>In my view there are several <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>reasons
why most Owasp Projects don't have more than 2 to 5 active =
participants</span></b>:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>lack of time: =
</span></b>Most
good and knowledgeable members are currently very busy and have very =
little
time to dedicate to personal projects<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>the current =
'2h to
start being productive' paradigm</span></b>: which means that if I (for
example) want to participate in a project, I will need to dedicate at =
least 2
hours to the project in order to start being productive (sometimes even =
for
simple things like adding content to the new website!). <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What we need is the</span></b> <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>'30m to start being productive' paradigm =
</span></b>or
even better the '10m to start being productive paradigm' (which when
functional, actually create an environment where participants regularly =
spend 2
hours or more on the project). Let me give a musical analogy (for the =
ones that
don't know, I am also a part-time professional drummer): If you want to
practice a music instrument on a regular basis (for example every day), =
you
must create an environment where there is there is almost no effort =
required to
start practicing (i.e. there should be no set-up time and one should be =
able to
start practicing 5m after deciding one wants to practice a little bit). =
This
means that your musical instrument and practice environment must always =
be
set-up (e.g.drums) or plugged-in (e.g. guitar) since that will allow =
for
spontaneous practice sessions (which usually are the most productive) =
when the
musician thinks 'I am just going to play for 10m - 15m' (which usually =
gets
'extended' into 1h to 2h sessions :) ). This creates an environment =
where it is
easy to practice and in the musician's mind, practicing is not =
associated with
spending 30m to set-up the practice environment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Most Owasp =
projects
don't have clear 'this is want you can do to participate' =
instructions</span></b>
and require quite a lot of work and effort by the would-be contributors =
and
participants<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp =
memberships is
not big enough </span></b>where there are enough people with an 'itch' =
(i.e.
problem or requirement) similar to the project leader's 'itch', which =
will make
them go one step further and spend the time, effort and dedication =
required to
become an active participant and member<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Most projects =
are very
dependent on the availability and energy-level of the project =
leader</span></b>
(which usually is also its author / creator). Hopefully we will soon =
reach a
critical mass point (the 10,000 member mark?) where the community =
surrounding a
project is vibrant enough to compensate for the regular MIA (Missing in =
Action)
periods<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) and probably the most important one. <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Collaborating in an Open Source project is =
VERY HARD</span></b>.
Sometime I fell an urge to hit persons who make FUD claims such as =
'Open Source
projects are created by a network of Kids and clueless programmers' =
(note that
I am a non-violent person and very rarely get angry). Sending a comment =
like
&quot;humm, i clicked on this button and the application crashed&quot; =
is very
easy and anybody can do it, sending a comment like &quot;I installed =
the
application and I had a problem with XYZ function which I traced back =
to the
method AAA.BBB.CCC, and I wrote a patch for it which solved the =
problem&quot;
or &quot;I've read this 50 page document and here are my comments&quot; =
is :<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - VERY HARD TO DO (since one is reading other's code =
or
words)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PARTICULAR
TECHNOLOGY OR SUBJECT MATTER<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - TAKES A LOT OF TIME, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - REQUIRES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE (since you are in =
effect
sending a criticism of someone else's work)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - FORCES THE CONTRIBUTOR TO TAKE A POSITION (i.e. =
&quot;...I
think that this is a better way to do it...&quot;) which is always a =
hard thing
to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - IS VERY DEPENDING OF THE RECEIVER'S (i.e. that =
project's
leader) PAST BEHAVIOR IN DEALING WITH CONTRIBUTIONS <br>
<br>
So, don't tell me that it is kids that make-up the main body of =
contributions
of successful Open Source projects. Most successfully Open Source =
projects have
as their main contributors highly intelligent, competent, dedicated and
creative IT Professionals. <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
G) My comments on ... Why I haven't participate on other Owasp =
Projects<br>
<br>
</span></b>Following my previous points, I can now speak on the first =
person
and say that<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> I am as guilty of =
anybody else
for not participating in other Owasp projects. <br>
</span></b><br>
I am particularly ashame by not having contributed to the WebGoat, =

documentation to help</span></b>&nbsp; (although I do admit that I =
didn't make
a huge effort to find it)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>didn't need
professionally an improved version of those tools/documents</span></b> =
(i.e. I
didn't had the 'itch' that those projects are scratching)<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>To start contributing in these =
projects I
needed to be given simple, quick and meaningful</span></b> (i.e. could =
be used
in the actual project) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>tasks =
</span></b>(the
'30m task' paradigm) and I have to be 'sold' on the idea of why I =
should
participate. <br>
<br>
I must be in a position where I am proud to participate and must =
subconsciously
feel that my efforts will be appreciated.<br>
<br>
I am assuming that If motivated and focused I&nbsp; would produce =
material of
high quality and that the project leader would find valuable (although =
anybody
should be able to join an Owasp project, the Owasp leader has no duty =
to spend
any time motivating and nurturing people who don't have the appropriate =
skills,
knowledge, attitude or commitment)<br>
<br>
And this is the bottom line:<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'> it is =
the
leaders of these projects </span></b>(WebGoat, WebScarab, Owasp Top 10, =
Testing
Guide and the Penetration Test list)<b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'> that
have the responsibility and duty to motivate me to =
participate</span></b>, and
if they don't want to do it (since that is hard and takes time), then =
they
should <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) step down (from leaders), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) become 'normal' project members, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) continue to submit their contributions&nbsp; and =
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) give (i.e. assign) the leadership to another =
Owasp member
that is willing to do it.<br>
<br>
Now, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>does my lack of participation =
on these
projects make me a 'taker'! </span></b>Somebody that is 'exploiting' =
the work
of the talented and dedicated persons who worked on this projects? =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Do I deserve</span></b> (due to my lack of
participation) <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>to be kicked out of =
the

<br>
H) My comments on ... Mark's influence on Owasp<br>
<br>
</span></b>I can honestly say that Mark is the main reason why I am in =
OWASP
today. <br>
<br>
It was his energy, principles and commitment to Openness (i.e. Open =
Source)
that made me join this community, donate my Asp.Net work and lead the
Owasp-dotNet efforts.<br>
<br>
Mark's has also been a very good influence on me since we share the =
same ideals
and it is always very refreshing when one meets other like-minded =
individuals.<br>
<br>
Mark's departure also makes me think that I should had done more to =
help Owasp
in 2004 and puts me in a position where I am guilty and partly =
responsible for
his decision. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The main reason I am =
writing
this 'Open Letter to Owasp' is so that Mark's departure is not in vain =
and
Owasp is able to learn from its mistakes and change the current =
environment
which caused one of Owasp most important members to =
quit.</span></b><br>
<br>
Knowing how much Mark loves Owasp I can't even imagine how hard must =
have been
for him to take this decision. <br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I hope that this 'Open Letter to =
Owasp'
kick-starts a healthy discussion and is well received by the other =
Owasp
Leaders and Members. </span></b><br>
<br>
Do send me your comments and criticisms, and if you think that I am out =
of
order, or what I am saying is stupid and doesn't make sense, please do =
let me
know. <br>
<br>
I also need to be happy in this community and if my ideas and ideals =
are not
welcomed at Owasp, then I will have to (with a heavy heart) also quit =
and find
(or create) another Community<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I) My comments on ...how Owasp can =
make
money:<br>
<br>
</span></b>Just before I get into practical solutions (because one =
cannot only
talk, one must also present solutions), here are some ideas of where =
Owasp can
make money:<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
<br>
</span></b>&nbsp;- Owasp Project sponsorships or Research Grants <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Consultancy <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Accreditations <br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Official Curriculum<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Books and White papers<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Products (based on the developed tools)<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Fund raising Events (Dinners, Presentations)<br>
&nbsp;- Owasp Conferences<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
And what could this money be used for? <br>
<br>
In my view it should be used to pay for:</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Owasp Administrative services <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Developer's time spend on specific (or sponsored) =
Owasp
Projects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Creation of Documentation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Packaging of Owasp Products <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Marketing and PR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sales<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Support to Owasp's product or services <br>
<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>J) Ideas for the Future:<br>
<br>
</span></b>Finally, here are some ideas which hopefully will point =
Owasp in the
right direction:<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
<br>
</span></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span =
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>In the
short-term, there should be no main OWASP Leader</span></b>, since this
position (which in my eyes currently still belongs to Mark) must be =
earned not
given. This means that the next Owasp's leader should be chosen by =
Owasp's
Leaders with full support by Owasp's community<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Jeff should =
continue to
have several responsibilities within Owasp management</span></b>, but =
current
Owasp leaders should be able to say &quot;I would like to take =
responsibility
for 'XYZ' task&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The =
current Owasp
leaders should do what I recommended earlier and actively encourage =
their
communities to participate in their project.</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>The =
current Owasp
leaders should also make an effort to participate in each others =
projects.</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>A series of =
30m tasks
should be defined for each project, which will allow the Owasp members =
to
easily contribute and participate</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>On the short =
term, Owasp
must have a CMS </span></b>(Content Management System) <b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>solution which allows authorized members to =
QUICKLY
(in minutes) and EASILY (not too many clicks) add content to the LIVE =
SERVER
Hosting the main Owasp and individual project's websites.</span></b> I =
don't
care if this is done with the current Magnolia solution, with b-sec's =
CMS
(support.binaryvision.com.au), a very Expensive donated CMS (<a
href=3D"http://www.tomoye.com/">www.tomoye.com</a>), with FrontPage, =
with
Dreamweaver or with NOTEPAD!!!! <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>What=
 I want
is something that doesn't get in the way, and I can get my content =
uploaded and
published to Owasp website in 10m</span></b>. And (please don't kill me =
for
this), in the beginning I don't really care about how secure this =
system is.
The first objective is to create a dynamic, vibrant and very active =
community.
If we get maliciously hacked, then so be it!!!&nbsp; Note that I am not =
saying
that Owasp should not have (and be able to provide as a template) a =
secure
hosting environment. Just to avoid confusions let me say it again: =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>&quot;I do think that Owasp should host its =
online
content in an locked down environment which is as secure as =
possible&quot;.</span></b>
What I trying to say is that the current priority should be in creating =
vibrant
communities (which could, as one of its projects build a tool to create =
and
configure secure hosting environments)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>- There must be =
total
clarity of Owasp finances and financial operations</span></b>. The =
current lack
of transparency is not healthy and doesn't promote contributions. I =
know that
there are some short-term credibility issues with the current =
low-turnover but
I strongly believe that the advantages of full openness are far bigger =
than the
disadvantages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Once the current Owasp finances are published, =
<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'>a short term investment plan should be =
created which
defines what Owasp wants to do, how much money it requires, and where =
is that
money going to come from</span></b> (for example I can (through my UK =
company)
make some financial contributions to OWASP)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>A series of =
'Owasp
Products' should be created</span></b> (based on the current Owasp =
projects)<b><span
style=3D'font-weight:bold'> and sold online</span></b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Owasp should =
take a much
more aggressive position in the Industry and start making its Voice =
heard. </span></b>And
if this creates controversy, then so be it (the open letter sent last =
month was
a good start). From my point of view, the moment Owasp starts to be =
attacked by
'respected' security companies and organizations, is the moment that =
Owasp is
starting to do its job right and is starting to change the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>A formal Owasp =
Leader
recognition process should be created which publicly recognizes current =
Owasp
Leaders</span></b> <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>and most active =
Project
contributors</span></b> (since this will help those person's careers =
and will
encourage others to become leaders them selfs)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>A formal =
'Thank you'
letter should be sent to Mark</span></b> (signed by as many members as
possible) as a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for Owasp<br>
<br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A meeting =
should take
place to discuss this (and other) ideas</span></b><br>
<b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'><br>
</span></b>I hope that this made sense and if you made it this far, =
thanks for

Subject: [Owasp-testing] What is a vuln?
Message-ID: <f3193c100611060209g6238b96cue6f80de0a475a76f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I just started to review the Testing Guide Wiki today, seen as yesterday was
the end date for submission of the different chapters.
One section is "Web application Penetration Testing":

In the introduction there is a question: "What is a vulnerability?" Seen as
this is a topic that everyone has a different opinion about, does anyone
want to give some suggestions on what a vulnerability is?

"Vulnerability: Weakness in an asset that gives rise to potential
exploitation"
" Vulnerability: Susceptibility to an attack due to a weakness in the
application"
" Vulnerability: Weakness in an application that gives rise to the CIA triad
(Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) being compromised"

suggestions appreciated.........

Do we have an official OWASP definition (Jeff/Andrew?)

Ok,
Nice, I like it. Short sweet, smooth, ergonomic and very neo-contemporary.

Any others?

Hi,
I'm not one to preach but can we watch the english used in the guide.
I know its not everyones first language (including mine :) but some of the
sections are a little hard to understand.
The quality of the work is great but can we be careful with the english
grammer?
thanks,
Eoin

2 doubts about the proposed definition:

1. The fact that is unexpected is not sufficient (in the mathematical
meaning of the word) for it to be a vuln (an unexpected behavior could
be a wrong rendering of screen colors, which is hardly a vuln). A more
precise definition to me would be "<snip> unexpected behavior of either
application or environment that represents a danger <snip>"

2. A vulnerability could be originated by a behavior that is 100%
expected, but that has not been perceived as a vulnerability yet (e.g.:
Cross Site Tracing attacks exploit what is precisely the expected
behavior of the TRACE HTTP method)

Sorry to somewhat play the devil's advocate here, but I think that we
need to be precise at paranoid level, when we come to such a fundamental
definition :)

What do you guys think ?

Hi,
Yesterday(5/11/2006) was the final date for the testing guide submissions.
Can the volunteers please post their work the the Wiki ASAP.
If you have not done the work you have volunteered for please tell Matteo or
me so we can figure out what needs to be done and if we can re assign it.

Thanks

Eoin

Very, very, VERY well put...

How about this:

A Vulnerability is defined as A) an unexpected behavior of either
application or environment  that represents a danger or B) an expected
behavior but that has not been perceived as risk.
This behavior normally represent a danger of  CIA triad
(Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) being compromised and/or
potential exploitation.

Thank you all for the excellent work! We are follow the right way to
create a great testing Guide!

We notice that there are some articles not yet written: may be you
need more time or may be you have written it on a sheet and you have
to post it.

In this phase it's important to understand the state of each paragraph
and your intention to finish it. So please, if you have not posted
your article drop me a mail to report your status on this project. If
you have no time to write your article we can reassign it and continue
the project, if you don't say nothing may be the project can fail to
be complete.

Thanks,
Mat

Hi Danny-boy!!

If you are going to review, when done put a "reviewed by <initial>" If you
take a look I have "reviewed by EK" on the sections I have reviewed.
Take subjects you are comfortable with.

Thanks,
Eoin

Ok,
thanks. May be in this phase a language review is fine.
But there are few articles completed ad 100% and we need a technical review too.

Next step:
- I'm sending an email to every contributors that have not posted their articles
- I want to understand what are the problems and who wants to write
- There are some sections that are harder than other: I notice that
there are some problems to work in team because the coordination
fails. I refer to:
* Web Servervice Testing
* Ajax Testing
* Writing Reports: value the real risk
- I think we can wait till 8th November for the latest volunteers..:)
- I'll send a second deadline for the new paragraphs.
- When we have all the paragraphs completed at minimum 80% we can
begin the techical review: I'd like to have an uniform view of the
Guide.

Thanks,
Mat

Hi,
I dont think we should have a "Language review" and a seperate "Technical
review".
Both should be done together. The  comment on language did not mean i was
focusing on it but just an observation..

Hi,

true, but I agree with Matteo that a fully fledged technical review
should wait until all chapters have been written.

We have these 2 days of "extended deadline" for the ones that haven't
submitted their parts yet, and it's wise to use them to review what we
already got, but after the 8th I would focus again on writing rather
than reviewing.

Just my 0.02 eurocents :)

Hi,

There might be a recurring problem if using the term exploitation in the
definition of vulnerability.

Anyway, in the larger security context I always say that a vulnerability
is a feature that is available to a user, though it was not included in
the (security) design. IMO, it is important to convey the notion that
the designers intended this and that use, yet somewhere in the
development cycle new features where inadvertently added.

In our case, this could be followed by a more stringent definition, or a
set of "features" that attackers might gain.

I hope this helps.

Cheers,
Ariel

hey all,

One word i've noticed being used frequently is that of "the attacker"  
when describing various software insecurities.
Since the testing guide is not a hacking guide and more of a software  
security assessment and testing guide, could you all refer to the  
person as a tester, rather than an attacker.

The hacking exposed books have caused more issues in this industry  
than most people would believe and by OWASP approaching the subject  
as a non hacking exercise and more software security testing, it  
would keep the professional image we are striving for

just a thought :0)

I disagree slightly.

When describing an attack, which these are types of, I use attacker in the
3rd person.  For example, in the summary for XML Content Level testing, in
order to explain why we are testing, I state:

"An attacker can craft an XML document(SOAP message) that contains malicious
content in order to compromise the target system. Testing for proper content
validation should be included in the web application testing plan."

I think this has more impact (but of course, I'll bow to the wishes of the
group ;)

Granted in this case its acceptable to reference an attacker,  
especially if its in the context of stating how it may be exploited.
The point i was trying to make was that some of the sections have  
been written more like the hacking exposed books. E.g

To exploit this like an attacker, you need to encode the GET string  
using Unicode.

It would be better suited to write:

To test for this issue, the tester needs to encode the GET string  
using Unicode.

It may sound pedantic, but this guide was never meant to be a hacking  
web applications and using language which portrays it as that gives  
the wrong impression.

Hi Mark,
I think your thought is correct. When describing an attack I think is
correct to use attacker in 3rd  person...but the question is that the
focus here is describe how to test a particular vulnerability...and
describing a test I think is correct tester....

When I am working on a pen-test engagement I think about my actions as
"attacking", even if I am wearing a white hat instead of a black one,
since "penetration testing" intrinsically means having an "attacking
stance" and performing aggressive actions that can be 100% categorized
as "attacking a target".

Therefore, I do not see any negative connotation in the word "attacker"
and I think the word can perfectly fit in the context of a security test.

Of course, the word must not be used in a "black hat" fashion. Going
back to Dan's example, I would have written "the attacker needs to
encode..." or "in order to perform this attack we need to encode...".

That said, it's fine for me to switch to "tester" if the majority feels
it's better for the Guide :)

Not pedantic - I agree with your correction for the example you provided.  

We should never create the impression that we are attackers or want to be
"like" attackers and authors need to keep that in mind, in my opinion and I
believe that is your most important point.

Granted in this case its acceptable to reference an attacker,  
especially if its in the context of stating how it may be exploited.
The point i was trying to make was that some of the sections have  
been written more like the hacking exposed books. E.g

To exploit this like an attacker, you need to encode the GET string  
using Unicode.

It would be better suited to write:

To test for this issue, the tester needs to encode the GET string  
using Unicode.

It may sound pedantic, but this guide was never meant to be a hacking  
web applications and using language which portrays it as that gives  
the wrong impression.

While feeding up the various "Breaf Summary"s in the Guide I was doing
a little spell check on most obvious misspelled words...

BUT

Must we use American (analyze, etc..) or British (analyse, etc..)
forms? No problem for either in my opinion, but we need to be
consistent in the form...

Please tell me one standard and I'll spell check every bit of text I
encounter ;)

Are you sure you want to open this can of worms? ;)

IMO, we should use the British spelling as it is more consistent with  
"Standard" English used in India, South Africa, New Zealand, Hong  
Kong, Singapore, Brunei, Australia(?) and Malaysia [1]

Hi all...

I've added the "In Brief" paragraph to the following tests:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Infrastructure_configuration_management_testing_AoC
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SSL/TLS_Testing_AoC
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_configuration_management_testing_AoC

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bypassing_Authentication_Schema_AoC
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Analysis_of_the_Session_Management_Schema_AoC

I'm proceeding orderly to fill up the other "brief summary"s.

Fell free to insult me, render me into dog's meat or simply correct
and adapt my lil paragraph if you find it inconsistent with the
general style of your articles. ;)

Greetings..

M "in brief" gpF

Hi,
Good Job. Make sure the "In Brief" is not a repeat of the description
paragraph so we are not repeating ourselves.

I'm trying very hard to di it, but normally a little grade of
"similarity" is obvious and should be expected...

My aim is to provide a sort of "flash card" that a user can quickly
look at, maybe just parsing quickly the different test...

Comments are always welcome....

Lets go with British spelling. More international for non english speaking
users.

Hello,

The time has come to conduct reviews on the guide.
Matteo and I expect to "freeze" submissions by week end (so try to finish
your sections, please :)
If you are willing to review (some bed-side reading!!) please respond to
this mail.
Once we have the panel we shall distribute the sections accordingly. (You
can't review your own stuff!!).

thanks,

Hi all,

It is necessary to bear in mind that the guide will be used by
pentesters that they will have to reflect in a report the results
obtained in every test.
In this sense, I believe that it would be interesting to include in
every test a paragraph that comments what results are expected and
probably even a template to present these results.
For example, in the SQL Injection test what do we expect to obtain? Only
data input to the application that are vulnerable? Or also it would be
necessary to know the type of possible injection (standard sql
injection, blind sql injection, union query sql injection, etc.),
affected functionalities of the application, etc.?
If the expected results are enumerated more homogeneous reports will be
created.

What does seem to you?

Regards,
-- Vicente Aguilera

Hi,
If deemed necessary to include a "Results expected" paragraph we can have it
under the Black Box Testing paragraph.

As we go through the reviews and see that the section would benifit from

Hi,
in our template we have defined it:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Template_Paragraph_Testing_AoC

The template is a guideline: maybe in some paragraphs not all the
items are applicable. It depends on the context.
In some case "Results expected" means that the tester should be expect
a particular information as answer from the application/server. For
example:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Analisys_of_error_code_AoC#Black_Box_testing_and_example
In other cases we explain it by describing an example with a real case
or just by words. For Example:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cookie_and_Session_Token_Manipulation_AoC#Black_Box_Testing_and_Examples

Thanks,
Mat

Hi,
I'll be available for a review as soon as i finish my writings (i
promise veeery soon! :)

I think we'll have to use some rule to have more stylish references.. 
I mean like in books/articles..
For Example, in one one of my stuff..

Instead of:

- LDAP Injection
[Rfc2254] defines a grammar on how to build a search filter on LDAPv3
and extends [Rfc1960] (LDAPv2).


We could use:

- LDAP Injection
Rfc2254 [1] defines a grammar on how to build a search filter on LDAPv3
and extends Rfc1960 [2] LDAPv2.

- References:
[1] T. Howes, 'String Representation of
LDAP',http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt ...
[2]... 
[3]...

This could be used uniformly on all *sections. 
Or maybe something like that.

Very, very, VERY well put...

How about this:

A Vulnerability is defined as A) an unexpected behavior of either
application or environment  that represents a danger or B) an expected
behavior but that has not been perceived as risk.
This behavior normally represent a danger of  CIA triad
(Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) being compromised and/or
potential exploitation.

If I may add my $0.02 in... I think a vulnerability definition must
change slightly:

 "... a condition in which an unexpected result of some action upon the
subject gives rise to a potential for exploitation"

My $0.02.

Language purity shouldn't matter, as long as it's spelt correctly and  
the grammar is reasonably tight.

Australian English != UK English != US English != Canadian English.  
There is significant divergence between formal written English and  
spoken English wrt to "that" and "which" and other common usage. For  
example, Australian English has always been hard core about the "- 
yse" endings for more than a hundred years, but UK has only become  
mostly hard core since the anti-US sentiment in the last 50 years.  
Both have retained the old style "-our" endings except for fortnight,  
which the Americans don't commonly use. There are small things I  
guarantee you will miss if you're trying to make a "pure" UK English  
document. US English has infiltrated the planet, and we all use US  
English unconsciously now.

Good luck in your language purity efforts. I'd prefer we stick to  
creating and tech reviewing excellent quality material until final  
proof edit than waste time on nonsense like language purity. That's  
why the Guide is in US English - less to worry about from a  
localization point of view.

thanks,
Andrew

ok guys, my 2 euro cents to the "brain storming" ;)

Vulnerability: a security exposure in the system design, implementation,
code, or the lack of a mechanism which arises as the unexpected result
of some action or occurrence which gives rise to a potential security
breach.

but, frankly, I don't think an accurate definition could be possible in
just two lines. Maybe an extended definition with more precision should
be required, because of the variety of the situations and perspectives.

btw, who can tell me how can I contribute with the spanish translation
of the new guide and where to start?
Please raise your hand, thank you.

Hi all,

In CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) training, we define vulnerability as:
1. A security weakness in a Target of Evaluation(*) (e.g. due to
failures in analysis, design, implementation, or operation).
2. Weakness in an information system or components (e.g. system security
procedures, hardware design, or internal controls) that could be
exploited to produce an information related misfortune.
3. Vulnerability is the existence of a weakness, design, or
implementation error that can lead to an unexpected, undesirable event
compromising the security of the system, network, application, or
protocol involved.

(*) An IT system, product, or component that is identified/subjected as
requiring security evaluation.

I agree with Daniel. It's difficult to realize in two lines a precise
definition.

Regards also from spain,
-- Vicente Aguilera

Hi Daniel,
that's a really good idea.
In this moment the guide is not complete: in this phase we are
collecting all the articles. Next week we'll begin the review phase.
I would like to finish by the end of November, but our deadline for a
complete product is december.

There is a good definition in CVE for what constitutes a vulnerability. 
This was discussed at lenght in at CVE's board mailing list and their 
definitions are exposed in their website.

IIRC their definition is "a vulnerability is a flaw that violates the 
security policy all/most organisations should have" (i.e. it violates 
policies which are closely related to CIA issues: Confidentiality, 
Integrity, Availability). A vulnerability needs not be exploitable to be 
considered as such and might not lead to a system (or application 
compromise).

An "exposure is a flaw that violates the security policy of *some* 
organisations". This disctintion is needed because some vulnerabilities 
might be considered as such for some organisations (like the web server 
of a Bank providing accurate information of the software it is running) 
but not for some other organisations (like a University).

Exposure is, commonly, associated with the revelation of internal 
information and it can be related to default web-server related 
functions in OWASP content. For example, the server-status / server-info 
feature in Apache might, or might not, be considered a vulnerability in 
some organisations and it is part of web server best practices to remove 
it, but some organisations might not consider it a security issue 
because that information being available fits their security policy just 
fine.

Hi all,
the Testing Guide now contains 72 articles.
If we freeze the Testing Guide in this moment, we have 63 articles to
be reviewed.

**********************************************
 We are waiting for the following articles
**********************************************

4.2.2 Spidering and googling (0%, Tom Brennan, Tom Ryan)
4.2.4.2 DB Listener Testing (0%, Alexander Kornbrust)
4.5.5 HTTP Exploit (0%, Arian J.Evans)
4.6.2.1 Stored procedure injection (0%,TD)
4.6.2.2 Oracle testing (0%,Alexander Kornbrust)
4.6.4 ORM Injection (0%,TD)
5. Writing Reports: value the real risk
5.1 How to value the real risk (50%, Daniel Cuthbert, Matteo Meucci,
Sebastien Deleersnyder, Marco Morana)
5.2 How to write the report of the testing (0%, Daniel Cuthbert, Tom
Brennan, Tom Ryan)


***********************************************************
 Here is the complete list of articles to be reviewed:
***********************************************************
* Introduction
1 of 1 article to be reviewed

* The OWASP Testing Framework
1 of 1 article to be reviewed

* 4.1 Introduction and objectives
1 of 1 article to be reviewed (no Meucci, Reviewed by EK)

* 4.2 Information Gathering (Reviewed by EK)
9 of 10 articles to be reviewed

*4.3 Business logic testing
1 of 1 article to be reviewed

* 4.4 Authentication Testing
5 of 5 articles to be reviewed (No Meucci, no Revelli)

18 of 21 articles to be reviewed

* 4.7 Denial of Service Testing
8 of 8 articles to be reviewed

* 4.8 Web Services Testing
6 of 6 articles to be reviewed (No Keary)

* 4.9 AJAX Testing
6 of 6 articles to be reviewed (No Di Paola)

* Writing Reports: value the real risk
We have to write about it. I consider it not yet finished.
O of 3 articles to be reviewed.

* Appendix A: Testing Tools
1 article of 1: need to update it searching all the guide for paragraps: tools

* Appendix B: Suggested Reading
1 article of 1: need to update it searching all the guide for paragraps: tools

* Appendix C: Fuzz Vectors
1 article of 1: need to be updated


*************************
Reviewers  Rules
*************************
1) Check the english language
2) Check the template: the articles on chapter 4 should have the following:

***Template***
[[http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Penetration_Testing_AoC
Up]]<br>
{{Template:OWASP Testing Guide v2}}

== Brief Summary ==
<br>
..here: we describe in "natural language" what we want to test.
<br>
== Description of the Issue ==
<br>
...here: Short Description of the Issue: Topic and Explanation
<br>
== Black Box testing and example ==
'''Testing for Topic X vulnerabilities:''' <br>
...<br>
'''Result Expected:'''<br>
...<br><br>
== Gray Box testing and example ==
'''Testing for Topic X vulnerabilities:'''<br>
...<br>
'''Result Expected:'''<br>
...<br><br>
== References ==
'''Whitepapers'''<br>
...<br>
'''Tools'''<br>
...<br>

{{Category:OWASP Testing Project AoC}}
***/Template***

In some articles we don't need to talk about Gray Box Testing or
other, so we can eliminate it.

3) Check the reference style. (I'd like to have all the referenced
URLs visible because I have to produce also a pdf document of the
Guide).
I agree with Stefano, we have to use a reference like that:

== References ==
'''Whitepapers'''<br>
* [1] Author1, Author2: "Title" - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt<br>
* [2]...<br>


'''Tools'''<br>
* Francois Larouche: "Multiple DBMS Sql Injection tool" -
http://www.sqlpowerinjector.com/index.htm <br>

4) Check the reference with the other articles of the guide or with
the other OWASP Project.

5) Other?

**********************
Reviewing planning
**********************
The reviewers are:
Daniel Cuthbert
Eoin Keary
Mauro Bregolin
Stefano Di Paola
Matteo Meucci

We can begin the 1st reviewing phase by review all 63 articles (nearly
13 articles per person). The deadline is 15th November at 20.00
(GMT+1) because we have 15th November as 1st deadline for the Autumn
of Code Project.

I've created the Review Panel URL:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Review_Panel
We can update our review status here.

I'll begin to review:
* 4.6 Data Validation Testing

Thanks,
Mat

Hi folks,

Not to put any pressure on you or anything... but the Testing Guide  
is referenced in the soon to be forthcoming SANS Top 20. :) Lots of  
folks will be looking at it over the next year.

Good luck!

thanks,
Andrew

The Review panel is as follows:

Mark Roxberry
Revelli Alberto
Daniel Cuthbert
Matteo G.P. Flora
Matteo Meucci
Eoin Keary
Stefano Di Paola
James Kist
Vicente Aguilera
Mario Bregolin

Matteo, how do you want to break up the work?

I believe all reviewers should make notes of issues encountered and we can
submit them to the list when done for comment and suggestions.

Also a time line for per reviewed section should be defined is possible.

any ideas?
Eoin

Hi,
I think that volunteers not involved in review can finish their
articles by 19th November.

Are you agree? Does someone get problems? Otherwise we can reassign
the paragraphs to other volunteers.

Thanks,

Mat,

I have a lot of comments for my reviews so far.  I think they will make the

Subject: [Owasp-testing] What is a vuln?

Please refer to the Honeycomb project and Glossary for definitions like
this.  There's a link on the main OWASP menu called "Vulnerability".  Just
link to it with [[:Category:Vulnerability]].  It's very important that we're
clear about all the threat modeling terms - Threat Agent, Attack,
Vulnerability, Countermeasure, Impact.

 

Thanks,

Ok,
Nice, I like it. Short sweet, smooth, ergonomic and very neo-contemporary.

Any others?

A Vulnerability is an unexpected behavior of either application or
environment.
This faulty behavior  normally represent a danger of  CIA triad
(Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) being compromised and/or 
potential exploitation.

Are there any plans to put the guide into a pdf or some other downloadable
format?  I'll volunteer if noone else does (of course put a revision date /
# on it, in the event the live version changes).

Hi Mark,
Our idea is to create a Wiki, a CD-live and pdf format of the Guide.

Thanks,

For the major documentation projects (Guide, Top 10, Testing Guide),  
we need a PDF version along with a Wiki / Live CD version. The PDF  
versions have always been very popular.

The OWASP Guide 3.0 has a publishing contract and when I get off my  
backside, it will be published. If you want, we can talk to our  
publisher about publishing the Testing Guide 2.0 in dead tree form.  
The profits from the sale of the book would allow OWASP to further  
OWASP's Goals such as run more AoC's in the future, and fun things  
like t-shirts for contributors, etc.

If we want to do a PDF version, I have a Word template which I would  
like us to use (it's currently being used by the Top 10 2007). To do  
this, we have to use a tool to extract the text from the Wiki into  
Word format. It takes about 20 minutes a chapter to re-format basic  
Wiki extracts into the OWASP Word template. I have a full version of  
Acrobat, so I can create high quality, bookmarked ToC'd PDFs with a  
small size.

Theoretically, it might be possible to use on of the few Wiki -> PDF  
generators out there to look like the Word version, but this would be  
an AWFUL lot of work to create the template to achieve an acceptable  
look and feel. The good news on this option is that once done, we  
could easily allow users to pump out up to the minute PDFs as long as  
we had adequate processing power. However, my past experience with  
this toolset is that it produces extremely poor quality PDFs, usually  
unreadable on screen, with no bookmarks or clickable TOCs. If that is  
the state of automated PDF creation, I'd prefer we didn't do it at  
all as it's like turning up to a job interview over-pierced, in torn  
jeans and a day old t-shirt covered in last night's fajitas.

If we want to a book version, NSP have a very special Word and Open  
Office template (the ONLY formats they accept) which allows them to  
reflow the text into Framemaker. Again, it takes about 20 minutes per  
chapter to re-format the text. This template looks extremely  
ordinary, so we wouldn't use that for the PDF version of the document.

thanks,
Andrew

Hi all,

 

this is just to check whether the Testing Guide has placeholders for the
concepts of HTTP request smuggling, response splitting-CRLF injection (and
if so, where).

That'a great idea. Why not? Tom have some other ideas about it.

I this is the better solution, could you send me your Word template,
please? I have to do that by the end of year.

Hi Mauro,
yes these concepts are not yet described.
I'd like to fill it in HTTP Exploit paragraph (Session Management).

Thanks,

Hi,
To get the guide in"book" form would be a real achievement.
Once the wikii is done lets incubate the guide for a little while prior to
baselineing it into paper form. I think we need to set up a feedback form
once the guide is finished and well publicised so we can see if it needs any
tweeking and if it is covering all the bases and is what one would expect of
the guide.
Lets focus on the task at hand and get the wiki complete, get feedback from
the www and then take  it from there.

Eoin

How are other people getting on with the reviews? the review stage is key to
the quality of the guide and as important as writing a chapter/section

sleep now!!

Hi there,
Just a suggestion, once one is finished reviewing a section can they update
the review panel page.
Can you also look at a previously reviewed section, reviewed by another
person and scan over the comments.

A key part of the review process is to action issues discovered.
We need to action the comments so if you have the time can you look at the
comments and maybe suggest solutions or even action them yourself.


thanks,
Eoin

Hi,
next steps to complete the Testing Guide are the following:

a) Review (1st review deadline: today. Other articles will be reviewed)
4 people are actively reviewing the Testing Guide. We are updating the
guide and add our comments here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Review_Panel

b) Write new sections (deadline: 22th November)
4.2.4.2 DB Listener Testing (0%)
4.6.2.2 Oracle testing (0%)
Any volunteers? The deadline for these new articles is 22th november

c) Finish the articles that are not at 100% (deadline: 19th November)
In some cases reviewers are adding some contents to the articles.
I ask to any writers, please could you finish your articles by 19th November?
Please could you take a look at reviewers comments:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Review_Panel

If you have some problems to complete your article by time, please
could you drop me a line? Please, be tuned :)

Thanks,
Mat

Hi,
after some good Mauro and Eoin comments on paragraph: "4.2 Information
Gathering",
Antonio has had the great idea to add a new paragraph titled:
"4.2.1 Web Application Fingerprint"
This par. describes how to test for what version and type of web
server are running and search vulnerabilities and know exploits.
I've edited the Index. Are you agree?

Tonight is the deadline for the second draft of our articles. Are you
ready? Do you need some help?

Thanks,
Mat

I would add looking at cookies as another viable technique to perform
fingerprinting. Depending on cookies names and formats it is possible to
infer what web server / application server is being used.

The idea is documented in a couple of posts (and maybe in other places I am
not aware of)
http://seclists.org/pen-test/2006/Jan/att-0210/cookie_fingerprinting_txt
http://seclists.org/pen-test/2006/Jan/0249.html

Don't know if Javier or others pursued further the idea or expanded the
cookie db.

Regards,

Mauro

This is a really good (easy) idea.  Having a cookie db to reverse lookup
cookie names and formats would be very useful in diagnosing what's
running on the server side. Most of the authz/authn gateways use a
cookie format of their own as well.

Anybody willing to start a list at OWASP?

The guide has a piece on Error codes which could be expanded or a starting
point for which to feed into a search engine of error codes.
Could we use the OWASP google search for searching for such codes?

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Completion of Appendix C: Fuzz Vectors Assistance
Message-ID: <1163983742.4560fb7e3d7b2@www.uncon.org>

Hi,

I would like to assist in the completion of appendix C involving fuzz vectors.

Based on the categorisation of JBroFuzz Generators (recently an OWASP project
under alpha) I would like to provide a similar breakdown of categories and
perhaps include one or two that I feel should be included.

Naturally, all feedback is more than welcome and I am attempting to get a
similar discussion going for the jbrofuzz mailing list.

Thanks,

Subere.

I can add a new section to my article about cookies.
The other issues (returned messages and errors) are already covered in 
the article in the refernce section.

Hi how are we all on this fine winter morning?
I added the Fuzz vectors some time ago to assist the Webscarab fuzzer.
One can cut and paste the vectors defined on that page and use in the
webscarab fuzzer.

I personally dont see any point in defining each vector, and saying what it
is or does. There are other resources in the guide to define responses such
as error codes etc.

I would prefer if the fuzz vector section is touched that a new page be
added so one can still "cut and Paste" the list into a test file to use with
webscarab et al.

cheers,
Eoin

Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP AOC LiveCD- Status--ideas
Message-ID: <00f501c70db3$3ba33fd0$0202a8c0@purehackjp>

Hello List,
 
I wanted to update everyone with the status of the LiveCD and also start a
thread to document everyone's ideas on what should be on the CD. I started
this LiveCD around June this year with the following goals;
 

*	Portable LiveCD with all tools needed to perform a app
audit/pen-test
*	A single media image containing all the OWASP tools and documents
*	Including tools and research relating to;
*	        RFID
*	        VOIP
*	        Wireless
*	        BlueTooth
*	        Network/Infrastructure

As you know it was selected for AOC, so it's now at the 50-60% mark. That
is.. it's stable and it has a handful of tools/documents.
 
I have decided to follow the OWASP website structure for tools and documents
on the CD. This is as follows;
 
Releases
    Tools
    Docs
Alpha
    Tools
    Docs
Beta
    Tools 
    Docs
 
So far.. this is what I have on the CD..
 
/OWASP/
 /Releases/
  /tools/
       /WebGoat/
       /WebScarab/
  /docs/
       /OWASP_Guide
 /Alpha/
  /tools/
       /jbrofuzz/
  /docs/
 /Beta/
  /tools/
       /Cal9000/
  /docs/
 
/Pentest/
 /apps/
      /paros/ version 3.2.13
 /db/
 /network/
      nmap 4-11(installed in bin dir/
 /Voip/
 /RFID/
 /Social_Engineering/
 /Physical_Attacks/
 /Exploit_Frameworks/
      /MetaSploit 2.7/
 /misc/
      Nessus_Client

What would everyone like to see on the CD?? I'm going to add the wiki and
will then spend more time on the menu. But first, I am going to go under
each project and determine if tools and documents are available to be put on
the CD.s
 
Cheer,
 
JP

>>>JP>>> Yeah... There are a few MS tools that may be useful.. I'd look into
doing something with Wine if possible and including it.. But I don't think
it would ever be a M$ bootable CD. 

Most of the application testing tools will be OWASP because that was the
goal in the beginning. But I'm not opposed to look into adding other tools
if needed to perform an audit/pentest.

Cheers,

JP

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Completion of Appendix C: Fuzz
	Vectors	Assistance
In-Reply-To: <f3193c100611210128x2b5df217ubb6db3f06b639df6@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <1164105144.4562d5b89bd04@www.uncon.org>

Hi and thanks for your email,

In no way was I suggesting to describe what each request does; more to just
provide categories for the fuzz vectors. Something along the lines of:
"
1. Cross Site Scripting

2. SQL Injection (passive)

SELECT type of statements

3. SQL Injection (active)

INSERT type of statements
"
And perhaps include a few of the ones I encountered like:
"
4. Integer Overflows

-1
0
0x100
0x1000
0x3fffffff
0x7ffffffe
0x7fffffff
0x80000000
0xfffffffe
0xffffffff
0x10000
0x100000

5. Format String Errors

...

6. Buffer Overflows
"

It will still ruin complete copy-paste functionality for webscarab, but
ultimately give a user the ability to select the type of fuzzing they want to
perform, as well as provide a general categorisation demistifying this concept
of fuzzing a bit better for the wider public audience. 

Thanks,

Subere

Joshua,

That cuts quite a few MS tools out of the equation which would be a pity 
as there a couple of nice and free MS based tools for web app assessment 
as well (ok ok I am thinking Wikto/Crowbar...). Would you 
consider doing a live MS CD as well?

just my 2c,

love the email address Subere!!

I think this is well needed and could be a good part of the doc. The  
problem i've always found with fuzzing is that people don't have a  
clue what strings to use when, and we could reference each testing  
section with the info you are willing to write.

Hey, the Google <http://toolbar.google.com/T4/index_xp.html>  Toolbar has a
great spell checker that makes it easy to spell check your articles!!  You
choose spell check in the toolbar and then you can click on the underlined
red words to get alternative spellings.  Works great for me in IE7.

Thank you for your support!
You can take a look at  the Review Panel here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Review_Panel

We also need an expert on testing Oracle from the web. This is the
only article to write from scratch. We need a volunteer for that:
4.6.2.2 Oracle testing (0%,TD)

Thanks,
Mat
