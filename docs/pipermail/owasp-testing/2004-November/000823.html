<PRE>Thanks to everyone who managed to give time to edit this and get it to
this state, i think its looking amazing and cannot wait to get it out
there and get some feedback on all the work we have been doing.

So what are we left with?

- 1A
Jeff has kindly said he will look into doing this bit
- Quotes
Mark can we both approach the people listed and see if they will give quotes?
- Tools section
I agree, i dont see the need to list nikto (ver 1 that is) and nessus.
they arent really full application testing tools, ok they do have some
modules, but  think we should really concentrate on the tools that are
100% app related. I guess the same goes to ISS's internet scanner.

I have also removed the watchfire link

My main reason for pushing this release so agressively is that we are way
behind schedule. The longer we wait, the more people start to think that
we have no ability to actually deliver on what we talk about.

Comments welcome as usual :0)
