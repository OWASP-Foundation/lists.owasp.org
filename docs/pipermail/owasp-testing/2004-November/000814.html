Chapter 5 Comments:

 

In general this is a very good chapter.  Good job to whoever wrote it.  I just have a few comments.

 

1)      Page 19 Advantages and Disadvantages &#150; The last paragraph mentions automated tools.  I suggest adding a section to the document explaining technical and business logical application vulnerabilities.  Then we can suggest where to use automated tools.

 

Automated tools can be very helpful finding the technical vulnerabilities in application.  They can be a very useful time saver and quickly find most of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  On the other hand, automated tools are not good for find vulnerabilities in the business logic of applications. Therefore a manual code review is required.

 

2)      Page 20 Approaches to Source Code Review &#150; Maybe we can elaborate on the 4 different approaches.  For example the &#147;Call Tree Exploration&#148; can be performed from top-&gt;down or bottom-&gt;up.

 

3)      Page 21 Using Documentation &#150; This is the only section of the document that I disagree with.  The first paragraph suggests that &#147;documentation lies&#148; and reviewers should be extremely skeptical.  This may be the case for a non-critical applications or a small company which will, probably, never go through a security code review.

 

Critical production applications that warrant a security code review are build following well document development standards and go through change control processes.  Maybe the documentation does not lie but it hasn&#146;t been updated to reflect the latest changes to the application.  The code review should be used as a check against the documentation to verify that the developer is following the documented standards.  

 

Well that&#146;s my 2 cents&#133;  Very good job.

 

Thanks,

Stan Guzik
