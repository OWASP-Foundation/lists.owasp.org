Also worth noting is that oFlow should be online within the next two weeks
so this stuff can start to be published incrementally like the OWASP
columns.

Don't forget if you haven't signed up for anything by Sunday we will assume
you are no longer interested or don't have time and will remove you from the
list. 

Cheers

Mark
