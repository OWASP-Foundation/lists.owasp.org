<PRE>The original first section of the document has been posted into CVS on sourceforge as well as the full table of contents from the original document.  If you have any problems/questions about how to access the files, please let me know and we'll get you there  (all you need is a browser to pull down the files).

Mark has posted a good list to focus on first.  The intent is to work towards a completed document.  However getting to the completed document may still take a bit of time, so what we'd like to do is to get some of the topics written up and finished off and published as individual articles as they are also being integrated into the document.

I have also posted the full Table Of Contents (TOC) from the working document (dated March, 2003).  If nothing in the signup list appeals to you, take a look at this file and see if there is anything there.  This table of contents is a few months old and as everyone knows, this industry moves so fast that there are probably things that should be added so please post any suggestions for additions/changes.  The TOC is a guideline only and still not written in stone.

I also had an html version of the March 2003 document, but I seem to have misplaced it on my laptop.  I'll post the March document by Sunday.  It has some completed and semi completed sections which may be of use when we are writing.
