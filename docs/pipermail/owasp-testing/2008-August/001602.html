I have made changes to introduction section of the guide (*) to take care of
Marco Cova comments (**). 

Most of the changes are related to a formatting, very little content changes
as required.

 

Regarding the OWASP TM I refer to the one being written for source code
analysis (it the most up to date). I took out the code snipped for the note
on source code analysis and changed a little the wording to emphasize common
limitations. 

 

I have included a little introductory summary text at the beginning of
section 4 to help the transition between the concepts expressed as part of
section 3 of the guide vs. 2 and new ones I added as section 4 of vs3 of the
guide.

 

Regards

 (**)

I've completed a read-through of the guide (except a few sections toward the
end), changing some things along the way (mostly to fix typos or clarify
paragraphs: yes, sorry for all those minor edits :-)).

 

Here are some more notes/comments, which hopefully should be addressable in
a short time (the number refers to the chapter/section, &quot;all&quot; means it is
applicable to the whole content):

all: There should be a standard format for references: different sections
use different styles (e.g., inline, footnote).

all: Remove all references to part 1/part 2 of the guide and use appropriate
chapter numbers instead.

2: It refers to a detailed threat modeling methodology (&quot;Part 2 of the OWASP
Testing Guide (the detailed 'How To' text) will outline a specific Threat
Modeling methodology&quot;), which doesn't seem to exist The paragraph &quot;A Note
about Static Source Code Review Tools&quot; is very confusing (what is the code,
what is the undefined variable temp?): it should either be improved
substantially or be removed.

Before the section on Security requirements, there is a link to the TOC:

is that supposed to be there?

What is meant by &quot;application security frame categorization&quot;?

&quot;From the defect management and reporting perspective, software quality and
security testing can leverage similar issue categorizations and

metrics&quot;: not clear

Section 3 and Section 4 are a bit disconnected. It probably would be good to
have a paragraph to introduce Section 4, so that it is clear why it's there.
For example, something along the lines of &quot;if you want to have a successful
testing program, you need to know what are the objectives of the testing.
These objectives are specified by security requirements. This section
discusses...&quot;

Some parts of the last section overlap with the content of the next chapter.
