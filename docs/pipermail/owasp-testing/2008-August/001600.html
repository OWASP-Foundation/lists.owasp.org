<PRE>Hello list!

I've completed a read-through of the guide (except a few sections toward
the end), changing some things along the way (mostly to fix typos or
clarify paragraphs: yes, sorry for all those minor edits :-)).

Here are some more notes/comments, which hopefully should be
addressable in a short
time (the number refers to the chapter/section, &quot;all&quot; means it is
applicable to the whole content):
all: There should be a standard format for references: different sections
use different styles (e.g., inline, footnote).
all: Remove all references to part 1/part 2 of the guide and use
appropriate chapter numbers instead.
2: It refers to a detailed threat modeling methodology (&quot;Part 2 of the
OWASP Testing Guide (the detailed 'How To' text) will outline a specific
Threat Modeling methodology&quot;), which doesn't seem to exist
The paragraph &quot;A Note about Static Source Code Review Tools&quot; is very
confusing (what is the code, what is the undefined variable temp?): it
should either be improved substantially or be removed.
Before the section on Security requirements, there is a link to the TOC:
is that supposed to be there?
What is meant by &quot;application security frame categorization&quot;?
&quot;From the defect management and reporting perspective, software quality
and security testing can leverage similar issue categorizations and
metrics&quot;: not clear
Section 3 and Section 4 are a bit disconnected. It probably
would be good to have a paragraph to introduce Section 4, so that it is
clear why it's there. For example, something along the lines of &quot;if you
want to have a successful testing program, you need to know what are the
objectives of the testing. These objectives are specified by security
requirements. This section discusses...&quot;
Some parts of the last section overlap with the content of
the next chapter.
3: The figure could be improved: the text in the boxes is not always
aligned consistently (sometimes it's left-aligned, sometimes it's
centered); fonts in the figure should be used consistently; some of the
boxes in the figure do not correspond to any part of the text
4: The list of contents at the beginning of section 4 should be kept
synchronized with the general table of content. For example, the section
&quot;AJAX Testing&quot; in the ToC is missing in the list of the section.
4.1: The introduction should probably be modified to reflect the fact
that this is a chapter in the testing guide, rather than a guide on its
own.
Capitalization is not used consistently in the table.
The term &quot;gates&quot; seems non standard and later sections use &quot;entry points&quot;.
4.2.4: The section is titled &quot;web application fingerprint&quot;, but its
content focuses only of fingerprinting &quot;web servers&quot;: I think either
the title should be changed, or the content should be updated with
similar techniques for fingerprinting web applications.
4.8: &quot;break the pattern&quot;: unclear
&quot;OS commanding&quot; is non standard, better &quot;OS command injection&quot;
In most of the sections, testing follows a 3-step process: identify
attack vectors; determine if sanitization can be bypassed; perform the
actual injection: should the sections have a more standardized structure
to reflect this?
4.8.1: Would it be good to have at least one example of attack that shows
something else than creating a popup?
4.8.3: To be finished
4.8.4: To be done
4.8.5.2: &quot;The single Quotes Problem&quot; paragraph is not very clear
&quot;direct SQL injection could be easily accomplished at a level
depth depending primarily on mysql version&quot;: unclear
&quot;Note: there is no way to bypass single quotes outstanding filename&quot;:
unclear
4.8.5.4: &quot;Blind sql injection vulnerabilities are by no mean the most
frequent type of vulnerability&quot;: not clear if they are frequent or not
4.8.12: should be expanded to talk about file injection (e.g.,
include/require in PHP) and dynamic evaluation of code (e.g., eval)?
4.8.13: should the example be clarified, e.g., to specify that the
application passes the user input to a function like system() or open()?
4.8.14: format string is not a buffer overflow. Also, what about
integer overflow vulnerabilities?
Should this section mention more sophisticated defense mechanisms?
4.8.14.1: The last reference seems wrong.
There are non-printable characters in the last &lt;pre&gt; section
4.8.14.2: The description of stack overflow seems quite basic. Should we
add more sophisticated attack techniques?
4.8.15: &quot;incubated&quot; seems a non standard term: should it be
&quot;persistent&quot; or similar instead?
4.9.1: This seems to mix two different problems: one is insufficient
validation allows a user to force the DB to scan the entire table; the
second are algorithmic complexity attacks. See more detailed comment at
