Subject: [Owasp-testing] Risk Calculating Methodology - Likelihood and
	Impact Levels
Message-ID: <CACUdxz-5_DbFvotKTq6HkeM-wzUdXJeFX0pgU6-i61TQMk1DVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

1)   On the pdf of the Owasp Testing Guide v3,
http://www.owasp.org/images/5/56/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3.pdf

p.329 i can see :

Likelihood and Impact Levels
0 to <3 HIGH
3 to <6 MEDIUM
6 to 9 LOW


On the website at URL:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_value_the_real_risk
It's exactly the opposite (which is, i suppose the correct version):

*Likelihood and Impact Levels*  0 to <3 LOW  3 to <6 MEDIUM  6 to 9 HIGH

Could someone confirm/correct if so  please ?



2)   Anyway i'm interested also on the V4 up to date, can't find the link,
if someone can give it to me please ?


Thanks and Best Regards.
M.Dupont

Hi,
yes you are right, the wiki is correct.

Hi,
OWASP SAMM and OWASP Testing Guide are 2 different projects. The first
is a an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a
strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks
facing the organization. To evaluate the maturity of a Company you have
to perform interviews. The only part related to the Testing Guide is in
the Security Practice called "Security Testing" inside the
"Verification" Business Function.

We discussed many time ago the OWASP Testing goals. Here you can read
about it:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Introduction_and_objectives
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Guide_Introduction

So in this guide we want to explain the OWASP testing methodology.
Penetration testing will never be an exact science where a complete list
of all possible issues that should be tested can be defined. Indeed,
penetration testing is only an appropriate technique for testing the
security of web applications under certain circumstances. The goal is to
collect all the possible testing techniques, explain them, and keep the
guide updated.

As discussed time ago the audience are the testers, also if we
introduced a Brief Summary for each paragraph to explain the issue and
how to test it from a high level point of view.

Thanks,
Mat

Hi all,
I've reviewed the ToC and add a new paragraph for each new issue to write.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents#4._Web_Application_Penetration_Testing

For example a new article will be like that:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_pollution_%28OWASP-DV-004%29

Regarding the set of articles to review I linked the v3 articles with
the idea to modify that.
For example:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_%28OWASP-DV-001%29

So from now the wiki will be our draft for v4 and v3 will be available
only via PDF.

Many of you are not assigned to an article.
Please, from now tell me what section would you like to write. We have
to assign all the articles in the next few days.

Feedback: The Toc is completed at 90%, please send me your feedback
about the new ToC and my notes in the Toc.

Now we can start writing!
Please keep me update (I monitor all the changes on the wiki). Use the
ml for general discussion and my email for specific issues.

Thanks,

Matteo,

I can write the Web Service Testing section (XML Interpreter).  However, as part of the web service testing methodology I assisted on for Black Hat USA last year there are other items to include besides how to exploit the areas listed in the XML Interpreter section.  For example, I'd like to include items specific to information gathering and web services and testing for web service management misconfigurations (example: Axis2 or GlassFish).  These two sections could be added to sections 4.2 and 4.3 respectively.  BPEL testing should also be added to the XML Interpreter section as well.  Also, can we reference the section "XML Interpreter" as "Web Services" instead?  Or could you name it "XML Interpreter (Web Services)" for context clarification and for ease of reference?

Thanks,

Hello All!

Follow the feedback about the draft ToC:

*4.3 Configuration and Deploy Management Testing *

Ismael >> Somebody suggested previously to test for sensitive information
in logs.
Assuming that there is a test for connection strings couldn't we check also
for sensitive information in logs?
And this is the kind of test if we are covering only black box tests, in
theory the tester would need to gain
access in a way they could perform the test.

Ismael >> About Unpatched components and libraries (e.g. JavaScript
libraries)[New! NOTE: tu discuss it] :
I think this could be covered inside OWASP-CM-001/OWASP-CM-002.

*4.4 Authentication Testing *
Failure to restrict access to authenticated resource [New!]
Ismael  >> Isn't it authorization?

*4.5 Session Management Testing*

4.5.2 Testing for Cookies attributes (Cookies are set not ?HTTP Only?,
?Secure?, and no time validity) (OWASP-SM-002)
4.5.6 Testing for Session token not restricted properly (such as domain or
path not set properly) (OWASP-SM-006) OWASP-SM-006
Ismael >> Couldn't these tests be covered under the same item?

*4.6 Authorization Testing*
4.6.2 Testing for bypassing authorization schema (OWASP-AZ-002)
4.6.5 Testing for Failure to Restrict access to authorized resource
(OWASP-AZ-005) [New!]
Ismael>> Is the 4.6.5 a test in which the tester would check for resources
that were supposed to be protected and actual are not (e.g. Top Ten A8)?
What's the difference between 4.6.2 and 4.6.5? Looking at the Testing Guide
V3 I understand the 4.6.5 is already covered.

*Other comments:*
Aren't we covering Test for HTTP Dos? Do you guys think isn't worth to
cover this kind of DoS test?

Regards.

Yes, I agree

No, the idea here is to verify if all the resources that need an
authentication are accessible also if a user is not authenticated

Yes, I agree. Maybe Testing for cookie attributes can test also for 4.5.6?

We need to have this test more explicit because it is one of the Top10
risk. Maybe we can merge it and eliminate 4.6.2?

No one is modifying the wiki, so I'm going to send emails to the authors
asking for a plan.
