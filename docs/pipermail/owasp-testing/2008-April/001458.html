<PRE>Hi all,
the new OWASP Testing Project v3 is started!

We want to review the OWASP Testing Project v2 and create the OWASP
Testing Guide v3 by the end of next August.

Problem to be Addressed:
many additional sections should be updated and reviewed. Also
additional areas of discovery should be addressed. the guide currently
covers alot but could cover much more.

Benefit to OWASP Members and Community:
A reference to the testing community that is updated by the community.
Should provide many of the answers one would look for when testing an
application for security.

Goals and Deliverables:
The guide to be updated with a defined list of topics and the current
guide reviewed.A revised and updated Testing Guide which shall be more
extensive thanever before.

*** I phase: create the Index ***
- Call for participation.
Work is underway on the 1st phase of the testing guide v3, and we
would love to hear from volunteers who could offer their knowledge in
creating this phase. If you have knowledge and experience in
application testing, and can spare a few hours a week, please contact
me and subscribe to our ml. Everyone can partecipate to write the new
Guide. If you are interested, please contact me.
This is the draft of the new index:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents</A>
- Index brainstorming.
- Discuss the article content.
Deadline: Sun 18th May 2008.

*** II phase: start writing ***
After creating the new Index, we will assign each paragraph to the
volunteers, and we start writing!
Each author will write the article on the wiki and reviewed by the
OWASP Testing guide team.
Deadline: 30th June 2008

*** III phase: start reviewing ***
Create the reviewer team.
Assign each new paragraph to the reviewer.
Deadline: 20th July 2008
