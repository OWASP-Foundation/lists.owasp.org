Tony,

The methodology does specify using an average. Using max would probably
reduce the resolution; you would like be biasing towards all high risks
which may be a bit too alarmist and does not assist with managing risks.

Accountability is difficult. Attribution is often not possible so it may be
a weak factor for your use case. We typically use this as 'was it an
insider or an outsider?' Not all of the factors will be considered equal
for your organization, so I think tailoring it to best suit your needs and
risk tolerance is the best option to ensure that you are standing up
something that gets adopted and helps.
