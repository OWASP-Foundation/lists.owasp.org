Jim,

Based on http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2014-June/013821.html
it would appear that the OWASP Board has realised it has made a
catastrophic mistake and is attempting to reduce some of the damage.

I would like the OWASP Board to agree to the following in relation to the
OWASP Testing Guide:

1. The current v3 release is listed as Flagship Status on the associated
wiki page(s) since it exceed the requirements of Flagship Status at the
time it was published

2. The upcoming v4 release will undergo a review for Flagship Status if any
"new" objective measure(s) are set by the OWASP Board.  If the OWASP Board
have not set "new" objective measure(s) then the upcoming v4 release will
be also be listed as Flagship status by default.

Since the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology is related to the 2014 release of
the OWASP Top Ten then ***no*** the above shouldn't also be applied to that
OWASP Project also unless there is a 2015 release that Jeff Williams, Dinis
Cruz and other former employees of 02 i.e. Sonatype, including Josh Corman,
who I noted was also part of https://www.ruggedsoftware.org/about/ that was
also promoted within the 2014 release, have no further involvement in
[future] releases of the OWASP Top Ten.

So um, catastrophic is a pretty high bar[1].  Some other events that could
be considered catastrophic:
* openssl
* actual bad things happening other than bruised egos

Now I know that our industry has a reputation for high-drama egos, but why
not consider, for just a moment, that this was done as a good faith
exercise to help ensure that all flagship-labelled projects are *actually*
flagship quality?

Rather than spending your time fretting about what the process will be to
get the flagship status back once the processes are sorted out, why not
focus on making your project continue to kick ass, especially after
repeated acknowledgement that it was, and should continue to be a flagship
project?

We all want OWASP to be a better organization and burning cycles over
project status and labels is not helping make things better.

Cheers,
Yvan

Yvan,

Yes its catastrophic but I commend Jim for reconsidering his position.

Both Jeff Williams and Dinis Cruz collectivity wasted over 250K of
money provided to a "charity" to fund their own self promotion and
[self] interests, including hiring their personal friends as staff,
four all expenses paid holidays (two summits, ESAPI summit, 02 Tour,
Training in South America, etc) which could have been used to fund a
full time developer(s) supporting ESAPI full time, etc

The supporting evidence of the above so far (and there is more) is:
1. http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2008-October/006898.html
2. http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2011-January/009563.htm

Please don't reply that these examples are three years ago as I will
counter that the [former] OWASP Board hasn't learnt from their
previous mistakes then.

Furthermore, particular members of the OWASP Community as a whole have
to understand that it is not a "privilege" to contribute [IP to
OWASP].  If anything, reapplying for the same Flagship status that the
OWASP Testing Guide had is nothing more than an unnecessary burden.

I am going to be pretty blunt about this.  Those examples were from 3 or
more years ago.  I have been involved with OWASP for 10 years (at my
earliest recollection, 2004, when I launched the Winnipeg chapter), and I
have seen (on and off mailing lists) that left a bad taste in my mouth;
that hasn't changed my desire to help my chapter be better, and to find
ways to contribute.  There are always going to be people who use
organizations like OWASP for self-aggrandizement, and there may even be
corruption by some bad actors (I don't know the specifics).  If you are
aware of ongoing corruption, then collect the evidence, and put a proposal
forward to the group for a 3rd party audit of the organization and let the
OWASP members voice their opinions.  Otherwise don't make claims that you
can't back.

I don't know Dinis personally, but I have looked at O2 on several occasions
since it's release, and while it never took a huge place in my tool box I
certainly see it's value and appeal; OWASP should be supporting projects
that are innovative and try new things.  It is unfortunate if money spent
didn't have the desired outcome, but those are the breaks of funding
research and development.  If OWASP didn't back new and experimental
projects then it is entirely possible that Simon may not have brought ZAP
to the table when figuring out where it should live.

I won't speak for the past, but the current efforts to update and refresh
OWASP practices and policies have been sorely needed, and comes at a time
when people are seriously questioning whether or not OWASP brings value to
the industry.  OWASP needs to put a better foot forward, and part of that
is recognizing projects that should bear the benefit of the OWASP brand,
*and* keeping those products (whether they are tool, library, or doc
projects) accountable to maintain their status as a 'gold-star' tool.

If you think putting in some basic effort to preserve the OWASP brand is an
unnecessary burden, then I question your commitment to protecting OWASP,
not the team working on the QA project.
