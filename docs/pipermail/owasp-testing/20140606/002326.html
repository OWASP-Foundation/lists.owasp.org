<PRE>I am going to be pretty blunt about this.  Those examples were from 3 or
more years ago.  I have been involved with OWASP for 10 years (at my
earliest recollection, 2004, when I launched the Winnipeg chapter), and I
have seen (on and off mailing lists) that left a bad taste in my mouth;
that hasn't changed my desire to help my chapter be better, and to find
ways to contribute.  There are always going to be people who use
organizations like OWASP for self-aggrandizement, and there may even be
corruption by some bad actors (I don't know the specifics).  If you are
aware of ongoing corruption, then collect the evidence, and put a proposal
forward to the group for a 3rd party audit of the organization and let the
OWASP members voice their opinions.  Otherwise don't make claims that you
can't back.

I don't know Dinis personally, but I have looked at O2 on several occasions
since it's release, and while it never took a huge place in my tool box I
certainly see it's value and appeal; OWASP should be supporting projects
that are innovative and try new things.  It is unfortunate if money spent
didn't have the desired outcome, but those are the breaks of funding
research and development.  If OWASP didn't back new and experimental
projects then it is entirely possible that Simon may not have brought ZAP
to the table when figuring out where it should live.

I won't speak for the past, but the current efforts to update and refresh
OWASP practices and policies have been sorely needed, and comes at a time
when people are seriously questioning whether or not OWASP brings value to
the industry.  OWASP needs to put a better foot forward, and part of that
is recognizing projects that should bear the benefit of the OWASP brand,
*and* keeping those products (whether they are tool, library, or doc
projects) accountable to maintain their status as a 'gold-star' tool.

If you think putting in some basic effort to preserve the OWASP brand is an
unnecessary burden, then I question your commitment to protecting OWASP,
not the team working on the QA project.
