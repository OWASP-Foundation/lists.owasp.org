Here you go...

1) Figure out what cookie, url parameter, or hidden field the site is using
to maintain a session
2) Search the code for that name
3) Trace all uses of that back through any variables, methods, etc...
4) If you find any -- write it up and strongly recommend that they use the
one provided by their webserver or application server -- like JSESSIONID

If they come up with a good reason why they have to roll their own (and none
are coming to my mind real quickly), then you gotta check the code to be
sure that the sessionid is cryptographically random and long enough not to
be guessable, only used over SSL, times out, destroyed on logout, etc...

Glyn, Any chance we can use the Chapter you wrote on Session Management
Testing as an appendix to Testing Part 1 to show readers what to expect
in Part 2 ?

Anyone volunteer to write a chapter a section on using Code Review to
test session Management that will compliment Glyns Chapter (which was
pen testing focused) ?

Message-ID: <200403011203.HAA03074@renown.cnchost.com>

I hear what you are saying but here is one last thought for my context. I always view dev as code creation and deploy as a multi-step process that includes pre-prod, staging, prod etc. As gary mcgraw points out (i may have misread) its still software (code) until its deployed in some form (local sanbox whatever) before you can pen test it. I am getting hooked on terms and phases as i want to make sure this is intuitive to dev teams and not just us sec folks.
 
That said i think as long as we cover the virtues of testing types well, the reader will draw thier own conclusion as to which is more apprpriate for them. My fear is many will see it as an either not and pen test as its a more familiar term. I think we need to carefully craft message.

      I think nothing but good can come from getting exactly this dicussion out in
    the open.
    
    My experience is that most vulnerabilities are found (far) more quickly by
    looking at the source than by any other method.  *BUT* it takes a long time
    to get fast.  You need people who are very good programmers (that for
    whatever reason don't want to write code everyday) AND they need to know a
    lot about security and what the patterns look like in different languages.
    
    Comparing the approaches is a bit of apples and oranges. Penetration testing
    generally doesn't search everything and has a lot of false alarms.  If we
    did a code review to that level, we could finish in 1/10 of the time. But we
    can be far more complete and accurate by checking the code. I'm not against
    pentesting -- there are many reasons why code is not available.
    
    There are, of course, some problems that pentesting is faster at -- 
    particularly web and app server configuration issues. But there are also
    many problems that could NEVER be found with pentesting -- logic problems,
    hidden features, dead code, thread safety, and lots more.  This is where we
    find the biggest problems by the way.
    
    I disagree with recommending code review during development and pentest
    after.  Actually, I think it would be best to do some of each (with internal
    people) throughout the lifecycle. Then maybe a third party review to confirm
    before deployment.

Hi all

Here is my first draft, I have some questions, though. that's why I'm
not sending my definitive outline (some sections could disappear)

1 are we making the scope table and the advantages/disadvantages tables?
how are they going to be defined?
2 I, in the white box testing section I recommend "issue tracking" and
"put in action what you've learned", but it is not supposed to have them
for all testing methods? IMHO it is not a section specific issue but
part of the testing framework.

What do you think?

please provide feedback,

JC


PS I tried to write Web application sensitive points in a why/what/where
form (when applicable) without implicitly writing those words.

      OK guys, sorry I have been out of the loop a bit so far travelling but ...
    
    I think we have a good basis for the framework that I need to write up. I have seen various good docs or bits of docs floating. 
    
    Can we all send in whatever we have an have an amnesty tomorow. I will put it all together and send out later tomorow night for review / progress report.

I am working in the draft but I was approached by two big banks today who both asked me if OWASP would develpo the same thing. 

They basically want a checklist of things that should be tested for in a web app pen test so that they can use it to request services and get consistency as well as compare internal tests. 

I think this is something we as a testing group can turn around really quick and release without too much of a problem. What do you think ? Anyone got a starting template ?

An example would be

Session Management
Test Mechanism
Test Time Out Value
Test Entropy of Tokens
Test Tokens sent over SSL
Test .......

I totally agree.

IMHO this can be achieved faster if we brainstorm sending all our thoughts, then you can group them and finally release a document. mark has already started by suggesting some points.

What do you people thing?

Cool. 

And this can slot into the Pen Test part of Part 2 of the Testing projects overall document.

Message-ID: <200403110039.TAA26689@swiftsure.cnchost.com>

I made a start...I will continue after dinner and hopefully have a list for review later tonight.

I think its inline with Glyns list etc

I think we need to scope this as

Internet Pen Test Only 
Check List Format (ie simple)

I think we can get a first draft out easily. We should then align the layout with the OASIS Thesaurus of issues that should be complete after the next OASIS meeting on March 23rd.

Here's a couple ideas for an Access Control (aka Authorization) section:

1) Account Separation - Ensure that one user cannot access another user's
account
2) Privilege Escalation - Ensure that users cannot manipulate the system to
perform functions or access resources beyond their role.
3) Least Privilege - Ensure that roles are limited to the resources and
functions they need.

Where would we put the instructions for how to test these things?

In-Reply-To: <200403092331.SAA08745@bellerophon.cnchost.com>
Message-ID: <E1B1SVv-0006iY-SJ@sc8-sf-list2.sourceforge.net>

We currently use a rough 'crib sheet' of questions at Corsaire, relating to
Authentication and Authorisation, Session Management, Input & Output
Validation and presentation issues.  Some of the questions relate to the way
the site operates (e.g. how are users registered, what session tokens are
there and how are they issued) and others relate to the security concerns
(e.g. is there an account lockout, are 'secure' tags used on cookies, are
session IDs provably random).

That's the kind of approach I was taking in the session management testing
chapter I produced.  The categories below map to the sections & questions in
that draft chapter.  The login one isn't written yet.

The test categories in use on the current draft are as follows:

- Authentication and Authorisation

Login Credentials
Test login credential issuance and administration

Privilege
Test users of different privilege	

Login
Test the processes for login, logout, lockout etc.

Password Quality
Review the strength of permitted passwords

Password Privacy 
Test how passwords are stored, handled and passed within the application
(e.g. use of encryption, back-end password storage)

Password Recovery
Test the recovery procedure

Re-authentication
Determine where re-authentication is used (e.g. on password change) and if
the method is secure.

- Session management

Session ID Analysis
Observe the Session IDs and determine the format, type and test for any
information leakage (e.g. encoded user data)

Technologies
Which COTS session management (if any) are in use?

Creation
How are session IDs created, e.g. are they random or static, are user
details used in their creation?

Issuance
Test the generation and issuance of Session IDs (e.g. when and how)

Revocation
Test the effectiveness of session revocation and its use from client and
server perspectives

Transport
Determine and test the security of Session IDs in transit (e.g. encryption,
secure tags, caching)

Control
Test issues related to how Session IDs stored and tracked, such as multiple
user sessions and server-side resource to track and control them.

Portability
Test the impact of portability and hi-jack

Expiration
Test expiration times and mechanisms for reasonableness and effectiveness.

OK Gents

As always I would love to have had more time on this today than I did
but it is moving again. I will complete more tomorrow (and later
tonight) but I wanted to send out an update.

I am not sure about you but I like to work by creating the headings and
then filling in the details when the big picture is good. I am starting
to really like the flow we have now. 

Responsibilities are;

Chapter 1 - MC
Chapter 2 ?
Chapter 3 - JC
Chapter 4 - MC (done but not added or formatted)
Chapter 5 - CD
Chapter 6 - MC
Appendix A - ?
Appendix B - ?

For the two appendices, I think the aim is to focus on quality rather
than list every book, paper or tool we can find.

Let me know if you want to take on 2 or the Appendices. 

Also there are big holes in Chapter 3 i.e. no pen testing overview or
documentation / design testing overview.

Of the source code section in there today, my personal thoughts are it
is bordering in the how (i.e. prescribing things to test for) rather
than describing the process. Thoughts ?

Lots more to come tomorrow.

I know Carl was including a Principle that you should measure your testing.
I think there are lots of reasons for this that we can spell out including
improving educational effectiveness, understanding more vulnerable
applications and components etc. 

I have been working in this a lot with clients recently and measuring code
(KLOC's) and pen testing (need a good classification scheme like OASIS WAS
(shameless plug) is somewhat easier than measuring security the requirements
and design stages. 

Has anyone ever seen any work or have any thoughts on measuring security at
that stage of development ?

Hello 

I have been following this project and although I haven?t had the time
to send in my comments to the files posted, I would like to contribute
the attached document.

This document (which I believe contains several questions and 'requests
for information' relevant to this project) was created by me whilst
working on a security audit to a EDRM software (EDRM is Electronic
Document & Records Management) The document contains the purchaser's
security requirements.

They are basically the security questions that the company buying the
software (the purchaser) is asking to the software supplier (I removed
all references to the customer and software provider).

I think that it very important to provide these 'buyers' as much
security information as possible. This will allow them to put pressure
on the software manufactures, and be able to retrieve direct and strait
security answers (versus the Marketing stuff) 

I have now finished the security audit and am currently writing the
report. Once it is completed I will also post here a copy, which will
contain details about my methodology and the vulnerabilities discovered
(if I have time I will also try to convert some of my data into the main
OWASP-testing document's format)

Best regards

Dinis Cruz

It is essentially the scanning vendors as far as we can tell and hear. For context you have to understand the politics and history so let me explain a little bit of it without getting in to the nitty gritty personal stuff. What OWASP does and why it is so well respected among the banks and companies that use our work, is to cut through the BS and tell the truth about web security issues. IMHO is generally not in the best interest of the scanning vendors or pure pen test companies as they are marketing their technology or services as a silver bullet. We know that a few of them have lost significant software sales deals when the client testing their tools against OWASP WebGoat. I was told one deal was a million dollars.

Take this project as an example of our work. Many of us make money from pen testing (me included) and it is easy to write a bias doc that promotes what we do rather than what we know people should be doing. OWASP is able to take the high ground. This is a truly unique thing that gets the respect of people.

Jeremiah (who runs webappsec) was involved with OWASP in the early days but we parted company very early on with a difference in direction and motivation. He has tried to create other OWASP type projects in the past at community.whitehatsec.com which is no longer in action. The individual who owns that domain once registered owasp.com and held us to ransom ! They also tried to have me removed from moderating webappsec but thats one for a beer in NYC !

I have spoken to a few of the people on the Web Security Consortium (including a few "Charter members") who said they have no real idea of what it is apart from a group that they were asked to join and they saw no downside. I can tell you that their intention to create secure coding standards caused quite a stir and there is a queue of heavyweights (real heavyweights) waiting for them to publish anything that is remotely biased towards blackbox testing or scanning tools. Its not that they are *totally* useless but that they are a smaller part of a big picture.

There intent to publish a classification scheme also conflicts with what we are doing at OASIS WAS (although a scanning vendor classification scheme will obviously be crushed by a true standards body scheme that they all intend to support anyways). Not sure the real idea there.

I am sure many of you will be approached or asked to work on this project in due course. My personal stance is that feelings are that OWASP needs to keep focused people with the right philosophy on the project and while OWASP is open to all, it MAY not be appropriate to have people who are also working on projects that are not complimentary and in cases down right negative to or about our work. Life is too short to deal with the stuff we had to in the past (we kept it off the lists) I want to keep on staying focused and the thing I love about OWASP today is that we don?t have to question anyone's motivation or judgment and can truly enjoy the people we work with. We will make sure we keep that mantra. I used to get enough politics and back stabbing in my work life (don?t know thanks to Foundstone) and don?t need it in my down time (OWASP).

I know we don?t need to justify the respect thing but just take a look at the Federal Trade Commisions recomendationand the email from Visa that I will forward on next.

FYI we are forming a steering committee and the official OWASP Foundation this summer along with very positive changes to get better organized and grow even more. There is commitment so far from 6 major financial services companies in the US to be apart of that steering committee. Big names. Big names ! That is real credibility ! The pen test check list we have been bashing about will be used by those banks to aquire services and judge their own testing. This is something no vendor driven group could ever achieve. I would like to see Visa (and I think they will) also adopt the OWASP Checklist as a form of vendor certification. With the OWASP conference in NYC (and now one also likely to happen on London in Novemeber), Testing 1, Guide 2 and ISO17799 due before summer, I think this will be a great year for OWASP. The steering committees and official support of these organizations will drive our credibility still further.

So in short, I think orgs like the Web Security Consortium have a place to play in the overall indusrty but they probably are all the more reason why OWASP is more important today than when we started it. 

As agent Scully said, the truth is out there !

Snip from mail today

I work with the Visa Cardholder Information Security Program which requires

program adherence for merchants and service providers that process, store,

or transmit Visa cardholder data. Details of our program are available at

www.visa.com/cisp, and of specific interest may be our Security Audit

Procedures and Reporting document under the Service Provider tab (tab is

about 1/3 of the way down the page). This is the detailed audit procedures

we require our assessors to use to validate CISP compliance. 

We work with many compromised entities, and as you may guess, find that many

of these entities have flawed web application software. I am updating the

audit procedures mentioned above with details about web application security

and want to rely, quote, and excerpt from your "The Ten Most Critical Web

Application Security Vulnerabilities" document and related OWASP documents. 

I think this is ok based on your copyright permission statement on the

bottom of the cover page, but wanted to confirm that and find out how you

prefer I include the attribution to OWASP. Please let me know if this is

ok, if there are any guidelines, and how best to do this. Thanks.

I think its getting into a good logical flow. Its the sort of doc I would like to read which is always how I try and judge things. Then again I read the Beano (comic) so who knows ;-)
 
I think your code review section is great. My only thought is that it maybe moving towards the How to do a code review rather than describe the process and the advnatges and disadvantages. IMHO I think that a lot of this would be perfect for the Methodoogy for code reviews which logically fits into Part 2. 
 
I guess things I would like to see would be 
 
Do you review line by line or perform code "inspection" ?
Do you check out an entire tree or branches of it etc 
How do you deal with linked libraries that are not part of your app?
 
Are there examples of things that you cant find from static anlaysis ie need runtime ?
 
Just my 2 cents

I agree -- this is headed the right direction.  I'd like to see a description of how you figure out all of the following...

- what kind of people you need on the team
- what code exactly is to be reviewed
- the size and complexity of the application to be reviewed
- what "secure" means for this application (business logic issues)
- how to package and deliver code securely for the reviewer
- what configuration information and libraries are included in the review
- what level of rigor is required
- are you going to find all instances of a flaw or only examples
- how do you figure out the risk related to a flaw
- how to write findings for *developers*
- does the review assume malicious developers or not
- whether to search the code or pentest the app
- which techniques are you going to use to find vulnerabilities in the code

Regarding the "Source Code Review" I believe it would be interesting 
to point out (after point '5' Use what you have learned. ) that many 
companies should make an effort in order to design security related 
functionality (session management, input validation, etc..) in a way 
that makes it possible to share this code amongst different projects.

It might be really obvious, but we've had some requests from big 
companies that were interested in having a "library" of security 
functions that could be used by the company's programming teams in 
order to avoid programmers solving issues in different ways. After 
all, if you are developing, for example, an ODBC connector, there are 
some things regarding input validation that you want to cover in a 
generic way (in order to avoid SQL injection) regardless of wether you 
do a deeper input validation in the code (i.e. accept only 
alphanumeric chars for a given parameter)

Regarding the "e. Application?s Fall and Recovery", shouldn't it be 
"e. Application?s Failure and Recovery"? Also, it might be interesting 
to point out that web applications should be designed in such a way 
that there is no single point of failure.

In "Principles of Testing" I'm missing something on the lines of:

"Don't expect to find _all_ the problems when doing a security test of 
an application. With very complex applications full coverage (both in 
source code review and black box testing) might be next to impossible. 
It is thus, very important to discover trends of insecure uses, that 
is, mistakes that are often repeated regardless of wether they lead to 
security issues or not. For example, if the web application is made up 
of 10 small applications, only 5 are tested and 3 of them do not do 
proper input validation (even if not directly exploitable to 
compromise the server or data) you can expect the remaining (untest) 5 
to also have these same issues. Since testing is, at the end, limited 
in scope by time, it might provide more valuable lessons if a global 
issue (affecting all aplications) is uncovered than saying "there is a 
security issue here and here". The first one can lead to a revisiting 
of the programming development methods which will improve all 
applications while as the second one will lead to a single bug getting 
fix (but many more might lie uncovered)"

I believe this is specially true in the case of black box testing of 
finished applications (as part of a penetration test) and I've 
experienced this in many ocasions. I know this has been discussed 
already in the list, sorry if this is repeating the obvious.

I'm sorry I haven't contributed comments to previous drafts. Sorry.

BTW, are you planning to include the stuff we wrote back in 
october-november? That could make a nice Appendix IMHO.

Regards

Javier

Hey all,

Mark has agreed for me to take ownership of this as a separate guide to the main Testing
guide and I?m hoping it will be
eventually used as a standard requirement when performing a web application security
review.

Over this weekend I will be changing the way the document is structured, my idea is
splitting it into two sections:

1st section:  
This will cover all the information learning stages that are done beforehand, such as
understanding the application,
viewing the source of the components and generally getting information ready to start the
main testing.

2nd section:
This section will aim to be the meat of the pen test, where the tester will check for
input validation weaknesses,
session management voodoo and other ninja testing techniques.

The best way to make this checklist work is for everyone to print out a copy and use it
when performing an application
test. Write down things you think should be included as well as the flow of the checklist
(example of this could be
testing to see what database is in operation before doing SQL insertion techniques).

Comments would be appreciated on the structure and design as well as the sections
(remember this isn?t the how do they
fix the problem, its how do we test and find the problem)

Daniel

B) Archive.org scan for older versions of the website (Though after an audit companies remove any unnecessary comments, many a times they don't change the password that was left in one of their prior versions of the site, this has lead to admin level access).
 
Nish.

Hey all,

Mark has agreed for me to take ownership of this as a separate guide to the main Testing
guide and I?m hoping it will be
eventually used as a standard requirement when performing a web application security
review.

Over this weekend I will be changing the way the document is structured, my idea is
splitting it into two sections:

1st section: 
This will cover all the information learning stages that are done beforehand, such as
understanding the application,
viewing the source of the components and generally getting information ready to start the
main testing.

2nd section:
This section will aim to be the meat of the pen test, where the tester will check for
input validation weaknesses,
session management voodoo and other ninja testing techniques.

The best way to make this checklist work is for everyone to print out a copy and use it
when performing an application
test. Write down things you think should be included as well as the flow of the checklist
(example of this could be
testing to see what database is in operation before doing SQL insertion techniques).

Comments would be appreciated on the structure and design as well as the sections
(remember this isn?t the how do they
fix the problem, its how do we test and find the problem)

Hi Team,

As you can see from the attached draft I have made quite a bit of
progress. Personally I am very happy with the way this is starting to
shape up. There is quite a lot more I / we need to do. However I think
that is easily achievable in one more weekend. 

I know a few of you are planning to send updates in this week. 

If anyone else has bandwidth we need some content before next Friday on

Threat Modeling (read the great chapter in Writing Secure Code or the
New MS book)
Attack Trees
Using UML To Model Security

I think between what is already assigned and what I have to do, that
should be a complete first draft.

I will pick this up next weekend and push to complete it. We can then
take a week to proof read, update and then get some comments / quotes.
Then release ! Phew .....

Would it be appropiate (in Input Validation) an specific section 
regarding test of encoding?

I.e. OWASP-IV-XXXX: Input encoding testing. Test if input validation 
is done regardless of enconding.

I've found a number of applications that filter appropiate input if 
it's ASCII encoded (i.e. %25 = %) but not if using unicode encoding 
(i.e %u0025 = % or variants) or UTF-8 encoding.

The paper "URL Encoded Attacks. Attacks using the common web browser"
by Gunter Ollmann summarises many of these
http://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/URLEmbeddedAttacks.html

I'm not sure if the "OWASP-IV-006" test covers this, applications 
might not accept URL encoded input (i.e. in a GET request) but accept 
it just as fine in a POST request (in the data)

Notice that the above paper also mentions the use of different 
formatting schemes for IP addresses (using IPv6) which might merit a 
different test.

Also, on the "Data Storage" section I would include an

"OWASP-DSC-005. Minimum privilege access to storage areas. Does the 
application use reduced privileges to access storage areas such as 
databases? Can the application run code (stored procedures) in 
different database sections or access databases which are not 
neccesary for the application?"

This type of testing is usually quite important when doing SQL 
inyection. It's quite different when the application is accesing the 
database as, for example, 'sa' user (in SQL Server) than if using a 
limited user/role than can only read the tables used by the 
application. Even if SQL inyection is possible, the risk is reduced.

Regards

Javier

I agree on the input encoding part, ill add a new bit to that section and include the data
storage.

I just remember I had written something for the OSSTMM that never got
released (who knows why, maybe it's only in ISECOM's "pay per view" area).

Some of the items of "Web Application Testing" might be useful for the
checklist (even though most of the stuff is already there). And,
maybe, the data flow approach is useful.

Feel free to use it as you wish. If you want changes to the data flow
I have the original sources (Visio) around too.

Regards

Javier

hmm the idea of that flow diagram would fit well with this doc, unless it should go in the
main testing doc???

I did have a look at the OSSTMM stuff this weekend and even though they do have a section
on web apps, it doesnt go as
deeply as this one will. Has anyone seen the beta version as that is supposed to have a
detailed app testing section but
i refuse to pay to access that doc

For sure.

It probably has the one I attached, I'm not sure about that.

Me too. I dislike the "pay per view" attitude ISECOM has recently 
(since last year) taken.

I didn't know OSSTM stuff was pay per view but it doesn't surprise
me...too many open source projects are going that way. This is one of
the reasons why all material is copyrighted to the free software
foundation ! Jeff Williams now has the not for profit OWASP Foundation
set up I believe. More on that later this week !

I like the flow diagram a lot. As I think we mentioned eventually we
should blend this pen test check list back into OWASP Testing Part 2,
but for now I see no reason why we shouldn't inlcude it. 

Great stuff !

Not sure about the attachment but I can't open it. Can you resend ?

Also I was at the OASIS WAS meeting today in Washington DC. We have
defined what I think is a really good scheme of vulnerabilities that I
think we should sync the OWASP Testing project to. One of the advantages
is that by using the WAS VulnTypes people can measure security such as
10% of issues are Injection.SQL, 3% injection.Script etc

I'll send a draft on to this list at the weekend.  

OASIS WAS is gonna rock hard !

Hi all

I'm sending my part of the OWASP testing guide, updated.  I've re-read OWASP guide and the initial and final Drafts Mark sent us and I found I was wrong in some points. I sould say I was not happy with my first draft but now I've changed some things for a "positive" point of view and taking away the "how" it's taking better shape. I could not work on some parts like advantages and deliverables part, oh well.

Thanks to Mark, Jeff and Javier for your feedback on last draft sent, it was on great help.

Additionally I have some thoughts

Mark, I think you omitted regulations in the first section of your "A Typical SDLC Testing Workflow" graphic.

Also I don't know if "OWASP guide" the one to mitigate OWASP Top Ten (and more than that) and OWASP Testing guide, won't be confused. Don't know if I'm "crossing the line" saying this, IMHO probably OWASP Guide should change it's name to something more descriptive, too late perhaps?.

Well, that's it

Later,
JC

Hi Jaun

Thankis this is great stuff. I still wonder if it is a little too
focused on the How and not the what, why, when, where of source code
review. Anyone else ?

I think we should call this the OWASP Testing Framework. The OWASP Guide
is really the OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications. It is the
staple diet though so I think its hard to change that name. 

Regulations, good catch sir. I'll drop it back in. That said does anyone
know of any regulations that apply ?

What happened to Carl Davis ?

(Draft)

Hi all

I'm sending my part of the OWASP testing guide, updated.  I've re-read
OWASP guide and the initial and final Drafts Mark sent us and I found I
was wrong in some points. I sould say I was not happy with my first
draft but now I've changed some things for a "positive" point of view
and taking away the "how" it's taking better shape. I could not work on
some parts like advantages and deliverables part, oh well.

Thanks to Mark, Jeff and Javier for your feedback on last draft sent, it
was on great help.

Additionally I have some thoughts

Mark, I think you omitted regulations in the first section of your "A
Typical SDLC Testing Workflow" graphic.

Also I don't know if "OWASP guide" the one to mitigate OWASP Top Ten
(and more than that) and OWASP Testing guide, won't be confused. Don't
know if I'm "crossing the line" saying this, IMHO probably OWASP Guide
should change it's name to something more descriptive, too late
perhaps?.

Well, that's it

Later,
JC

Mark,

Great progress. I have a few structural comments to offer for what they're worth.

As I read the threat modelling section, it occurred to me that it is a bit different that the "testing techniques' that it is listed as a peer with.  It seems to me that all the testing techniques rely on some understanding of the security requirements, which in turn are hopefully based on a decent understanding of the risk. Do you think it would be useful to pull out the parts of that section that are most useful during requirements gathering, and change the rest into some sort of design/architecture review?.

I found Chapter 5 - Principles of Testing to be a bit too far down in the document for me.  I like to get the principles out early and then develop them throughout.  That might just be a style issue though.

Great. Remember it not the how but a description of what it is, why it
useful, when you do it (i.e. cant do it until you can instantiate an app
or component) and the advantages / disadvantages. I would say not more
than 2 / 3 pages if possible ?

Okay...I'm back alive & well.  My recent travels have taken me to Atlanta
(for the recent WebInspect SPI course - can possibly add some content
regarding pros/cons of scanners if there is still room and after the
Principals are done) and then half-way around the globe for an engagement
where I ran into quite a few time-consuming issues.  Anywho, I have been
actively working on the 'Principals' all the while and will send out a draft
of what I have this evening (rain or shine).  I apologize for leaving

Hi all

Can't remember if I share this to you earlier, it's a little tought about scanners derived from the use of them (mainly Sanctum Appscan) for almost 4 years now.

I've found that no matter teir capacity, in an enterprise enviroment their attacks or assessments are "blocked" by firewalls, routers, proxies, IDS, etc. all this make them some kind inneficient and/or innacurate right out of the box, not even installed. IMO ideally they  would need a direct connection in a controled environment to deploy the potentital they have (low or high), this is, as I mention, ideally.

Regards,
JC

I tested them all in the past. The best founds 21% of issues on my
benchmark platform, the worse found 6%.  I could write a book on the
things they cant find but I cant be bothered to supply the free research
for the vendors ;-

Guys,

Nish mailed me and reminded me that he was already working in the pen
test section. There was a mail from him I missed in my inbox asking if
he was moving in the right direction. To save duplication his section
will be complete by the end of the week.

Sorry if that caused confusion Dan.

Its not flowing tonight so minor updates attached. 

I will tackle Chapter 6 in a big push hopefully tomorrow. With the other
work going on there are a few small sections and we should have a
reasonable first draft to at least start editing.

Gentlemen,
 
By my count (latest draft sent out) we currently have a total of 11
Principles.  I would like to suggest chucking "The Devil is in the Details"
heading and redistributing the current sub-bullets to other 'Principals' as
follows if there are no objections:
 

            -            Weed out false positives > Use the Right Tools

            -            Thoroughly explore logic in an attempt to expose
flaws > Use The Source Code When Possible

            -            Look for discrete vulnerabilities > Use The Source
Code When Possible

            -            Become intimate with the application > Know Thy
Target

            -            Evaluate every aspect > Know Thy Target

 

 

Below is the current list of Principals:

 

There is No Silver Bullet

Think Strategically, Not Tactically

The SDLC is King

Test Early and Test Often

Understand the Scope

Mindset 

Know Thy Target

Use the Right Tools

The Devil is in the Details

Use The Source Code When Possible

    Develop Metrics 

 

 

Proposed List:

 

There is No Silver Bullet

Think Strategically, Not Tactically

The SDLC is King

Test Early and Test Often

Understand the Scope

Mindset 

Know Thy Target

Use the Right Tools

Use The Source Code When Possible

    Develop Metrics 

 

 

- Carl

This should flow better as per Jeff's comments. I will complete the 
Threat Modeling section later today.

have pertaining to the 'Principals' at this point...which are pretty raw in
some cases.  I have cleared my calendar over the next couple days so that I
can actively work on these and hopefully wrap'em up for the most part if not
completely this week (final draft).  I sincerely welcome any suggestions,
recommendations, etc.  
 
Personally, I'm not very happy with my current 'SDLC is King' writings after
re-reading NIST 800-64 per Mark's suggestion.

Works for me. Feel free to edit the last draft I sent out. I won't be
touching it for the next 18 hours.

Gentlemen,
 
By my count (latest draft sent out) we currently have a total of 11
Principles.  I would like to suggest chucking "The Devil is in the Details"
heading and redistributing the current sub-bullets to other 'Principals' as
follows if there are no objections:
 

            -            Weed out false positives > Use the Right Tools

            -            Thoroughly explore logic in an attempt to expose
flaws > Use The Source Code When Possible

            -            Look for discrete vulnerabilities > Use The Source
Code When Possible

            -            Become intimate with the application > Know Thy
Target

            -            Evaluate every aspect > Know Thy Target

 

 

Below is the current list of Principals:

 

There is No Silver Bullet

Think Strategically, Not Tactically

The SDLC is King

Test Early and Test Often

Understand the Scope

Mindset 

Know Thy Target

Use the Right Tools

The Devil is in the Details

Use The Source Code When Possible

    Develop Metrics 

 

 

Proposed List:

 

There is No Silver Bullet

Think Strategically, Not Tactically

The SDLC is King

Test Early and Test Often

Understand the Scope

Mindset 

Know Thy Target

Use the Right Tools

Use The Source Code When Possible

    Develop Metrics

This should flow better as per Jeff's comments. I will complete the 
Threat Modeling section later today.
