Subject: [Owasp-testing] [Testing guide v4] Paragraph redundancy
Message-ID: <CACHzbgb-cJQe9L_Cew9u64oMTSSs79OgW_JBEHoDouFDv+aFcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I just got into the v4 of the OWASP Testing Guide, and couldn't help but
notice a slight redundancy : on page 11, the 2nd column's first paragraph
is included twice (starting with "While estimating the cost of insecure..."
and ending with  "See [4] for more information about some of these
efforts.".

Hope I chose the right place to send this.

BR.
