Good.

I had the impression a high level view was needed. In any case, 
wouldn't it be best if we completed all the different items in Part 2 
(since it seems that some did not provide the sections asked for) and, 
when all the different items are finished (even if at a high-level) 
work in detailing each one?

That way OWASP could provide a high-level view for Part 2, and ask for 
contributors/reviews while we were working for a more detailed 
document.....
