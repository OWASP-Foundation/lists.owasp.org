<PRE>Javier,

We could. What seems to have happened with  many projects is;

Lots of volunteers
most never do anything
Pm's always fail us
General quality of submissions is poor

That leaves me having to deal with the mails, the work that was promised and the general admin. I just dont have capacity or motivation. i decided a while back its more effective to just write it rather than talk about writing it so thats what i am doing. Part 1 is almost complete...i am sorry past experience affects u a new guys but we would just not get anything done if we operated in the old way....that said if you write a detailled how to for a topic it will get used either on testing or as a whiepaper so pls, get typing and be creative !

    &gt; Dan,
    &gt; 
    &gt; At a high level we decided to split it into two main sections. Part
    &gt; 1 for the How, What and Why of testing, covering the types of
    (...)
    
    Good.
    
      &gt; The work that came in for section 2 the How to Test for specific
    &gt; issues needs some work so we can work towards this later say May.
    &gt; One of the challenges was that the work that came in was all
    &gt; focused on pen testing and at a pretty high level. I think that was
    &gt; my fault for supplying a small temaplate and no example but it
    &gt; needs work. Give us a few weeks to get Part 1 out and we can all
    &gt; focus on each section. oFlow is in testing which will help a lot.
    
    I had the impression a high level view was needed. In any case, 
    wouldn't it be best if we completed all the different items in Part 2 
    (since it seems that some did not provide the sections asked for) and, 
    when all the different items are finished (even if at a high-level) 
    work in detailing each one?
    
    That way OWASP could provide a high-level view for Part 2, and ask for
