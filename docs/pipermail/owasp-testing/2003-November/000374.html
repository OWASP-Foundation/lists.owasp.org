<PRE>Hi Mark

Thanks for your feedback -- see my responses below.

What is the process for peer review? Shall I revise my bits and resubmit
them?

Cheers
Dafydd

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hi Dafydd,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is a great start. I have a few suggestions / comments 
</I>&gt;<i>that may be worth
</I>&gt;<i>considering ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Default Files
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. In the description I think it may be worth accentuating the 
</I>&gt;<i>fact that
</I>&gt;<i>there is only a security issue in default files when they have security
</I>&gt;<i>vulns. One of my pet peeves are consultants reports listing 
</I>&gt;<i>default files
</I>&gt;<i>like documentation etc where there is no security issues at all. It's a
</I>&gt;<i>housekeeping issue (I guess) but not a security one in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed -- there's nothing like trying to talk up a non-issue when you
haven't found anything decent :)


&gt;<i>2. In the &quot;how to test&quot; description I think it would be worth-while
</I>&gt;<i>explaining that you are looking for the instance of the file. 
</I>&gt;<i>To do that you
</I>&gt;<i>need to see an HTTP 200 or equivalent server response and this is
</I>&gt;<i>essentially what tools like Nikto etc do. Maybe a http trace 
</I>&gt;<i>type sequence
</I>&gt;<i>might be a good visual example....That leads neatly onto ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed. I mentioned this briefly in the Unreferenced Files section, but it
should be spelled out more fully in both.


&gt;<i>3. IMHO tools like Nikto and Nessus are really bad at finding 
</I>&gt;<i>default files.
</I>&gt;<i>That is because they can't tell the difference between an HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i>404 (or 400
</I>&gt;<i>series server response) from a HTTP 200 carrying an HTML 404. 
</I>&gt;<i>As an example
</I>&gt;<i>fire one of them off against OWASP.org and you'll find we have 
</I>&gt;<i>all the IIS
</I>&gt;<i>files under the sun (on a Unix box!). The commercial scanners 
</I>&gt;<i>have solved
</I>&gt;<i>this by allowing users to define a 404.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, Nessus does some basic 200 &quot;not found&quot; detection (and does it better
than one commercial scanner I've used!) but it isn't too clever. We should
list a few commercial tools as well.


&gt;<i>4. I am not sure white box and black box are good terms for this on
</I>&gt;<i>reflection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>5. How about tools like IIS lockdown that look for and remove 
</I>&gt;<i>sample files ?
</I>&gt;<i>Is there an Apache equiv anyone knows about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not aware of one.


&gt;<i>Unreferenced Files
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. This write up focuses solely on pen testing. How about comparing the
</I>&gt;<i>deployed content to the CMS or app deployment tool? This is 
</I>&gt;<i>typically what
</I>&gt;<i>happens in enterprises in my experience. Maybe we should say 
</I>&gt;<i>that this is
</I>&gt;<i>really a pen testing technique only ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2. Under blind guessing might be worth mentioning the HTTP / 
</I>&gt;<i>HTML 404 again.
</I>&gt;<i>Great stuff though!
</I>
Agreed -- I'll spell out this point, with some techniques for automating
detection of 200 &quot;not found&quot; pages.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3. I used to have a list of mutated extensions like ~bak from 
</I>&gt;<i>Vi and so on
</I>&gt;<i>(that's wrong, I even forgot that). Maybe we could create that 
</I>&gt;<i>list as an
</I>&gt;<i>appendix and we could build that into WebScarab. A simple XML 
</I>&gt;<i>format would
</I>&gt;<i>be good such as 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;extension&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>	&lt;fileext/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>	&lt;appthatcreatesit/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;/extension&gt;
</I>
Agreed


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>4. Might be worth showing an example of making an HTTP call to list the
</I>&gt;<i>directory contents where no default page for that dir has been 
</I>&gt;<i>specified ?
</I>
Agreed


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyways great job, just a few thoughts I had !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Cheers
