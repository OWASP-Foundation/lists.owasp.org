Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] nag nag nag - comments please
Message-ID: <B0EE7658D55FD411AE3A00508BC253EE5570E5@mariana.corsaire.com>

Hi,

I started looking at Chapter 4 in line with Dave's original "release1.zip"
mail of 21/3 & the release deadline of today.  Luckily, you guys are 5 to 8
hours behind, so my 11th hour response is a little earlier in your day!

I agree that chapters 3 and 4 have some crossover - particularly in choosing
the appropriate testing methodology.  

For example, an external audit driven requirement may require specific
targeted areas to be assessed from an operational perspective in order to
attain a certification or licence.  An application assessment driven by a
due-diligence desire may have a much broader scope.

Perhaps Chapter 3 should evolve into 'why assess?' and 'how to assess'
sections.  "How" would clearly be derived from "Why", and then lead into
"How" in the next chapter - "The OWASP methodology".

However the structure settles, I have attached updated drafts of the
existing Chapter 4 - The OWASP Methodology.

The intent with this draft is to provide a structure for future debate,
based on the existing guide draft, whilst allowing for plenty of fleshing
out as time goes on.  ** It is destined and expected to change in response
to debate in the list **

For example, the "Application Implementation Review and Testing" is clearly
a broad subject at this stage, and will undoubtedly yield as many
sub-headings as the preceding phases put together.

Comments craved,
Glyn.

PS. Apologies for the multi-format post, but there seem to be a few
different user requirements out there!

Attached is Section 1, edited and incorporating many of your suggestions.  I
feel the beginning section of "What is a web application" still needs a
little work, or needs to be deleted altogether and referenced to the Guide
instead.  Once Ivan Arce, our project advisor, blessses this draft, we will
post it and move on to the next section!  Basing the quality of the doc on
the first section alone, I feel we are going to produce something very
powerful at the end of our efforts.  Thanks again to everyone contributing
thus far.

Argh. . I forgot we have some new members, the file I sent is in OpenOffice

The eventual final formats once we post it will be in pretty HTML format on

DocBook rendering is working now on the portal. You will be able to see
HTML in-line and pull down html and pdf's by chapter or as a whole.
Power of web apps eh ;-)

It will go out next week without the user auth and forums enabled but
with the RSS news feeds.

Hiya,

I think that in Phase II, pp15, the Implementation Review and Testing phase
needs to be chopped in two.

1/  Infrastructure testing (e.g. os/web server implementation, default
scripts etc.)
2/  "Proper" Application testing (e.g. input validation, authentication &
authorisation, bounds checking etc.)

Reason being that in many organisations I've provided consultancy too,
different teams and responsibilities exist relating to the two.  In keeping
with the pick and mix approach of the OWASP Testing Guide - to provide a
'best approach' but reflect the reality of test scope, I feel its better to
differentiate.

E.g.

* Application Infrastructure Review and Testing
This section is focussed on the underlying hosts and software supporting the
web application, and potential security flaws.  This phase crosses over
heavily with traditional penetration testing.  It focuses on design problems
and security vulnerabilities with the deployment of the hosts, operating
systems, web and database servers on which the application relies.  This
phase will also identify insecure or unnecessary application components,
such as vulnerable CGI scripts or inappropriate services or functionality.

* Application Implementation Review and Testing 
The section is to assess the security of the web-application, typically from
a user's perspective.  During this Application Security Assessment the
correct operation of the site will be analysed from a security perspective.
Compliance with the web application operational and security design will be
assessed, together with broader categories such as Authentication and
Session Management, Parameter Manipulation and Input Validation is assessed
in this stage.

Cheers,
G

Hi Glyn and Dan,

I actually went back and forth on this issue and decided on the larger
subset of "Implementation Testing" for a couple of reasons:

1.)  I think as you define "Infrastructure Testing", it is very easily
handled in a few paragraphs that mentions "Looking for Known
System/Hardware/Application Vulnerabilities" and "Analyzing Infrastructure
Dependencies" (router rules, firewall ACLs, primary DNS servers, etc.).

2.) I didn't want us to get too bogged down in "penetration testing" as
there are countless other sources on this that we can reference. 

I am more than open to being swayed back the other way :-)

Anyone else have an opinion?

Hiya,

I totally agree that we need to keep traditional pen-testing out of the
app testing guide.  It should perhaps be mentioned that application
testing is not intended to replace vulnerability identification within
the OS's, web-servers, app-server platforms etc., but to compliment it.

I feel the confusion comes in where you draw the line between the two.
The crossover we frequently see is in the area of deployment of the
shrink-wrapped parts (up to and including web-server components) as they
relate to the app.  E.g. web-server configuration and hardening,
middleware configuration, database security....

Some clients feel that checking for *known* vulnerable CGI's, for
example, is appropriate in an application test, even though this is more
a deployment issue.  Others want the testing focussed on the bespoke
application logic regardless of the platform.  It's not to say that the
underlying checks won't be performed, just that they may not be relevant
in the context of the specific phase of testing.

My feeling is that by separating the two it is clearer to readers of the
document that, whilst deployment of the application support components
is important, it is separate from testing of the bespoke web-app and can
be tested separately.  We tend to look at the profile of the teams we're
going to be dealing with to help define the scope.  If it's the coders
and app developers, chance are the focus should be on input validation,
session management, authentication etc.  If it's the guys that build the
servers, the focus is probably on making sure the servers are patched
appropriately, and unnecessary features removed/disabled.  Sometimes its
both.

We could even qualify the infrastructure phase accordingly - e.g. add a
line that says "This is arguably infrastructure pen-testing and
therefore may be out of scope of this document.  It is included,
however, as it is a vital stage in assuring the application environment
is secure"

Debaters - prepare to debate ;)

My experience in Canada has been completely the opposite but of course
most of my clients are just now starting to understand application
security.  Of course, I am not saying that this is the best way to do
things separate teams is definitely the way to go here.

Hi there,

Unfortunately, the OWASP portal guys are running a little behind schedule.
Instead of posting our first section of the doc to the old site, we wanted
to show it on the new fresh portal.  I'll send out the next section for
edits this week.

Message-ID: <1051311286.1071.11336.camel@localhost.localdomain>

The OWASP portal will go live May 9th.

If you have contributed to an OWASP project, please go to the CVS module
"portal" and add your details to the contributors.xml file. 

When the user management is turned on you will be able to do this
automatically and add a personal page about yourself, however for this
release its a manual process.

Many thanks.

Mark

Has everyone had an opportunity to look at the various files that we've 
setup in the CVS for content?
