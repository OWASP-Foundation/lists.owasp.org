<PRE>
&gt;<i> Hi folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m about to get going on the OWASP Guide 3.0 &#8211; I&#8217;ve sent a message  
</I>&gt;<i> a few weeks ago and have a few volunteers. For the next version,  
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;d like to have parity in both, and to do that is a bit of work.  
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things to help progress is to set a date. I propose the  
</I>&gt;<i> following schedule:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP US Conference is October this year. Gives us six months
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP EU Conference is May next year. Gives us twelve months
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we can have a 2.5 edition by October, and a 3.0 by next  
</I>&gt;<i> year. What do folks think? I personally do not have the time I once  
</I>&gt;<i> did, so basically I&#8217;d prefer the 12 month schedule and get things  
</I>&gt;<i> right the first time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed, this time-scale seems acheivable

&gt;<i> There&#8217;s a lot of testing material in the OWASP Guide, which I would  
</I>&gt;<i> like to selectively dump into the Testing Guide. This will give you  
</I>&gt;<i> feature parity with the Guide, and in turn, I need to pick up a few  
</I>&gt;<i> of the things in the Testing Guide for the Guide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Spring cleanout!

&gt;<i> In the Testing Guide 3.0, please make room for an authorization  
</I>&gt;<i> section. This was missed (how?) in 2.0. The basics will include a  
</I>&gt;<i> few things in already in the Testing Guide 2.0, and a few things  
</I>&gt;<i> from the OWASP Guide, but will at the very least encompass:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> Complete mediation &#8211; everything is access controlled
</I>&gt;<i> Forced Browsing. We&#8217;re settling on this term as WASC are also  
</I>&gt;<i> starting to use it. This is where a pre-constructed request (GET,  
</I>&gt;<i> POST, whatever) is sent to the browser and it works. This is  
</I>&gt;<i> typical of hidden / optional links and buttons common in most programs
</I>&gt;<i> CSRF
</I>&gt;<i> Course grained authorization - isAuthenticated(), which is  
</I>&gt;<i> typically all products like SiteMinder and WebSeal tell you unless  
</I>&gt;<i> you start using their advanced features. This is insufficient
</I>&gt;<i> Medium grained authorization (isUserInRole()). Could be considered  
</I>&gt;<i> business logic access control
</I>&gt;<i> Fine grained authorization (is the current secured resource record  
</I>&gt;<i> or current secured function sub-feature OK for the current user).  
</I>&gt;<i> Could be considered data layer access control.
</I>&gt;<i> Architecture to incorporate authZ checks at the client,  
</I>&gt;<i> presentation, business and data layers. This is important with Ajax  
</I>&gt;<i> applications (I&#8217;ve seen this issue this very week. I can&#8217;t go into  
</I>&gt;<i> details, but it is end of application class of attack).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Will add this to the page

&gt;<i> Dave Wichers wants all the Guides to be in what I call &#8220;SFA&#8221;  
</I>&gt;<i> format. When I complete the injection chapter, I&#8217;ll demonstrate  
</I>&gt;<i> what needs to happen here. Luckily, your content is closer to this  
</I>&gt;<i> format than the Guide. However, SFA favors Wiki than documents. For  
</I>&gt;<i> many, the Wiki is the way to go, and I agree ... When you&#8217;re  
</I>&gt;<i> online. But many folks like it being in printed form and that also  
</I>&gt;<i> helps when you&#8217;re doing a review where you&#8217;re not allowed to use  
</I>&gt;<i> your own computer or the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm in Australia this week, so will create the wiki entry and also  
start the process

&gt;<i> Dinis and myself are looking for a decent publisher now. I&#8217;ve set a  
</I>&gt;<i> few minimum standards to ensure that OWASP materials in published  
</I>&gt;<i> form do not lose us our copyright and gain us maximum funds whilst  
</I>&gt;<i> allowing us to keep the Wiki / PDF versions around for free. Most  
</I>&gt;<i> publishers will not touch this and therefore, we need to choose  
</I>&gt;<i> from the remaining publishers carefully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Andrew
