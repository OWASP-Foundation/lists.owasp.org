<PRE>Hi there,

I am happy to announce that the Guide 2.0 has been finished. It is  
rendering now on my PC. It is 278 pages long and will weigh in around  
2 MB once it has finished being fully tagged by Acrobat in an hour or  
so's time.

The upload will be on SourceForge within the hour, but please don't  
make any public noises as yet. Feel free to tell friends who might be  
interested in getting an early copy, but please no Slashdot  
submissions or similar until Wednesday morning. If there is to be  
press (and I hope there is), can those efforts be coordinated by   
Jeff Williams rather than everyone making  independent efforts. Jeff  
- could you get a PR together for Wednesday morning?

I have incorporated as many corrections as is possible, but I am  
certain that there are bugs and issues to be found. These will be  
fixed in 2.0.1 in a few week's time taking into account some time for  
people to digest and peer review the content. Version 2.1 will be  
even better as we work with No Starch Press who are allocating us an  
actual editor! With some luck, the NSP book will be out in November  
or December. I will keep the Guide list informed of our progress with  
No Starch.

I wish to thank everyone who has helped make the Guide 2.0 a reality,  
including early authors who may not necessarily be with us today.

thanks,
Andrew
