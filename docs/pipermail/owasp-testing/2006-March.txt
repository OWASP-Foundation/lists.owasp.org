Hey all,

Due to various factors (me gradually retiring from IT security and  
moving into a new career), I'm passing over the leadership of the  
testing phase.

Eoin Keary will be heading it up now and cracking the whip, and I'll  
be here in the background helping out where i can

Would just like to say a quick thanks for everyone who has helped so  
far!

Daniel

Hello,
I have compiled the submissions from all contributors below.
The Authors of some of the documents are unknown, if you are one of them 
drop me a line.

The documents also need to be reviewed for content initially. The second 
stage is to format them.
SO..... We need volunteers to review the documentation....help appreciated.
Thanks,
Eoin

I can format the documentation using the Guide template (which is now  
far improved from the 2.0 template) if you can give me exclusive  
access to the materials over the weekend.

thanks,

Andrew,

   Would it be better to wait until we have all the sections written
then format it?  Or are you okay with doing some now, some later as
they're written?

Answer inline:

It is worthwhile noticing that this section includes text provided by
Dafydd Stuttard (written way back in the first attempt to release the 
guide, in october 2003). Which I pointed to Mauro Bregolin when he was 
writting the section.

Configuration Management Infrastructure -  Javier Fernandez-Sanguino - 
August, 1st 2005
Includes:
  ?	Known Web Server Vulnerabilities
?	Web application architecture (investigating/discovering components 
such as  application servers, DBMSs, other back-end applications, etc.)
?	Access and visibility of administrative tools of web, application, etc 
servers.
?	Authentication back-ends (LDAP, DBMS, text files)

Configuration Management Application -  Javier Fernandez-Sanguino, 
August, 1st 2005
Includes:
?	Sample/known files and directories
?	Comment review
?	Configuration review
?	Logging


I sent those in my e-mail [1] dated August the 1st, 2005. The 
"Configuration Management Application" section is missing the following 
subsections: Permissions, Unsafe modules, HTML and hidden form fields, 
Error handling and page analysis and Process permissions. As I said,  I 
wanted to review the writing style of the other submissions before doing 
this. I did not receive any feedback on that submission and, since I 
didn't see any master document with all the other submissions, didn't 
know wether my style fitted in properly or I need to change it to adapt 
to others.

That being said, I'd be willing to review the current master document.

Regards

Javier

Hello Eoin,

I would gladly help reviewing one or more of the following chapters:

- OS Injection
- Weak Password Self-Reset Testing
- Sensitive data in URL
- Default or Guessable User Accounts and Empty Passwords
- authentication.doc

Hi Eoin,

I compiled a session management section a while back - that may be  
the one you're referring to below (sent in an off-list mail).

I'm happy to pick up a proof read of any of the sections that are  
more black-box/client-side app assessment rather than code review.

Cheers,
Glyn.

Hi Eoin,
I'd like to partecipate in reviewing the drafts.

So how many paragraphs of the original "OWASP Testing Guide Section
Two Outline (final draft"are not completeted in this moment?

Thanks,
Mat

Hi,
Attached is a copy of the Testing Guide structure.
Its a little old but a good start anyways.

There are many outstanding documents to be submitted by contributors. The
names of these contributors are written beside each section.
Some sections are marked completed.

1. Can anyone that has completed sections and the document does not say
"[Completed]" please drop me a line (This email address). Also send me their
latest version.

2. With any non completed/outstanding sections can those people tell me if
they are still going to complete these sections . If not tell me also. If
document is completed please send it to me.

3. There are sections that have no names If you wish to write one of these
sections drop me a line and inform me.


rename file to .zip
In general I want to cover all the sections. See what needs to be done. And
assign content reviewers.
Thanks
Eoin. (OWASP Ireland + Test Project Lead)

A lot of the session related stuff is in the doc I sent you a few  
days back, but it does need fresh eyes and some updates.

I'm willing to review that part as I've done extensive application 
review recently and we devoted some time to define how to test for 
proper session management.

Eoin, please notice that maybe the following should be included as 
'Completed' (or maybe pending review)

Authentication
[ ... ]
?	Session token transport security and reuse of session tokens from HTTP 
to HTTPS []
?	Session hijacking [ ]
?	Session replay [ ]
?	Session manipulation [ ]
?	Inactivity timeout [ ]
?	Activity timeout [ ]
?	Expiration at logoff [ ]
?	Session token expiry [ ]


Regards

Javier

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] [Owasp-world] Reminder: 2006 European OWASP AppSec Conference - May 30-31, 2006 near Brussels
Message-ID: <02db01c650e0$f9251050$1204a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is holding its annual European AppSec (Application Security)
Conference May 30-31, 2006 at the Catholic University of Leuven (aka
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or K.U. Leuven) in Leuven, which is 25 km
from Brussels.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES: Early registration for the conference ends April 30.
The reduced rates for the conference hotels ends mid to late April depending
on the hotel.

AGENDA: This conference has dual tracks like last years' US conference. The
speakers and agenda are available on the OWASP website at:

             http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html.

This year's speakers include popular speakers from previous conferences like
Dinis Cruz and Ivan Ristic, but also includes many new speakers to the OWASP
Conference, including Andrew Van Der Stock (project lead for the OWASP
Guide), Roger Thornton (CTO of Fortify), Mike Andrews of Foundstone, and
myself (Dave Wichers - COO of Aspect Security).

NEW: We also have introduced for the first time two panels, which should
generate some lively debate. The first panel is on "Should companies be
emulating Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)?" and the 2nd is
on: "Are we winning the war?" - Are we actually getting a handle on
application security issues and making things better, or are things still
getting worse?

REGISTRATION DETAILS: Registration is open and the conference fee is 300
Euros for early registration and 350 Euros for registrations after April 30,
2006.

TUTORIALS - May 29, 2006:

OWASP has arranged to have two one-day tutorials the day prior to the
conference. These one day tutorials will be held at the university and are
only 600 Euros for conference attendees.

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE: This powerful hands on course
focuses on the most common web application security problems, including the
OWASP Top Ten. The course introduces and demonstrates hacking techniques,
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students
really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code. 

WEB SERVICES and XML SECURITY: The movement towards Web Services and Service
Oriented architecture (SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to
deal with new risks posed by these architectures. This session takes a
pragmatic approach towards identifying Web Services security risks and
selecting and applying countermeasures to the application, code, web
servers, databases, application, and identity servers and related software.

More details on these training courses are available at:

        http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/training.html 

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - May 30, 2006: The traditional evening dinner/social
event is being held at the nearby Faculty Club. The Faculty club is a
restaurant annex conference centre located in a medieval part of Leuven. We
can walk there from the conference, and will have a social hour followed by
a 3-course dinner. Dinner is typically followed by drinks nearby. The dinner
event is 40 Euros.

HOTELS - We have arranged for conference rates at nearby hotels. Many of
these rates expire mid to late April, so please book early. More information
is available at:

 
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/accommodations.html 

If you know others that would be interested in attending this OWASP
conference, please forward them this email and let them know about this
opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Thanks, Dave
