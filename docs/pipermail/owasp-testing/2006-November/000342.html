Subject: FW: [OWASP-TESTING] Sign up list and Template


web view cvs sometimes take a while to update. It is there now and you
are signed up sir ! Thanks.
 
I have also taken transport security. I have a pretty good technique
using OpenSSL to test SSL algorithms, available key lengths and
certificates validity and properties.

Mark,
 
    I didn't see any files on sourceforge.net under the testing project,
though I may not have been in the correct place. If no one has signed up
for 'Parameter Manipulation', please mark me down for it.
 
Thanks,
Jim

	Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Sign up list and Template

	OK folks, in the CVS under a module called testing are two
files. One is a
	sign-up list to write up how to test specific issues and the
other a very
	basic HTML template. 
	
	If you are interested in participating please let Penny Major or
myself know
	what you would like to write up and we will update the list.
First come
	first served. As always copyright will be FSF and released under
GPL. If you
	haven't signed up to write up anything by  Sunday we are going
to cull this
	list as it is for active participants and this project is now
officially
	active ;-) All write-ups should be complete within a month and
be no more
	than 2,500 words. Penny and I will then piece this together with
the into
	etc and create a first draft. Please ensure the how to test is
not just
	black box testing. If you aren't sure about code analysis or
other ways to
	test, mail the list and ask for help.
	
	If you can't or don't do CVS the files are attached.
	
	Lets go !
