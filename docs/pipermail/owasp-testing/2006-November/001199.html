&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I just started to review the Testing Guide Wiki today, seen as yesterday 
</I>&gt;<i> was the end date for submission of the different chapters.
</I>&gt;<i> One section is &quot;Web application Penetration Testing&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the introduction there is a question: &quot;What is a vulnerability?&quot; Seen 
</I>&gt;<i> as this is a topic that everyone has a different opinion about, does 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone want to give some suggestions on what a vulnerability is?
</I>
There is a good definition in CVE for what constitutes a vulnerability. 
This was discussed at lenght in at CVE's board mailing list and their 
definitions are exposed in their website.

IIRC their definition is &quot;a vulnerability is a flaw that violates the 
security policy all/most organisations should have&quot; (i.e. it violates 
policies which are closely related to CIA issues: Confidentiality, 
Integrity, Availability). A vulnerability needs not be exploitable to be 
considered as such and might not lead to a system (or application 
compromise).

An &quot;exposure is a flaw that violates the security policy of *some* 
organisations&quot;. This disctintion is needed because some vulnerabilities 
might be considered as such for some organisations (like the web server 
of a Bank providing accurate information of the software it is running) 
but not for some other organisations (like a University).

Exposure is, commonly, associated with the revelation of internal 
information and it can be related to default web-server related 
functions in OWASP content. For example, the server-status / server-info 
feature in Apache might, or might not, be considered a vulnerability in 
some organisations and it is part of web server best practices to remove 
it, but some organisations might not consider it a security issue 
because that information being available fits their security policy just 
fine.
