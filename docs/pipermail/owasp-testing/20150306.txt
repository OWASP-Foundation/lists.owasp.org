Andrew,
Can you direct me to the discussion(s) from June 2014 until http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2015-February/014992.html related to the demotion and reinstatement of the [Flagship] status [v2] please as I am interested to know what the changes (if any) were made to the Testing Guide after release?

Regards,cmlh.id.au/contact
