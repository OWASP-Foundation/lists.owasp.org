Hi all,

Sorry I was AWOL for a while, i went on an impromptu and extended trip to
Croatia which I will be glad to explain over a beer the next time you are in
the Washington, DC area.  The pictures are even more entertaining.  At any
rate, I apologize for yet another delay in the publication of the document.
In general, I've been making lots of changes with the philosophy that we
need more method, and less technique for now in the initial draft.  I thank
those of you who sent me updated versions of your sections based on my
requests. 

I'd like to hand off the next version to the group with my changes for one
more sanity check next week.  If we deem it worthy enough for a release,
then I'm thinking end of month once all the i's are dotted.  Thanks for
being patient through this lengthy editorial process.

Hi and welcome back David.

Speaking of travels, I am currently in Buenos Aires, Argentina
where my company's R&D labs are located.

I just got a telephone call from a journalist of a local newspaper
El Cronista Comercial http://www.cronista.com/) who asked some
questions in reference to OWASP's top ten. Somehow it the release
of the 'top ten' document got his attention and he is writing about
it and a bit about OWASP itself in their IT supplement due out next
Tuesday. It will be a small piece but none the less it just surprised
me how news travel so fast and proves that there is people all over
the world watching us and looking at the project's output.

Thats so true. Today I got a call from a press company interested in
publishing the OWASP work under Gnu FDL. I'll keep you all updated but
its getting real attention. Today we were on Business Week, Government
Computer News, CNET, ZDNet and the Register to name but a few. 

Also take a look at http://news.google.com and type in OWASP. Its been
an amazing day. People seem to have a huge appetite for what we are
doing.

Ivan, you're based in Boston? I am moving there in April, I can finally
buy you a beer !

I just moved from NH to atlanta. Boston is a great place. Here are a few places you have
to check out.

Hardvard square, kenmore, and government center. 
(All off the red line on the T with government on green/red intersection)

At hardvard square you gotta try a place called "the wrap". It has decent fruit shakes and wraps (food wrapped in something like a soft taco with rice, chicken, etc..)

Oh did I mention boston is expensive? :p

I mean't in the USA. We all know the UK gov doesn't care of people have money or not :p
I thought about moving there once but spoke to a few people who lived thre. It ended up being
way to expensive to even be worth it.
