 Hi,
So far, so good as the man says....

The OWASP Testing guide is shaping up real well.
Many documents are of high quality and new sections have been introduced
such as the Oracle testing section complements of NGS (David Litchfield),
thanks to our  tech lead Matteo!!!

We now have a final push to complete the guide in its current form by the
31/12/2006. This is the end date for the AoC project.
So,.....
If there is any documentation left to do can you dedicate a couple of hours
to finish your doc off?

If you have a couple of hours can you read an unreviewed document? Review
status can be found here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Review_Panel

I'd like to thank Matteo for his great work so far in the Autumn of
Code lead role and also all of you who have taken time and effort to
contribute and update to the new Testing guide.

Once the AoC is over please feel free to continue to contribute to the guide
as this is an ever changing/organic document.

In the new year we hope to integrate the guide more closely with some of the
new projects, one idea is to integrate the testing guide with the ORG (OWASP
Report Generator).

Thanks

Eoin

I am taking care of the 4.5.5 chapter (HTTP Exploit). It should be done
in a few days.

Hi James,
You can edit if its not too big of a change (Not a rewrite or restructure).
And also add to the review panel page the issues found.

Otherwise if the change is large in your opinion just add to the review
panel page and Metteo or I shall take a look at your comments.

Thanks,
Eoin

Hi,

Do we agree that the Oracle testing section should be in the Datavalidation
testing section?
There is an element of SQL injection in the document but there are other
topics also like ACL bypass etc...

Hi Eoin,

 

It seems out of place there to me.  To me this is part of
testing/verifying connections to backend systems.  And we should
eventually have articles not just about Oracle, but about other
directories, databases, web services, etc... So I suggest we make a new
chapter called "Backend System Testing" and put those articles there.

 

While we're at it, I also suggest taking all the injection articles and
making a new chapter called "Interpreter Injection Testing" - this will
match the structure of "The Guide" better.

 

And could somebody point me to the section on testing access control?  I
know it's got to be there, but I can't find it. But we should have
articles on testing direct object references, whether forced browsing is
possible, business-logic access control testing, and searching for
presentation-layer only access control.

 

Thanks!

 

--Jeff

Hey all,
Alberto and I think that the Stored Procedure Injection paragraph is
very close to SQL Injection par. and maybe we can merge it. Testing
methods are nearly the same. What do you think about that?

True. It can also be used to detect elements inline which need to 
per-session tracking and avoid sending users to different backend 
servers. Nortel's Application Switch (formerly Alteon), Arrowpoint, F5's 
BIG-IPs and others do this.

I did not pursue this much, attached is my latest version of the file. 
If you do some Google research on this subject you can probably fill it 
up more.

Thanks for updating that document.

True. It can also be used to detect elements inline which need to
per-session tracking and avoid sending users to different backend
servers. Nortel's Application Switch (formerly Alteon), Arrowpoint, F5's

BIG-IPs and others do this.

I did not pursue this much, attached is my latest version of the file.
If you do some Google research on this subject you can probably fill it
up more.

(http://z.iwethey.org/forums/render/content/show?contentid=273077 )

PHPSESSION : session identifier for PHP.
ASP.NET_Sessionid : session identifier for ASP.NET
__utma, __utmb, __utmc, __utmv : Urchin Tracking Module (I see these a
lot)
sc_id, s_sq, s_sess (probably others) : Omniture (I see these a lot,
too) - they own 2o7.net, FWIW
BIGipServer* : BigIP load balancer from F5? (I thought they were a
network like Akamai)
CP=null* : no idea, yet I see it a lot
he=lo : also no idea
bblastactivity, bblastvisit (probably others) : some sort of bulletin
board software 
T3CK : no idea. I see this one a fair bit, too.
MintUnique, Mint* : again, I dunno, but I see it from time to time.
WEBTRENDS_ID : I imagine this is probably WebTrends.

The MintUnique and Mint* stuff come from a (fairly nice, if you're just
looking for personal use) stats package called Mint [*]. It's popular
among the web-design crowd. 


I know the __utm* and the s_* cookies are for tracking website usage.
The basic way they work is to give you a uniqueID and then see what
pages you load from that site with it. This data is used to see which
pages are popular, which links are more often followed, how often people
come back to the site, and so on. There's more to it than that, of
course, but that's the purpose. Of course, there are a lot of people who
don't understand that's what those cookies are for, or don't want to be
individually tracked, or don't like cookies generally, so such
statistics have high error margins. I see a lot of sites use several
methods, perhaps for this reason.

Abstract:       A method and system for inserting and examining Cookies
in the data streams of HTTP connections for the purpose of persistently
directing HTTP connections to the same destination. The invention
enables a network device to direct subsequent HTTP connections from the
same client to the same server (destination) for accessing the requested
resources. There are four modes for employing the Cookie to persistently
direct HTTP connections. The associative mode inserts a Cookie that
uniquely identifies the client into an HTTP response. The passive mode
inserts Cookie information that uniquely identifies a previously
selected destination into an HTTP response. In the rewrite mode, a
network device manages the destination information that is rewritten
over blank Cookie information generated by the destination producing the
HTTP response. The insert mode inserts and removes Cookie information in
the data packets for HTTP requests and responses prior to processing by
the destination.

I agree,
we can put this on line and add a link to this page from the Web
Application Fingerprint section.
Javier what do you think about that?

Sure. I wasn't aware of the OWASP cookie database. I will add all my 
info there.

Ok. I've added all my cookies there. The problem is that the table 
format does not accomodate well for cookie examples, specially for 
cookies that store too much information there.

Please take a look and tell me what you think.

Is the article this one: 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Web_Application_Fingerprint
?

If so I think it would be good to:

- Reference hmap (it was the first OSS application I know of that 
implemented behaviour-based HTTP fingerprinting). The main page is 
http://ujeni.murkyroc.com/hmap/
and the thesis is available at 
http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/papers/hmap-thesis.pdf

- Reference Nessus' hmap NASL script. Which is much more up-to-date and 
accurate (includes many more new references). It is available at 
http://www.nessus.org/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=11919

- (This is rather obvious, but might fit) Notice that some servers 
maintain the original 'favicon.ico' files distributed by thhe vendor. 
Those icon files can be used to distinguish between different webservers 
(and even web server versions). Check out the Nessus NASL plugin #20108 
(http://www.nessus.org/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=20108) and the 
attached .ico examples.

This is very cool. We should probably alphabetize it someday, but it's
not critical.  I think for super-long cookies, perhaps we should maybe
just put the first 40 bytes and then ...  or something like that.

Any HTML gurus out there have any style ideas for fitting this data more
nicely?

Thanks,

Hey all,
here is the progress status of the OWASP Testing Guide.

1) Articles
************
We have merged Stored procedure Injection section with SQL Injection
section. Now we have 73 articles:
- 66 articles are completed (90%)
- 7 article need a last effort to be completed (10%)

Here is the complete list of articles to be completed.
* 4.2.3 Spidering and googling (60%,Tom Brennan, Tom Ryan). Carlo
Pelliccioni is updating it.
* 4.5.5 HTTP Exploit (90%, Arian J.Evans, Alberto Revelli)
* 4.9 AJAX Testing (70%, Dan Cornell, Giorgio Fedon, Stefano Di Paola,
Anush Shetty) Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon are writing it.
 4.9.1 AJAX Vulnerabilities
 4.9.2 How to test AJAX
* 5.1 How to value the real risk (90%, Daniel Cuthbert, Matteo Meucci,
Sebastien Deleersnyder, Marco Morana)
* 5.2 How to write the report of the testing (90% Daniel Cuthbert, Tom Brennan)

2) Review
************
We have to review all the 7 articles.

3) Deadline:16th December: final week!
*********************************************
I remember all that the final deadline is 16th December. If you have

Subject: [Owasp-testing] WebGoat Install on Linux
Message-ID: <mailman.0.1166012687.2274.owasp-testing@lists.owasp.org>

Hey Guys,
 
I'm having a problem getting webgoat up and running on the LiveCD.. Does
anyone have a sample webgoat.sh they can share?
 
I downloaded the debian package tofrodos as I needed dos2unix. 
So I ran dos2unix -d webgoat.sh and the same on the catalina.sh and
startup.sh
 
Now I'm just having the issue in webgoat.sh in regards to my jdk 1.5 home
dir..
 
I was looking at the install instructions on the OWASP projects site but
they don't seem to match up..
 
I'm going to document my process and put it on the OWASP site when it's
complete. 
 
Cheers,
 
JP

I had to tweak it for a fellow worker at the office and we had issues 
with it mixing different JDK's/JVM's (Sun's + others which are packaged 
in Debian). I remember tweaking webgoat.sh and running (multiple times 
'sh -x webgoat.sh' to determine what the culprit was but I don't 
remember right now offhand.

I'll see if I can get that fellow coworker to provide me with the shell 
scripts we changed...

Hi Dan,
please, could you put on line your ideas about this section?
So we can update and review it?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <02E766F69AF6AC48B9CF52ABC0DA11E101DD7838@MERCEDES.utopiasystems.net>

 

The UCLA incident is a good example to discuss Dinis mail about
collaborating with the Web Hacking Incidents Database Project (WHID,
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid) which I lead. 

 

This is a very high profile incident, but we only have tiniest of clues
as to how it was done (from the article Eoin sent: "the hacker used an
unspecified (and as yet undetermined) application vulnerability to gain
access to systems"). In many cases we don't even get this much
information. 

 

WHID lists only incidents that are certain to have occurred due to web
application vulnerabilities, as the goal is to show that these are a
real problem. Others track security incidents in general, defacements,
or information leakage incidents. 

 

I could use your help to get information (just publicly available
please) that ties security incidents to web applications
vulnerabilities.

 

Thanks

As promised, I have expanded this article with the content I wrote years
ago for the project (but formatted it for the wiki). I've added a
reference to the XSS description in the OWAS Guide but this one is more
oriented towards how to test the vulnerability itself.

Please let me know if this is OK for you guys or if it should be rewritten.

Javier

Javier,
You have looked at the old version.

This is the article about XSS for the new OWASP Testing Guide:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross_site_scripting_AoC
If you want you can update the article with your new.
Please refer to:

Thanks,

Oh my, so I did all the work at 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Cross_site_scripting_vulnerabilities 
  for nothing?

At least the references, "White box testing" and "Other factors" can be 
salvaged. I'll try to merge both.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] Defining Risk
Message-ID: <62849532-B56C-49C8-B472-C067E2406EEC@owasp.org>

I've spent today looking at what has been written so far and I feel  
we are venturing into some dangerous territory with what we are  
suggesting.
We need a easy to use, and understand, method of defining risk and  
the one we have at the moment will cause more confusion than good.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_value_the_real_risk_AoC

The section on Quantitative Risk Calculation seems to be heavily  
based upon some complex mathematical formula, but does anyone  
honestly know how to do this?

I've shown this to a number of pentesters and colleagues and they all  
agree that they would not use the above approach as it's overly  
complicated.

Thoughts?

Message-ID: <d2d9d92d0612171555q1a800cc3ka3c74ba79f556ddb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
here is the progress status of the OWASP Testing Guide at 17th Dec.


1) Articles
************
All the articles are completed and reviewed except the following:
* 4.9.2 How to test AJAX (Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon will
update it by tomorrow).
*  5.1 How to value the real risk (we can discuss about it for the next 2 days).

I wish to thanks all of you for the excellent work. I think we have
created an outstanding new OWASP methodology for pen testing.

2) OWASP Testing Guide in pdf
*********************************************
I've created a first draft of the Guide in pdf format. It's nearly 300 pages!
We have done a great work: thank you all!

3) Deadline
*************

Thanks Daniel for pointing this out.  I agree with your comments.  OWASP
has always stood for practical workable solutions and not for too much
theory.  Personally, I've never bought into any methodology that is very
quantitative as there is simply way too much uncertainty in appsec
estimates to make the math work well.

I think the basic process is pretty simple.  Estimate a bunch of factors
and calculate the likelihood, then estimate a few factors and calculate
the business impact.  Then multiply these to get the overall risk.

I believe we should flesh out these factors, show people how to weight
the factors as appropriate for their business, and be done with it.

This process is pretty close to what I'm talking about.

I've spent today looking at what has been written so far and I feel  
we are venturing into some dangerous territory with what we are  
suggesting.
We need a easy to use, and understand, method of defining risk and  
the one we have at the moment will cause more confusion than good.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_value_the_real_risk_AoC

The section on Quantitative Risk Calculation seems to be heavily  
based upon some complex mathematical formula, but does anyone  
honestly know how to do this?

I've shown this to a number of pentesters and colleagues and they all  
agree that they would not use the above approach as it's overly  
complicated.

Thoughts?

I would prefer to review the Guide in PDF format. Since reading a text 
is better for me (working offline) than reading the Wiki. I will not be 
able to provide comments in time for the deadlines issued. But I can 
provide content for version 2 of the Testing Guide.

That said, I will try to improve the XSS section today.

Great work everyone.
Now all we have to do is keep it up to date and work on the code review
guide!!!:0)
thanks everyone that helped out.
We hope to have the PDF of the testing guide on the  Live CD also.

Yep agreed.
One thing I've always hated about assigning risk is to use these formulas
which at times do not take context into account, if the vulnerability is
internal facing only, is it exposed to unauthenticated users or
authenticated only.
There must be a rule of thumb relating to assigning how much of a risk a
particular vulnerability is but avoiding complex academic formulas.

To me Risk is as simple as defining how damaging a vulnerability exploit may
be if exploited and how easy/accessible it is to commit the exploit.
Also taking into account if the vulnerability is externally facing or is it
internal on a "secure" LAN segment?

Hi,

We should maybe take a step back here.

My understanding of testing the security of a web application is that we
try to detect the vulnerabilities. 
For each of the found vulnerabilities we score them: Critical / High /
Medium or Low.

Besides that we should indicate what the related risks are: eg.
Impersonation, DoS. But then calculating these risks depends on the
threats and assets of the web application that is tested. This requires
a threat modeling or risk analysis exercise. If input on Threats and
asset value is available, the risks can be calculated.

In most testing engagements we only rate the found vulnerabilities and
indicate how to integrate this with the risk rating of the customer.

This can be rephrased as:
For each of the found vulnerabilities we score them: Critical / High /
Medium or Low. Based on three major guidelines, but each time with the
vulnerability viewpoint in mind:
*Impact: If the vulnerability is exploited, how serious is the impact on
business operations?
*Ease: What are the impediments to an attacker attempting to exploit the
vulnerability?
*Activity: Are there active attempts under way to exploit the
vulnerability?
The first two guidelines represent a simplified view of the "cost of
attack" and "probability of attack" parameters used in classic risk
assessment methodologies. However, impact focuses on the specific
actions an attacker could take if successful, while ease gauges how much
knowledge and effort would be required on the part of the attacker to be
successful. The third guideline has become increasingly important as
more and more vulnerabilities are discovered.  

It also helps to give examples:

Critical Level: these are the most critical issues and vulnerabilities.
Attackers can gain control over the attacked machine as root or
administrator. These are high vulnerabilities where administrative
access has been obtained on the target.
High Level: these are major issues and vulnerabilities that cause severe
damage. These are vulnerabilities that give intruders the opportunity to
perform the following:
*run arbitrary code on target or to place the target in an unpredictable
state;
*view and modify arbitrary files or parameters on the target;
*impersonate an authorized user or process on the target;
*crash target or cause denial of service.
Medium Level: these are issues and vulnerabilities that cause medium
damage to the customer, without limiting the daily operation of the
customer, allows and attacker to:
*change the content of a web server;
*view specific files with known paths;
*saturate logging and accounting files;
*gain information that can lead to a high or very high  impact attack.
Low Level: these are issues and vulnerabilities which have minor or no
impact for the customer. However, these are bad for the image of the
customer and/or cause an information leakage:
*IP-address of internal machines or internal contact which is displayed
in the source code of the web pages;
*Allows an attacker to gain general information about target


This is a simpler approach and can normally be integrated with any risk
calculation methodology.

We can of course keep the references tho the more complicated methods.

Regards,

Sebastien

Perhaps using CVSS for rating vulnerabilities, that way there is at
least a clearly quantifiable mechanism for rating the individual
vulnerability.

Once you have a CVSS metric you can assess the risk of the
vulnerability in the context of the entire system you are analyzing.

In the past I have experimented with using weighted graphs of the
communications path through the deployment environment to calculate
the risk, with the weight of each node on the graph being dependent on
the security controls in place.

Thoughts?

Agreed, this is the common approached used by most of the clients we  
work with, especially the banking sector.

Matteo i know you don't want to change it and get a draft out, but we  
need to be aware that many will follow our guide as the gospel on app  
testing and i'd rather we delay some bits so that newcomers to our  
industry have a good solid footing and not the one i had when this  
industry was started (a.k.a make up what you want, there isn't anyone  
to disagree)

What do you think? should we quickly agree on something less complex  
and get it written up (i can do this as im currently on holiday and  
have less commitments than usual)

Gents,
If we can get something "simple" but effective quickly I would go for that.
but can we make sure, as Dan says, that the quality does not suffer as it
[the guide] shall be a milestone/benchmark in app testing documentation
available today.
I would prefer if we stayed away from academic risk analysis and statistics.

Some of the intro documentation can still be used also.

Dan & Eoin

The critique expressed herein on quantitative risk models reflects my opinion too. It 
was introduced herein as an example (not the  method just an example) and leaving room 
for a qualitative risk analysis to be compared with and eventually chosen as a 
reference. 

My day to day experience with qualitative risk analysis consists on assigning to each 
vulnerability a risk factor based upon impact and easy of exploitation. The limitation 
I see on this is that relies mostly on the experience and knowledge of the pen tester 
while assigning risk factors. Experienced pen testers can do a risk evaluation in a 
bit based upon similar scenarios, type of vulnerability and knowledge of similar 
applications. 

So probably the question is how this risk evaluation guideline can can help less 
experienced pen testers. I think a risk questionnaire could probably help evaluate 
risks for common vulnerabilities in typical attack scenarios.

anyone who knows me well, knows i'm blonde and therefore need it done  
as simply as possible :0)

Where I work (Corsaire), we use a well proven way of defining risk.  
This isn't something we plucked out of the blue, but something that  
came with over 8 years experience in doing this voodoo and based on  
client feedback, it works!

Risk = imp x eoe x exp x nominal value.

We have gone over the above little equation in previous mails, so i  
wont bother doing it again. But the main difference here is applying  
it and defining a rating. I have always liked the following method:

1: Impact
Critical (attacker owns the box, end of story)
High (attacker gains access through some vulnerability and can then  
do further damage)
Medium (attacker can't really gain direct access, but can cause other  
damage)
Low (info leakage etc)

2: Ease of exploitation
Easy (any muppet with a browser can do it)
Moderate (attacker needs to have some skills and knowledge)
Difficult (no skript kiddy or hacking exposed reader could do it)

3: Exposure
Very high (any issue which is externally facing and available to the  
world and does not need any authentication)
High (the issue is exposed over the web or via 3rd parties but only  
to authenticated/registered users)
Medium (the host is widely available to known users. Think corporate  
lan applications)
Low (host is on a secured lan with very limited access)

4: Nominal Value
High (Any business critical system!)
Medium (important applications)
Low (workstations)

Any manager reading the above, and applying it to a vulnerability  
such as weak session ID generation, would understand it. The biggest  
problem we are currently facing in our industry is one of standards.  
There are so many ways to define this and that, we need to be strong  
and say "THIS IS THE OWASP WAY"

This is nicer, easier to apply, sharper and in my view better suited.

I concur 

 

It should also be clear that we are testing for vulnerabilities and also
report them as such, but that will go into the following section?

Sebastien

 

PS: didn't we start with this :-)?

it and defining a rating. I have always liked the following method:

1: Impact
Critical (attacker owns the box, end of story)
High (attacker gains access through some vulnerability and can then
do further damage) 
Medium (attacker can't really gain direct access, but can cause other
damage)
Low (info leakage etc)

2: Ease of exploitation
Easy (any muppet with a browser can do it)
Moderate (attacker needs to have some skills and knowledge) 
Difficult (no skript kiddy or hacking exposed reader could do it)

3: Exposure
Very high (any issue which is externally facing and available to the
world and does not need any authentication)
High (the issue is exposed over the web or via 3rd parties but only 
to authenticated/registered users)
Medium (the host is widely available to known users. Think corporate
lan applications)
Low (host is on a secured lan with very limited access)

4: Nominal Value
High (Any business critical system!) 
Medium (important applications)
Low (workstations)

Any manager reading the above, and applying it to a vulnerability
such as weak session ID generation, would understand it. The biggest
problem we are currently facing in our industry is one of standards. 
There are so many ways to define this and that, we need to be strong
and say "THIS IS THE OWASP WAY"

Hi,

 

I'm all for a very simple system, but a one-size-fits-all model is
unrealistic. One simple example is that corporate LAN applications are
frequently the most critical applications, but the model below minimizes
their importance.  I believe we should develop an OWASP framework with a
way for organizations to tailor it - so that it produces the right risk
ratings for them.

 

I suggest we start with the standard risk model....

 

       Risk = Likelihood * Impact

 

There are a number of factors that go into likelihood and other factors
that go into impact.  Organizations can customize a standard risk
ranking framework by weighting these factors according to their
business.

 

Likelihood factors generally break down into information about the
threat agent, and information about the vulnerability:

 

-        Threat agent

o       Skill level required

o       Threat agent motivation (attractiveness of target)

o       Threat agent access level

o       Threat agent size

o       ...

 

-        Vulnerability

o       Ease of discovery

o       Awareness

o       Tools available

o       Mitigating controls in place

o       Accountability (not logged, logged w/o review, logged and
reviewed)

o       ...

 

Impact is generally calculated based on annualized loss expectancy
(ALE). Businesses should create a standard for what dollar amounts are
significant to their business and establish some levels for Impact.
Understanding the assets and functions involved, and the importance of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability to the business is critical
to getting good estimates of the real business impact. Reputation damage
is frequently the driver here.

 

Since none of these factors are very easy to measure, it's best to have
enumerated lists (like accountability above) for each factor that make
sense for the particular business.

 

The real tailoring comes from weighting these factors according to your
business.  Having a risk ranking framework that's customizable for a
business is critical for adoption.  Otherwise, you'll spend lots of time
arguing about the risk ratings that are produced.

 

Based on the factors and weights, you calculate whether the likelihood
is L, M, or H and whether the impact is L, M, or H.  Then you can
calculate the overall risk with a 9-box.

 

                                                            OVERALL
SEVERITY

 

HIGH LIKELIHOOD

Medium

High

Critical

MEDIUM LIKELIHOOD

Low

Medium

High

LOW LIKELIHOOD

Note

Low

Medium

 

LOW IMPACT

MEDIUM IMPACT

HIGH IMPACT

 

 

If the list is okay with this approach, I will write it up in time for
the release.  I can imagine a simple tool that queries you for
information like what are your different user groups, etc.. then the
tool allows you to weight the factors, then it produces a custom risk
rating tool for your organization's application security findings.
Built into report generator this would be very cool.

 

--Jeff

This is nicer, easier to apply, sharper and in my view better suited.

Where I work (Corsaire), we use a well proven way of defining risk.
This isn't something we plucked out of the blue, but something that
came with over 8 years experience in doing this voodoo and based on
client feedback, it works!

Risk = imp x eoe x exp x nominal value.

Hi Jeff,
If you wish to take a stab at writing a realistic reisk analysis piece that
would be great.
Even better if you could work along side Dan et al.
Re the ORG (report generator) I was talking to Dinis in Seattle about this
and we intend to integrate the Testing guide and the ORG from a technical
perspective.
Each area in the guide shall be integrated into the template for the ORG.
The XML to do this shall be available on the Wiki. This means that over time
the ORG template shall concurr with the  current testing guide and keep the
tool up to date.

thanks,
Eoin

Hi,
I notice that we have done a step backward on our discussion about defining
risk.
Rewriting the risk section is a good idea, but we have very little time.
I want to deliver the Testing Guide in pdf format by next saturday 23th Dec,
so is it possible for you to update this paragraph by tomorrow (22th Dec)?

Thanks,
Mat

I've added more information there and the table is overflowing now the 
page. I think that we should change the presentation so that you would have:

A table with one product per file with the cookies names it uses. The 
cookies names are linked to the next section. (ordered alphabetically)

A (text) list (or <dt>?) o paragraph with each cookie name, a generic 
description of the cookie (or specific, if only one product uses) and 
all the information on implementation details (content of the cookie, 
format, usage) for the different products using that cookie (this is 
where the table would link to). (ordered alphabetically)

If you see the current "database" there are multiple cookie names which 
are reused amongs products (JSESSIONID, Ltpatoken) with different 
content or values and having them listed by cookiename leads to confusion.

Check out the 'ltpatoken' information I recently added (to the bottom of 
the table) to see why the table format is not appropiate for cookie 
format/usage/references.

Thank you...this is the final great work!
I'm reading it and updating the final doc.
I'll deliver the Testing Guide in doc format to you by the next 4 hours.

Happy holidays to all,

Mat,

 

I've completed the forward and the risk article.  Andrew has reviewed
the risk article, but I'm sure there will be comments and updates (which
I'm looking forward to).  Sorry for the last minute work.

 

Happy holidays everyone,

If you wish to take a stab at writing a realistic reisk analysis piece
that would be great.

Even better if you could work along side Dan et al.

this and we intend to integrate the Testing guide and the ORG from a
technical perspective.

Each area in the guide shall be integrated into the template for the
ORG. The XML to do this shall be available on the Wiki. This means that
over time the ORG template shall concurr with the  current testing guide
and keep the tool up to date. 

 

thanks,

Eoin

Hi,

 

I'm all for a very simple system, but a one-size-fits-all model is
unrealistic. One simple example is that corporate LAN applications are
frequently the most critical applications, but the model below minimizes
their importance.  I believe we should develop an OWASP framework with a
way for organizations to tailor it - so that it produces the right risk
ratings for them. 

 

I suggest we start with the standard risk model....

 

       Risk = Likelihood * Impact

 

There are a number of factors that go into likelihood and other factors
that go into impact.  Organizations can customize a standard risk
ranking framework by weighting these factors according to their
business. 

 

Likelihood factors generally break down into information about the
threat agent, and information about the vulnerability:

 

-        Threat agent

o       Skill level required

o       Threat agent motivation (attractiveness of target)

o       Threat agent access level

o       Threat agent size

o       ...

 

-        Vulnerability

o       Ease of discovery

o       Awareness

o       Tools available

o       Mitigating controls in place

o       Accountability (not logged, logged w/o review, logged and
reviewed)

o       ...

 

Impact is generally calculated based on annualized loss expectancy
(ALE). Businesses should create a standard for what dollar amounts are
significant to their business and establish some levels for Impact.
Understanding the assets and functions involved, and the importance of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability to the business is critical
to getting good estimates of the real business impact. Reputation damage
is frequently the driver here. 

 

Since none of these factors are very easy to measure, it's best to have
enumerated lists (like accountability above) for each factor that make
sense for the particular business. 

 

The real tailoring comes from weighting these factors according to your
business.  Having a risk ranking framework that's customizable for a
business is critical for adoption.  Otherwise, you'll spend lots of time
arguing about the risk ratings that are produced. 

 

Based on the factors and weights, you calculate whether the likelihood
is L, M, or H and whether the impact is L, M, or H.  Then you can
calculate the overall risk with a 9-box. 

 

                                                            OVERALL
SEVERITY

 

HIGH LIKELIHOOD

Medium

High

Critical

MEDIUM LIKELIHOOD

Low

Medium

High

LOW LIKELIHOOD

Note

Low

Medium

 

LOW IMPACT

MEDIUM IMPACT

HIGH IMPACT

 

 

If the list is okay with this approach, I will write it up in time for
the release.  I can imagine a simple tool that queries you for
information like what are your different user groups, etc.. then the
tool allows you to weight the factors, then it produces a custom risk
rating tool for your organization's application security findings.
Built into report generator this would be very cool.

This is nicer, easier to apply, sharper and in my view better suited.

Where I work (Corsaire), we use a well proven way of defining risk. 
This isn't something we plucked out of the blue, but something that
came with over 8 years experience in doing this voodoo and based on
client feedback, it works!

Risk = imp x eoe x exp x nominal value. 

We have gone over the above little equation in previous mails, so i
wont bother doing it again. But the main difference here is applying
it and defining a rating. I have always liked the following method:

1: Impact
Critical (attacker owns the box, end of story)
High (attacker gains access through some vulnerability and can then
do further damage) 
Medium (attacker can't really gain direct access, but can cause other 
damage)
Low (info leakage etc)

2: Ease of exploitation
Easy (any muppet with a browser can do it)
Moderate (attacker needs to have some skills and knowledge) 
Difficult (no skript kiddy or hacking exposed reader could do it) 

3: Exposure
Very high (any issue which is externally facing and available to the
world and does not need any authentication)
High (the issue is exposed over the web or via 3rd parties but only 
to authenticated/registered users) 
Medium (the host is widely available to known users. Think corporate
lan applications)
Low (host is on a secured lan with very limited access)

4: Nominal Value
High (Any business critical system!) 
Medium (important applications)
Low (workstations)

Any manager reading the above, and applying it to a vulnerability
such as weak session ID generation, would understand it. The biggest
problem we are currently facing in our industry is one of standards. 
There are so many ways to define this and that, we need to be strong
and say "THIS IS THE OWASP WAY"
