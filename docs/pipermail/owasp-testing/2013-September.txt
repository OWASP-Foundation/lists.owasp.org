Subject: [Owasp-testing] Broken Link
Message-ID: <CAHw3cgTr0vfX--djHMyZpf7kcnoMbeWM3-1GpFXgFGXh_-RUxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've noticed that a link in the "Tools" section of this page 404s -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_XML_Injection_(OWASP-DV-008)

I'm not sure what the procedure is in updating/removing this?!

If I find any broken links in the wiki shall I look for alternatives and
add them, if none can be found just remove them? or is there a procedure in
place for updating these?

404 URL - http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/pentest/wordlists/injections/XML.txt

Thanks,
Ryan

Well we made it to the end of the August sprint. Great effort and thanks to
everyone that has contributed! We'll use this week to review what has been
done and what remains. If you've been working offline, now is the time to
upload your content to the wiki.

We'll start a two week sprint from the middle of September. So get your
rest while you can!

If you have any questions, please don't hestitate to drop me or Matt a line.

regards,
  Andrew.

Hi,

I've put together a page on Testing WebSockets within the Client Side
testing section.

This is an initial draft, I would be grateful for suggestions on how to
improve it as this is the first time I've written (this much) for the
testing guide.

Thanks in advance,

Christian,

This isn't a court so stop. Your evidence is not something I can
confirm nor cross-examine. And you don't attack the Medical School if
a doctor is reportedly performing malpractice. Whatever your grievance
with Pure Hacking it's not the fault of us or the OSSTMM but how they
did their business in a particular instance. PH hasn't been an ISECOM
partner for many years so again, not sure why you're coming at us.
What I can do is take your complaint and address PH with it. That's
what we do when a group claims to use the OSSTMM a particular way and
another party thinks it's not true. And I'll do that. Thanks for your
note and next time don't wait almost 4 years to let us know of an
alleged incident so we can address it in a timely manner.

As for your robots.txt stuff:

OSSTMM 3

11.4.2
(c) Examine target web-based application source code and scripts to
determine the existence of additional targets in the network.

11.6.3
(a) Test the depth of access to business or confidential information
available on web servers without any established, required credentials.


OSSTMM 2

In the sec-testing template, there is the following:

Web Page Date Last Modified
Web Links Internal
Web Site Searchability
Web Links External


So while we don't call it what you call it, we do expect it to be
reviewed along with other important information.

Sincerely,
-pete.

Andrew,

Just a quick update on the status of OTG-INFO-003.

I have completed the robots.txt and <META> Tag section of OTG-INFO-003
for both Google and Bing (excluding some formatting and possible
spelling errors).

I still don't have an example for "Analyze robots.txt using Google
Webmaster Tools" so I can't complete this.  I will leave it to you
judgement if you want to include this subsection or not?

I want to include a new section related to http://www.sitemaps.org/
but will need more time (perhaps for the roadmap of v5?).

Also, can we renumber this as OTG-INFO-002 i.e. (I have left the
titles unchanged but these should be modified too as per your
judgement)
1. Fingerprint Web Server
2. Review Webserver Metafiles for Information Leakage
3. Conduct Search Engine Discovery and Reconnaissance for Information Leakage

Please let me know if you need further information?  If you believe it
would be easier to resolve over the telephone don't hesitate to give
me a call.

In reference to the breach being "almost 4 years" ago:
- The most recent breach is dated May 2013 i.e.
http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/oops-google-search-reveals-private-telstra-customer-data-20130516-2jnmw.html.
- Pure Hacking where teaching ISECOM courseware over five years (in
2006) before the initial breach in December 2011 i.e.
http://www.zdnet.com/accredited-open-source-anti-hacking-course-launches-1139263109/

I can confirm that Pure Hacking requested the modification of the news
article published by Fairfax.  You can also observe a similar
behaviour when Ty Miller refused to be quoted again within
http://www.zdnet.com/thomsons-phone-clone-claims-uncertain-1339338352/
when his initial quote by SMH was challenged.

This is not hearsay based on these quotes (as of Friday 6 September
2013 after 5:15PM (AEST):
1. http://www.purehacking.com/about-us/our-team - "Staff members are
regular contributors the Open Source Security Testing Methodology
Manual (OSSTMM), certified Trainers of Penetration Testing
Professionals of OSSTMM,"
2. http://www.purehacking.com/news/afd-technical-details - a number of
quotes about "OSSTMM's
  requirement for detecting active filtering such as IDP or IPS".
3.https://www.purehacking.com/news/active-filter-detection - "As an
OSSTMM auditor Pure Hacking"

Your analogy hasn't considered that Ty (and Pure Hacking) are listed
by ISECOM as a contributor to the OSSTMM and are therefore held to a
higher standard in their implementation of the OSSTMM.

Ty Miller left Pure Hacking in May 2013 according to
http://au.linkedin.com/pub/ty-miller/16/a45/963 so I am not sure how
you concluded that PH are not at least a "recent" partner of ISECOM.
I believe Ty Miller is aware of this thread based on his recent
recorded visit to http://www.linkedin.com/in/ChristianHeinrich

The easiest course of action would be for ISECOM to issue a press
release clarifying Pure Hacking partnership with ISECOM and OSSTMM
rather than approaching Telstra and/or Pure Hacking to release the
related artifacts

If what ISECOM allege about Pure Hacking's partnership is true than
this won't be their first time that Pure Hacking have been found
guilty of brand abuse i.e.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2006-November/005317.html

OSSTMM v2 was released almost a decade before December 2011 i.e.
http://www.zdnet.com/accredited-open-source-anti-hacking-course-launches-1139263109/

I'll add 11.4.2 and 11.6.3 from OSSTMM v3 as references (where
relevant) to OTG-INFO-001 or OTG-INFO-003 of the OWASP Testing Guide.

Subject: [Owasp-testing] version 4 release date?
Message-ID: <CAAKTuhzNC+kjQGXgCdSuURrAdnT62qTLDucBBr=UZbLAiN1s6Q@mail.gmail.com>

What is the expected date for release of WTG4?

We're trying to standardize our assessment methodologies around a common
numbering scheme to improve our coverage and make our testing more uniform
and repeatable.

The OCR and WTG are very helpful guides in that effort.
