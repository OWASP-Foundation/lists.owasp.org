Hi,

- Tomotsugu Aoki
- Masashi Fujiwara
- HIROGUCHI, Masayuki
- ISHIZUKI, Yoko
- IWAMI, Shino
- Tetsuo Kuge

we have now the Testing Guide translated in Japanese!

You can download it here:

I see that there is not already a Japan Chapter, is that possible? Why
do you not start the Chapter now?

Great job, thanks!

Also please consider enriching the OWASP Internationalization guidelines
by adding English to Japanese guidelines, now that you have the
experience to define them :)

It will help you to more easily integrate translators to your efforts.

Congratulations!!

Hello Matteo,
your announcement sounds both good news and bad news for me
in the interpretation team.

I am glad to read your cheerful announcement, thank you.
However, that version is under final review, sorry to notify you after your announcement.

We just received the merged v3 in Japanese at the beginning of this month.
Due to the schedule delay, Masayuki (Hiroguchi, Masayuki) stated to notify
(ISC)2 Japan about our current status to check whole guide as the one guide.
He stated us about the due date of final verification to be August 20th.
So I am reading the Japanese version in these days, from 1st page.

We would like to provide updated version sooner after August 20th,
evaluating collected verification result from each member.

By th way, I would like to confirm the phrase "MANUAL INSPECTIONS" in
page 20 of OWASP_Testing_Guide_V3.pdf.
_______________________________________________________
I guess the section means that the quality team will read all documents in detail:
the system, operation, procedure of each task, written guide of business, etc.,
then review what is right in the target organization, right?

Reading all documents, collecting information from interview of key drivers,
evaluating all information by cross check, and figure out whole man-machine
system  including both written fact and not-written fact, should be the key activity
of that section, I believe.
Perhaps I have to suggest a mis-interpretation of that section.

Hi Kuge,
sorry for the misunderstanding. I've updated the page.

Yes, you are right about "Manual inspection" paragraph.

Thanks,
Mat
