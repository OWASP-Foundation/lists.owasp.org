Sunni/Jim,
  v4 IS complete and is currently with the book designer. Matteo and I are very keen for it to be released/published in time for AppsecUSA.

Hello OWASP Testing Guide Team,

The v4 TOC for the Testing Guide is one of the top 15 most popular pages at OWASP in and of itself.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

Many thousands of folks (15,000 or so per month) hit this page directly when looking for testing guide information.

Is there anything we can do to make this page more attractive? Perhaps give it a theme or add a paragraph at the top?

Thanks for considering,
Jim Manico
OWASP Wiki Editor/Cleanup Team
