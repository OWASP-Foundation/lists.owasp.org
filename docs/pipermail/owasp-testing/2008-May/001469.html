<PRE>Hello Matteo and all,

When you say new concept, I'm assuming a new concept for the guide. As to
where it fits as part of the index, I can't clearly see it at this time.  To
be clearer on the term Software System upgrades and migrations, please see
my definition below.

Software System Upgrade:
Basically, is testing the end result of the the data and application when a
patch/upgrade/hotfix has been applied to it (Upgrade path Testing)

Typically, testing this process is as follows
1. installation verification
Did the installation of the patches/upgrade executable/script to the
existing system cause an failures. In the context of a web application is
there exceptions/failures in the application log

2. Database verification (if required, but typically required in majority of
web applications)
This is a two step process where a tester would look to see (either the
output of the upgrade script or database logs) if any error occurred in the
logs
Second, a capture of a subset of a data from before and after would be done
to analyze transformations of data

3. Does the application behave the same way it did before (Functional
testing)

As for migrations, this is defined by completely moving over the another
system.
Examples of migrations:
application A uses MySQL Database -&gt; Apply migration -&gt; application A now
uses PostGres database
application B uses PHP -&gt; Apply migration -&gt; application B now uses Java

The reason I mention the above examples is because I have been exposed to
this scenario where it was expected that the application continues to behave
to same after the transformation


Thats the background of upgrade and migration testings

I guess the next question is how does the above apply to security testing

I've seen changes to table schemas where by the code is not reflective of
the change in the database and as a result &quot;private&quot; or sensitive data has
been exposed.

Not sure where this falls under the current index.  This topic is not
commonly thought of in both the development and testing teams.

Looking for feedback from anyone

Cheers

Basim
