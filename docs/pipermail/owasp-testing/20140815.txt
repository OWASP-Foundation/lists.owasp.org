Ah now this is the one I was talking about, Jim :)

Please refrain from updates to the test guide until we release v4 (very, very soon)

Thanks Jim :)

Sounds like a good idea to redirect from the V2 wiki pages to V4 and label the V2 pages as historical.

You got it, Andrew.

A few more testing guide pages show up as "the most popular pages on the 
OWASP wiki".

*** This V2 Page is very popular -> 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Cross_site_scripting Can we 
redirect this to V4 or label it as "historical"?

The following V4 testing guide pages are also "very popular" but we will 
not touch them for now :)

Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Testing Guide v4 TOC

Hello OWASP Testing Guide Team,

The v4 TOC for the Testing Guide is one of the top 15 most popular pages at OWASP in and of itself.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

Many thousands of folks (15,000 or so per month) hit this page directly when looking for testing guide information.

Is there anything we can do to make this page more attractive? Perhaps give it a theme or add a paragraph at the top?

Thanks for considering,
Jim Manico
OWASP Wiki Editor/Cleanup Team
