Hello,

I am searching for a good/proven FOSS C/C++ decompiler. Any experience
on using these good/proven decompiler? I need recommendation here.

Thanks!

You're out of luck here Zaki.
The best C/C++ "decompiler" is HexRay but it's not FOSS. HexRay is a plugin for IDA.

The FOSS alternative is Boomerang but it's too far behind to be usable.

Cheers
Nam

Subject: [Owasp-testing] ASVS users... Are you one?
Message-ID: <21D3693DA55EF14BB72DCC18FB65B291024089BA3E@ASHBMBX04.resource.ds.bah.com>

... tell us your stories!

It's been a while since I went looking for ASVS users (organizations) to add to the project page. I know there are quite a few more out there than are currently listed from chatting with you individually. I've been a little lazy, not following up with people to ask if I may list them on the project page to their organization's support for the project as I've been chatting with them.

ASVS Japanese, French, German, Chinese, Hungarian, Malay translators - what organizations are interested in these versions of ASVS? There's at least one of you out there for each of these languages for which translations from English are currently underway :-) Developers, testers -- Inquiring minds want to know!

Note that the definition of "user" is pretty broad, you don't have to have scrapped whatever you're currently doing or stapled printouts of ASVS onto your cubicle walls in order to be considered a "user". Scroll down to the "Did you know..." section here to see what I mean: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project#tab=Home

Show your organization's support for the project by lending your name to the list of users!

Best,

Mike B.

PS - Please feel free to forward this email as appropriate.

PPS - Development Guide people, turns out you're now an ASVS user! Or at least you're working on it! Show your organization's support for the new Guide direction, become an ASVS user! Same goes for the other guides, at least at some point in the future as the guides are updated with the new ASVS common numbering scheme! Show your support for unifying the guides by listing yourself as an ASVS user!

it would help if you could be more specific about the application and what you're trying to accomplish or how the information currently in the guide is not meeting your goal/expectation.

Message-ID: <13e5eed1003160417v175a8213xd9b1058028304906@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Currently I'm performing a test on a web application.
I identified that a certain number (which consists out of 8 digits)
corresponds to the value of a cookie.
However, this number is encoded since the value of the cookie consists out
of 32 digits.

 f( [[:digit:]]{8} ) = [[:digit:]]{32}

It's not MD5. And I think that the server must be able to decode the value,
so it shouldn't be a one-way function.

Does anybody know of an algorithm or function which would generate this?

Thanks for any ideas.
Regards,

Lode

Might cheat sheet authors consider contributing cycles to the Development Guide, all of whom I think are on these lists?

I think, that is the right place for cheat sheet info to be. They otherwise are kind of random unrated content. Awesome content, but unrated and disorganized. The structure of the Guide would also provide a "roadmap" for developing additional cheat sheet content (really, Guide content) for those who are interested in contributing such awesome content.

Thanks Ryan, Kevin, Mike

I thought we might of had an "OWASP definition" of Reverse BF seen as we
should be testing for it, providing detective & preventative measures etc.

Standardised definitions are useful in terms of people learning what an
issue is regardless of if it relates to code dev, test, review or
deployment. It would be good to develop an OWASP dictionary/ thesaurus, such
like the oxford dictionary for English.

Would this assist in people mixing up CSRF and XSS :0) and stuff like that?

Robust defs for issues may also help define a consistent methodology in
testing for such issues or coding against them?

who knows?

Current and aspiring cheat sheet authors:

The development guide project wants YOU!

It recently occurred to me that the rise of cheat sheets reflect a need to have an updated development guide, for which work has recently begun.

I think, the development guide is the right place for cheat sheet info to be. They otherwise are kind of random unrated content. Absolutely awesome new content, but unrated (with respect to OWASP project criteria) and disorganized. Putting these in the Guide will centralize them, and make them easy to find, as well as easy to find related content. The structure of the Guide would also provide a "roadmap" for developing additional cheat sheet content (really, Guide content) for those who are interested in contributing such awesome content.

Please see below for more details. Please consider contributing new cheat sheets directly to the guide project. Here is the current annotated outline, in wiki format: http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/Guide

Best,

Mike B.

Subject: [Owasp-guide] Outline revised to include "cheat sheet" sections
Importance: High

Hi,

FYI, I've revised the input validation guidelines outline to reflect a revised outline structure which should then be reflected across the other guidelines sections:

# OWASP-0500 Input Validation

    * OWASP-0502 Verify that a positive validation pattern is defined and applied to all input.
          o OWASP-0502-DG-01 Define a positive validation pattern for all input
                + Worksheet <-- please note the shorter title
          o OWASP-0502-DG-02 Apply a positive validation pattern to all input
                + Build or buy? <-- please note the shorter title
                + Cheat sheet <--the two existing sections were collapsed into one new one
                + See also

So, we have "worksheets" and "cheat sheets", but no more "checklists" which hadn't yet been defined in more detail. Accordingly, in SVN, I renamed the checklist directory "cheat_sheets" and renamed the one placeholder/sample "owasp-guide-0500-input-validation-cheat-sheet.doc".

For those lucky few who are working on sections for which corresponding cheat sheets exist, you've just written a section, cut-paste that text over!! Please make sure to keep the attribution in tact (i.e. right now just cut-paste the whole thing for each cheat sheet), we'll consolidate attribution information later on.

Note that these sections didn't really go away, if you read the cheat sheets, you'll see that they provide advice where and how to use controls, just in an all-in-one kinda format. The build/buy sections also persist, it's imporant to have tables in these sections that summarize/clearly state what's expected in terms of security checks/effects.

Best,

Mike B.
