English is not only my first language but I do review security documentation for grammar and ?sense? as part of my day job as well, so I don?t mind giving it a detailed overview and highlighting what should be changed, if anything?

If so let me know, and whether you would like me to make notes on a separate document or do you have it in Word so I can track changes?

Regards,

Dimitri
