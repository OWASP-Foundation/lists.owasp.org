<PRE>Hi Mark,

The guide is shaping out great....
Sorry for the lack of participation...was a bit busy....But I will make up
for it ;)

Attached is a small section on xss. Let me know what you think.

Thanks
Kartik

&gt;<i> Crew,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its late I am tired and so I haven't made this polite or politically
</I>&gt;<i> correct. Pls forgive me before reading. Nothing is personal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will re-write into and what are web applications sections. I have to
</I>&gt;<i> do this for the Guide anyways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Page 15 - Pretty diagram but not sure what it is trying to show ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Page 16 / 66 - I think planning of each phase of a test occurs, its not
</I>&gt;<i> a discrete task. You plan the architecture assessment as well as an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation review.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly (STRONGLY) think that there are discrete Requirements,
</I>&gt;<i> Architecture (design), Implementation and Management Reviews. There may
</I>&gt;<i> even be more phases we wish to call out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Section 5 should be removed for the same reasons as section 1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Planning a test - maybe this section should be replaced with an overview
</I>&gt;<i> about testing, planning, organizing etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> white box, black box, static whitebox....urgh i hate those terms. If we
</I>&gt;<i> are going to use them then we need to really clearly define them in a
</I>&gt;<i> glossary so we are all on the same page as to exactly what they mean. I
</I>&gt;<i> hate them ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on above comments the requirements review and architecture
</I>&gt;<i> analysis doesn't exist
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Page 17 / 66 - agree with Nicks comments earlier. I think this is like
</I>&gt;<i> 25% at most of a good assessment methodology. Its the after the fact
</I>&gt;<i> tactical testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 23 / 66 - obtaining source code - this should be the norm not the ab
</I>&gt;<i> norm. It says in large tests. I don't think thats true. It also says in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to pen tests. It should read as part of the testing life cycle
</I>&gt;<i> including requirements, management etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 24 / 66 - this is a UML sequence diagram and we should use well
</I>&gt;<i> understood language and syntax I think
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 25 / 66 - Infr review - I was thinking this would include more stuff
</I>&gt;<i> like if the app uses getHostByName() and not GetHostbyIP() or doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> synchronize tie clocks making timing attacks possible
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 26 / 66 - everyone should have dev, qa, pre-prod and prod. I would
</I>&gt;<i> strongly argue that most testing is well before prod. Real data should
</I>&gt;<i> never (NEVER) be used in testing. This section IMHO needs a big rewrite.
</I>&gt;<i> This is all good and well for momandpops.php but....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 27 - 66 - decompilers ? This is testing not hacking ;-) I think this
</I>&gt;<i> section should explain how browser proxies work, how automated scanners
</I>&gt;<i> are combos of automated http_user agents and fuzzers etc. It needs to
</I>&gt;<i> outline source code analyzers. There are technical tools and checklist
</I>&gt;<i> tools for the management reviews as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DCMA - should be moved into an overview section if not removed. DCMA is
</I>&gt;<i> about reverse engineering stuff, not examining stuff with permission
</I>&gt;<i> unless I am missing the point
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 33 / 66 - webdav is an http extension and not an httpd extension.
</I>&gt;<i> Options will return that baby ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SSL - again this is stuff an arch review and implementation / code
</I>&gt;<i> review combined are best suited for. I am not sure I get the comments
</I>&gt;<i> about making sure an entire page is SSL. You should make sure your
</I>&gt;<i> applications transport matches your requirements but in many cases only
</I>&gt;<i> sending data back may require a tunnel. This section should explain the
</I>&gt;<i> SSL helo, how the cipher suites are determined and how you find
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms supported and key lengths etc. Saying you should block old
</I>&gt;<i> SSL (which I assume you mean 2) is interesting. Why ? Let the SSL
</I>&gt;<i> negotiate the best it can do and allow your customers to make the choice
</I>&gt;<i> with informed info.Summary, this section should show how to determine
</I>&gt;<i> SSL version, cipher specs, and cert validity.And its all in the ssl
</I>&gt;<i> headers and I can knock up a quick Java app if you want as a demo. JSSE
</I>&gt;<i> is a king.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SSL requirements by source code on each page ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And on that section its back to the code review / arch review / pen test
</I>&gt;<i> thing. Looking at this from the outside is much harder than inspecting
</I>&gt;<i> the code and arch. Have a good MVC model and you know one thing. Look at
</I>&gt;<i> JSSE and you know another
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 33 /66 . old backup unreferenced files. This doesn't explain how to
</I>&gt;<i> test. Too much guide type explanation. I think we should provide a list
</I>&gt;<i> of extensions mapped to apps asa to asp for instance from FP, and then
</I>&gt;<i> explain how from a crawled site and common file names you fuzz requests
</I>&gt;<i> and look for an http 200 to come back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Less mature code - bit of a leap of faith isn't it ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is only true if you build on same box as you deploy anyway which is
</I>&gt;<i> a big no no IMHO. We cant just say the tools used to spider should check
</I>&gt;<i> for this. Its a cop out ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 38 - logging 0- again as a general comment we should be driving people
</I>&gt;<i> to testing against logging requirements or best practice. The logging
</I>&gt;<i> section is a valid point but what about testing to make sure failed
</I>&gt;<i> logins actual log, about malicious input creates an event etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK only half way thru and probably offended 90% of people by now, but
</I>&gt;<i> candid comments is the only way to go. If anyone finds this helpful I
</I>&gt;<i> will do the rest, if not tell me or ignore.
</I>&gt;<i>
