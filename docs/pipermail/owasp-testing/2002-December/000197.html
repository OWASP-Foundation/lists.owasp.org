<PRE>Crew,

Its late I am tired and so I haven't made this polite or politically 
correct. Pls forgive me before reading. Nothing is personal.

I will re-write into and what are web applications sections. I have to
do this for the Guide anyways.

Page 15 - Pretty diagram but not sure what it is trying to show ?

Page 16 / 66 - I think planning of each phase of a test occurs, its not
a discrete task. You plan the architecture assessment as well as an
implementation review.

I strongly (STRONGLY) think that there are discrete Requirements,
Architecture (design), Implementation and Management Reviews. There may
even be more phases we wish to call out. 

Section 5 should be removed for the same reasons as section 1

Planning a test - maybe this section should be replaced with an overview
about testing, planning, organizing etc

white box, black box, static whitebox....urgh i hate those terms. If we
are going to use them then we need to really clearly define them in a
glossary so we are all on the same page as to exactly what they mean. I
hate them ;-)

Based on above comments the requirements review and architecture
analysis doesn't exist

Page 17 / 66 - agree with Nicks comments earlier. I think this is like
25% at most of a good assessment methodology. Its the after the fact
tactical testing. 

23 / 66 - obtaining source code - this should be the norm not the ab
norm. It says in large tests. I don't think thats true. It also says in
addition to pen tests. It should read as part of the testing life cycle
including requirements, management etc

24 / 66 - this is a UML sequence diagram and we should use well
understood language and syntax I think

25 / 66 - Infr review - I was thinking this would include more stuff
like if the app uses getHostByName() and not GetHostbyIP() or doesn't
synchronize tie clocks making timing attacks possible

26 / 66 - everyone should have dev, qa, pre-prod and prod. I would
strongly argue that most testing is well before prod. Real data should
never (NEVER) be used in testing. This section IMHO needs a big rewrite.
This is all good and well for momandpops.php but....

27 - 66 - decompilers ? This is testing not hacking ;-) I think this
section should explain how browser proxies work, how automated scanners
are combos of automated http_user agents and fuzzers etc. It needs to
outline source code analyzers. There are technical tools and checklist
tools for the management reviews as well. 

DCMA - should be moved into an overview section if not removed. DCMA is
about reverse engineering stuff, not examining stuff with permission
unless I am missing the point

33 / 66 - webdav is an http extension and not an httpd extension.
Options will return that baby ;-)

SSL - again this is stuff an arch review and implementation / code
review combined are best suited for. I am not sure I get the comments
about making sure an entire page is SSL. You should make sure your
applications transport matches your requirements but in many cases only
sending data back may require a tunnel. This section should explain the
SSL helo, how the cipher suites are determined and how you find
algorithms supported and key lengths etc. Saying you should block old
SSL (which I assume you mean 2) is interesting. Why ? Let the SSL
negotiate the best it can do and allow your customers to make the choice
with informed info.Summary, this section should show how to determine
SSL version, cipher specs, and cert validity.And its all in the ssl
headers and I can knock up a quick Java app if you want as a demo. JSSE
is a king.

SSL requirements by source code on each page ?

And on that section its back to the code review / arch review / pen test
thing. Looking at this from the outside is much harder than inspecting
the code and arch. Have a good MVC model and you know one thing. Look at
JSSE and you know another

33 /66 . old backup unreferenced files. This doesn't explain how to
test. Too much guide type explanation. I think we should provide a list
of extensions mapped to apps asa to asp for instance from FP, and then
explain how from a crawled site and common file names you fuzz requests
and look for an http 200 to come back.

Less mature code - bit of a leap of faith isn't it ?

This is only true if you build on same box as you deploy anyway which is
a big no no IMHO. We cant just say the tools used to spider should check
for this. Its a cop out ;-)

38 - logging 0- again as a general comment we should be driving people
to testing against logging requirements or best practice. The logging
section is a valid point but what about testing to make sure failed
logins actual log, about malicious input creates an event etc

OK only half way thru and probably offended 90% of people by now, but
candid comments is the only way to go. If anyone finds this helpful I
will do the rest, if not tell me or ignore.
