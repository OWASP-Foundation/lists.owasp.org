Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Pen Test Document from David Endler
Message-ID: <000501c34098$d9b41410$e33ca8c0@components>

Hi all,

I am new to this mailing list and wonder where to get the Penetration
Testing document from OWASP/David Endler & crew
(http://www.owasp.org/testing/) from. SourceForge only says "No Releases"
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424), but I read
some archived mailings where people downloaded from there...

Anybody out there who can mail me the latest release of the document or give
me a download link?

TIA,

Michael Susser

Hi Michael,

The guide is being proofed and updated at the moment.  A staged release
is planned through the new OWASP portal site, but due to other
commitments on the oPortal and Guide teams both have been delayed.

Watch this space for updates - we do aim to publish the material as soon
as we can!

Regards,
Glyn.

Hi all,

I'm sorry to have been offline at such a crucial point in our group.
Rumors of my death/imprisonment/Vegas one-man-show debut/desert island
stranding have been greatly exagerated.  

I am just beginning to catch up with my online activities and sincerely
hope my absense has not stalled or derailed the project permanently.
We're embarrassingly behind schedule as a group and I take full
responsibility.  I'm still fully engaged to lead us to produce a full
document and hope this lag hasn't destroyed what credibility I have left
;-)

I will be beginning to reform our project plan, landing pages, and the
content we started a while ago.  I'll also be talking to Mark to decide
how to best proceed in coordination with the OWASP portal.

Everyone

I have left messages for David who seems to have vanished. I am
personally quite concerned (he is very reliable) but I have no other way
of tracking him down and making sure things are OK. With the portal up
and moving to its production hosting over the next two weeks we can now
start releasing testing and getting on a regular testing chapters
release cycle. 

Is anyone else willing and able to step up tp the plate and lead this
project ? If so please mail me off-line.

Thanks

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Sourceforge Setup for Windows
Message-ID: <005001c34404$94072500$83bd06d1@markc2000>

Self confessed two reasons for asking this question ;-)

1. I only use Sourceforge under Linux and having once spent a frustrating 4 hours trying to set up Cygwin and so on on a Windows box, I gave up before my head became permanently caved in.

2. It would be really good if we had a "How to use Sourceforge for Windows Dummies" on the portal at some point.

So does anyone have a document with a step by step guide and screen shots of how to get Sourceforge working under Windows (ideally using VS.NET) ?

Mark,

I'm in a similar situation (I have Win98 on my home box), and have found
TortoiseCVS absolutely wonderful (I'm using v1.2.2, though they recently
released 1.4.0).  It has integrated SSH via PuTTY, so there's no need for
Cygwin, which I always had problems with as well.  Definitely check it out:
http://www.tortoisecvs.org/

Chris

I'll second that -- TortoiseCVS rocks.
