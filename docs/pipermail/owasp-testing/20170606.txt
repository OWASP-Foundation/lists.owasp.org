Hi,

sorry for the late.

Thanks to Dinis we have now a Github repository here:

https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Testing-Guide-v5

Please let's start to contribute with the new ideas!

Who will be present next week at the OWASP Summit?

Thanks,

Mat

I just submitted a pull request that added some headings to structure
workload identification and put a candidate new test out there--Server-Side
Template Injection (SSTI).

Are we starting from scratch or are we updating the guide.

If updating Why not fork https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Testing-Guide
(older version i suppose), and then we can focus on what has changed or
needs updation.

Once the articles required are finalised, it will be easier to find people
who could contribute to those sections.
