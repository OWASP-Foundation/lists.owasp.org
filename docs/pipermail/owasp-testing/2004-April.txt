But here's a summary

- Goal for pen-test may not be to get root or shell
access. App security is just as important as getting
root/admin.
- It's not always more cost-effective than other
forms. I think grey-box is ultimately the best balance
- Main disadvantages are that you only see the exposed
UI. It's not holistic security. You don't see the
backend. You may or may not find out about security
through obscurity. Do you get a false sense of
security when the pen-test company comes back and says
you are "above average" :)

Mark,

Here is the document with some comments, I wanted to dig deeper but ran out
of time, I hope you can use what is in there.
There's comments on the whole document.

Let me know when you have a more complete version!

It definitely looks good! Congrats.....

This seems to be shaping up nicely.  I think there should be a separate
mention of access control testing (aka authorization). Many web sites simply
rely on the user interface to enforce access control -- as long as the link
isn't there, you can't get to it right??  And most sites that have created
an access control mechanism have not implemented it to be tamperproof and
non-bypassable.  The test procedure is fairly simple.  Using a highly
privileged role, figure out how to access sensitive assets and functions.
Then using a less privileged role, attempt to access them.  If you succeed,
their mechanism is flawed.

OK team here is another updated Part 1 draft. I still haven't quite finished but its getting there.

I think at this stage I need to let someone else take the whole document and make it read well. I am too close to it. 

Is there anyone else out there that can take what we have and spend the week editing it, filling the gaps and create a first draft we can work from ?

Time is dragging on so hopefully we have a good editor who writes well with some time this week.

Let us know

Mark

Mark, on the authors section, would it be easier just to list the team as a whole?

Morning all,

I'm hoping we are really close to a 1.0 release on this doc, so could everyone give it a
good review and let me know 
what you think?
Ive also created a new flow diagram from Juan's original one, this has been heavily used
here at the Bank and it seems 
to work well (obviously feedback is happily accepted)

Mark, does this fit in with the Oasis standard?

Thanks. I agree this is coming along. I think though we need to do a bit
of work before release. 

Let me tackle that tonight and send out an updated draft. Here are my
thoughts.

1. We need to sync completely with the OASIS WAS list. 
2. We mix mechanisms with techniques. An example is we say "Forcing the
application to display error messages back to user (SQL errors, 404's)."
This is a technique. I personally think we need to extrapolate a little
i.e. sat that "test to ensure that the application can not be forced to
generate error conditions that would be useful to an attacker". I think
we need to intentionally be ambiguous otherwise it will be impossible to
list very potential issue. We could I guess go with the layout of "use
technique X to text mechanism Y" but I think that maybe tricky.
3. There are places where I think we need to look at what the security
implications are. As an example "Directory Enumeration	Search for all
directories under the web root. This includes hidden directories". I
think this should be covered by Access Control and we really need to be
saying something like "Ensure that there are no URL's or web resources
that can be accessed in violation of the Access Control policy /
design."
I think this is a common comment of mine. One suggestion of how we could
tackle this is to provide an example. So in the case of Access Control
we may have;
"Ensure that there are no URL's or web resources that can be accessed in
violation of the Access Control policy / design. An example of this
issue maybe URL's that an attacker could directly request and obtain
service without being challenged for appropriate credentials". (Not
happy with that but you can get the idea)

Anyways let me change it the way I think it should read and send it out
to see if people agree. I am thick skinned so if its not good that's
fine.

I'll do it now and send out before midnight EST('ish)

Cheers

Mark

OK, sorry for the delay in this. I thought I would get to it last night
but it took a little longer than I thought and some other things got in
the way. 

I have tried to make everything as an "issue" that should be checked for
and not a consequence or a technique. I have aligned this with OASIS WAS
Vuln Types although there are a few issues I would like to still add. I
have also removed the things that were techniques or consequences. 

Let me know what you think. I know we will need to add more issues etc
but I hope the formatting and style is now consistent. 

If you like it I suggest we use this as a template, and send updates via
email to the list. If you update the doc even with tracking turned on it
winds up with having to merge different versions and I end up being
secretary and I don't look food in a skirt. Drunken pictures of a
Montreal bachelor party out there will validate that!

If we can make changes very quick I would be happy to release it this
weekend and the Testing Part One next weekend although that depends on
how much work you all think this still needs. 

Please take a look and think of issues that are not covered and send
them to the list.

Mark,

Here are a few more items to beef up the access control section.

      Ensure that the application allows users to access only those functions and assets they are specifically authorized for. Verifiy that users are allowed to access assets and functions as described in the matrix.  Also verify that users cannot access assets and functions outside their authorization. Because this set is generally quite large, choose a set of specific tests to exercise the access control mechanism. For example, the least privileged user should attempt to access resources and functions of more privileged users. 
      Ensure that the access control mechanism is implemented in a centralized fashion, not distributed throughout the application. Ensure that the access control mechanism behaves consistently across the entire application. Distributed mechanisms are impossible to implement and configure correctly. 
      Verify that all accesses to the application are subject to the access control check. Attempt to access the application in a variety of ways that are outside the normal user's path. A proxy can be helpful here in generating communications that would not ordinarily be expected. 
      Evaluate whether the application relies on any external information to make access control decisions. Examine all information that enters the application and manipulate it to attempt to subvert the access control decision. A proxy can be useful here to manipulate these values. 
      Ensure that the application uses only the identity determined by the identification and authentication mechanism to make access control decisions. Verify that the application does not use any identifiers or names as a proxy for the authenticated identity. 
      Assets and functions shall be clearly associated with the information required to make access control decisions. Examine the assets and functions to be accessed by the application. It should be clear what part of the access control matrix they belong to. 
      Verify that both coarse-grained URL based access control and fine-grained access control to specific functions and assets is properly implemented. Attempt to access the application in a variety of ways that are outside the normal user's path. A proxy can be helpful here in generating communications that would not ordinarily be expected. 
      Verify that users have been assigned the minimum privileges and authorizations necessary to perform their tasks. Verify that users do not have privilege to perform functions that they do not need. 
      Ensure that administrators have been assigned the minimum privileges and authorizations necessary to perform their tasks. Verify that administrative users do not have privilege to perform unnecessary functions. 
      Verify that only the authorized types or modes of access to assets and functions are granted to users. If the application requires specific privileges, such as read, write, execute, etc., verify that these privileges are accurately enforced. Be sure that there is no way a user with read access can cause the system to perform a write function.

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Updated Pen Test Check List 



OK, sorry for the delay in this. I thought I would get to it last night 

but it took a little longer than I thought and some other things got in 

the way. 


I have tried to make everything as an "issue" that should be checked for 

and not a consequence or a technique. I have aligned this with OASIS WAS 

Vuln Types although there are a few issues I would like to still add. I 

have also removed the things that were techniques or consequences. 


Let me know what you think. I know we will need to add more issues etc 

but I hope the formatting and style is now consistent. 


If you like it I suggest we use this as a template, and send updates via 

email to the list. If you update the doc even with tracking turned on it 

winds up with having to merge different versions and I end up being 

secretary and I don't look food in a skirt. Drunken pictures of a 

Montreal bachelor party out there will validate that! 


If we can make changes very quick I would be happy to release it this 

weekend and the Testing Part One next weekend although that depends on 

how much work you all think this still needs. 


Please take a look and think of issues that are not covered and send 

them to the list. 


Cheers

The OWASP temp server is down again. 
 
I am updating the site for the conference. You can see the build server
here
 
I say we PDF it, and release tomorrow if that works for everyone else ?

Mark, 


Here are a few more items to beef up the access control section. 




Ensure that the application allows users to access only those functions
and assets they are specifically authorized for. 


Verifiy that users are allowed to access assets and functions as
described in the matrix.  Also verify that users cannot access assets
and functions outside their authorization. Because this set is generally
quite large, choose a set of specific tests to exercise the access
control mechanism. For example, the least privileged user should attempt
to access resources and functions of more privileged users. 




Ensure that the access control mechanism is implemented in a centralized
fashion, not distributed throughout the application. 


Ensure that the access control mechanism behaves consistently across the
entire application. Distributed mechanisms are impossible to implement
and configure correctly. 




Verify that all accesses to the application are subject to the access
control check. 


Attempt to access the application in a variety of ways that are outside
the normal user's path. A proxy can be helpful here in generating
communications that would not ordinarily be expected. 




Evaluate whether the application relies on any external information to
make access control decisions. 


Examine all information that enters the application and manipulate it to
attempt to subvert the access control decision. A proxy can be useful
here to manipulate these values. 




Ensure that the application uses only the identity determined by the
identification and authentication mechanism to make access control
decisions. 


Verify that the application does not use any identifiers or names as a
proxy for the authenticated identity. 




Assets and functions shall be clearly associated with the information
required to make access control decisions. 


Examine the assets and functions to be accessed by the application. It
should be clear what part of the access control matrix they belong to. 




Verify that both coarse-grained URL based access control and
fine-grained access control to specific functions and assets is properly
implemented. 


Attempt to access the application in a variety of ways that are outside
the normal user's path. A proxy can be helpful here in generating
communications that would not ordinarily be expected. 




Verify that users have been assigned the minimum privileges and
authorizations necessary to perform their tasks. 


Verify that users do not have privilege to perform functions that they
do not need. 




Ensure that administrators have been assigned the minimum privileges and
authorizations necessary to perform their tasks. 


Verify that administrative users do not have privilege to perform
unnecessary functions. 




Verify that only the authorized types or modes of access to assets and
functions are granted to users. 


If the application requires specific privileges, such as read, write,
execute, etc..., verify that these privileges are accurately enforced.
Be sure that there is no way a user with read access can cause the
system to perform a write function.

winds up with having to merge different versions and I end up being 


secretary and I don't look food in a skirt. Drunken pictures of a 


Montreal bachelor party out there will validate that! 




If we can make changes very quick I would be happy to release it this 


weekend and the Testing Part One next weekend although that depends on 


how much work you all think this still needs. 




Please take a look and think of issues that are not covered and send 


them to the list. 




Cheers 




Mark

But I have updated the site when it comes back online and set the
publication date for 2 weeks. This should give us enough time this week
to get any updates and proof read it. Hope that's OK with everyone ?

Also if anyone can add Jeffs additions and then PDF the file it would be
appreciated. When I PDF it the flowchart becomes unreadable.

Thanks.

Check-in: OWASP web app internet checklist (pdf)
Comments: Added Jeff's access control goodies and a couple of my own.
Reformatted the table.  Some of Jeff's may get more into the 'how' than was
intended for this checklist, but they are all valid controls so I put them
in.  I will also send over the word doc with tracked changes for any final
editorial decisions.

Check-in: OWASP web app internet checklist (doc)
Comments: as before, but with tracked changes.

On the topic of PDF creation: The reasons the pictures look shoddy are
because of the image compression used by default in an attempt to reduce the
file sizes.

In open office, use the file/export to pdf option and then choose 'press
quality'.
In acrobat, go into the pdf options and turn off the compression and image
re-rendering options.
 
Happy Easter!

hey!

Congrats to all, the new flow is cool and the whole thing looks just great!

I have no further comments about the "issues" just a few about the workflow (Dan?)

1. In some processes like "try to exploit the vulnerability" is not a decision point so I think the "Yes" flow arrow should not go there.
2. "Can you compromise the application with the vulnerability?" it is a decision point so it should be into a rhombus
3. "Is there information leakage?" has 2 "YES" flow arrows.
4. "Is the type of information business critical?" has no "NO" flow arrow
5. "Have all possible test being executed?" it is not "referenced", IMO the "YES" flow arrow from "Have all attack methods being exhausted and investigated?" should be pointing here.

Cheers

JC

Correct. The arrow from "Try and exploit" to "Did you succeed" should 
not have a "YES" on it

> rhombus 

Correct again.

> 3. "Is there information leakage?" has 2 "YES" flow arrows.

Correct. The "YES" should point to the "Is the type of information 
business critical" and the "No" of "Is the type of information 
business cricital" should point to "Go through each testing...."

>  4. "Is the type of information business critical?" has no "NO"

See above.

> 5. "Have all possible test being executed?" it is not
> "referenced", IMO the "YES" flow arrow from "Have all attack
> methods being exhausted and investigated?" should be pointing here.

Correct.

Also notice that there should be an arrow after "Contact the business 
organization". All the steps after the "YES" to "Attack succeded" 
should go back to the same phases since the main idea as the "NO" (in 
order for the cycle to be repeated)

I've been thinking about the flowchart a little bit. And attached is 
my proposal for it. I think it's easier to understand this way. I'm 
sorry it's not put in a "prettier form" (but I've done my best to 
re-route all connections)

Really nice improvements. I have three comments.

First, I think we should point out two key benefits: completeness and
accuracy.  Completeness is what distinguishes code review from almost every
other approach. Runtime approaches simply can't find problems in code that
doesn't execute.  Accuracy is also extremely important, and code review
produces very low rates of false alarms when compared to penetration
testing.

Second, I think we need to be very clear about whether "SCR is one of the
most efficient techniques" or whether it is "expensive" and "time consuming"
(really the same thing).  I have heard this objection to SCR from a number
of large companies and agencies -- and I don't want to encourage it unless
we really believe this.  In my experience, a reasonable SCR can be
accomplished in the *same* amount of time as a penetration test.  And the
findings will be far more complete and accurate.

Third, I disagree with the point that the review should always be by a
separate team or 3rd party. The most effective SCR is done as part of a peer
review process that has some real security guidelines to follow. Perhaps as
part of Part 2, we can include a checklist for thsi activity.  A 3rd party
review is useful at the right time to obtain some objective opinions.

Just a few opinions -- I'm obviously a huge advocate for SCR, but I'm trying
to be objective here. Let me know if this makes sense.

I agree the stuff is pretty good. I also agree with jeff's comments and have a couple of more suggestions, i think we should have another topic which talks more on the type of documentation that would be useful. 
basically DFD and application flow diagram type documents definately help understand the application code and application flow. what are your thoughts ?
 
nish.

Thank you Jeff

Phew! I can't belive I have time to read your comment until today. man...

so, First, great points. I totally agree, I'll be adding them as advantages.

Second, I guess the word better describes this is "effective" not "efficient", don't you thing?

Third. Right again. By Third party I mean another person/team, that is not necessarily someone out of your own team or company, a great example is just the one you mention, peer reviews.  In previous drafts I clarify this into a comment in parenthesis, I guess shouldn't get rid of it.

Thank you again,
JC

IMHO the "Use what you have learned" should be a different topic or issue (as well if you agree with Nish), I think that information in not part of an specific technique.

I agree the stuff is pretty good. I also agree with jeff's comments and have a couple of more suggestions, i think we should have another topic which talks more on the type of documentation that would be useful. 
basically DFD and application flow diagram type documents definately help understand the application code and application flow. what are your thoughts ?
 
nish.

You know, I've reviewed a lot of code and I don't generally want to see much
design documentation.  In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention
that I seem to be in the minority on this point -- at least among the code
review experts at Aspect.

But there are two important points to consider here.

1) The documentation is NOT TRUTH.  The truth is in the code.  Everything
else is a model or an abstraction.  Very often the code does not work like
the documentation says it should.   So if you do look at docs, you better
have a very skeptical eye.  Remember, NOBODY DOCUMENTS VULNERABILITIES.

2) You don't always have time to review both the documentation AND the code.
I believe your time is better spent in the code, since that's where the
problems are.  Reviewing the documentation can take weeks that soak time
from the effort.  It's just a question of where your hours are best spent.

If a code reviewer is really skilled at reading code for security, having a
ton of documenation is really not necessary.  If it is, that's a problem
with the code, since if the reviewer can't quickly understand it, neither
can anyone else.  And if you can't understand how an application protects
itself or how the security mechanisms work, they're almost certainly broken.

IMHO the "Use what you have learned" should be a different topic or issue
(as well if you agree with Nish), I think that information in not part of an
specific technique.

Juan,

Attached is the edited version.

I do agree with some of Jeff's points, but i also prefer the fresh eye 
approach. When developers spend a large amount of time on a project, 
its possible they overlook certain area's (how many of us here have 
done this when coding something simple?)

Also, ive taken out the 8d as i feel its the same as the compliance 
certificate in some way.

Sorry guys, I got knocked out by a few Hurricanes (in joke for those who
have visited the French Qtr in New Orleans). I will make sure I get this
draft complete this weekend. Its way overdue and people are asking for it.
Sorry.

It seems its all low-level network stuff.

Hopefully the OWASP con in june will balance things out

OK so I have been away for a while and this is now hopelessly late again
(my fault entirely) but I have just picked up the document and I am very
confused / daunted at the editing that MAY be needed.

1. Chapter 2 Principles - Was it never finished (or did I miss
something)?
2. Chapter 4 - Reviews and Manual inspections - doesn't this (content
wise) really overlap with the Testing Framework chapter?

I am reasonably happy with most of this document (knowing Chapters 2, 5
and 6 need completing). 

However Chapter 4 IMHO just doesn't fit into the rest of the document in
either its style, content or length. I think its great content just it
doesn't read well and is far too long in comparison to the rest of the
document and I just don't know where to start.

That is so awesome. I would really like to be able to get this out later this week (before end of month) as we have long promised. 

The main challenge is that Chapter 4 doesn't fit from a grammatical, length or content perspective. 

The aim of this Part 1 is to be the What, Why, When, Where of Tetsing with Part 2 being the How. Ie aprt from the Testing Framework we should just be introducing concepts, techniques and ideas. Part 2 will cover details HOw To's.

Could we get an updated draft by Friday ?

Yes, Friday is fine. It's only 48 pages.
 
If I have specific comments for particular authors to understand what they've written, I would post to the testing list?

I agree, I can send a new draft for "White Box" on Friday, I guess I have to rewrite some paragraphs and summarize in one the "sensitive points" stuff. You think that would that would help to focus more on the What, Why, When, Where?

I'm specially confused about how  "What" and "Where" apply to this sub-section.  People, please provide guidance...,

Yes, Friday is fine. It's only 48 pages.
 
If I have specific comments for particular authors to understand what they've written, I would post to the testing list?
 
thanks,
Andrew

	That is so awesome. I would really like to be able to get this out later this week (before end of month) as we have long promised.
	
	The main challenge is that Chapter 4 doesn't fit from a grammatical, length or content perspective.
	
	The aim of this Part 1 is to be the What, Why, When, Where of Tetsing with Part 2 being the How. Ie aprt from the Testing Framework we should just be introducing concepts, techniques and ideas. Part 2 will cover details HOw To's.
	
	Could we get an updated draft by Friday ?
