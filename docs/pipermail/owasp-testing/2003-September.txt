Guys,

It is with dissapointment that I have to say I have absolutely no idea now how to track David Endler down or what stage this project is at. I have left him voice mail and email for the last two weeks but to no avail. 

We have tried over the last 18 months to get this going and now with two significant false starts, I am not sure I have any optimism for it left and am drawing the conclusion that it maybe one we just have to put down to experience. This is of course a shame as this is much needed work and in much demand, but without a driver making it happen it will sit in this state forever and given the significant progress other projects are making it is not conclusive to good housekeeping to have an inactive project.

If there is anyone who feels they have the time, commitment, skills and motivation to take the helm and make this happen pretty quick, then please contact me within the next week. If not I am afraid to say we are going to have to delete it. 

Thanks to all of you who put effort into the project and I am personally sorry it appears to have died a slow and painful death. I will try and salvage what work was done in some way in the future.

FYI - The Guide is coming along very nicely. This too hit some sticky patches. Thanks mainly to 4 (read small group) now spending a significant amount of time on producing version 2, it will be a great read. 

Kind regards and again thanks for your efforts,


Mark

I'm happy to play an active part in this one - but I'm off to Thailand
for a month tomorrow and won't be back on-line until mid October.

I'll get back in touch then and offer my services!

It is very unfortunate to see this mail from you Mark. I wish i could take
the responsibility, but i dont think i have that great skills to manage this
project.  

But, if any senior person is taking the responsibility then i can definitely
take the initiative to assist them. 

To all other members of this wonderful project, please co-operate and take
this further up the ladder. We just cant see our dream baby going away
without coming into the world.

Some great news......Penny Major has graciously stepped up to the plate and offered to project manage testing. This is great news. Penny and I briefly discussed changing the way the project would operate using oFlow and getting authors to create discrete write-ups on individual topics that can later be combined into the overall testing document. I will leave it all up to her from here on in.

I believe a template will follow and a list to sign-up to write content.

Thank Penny, you da woman !

No one is active. That was the problem. Less email, more authoring would go
along way! Its your project, and you need to create the content.

I just sent a mail introducing Penny Major as the new PM. I would suggest
mailing Penny, getting a task and commiting it to the CVS.

Thanks penny. Wasn't all of the content already written? I thought we left off on editing, and agreeing on
the final draft. It has been a long time since this was discussed so I may be partually wrong....

Hi everyone,
 
I guess my first steps are just a couple of housekeeping activities.  I'm sure we'd all like to see a bit of a roll call to see who's still out there and willing to be active on this project.  So if everyone who hasn't responded over the last couple of days can send an quick e-mail out to the team and let us know your status, it would be appreciated.  
 
I'm going to go back in the mailing list and see exactly where we left off.  I'll dig up what I think is the most current documentation we have (I think it was sent out at the end of March) and we'll go from there.  
 
penny

Thanks penny. Wasn't all of the content already written? I thought we left off on editing, and agreeing on
the final draft. It has been a long time since this was discussed so I may be partually wrong....

Hi everyone,
 
I guess my first steps are just a couple of housekeeping activities.  I'm sure we'd all like to see a bit of a roll call to see who's still out there and willing to be active on this project.  So if everyone who hasn't responded over the last couple of days can send an quick e-mail out to the team and let us know your status, it would be appreciated.  
 
I'm going to go back in the mailing list and see exactly where we left off.  I'll dig up what I think is the most current documentation we have (I think it was sent out at the end of March) and we'll go from there.

Hi all,
 
I'm sorry I didn't get back to Mark in time for the email sent out last
week, I'm just now catching up with this thread.  Indeed, it seems
better to reliquish managerial control to someone who has more extra
time, and I wish it would have been me as this topic is near and dear to
my heart.  Things have not settled down as much in work and personal
life as I'd have hoped to allow a more active approach to the project.
I will continue to be involved in this group once a new project manager
comes on board, and I look forward to working with you all still.
Thanks for all your efforts to date and believing in the web app testing
mission.

	Mark,
	 
	    This idea sounds very interesting. It appears that it will
allow for easier collaboration taking the load off of the project
manager as regards to being the integrator of the document as well as
being the editor. Looking forward to seeing it when it is done.

		Jim,
		 
		Thanks for your mail and I agree that it will be a real
shame if it dies. However given its current status I am not sure that
making it more strategic to OWASP is a good idea.
		 
		I do however have another idea that you guys may like.
It will require a small Java app (some simple jsp's) that someone will
need to write and will still need someone to step forward and manage
this project but I think its more manageable and would work well.
		 
		The portal developers have built a tool called oFlow.
Its is not quite done but will be online in about 6 weeks. Essentially
its a document management system with full document workflow from a
browser. You can cut and paste html into a form and route it for
approval and then automatic publication on the portal. We can do many
things using it from a news blog to online editing of typos on doc
projects or web pages. It can also be used for people to submit
whitepapers and links to the portal as well.
		 
		We could use it to allow this group to submit individual
texts on testing for specific issues which could then be pulled together
into one document at a later date. oFlow is backended by DocBook.
		 
		If this would work and there is a new project manager in
the wings (I heard from 2 who are considering) that could assign the
tasks needed and approve or reject content then I think it maybe an
alternative way of working that is easier to get going and more
acheiveable. What do you all think ?

Penny,

Thanks again for stepping up to charge ahead with the project.  This is
the last good draft of everyone's edited work to date of the first
chunk.  

The first section is pretty much ready to be published on the owasp web
site (it's currently in openoffice format), it's been pretty heavily
edited and provides a raodmap for a lot of the content to be written.
But I leave that to you and the group to decide.

I'm here to help,

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] OWASP Web Security Survey
Message-ID: <003a01c37802$cb58fba0$6d7106d1@markc2000>

Team,

As you know we are in the process of conducting a survey on the state of web
security. Whilst we have a good response so far, the more data points we get
the better and more meaningful the survey will be.

As a project member or project follower your views are very important for us
to capture and we really need completed surveys from you all by end of day
Friday. Please take 15 mins and complete the survey to help make this
process a truly unique and accurate account of what you the experts think
about web security today.

The survey is linked from http://www.owasp.org.

Thanks

Mark

That is a real bugger to hear.
from where we left off, what still needs to be done? 
 
i still see the testing guide fitting in well with the WebGoat project, ie user tries form validation, gets in a muddle and clicks on help and the testing guide section pops up and explains it all
 
We can't let this stop right here, the guide is looking great

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Testing Project


Guys,
 
It is with dissapointment that I have to say I have absolutely no idea now how to track David Endler down or what stage this project is at. I have left him voice mail and email for the last two weeks but to no avail. 
 
We have tried over the last 18 months to get this going and now with two significant false starts, I am not sure I have any optimism for it left and am drawing the conclusion that it maybe one we just have to put down to experience. This is of course a shame as this is much needed work and in much demand, but without a driver making it happen it will sit in this state forever and given the significant progress other projects are making it is not conclusive to good housekeeping to have an inactive project.
 
If there is anyone who feels they have the time, commitment, skills and motivation to take the helm and make this happen pretty quick, then please contact me within the next week. If not I am afraid to say we are going to have to delete it. 
 
Thanks to all of you who put effort into the project and I am personally sorry it appears to have died a slow and painful death. I will try and salvage what work was done in some way in the future.
 
FYI - The Guide is coming along very nicely. This too hit some sticky patches. Thanks mainly to 4 (read small group) now spending a significant amount of time on producing version 2, it will be a great read. 
 
Kind regards and again thanks for your efforts,
 
 
Mark

Hi everyone,
 
I guess my first steps are just a couple of housekeeping activities.  I'm sure we'd all like to see a bit of a roll call to see who's still out there and willing to be active on this project.  So if everyone who hasn't responded over the last couple of days can send an quick e-mail out to the team and let us know your status, it would be appreciated.  
 
I'm going to go back in the mailing list and see exactly where we left off.  I'll dig up what I think is the most current documentation we have (I think it was sent out at the end of March) and we'll go from there.

Some great news......Penny Major has graciously stepped up to the plate and offered to project manage testing. This is great news. Penny and I briefly discussed changing the way the project would operate using oFlow and getting authors to create discrete write-ups on individual topics that can later be combined into the overall testing document. I will leave it all up to her from here on in.
 
I believe a template will follow and a list to sign-up to write content.
 
Thank Penny, you da woman !

That's a great idea.  I'd be happy to integrate the content into WebGoat (or
link to it appropriately).  Will the testing doc be organized around tests
for particular vulnerabilities?
