<PRE>After months of nothing really happening,which was my fault so 
apologies there, we are now ready to kickstart the 2nd phase.
Recently i've subscribed a large amount of people to the list and i'm 
hoping we have more interaction this time around.

I have drawn up a schedule for this second phase and it looks like:

1st May: Final version of the 2nd phase outline
15th May: 2nd phase broken up into sections where everyone can choose 
which section they want to contribute
31st May: Work starts on sections
15th July: All sections completed and sent in to me, so i can add them 
all to the main document
1st Aug: Proof reading begins
1st Sep: Release OWASP Testing guide
1st Oct: Multilingual versions released

As you can see, i've not gone totally made with the timescale, and 
think its totally doable in that timeframe, given the amount of 
contributors we have onboard.

If you can all review the current outline and give me feedback, we can 
get this project going again

Daniel
