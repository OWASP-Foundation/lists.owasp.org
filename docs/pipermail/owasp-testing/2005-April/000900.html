<PRE>I like the concept of a WAVA, as it does get away from the techniques that 
get used.  But I don't want to encourage anyone to think that a black box 
penetration test is a good way to get secure.  You don't learn anything 
useful from this kind of security testing.  And I don't think it's a good 
idea to promote the idea that you go from black-box to white-box.

I'd like to see us go in a direction where the testing guide encourages the 
use of the most cost-effective technique for detecting each type of problem 
(taking into account the particulars of the application being analyzed).

So, for example, if I think the most cost-effective way to find SQL 
injection in a particular application to use static analysis, I break out my 
favorite tool and find all the database accesses.  If there's one that looks 
like a hole, I might use WebScarab to demonstrate it to the customer (lots 
of value in this).  On that same WAVA, I might also use scanners and some 
manual code review to find problems.  I use the most cost-effective 
technique where it makes sense for the current application.

That's what makes sense to me.

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Ideas for WAVA Testing Overview &amp; Procedures 
Checklist documents


&gt;<i> Hi all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to I put forward another concept for consideration here. As
</I>&gt;<i> most people have been mentioning, there are two different perspectives
</I>&gt;<i> that you (as the application tester) normally adopt when you perform
</I>&gt;<i> your testing activities against the target system: black-box and
</I>&gt;<i> white-box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I feel there is a need to consider that perhaps these
</I>&gt;<i> perspectives (coined when security testing was all about
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure reviewing / pentesting) don't adequately reflect /
</I>&gt;<i> encompass the approaches adopted during Web Application security
</I>&gt;<i> reviewing (and here's another phrase that a previous colleague of mine
</I>&gt;<i> came up with which I feel might be more appropriate, to help get away
</I>&gt;<i> from the word &quot;pentest&quot;: Web Application Vulnerability Assessment, or
</I>&gt;<i> WAVA).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is that we consider defining an additional perspective:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Translucent box&quot; [or whatever name might be more appropriate here &#150; I
</I>&gt;<i> was just trying to find one that sort of conveyed the concept of
</I>&gt;<i> fitting in-between black &amp; white]), and that some or all of the actual
</I>&gt;<i> testing techniques, might be appropriate (and some not) depending on
</I>&gt;<i> which point of view you are approaching the application from &#150; and off
</I>&gt;<i> course, some testing procedures may need to be performed differently
</I>&gt;<i> depending on this perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These testing perspective definitions would be best suited to being
</I>&gt;<i> inclusions into the OWASPTesting_PhaseOne document (although I would
</I>&gt;<i> like to offer an alternative name for that too: something like the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Testing Overview&quot; or &quot;approach&quot; or &quot;guideline document&quot;, because, as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I see it, it actually covers a number of phases not just one),
</I>&gt;<i> and then the Web App Testing Checklist table could be expanded to
</I>&gt;<i> include a column for specifics about the testing phases from the
</I>&gt;<i> Overview document where the tests are appropriate, or should be
</I>&gt;<i> customised, etc And then the appendices to the checklist could be the
</I>&gt;<i> place to include specific examples of how to carry out those tests and
</I>&gt;<i> what the expected results are, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel it would be appropriate to define the testing perspectives
</I>&gt;<i> something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Black box - from the perspective of an anonymous, unauthenticated
</I>&gt;<i> user, with minimal knowledge about the target system
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Translucent box [or whatever name might be more appropriate here &#150;
</I>&gt;<i> I was just trying to find one that sort of conveyed the concept of
</I>&gt;<i> fitting in-between black &amp; white] &#150; from the perspective of a &quot;normal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> application user, where they have a login account (through whatever
</I>&gt;<i> means a &quot;normal&quot; user of the system gets assigned an &quot;authorised&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> login to it)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. White box &#150; from the perspective of a person with full system
</I>&gt;<i> access, and thus full access to the application code and servers, etc
</I>&gt;<i> [typically the level of access the system admin, application author,
</I>&gt;<i> system auditor might have]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then you can discuss how each of the testing procedures /
</I>&gt;<i> techniques / steps fit in with each of the above perspectives,
</I>&gt;<i> together with how they might or might not be appropriate in the
</I>&gt;<i> different testing perspectives, or might need to be modified to suit
</I>&gt;<i> the particular perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In each perspective there are a certain amount of activities to be
</I>&gt;<i> performed that fall into the common class of categories like:
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Planning
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Information gathering
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Target identification
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Service enumeration &amp; service information mining
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Automated testing procedures
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Manual testing procedures
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Feedback / report writing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, for example, in the traditional black box pentest, the pentester
</I>&gt;<i> might just be given a server name or IP address as the target (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> the anonymous user approach, with minimal information up front), and
</I>&gt;<i> he will be required to go through the usual testing steps like:
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Planning: understanding the security significance of the target and
</I>&gt;<i> why someone might want to compromise it;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Information gathering: querying public resources, whois records,
</I>&gt;<i> mailing lists, for information that may help, etc;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Target identification: ping sweeps, icmp vs tcp, etc
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Service enumeration (portscans) &amp; service information mining
</I>&gt;<i> (fingerprinting, harvesting service version info from what is returned
</I>&gt;<i> when you connect to them, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Automated testing using vulnerability scanners
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Manual testing procedures (weed out false-positives, perform
</I>&gt;<i> additional  checks to compliment the automated scanners, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Feedback / report writing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In an application security vulnerability assessment (WAVA) scenario,
</I>&gt;<i> the black box approach could be where the tester has been given the
</I>&gt;<i> specific URL or web server address only. Again the testing techniques
</I>&gt;<i> / steps / procedures might include:
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Planning: understanding the security significance of the target and
</I>&gt;<i> why someone might want to compromise it;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Information gathering: querying public resources, connecting to the
</I>&gt;<i> server with a browser and reading what information is presented, etc;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Target identification: HTTP vs HTTPS ports, SSL certificate
</I>&gt;<i> information, a lot of the work here could be considered more
</I>&gt;<i> traditional infrastructure pentest work, and sometimes we need to be
</I>&gt;<i> wary of being drawn too much into this when the primary target is the
</I>&gt;<i> web app, not necessarily the infrastructure [and yes, of course the
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure needs to be secure, which is what pure pentests are
</I>&gt;<i> there for&#133;]
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Service enumeration &amp; service information mining &#150; observing what
</I>&gt;<i> web application specific information is obtainable, noting the input
</I>&gt;<i> fields and variables, including hidden fields, client side scripting,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Manual testing procedures &#150; I'd say that an application tester is
</I>&gt;<i> likely to start with manual testing, and only get on to automated
</I>&gt;<i> testing when he has a better understanding of what functions are
</I>&gt;<i> performed by the application - testing areas like user authentication
</I>&gt;<i> processes (session manipulation / user escalation), input validation,
</I>&gt;<i> code injection, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Automated testing &#150; like sampling session management values (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> cookie) to assess for predictability, brute force password guessing,
</I>&gt;<i> code injection testing of input fields (i.e. SQL injection, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Feedback / report writing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a pentesting situation, translucent box testing might be testing
</I>&gt;<i> from the position of the DMZ or corporate network, where you have
</I>&gt;<i> access behind firewalls, etc. Not quite administrative access, but
</I>&gt;<i> closer to the level of access that a normal (a.k.a. &quot;corporate&quot;) user
</I>&gt;<i> might have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the application (WAVA) tester, the translucent box testing can be
</I>&gt;<i> seen to be where the tester is given example user accounts for users
</I>&gt;<i> of different levels of privilege (from the application's perspective,
</I>&gt;<i> not the operating system perspective!). And then your manual testing
</I>&gt;<i> activities take on a whole new angle where you attempt to see if you
</I>&gt;<i> can call admin level menu functions while only logged in as a
</I>&gt;<i> low-privileged user, see how cross-site scripting might allow a
</I>&gt;<i> low-privileged user to escalate their privileges to those of the admin
</I>&gt;<i> level user, or even to gain unauthorised access to records of other
</I>&gt;<i> low-privileged users, etc.  For the translucent box perspective you
</I>&gt;<i> can take the manual testing procedures phase (as just one of the items
</I>&gt;<i> on its own) and expand it into sub categories, like:
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; User Authentication and Authorisation mechanisms - test a user's
</I>&gt;<i> ability to perform unauthorised tasks such as: Access data or
</I>&gt;<i> resources that they are not entitled to; Escalate their current
</I>&gt;<i> privileges; Transact as another user; Access resources after logoff /
</I>&gt;<i> session timeouts; etc
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Access Protection controls - test access protection mechanisms over
</I>&gt;<i> system resources, e.g. testing if a user can: Gain unauthorised access
</I>&gt;<i> to system files, data or other resources; Circumvent the access
</I>&gt;<i> protection controls using atypical methods such as alternate character
</I>&gt;<i> sets, or URL munging / manipulation / fuzzing, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Data Validation - test the application for its vulnerability to data
</I>&gt;<i> injection and insertion techniques (buffer overflows, string
</I>&gt;<i> formatting problems, etc), i.e. test if the application: Correctly
</I>&gt;<i> parses any data inputted by the user; Performs adequate bounds
</I>&gt;<i> checking; Performs adequate validation of any data inputs; etc
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Session Management - assess whether a user can: Steal or highjack
</I>&gt;<i> the credentials or session of another user; Change their current
</I>&gt;<i>identity to that of another user (account or role &quot;hopping&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> Manipulate or falsify the session management controls for any other
</I>&gt;<i> means; etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, while doing translucent box testing, the WAVA tester will gather
</I>&gt;<i> new information that would be useful to try from the black-box WAVA
</I>&gt;<i> perspective &#150; like trying to call internal web app functions before
</I>&gt;<i> you are authenticated with the server (e.g. I have encountered
</I>&gt;<i> situations where simply connecting to the login page / function and
</I>&gt;<i> being issued with a session ID / cookie allowed me to call a function
</I>&gt;<i> that lists the transaction record &#150; in other words the authorisation
</I>&gt;<i> procedures were not being invoked when that function was called, all
</I>&gt;<i> that it looked at was that a session ID in the correct format was
</I>&gt;<i> included within the user's POST request&#133;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then you get on to the white-box testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the pentest situation, I'd be more inclined to call this the
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure hardening review / audit &#150; with admin level access you
</I>&gt;<i> review operating system settings and installed applications; IT
</I>&gt;<i> department organisation reviews; change control procedures; disaster
</I>&gt;<i> recovery planning; and all the other normal audit / compliance
</I>&gt;<i> objectives&#133;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The white-box testing in the WAVA situation could be where you include
</I>&gt;<i> categories of activities like code reviews / audits, architectural
</I>&gt;<i> design reviews, interviewing developers, threat modelling, DRP, change
</I>&gt;<i> control procedures, etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
