Subject: [Owasp-testing] spreadsheets for testing guide / top ten
Message-ID: <40a166ad0912131954m47b8551bidd2b541d07892d13@mail.gmail.com>

A while back there was a thread discussing the need for a spreadsheet
version of the testing guide (see;
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2008-May/001540.html) . i
think the debate was mainly centered around whether or not an xls file would
be acceptable.

I was wondering if anything like this had been published?

I've created versions in the past. I think it definitely makes sense to
offer this as a supplement to the OWASP testing guide (and top 10), based on
how many testers like to "check-off" portions of a test.

Thoughts?

Perhaps consider ASVS, there is an XML version you could use, see the

Cool, i'll check that out. In the meantime, here's a spreadsheet version of
the 2010 Top10.

The XMl version is pretty good, what we'd need is something that wouldn't
require net access and could be easily archived with every test. As much as
I dislike Excel, it does tick the boxes (excuse the pun) when it comes to
testing apps and being thorough.

FYI, the Top 10 in general isn't criteria, it's a datasheet.

It's very incomplete, for your purposes.

If you open asvs.xml using Excel, then you can save it as an Excel spreadsheet.

Download this: http://owasp-asvs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/asvs-xml.zip

Unzip, then open asvs.xml, can accept defaults when importing, then can save as, then can add whatever columns to hold whatever test data.

Michael,

Totally agreed, I was hesitant to put it out for that purpose.

The ASVS is fantastic, splitting the verification of an application into
levels. Exactly what i've been looking for. This project should be
publicized more!

Look at the keep session cookies flag.
Assuming that the session is maintained using cookies.

Add a header with the cookie in the request:

wget --header "Cookie: name=value"

More details:

Also curl can be useful in this case.

Hi Zaki,

If you mean in how you can get authenticated to a web application, you
can simply use the following command.

wget --http-user=USER --http-passwd=PASSWORD in case that your webapp
is using Apache Basic authentication.

As ra?l pointed in other mail, the use of the flag: --header "Cookie:
name=value" should work as well.

In my case, I used Paros Proxy in order to crawl a website once I'm
authenticated.

Cheers!

Hello,

I want to do a blackbox testing web application to test from Internet.
I knew the program language use is PHP but I haven't figured out the
database being used.

How do I perform database fingerprinting blackbox testing from
Internet? Any hint?

Have you been able to retrieve any error messages from the database while testing for SQL injection?

Thanks,

You can use a tool like sqlmap[1] to fingerprint.

Or just try to add sql to any form field.

example ' OR 1=1

If the query is not formatted properly you might get some kind of
error message.

Hi Zaki,

As many fellows recommend you, use some basic SQL injection strings
like: ' OR 1=1-- or " OR 1=1--

Outside, are a lot of more strings that you can use in order to see if
the webapp is using a DB at the Backend side.

Look this sheets:

Thanks for all the responses

I haven't got any error messages. This site doesn't have many form except:
- authentication: userid and password
- quantity of the goods

I have tried both, inserting SQL injection command and it failed.
Sigh, this web applicationis good at handling input.

How do I do sqlmap to authenticated page?

This site has dynamic GET parameters. This web application
automatically redirects to its home address if I hit this URL[1]
without being succesfully authenticated.

Have you considered that authentication might be LDAP? You might need a LDAP injection instead of SQL, although similar they are not the same. 

Also, try 
- commenting using # instead of -- for old MySql
- using or 1=1 -- (no quotes) in case of numeric user id
- using or ''||'1' = '1' -- for identifying oracle
- closing parenthesis ' or 1=1) for applications filtering --
- using other operators ' or 'a' like 'a' -- for operator filtering
- and many more on http://ferruh.mavituna.com/sql-injection-cheatsheet-oku/
- if nothing works try more sophisticated filter evasion techniques http://www.steve-shead.com/2009/08/11/cross-site-scripting-cheat-sheet/
- And you might want to read the OWASP Sql Injection prevention Cheat Sheet as you might be facing some of the countermeasures there http://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet

If you are able to make one successful request the others are pretty much simpler

Hi all,

I want to know what is the process to get involved in this OWASP
testing project. I had good experience on doing web security
assessments and I think I have a lot of good things to contribute for
the next version of the Testing guide.

Thanks

Try sqlin into every legitimate Request(post, get, headers) and observe if
it's injectable.
If the application is not prone to show error messages, then blind sqlin is
the possible way to fingerprint and test sqlin.

Glad to hear it. Matteo is heading up the project currently, so he's better
suited to say where help is needed.

What would you contribute? Anything you feel is missing?

Message-ID: <b30f17480912210117x5ada5f15n1ef56e8d54f555cf@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, sorry if this email is being considered OOT

I need a review on fyodor's nmap book. On the sites, (example[1]) said
half of the book are available online but from the manual[2] said ...

NMAP BOOK

While this reference guide details all material Nmap options, it can?t
fully demonstrate how to apply those features to quickly solve real-world
tasks. *For that, we released Nmap Network Scanning: The Official Nmap
Project Guide to Network Discovery and Security Scanning.*

Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks with
the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided for common
Nmap tasks such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks.

Examples and diagrams show actual communication on the wire. More than
half of the book is available free online. See http://nmap.org/book for
more information.

Hi Daniel,

I know that Mateo is the Project Lead of OWASP Testing, since the
OWASP guidelines state that if somebody has doubts can ask them on the
List, so, I tried this way, but, definitively I will contact Mateo to
see what he says.

My 1st contribution was the translation to the Spanish language of the
OWASP Newsletter with other colleagues but I would like to work on
other projects, this time, I would like to contribute with the OWASP
Testing guide next release and if all finish successfully, then go to
other interesting Projects.

Thanks for your reply 8-)

Hi Zaki,

I think that you are referring to how to footprint the authentication
mechanisms used by an application, if this is the one that you are
looking I would recommend that there are two different type of
authentication mechanisms (those are not the only ones) but in this
case, I'll mention those two:

   1. Apache based auth ->
      http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/auth.html
   2. Form based auth (traditional user/password login screen)

If you use Tools like Acunetix, you will see that there are two
options that you can use in order to get authenticated into the
application, you can record a session which uses the form based auth,
or you can choose the login/password used for Apache based auth, so, I
showed you those two options as a way to detect the type of mechanism
used for an app.

Hope this helps.

If I found something like this for authentication,

<applet>
   <param name=" " value="  ">
   <param name="  " value="  ">
    ...
</applet>

where is it on the list?

Hi,

You'd have to be more specific about this.
I assume these parameters reference a user/password combination?

There is no particular section in the Testing Guide that helps you identify
the exact authentication mechanism.
But the referenced page states: "... Testing the authentication schema means
understanding how the authentication process works and using that
information to circumvent the authentication mechanism."

There are numerous ways to perform authentication, so it does require an
'understanding' of how it works.
Do you feel the testing guide needs a section on this?

regards

Seba

I think the guide explains it well, as with any kind of testing, a strict
methodical approach needs to be taken. The enumeration of the functionality
and technology in use (as covered under Information Gathering).

Once armed with that info, it makes it easier to test. Section 4.4 does
cover a fair amount, granted there are some new techniques I use that would
be useful to add but there is enough in there to get results with 99% of the
apps out there currently.
