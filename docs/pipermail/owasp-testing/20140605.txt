Has the review process or even a timeline been defined yet?

It seems kind of backward to demote projects without having prepared the process by which they will be re-promoted or re-assessed. Or even high level timeline?
May ? Projects Demoted.
June ? Announce demotions and reasoning.
July ? Announce review process/criteria.
Aug ? Project members/leaders submit info/details, complete forms, whatever...
Sept ? Board reviews.
Oct ? Project status reset.
At least publishing something like that would give the community some sense of ?Ok things are moving/changing, and I have an idea what the plan and timelines are.? versus the current ?Ok things are in limbo, something might change, at some point, what next? What now??.

Now we have a community of users and contributors sitting with projects in some sort of status limbo. Which ?shouldn?t? have any major impact or their use etc but from the outside looking in I would be completely unsurprised if in 3 or even 6 months they?re still sitting in limbo. In which case we?re going to end-up doing ourselves a huge dis-service. Whether or not these statuses were ever meant to impact public perception or not, I believe they do.

Jim,

I do not believe that you intended to offend the other OWASP Projects that have maintained their flagship status, rather this is damaging oversight of the OWASP Board.

Your statement "Unfortunately, some of our flagship projects have not been active and have languished" does not apply to the v4 release of the OWASP Testing Guide which has been active for over a year.  I believe ZAP is also under active ongoing development too based on the announcements I have observed from Simon aka psiinon.

Can you please advise if a demoted OWASP Project would be required to adhere to a revised standard or the existing standard for flagship project will remain?

If so I would like to apply for the release of the OWASP Testing Guide v4 to be of flagship status?

The announcement on flagship status just went out to the leaders list and the main community list.

Christian, your concearns about my ulterior motive are totally fair. That is why this was a board vote (unanimous) and note a decision that was made on my own.

The next step is to simply re-apply for flagship (or similar) status once the new project rating mechanisms are in place.

I am sorry for anyone who was offended here. I hope the announcement explains why the board did what we did.

Aloha,
Jim

I think it would have been better for an agreed statement to go out at the same time as the demotion.
The 'silent' demotion doesnt send the right message - we should be very open in these sort of matters.

Cheers,

Simon

I personally agree that the testing guide is of flagship caliber. We
(the board) decided to drop all flagship projects down one notch to
"labs status" and ask that they all reapply for status. Here is text
that I proposed for the announcement; I'm waiting for board approval.

I can understand your concern here Christian. Heck, I even had a
project that I was managing demoted because it was not active.... I am
trying to be fair.

I'll rally the board and get

pushed to the community sooner than later.
