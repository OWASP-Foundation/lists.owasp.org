Hello,

have you included malicious applets in this testing guide? pdp had a nice
example at this years BH/Defcon?
This is a really powerful attack with XSS vulnerable sites and has a 50%
chance a user will let the applet run.

just a suggestion,

Eoin

Marco,
About section 4.8.1, please note that following the popup example there is
another example where the victim downloads an executable file (.exe) of the
attacker's choice.
