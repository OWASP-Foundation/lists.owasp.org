Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] It's here, the final release of phase one
Message-ID: <51240.194.203.201.168.1102671283.squirrel@194.203.201.168>

Morning all,

So here it is, the version which will be appearing on the sourceforge
servers soon (Mark, can you give me a hand getting this document
uploaded?)

Obviously this first phase is very light on content and doesn't really
merit any quotes from various people in the industry, i'd rather save that
for the second phase.

Over the christmas period, i'll be drawing up the plans for the 2nd phase
and also helping Mark/Jeff get the Flexwiki site up and running.

Let me know what you think

Daniel

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Farewell OWASP, take care!
Message-ID: <200412220251.VAA19894@wellington.cnchost.com>

People,

Its with a degree of sadness that I have decided to leave the OWASP project
behind and move on to pastures new. This decision has been a long time
coming and not something I have decided to do without a lot of thought. When
we started it in 2000 I had no idea I would become so attached to this
virtual community. I really have. 

Sadly my na?ve vision of the utopian dream of lots of people coming together
and working in collaboration to build cool software and documentation just
hasn?t materialized the way I had hoped. I have actually become very
disillusioned with open source projects and simply feel my ever increasingly
limited time is best spent in other directions in which I personally get
more fulfillment and less frustration. At this point of my game I think the
majority of people want free software and not open source; a sad conclusion
that?s debatable but I think true. I wanted to produce high quality
documents and software and lots of it. Like Renuad Derason of Nessus fame I
am bitterly disappointed at the amount of people that take and don?t give
back to the community and as a consequence things just don?t seem to have
been moving in a positive direction at a pace I am comfortable with. For
OWASP the model was broken. We hear of companies having based commercial
policies on OWASP Guides and using the portal for Intranets, but we never
hear from them. I really believe that OWASP still has the potential to have
a huge impact on the web application security world but suspect it needs to
dramatically re-group and re-organize to achieve that goal. I know Jeff has
started that process.

I am certainly not disappearing from the software security scene, quite the
opposite. Foundstone is a phenomenal place to work and with the commercial
side of life, cool clients and interesting projects we just seem to be able
to get more fun stuff done. You will see a new project with a very different
model from OWASP (commercially backed, shared source)in the new year called
ThreatsandCountermeausures.com and lots of free software security tools from
Foundstone. These are not competitive to what OWASP is doing in anyway, just
different....and to me more rewarding at this point. I am one of those ADD
people that has to see progress every week or I get frustrated ;-) T&C by
the way was going to be an OWASP project until a radical left wing person
expressed their voice about MS and I just didn?t have the appetite to deal
with it anymore. This kind of thing is not constructive and needs to be
stopped if OWASP is to grow. Dinis finds a great balance and should be an
inspiration to us all IMHO. 

Like I said it is of the utmost importance that OWASP carries on to spurn
the marketing FUD from the likes of WASC and the web app firewall vendors.
The potential is huge and very important, the possibility of it failing is
not nice so I hope you folks huddle up and make it happen. I just ask one
thing please keep out the riff raff !!

I have met some people I regard as lifelong friends through OWASP. You know
who you are. Its has been a great ride. I thank you for your inspiration and
those long nights online, especially in the early days. Ingo, Alex, Endler,
Steve T, Dave, Dinis etc..I learnt a lot from you guys and everyone who has
been involved.

Anything you would have mailed me about for OWASP you can contact Jeff
Williams (jeff.williams at owasp.org)

I'll see you all at the OWASP conference in NYC which I wouldn?t miss for
the world !

Have a great Christmas and a peaceful new year!

Mark

Season's ho ho's

2005 will be a big year for the OWASP testing project and i will be
pushing hard next to get phase II completed by the summer (July).
There are now over 50 people subscribed to this list and yet only a small
handful have ever contributed (even offering advice/guidance on this list
counts as contribution).

We cannot carry on with this model,so the only way forward is for me to
cull the dead members and start again. Its not fair that a few people
offer their time and the others piggy back on that effort.

Early in the new year, i'll be sending out the structure for the second
phase so that everyone can offer their input. I think if we can agree on
what will be included, then work can start in Feb on the actual content.

But now.. enjoy your eggnog, be nice when you get yet another pair of
socks from your mum-in-law and have a good break.

Mark,

Thanks for all that you have done for OWASP.  I've enjoyed working with you 
and the application security community will miss you greatly.

OWASP can play a major role in the application security market, but we need 
the help of the talented people on these lists.  If we work together, we can 
promote unbiased sensible security that will help the world become a place 
where software can be trusted.

It's always difficult when a great leader like Mark leaves an organization, 
but it also creates an opportunity for new leaders to rise to the challenge. 
OWASP is seeking people to lead projects to create tools and documentation. 
Taking on this role is time-consuming, but extremely rewarding, both 
personally and professionally.  I strongly encourage anyone who wants to 
understand application security more deeply to take on a project and lead it 
to success.

Thanks for everything Mark, and good luck in your new adventures...

--Jeff

Well, I for one would probably not have got half as far as I have 
without Mark's inspiration, assistance and encouragement.

I didn't see the original email that he wrote (guess it didn't make it 
to OWASP-leaders yet), but I certainly think it will be a crying shame 
if OWASP loses Mark's leadership.

I have also felt the disappointment of starting an open source project, 
and getting practically no feedback loop. WebScarab has been in progress 
for almost 2 years (longer if you count the design stages), and even 
now, I get feedback from maybe 3 or 4 users, on a completely sporadic basis.

In some ways, I guess I am as much to blame, for not letting people know 
what is happening, but it can really be demoralising to think that 
something you have devoted significant hours of your life to is not 
making a difference to anyone else.

Add that to the other responsibilities of juggling a career and a 
family, and it is not surprising that Mark is losing interest.

I'm afraid that this is a hallmark of modern societies. I think that the 
number of givers is FAR outweighed by the number of people who are 
prepared to be takers, if the situation allows them to.

It is really sad when people who do not contribute demoralise the ones 
who have contributed so much, and still have so much that they could 
still bring to the community.

I feel honoured to have been a (rather insignificant) part of that early

Dinis,

 

Your impassioned open letter is much needed and, hopefully, not too late.  I
support at least a large part of your thoughts on this subject and am keen
to see progress made in much the way you advocate.  However, a few
observations from my personal POV:

 

1.	I would suggest that the success of Open Source projects is directly
related to the nature and motivation of the community they serve.  Linux
succeeded in large part due to the fact that such a "product" was immensely
useful to its participants, who in large part were geeks who wanted to roll
their own "better" *NIX system.  More than intellectually challenging, it
provided a product that many individuals could use.  However, looking at the
OWASP community, I would suggest that the population is more oriented to
Enterprises (like my company) and Software Shops.  This immediately places a
different slant on participants' motivations.  
2.	I don't profess to speak for anyone but myself here, but my openly
selfish objectives are two-fold: (a) align my company's efforts with
emerging de facto standards and (b) gain leverage for my seven-figure budget
in application security.  My preference is to do that with an "open"
standard and not with a vendor and if I can collaborate with my peers in
other organizations, that's even better.  However, by the same token, I do
not want to squander my hard-won budget on projects that do not deliver
within the timeframe I need.  Right now, I find it difficult to contribute
unless I know that the efforts will bear fruit within reasonable time and
that is a basic project management issue: project sponsorship and
commitment.  I am willing to contribute cash, hosted CMS systems and active
staff participation, but I owe it to my company and its shareholders that
this contribution achieves results.  In short, I need guarantees that OWASP
will be a force multiplier to my efforts.  If you want to take OWASP out of
academia and a pure hobbyists' realm, my suggestion is that OWASP needs to
recognize these commercial needs.  
3.	This appears to me a classic project management issue: most projects
fail when there is limited "skin in the game" (read "money") and when
project accountability is weak.  My advocacy of a strong governance
structure is targeted at exactly this issue.  Membership funding focuses the
mind.
4.	Strong management, well funded, but who are held accountable for
deliverables, is one way to approach this.  This is the model the FS-ISAC
uses and I suggest we need a similar model. That OWASP was born and survived
so long is, in my mind, testimony to Mark's inspirational qualities, but it
is not a scalable architecture.  True governance is needed to deflect some
of my dollars to the project.

Subject: An Open Letter to Owasp

 

Owasp is in a Crisis!

Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of the
most active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his
reasons for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an
environment where the necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:
    a) prevents the departure of other key players and 
    b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that Mark (and others) will
want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.

As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues to be
a big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of
measures and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end
of this 'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my personal
opinion on several issues which I think are very relevant to the current
Owasp environment/situation.

A) My comments on .... "Owasp's vs Open Source"

Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the moment, in the
Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source should
deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD LIKE
to happen.

I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting the
concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).

Hello Everyone,

 

Hopefully I don?t repeat what Dinis and Denis wrote in their emails. It is unfortunate that we need a key member like Mark to depart from OWASP to start a discussion on the direction of OWASP?s future.  Moving forward I hope we can start these types of discussion without key members leaving?

 

Let?s put things into perspective, I don?t know if OWASP needs a radical change and it?s going to crash and burn.  OWASP needs goals, a clear direction/roadmap, more organization, funding, and etc...   Basically, OWASP is a group of security gurus that need some direction and help in business development.  

 

IMHO to move things forward the following needs to be addressed:

 

1)      Governance ? Currently there is very little governance and IMHO this is the root of the problem.  I don?t think most security gurus have the desire to work on governance.  They rather work on security related issues.

 

I feel that OWASP?s future growth will be limited with the current governance.  Many points in both Dinis and Denis emails should be addressed and incorporated into OWASP governance. 

 

2)      Leadership ? With the current situation of OWASP I think Jeff is doing well.  He has been the OWASP leader for about 6 months and he achieved the following:

a.       OWASP Conference ? He was one of the key people in establishing the first ever OWASP conference.  We need to build on the conferences because this could be a good revenue generator.  

b.      OWASP Foundation - He setup the OWASP Foundation and I?m sure all legal areas were covered.  I think having a lawyer is beneficial.    

c.       OWASP Portal ? He was key in setting up the new OWASP portal.  It?s not the most ideal portal but it?s 100% better then the XML portal we had before.  We still have a way to go on the portal?.

d.      OWASP Local Chapters ? We now have local chapters.  The OWASP name is spreading and participation is growing via local chapters. I?m the NYC chair and our membership and meeting attendance is doing very well. 

 

I do think there is lack of a structured roadmap for OWASP.  Our projects and ideas are ad-hock. If something cool comes up we?ll do it.  There is no structured roadmap and this should be addressed by Jeff and the OWASP leaders.

 

3)      Revenue Generation & Sponsorship ? Let?s create a plan to address Dinis and Denis issues along with others.

 

4)      Participation ? We need to make it clear in each project on what you can do to participate.  Each project web page should have a standard what should be included.  I guess this goes back to governance.

 

I can go on and on but I won?t.  I suggest we have a meeting with all the larders to discuss the direction of OWASP.  I?ll volunteer to create a meeting agenda based on everyone?s feedback to Mark departure.   I can setup a GoToMeeting session for all of us.

 

Thanks,
Stan

Dinis,

 

Your impassioned open letter is much needed and, hopefully, not too late.  I support at least a large part of your thoughts on this subject and am keen to see progress made in much the way you advocate.  However, a few observations from my personal POV:

 

   I would suggest that the success of Open Source projects is directly related to the nature and motivation of the community they serve.  Linux succeeded in large part due to the fact that such a ?product? was immensely useful to its participants, who in large part were geeks who wanted to roll their own ?better? *NIX system.  More than intellectually challenging, it provided a product that many individuals could use.  However, looking at the OWASP community, I would suggest that the population is more oriented to Enterprises (like my company) and Software Shops.  This immediately places a different slant on participants? motivations.  
   I don?t profess to speak for anyone but myself here, but my openly selfish objectives are two-fold: (a) align my company?s efforts with emerging de facto standards and (b) gain leverage for my seven-figure budget in application security.  My preference is to do that with an ?open? standard and not with a vendor and if I can collaborate with my peers in other organizations, that?s even better.  However, by the same token, I do not want to squander my hard-won budget on projects that do not deliver within the timeframe I need.  Right now, I find it difficult to contribute unless I know that the efforts will bear fruit within reasonable time and that is a basic project management issue: project sponsorship and commitment.  I am willing to contribute cash, hosted CMS systems and active staff participation, but I owe it to my company and its shareholders that this contribution achieves results.  In short, I need guarantees that OWASP will be a force multiplier to my efforts.  If you
 want to take OWASP out of academia and a pure hobbyists? realm, my suggestion is that OWASP needs to recognize these commercial needs.  
   This appears to me a classic project management issue: most projects fail when there is limited ?skin in the game? (read ?money?) and when project accountability is weak.  My advocacy of a strong governance structure is targeted at exactly this issue.  Membership funding focuses the mind.
   Strong management, well funded, but who are held accountable for deliverables, is one way to approach this.  This is the model the FS-ISAC uses and I suggest we need a similar model. That OWASP was born and survived so long is, in my mind, testimony to Mark?s inspirational qualities, but it is not a scalable architecture.  True governance is needed to deflect some of my dollars to the project.
   I believe that the best part of the Open Source model ? widespread contributions by motivated individuals and academia, as well as peer review ? need not be lost, so long as there is recognition that the main audience for the products is large organizations.  One approach may be a paid membership, with fellowship status being awarded to individuals that have made significant contributions.

Dinis,

 

Because I work with the Microsoft community and sometimes has to represent
them, you should really read their papers and security step by step
regarding ASP.NET. I understand that there is a danger with the ASP.NET Full
Trust (that's why they recommend to develop ASP.NET partially trusted), but
all that is configurable using the CAS tool. In fact, in .NET 2.0, the CAS
tool cannot be turn off.

 

You should contact them, why not, you can find them at weblogs.asp.net
(Scott Guthrie). Maybe they haven't heard of you so that's why they haven't
contact you.

 

>I also find fascinating the fact that the current Owasp-dotNet leader (i.e.
me) has not been contacted by nobody from >the Microsoft Asp.Net team
regarding the Owasp-DotNet tools currently published:
>
>    - Asp.Net Security Analyzer (ANSA)

(SAM'SHE)

>The only logic explanation that I have for this situation (since these
tools DO actually work and have helped hundreds of >companies to improve
their Asp.Net hosting environments) is that Microsoft doesn't want to
'endorse' these tools >because all of them show how insecure and dangerous
the current Full Trust Asp.Net environment is.

 

 

And about the contribution, I offered sometime ago some ideas and a code
project. But the group never responded back, so I just posted in my web site
(http://www.ecyware.com/gbscripting.aspx?lnk=scripting). 

 

Regarding the future of OWASP, Mark made the best decision in my mind. The
open source idea is good, but there is a market idea in everything.

 

Best Regards,

Rogelio Morrell C.

Stanley, et al,

 

I took the liberty of holding a fact-finding discussion with three members
of The Center for Internet Security (CIS): Clint Kreitner (President/CEO),
Bert Miuccio, (Vice President) and John Banghart (Director of Benchmark
Services).  I've reproduced my notes on that meeting below.

 

In summary, CIS shares much the same purpose and history as OWASP.  Of
interest is that their organization experienced many of the same issues we
are facing now and has since thrived.  They currently have growing revenues
from a growing membership and government funding and while it has not been
plain sailing, they have succeeded.  Most importantly, they have expressed
interest in lending their experience to our discussions on the future of
OWASP.  I think we stand to learn much from this organization.

 

I strongly recommend inviting them to our next meeting and will facilitate
this, unless I hear string objections.

 

Please let me know your thoughts.

OWASP seems to share almost identical goals with CIS, in terms of the desire
to develop consensus standards for the benefit of the community at large.
Many of the challenges CIS faced early on in their development appear to be
very close to the challenges OWASP now faces.  It is reassuring to learn
that someone else has blazed a similar trail in the past and made it work.
With this in mind, here are the notes I took during my fact finding
discussion with CIS today, that attempts to reflect their opinion on key
topics of concern to us:

 

On critical success factors:

1.  CIS identified three critical success factors for an endeavor of this
nature:

-         Achieving a critical mass of highly respected people;

-         Having no direct competitors (in terms of organizational goals);
and

-         A simple governance structure (3 people) to avoid "death by
committee" for any initiatives.

2.  The membership list of organizations was the key credibility factor that
attracted critical mass.

 

On governance structure:

3.	Keeping things small was essential to getting things done.   
4.	They expanded the advisory board gradually and only after getting
critical mass in participation. 

 

On priorities:

5.	CIS recognized early on that large scale users of the standards
would be commercial, "end-user" organizations, such as Banks, manufacturing
companies, etc.  Delivery of commercial-grade standards suitable for such an
environment therefore was identified as a priority. 
6.	CIS decided early on to focus efforts on the delivery of these
standards and not to get distracted by activities that did not directly
contribute to these goals (e.g., conferences, committees, local chapters,
etc.).  This focused participation on what mattered most - product
development.

 

On initial funding:

7.	The initial source of funding was a membership drive via the SANS
community.  This was based on the promise to deliver high-value product. 
8.	No sponsorship was allowed from O/S vendors, in part due to the need
to maintain perceived independence. 

 

On developing ongoing revenue:

9.	Ongoing revenue has been maintained through continued delivery of
commercial grade products.  While some members have dropped off, more new
members join than leave and currently the trend is for increased membership.

10.	The project is now attracting government membership and funding. 
11.	Other services, such as training and product certification, have
been identified and actively developed, to provide alternate, sustainable
revenue streams. 

 

On project management:

12.	Projects are run to commercial project management standards.
Consultants are paid for the development of products to professional
standards. 
13.	Intellectual property, however, is not compensated.  Participation
in a consensus project is not compatible with exerting proprietary rights
over such material. 

 

On constituency and participants:

14.	Participation is open to all.  Membership, however, confers benefits
in the commercial licensed use of the standards and products, and influence
in the development of standards (see
http://www.cisecurity.com/membership.html
<http://www.cisecurity.com/membership.html>  for details).  
15.	Comment is sought - and received - from all parties, thus allowing
broad, non-commercial influence, comment and peer review. 

 

On "open source" involvement:

16.	Open input allowed.  Previously, member benefit was initial
involvement, early access, and, to some degree, exclusivity of access and
influence.  However, this did not succeed in attracting a critical mass of
active members.  CIS have now migrated to more open model and invite people
who use it, even if that use is free. 

 

On collaboration:

17.	CIS has always sought partnerships, such as with SANS.  This is
critical to achieving convergence, critical mass and in unifying the
"market". 
18.	CIS strives to identify working relationships that will help meet
its practical goals.  For example, CIS is actively pursuing such
relationships with the Apache Foundation. 

 

On dealing with vendors:

19.	CIS experienced some skepticism and resistance from vendors of O/S
software, early on in its endeavors.  CIS overcame this by working through
the vendors' customer base.  Vendors kept running into CIS, leading to
eventual recognition and mutual respect. 

 

On future collaboration between CIS and OWASP:

20.	CIS would be happy to share its experience with OWASP and, further,
to explore areas of cooperation, especially in the field of application
server security standards. 
21.	Furthermore, CIS is not adverse to exploring closer ties in
assisting OWASP in developing its governance model.

Subject: Re: [OWASP-TESTING] RE: An Open Letter to Owasp

 

Hello Everyone,

 

Hopefully I don't repeat what Dinis and Denis wrote in their emails. It is
unfortunate that we need a key member like Mark to depart from OWASP to
start a discussion on the direction of OWASP's future.  Moving forward I
hope we can start these types of discussion without key members leaving...

 

Let's put things into perspective, I don't know if OWASP needs a radical
change and it's going to crash and burn.  OWASP needs goals, a clear
direction/roadmap, more organization, funding, and etc...   Basically, OWASP
is a group of security gurus that need some direction and help in business
development.  

 

IMHO to move things forward the following needs to be addressed:

 

1)      Governance - Currently there is very little governance and IMHO this
is the root of the problem.  I don't think most security gurus have the
desire to work on governance.  They rather work on security related issues.

 

I feel that OWASP's future growth will be limited with the current
governance.  Many points in both Dinis and Denis emails should be addressed
and incorporated into OWASP governance. 

 

2)      Leadership - With the current situation of OWASP I think Jeff is
doing well.  He has been the OWASP leader for about 6 months and he achieved
the following:

a.       OWASP Conference - He was one of the key people in establishing the
first ever OWASP conference.  We need to build on the conferences because
this could be a good revenue generator.  

b.      OWASP Foundation - He setup the OWASP Foundation and I'm sure all
legal areas were covered.  I think having a lawyer is beneficial.    

c.       OWASP Portal - He was key in setting up the new OWASP portal.  It's
not the most ideal portal but it's 100% better then the XML portal we had
before.  We still have a way to go on the portal....

d.      OWASP Local Chapters - We now have local chapters.  The OWASP name
is spreading and participation is growing via local chapters. I'm the NYC
chair and our membership and meeting attendance is doing very well. 

 

I do think there is lack of a structured roadmap for OWASP.  Our projects
and ideas are ad-hock. If something cool comes up we'll do it.  There is no
structured roadmap and this should be addressed by Jeff and the OWASP
leaders.

 

3)      Revenue Generation & Sponsorship - Let's create a plan to address
Dinis and Denis issues along with others.

 

4)      Participation - We need to make it clear in each project on what you
can do to participate.  Each project web page should have a standard what
should be included.  I guess this goes back to governance.

 

I can go on and on but I won't.  I suggest we have a meeting with all the
larders to discuss the direction of OWASP.  I'll volunteer to create a
meeting agenda based on everyone's feedback to Mark departure.   I can setup
a GoToMeeting session for all of us.

 

Thanks,
Stan

Dinis,

 

Your impassioned open letter is much needed and, hopefully, not too late.  I
support at least a large part of your thoughts on this subject and am keen
to see progress made in much the way you advocate.  However, a few
observations from my personal POV:

 

1.	I would suggest that the success of Open Source projects is directly
related to the nature and motivation of the community they serve.  Linux
succeeded in large part due to the fact that such a "product" was immensely
useful to its participants, who in large part were geeks who wanted to roll
their own "better" *NIX system.  More than intellectually challenging, it
provided a product that many individuals could use.  However, looking at the
OWASP community, I would suggest that the population is more oriented to
Enterprises (like my company) and Software Shops.  This immediately places a
different slant on participants' motivations.  
2.	I don't profess to speak for anyone but myself here, but my openly
selfish objectives are two-fold: (a) align my company's efforts with
emerging de facto standards and (b) gain leverage for my seven-figure budget
in application security.  My preference is to do that with an "open"
standard and not with a vendor and if I can collaborate with my peers in
other organizations, that's even better.  However, by the same token, I do
not want to squander my hard-won budget on projects that do not deliver
within the timeframe I need.  Right now, I find it difficult to contribute
unless I know that the efforts will bear fruit within reasonable time and
that is a basic project management issue: project sponsorship and
commitment.  I am willing to contribute cash, hosted CMS systems and active
staff participation, but I owe it to my company and its shareholders that
this contribution achieves results.  In short, I need guarantees that OWASP
will be a force multiplier to my efforts.  If you want to take OWASP out of
academia and a pure hobbyists' realm, my suggestion is that OWASP needs to
recognize these commercial needs.  
3.	This appears to me a classic project management issue: most projects
fail when there is limited "skin in the game" (read "money") and when
project accountability is weak.  My advocacy of a strong governance
structure is targeted at exactly this issue.  Membership funding focuses the
mind.
4.	Strong management, well funded, but who are held accountable for
deliverables, is one way to approach this.  This is the model the FS-ISAC
uses and I suggest we need a similar model. That OWASP was born and survived
so long is, in my mind, testimony to Mark's inspirational qualities, but it
is not a scalable architecture.  True governance is needed to deflect some
of my dollars to the project.
5.	I believe that the best part of the Open Source model - widespread
contributions by motivated individuals and academia, as well as peer review
- need not be lost, so long as there is recognition that the main audience
for the products is large organizations.  One approach may be a paid
membership, with fellowship status being awarded to individuals that have
made significant contributions.

 

I welcome your challenge, but as with so many undertakings like this,
critical mass is needed.  I will continue to fund my own projects in this
area and will make good on my promise to contribute these artifacts when
done, but this will be done unilaterally until such time that enough of my
peers and colleagues in other organizations recognize the opportunity we
have to work more effectively under a new, revitalized OWASP organization.

Subject: An Open Letter to Owasp

 

Owasp is in a Crisis!

Mark's departure (who was one of the original Owasp members and one of the
most active and energetic participants) must make us all reflect hard on his
reasons for departure. Hopefully, this crisis will also create an
environment where the necessary changes are made to Owasp's world which:
    a) prevents the departure of other key players and 
    b) substantially change Owasp's behavior so that Mark (and others) will
want to (re)join, participate and collaborate.

As an Owasp member myself, and knowing (hoping?) that Owasp continues to be
a big part of my professional life, I would like to propose a series of
measures and suggestions for its future. These ideas are included at the end
of this 'Open Letter to Owasp, but firstly I would like to give my personal
opinion on several issues which I think are very relevant to the current
Owasp environment/situation.

A) My comments on .... "Owasp's vs Open Source"

Sorry If I am offending somebody, but I think that at the moment, in the
Owasp community, there are some expectations of what Open Source should
deliver which are not based on WHAT CAN happen but on what people WOULD LIKE
to happen.

I feel that several Owasp members (including Mark) are misinterpreting the
concepts of FREEDOM and FREE (as in beer, i.e. no cost).

Nice! I was also thinking of how the two organizations are complementary 
and have similar goals and the organizations could benefit from each others 
experience. I also have been involved with both organizations. I also think 
OWASP has been very successful especially in raising awareness and in 
setting standards where none existed. It's been slower then we would all 
like, but I think the OWASP Top ten and the guidelines have emerged as 
standards rapidly compared to other areas of security. In particular the 
2004 Visa security program that set security requirements for merchants 
references the OWASP guidelines. (url is below)  Although the wording is a 
little weak, in my experience consulting for several projects, it enough to 
get developers to take action where they wouldn't in the past.  In 2005 
Visa/MC (probably Jan) are coming out with a joint standards, hopefully 
they will strength the wording, but even if they don't OWASP is having a 
big impact on all of the web projects I'm involved with.

I short I see OWASP as already being a success and continuing to be a major 
player in information security.

I'm sure that there are many others as well, but another effort that has at least some overlap with OWASP is ISECOM (formerly ideahamster.org?).  Is there someone within OWASP looking at other organizations and efforts that overlap with OWASP goals, and determining what if anything the organizations should do together?

While ISECOM is international, it seems to have originated, and is still head-quartered, in Spain. Here is the contact information for the founder and leader of ISECOM:

Pete Herzog - Managing Director - pete at isecom.org
ISECOM - Institute for Security and Open Methodologies
