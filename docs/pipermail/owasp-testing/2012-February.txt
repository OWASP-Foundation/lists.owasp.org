I need some help regarding mobile apps security testing if anyone could 
guide me in that area. Is there any security check list for android 
application? what are the vulnerabilities may exists in it?

We should also have a section in OWASP testing guide v4 for mobile 
applications.

Your advice would be very helpful.

Thank you,

Adnan Baig

Hi all,

I would like to invite you to participate in a survey investigating the effort required to discover web application input validation vulnerabilities given different scenarios - a topic that needs further exploration. This survey is carried out by a research group from the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.

By completing this survey you will:

  * Help the community to quantify relevant properties related to the discovery of web application input validation vulnerabilities.
  * Be able to compare your answers to the answers of others.
  * Have the chance to win a 100 USD gift certificate on Amazon.

The survey can be found at: http://surveys.ics.kth.se/WASecurity

Please contact us if you have any questions related to this study.

Thank you for your attention and sorry about the cross-posting.

Regards,
Hannes
