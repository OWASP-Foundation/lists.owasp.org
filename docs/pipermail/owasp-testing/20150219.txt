Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP BWA Abandon?
Message-ID: <D81E88D0EF514642A4B5945241B227C30307B2C261@MBX08.bell.corp.bce.ca>

I've been trying to reach Chuck Willis via his OWASP address, without any luck (http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/20150209/thread.html). To find out if BWA (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Broken_Web_Applications_Project) has been abandon.

It doesn't seem to have had any updates since 2013. Is anyone out there in-touch with Chuck? Does anyone out there have any insight?

Rick
