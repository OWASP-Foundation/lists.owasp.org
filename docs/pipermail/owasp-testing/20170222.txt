Subject: [Owasp-testing] v5 Plan?
Message-ID: <SN1PR19MB02088958D6D9E159F153F856C2500@SN1PR19MB0208.namprd19.prod.outlook.com>

Good afternoon Testing Guide list, it's been 2 or 3 years since v4 was published.


Is there a plan/timeline for starting to work on v5 yet?

Is it going to be a collaborative wiki edit again or is github (https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Testing-Guide) going to be used?

Hi,

yes we have to create a timeline for that but we need to publish a new
version this year. Who wants to join the team for v5?


We use the OWASP wiki to collaborate to the project.


Thanks,

Mat
