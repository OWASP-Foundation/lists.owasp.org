Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Risk Rating Methodology Absent in OTG v4 (pdf)
Message-ID: <CAKreCbH26srMspSpgf7N3ho8nCUU553XO2pTe5a7N_uAZo9k6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have reviewed the contents of OTG v4 (pdf) and have noticed that OWASP
Risk Rating Methodology is not included as in the previous version (I think
it was in section report or similar).
Does anyone know why that is?

Best regards

Alexander
