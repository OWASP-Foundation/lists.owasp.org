<PRE>You know, I've reviewed a lot of code and I don't generally want to see much
design documentation.  In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention
that I seem to be in the minority on this point -- at least among the code
review experts at Aspect.

But there are two important points to consider here.

1) The documentation is NOT TRUTH.  The truth is in the code.  Everything
else is a model or an abstraction.  Very often the code does not work like
the documentation says it should.   So if you do look at docs, you better
have a very skeptical eye.  Remember, NOBODY DOCUMENTS VULNERABILITIES.

2) You don't always have time to review both the documentation AND the code.
I believe your time is better spent in the code, since that's where the
problems are.  Reviewing the documentation can take weeks that soak time
from the effort.  It's just a question of where your hours are best spent.

If a code reviewer is really skilled at reading code for security, having a
ton of documenation is really not necessary.  If it is, that's a problem
with the code, since if the reviewer can't quickly understand it, neither
can anyone else.  And if you can't understand how an application protects
itself or how the security mechanisms work, they're almost certainly broken.

IMHO the &quot;Use what you have learned&quot; should be a different topic or issue
(as well if you agree with Nish), I think that information in not part of an
specific technique.

I agree the stuff is pretty good. I also agree with jeff's comments and have
a couple of more suggestions, i think we should have another topic which
talks more on the type of documentation that would be useful.
basically DFD and application flow diagram type documents definately help
understand the application code and application flow. what are your thoughts
?

nish.
