<PRE>Sorry just woke up :0)
Looks brilliant imho, Mark do you want me to add Jeff's updates to the 
doc or have you already done it?

</I>&gt;<i> Mark,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> Here are a few more items to beef up the access control section.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ensure that the application allows users to access only those 
</I>&gt;<i> functions and assets they are specifically authorized for.
</I>&gt;<i> Verifiy that users are allowed to access assets and functions as 
</I>&gt;<i> described in the matrix.&#160; Also verify that users cannot access assets 
</I>&gt;<i> and functions outside their authorization. Because this set is 
</I>&gt;<i> generally quite large, choose a set of specific tests to exercise the 
</I>&gt;<i> access control mechanism. For example, the least privileged user 
</I>&gt;<i> should attempt to access resources and functions of more privileged 
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ensure that the access control mechanism is implemented in a 
</I>&gt;<i> centralized fashion, not distributed throughout the application.
</I>&gt;<i> Ensure that the access control mechanism behaves consistently across 
</I>&gt;<i> the entire application. Distributed mechanisms are impossible to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement and configure correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Verify that all accesses to the application are subject to the access 
</I>&gt;<i> control check.
</I>&gt;<i> Attempt to access the application in a variety of ways that are 
</I>&gt;<i> outside the normal user's path. A proxy can be helpful here in 
</I>&gt;<i> generating communications that would not ordinarily be expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Evaluate whether the application relies on any external information to 
</I>&gt;<i> make access control decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> Examine all information that enters the application and manipulate it 
</I>&gt;<i> to attempt to subvert the access control decision. A proxy can be 
</I>&gt;<i> useful here to manipulate these values.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ensure that the application uses only the identity determined by the 
</I>&gt;<i> identification and authentication mechanism to make access control 
</I>&gt;<i> decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> Verify that the application does not use any identifiers or names as a 
</I>&gt;<i> proxy for the authenticated identity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assets and functions shall be clearly associated with the information 
</I>&gt;<i> required to make access control decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> Examine the assets and functions to be accessed by the application. It 
</I>&gt;<i> should be clear what part of the access control matrix they belong to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Verify that both coarse-grained URL based access control and 
</I>&gt;<i> fine-grained access control to specific functions and assets is 
</I>&gt;<i> properly implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> Attempt to access the application in a variety of ways that are 
</I>&gt;<i> outside the normal user's path. A proxy can be helpful here in 
</I>&gt;<i> generating communications that would not ordinarily be expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Verify that users have been assigned the minimum privileges and 
</I>&gt;<i> authorizations necessary to perform their tasks.
</I>&gt;<i> Verify that users do not have privilege to perform functions that they 
</I>&gt;<i> do not need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ensure that administrators have been assigned the minimum privileges 
</I>&gt;<i> and authorizations necessary to perform their tasks.
</I>&gt;<i> Verify that administrative users do not have privilege to perform 
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Verify that only the authorized types or modes of access to assets and 
</I>&gt;<i> functions are granted to users.
</I>&gt;<i> If the application requires specific privileges, such as read, write, 
</I>&gt;<i> execute, etc&#8230;, verify that these privileges are accurately enforced. 
</I>&gt;<i> Be sure that there is no way a user with read access can cause the 
</I>&gt;<i> system to perform a write function.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, sorry for the delay in this. I thought I would get to it last night
</I>&gt;<i> but it took a little longer than I thought and some other things got in
</I>&gt;<i> the way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I have tried to make everything as an &quot;issue&quot; that should be checked 
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> and not a consequence or a technique. I have aligned this with OASIS 
</I>&gt;<i> WAS
</I>&gt;<i> Vuln Types although there are a few issues I would like to still add. I
</I>&gt;<i> have also removed the things that were techniques or consequences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Let me know what you think. I know we will need to add more issues etc
</I>&gt;<i> but I hope the formatting and style is now consistent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you like it I suggest we use this as a template, and send updates 
</I>&gt;<i> via
</I>&gt;<i> email to the list. If you update the doc even with tracking turned on 
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> winds up with having to merge different versions and I end up being
</I>&gt;<i> secretary and I don't look food in a skirt. Drunken pictures of a
</I>&gt;<i> Montreal bachelor party out there will validate that!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we can make changes very quick I would be happy to release it this
</I>&gt;<i> weekend and the Testing Part One next weekend although that depends on
</I>&gt;<i> how much work you all think this still needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please take a look and think of issues that are not covered and send
</I>&gt;<i> them to the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Cheers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
