<PRE>Yes, Friday is fine. It's only 48 pages.
 
If I have specific comments for particular authors to understand what they've written, I would post to the testing list?
 
thanks,
Andrew

	That is so awesome. I would really like to be able to get this out later this week (before end of month) as we have long promised.
	
	The main challenge is that Chapter 4 doesn't fit from a grammatical, length or content perspective.
	
	The aim of this Part 1 is to be the What, Why, When, Where of Tetsing with Part 2 being the How. Ie aprt from the Testing Framework we should just be introducing concepts, techniques and ideas. Part 2 will cover details HOw To's.
	
	Could we get an updated draft by Friday ?

	&gt; Mark,
	&gt; 
	&gt; I have time this week and what you're asking is what I do all day :) Shoot me a draft and I'll get it back to you. I can QA about 20 pages an hour.
	&gt; 
	&gt; thanks,
	&gt; Andrew

	&gt;
	&gt;       We have now written 95% of the text for Part 1 of the OWASP Testing Guide (the last 5% will be done this week). We want to move on to Part 2 but need to finsih this first.
	&gt;      
	&gt;       As is natural with projects with multiple authors, the current draft is in need of some love and attention. Essentially it needs a good technical author to take the draft and make it read well and look nice.
	&gt;      
	&gt;       Anyone with such skills and time to help us this week (sorry it needs to be done this week) ? If so please contact me offline from the list.
	&gt;      
	&gt;       Thanks
	&gt;
