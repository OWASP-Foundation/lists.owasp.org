Does anyone have any sort of documented workflow on the steps you take when performing a web application assessment. I know often it's a combination of tools and manual assessments when performing the audit, but there must be some sort of logical workflow you follow when doing an audit, i.e. 1) do this first .. 20) wrap up testing and write the report.
?
There must be some tests you run before others, and some areas of the app tested before other areas. I just wondered if you have a workflow that you follow when you do your audits if anyone could share the workflow of whats tested first, perhaps a 1-20 type guide, with 1 being the first thing you do when engaging in a new audit, and 20 being the final thing.??
?
If you do have such a workflow, can you share it? Or point me in the direction of a template workflow that you perhaps built your internal audit workflow on...
?

We us the OWASP Testing Guide to develop test cases.  But we also have an audit process that reviews the entire (SDLC) used during development for best practices and evidence that the best practices were followed.

Hi Jon,

There really isn't a set specific procedure as each application is
different.  The owasp testing guide is to give you general guidance on
what should be tested and how it can be tested.  A lot of testers have
their own methodology but at very high level I would recommend doing
the following first,

Understand the application (purpose and functionality).
- Walk the application with a proxy at each user level
(unauthenticated all the way through all access roles).  This is
important to understand things such as session handling, access roles,
redirects, error handling, functionality at each level, etc.
-Spider the app at each level to map it out

Once you have an understanding of the application and the scope of it
then you can proceed to test things such as input validation (manual
and with a scanner), session management, business logic, ssl/tls
ciphers, etc, etc.  Much of these can be tested without any
predetermined order usually but you definitely need to do the first
step mentioned above.  A lot this comes with experience of knowing
what to test first depending on what you see during your walk of the
application.  The first step is critical when it comes to trying this
such as vertical and horizontal privilege escalation, etc.

For tools and technology, you can use OWASP for sure.

For baseline and orientation, I recommend the Mozilla Web App Security documentation.

For process regarding security/assessment in SDLC, please refer to this excelent doc:
http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltndec03.htm


Hope it helps :)

I agree with Kevin on this.

 

In broad strokes I normally explain to process to
co-workers and clients as:

 

1) Recon - Surf the app (both automated and manual) [read
any user docs that may be available]. In order to find all the
pages/functionality to be tested. (Check xssed.com, etc)


2) Identification - Automated VA (AppScan, Burp Active,
Hailstorm, SkipFish, whatever).

3) Vulnerability Analysis - Manually validate the
automated results, see if you can turn them into interesting things (beyond
alert(1), LFI of win.ini, and SQL errors, etc). Browse through some passive assessment proxies (Fiddler, RatProxy, Burp, etc).


4) Penetration Testing/Business Logic Testing - Can you
push any of the identified issues any further? Command injection? Remote
shells (web shells)? Etc Are there business logic flaws? Can fictional Peter see fictional Joe's accounts/docs. Can I buy products for negative values, etc. JSON or XML data leaks, did they send me more than I actually get to see. Hidden functionality (style=display:none, did they hide things from me instead of actually just not including them in a page, etc). Is CSRF possible (Active scanners try to check for this but aren't "really" good at it. Check manually.) etc etc
That's the basic model I use and explain. Obviously it's not totally linear/chrono, I may loop back around through any step(s) as items are identified or new content/functionality is exposed.


 

 Rick
