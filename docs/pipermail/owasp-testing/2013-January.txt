Hello,

I was wondering in what part of the guide do we check for
unrestricted/unvalidated file uploads? Should it be a new issue to test for?

Regards,

Eduardo Castellanos N.

Hi Eduardo, 
? I believe we should test for this (I know we currently do). I would suggest putting it into the business logic section given that it is largely a business decision as to what file types should be accepted for upload.

? Andrew

Hi Andrew, 
We started writing to have a first draft of the guide soon. 
Then we can review the ToC and understand what we can improve. 
Make sense? 

Thanks,

@Andrew,  I'm more inclined towards the data validation section as the main
issue here would be that the file extension or the file's contents is not
properly validated/sanitized.

@Jim Manico, That's awesome, we only need to reformat it and find a place
for it on the guide.

Eduardo Castellanos N.

That makes sense too :) 

Re the vulnerability list from the ASDR; I think a reference to the more comprehensive CWE list ? in the test guide is more appropriate as t he ASDR list is a subset of the CWE ( the ASDR project itself lists CWE as a related project ) .?From here we ?could go down the road of "well if we're referencing CWE, or ASDR, why don't we have test cases for each of the CWE or ASDR ?software weaknesses ?" I'm in favour of referencing?one or the other ?for now and investigating whether its feasible to adopt this approach in the next version given the scope of such an undertaking.

I have done alot of research and come up with teh attached spread sheet and 4 different lists of?Busines Logic issues.

I have not been able to easily combine them.

Should I just write to your list?

Do?I create a separate page for each??

Any ideas/thoughts?

Thanks,
David

Hi David, 
? Looks like a great compilation of business logic weaknesses and attacks. H ow did you derive the list from each of the four sources? i.e. why did you pick those weaknesses from the CWE? 

My comments are: 
1) there is a lot of commonality between the four sources (as well as other areas within the Test Guide TOC, e.g. weak password recovery, see 4.4.11 ). Reconciling these will reduce the length of the list. 
2) some of the sources have different functions. CWE identifies a weakness that we can test for, the Business Logic Attack Vectors mostly identifies how these can be tested, and the Business Flaws mostly highlights the high level risks to the business if the vulnerability exists and is exploited. However, as some of the sources appear to be cross purpose, this isn't consistent . 

My understanding of how you add them to the TOC is to just add them and see if anyone argues :) However, a more active discussion of each section would be good too. 

regards, 
? Andrew

Hello,

I was wondering in what part of the guide do we check for
unrestricted/unvalidated file uploads? Should it be a new issue to test for?

Regards,

Eduardo Castellanos N.

Hi Eduardo,
? I believe we should test for this (I know we currently do). I would
suggest putting it into the business logic section given that it is largely
a business decision as to what file types should be accepted for upload. 

regards,
? Andrew

Hi Andrew, 
We started writing to have a first draft of the guide soon. 
Then we can review the ToC and understand what we can improve. 
Make sense? 

Thanks,

Hi David, 
? Looks like a great compilation of business logic weaknesses and attacks. How did you derive the list from each of the four sources? i.e. why did you pick those weaknesses from the CWE? 
? 
My comments are: 
1) there is a lot of commonality between the four sources (as well as other areas within the Test Guide TOC, e.g. weak password recovery, see 4.4.11). Reconciling these will reduce the length of the list. 
2) some of the sources have different functions. CWE identifies a weakness that we can test for, the Business Logic Attack Vectors mostly identifies how these can be tested, and the Business Flaws mostly highlights the high level risks to the business if the vulnerability exists and is exploited. However, as some of the sources appear to be cross purpose, this isn't consistent. 
 
My understanding of how you add them to the TOC is to just add them and see if anyone argues :) However, a more active discussion of each section would be good too. 
? 
regards, 
? Andrew

Can you please give me some guidence on the Business Logic Section? 


I have done alot of research and come up with teh attached spread sheet and 4 different lists of?Busines Logic issues. 

I have not been able to easily combine them. 

Should I just write to your list? 

Do?I create a separate page for each?? 

Any ideas/thoughts? 

Thanks, 
David

I think the challenge is observing the fact that the phrase: Business Logic is heavily overloaded in all of the three links provided. The traditional "infosec" view defines a lot more things under the business logic banner than say a traditional software view would do.

May I propose that we focus our usage of the term towards concepts of the business domain itself? For example, if you are developing an insurance quoting application, the business logic would be comprised of the rules and calculations required to price a combination of drivers and vehicles. The stuff regarding AuthN, AuthZ, etc would be outside of it.

If you look at calculations for say taxes, we would then test for invariants. This could include looking at how validation is handled, the order in which processes/steps are executed and of course transactional considerations (e.g. ACID).

There has always been a lot of confusion of the purpose of the Business Logic section and including both Eoin's and James' definitons would help?clarify its purpose. 

There?is also the other?question raised by David, which relates to how we write test cases. A test case should simple and testable. The most understandable security test cases are those that test for a specific vulnerability or class of vulnerabilties. The more specific, the less confusion for the tester and the application owner when they receive the report.

? Andrew

This has always been the million dollar question!
Approach suggested; 

Identify parameters which change app state.
Trace positive model.
Identify values which are key to positive path if execution. (Pivot values)
Identify valid value ranges.
Identify order of values which are set or changed for positive model.
Alter pivot values to arbitrary values.
Remove pivot values.
Add additional pivot values.
Etc etc.

It's hard to nail down approach as all apps are unique :)

True enough. This also applies to the Testi ng Guide more broadly. The prescriptive nature of the Guide offers rigour in testing, but if too prescriptive then it will not catch problems that are not easily classified (such as multiple step issues you describe) . Perhaps we should consider a hybrid approach between the current prescriptive model and rec ommending that security testers take a leaf out of the functional tester's book and not be afraid to write their own test cases to meet the requirements of the target application. This offers the efficiencies of pre-canned security test cases but also the flexibility to methodolically test more complex application functionality or workflows of particular concern to the application owner .

I think that ?this? is why I liked this section.
?
Busines Logic is?very much like?functional testing. 
?
We say that Business process testing cannot be automated but functional valid business logic?is?automated by the functionl tester all the time because we validate tha the?application does what it should do.
?
But,?it is true that the Functional Invalid business logic is impossible to completely automate since we do not know all that can go wrong.??
?
But, some?functional Invalid business?logic testing can be tested.
?
For example :
In the existing?guide it says that it is impossible to automate "if a bank's "fund transfer" page allows a user to transfer a negative amount to another user."
I automate testes like this all the time looking for an error message when entered through teh GUI or http failure response when submitting around the?GUI??????
?
I am thinking?that the?examples in the existing section should be able to be put into catagories with more details and?this section may?actually be?the?"core" that uses?or?applies many of the techniques in the rest of the guide.?
?
Would this?section be?where I create catagories then link them to the other parts of the guide, sort of like the "anatomy or an attack"?
?
Thanks,
David?

CWE identifies a weakness that we can test for, the Business Logic Attack Vectors mostly identifies how these can be tested, and the Business Flaws mostly highlights the high level risks to the business if the vulnerability exists and is exploited.

Perhaps the business logic section could become the flexible, write-your-own, test case set. Provide some generic test cases for what to look out for, but then encourage security testers to behave more like functional testers and define their own test cases.

I think that ?this? is why I liked this section. 
? 
Busines Logic is?very much like?functional testing. 
? 
We say that Business process testing cannot be automated but functional valid business logic?is?automated by the functionl tester all the time because we validate tha the?application does what it should do. 
? 
But,?it is true that the Functional Invalid business logic is impossible to completely automate since we do not know all that can go wrong.?? 
? 
But, s ome?functional Invalid business?logic testing can be tested. 
? 
For example : 
In the existing?guide it says that it is impossible to automate "if a bank's "fund transfer" page allows a user to transfer a negative amount to another user." 
I automate testes like this all the time looking for an error message when entered through teh GUI or http failure response when submitting around the?GUI?????? 
? 
I am thinking?that the?examples in the existing section should be able to be put into catagories with more details and?t his section may?actually be?the?"core" that uses?or?applies many of the techniques in the rest of the guide.? 
? 
Would this?section be?where I create catagories then link them to the other parts of the guide, sort of like the "anatomy or an attack"? 
? 
Thanks, 
David?

True enough. This also applies to the Testing Guide more broadly. The prescriptive nature of the Guide offers rigour in testing, but if too prescriptive then it will not catch problems that are not easily classified (such as multiple step issues you describe). Perhaps we should consider a hybrid approach between the current prescriptive model and recommending that security testers take a leaf out of the functional tester's book and not be afraid to write their own test cases to meet the requirements of the target application. This offers the efficiencies of pre-canned security test cases but also the flexibility to methodolically test more complex application functionality or workflows of particular concern to the application owner.

The problem with business logic flaws is that they are often part of a 
complex multi-step workflow that can be difficult to automate.

> There is also the other question raised by David, which relates to how we write test cases. A test case should simple and testable. The most understandable security test cases are those that test for a specific vulnerability or class of vulnerabilties. The more specific, the less confusion for the tester and the application owner when they receive the report.

I agree with Andrew.

I also think sometimes in order to perform a good business logic testing
the tester needs to know the business rules of the application.
Then in this case, depending on complexity of the application, it's useful
to have access to business rules documentation.

Ismael Gon?alves

The challenge of automation is a failure in how testing tools operate. Most tools are wired about the notion of point, shoot, aim and have no understanding of the business process itself. One thing I observed as an employee of The Hartford was how QA folks would recreate the same test case hundreds of times just so it could fit into the testing tool paradigm. For example, hundreds of applications all used say Siteminder that bound to Active Directory. So, authentication is something that should be done once provided it is implemented consistently and reused in multiple places.

Functional test tools unlike web vulnerability scanners are taking a step in aligning with the notion of business process testing. HP and others in the functional test tool world are releasing functionality in order to enable. See: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1174789#.UObjK3ca7aE

One dimension of testing that I think we should noodle is to not be caught up in just testing of code. While OWASP is developer-centric, we shouldn't be developer-only. If we start with the mindset of automation against code vs starting with the mindset of finding weaknesses in how business processes are defined, we aren't doing the ultimate job of protecting the business. One way to find weaknesses in business processes is through threat modeling where we could provide guidance on identifying invariants, processes run out of sequence, etc

The problem with business logic flaws is that they are often part of a complex multi-step workflow that can be difficult to automate.

Well put James. So would you suggest we include some advice to testers as to how they can engineer Business Process test cases based on Threat Modelling?

The challenge of automation is a failure in how testing tools operate. Most tools are wired about the notion of point, shoot, aim and have no understanding of the business process itself. One thing I observed as an employee of The Hartford was how QA folks would recreate the same test case hundreds of times just so it could fit into the testing tool paradigm. For example, hundreds of applications all used say Siteminder that bound to Active Directory. So, authentication is something that should be done once provided it is implemented consistently and reused in multiple places. 

Functional test tools unlike web vulnerability scanners are taking a step in aligning with the notion of business process testing. HP and others in the functional test tool world are releasing functionality in order to enable. See: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1174789#.UObjK3ca7aE

A possible way to test for business logic flaws is to derive abuse cases from business logic use cases, data flow analysis and business transaction analysis. The key is model threats, business logic attacks and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Common application vulnerabilities such as forceful browsing, privilege escalation because of lack of enforcement of role base controls as well business logic design flaws in enforcement of strict business logic rules can be exploited  by business logic attacks. Understanding the business logic of the application is critical to derive a set of test cases for identifying business logic flaws. Ideally abuse of business logic should also be reviewed during design and coding as long as the business rules can be reviewed and tested at these stages of the implementation of the application. From security testing perspective you can also think about deriving a set of test cases after threat modeling an application and use and abuse cases have been identified. I have rationalized these ideas in this prezo I did some time ago: http://www.slideshare.net/marco_morana/issa-louisville-2010morana

I like Marco's approach. I note that many of the concepts we're talking about (permission boundaries and boundary value analysis) are the domain of functional testers. Should we try to draw a line in the sand between us and them for this version of the Testing Guide to avoid duplication or just go for it?

I agree with Marco that misuse and abuse cases should be captured, analyzed and used to get at some aspects of business logic attacks. I would also say that the notation of UML is somewhat weak in describing attacks that are based on either ?order? or ?concurrency? and therefore we may need to go a little deeper in our guidance. 
? 
In thinking about automation, I think I would clarify my response to say that there is value in using it, for example in driving load, etc. The thing I think I would emphasize is that automation doesn?t really have the ability to always provide the idiot light to blink in that it may not detect anything is wrong. 
? 
I think our guidance should align somewhat with the architecture-style chosen by the application. Consider the scenario where you have a dumb front end that calls a service orchestration. From an IT perspective, developers may technically make a ?service? stateless, but from a business process perspective may still have state. What happens if service A runs before service B, etc. Another dimension that is frequently ignored is time. What if I find a way to delay execution of a given service without altering either its request or response. This could be highly useful if I want to front-run a few trades on Wall Street for example. 
? 
Another architecture style may be if the application leverages a business rules engine. Consider the scenario of someone wanting to get cheaper auto insurance and wants to get the Gecko to give them more than 15%. An attacker would for gaps in logic where they may be flawed logic in how drivers are classified: 
? 
?????????????? Noobs: 18 to 25? - Add on 88% 
?????????????? Average 27 to 34 ? Add on 44% 
?????????????? Mature 35 to 55 ? Add on 33% 
?????????????? Old Fars 56 and older ? Add on 77% 
? 
Notice that I skipped the 26 year old. So, finding this type of scenario could be uncovered by doing all permutations of low value to high value and looking for data response outliers vs just response codes. 
? 
In the above, it is important to know that the business logic is actually public. Within insurance, it is known as a rate filing and therefore discoverable by someone who wants to exploit it. I think I am saying that we also need to have definitions that understand who has access to what beyond the typical implementation-level of access control.

? 

A possible way to test for business logic flaws is to derive abuse cases from business logic use cases, data flow analysis and business transaction analysis. The key is model threats, business logic attacks and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Common application vulnerabilities such as forceful browsing, privilege escalation because of lack of enforcement of role base controls as well business logic design flaws in enforcement of strict business logic rules can be exploited ?by business logic attacks. Understanding the business logic of the application is critical to derive a set of test cases for identifying business logic flaws. Ideally abuse of business logic should also be reviewed during design and coding as long as the business rules can be reviewed and tested at these stages of the implementation of the application. From security testing perspective you can also think about deriving a set of test cases after threat modeling an application and use and abuse cases have been identified. I have rationalized these ideas in this prezo I did some time ago: http://www.slideshare.net/marco_morana/issa-louisville-2010morana

The challenge of automation is a failure in how testing tools operate. Most tools are wired about the notion of point, shoot, aim and have no understanding of the business process itself. One thing I observed as an employee of The Hartford was how QA folks would recreate the same test case hundreds of times just so it could fit into the testing tool paradigm. For example, hundreds of applications all used say Siteminder that bound to Active Directory. So, authentication is something that should be done once provided it is implemented consistently and reused in multiple places. 

Functional test tools unlike web vulnerability scanners are taking a step in aligning with the notion of business process testing. HP and others in the functional test tool world are releasing functionality in order to enable. See: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/software.html?compURI=1174789#.UObjK3ca7aE 

One dimension of testing that I think we should noodle is to not be caught up in just testing of code. While OWASP is developer-centric, we shouldn't be developer-only. If we start with the mindset of automation against code vs starting with the mindset of finding weaknesses in how business processes are defined, we aren't doing the ultimate job of protecting the business. One way to find weaknesses in business processes is through threat modeling where we could provide guidance on identifying invariants, processes run out of sequence, etc

The problem with business logic flaws is that they are often part of a complex multi-step workflow that can be difficult to automate. 

- Jim 


> There is also the other question raised by David, which relates to how we write test cases. A test case should simple and testable. The most understandable security test cases are those that test for a specific vulnerability or class of vulnerabilties. The more specific, the less confusion for the tester and the application owner when they receive the report.

I think all the contributors to this thread have been very helpful.

I have to admit that I added some of the suggestions to section 4.7
Business Logic when the request was made to come up with ideas. My
thoughts at the time were to have them as examples, rather than being
numbered tests like in the rest of the testing guide.

Some other sources of ideas, or that might be referenced are:

   The Common Misuse Scoring System (CMSS): Metrics for Software
Feature Misuse Vulnerabilities
   NISTIR 7864
   http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/ir7864/nistir-7864.pdf

   Business Logic Abuse, Ponemon
   http://buzz.silvertailsystems.com/PonemonStudy.html?/study
   http://buzz.silvertailsystems.com/Ponemon_UK.html

We should remember that applications might be used to attack other
users and other systems. Additionally, the trusted insider might be
able to undertake attacks that other users are unable to commit. The
attacks in online gaming sometimes add extra insight into what might
could occur in other areas, e.g.:

   Security Issues in Online Games
   Jianxin Jeff Yan and Hyun-Jin Choi
   http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/jeff.yan/TEL.pdf

   Securing Virtual Worlds Against Real Attack
   Dr. Igor Muttik, McAfee
   https://www.info-point-security.com/open_downloads/2008/McAfee_wp_online_gaming_0808.pdf

My thoughts on 4.7 would be to use the ideas in v3 and this thread to
write up something generic, describe how best to identify suitable
tests, add plenty of interesting references, and have a small number
of single-page *example* business logic flaws, maybe boxed out so they
are not mistaken as the only tests that need to be performed.

Some great material there, David. Give us a shout if you'd like help transposing this information into the Business Logic section of the guide.

I think all the contributors to this thread have been very helpful.

I have to admit that I added some of the suggestions to section 4.7
Business Logic when the request was made to come up with ideas. My
thoughts at the time were to have them as examples, rather than being
numbered tests like in the rest of the testing guide.

Some other sources of ideas, or that might be referenced are:

?? The Common Misuse Scoring System (CMSS): Metrics for Software
Feature Misuse Vulnerabilities
?? NISTIR 7864
?? http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir/ir7864/nistir-7864.pdf

?? Business Logic Abuse, Ponemon
?? http://buzz.silvertailsystems.com/PonemonStudy.html?/study
?? http://buzz.silvertailsystems.com/Ponemon_UK.html

We should remember that applications might be used to attack other
users and other systems. Additionally, the trusted insider might be
able to undertake attacks that other users are unable to commit. The
attacks in online gaming sometimes add extra insight into what might
could occur in other areas, e.g.:

?? Security Issues in Online Games
?? Jianxin Jeff Yan and Hyun-Jin Choi
?? http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/jeff.yan/TEL.pdf

?? Securing Virtual Worlds Against Real Attack
?? Dr. Igor Muttik, McAfee
?? https://www.info-point-security.com/open_downloads/2008/McAfee_wp_online_gaming_0808.pdf

My thoughts on 4.7 would be to use the ideas in v3 and this thread to
write up something generic, describe how best to identify suitable
tests, add plenty of interesting references, and have a small number
of single-page *example* business logic flaws, maybe boxed out so they
are not mistaken as the only tests that need to be performed.

One additional observation is to note that testing business logic isn?t quite the same as testing for say SQL injection. We need to introduce more of a ?logical? test than a physical one. We know the infamous ?1=1? in SQL, but need something more logical in terms of guidance. From a developers perspective, they are usually handed specifications written by business analysts that use ?must? and ?must not? grammar. So, a logical test would also strive to test the inverse. We could start with a few requirements and show how to create inverse tests against them.

Another scenario may be to test for forensic capabilities that can help the ?defenders? For example, if we have a business rules engine that uses the RETE algorithm and someone attempts a business logic attack, our simple OWASP logging guidance is inadequate for a developer to understand the path traversal of business logic on any given day.
