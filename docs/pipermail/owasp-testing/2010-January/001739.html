<PRE>First of all, sorry for the x-posting, but it seemed appropriate.

For those of you that don't know, I work in the financial sector and
developed our organization's WAS testing procedures, documentation, and
probably 80% of our whole WAS program from OWASP materials. Great stuff.

As matter of fact, each of our analysts has a LULU printed copy of the
testing guide on their desks. When we write reports up, we use the
OWASP-XX-XX as our classification mapping. For example:

Finding 1 - rXSS - OWASP-DV-001 - <A HREF="hxxp://www.vulnsite.com?msg=&lt;blah">hxxp://www.vulnsite.com?msg=&lt;blah</A> blah,
you get it&gt; - screenshot1.png

When we write our long form reports, we use the text from the testing guide.
It has really proven great for us and we've been doing this since v2 came
out. In addition, we have previously used the top ten literature as
supplementary in proving higher risk, higher priority items. That has worked
great until now.....

A8 on the RC version of the Top Ten throws a nice shiny wrench into it all.
Reason being, there isn't a corresponding OWASP-xx-xx classification that
matches up to A8. Now I've been writing A8 up for some time, but it never
had a nice-neat home in any of the Testing guide classifications.

Now that I've gotten past all that. I'd like to maybe discuss how, possibly
in the future, the two projects could be somewhat more in sync. I'm not sure
there is a good way to do that today, but it sure makes sense in my mind
that all owaspy stuff have some overlap, and should avoid gaps such as the
A8 vs OWASP-XX-XX situation.

Also I see some gaps here:

That aren't covered in any OWASP documentation, and should be. I'd like to
get everyones' thoughts, and probably flames, on this stuff.
