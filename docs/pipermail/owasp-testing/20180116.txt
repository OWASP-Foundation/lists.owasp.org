I have a push hanging out there against the repo... I think we need to come
up with a plan of attack.

I think the current version is quite good, and a lot of the content is
reusable. Major action items:

Review the categories/control families and see if we are good with them
(survey?).
Review the individual tests and see if they are redundant/relevant
(survey?).
Determine new control families and new tests (git has a start for this,
sort of).
Sign-up for authoring tests.

We also need to plan on people NOT being completely committed. We can use
Git's ticketing for workstream, but somehow need to age things out. The
largest part requiring collaboration will be coming up with this plan. So
who is in charge? How do we feel about creating a couple surveys to get a
sense of what needs attention?
