Dear OWASP Testing Guide followers.
thanks to David who did the last rush, we have closed the Testing Guide
Project's first phase!
Many thanks to all the contributors!

All the articles are closed now.
Now it is time for the reviewers.

You can see the status here:
https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmEhPtZ0cHq3dDc5ZFI0Nm9oSkhzNkNxTzNJbGdPdVE#gid=0

Now the ToC is definitive:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

We deleted many items and 3 chapters:
- Web Services Testing (no completed at all, it's better to have a
separate guide on this)
- Logging (not in scope of the wapt)
- Denial of Service (not in scope of the wapt)

Now we have split the set of active tests in 12 sub-categories for a
total of 91 controls:
Information Gathering
Configuration and Deploy Management Testing
Identity Management Testing
Authentication Testing
Authorization Testing
Session Management Testing
Data Validation Testing
Error Handling
Cryptography
Logging
Business Logic Testing
Client Side Testing

NEXT STEP:
We'll contact all the proposed reviewers asking them to review the
Guide in the next 2 weeks:
> Paolo Perego
> Daniel Cuthbert
> Matthew Churcher
> Lode Vanstechelman
> Sebastien Gioria
> Antonio Fontes

Any others that want to help? Please answer only if you can review the
guide in the next days.

Deadline: end of March 2014

Thanks!
Mat & Andrew

I'd like to help review, but I can't commit to reviewing the entire book in
the next few days.  A chapter or two, yes.

Hi,

I cannot update the excel, but I've sent in the following section (replaced Babu): 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Insecure_Direct_Object_References_%28OWASP-AZ-004%29 (Testing for Insecure Direct Object References (OTG-AUTHZ-005) formerly "Testing for Insecure Direct Object References (OWASP-AZ-004)"

quite sure I did other sections (at least one) as well but doesn't seem uploaded them to wiki.


in addition, available to assist in reviewing.

Irene

someone is missing looking at the tab "Author" (we are updating it):

Between  my edits early last March (wow can't believe it's been so long) and a review session this morning I think the section:
4.8.5 Testing for SQL Injection (OTG-INPVAL-006) formerly "Testing for SQL Injection (OWASP-DV-005)"

Is now in pretty good shape.

I'll try to get through reviewing some other content as the week progresses.

I'd also previously provided review and input on the first four sections of the Info Gathering chapter.

Hello Mateo,

I'd like to help reviewing. Actually I already started. I found that the
content for  (OTG-INFO-011) is the same as (OTG-INFO-002).

I also found that (OTG-CONFIG-011) included CORS, which is already covered
in another separate section. (I'm the author of this one).

I'm also adding some text and examples to tests.

I'll let you know of anything else I find.

Cheers,

Eduardo Castellanos N.

Hi Guys,

I pointed out few such duplicities in my mail from December 16 but got no response. This is original email in the archive:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2013-December/002257.html
Could you please find a minute to read and comment on it? Thank you.
I am not sure what changed since then (chapter names, etc) but can check it again later today.

Hi everyone,

More details on this duplication issues.

Initially only one article was listed marking it as testing/fingerprinting
of web server and applications and hence it was bifurcated to two different
articles to clearly list both app fingerprinting and server fingerprinting.

however web application fingerprinting is now covered here :
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fingerprint_Web_Application_Framework_(OTG-INFO-009)


Hence the most optimum solution would be
1)  Delete :
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Web_Application_(OTG-INFO-011)
2) Keep :
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fingerprint_Web_Server_(OTG-INFO-002)
3) Keep :
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fingerprint_Web_Application_Framework_(OTG-INFO-009)

I hope this helps.

Davide do you agree?

Thanks,
Mat
