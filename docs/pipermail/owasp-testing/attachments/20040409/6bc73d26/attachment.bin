Sorry just woke up :0)

Looks brilliant imho, Mark do you want me to add Jeff's updates to the
doc or have you already done it?

Mark,

 

Here are a few more items to beef up the access control section.

 


<italic><smaller>Ensure that the application allows users to access
only those functions and assets they are specifically authorized for.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Verifiy that users are allowed to access assets and functions
as described in the matrix.  Also verify that users cannot access
assets and functions outside their authorization. Because this set is
generally quite large, choose a set of specific tests to exercise the
access control mechanism. For example, the least privileged user
should attempt to access resources and functions of more privileged
users.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Ensure that the access control mechanism is
implemented in a centralized fashion, not distributed throughout the
application.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Ensure that the access control mechanism behaves consistently
across the entire application. Distributed mechanisms are impossible
to implement and configure correctly.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Verify that all accesses to the application are
subject to the access control check.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Attempt to access the application in a variety of ways that
are outside the normal user's path. A proxy can be helpful here in
generating communications that would not ordinarily be expected.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Evaluate whether the application relies on any
external information to make access control decisions.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Examine all information that enters the application and
manipulate it to attempt to subvert the access control decision. A
proxy can be useful here to manipulate these values.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Ensure that the application uses only the identity
determined by the identification and authentication mechanism to make
access control decisions.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Verify that the application does not use any identifiers or
names as a proxy for the authenticated identity.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Assets and functions shall be clearly associated with
the information required to make access control decisions.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Examine the assets and functions to be accessed by the
application. It should be clear what part of the access control matrix
they belong to.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Verify that both coarse-grained URL based access
control and fine-grained access control to specific functions and
assets is properly implemented.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Attempt to access the application in a variety of ways that
are outside the normal user's path. A proxy can be helpful here in
generating communications that would not ordinarily be expected.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Verify that users have been assigned the minimum
privileges and authorizations necessary to perform their tasks.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Verify that users do not have privilege to perform functions
that they do not need.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Ensure that administrators have been assigned the
minimum privileges and authorizations necessary to perform their tasks.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>Verify that administrative users do not have privilege to
perform unnecessary functions.</smaller>


<italic><smaller>Verify that only the authorized types or modes of
access to assets and functions are granted to users.</smaller></italic>

<smaller>If the application requires specific privileges, such as
read, write, execute, etc…, verify that these privileges are
accurately enforced. Be sure that there is no way a user with read
access can cause the system to perform a write function.</smaller>

Subject: [OWASP-TESTING] Updated Pen Test Check List



OK, sorry for the delay in this. I thought I would get to it last night

but it took a little longer than I thought and some other things got in

the way. 


 I have tried to make everything as an "issue" that should be checked
for

and not a consequence or a technique. I have aligned this with OASIS
WAS

Vuln Types although there are a few issues I would like to still add. I

have also removed the things that were techniques or consequences.


 Let me know what you think. I know we will need to add more issues etc

but I hope the formatting and style is now consistent. 


If you like it I suggest we use this as a template, and send updates
via

email to the list. If you update the doc even with tracking turned on
it

winds up with having to merge different versions and I end up being

secretary and I don't look food in a skirt. Drunken pictures of a

Montreal bachelor party out there will validate that!


If we can make changes very quick I would be happy to release it this

weekend and the Testing Part One next weekend although that depends on

how much work you all think this still needs. 


Please take a look and think of issues that are not covered and send

them to the list. 


 Cheers


Mark
