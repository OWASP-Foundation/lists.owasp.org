Dan,

At a high level we decided to split it into two main sections. Part 1 for the How, What and Why of testing, covering the types of testing, pros and cons of each, when to test etc, threat modeling and so on. I am almost finished with that and we will release it mid to late Jan (just after the T10 for 2004 which is complete and WebGoat 3 which is also complete and in cvs if you wanna play /dist folder). 

The work that came in for section 2 the How to Test for specific issues needs some work so we can work towards this later say May. One of the challenges was that the work that came in was all focused on pen testing and at a pretty high level. I think that was my fault for supplying a small temaplate and no example but it needs work. Give us a few weeks to get Part 1 out and we can all focus on each section. oFlow is in testing which will help a lot.
