Testing Team,

I just wanted to drop you all a note and say how excited I am personally at this project. The more I get to talk to big companies and end users, the more I learn how people are waiting for this baby to land. There are a few large companies in the US that are planning to only aquire security consulting services that follow the methodolgy (as long as they agree with it of course) so there is quite a bit riding on it. 

I will make my comments by Decmember the 9th and encourage everyone lese to do the same. If its anything like the guide that has now had over 600,000 downloads, its will get a lot of attention and be sure to be a classic ;-)
