Everyone

I have left messages for David who seems to have vanished. I am personally quite concerned (he is very reliable) but I have no other way of tracking him down and making sure things are OK. With the portal up and moving to its production hosting over the next two weeks we can now start releasing testing and getting on a regular testing chapters release cycle. 

Is anyone else willing and able to step up tp the plate and lead this project ? If so please mail me off-line.

Thanks
