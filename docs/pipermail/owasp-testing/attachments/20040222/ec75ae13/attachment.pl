Hi Nish

Good catch. Actually it's really down to us. What does the group think ? 

My personal thoughts were that we keep this Part 1 of the testing guide at a relatively high level i.e. describe the types of testing but neccesariliy a methodology for executing each technique. Part of the rationale was that I think what we are going to end up with in the testing framework (last Chapter of Part 1) which is a description of a high level process that can be used to build a testing framework in a development organization. It is likely to recomend using all the techniques at various stages where most appropriate i.e. initial manual inspection of design and documentation artificats through to code review of design implementation and eventually both manual inspection and black box testing of deployment. 

I can see value in describing how to under take a black box / white box test here or in part 2 to be honest. That said if we stick to the manta that part 1 of the guide is the 

What, When, Where, Why  and Part 2 is the How, then I guess a more natural flow for the reader maybe to open Part 2 with that content. 

What do yout think ?
