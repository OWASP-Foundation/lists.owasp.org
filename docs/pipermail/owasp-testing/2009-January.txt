Hi,

just reading it, great thing!

Few comments:

* Since Nessus' license (v3) costs $1200 per year for professional use don't 
know whether it's a good idea to just mention Nessus without referring to it's
restricted usage. (Don't know however whether the nasl scripts for checking
SSL are originating from the GPL feed and thus are free and usable with Nessus 
v2, that needs to be checked)

* Maybe it's also worth to mention other weak ciphers like NULL-MD5, NULL-SHA
(null ciphers) and a so called anonymous cipher which is basically nothing.
(yes, they all happen to be out there!).

* As 25C3 demontrated -- it was known since 2004 -- MD5 algorithm is prone to 
key collisions: http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ . UNder the light of 
this recent research I would include a remark that md5 hashes for whatever means 
cannot be considered as not secure anymore.


Cheers,
	Dirk

Regarding commercial vs. opensource testing tools, I am not sure, if we 
should always conceal commercial tools, because there are some cases when
there are not suitable opensource alternatives (e.g. there is no equivalent
strong opensource alternative to Captcha Killer http://www.captchakiller.com/)

I propose to divide all referred tools to three categories (from the highest 
priority to the lowest for the OWASP organization):

1. OWASP opensource tools (we should refer to OWASP tools always when it is 
possible, e.g. WebScarab, WebGoat, ..)

2. non-OWASP opensource tools (sqlmap, w3af, paros, ratproxy, wapiti, ..)
(because we promote opensource ideas)

3. High-quality commercial software that has limited free version (Nessus, 
Burpsuite, ..)

I think, we should tag tools to these categories.
If it is possible, we should prefer to mention platform-independent tools 
(in java) or if they do not exist, then mention both (Windows+Unix) 
alternatives.

Sorry to be a nit, but did you mean "cannot be considered as secure  
anymore"

I would agree that an unsalted MD5 is not secure due to collisions (as  
I think you meant to say?), and rainbow table brute-force attacks.
However, a salted MD5 is arguable more secure.  A salted MD5 cannot be  
attacked with rainbow tables (yet...).
If the developer has a choice over hash algorithms, SHA-2/256 (or  
greater key length) would be preferable, but if MD5 is the only option  
available it could be salted to reduce risk.
Thoughts?

I agree (mostly), OWASP provides an open source testing guide, but  
that doesn't mean that the tools we recommend have to be open source  
too.  OWASP is widely accepted in the corporate space, where open  
source tools have a mixed reception.  The priority list above seems  
sensible - but why should we exclude commercial tools with no free  
version?  If these are being used in organisations, then surely the  
testing guide should reflect this.

should be represented in the guide. As both Pavol and Stephen  
mentioned, you use the tool that is suitable to the job, the guide  
should give people the chance to make the decision if it's right for  
them.

salted/rainbow tables? We're not talking about Unix or other passwords but SSL 
ciphers.

I was not meaning to conceal them. Just flag them. Especially with
Nessus there's the issue of different scanner versions and different plugins 
with both different licenses which not everybody is aware of.

That's a very good idea!

In the meantime I looked into the licenses of plugins. In a Nessus2 version
(distributed from OpenSuse 10.3 and labeled as "GPL v2 or later, LGPL v2 or 
later") the relevant NASL scripts

ssl_anon_ciphers.nasl
ssl_cert_expiry.nasl
ssl_deprecated.nasl
ssl_supported_ciphers.nasl
ssl_weak_supported_ciphers.nasl

are included. I would think that they should be GPLed too. However I would
rather double check this before publication because all but the second carry the 
line "(C) Tenable Network Security, Inc."

Hi Daniel

This is a all times dilemma. To me, listing a commercial tool in OWASP
site is a kind of endorsement (even if explicitly denied, marketing guys
will use it for its convenience anyway). At the same time why would
OWASP be "hiding" useful tools from the community if its goal is
promoting security.

The healthiest way I can think of is that the guide can have links to
sites that by themselves list commercial tools. So OWASP is not
mentioning an specific commercial vendor on its pages and, at the same
time, is providing the information to the community though a third
party.

What do you think?,
Juan Carlos Calderon

As Juan Carlos has already mentioned, promotion of commercial tools by 
the testing guide can be classified as a kind of endorsement (who can without 
bias decide which commercial tool is better than the other one? :-) 
On the other hand, there are some really great commercial tools worthwhile 
to mention, e.g. I am really excited with BurpSuite Professional with autoscan
functionality (I have nothing with Burpsuite, I am just satisfied customer :-)
I like Juan Carlos idea, that the guide should have links to sites that by
themselves should list commercial tools.

And I would also appreciate existence of some vendor-unbiased, open project 
that would compare various commercial/free penetration tools, scanners, etc.
Because at the present time (when sometimes it is impossible to obtain from 
vendor free/trial version) it is very difficult to compare various penetration 
tools and decide which is better in which category... (btw. do you know which
commercial/opensource scanner is the best one in seeking persistent/dom-based 
XSS? I don't... :-)
And because our original OWASP mission is "to have more secure web 
applications in the world", we should support/promote _ALL_ high-quality tools 
(doesn't matter if they are commercial or opensource).

Yeah I understand the problem with endorsing commercial tools, but I  
think linking to a third party list of tools is maybe going too far.   
How about a simple set of rules:
- If the tool is commercial, then the only thing that the guide can  
state is the name of the tool and a link to the vendor's site.   
Nothing else.
- The above rule can be stated just above the Commercial Tools list  
together with: "These products are in no way endorsed by OWASP and are  
listed here only for the reader's convenience" - or something like that.
- If it's open source, then we can go on to comment on what it's good  
points are and its bad points etc.

I'll be honest, I don't subscribe to the hippy GNU way of thinking,  
Pavol has nailed it on the head,

"And because our original OWASP mission is "to have more secure web
applications in the world", we should support/promote _ALL_ high- 
quality tools
(doesn't matter if they are commercial or opensource)."

If it helps you, as a tester, ensure the application is secure, then  
we should supply the name and website as Stephen mentioned.

Leave the opensource flag waving for Richard, it doesn't have a place  
in the real world imho

<ot>yes, I had some conversations with Harald before regarding other issues 
(http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2005/07/12/#20050712-console-servers)
</ot>

OTOH, I don't believe Suse/Novell did a license violation on purpose. I'll 
double check with them.

Personally, I don't mind it. 
But this (mentioning commercial tools in the testing guide) is more OWASP 
political issue (I would be interested in the opinion of OWASP board :-)

Why not? I really like testing new stuff:-)

But if this "testing tool comparison/benchmark project" should be 
vendor/product unbiased, it should be covered by some unbiased open foundation.
And I am afraid the OWASP organization will not cover this project, because 
OWASP does not endorse commercial products or services (which is case of our
comparison testing tool project, or am I wrong?)

Yes, of course. I would like to mention all high-quality commercial stuff
to all testers if it is possible (personally I use Burpsuite Pro and Maltego).

I just want to know if this activity is OWASP-compliant - can be classified 
as endorsement of commercial products or not (this is purely legal, not 
technical question). See http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page, the second 
top line: "OWASP does not endorse commercial products or services"

We should check this "compliance", because if we fill the testing guide with
a lot of commercial tools/links, and then someone from OWASP board decides 
that it is completely wrong, it can be too late ..:-)

The line between endorsing and just mentioning is rather thin in my opinion.
In order to be as unbiased as possible regarding commercial (or non
open-source for that matter) tools the list should be 100% complete. If even
1 tool is available and not mentioned in the list, that could be explained
as "not worth mentioning according to OWASP". Since managing such a list is
close to impossible in my opinion due to the amount of tools appearing and
disappearing every day, it is very risky to include it.

Personally I think it would be a better idea to create a seperate list
(perhaps even a seperate project) with a good disclaimer and mention a link
to that list in the testing guide as a (limited) source of information. The
main goal of the OWASP testing guide is understanding vulnerabilities and
understanding how to test them, not about automating those tests. Therefor
the independancy of the testing guide should be more important than
providing a complete list with automation tools.

I agree with Pavol.

This is more a political issue, involve the board just to make sure. About benchmarking, Vendors are very reluctant to them , even EULAs contain clauses that prohibit you to benchmark some products.

I remember Tom Brennan just posted a site for people to upload independent evaluation of tool, maybe those posted there could be used in the guide as they are offered to but not done by OWASP.

:) I will cut the discussion from my side as I have spend a lot of your time applying gas to the topic :)

Personally, I don't mind it. 
But this (mentioning commercial tools in the testing guide) is more OWASP political issue (I would be interested in the opinion of OWASP board :-)

Why not? I really like testing new stuff:-)

But if this "testing tool comparison/benchmark project" should be vendor/product unbiased, it should be covered by some unbiased open foundation.
And I am afraid the OWASP organization will not cover this project, because OWASP does not endorse commercial products or services (which is case of our comparison testing tool project, or am I wrong?)

Hi,

Uff, how can a vendor prohibit you to benchmark/compare his product with the
competitive one? I think, this is a basic right of all customers in all 
democratic societies - to benchmark/compare various products and write about 
them.

I think this is very similar to "comparative advertising" which is allowed
in the US also in the EU :

http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:376:0021:0027:EN:PDF

Can you show me at least one EULAs (of security tool) where it is prohibited
to benchmark it?

And what we can do - if some vendors of security tools prohibit us to benchmark
their tools - we will not involve their tools in our benchmark/comparison, 
we will just mention that due to the vendor NDA we can't benchmark them.
And this act can be very negative for their product promotion -> 
personally I would never buy a product that can't be compared with the other 
one..

I agree, as long a deep research of tools is done and all of them are
published that is ok,  while we not only mention those we know at first
hand (Which I think is huge effort) also adding an invitation in the
guide page asking readers to add more tools is a good idea, I guess.

About comparison is not that you cannot compare them, of course you can
do it, for internal purposes. But in our experience and AFAIK. What you
cannot do, is to publish the results of the comparison without
permission of the vendor, that (ironically) is the purpose of the
comparison in our case. 

This is my experience in the past, but, it was before acquisition of
SPIDynamics and Watchfire so maybe the policies have changed by now.
Also this might not be applicable to all the vendors, anyway, if they
cannot be benchmarking a not of "Not possible to benchmark" or similar
might work and maybe self-promote a benchmark for one of those tools.

Juan Carlos Calderon

It sounds absolutely logical for me.

But what about a new vendor-unbiased, open OWASP project that would
compare various commercial and free penetration tools, scanners (all
high-quality stuff we daily use :-)

Because at the present time (when sometimes it is impossible to obtain
from vendor free/trial version) it is very difficult to compare various
penetration tools and decide which is better in which category....

And because almost all available (opensource + commercial) used tools
would be mentioned in this project, this project should be
vendor-unbiased.

We can benchmark these tools against OWASP WebGoat (or create some other
test samples).
And of course - if this "testing tool comparison/benchmark project"
should be vendor/product unbiased, it should be covered by some unbiased
open foundation
(OWASP?) not by a private company.

Juan Carlos also mentioned than vendors are very reluctant to
benchmarking (some EULAs can contain clauses that prohibit you to
benchmark some products).
Personally I don't know any "non-comparable" security tool, but if they
really exist, we simply would not involve these tools in the final
benchmark/comparison (personally I would never buy a product that could
not be compared with the other one :-)

Remember, our original OWASP mission is "to have more secure web
applications in the world", so we can use this "open benchmark project"
to support/promote _ALL_ high-quality tools (and in this case it doesn't
matter if they are commercial or not).
I think that everybody would appreciate this project :-)

What do you think ? Is it compliant with OWASP rules?

At this moment I am doing a small comparison between several vulnerability
scanners in our testenvironment and I can tell you from first hand
experience that at least IBM, HP and Acunetix have no problem providing
licenses for testing purposes or publication of the test results .
In fact when I presented my test plan they were quite eager to participate !
Off course 3 companies cannot speak for an entire industry, but I think that
it is a signal that things have changed ...

Regarding the testing of tools I see some problems. First of all the test
objects; Webgoat could be a start, but how will you test scanners
specialised in e.g. php or oracle ? Creating test environments for all
possible combinations of OS, DB, webserver and application server is
possible off course, but will take huge amounts of time, storage and (if you
make them available to the community) bandwidth....

Furthermore there is the test methodology; if you let the community do the
tests you need some form of quality control to make sure the test is done
properly and the results are unbiased. The last thing you want is creating
an opportunity for influencing the results ....
