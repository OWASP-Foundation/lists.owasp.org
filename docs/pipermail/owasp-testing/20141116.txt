Hi All,

I have been searching for some mechanism to enter the results of testing
based on the checklist and then have that mechanism be able to output a
report in some fashion. I have seen one template for Dradis pro and some
other web based template that appeared to be just a page. I have also seen
an Excel spreadsheet but it was based on v3 of the Guide.

Either my search criteria is bad or there is not much out there.

Can someone point to anything else that is available or what they would
recommend?

Thanks
Garth
