Subject: [Owasp-testing] Updated illustrations for the Testing Guide/Wiki
Message-ID: <EF9A3A1A4E3959439111057191CAF6780207191A@uranus.omegapoint.se>

Hi all,

 

Just got write access to the Wiki, and have a few questions if you don?t
mind.

 

I recently worked on a print edition of OWASP Testing Guide 3.0 for a course
we are preparing, and while I was doing the formatting stuff (this version
is in A5 format instead of the US Letter format that is readably available)
I also went and re-did some of the illustrations using Microsoft Visio
(because some images was just too compressed to be readable after resizing
them).

 

As I am all about giving back to the community I was thinking about just
updating the old illustrations, but before I do that I want to check a few
things: First off, I was planning to use the PNG format instead of the
current JPG format (JPG is just too lousy IMHO) but either the filename will
not be consistent with its format, or I upload them as new files and edit
the referring documents.

 

How about the original .VSD file? Shall I upload it as well?

 

Sorry for the perhaps off-topic question, but I wanted to check with the
community before I make any major changes.

 

Best regards

Michael Boman

That's great! I agree with the change to PNG.

Yes, that would be very useful if somebody in the future wants to update
the drawings as well (your job would probably had been easier if the
original sources had been available this time around).

Hi Michael,
as Anug and Javier said, I think it's a good idea.
Please go ahead.

Thanks!

Hi Mat and List

New web app test tools are developed from time to time.
Is it good to add new tools to the Guide wiki?

Or does it  introduce over redundancy ?

Hello Aung,

The guide is about the methodology and some tools are given as an
example of what can be used but in no means is meant to be all
encompasing.  To have a list of tools that would be useful in app
testing could be a seperate project in itself that would need to be
constantly updated.  Although I believe having a tool listing would be
a nice project to have for all aspects of app testing i dont think
that it should be part of this guide (IMHO).

Hi Kevin

I can't agree with you more.

I'm in no doubt that tools makes our life a lot easier in some situations
when
manual testing is our default arsenal.

As far as I'm concerned, such a tool project rarely interests folks
and they usually underestimate such.

One example is notable certification - CEH, which people have been saying
- a collection of tools and their usage.

Without tools, penetration testing will take a lot longer.
Without methodology, penetration testing won't be complete and perfect.

Should we start - OWASP Web Pentesting Tool Database Projects?

I think we should. There is no such Distro designed for thorough web
testing.
BackTrack lists just a few of web tools. Either does Samurai.
A big challenge is that we can't stick to one platform. Some tools are for
Windows [Can't run with wine].
Some for Linux. We have to use both.

Some may point to me sites like http://www.security-database.com/.
As far as I know, no single site is dedicated to app sec.

Hi Aung,

I think creating an overview of testing tools is a good idea and the idea
actually already has been proposed at the beginning of writing the Testing
Guide v3.
The reasons that it has not been included are the following:

1) OWASP wants to be as unbiased as possible and does not want to give the
impression that the guide (or OWASP itself for that matter) endorses any
tool or vendor
2) creating, and especially maintaining, such a list would require a
tremendous amount of time and work and possibly many updates of the guide.

The idea was also raised to create a separate database and make a reference
to it in the guide, but for some reason (i can't remember, but I'm guessing
time/effort) that never happened.

I think resurrecting the idea for a tooling database is a good idea, but I
am afraid that it will not have a long life ...

Like I said getting and maintaining such a list would require a tremendous
amount of work and I think it might be difficult finding enough people
getting the job done.
However, if you really want to give it a try, I'd say write a project plan
and send it to OWASP (see
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_Start_an_OWASP_Project for procedure).
If the project starts, count me in;  I am willing to spent a few hours a
week.

regards, Dave

Hi Paulo

No hesitation for such a cool project according to the list's feedback.
Let me start it when I become free from some workload.

The project is not tool-centric.

Tool centric for me means

- Hey this is Tool A - this is used for what A.

Tool centric approach is never intelligent.

I make the project like methodology-based or testing-based approach  like
the Test Guide

- Hey here we go for web server testing - use the following tools - Tool A,
Tool B .... Tool Z

We're clear enough that adding long lists of tools to the Testing Guide is
inappropriate.

Useful tools are really really scattered across the web.

Again, this project is not mere list of tools.

This will contain the screenshots/demo movies contributed by community for
the ease of
followers.

Well, there will be a notice/disclaimer like "OWASP does not endorse any
tool .... "
Should I wait for the Committee decision ?

Hi All,

It is really good to have this discussion here. In fact I have recently
started a new OWASP Tools Project, the aim of which is to identify and rate
application security tools. The project is in its initial stage and at the
moment we are in the process of identifying tools in different categories
and defining the rating criteria for identified tools. As Aung said earlier,
new tools are developed from time to time, we'll keep on updating our list
and then test these new tools to rate them according to the set criteria.

Anyone can suggest new tools and we would include these tools in our tools
listing. The project link is given below:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Tools_Project


Regards
Vishal

Matt,

Thanks for the links.
I've known them for ages and added some tools to the Phoenix list.
Still I feel something is missing.

Vishal

Thanks for reminding us.

I've joined the list -
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-tools-project and see you
there.
Let me suggest others to join the list.

Let's see how it can be.

Something is wrong with the Wiki installation, it can't generate thumbnails
(which I really need as I am uploading high-res [11cm wide @ 600 dpi] images
which needs to be scaled for online viewing).

Another issue is that .VSD files [Microsoft Visio] are not allowed to be
uploaded.

Could someone please give the MediaWiki installation some needed TLC (Tender
Loving Care)?

Best regards
Michael Boman

Hi Michael,
as Anug and Javier said, I think it's a good idea.
Please go ahead.

Thanks!

This information on tools is valuable to our community, the challenge is to
do it in a way that we keep our 'vendor independence'
So maybe, If I can suggest, why don't you start by defining a number of
categories, then add some rules on which tool should fit on each category
and only after that is set, you start the mapping process (including adding
new tools).

I am basically talking about a 'selection criteria' for these tools (which
if we get it right would be very useful)

One word on scalability, I would really recommend that you build this on top
of the new 'WIKI-Database-driven-template' solution we came up at the GPC
(since that will allow you to be able to create a maintainable 'master list'
(with content reused where required)

For this reason I think we should distinguish between opensource and commercial
tools (maybe prefer opensource tools).

I would rate tools licenses in the following order:

1.	
	Open source
2.	
	Free to use (for everyone)
3.	
	Free to use (non-commercial only)

	Commercial

I would be stop the listing inclusion after the 2nd point. IMHO it is not in the projects best intrerest to talk about tools that is not available to everyone - your organisation type or your financial status is a fairly large limiting factor.
 
Just my $.02...

For this reason I think we should distinguish between opensource and commercial
tools (maybe prefer opensource tools).

The criteria to be listed are already discussed and will be presented on the
project wiki soon.

We have chosen to include both commercial and open source tools to be as
unbiased as possible.

Therefor we will include all the listed below license types.

Hello Guys

Here are a few challenges and proposed solutions as I though on this in
the past for OWASP.

All the time I see a tool list my first question is "which of this ones
(regardless of license) is best?", I am a lazy person and wonder this so
I don't have to spend lots of time with the ones in very early stages or
with very limited scope. And that question is the one OWASP cannot
answer without falling in "preferring" (no mater how big, colorful and
blinking the disclaimer is) an specific tool. To solve this problem I
recommend you not only list the tool, but link to sites with reviews to
that tool. 

Notice that regardless of how useful is one over another we should
always list them alphabetically or any other "democratic" way without
taking in consideration those reviews. People will tend to add their
old, clunky or to-be tool in the list as an intend to catch attention
and there is nothing you can do to remove them. But at least having
reviews from other independent sources will put them apart since it is
fairly hard they have any.

The idea is to not allow the list to be too big and clutter with useless
or partially working tools or it will be easily dismissed.

Mentioning the license is fine but do not use that as a category, use
the tool type instead (port scanner, sniffer, App Firewall, etc). I mean
putting that information in a table as the license type that is fine but
do not put it as a header before the actual list or you will tend to
have "Commercial" before "Open Source". But if the tools are listed
alphabetically and the license is mentioned in a column then maybe you
have a good mixture to avoid any appearance of biasing the list (I know
is not the objective).

Having a table is also a good idea as it allows you to show much more
information like the technologies and platforms supported, the version
and release level (Alpha, Beta, RC, production) and much more.

One final one, specialize the list, this is, make sure you focus
exclusively in tools for web applications as there are hundreds of tools
for network security and you will end up being another security tools
list on the net.

Good luck, I hope it helps,
Juan C Calderon

Hi Juan,

Thanks for your suggestions on OWASP Tools Project. This feedback is very
useful to us as an assurance that we are working in the right direction and
to pin point any issues that we might have missed. The points mentioned in
the mail below are very valid points and infact we have already discussed
some of these points on the project's mailing list. Please see my comments
in the mail below.

Regards
Vishal

Actually I myself had the problem of finding a best tool for a particular
job and that was my main reason to start this project. Therefore we just
wouldn't be listing the tools in different categories, but we'll also be
defining a rating criteria to rate these tools. We are still working on
defining the rating criteria and the different possible ways to rate these
tools:
 - We may rate the tools ourselves.
 - We may seek other users' feedback based on their experiences
 - and we may also seek other independent reviews, as suggested by you here.

As we'll be listing both commercial and open source tools, we want to keep
this as unbiased as we can, and thus would only be listing the tools in
alphabetical order. We'll be listing the tools in different categories as
mentioned by you below and any information related to the tools would
potentially be listed in a tabular form. So the intended structure would be
to have the category as a heading (such as scanners, sniffers, proxy, WAF
etc.), then listing all the tools in that category in an alphabetical order
along with all the properties of a tool in a tabular form.

We have decided to include only the release quality webapp related tools in
the list. We are also going to take great care that only properly working
tools are listed here.

All this has already been discussed on the project mailing list and would
soon appear on Wiki as well.

Yes, you're right, and surely we'll only be discussing about tools that are
related to web application security and nothing else.

Great thread and comments

Technically speaking how are you going to store the tool's metadata?

We really need this to be on a 'consumable format' so that we can  
create multiple WIKI views.

I recomend that you use the new 'Template driven WIKI' solution we  
came up at the GPC to manage Owasp projects :)

You should also check Wikipedia for examples on how to present this  
type of information

When Mark and I first started the testing guide project, we did talk about
the tool aspect heavily.
OWASP needs to be unbiased but at the same time we are in a position to
offer guidance on what tool does the job correctly. A OWASP Tools DB would
be a great way, but again we'd need to be pretty strict in the way
information is added by everyone. Vendors can be sneaky :0)

I'd love to offer my help with this, so count me in if you need me..

Hi Dinis and Daniel,

Thanks a lot for your comments on this project.

Dinis, we are already thinking of creating multiple views, and using
templates is a very good idea, but I am not sure if anything like this
already exist on the OWASP website. If you could point us in the right
direction, that would really be helpful.

Daniel, yours is a very valid point as well, but at the moment, I'm not sure
if we can restrict editing of Wiki pages to certain people or atleast
moderate the content added by other people in order to maintain the
integrity of this information. This becomes even more important as we are
not just creating a DB of tools, but are also going to provide rating to
these tools for their efficiency and performance.

Thanks
Vishal
