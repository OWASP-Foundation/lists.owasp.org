Has anyone heard anything about this?

I was just poking around the OWASP site again and still don't see any hint of v4 being started, though one roadmap does list Jan 2011 as the release data for v4 (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Testing_Project/Releases/Testing_Guide_V_4.0/Roadmap). No mention of it on the reboot project list either :(

I do recall at one point v4 was dependant upon Common Numbering being hammered out, https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering, however the common numbering initiative has also stalled in the light of workloads (mine included) and other feedback. Common numbering or requirements has had a good deal of valid feedback:  CW's: https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-common-numbering/attachments/20110707/5c2ba213/attachment-0001.pdf and SMC's: http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2010-January/000583.html. Unfortunately it seems that common numbering/requirements will be delayed for months.

This is just my personal opinion but I don't think drafting TG v4 content be held up waiting for another project. I'm as guilty as anyone else for not being able to deal with common-numbering being moved forward. I think TGv4 could be aligned with common numbering/requirements later (before it goes Gold), or common numbering could be adopted for v5. As things stand v4 is almost 3 years old and lots of items which are currently relevant to developers and security analysts have been identified as missing from v3 (new for v4).

Has there been any movement on this? I still don't see a v4 draft section on owasp.org anywhere.

Matteo, can you open/start the OWASP testing guide v4 wiki draft for a collaborative edit?

Hi Rick,
yes I think you are right. We can not wait for Common Numbering initiative.

Yes, my fault I've to anser to Eoin for the reboot, the project was in
the list. Now I send an email to Eoin and give a feedback soon.

Thanks,
Mat

Message-ID: <CAORxfg5UgDve7UqYT5w+=jGPvGzc_AafxN6uY0wxYKPm18Sm9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

As those of you also on the Leaders list will have seen I've started a Web
Application Security Testing Cheat
Sheet<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Security_Testing_Cheat_Sheet>
.

To quote from that page:
Introduction

This cheat sheet provides a checklist of tasks to be performed when
performing a blackbox security test of a web application.
 Purpose

This checklist is intended to be used as an aide memoire for experienced
pentesters and should be used in conjunction with the OWASP Testing
Guide<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project>.
It will be updated as the Testing Guide
v4<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Application_Testing_guide_v4>is
progressed.

The intention is that this guide will be available as an XML document, with
scripts that convert it into formats such as pdf, Media Wiki markup, HTML
etc.

This will allow it to be consumed within security tools as well as being
available in a format suitable for printing.

It is currently at a very early stage, but any feedback or offers of help
will be appreciated.


As a lot of it comes from the Testing Guide v3, all of the guide authors
are credited (as a group rather than individually).

My initial draft has already been improved by various people (thanks!), but
I'm sure theres plenty more improvements possible.

So please have a look at it, post any feedback to this thread, and feel
free to add more content to the wiki!
Cheers,

Simon
