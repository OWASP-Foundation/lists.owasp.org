<PRE>Hi Mark

Surely there is benefit to be obtained for us all if we can find a
workable model for assessing the amount of effort required for these
types of engagements.  It is a problem faced not only by the providers
of the services, but also by the customers. In practical terms this is
not going to be easy&#8230; so I feel it is encouraging to see the
suggestions that have been made so far.

I would argue that a pricing model IS quite a separate matter.  It is
subjective and will end up undergoing negotiation when it comes to
concluding the sale anyway.  Of course any customer would want to get
the job done at the cheapest possible price. It is not just up to the
provider of the service to establish the market price. Supply and
demand form a healthy part of any commercial activity. So it would
also be for the benefit of the customer to understand the amount of
effort that they should be expecting to receive for their money. 
Armed with this knowledge, they would then surely be better equipped
to weed out the &quot;joe blogs&quot; who intends to do &quot;the minimum possible to
complete a checklist&quot; and be capable of identifying the service
providers that are going to provide a service appropriate to their
requirements.

So I would say let's keep the suggestions flowing!

Regards,
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> This is going to lead to an industry where joe blogs does the minimum
