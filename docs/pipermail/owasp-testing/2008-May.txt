Folks

 

I updated the list
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents
with an update of the testing methodology. 

This is a brainstorming idea to be vetted by Matteo and the guide
contributors.

 

The idea is to cover more in details:

1)       security test requirements: the elicitation of functional and non
functional requirements for testing with use and misuse cases

2)       security test levels: unit tests, integrated system tests , user
acceptance tests

3)       security tests workflows : planning, execution, validation and
reporting

 

Please let me know if you need me to elaborate further. I will be happy to
take ownership of these updates.

 

Regards

That's great.
I think that suject should be very interesting for the new guide.

Thanks,

Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Testing Guide V3 - Index Brainstorming -
	"Spidering and Googling"
Message-ID: <000701c8b0d3$d91a59f0$0200a8c0@wrath>

Matteo,

To follow on from my recent presentation at the OWASP Conference in
Australia, can I recommend that the "Spidering and Googling" section of the
OWASP Testing Guide V2 be split into two sections i.e. "Spiders, Robots and
Crawlers" (before) and "Search Engine Discovery/Reconnaissance" (after) for
the OWASP Testing Guide V3?

The reason for this is two fold:
1. "Spiders, Robots and Crawlers" is a separate process (e.g. recursively
indexing directories outside of robots.txt) and "Googlebot" is dependant on
this technology, hence it would provide a better flow into the "Search
Engine Discovery/Reconnaissance" section, which is why I listed it as
"(before)" "Search Engine Discovery/Reconnaissance" in the above paragraph.
2. The renaming of "Googling" to "Search Engine Discovery/Reconnaissance"
would allow for the inclusion of other search engines, such as Live, Yahoo!,
etc.  Obviously there would be sub-sections under this addressing the
nuances of each search engine.

Please let me know your thoughts or suggestions?

Hello all

I've been watching the list for about 6 months now

Just wanted to introduce myself

My Background
I am Computer Science graduate since 2000 and been doing software testing
since 2004.  I'm currently in a QA lead role in a startup, www.overlay.tv.
I recently completed certification from cstb.ca.  I've done upgrade and
migration testing as well as web application testing


I'm noticing that the heading for the new v3 guide contain a wide range of
testing activities and areas.  I would like to propose adding the following
section

Software System Upgrade and Migration

Looking forward to your thoughts

Basim

Hi Christian,
I think it's a good idea. Would you like to take on this effort?

More than 20 people contact me to be part of the team of the new guide.
We have to discuss about the index and then starting writing.
If you have new idea to share please send us a mail!

Thanks,

Hi Basim,
you are welcome!

How do you think we can add "Software System Upgrade and Migration" to
the Index?
I mean, can you clarify which are the new concepts of testing behind that?

Thanks,

I think this would be a good idea.  There are books written on how to
do Google Hacking so having its own section would be ideal.
Additionally I would like to see the business logic testing section
more detailed.  Such as requiring at least two different accounts at
each privilege level so that you can test horizontal escalation and
not just vertical and give examples of how this can be done (i.e.
changing parameter id=8001 to id=8000 within a POST request).

Matteo,

I would also like to propose that Web Server Content and Web Server
Configuration issues get their own section.  It is touched on briefly
in section "4.2 Information Gathering" of the guide but I think there
are a good amount more things that should be tested on the web server.
 I think there are enough things to test for to have its own section
instead of being lumped in with Information Gathering.

If anyone else has any ideas please let me know.

Hello Matteo and all,

When you say new concept, I'm assuming a new concept for the guide. As to
where it fits as part of the index, I can't clearly see it at this time.  To
be clearer on the term Software System upgrades and migrations, please see
my definition below.

Software System Upgrade:
Basically, is testing the end result of the the data and application when a
patch/upgrade/hotfix has been applied to it (Upgrade path Testing)

Typically, testing this process is as follows
1. installation verification
Did the installation of the patches/upgrade executable/script to the
existing system cause an failures. In the context of a web application is
there exceptions/failures in the application log

2. Database verification (if required, but typically required in majority of
web applications)
This is a two step process where a tester would look to see (either the
output of the upgrade script or database logs) if any error occurred in the
logs
Second, a capture of a subset of a data from before and after would be done
to analyze transformations of data

3. Does the application behave the same way it did before (Functional
testing)

As for migrations, this is defined by completely moving over the another
system.
Examples of migrations:
application A uses MySQL Database -> Apply migration -> application A now
uses PostGres database
application B uses PHP -> Apply migration -> application B now uses Java

The reason I mention the above examples is because I have been exposed to
this scenario where it was expected that the application continues to behave
to same after the transformation


Thats the background of upgrade and migration testings

I guess the next question is how does the above apply to security testing

I've seen changes to table schemas where by the code is not reflective of
the change in the database and as a result "private" or sensitive data has
been exposed.

Not sure where this falls under the current index.  This topic is not
commonly thought of in both the development and testing teams.

Looking for feedback from anyone

Cheers

Basim

Hi all,

actually, I have another proposal regarding Web Server / Application configuration.

I'm internal auditor and normally we focus on different groups for responsibility on solving the issues we found.

>From my point of view, OWASP testing is related with "what any user can do", that is, interaction with the application. Sometimes the problem isn't the application itself, but the configuration of the servers (as an example: server headers or 404 Errors), so programmers can't solve the issues, but the system administrators can.

If you want to review the configuration files, you have to ask for them, that is not "what any user can do", you need access to the files, that is an infrastructure (web platform) issue.

So, my proposal is to add (and maybe change some of the test) some tests focusing on configuration issues, not application issues, due to the person responsible for solve them are (and they should, from the point of view of segragation of duties) in different department.

My two cents

Regards,
Ra?l

Hi all,
here a new draft of the index, with the new articles:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents

At this time we have 20 authors and 5 reviewers.
What do you think about that?

Thanks,

To Me this sounds more like Secure SDLC Testing and not pen testing, not
that the guide is strictly pen testing.

Secure SDLC testing, test plans relating to functional requirements
etc could be a project on its own? Maintenance lifecycle, regression and
root cause analysis relating to the software development lifecycle can (and
should) involve an element of security. This area is very large and needs to
be comprehensively discussed and is a valid candidate for its own guide?

I would be concerned that the guide may be stretching itself and covering
too many things rather than covering fewer things in a more complete manner.

I'm with you on this Eoin, the Testing guide has always been how to  
break it like attackers do, but with a more methodical approach :)

Hello Matteo,

the number of reviewers and authors sound good to me.  I like the TOC
for v3 but have the following additions to propose:

4.2.2 Application Discovery (add the following subsections)
-identify data entry points that accept user input into the application.
-Try to identify server and client technologies such as application
platforms, server operation system, scripting languages,  applets,
forms, cookies, encoding, etc

4.4 Authentication Testing (add the following subsections)
test for username enumeration
test for weak passwords in use

4.5 Session Management Testing (add the following subsections)
test for fixed session tokens (ie new session token not issued upon
athentication, etc)
test for secure cookie attributes (ie secure flag and http only set
and correct path attribute set) -- this touched on briefly in this
section in grey box testing but maybe we should break this out into
its own subsection of Session management testing?


Web Server Testing section (proposed this in a previous email but no
final word from the group?)
test for default content
test HTTP methods (options, delete, put, or webdav enabled)
vulnerable web server software
etc

I agree that this is more on the SDLC side then the actual security
testing of an application.  Secure SDLC testing would be a nice
project to start for OWASP but I think it would be too much to
incorporate into this project.

All,

I think that setting the scope and boundaries is one of the hardest things
concerning creating an application security testing manual. In the case
described above/below it handles the boundary between testing and SDLC, but
the same problem arises when defining the boundary between for example
application testing and ('classic') penetration testing. Clearly the goal of
OWASP is not testing things like the existence of open SSH sockets, but
things like command injection can be used to gain root access on a
webserver; where does application testing stop in that case ?

On the other hand is limiting the scope to far not good either. In my
opinion the testing manual should at least give some information about risks
and things to improve when a 'boundary' is crossed.

regards, Dave

Hey Dave,

I agree with you that there may be some grey areas in defining scope.
However, at some point in the attack, the web application or service is part
of the equation,  I think that is one of the qualifications for the testing
guide.  I do think that if you root a machine and mess with the
configuration for an app, OWASP should be covering the vulnerability in the
configuration change.  So we can basically define the boundaries.  However -
if we are creating a comprehensive guide, do we need to include references
to ways to root the server (not necessarily the details)?  I think it might
be useful, but at the same time the scope may be to wide (how many ways can
you take over a machine?).  From that, I would say OWASP limit the scope to
a web app or service configuration, development, lifetime and retirement.
Everything else is so wide, that we could not put into a useable format
(though like I said, a full attack life cycle reference might be helpful).

Regards,

Mark

I agree with your points Dave, there should be mention of this topic
(upgrade and migration testing) when the scope of the manual has been
reached.  Something along lines of "Although this topic is not in the scope
of the manual, we feel that it should be mentioned so it is not an oversight
when doing testing"

Thanks again for all of your feedback

Looking forward to helping out with the new guide

Basim,

I agree. In the mentioned case of upgrade en migration testing we could add
a note that at least patch management, authentication & access control and
configuration files should get extra attention to limit possible
vulnerabilities.

Hi Kevin,

I think that your points are certainly things to take up in the testing
manual. The only thing I disagree with is 4.4: test for weak passwords.

The way I see it we have Web Application Security Testing (WAST) and
Penetration Testing (PenTest). WAST is about bypassing security, whereas
PenTest is about breaching security. Breaching security can be achieved by
bypassing security (so WAST is a part of PenTest), but there are also other
ways to accomplish that. Personally I think weak passwords fall in that last
category.

Since we already had a discussion about where to draw the line in the scope
of WAST, testing for weak passwords is (IMHO) outside the scope of WAST
(although a note can be added to the autorization section about having
appropriate password policies).

Hi all,

in the OWASP Backend Security Project we included a section about
postgresql testing so if you want you can integrate into testing guide
v3.

Dave,

Thank you for your feedback.  In regards to the weak passwords testing
I agree that a note should be made reference to and it can just be
appended to the Brute forcing section from the v2 guide "4.4.2 Brute
Force Testing".

Carlo,

I think the postgresql would be a nice addition since it is a pretty
popular DB and there is a section for the other major DBs (oracle,
sql, mssql).

Thanks,

Kevin

I sense scope creep here :)

Patch management in an application security testing guide?
Matteo, care to comment?

Also upgrade and migration testing, What are we actually going to test for
here? If there is an application upgrade one does not simply test the
upgraded piece but need to do regression/social testing on the other parts
of the application, in the context of application security the tests are the
same what is tested is different which is subjective and different per
application.

Migration testing would cover the same suite of tests as a regular
application security test, but there may be some security review if the task
was more than blackbox. SO we would look at config files etc. but testing
specific to migration as opposed to testing to see if something is secure,
the difference is minimal.

Not at all actually. The discussion is where application security stops and
what to do with known vulnerability risks beyond it. I think most of us
agree that these things do not belong in a application security
manual/framework, but I think it's also not a good idea to just completely
ignore them.
Like I said, the least we can do is make a (small) note (with reference)
when vulnerabilities are identified which are beyond the scope
of application security.
Ignorance should be avoided at all times.

I agree. As a functional tester I have had these situations before and the
sensible way to scope your testplan is to do a risk analysis and decide
whether a regression test is enough or a complete functional test is
necessary. The same goes for security testing in my opinion.

Problem is going off scope as to what the Testing guide covers. I  
agree with you that we need to ensure that all risks have to be  
covered, the Testing guide was always a method of looking at an  
applications security from a Black/White hat perspective. There are a  
load of guides out there that explain how to look at the  
infrastructure side of testing, and whilst we can reference them,  
sticking to the application layer is more advisable, knowing how hard  
this guide is to manage and control.

It's an interesting area though

Thank you all for the discussion,

I wanted to bring an attention to this topic as it typically it is an after
thought in most organizations. Like I mentioned earlier, with my experience,
I've seen functional testing passing on a fresh install but once an app was
taken from the previous deployed state to the new state it would completely
fail.  In addition, code changes made to newer versions that checks a state
expects to be one format and the data is another format and as a result it
displays sensitive information. It can be as small as a typo

I guess the above examples demonstrates more poor programming techniques but
as quality assurance testers/professionals it our job to cover all of the
angles.

I Look forward to participating with you all in this guide.

As Dan and I have said, as past leaders of the guide, the guide is focused
on Black box, Grey box pen testing. It was never intended to cover testing
during the SDLC. Branching out too much shall dilute and weaken the core aim
of the book. Secure SDLC is an entirely different subject.

A great idea would be to document SDLC testing phases, where they should be
done, how to do them, requirements definition of a testing plan, integration
of security testing into functional testing during the SDLC and the
assignment and remediation of issues/bugs found during this task. This would
be a great addition to the Development Guide, Testing Guide, Code Review
Guide.....a "Secure SDLC Leading Practice Methodology" Book but IMHO adding
this to the Testing guide is inappropriate.

Matteo,

I refer to the Cache of Google prior to direct communication with the Web
Server to note any changes since the last indexing by "Googlebot".

Can I suggest that "4.2.3 Spiders, Robots and Crawlers" and "4.2.4 Search
Engine Discovery/Reconnaissance" are before "4.2.1 Testing Web Application
Fingerprint" and "4.2.2 Application Discovery"?

Hi all,
here a new draft of the index, with the new articles:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents

At this time we have 20 authors and 5 reviewers.
What do you think about that?

Thanks,

Hi Kevin,
sorry for the delay. Good points!

> 4.2.2 Application Discovery (add the following subsections)
> -identify data entry points that accept user input into the application.
Yes that is missing: we can add "Identify entry points"

> -Try to identify server and client technologies such as application
> platforms, server operation system, scripting languages,  applets,
> forms, cookies, encoding, etc
yes, we have to improve the following:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Web_Application_Fingerprint
We can create a new section: "Testing for technologies" and shift the
first one in the second.

> 4.4 Authentication Testing (add the following subsections)
> test for username enumeration
I agree, Marco just said that.
> test for weak passwords in use
We just have: "Testing for guessable user account" that should be improved.

> 4.5 Session Management Testing (add the following subsections)

Great. What if we add: "Testing for cookies attributes"? We can check
"HTTP Only", "Secure" and time validity attribute of the session
cookies.

Yep we still have that here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_HTTP_Methods_and_XST

Thanks!

Hi Christian,
yes that make sense for me.
I'm creating a new index following all our suggestions.

Hi all,
here is the updated index table:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Project_v3_Roadmap

What do you think about that?
There are a lot of new articles to write or to improve, so tell me if
you are interested writing a particular section.
We will write from the 1st June to the 30th June.
Daniel, Eoin, what is your opinion?

Thanks,
Mat

Matteo

Good work on putting together the list. I confirm my pledge to write my
sections on the testing techniques starting in June. 

One thing to mention just looking at the index.. I am preparing a
presentation on CSRF for my local chapter and it came across that the
testing CSRF page for vs. 2 of the guide of the page does not have a
reference to CSRFTester.

Do you/the list think is a good idea to update the CSRF testing section of
the guide? If yes I can contribute to this updates.

Ciao

Marco M.

Hi all,
here is the updated index table:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Project_v3_Roadmap

What do you think about that?
There are a lot of new articles to write or to improve, so tell me if
you are interested writing a particular section.
We will write from the 1st June to the 30th June.
Daniel, Eoin, what is your opinion?

Thanks,
Mat

Hi Marco,
sure you are right. If you want, you can obviously edit it.

Thanks,
Mat

30 days is tight, will we be looking at that for the first drafts  
initially?

As for my bit, i'd like to be one of the reviewers, I can make sure  
the prose/grammar and structure is kept in-line, so we have some  
structure with regards to the guide.

Yes is tight, but we have to run :)
We have to setup only one month because maybe we have to add some
others articles after that.
After the writing phase it is really important to begin the reviewing
phase because this time it is very important to produce an high
quality guide. So the reviewers are asked to review everything to have
a professional output.

That makes sense?
Mat

Hi,

I think we should add "Testing for SQL Wildcard Attacks" under the "Denial
of Service Testing" section. This is a new issue, I released the paper about
a week ago.
Details of this problem can be found here :
http://www.portcullis.co.uk/uplds/wildcard_attacks.pdf

If you are happy with that I can write it.

Thanks,

Hi all,
does it fit for you the following template for each paragraph?
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Template_Paragraph_Testing_v3

That is the old Template for the OWASP Testing Guide v2, I think it
should work also for this new version.

Hello Everyone

I'm a recent entrant to this list, albeit late but I am very happy to be a part of this project. Thank you Mat.

Further, I've given the v3 proposed Table of Contents a quick look and i feel that it would be better if we add a section on Encoded injections in the Data Validation Section. Encodings like URL encoding, hex, etc - The kind of encoding that is usually used to obfuscate the injections in order to bypass generic/basic filtering mechanisms.

I feel this would be a good addition. List, provide your thoughts on this and advise if this is feasible.

Regards
Harish

Matt,

The format looks good to me.  One suggestion is change the "Tools"
subsection to "Type of Tools" so that we are not seen as promoting any
certain tools such as commericial type tools or open source tools
which may have been backdoored.  For example we could say "Web proxy
or browser plugin", unless OWASP has a tool for it in which it could
go like this, "Web proxy such as Webscarab or a browser plug-in".
Just want to make sure we are still seen as unbiased and not seen as
promoting any commercial vendor.

Hello Matt,

I am interested in writing the sections:

(new) 4.2.3 Identify application entry points
(new) 4.7.3 Testing for Cookies attributes
4.5.3 Testing for Guessable (Dictionary) User Account
(toimp)4.4 Business Logic Testing

I also think that we should have a section after 4.6.3 for horizontal
privilege attacks.
4.6.3 Testing for Privilege Escalation
-This section covers gaining access to priviliges above what was
allocated to you but not making transactions as another user with the
same privilege level.  Or you could cover all of the above and just
make note with parenthesis next to 4.6.3 with (horizontal and
veritical escalation).


Thanks
Kevin

Hi Kevin,
that's great!
I've updated the index:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents

I think that "4.6.3 Testing for Privilege Escalation" is sufficient to
describe horizontal and vertical escalations, otherwise we will create
too much articles :) Are you agree?

Hi Kevin,
sure we would not like to promote any commercial tools.
Do you mean to create 2 separate tool indexes? One for commercial and
one for open source? We usually suggest only open source tools.
Look for example at the following:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection

Personally I think if we want to be absolutely unbiased we should mention
commercial tools. Off course we do not have to go in to details what every
tool is capable of, but if, for example, a chapter deals with automated
vulnerability scanners, products of HP, IBM, Acunetix and others should at
least be mentioned to exist.

but, off course, that is just my opinion :)

Agreed but these are shark infested waters :)

I never had any issues referencing them in previous versions, as long  
as we offer the pro's and con's of both

Mat,

I will try to write something for chapter 2.4, 2.4.1 and 2.4.3, although I
might need some input in topics and subjects which need to be included ...
(call it stage fever ...)

Yeah definitely, very controversial
 
Why not?
Vendors use to use whatever they see to do marketing on their product,
so you should be 100%, 200% or 1000% sure to make clear OWASP is not
endorsing in any way their product.
 
Why yes?
to be unbiased, I think as well you should mention them, as there are
people willing to know what else is there beyond the open source
horizon.
 
Note: you can always use a hard to read color and small font for
commercial ones :P (just kidding)

Juan Carlos Calderon

property in common; the speed at which they can generate false positives...
that is worth mentioning I recon

Thanks for the feedback.  I originally was just saying to not have any
mention of commercial tools so that users of the guide would not
potentially see OWASP as promoting a commerical tool and the potential
of being biased (such as naming HP's webinspect but not Appscan for
example).  If the group thinks we should include commerical tools then
we should also list the commerical tools seperately from open source
ones in the subsection.  Also I think a quick disclaimer in the
beginning or appendix noting that OWASP does not endorse any
commercial tools only that we make mention of tools that could aide in
the testing of an application.  As for giving the pros and cons of
certain tools I think that would be beyond the scope of the guide
unless you were referring to for example using the cookie analyer
within webscarab for speed or use the cookie cruncher from HP for
pretty graphs to be used for inserting into reports (management likes
pretty pics ;-).  But listing the pros and cons of each tool would be
pretty lengthly and beyond scope.  Just my 2 cents.

Careful there, I don't know if I got it correctly when I sent my fist
email

I support mentioning the tools exist in a tools list, but I don't think
is a good idea to mention specific characteristics for testing specific
issues, specially if only that tool have the ability, as we will be
making people (or at least make them thing they) depend on buying
commercial tools for doing proper testing according to OWASP.

Sorry if I send the wrong message initially

Regards,
Juan Carlos Calderon

Agreed thats why my original suggestion was to only mention the type
of tool that can be used (such as a web scanner) instead of listing
specific tools (such as webinspect)..  The tools list is only supposed
to give ideas of what can assist you in testing that specific section
so if we want to list just the type of tool or if we want to list
specific tools is up to the group to decide.  I am fine with either
way.we just need to be consistant with each section.

Mat,

As suggested previously, i think it would be a good idea to include a section on Encoded Injections under Data Validation Section i.e.Section 4.8.

Encodings like URL encoding, hex, etc is commonly used to bypass a few of the input validation filters. We could probably talk about the various encodings that are employed in order to obfuscate the injections.

I can contribute to this section if the list agrees on it's inclusion. 

Regards
Harish

I'm a recent entrant to this list, albeit late but I am very happy to be a part of this project. Thank you Mat.
 
Further, I've given the v3 proposed Table of Contents a quick look and i feel that it would be better if we add a section on Encoded injections in the Data Validation Section. Encodings like URL encoding, hex, etc - The kind of encoding that is usually used to obfuscate the injections in order to bypass generic/basic filtering mechanisms.
 
I feel this would be a good addition. List, provide your thoughts on this and advise if this is feasible.

Hi Harish,

   I'm Giorgio Fedon of Owasp Italy. I'm supporting Matteo in the
coordinating the project.

   We think that is a very good idea, but we need to locate the proper
section for this kind of content.
   Data Validation could be good, but also other sections could be
fine: also an appendix to create an "encoding cheat sheet".

   Let me know what do you think about, anyway very good Idea.

Hi Giorgio,

Thank you for your response. I felt that Encoded Injections would be better off as part of the Data Validation Section because it is in this section that we are going to talk about various injections like SQL Injections, XSS, LDAP Injections, XML Injections, etc

However, your suggestion of adding this as a cheat sheet in the appendix also sounds good. As part of this section, i intend to introduce the various encodings that are commonly used to obfuscate malicious injections and also cite a few examples (not like a cheat sheet though) 

Your thoughts on this, please.

Regards
Harish

Hi,
Mat Maybe is an error
4.11 Client site
testing<https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Client-Side_Testing&action=edit>
is
realy "Client site testing" or Client side testing ?

I think that we can include a section on Browser testing.

We kwow that broser based vulnerabilities are important, maybe we explore
and and show how to test a browser.

Ciao
Marco

I think that should be client-side, unless we are talking about how to  
perform on a client's site?

Danger Robinson on the browser fuzzing.

I understand where you are coming from, but this is a whole different  
level of testing. Client-side testing would be manipulating client- 
side controls often used in conjunction with the application. If we  
start looking at fuzzing the browsers and looking for issues, we have  
gone far away from the scope of the doc.

Hi Marco,

thank you very much Marco, it's our mistake.

We meant "Client Side Testing" about testing vulnerabilities inside
browsers or other commons such as RIA clients.

Would you like to join us?

See You Soon,

Giorgio

Hi Harish,

We were talking among us about this today, and we thought that would
be better having a section about encodings and techniques to bypass
filters in the appendix.

The Data Validation section is mainly to address specific
vulnerabilities. A filter bypass vulnerability could be seen as a
medium to get a particular attacks executed and could be something
useful also for vulnerabilities different from the ones in the Data
Validation section.

Inside the Testing Guide V2, there are a couple of sections were the
examples contained some particular encodings es. pg. 132.
I would very appreciate if you can have a look at those firstly, to
better integrate your content.

G.

Message-ID: <D07A74F9-B96E-4B7E-88EE-3C8E1DB8DD3F@kelronja.org>

I would like to volunteer to produce an extensive checklist for the v3  
guide.
I am thinking it should fall under an Appendix.
The checklist is currently being developed as an open office  
spreadsheet, but could be converted to a table in .PDF.
Recommendations for format?  It is most useful as a spreadsheet...

Hi Giorgio,

Thank you for the suggestion and I refer to the Testing Guide V2 on a regular basis. I concur with your view on encoded injections belonging to the Appendix section as it encompasses vulnerabilities belonging in the other sections as well e.g Web Services Testing, Testing for CSRF (Session Management Testing section), etc

Therefore, as part of this section (Encoded Injections) i will start with an introduction to the commonly used encoding schemes and how these may be used to bypass input validation filters. I will also cite a few examples to better illustrate the scenario.

I will start working on this once the necessary changes are made to the Index.

List, is there anything else that you think would be a good addition to this section on Encoded Injection?

Regards
Harish

We were talking among us about this today, and we thought that would
be better having a section about encodings and techniques to bypass
filters in the appendix.

The Data Validation section is mainly to address specific
vulnerabilities. A filter bypass vulnerability could be seen as a
medium to get a particular attacks executed and could be something
useful also for vulnerabilities different from the ones in the Data
Validation section.

Inside the Testing Guide V2, there are a couple of sections were the
examples contained some particular encodings es. pg. 132.
I would very appreciate if you can have a look at those firstly, to
better integrate your content.

Hi,
sure good idea! I'm working on it and added a section at the Index
(4.1.1 Testing Checklist):
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents

The checklist v2 is here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Introduction_and_objectives

Here is a first draft for v3:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist
What do you think about that?

I think it is important to collect all the security tests we will
perfom on v3 and the related vulnerability founded.
Also checklist is important to give a high level vision of our
project: I'd like to work also with Andrew (Building Guide) and Eoin
(Code Review Guide) to create 3 different checklists that togheter
make sense for the development, review and testing phase from a OWASP
point of view.
That makes sense for you?

Thanks,
Mat

Hi,
I have a checklist here, I did a number of years ago.:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Review_Introduction#The_Checklist
its a little old and needs updating but it covers mose of the bases.

Hello Harish,

This sounds like a great idea.  If you want you could build upon the
OWASP Fuzzing Code database and then show how each one of these
injections could be encoded for use in bypassing common filter methods

If Marco doesn't mind I don't either.

Marco, shall I peer-review your sections when you're done or do you have

I will merge all these checklists together.
In the mean time, I would like to post my current version for review/ 
comment.
What is the best way to do that?
To the Wiki?  As an .xls to be downloaded?
Thanks!

Hi Mat,

Thank you. I will start working on this soon.

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for the suggestion. I will surely take some inputs from OWASP Fuzzing Code database. However, showing how each one of the injections could be encoded would be overwhelming. But, i will certainly pick a few from the list.

Thank you again.

Regards
Harish

This sounds like a great idea.  If you want you could build upon the
OWASP Fuzzing Code database and then show how each one of these
injections could be encoded for use in bypassing common filter methods
