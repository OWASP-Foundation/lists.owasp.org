Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Testing Guide v4 TOC
Message-ID: <53ED1955.1030801@owasp.org>

Hello OWASP Testing Guide Team,

The v4 TOC for the Testing Guide is one of the top 15 most popular pages 
at OWASP in and of itself.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents

Many thousands of folks (15,000 or so per month) hit this page directly 
when looking for testing guide information.

Is there anything we can do to make this page more attractive? Perhaps 
give it a theme or add a paragraph at the top?

Thanks for considering,
Jim Manico
OWASP Wiki Editor/Cleanup Team

Just a polite note,

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection_(OTG-INPVAL-005)

... is one of the most popular pages at OWASP. Anything you can do to 
make this page look more attractive is helpful. But it does look up to 
date, correct?

Aloha,
Jim
