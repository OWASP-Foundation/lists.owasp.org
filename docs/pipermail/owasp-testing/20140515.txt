(Resent due to message size issue and moderation settings.)

I just had a thought: As part of the intro or announcement of completion can we make a statement about plans for v5?

Perhaps something along the lines of:

?Think you have ideas or concepts to contribute to our next Testing Guide? Willing to review/edit content? For Version 5 of the Testing Guide we?ll be aiming to start collaborative preparation of the draft Aug-2015, complete review cycles in early 2016, and publish mid-2016. If you?d like to take part please join the testing guide mailing list (https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing) to be kept in the loop.?

(Dates are just made up, we could push then 1 or 1.5 years..whatever we can get agreement on.)

I think by doing so we?d promote community involvement plus have lots of notice and a goal for those already involved.

Rick
