<PRE>OK Gents

As always I would love to have had more time on this today than I did
but it is moving again. I will complete more tomorrow (and later
tonight) but I wanted to send out an update.

I am not sure about you but I like to work by creating the headings and
then filling in the details when the big picture is good. I am starting
to really like the flow we have now. 

Responsibilities are;

Chapter 1 - MC
Chapter 2 ?
Chapter 3 - JC
Chapter 4 - MC (done but not added or formatted)
Chapter 5 - CD
Chapter 6 - MC
Appendix A - ?
Appendix B - ?

For the two appendices, I think the aim is to focus on quality rather
than list every book, paper or tool we can find.

Let me know if you want to take on 2 or the Appendices. 

Also there are big holes in Chapter 3 i.e. no pen testing overview or
documentation / design testing overview.

Of the source code section in there today, my personal thoughts are it
is bordering in the how (i.e. prescribing things to test for) rather
than describing the process. Thoughts ?

Lots more to come tomorrow.
