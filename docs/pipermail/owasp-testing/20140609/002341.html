<PRE>If anyone has any concerns about an individual's conduct on OWASP mailing
lists then they should report them to the OWASP Compliance officer as per
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Whistleblower_Policy">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Whistleblower_Policy</A>
This is the correct way forward, and I'm sure that the number of complaints
against an individual will be taken into account.

Cheers,

Simon

&gt;<i> Jason you are absolutely correct and this type of accusations and

</I>&gt;<i> The reality is that Christian (as you can see on this thread) is the one
</I>&gt;<i> that tends to behave like that. There has been many 'arguments' and 'owasp

</I>&gt;<i> conversion to the table.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Christian has already been banned (at least) twice in the past from OWASP,
</I>&gt;<i> and after many requests (by many parties) the current board (which should

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *My biggest problem with Christian's behaviour is not the accusations that
</I>&gt;<i> he makes *(although I have to say that being one of the many in the
</I>&gt;<i> receiving end of such personal attacks ,is not nice at all (specially when
</I>&gt;<i> he makes accusations about OWASP activities that took a lot of effort and
</I>&gt;<i> personal sacrifice)), *my biggest problem is the idea that such behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> is accepted/tolerated at OWASP*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP SHOULD NOT tolerate that type of behaviour, from anyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't mean that we should not disagree with each other, of course
</I>&gt;<i> we should, BUT it is key that the discussion is kept on a professional
</I>&gt;<i> level and there is a minimum level of respect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And of course, if some OWASP leader or contributor feels that something is
</I>&gt;<i> really wrong , then yes that should be reported (with evidence supporting
</I>&gt;<i> it). But that is not what Christian does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So please, can the OWASP board deal with this type of accusations! There
</I>&gt;<i> have been too many OWASP leaders and key contributors offended, which is
</I>&gt;<i> really the big loss here.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've been watching this mail thread evolve in a mixture of shock and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disappointment. I've have been the leader of a volunteer security group in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dublin, I've been attacked, I've been publicly questioned, I've been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> insulted. As the leader my hands were tied, as I was supposed to raise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myself above the natural human reaction I wanted to have. In times like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this it was great when the community itself would *jump in* and define what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it would tolerate from it's members, both at a project level but also at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the human level of how we engage and communicate with each other.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this group - I am not on the board. I am one of the voices, freed from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the constraints of political correctness and being the &quot;better man&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have witnessed highly insulting name calling with the *turncoat*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statement, potentially professionally damaging statements about disgruntled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> employee behavior, organisational corruption insinuated with the nepotism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theory's [without reference to the skill sets of those hired] even leaning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> towards accusing someone of embezzlement of funds.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The tone, the attitude and sentiment of these communications need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stop. The corruption &quot;facts&quot; need to be elevated out of this arena, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into a far more formalized process. Public slander should not be tolerated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at any level, least of all between the OWASP community itself. Jokes and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jibes are part an parcel of any group. I do not see the humor in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread. Just ego.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We are a very small community - I've met Simon, twice. I saw Dinis once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at an OWASP gig in Dublin maybe 4 years ago. I looked at O2 as a potential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project to bring into my day job to help with automation, but at the time I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> found it a bit prototypy for a rollout. I have not looked at it since. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be great now, It could be worse.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am stating this so you can understand I am not friends, or married to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cousins of key stake holders or go for walks with OWASP board members dogs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My opinions are my own. My linked in profile is at least 4 years out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> date, I don't do face book - so apologies to the background checkers. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hostile nature of this communication thread needs to end. I'll go even one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> step further - and explain myself in World cup terms.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my opinion - someone has just been tackled in the box and the striker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has gone down. The referee has to make the decision. Was there a foul
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> committed or did the striker take a dive? One thing is certain, at this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point it's not O.K to wave play on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Compile your evidence of corruption. Send it discreetly to the board. Let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the powers that be evaluate it.  If the allegations are determined to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unjustified - its either a red card offence or a yellow, the referee can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decide. Or there is a penalty due that will change the course of the game.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Arguably if this matter had of been handled more discreetly I do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think a yellow/red card would be justified irrespective of the result. At
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this point I am not so sure. People should question and protest, it's how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they question - the medium they choose, and their approach that is subject
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to review.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also do not believe any project status should be above review. I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downgrading everything - and then upgrading was potentially the fairest and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cleanest approach. Surely that technique is symbolic that the OWASP board
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not playing favorites.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will not get involved in any further communication on this thread. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will not reply to any response to this note. This is a toxic hostile thread
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that needs to stop in it's current format. Compile the evidence, put it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forward and OWASP should clean house to suit the desired result of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inquiry.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't have an issue with Simon but the fact is Michael Coates, him
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and you have all worked for Mozilla and yet OWASP invested in WebScrab
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the past.  In Simon's defence he probably didn't know about
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> WebScrab because OWASP didn't help with the promotion of known
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> projects since hired Dinis Cruz hired personal friends to promote his
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> own projects.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On the contrary, I was very aware of WebScarab and its importance to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OWASP at the time - I half expected my application for ZAP to become an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OWASP project to be rejected due to the clear overlap with WebScarab.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I wanted to create a powerful but easy to use security tool for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> developers, and I seriously considered using WebScarab as the basis for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that tool.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However while WebScarab had much more of the functionality that I wanted
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> than Paros did, I found WebScarab very complicated and unintuitive.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I decided that I would rather add functionality to Paros than try to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> make WebScarab easier to use, and I've not regretted that decision :)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do agree that OWASP has not been very effective at promoting any of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> its projects, including ZAP.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However I'm not going to point fingers at any individuals.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OWASP is primarily a volunteer organization, and its up to all of us to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> address issues that we are concerned with.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> While I think OWASP could do a better job of promoting all of its
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> projects I dont have any big ideas how that could be achieved - marketing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is not my area of expertise ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I dont like criticizing unless I can offer constructive alternatives.
