<PRE>Hi Ras,

As a 3rd party I don't think it is appropriate to supplement a vulnerability
write-up with a patch or explicit code change, but my position is not based
on a concern for liability from a legal perspective.

Working on a point in time, 3rd party security assessment, you probably are
working from the perspective of someone who has been brought into the
project without all of the history and knowledge the system, the development
lifecycle, coding standards, etc.  In addition to this, there could be
challenges with the level of acceptance of your findings from the
development team, particularly in the case where you are seen as an
outsider.  Any of these things can result in developers focusing on finding
fault with your patch or code sample rather than focusing on the intent of
your recommendation which is to help them improve the product they are
working on.

When I detail a write-up on an assessment where I have access to code, I
will typically include specific guidance that calls out exactly what steps
need to be taken (for example: &quot;on line 248, ensure that the parameter
pwHash is verified to only contain hexadecimal characters, and only the
correct number of characters in length for the hashing algorithm in use&quot;).
If there is a suitable framework reference for implementing my
recommendations I will link to that, and ensure that if the developers
require explicit assistance in developing or re-engineering the code I am
happy to work collaboratively with them on the issue.
