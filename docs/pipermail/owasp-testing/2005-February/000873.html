<PRE>The following was announced previously but additional information about the agenda and hotel information, including inexpensive rooms right at Royal Holloway is now available on the OWASP site, as described below. Also, for all questions about the conference, please contact me (Dave Wichers [now the OWASP Conferences Chair), rather than Jeff Williams (the OWASP Chair).

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is proud to announce its second Application Security Conference to be held April 9-10 near London. The OWASP AppSec Europe 2005 Conference is just a short 2 months away and since there's limited seating, be sure to register early to reserve your seat and support the not-for-profit OWASP Foundation. Check out the OWASP website at <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005europe.html">http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005europe.html</A> for all the details.

You'll hear great speakers like:

 - Denis Verdon (Head of CISG, Fidelity National Financial)
 - Dr. Charles Pfleeger (Author of Security in Computing)
 - Jeff Williams (OWASP Chair and CEO, Aspect Security)
 - Dinis Cruz (Leader of the OWASP .NET project)
 - Rogan Dawes (Author of WebScarab)
 - Ivan Ristic (Author of ModSecurity)
 - Arian Evans (Session Management and Testing Tools)

The full agenda and schedule is available at: <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005europe/agendae05.html">http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005europe/agendae05.html</A>

AppSec Europe 2005 is April 9-10 at Royal Holloway, University of London --  home of one of the best InfoSec programs in Europe and featured in the Da Vinci Code. OWASP's AppSec conferences are dedicated to real-world application security issues and solutions. You'll learn all aspects of application security, including people, process, and technology perspectives.

You'll hear presentations on topics like:

  - OWASP Status, Direction, and new Projects
  - Web Application Testing Tools and Techniques
  - A Review of Existing Application Security Products/Test Tools
  - Web Services Security
  - .NET Security
  - Web Application Intrusion Detection
  - Advanced Attack and Defense Techniques
  - How to Contract for Secure Software
  - Lessons Learned in the Trenches

By participating you'll have a direct opportunity to help shape and influence the direction of OWASP in 2005.

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a not-for-profit we have been able to keep the cost to &#163;150 (or $280) per seat which is significantly less than what most conferences cost.
