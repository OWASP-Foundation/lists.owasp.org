Sorry for the late response. But I have not been able to review this 
until today. As for the outline:

- Why is it all &quot;Appendix&quot; instead of &quot;Chapter&quot; ?

- I don't believe having a &quot;Languages specific testing&quot; in Appendix D 
is appropiate. IMHO it would be best if, for the different way to find 
vulnerabilities samples were provided for the most common languages.
For example:
	- If you are code reviewing a PHP application and looking for SQL 
injection, find the calls to the underlying Database code 
(DB-&gt;Execute($sql) if using the ADO database access) and review the 
checks introduced in parameters used for constructing the $sql call.
	- If you are code reviewing a Java application and looking for errors 
in the authentication phase, look for servlets in the &quot;user-only&quot; area 
that don't include the code to check for a valid session in the 
application server
	(etc..)

Having a &quot;Services&quot; specific section (XML, SOAP, etc.) is OK.

- In the &quot;Authentication&quot; of Appendix B I think it's worth reviewing 
also the implementation of the authentication mechanism on the client 
side. I.e. are password fields marked as such, can a rogue user 
&quot;shoulder surfer&quot; the passwords. I've seen some banks implement a 
PIN-based mechanism with client-side keyboards (so that the user needs 
to click on the button instead of writing the PIN) that are very prone 
to should surfering. Even if they have been introduced to avoid trojan 
keyloggers they are still vulnerable both to screen capture trojans 
and to &quot;close-by&quot; users.

- Application DoS: I think adding testing for overflows should be 
appropiate here. Since an overflow might crash the application, the 
underlying database or the application server itself.

- Access Control: Shouldn't also &quot;roles&quot; be reviewed? I.e. if there is 
a different role for group of users (simple user, advanced user, etc.) 
the application should be reviewed to assure that a user cannot access 
applications that belong to a different role.

- Configuration Management Infrastructure: I think it's worth adding 
checks on how new versions are uploaded:
	- Is there a pre-production environment? Is it Internet-accessible?
	- Is the Internet used for application changes? Is access control 
properly enforced in upload points? (I've seen web sites using FTP 
uploads to different servers in order to update the applications 
deployed through batch processes, these FTP sites become an issue if 
the code can be downloaded from them or modified by a rogue user)

- Configuration Management Application: I miss the following:
	- Unnecesary modules active (very common in people using the default 
Apache configuration provided by Oracle iAS)
	- System User running the application (is it root/Administrator? is 
it a different user?)
	- Web server jails (chroot/uml/jail, etc.) I.e. Does a compromise of 
the web server directly grant local user access to the full system?

- Data protection:
	- Storage of user passwords (in the clear, encrypted?)
	- User used to access the backend databases (is it a system user? 
sample: web applications using the 'sys' user to access an Oracle 
backend).
	- Local permissions of the static content and deployed software. 
(i.e. can any local user accessing the web server modify the web 
pages? is code that might contain sensible information readable by 
local (non-web) users?)

- Parameter manipulation:
	- Uploaded files content (Sometimes files are uploaded and handled by 
different applications. Consider a web e-mail GUI that allows 
attachments and those attachments are passed over to some encoder that 
might be vulnerable)

- &quot;Appendix B - Finding Specific Vulnerabilities using Penetration 
Testing - Input injection&quot; and &quot;Appendix C - Finding Specific 
Vulnerabilities using Source Code&quot;: Hopefully the content we wrote a 
few years back could be reused here :-)

- Appendix E &#8211; Tools used for Testing. I think it's best if we divide 
them in:
	- Transparent proxies
	- Black-box scanners
	- Source code scanners


Hope that helps

Javier
