Hi all, 
I've reviewed the ToC and add a new paragraph for each new issue to write. 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v4_Table_of_Contents#4._Web_Application_Penetration_Testing 

For example a new article will be like that: 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_pollution_%28OWASP-DV-004%29 

Regarding the set of articles to review I linked the v3 articles with 
the idea to modify that. 
For example: 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_%28OWASP-DV-001%29 

So from now the wiki will be our draft for v4 and v3 will be available 
only via PDF. 

Many of you are not assigned to an article. 
Please, from now tell me what section would you like to write. We have 
to assign all the articles in the next few days. 

Feedback: The Toc is completed at 90%, please send me your feedback 
about the new ToC and my notes in the Toc. 

Now we can start writing! 
Please keep me update (I monitor all the changes on the wiki). Use the 
ml for general discussion and my email for specific issues. 

Thanks, 
Mat

Hi Andrew,
We started writing to have a first draft of the guide soon.
Then we can review the ToC and understand what we can improve.
Make sense?

Thanks,
Mat
