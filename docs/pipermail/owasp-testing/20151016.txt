Subject: [Owasp-testing] hsecscan v0 (https://github.com/riramar/hsecscan)
Message-ID: <CAE5Wca3Yxhm0PA6KeQaPx2Rys-7HGyoQJzwZX8TRGRbbRazfAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I started to develop in python a dumb tool called hsecscan
(https://github.com/riramar/hsecscan). I'll appreciate any feedback.
:)
It's a security scanner for HTTP response headers. Just finished the
usable version 0 with a few features.

$ ./hsecscan.py
usage: hsecscan.py [-h] [-P] [-p] [-u URL] [-R]

A security scanner for HTTP response headers.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -P, --database     Print the entire response headers database.
  -p, --headers      Print only the enabled response headers from database.
  -u URL, --URL URL  The URL to be scanned.
  -R, --redirect     Print redirect headers.


The code itself is short because I spent most of my time constructing
the sqlite database. You can check the database content on hsecscan.db
(sqlite) or hsecscan.tsv (tab separated value).
Most of the headers came from
https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml
and the security description/reference/recommendation came from the
related RFC. I also include all headers from
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers. The idea
is keep the database up-to-date and if you want you can add your
headers.
Since this is version 0 I didn't include all the features that I want
and this is my personal TODO list:

Improve output to highlight the required headers
Add option to select the method (GET or POST)
Improve README.md with more information (eg. how to use as a module)
Add options to show only the enabled headers
Add option to select the User-Agent header or set any other header
Add option to detect bad practice (eg. Content-Type without charset=utf-8)


Basically "hsecscan.py -u http://google.com" will do a GET on
google.com over HTTP and retrieve all the headers. For each header
hsecscan.py will search on the database and print the results. If you
select the option "-R" hsecscan.py will also print results for each
redirect response header.

  Header Field Name: X-XSS-Protection
  Type 1: Personal
  Protocol: http
  Status:
  Reference: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/07/02/ie8-security-part-iv-the-xss-filter.aspx
  Type 2: Response
  Enable: Y
  Required: Y
  HTTPS: N
  Security Description: This header enables the Cross-site scripting
(XSS) filter built into most recent web browsers. It's usually enabled
by default anyway, so the role of this header is to re-enable the
filter for this particular website if it was disabled by the user.
This header is supported in IE 8+, and in Chrome (not sure which
versions). The anti-XSS filter was added in Chrome 4. Its unknown if
that version honored this header.
  Security Reference:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers
  Recommendations: Use "X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block" whenever is
possible (ref. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/01/31/controlling-the-internet-explorer-xss-filter-with-the-x-xss-protection-http-header.aspx).

  Type 2: Response
  Enable: Y
  Required: N
  HTTPS: N
  Security Description: Cookies have a number of security pitfalls. In
particular, cookies encourage developers to rely on ambient authority
for authentication, often becoming vulnerable to attacks such as
cross-site request forgery. Also, when storing session identifiers in
cookies, developers often create session fixation vulnerabilities.
Transport-layer encryption, such as that employed in HTTPS, is
insufficient to prevent a network attacker from obtaining or altering
a victim's cookies because the cookie protocol itself has various
vulnerabilities. In addition, by default, cookies do not provide
confidentiality or integrity from network attackers, even when used in
conjunction with HTTPS.
  Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-8
  Recommendations: Please at least read these references:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-8 and
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Cookies.

  Type 2: Response
  Enable: Y

  Security Description: Overly long and detailed Server field values
increase response latency and potentially reveal internal
implementation details that might make it (slightly) easier for
attackers to find and exploit known security holes.
  Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.4.2
  Recommendations: An origin server SHOULD NOT generate a Server field
containing needlessly fine-grained detail and SHOULD limit the
addition of subproducts by third parties.

  Type 2: Response
  Enable: Y
  Required: Y

  Security Description: The use of "X-Frame-Options" allows a web page
from host B to declare that its content (for example, a button, links,
text, etc.) must not be displayed in a frame (<frame> or <iframe>) of
another page (e.g., from host A). This is done by a policy declared in
the HTTP header and enforced by browser implementations.
  Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034
  Recommendations:  In 2009 and 2010, many browser vendors
([Microsoft-X-Frame-Options] and [Mozilla-X-Frame-Options]) introduced
the use of a non-standard HTTP [RFC2616] header field
"X-Frame-Options" to protect against clickjacking. Please check here
