Hi guys,

1) Make sure you using the latest release - 1.0.15 from
http://www.sensepost.com/research/eor/

2) web proxy version 1.008 does support SSL (proxy port 5112). Used it
many many times for SSL enabled sites. If you need locations for where to
get this let me know.

Please read the docs that comes with it. If it still bitches about parsing
please speak to me off-list and we'll fix it up.

Regards,
Roelof.

Hi Roelof,
Thansk for this.
I am using 1.0.15

The documenattion says that when you make a new project EoR creates a new 
directory:
source/@stake/
For me is creates an "output" directory where I place the text generated 
webproxy log file.

When using Webproxy SSL I get the following error:

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 
sun.security.x509.X509Cert.encodeAndSign(Lsun/secur
ity/util/BigInt;Lsun/security/x509/X500Signer;)[B
  at com.atstake.web.WebProxyCertificateGen.createCertificate(Unknown 
Source)
        at 
com.atstake.web.WebProxySocketAbstraction.layerClientSslSocket(Unknown 
Source)
        at com.atstake.web.WebProxyHttpsConnection.run(Unknown Source)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:534)

Anyways, when I place the .txt file from the 
"WebProxy1.0r1.008\logs\06-Oct-2005\" directory to the  \output\ directory 
and press "Load Request" I get the HTTP parsing error.


Thanks,
Eoin

OK..I'll reply to the list..but I suspect we should take it off list
soon..;)

The documentation is a bit dodgy I think...well...ok..it is for sure. The
old version created @stake directory - the new one simply says output/.
You should drop your filewriter output in the root of the project - the
generated output would go in the /output diretory.

> When using Webproxy SSL I get the following error:
> --snip---

when you install @stake proxy you have the choice to install your own Java
run time or one that is bundled. I know there are problems with using your
own...so I always use the one that comes with the package. Perhaps that's
part of the problem? Anyone else with 1.008 having SSL issues? I've
installed this many times and used SSL without any problem.

Is it possible to get your webproxy filewriter output (I know it might be
sensitive)? Then I can start checking where it breaks in the parsing
routines. As something to quickly try - walk the app again - but set HTML
output in the filewriter to FALSE...and try again.

Hope this helps,
Roelof.

Daniel,

if you like, give the document to me, and I will convert it to the  
Guide master document format over the weekend.

thanks,
Andrew
