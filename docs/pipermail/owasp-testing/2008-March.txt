Subject: [Owasp-testing] OWASP Testing Guide v2 vs. v1
Message-ID: <cea583440803040644y186c42afq98b8f95e5b8fb1d9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi , I was recently reviewing the version 2 testing guide
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_doc.zip, I was
wondering if this is meant to compliment the older version 1 checklists/docs
or replace them?

Looking at the table in v2 (pgs 34 & 35) for example, does "OWASP-AT-001 :
Default or guessable account" replace the older "OWASP-AUTHN-004 : Default
Accounts"?

I'm guessing that v2 replaces the older stuff since there seems to be a lot
of overlap, but I wanted to confirm since v2 does not seem to cover
absolutely everything that v1 did (OWASP-DP-001 for example). The
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Project page does not make this
clear at all.

I'm also curious about the status of v3.

Hi Thorin,
yes the OWASP Testing Guide v2 completely replace the v1. Here is the
revision history:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Guide_Frontispiece#Revision_History

Here you can find the new set of controls:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing:_Introduction_and_objectives

We are planning to begin the new project regarding v3. Keep tuned.

Thanks,

Hello,

Alessio has put a new version of the OWASP code review tool, Code crawler,
available for download.
It has a totally new look and feel and also runs SQL Server express for the
definitions.
The source is available also. Suggestions on new functionality are welcome.

Code crawler is a complementary tool associated with definitions defined in
the code review guide. It works best using both the guide and tool together.
Remember this is a beta tool, stable, but much functionality to implement.
It can be downloaded from the OWASP code review project site:

Hi list,

I noticed that the OWASP Testing Guide has a section on "Infrastructure Configuration Management Testing" (Section 4.2.5), but the report chart on page 256 doesn't appear to have to have a line item for it. It skips from "Spidering and Googling" to "Analysis of Error code".

Is there a reason for this? Or is it an oversight?

Yes,
This was a test to see if people actually read the book.
Well done :)

It shall be tackled in V3 (Matteo??) :)

That's great Eoin! :D

You are right Brad, "Infrastructure Configuration Management Testing"
is not included in the report chart because the following:
- Testing Web Application Fingerprint
- Application Discovery
- Spidering and Googling
- Analysis of Error Codes
- SSL/TLS Testing
- DB Listener Testing
- Testing for File Extensions Handling
- Old, backup and unreferenced files
are a subset of "Information Gathering" and "Infrastructure
Configuration Management Testing".

Yes, we are planning to rewrite the Testing Guide, so we can explain
better this issue in the new one.
So keep in touch for the new project.

Thanks,
Mat

Hi Matteo,
Can I suggest you do a RIA (Rich Internet Application) section in the
Testing Guide V3.
This would cover items such as Ajax and Flash (including mashups etc)

Hi Eoin and Stephen,
yes those are good points, client side testing (RIA and Java applet,
Flash, ecc) are becoming nowadays too much important and we have to
include that.

This is my idea for the new Testing Guide:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Startup

If OWASP Board will approve that we will start with a new
brainstorming before creating the new Guide.

Thanks!
Mat

Yes, I think the AJAX section needs a lot of improvement, I'm starting 
to see demand on how to test rich client applications.

>

But I don't think the chapter in the Testing Guide should be "AJAX 
testing" it should be "Rich client testing" and (try to) cover 
technologies such as Ajax, Java applets, Flex, Silverlight, Flash, and 
other tecnologies. Changing the name of the chapter would make it have a 
broader approach and it could start by talking about the generic issues 
in these type of applications and then cover samples with specific 
technologies.

As for your idea for the new Testing Guide I don't think you should 
strike out "Information gathering" and "Business logic testing". 
Information gathering is a quite important phase in testing and "info" 
vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities in themselves. Being able to 
fingerprint the web server, the application server, the database or any 
other technologies is important in making it possible to drive other 
attacks.

Just my 2c.

Javier

Maybe a bit slow on this one but I'd thought I'd share it

A PCI compliant company was compromised and an estimate of 4.2 million cc
numbers were obtained.
The issue arises that the company were PCI compliant and now the blame game
has ensued. The PCI assessors are being blamed, there is mention of
ambiguity regarding the PCI standard, where to apply some of the technical
controls etc..

Message-ID: <E13DBC18-9DC8-492C-BF2F-6F6498717A0F@owasp.org>

I really doubt that Hannaford was PCI DSS compliant:

* Requirement 3 - Protect Card Holder Data. Losing 4.2 million records  
requires failing Section 3.1 "Keep cardholder data to a  
minimum" (basically ditch the PAN and expiry as soon as you're done  
with them), and Section 3.4 "Render PAN, unreadable anywhere where it  
is stored". FAIL.

* Requirement 6 - Section 6.1, keeping up with patches. I don't know  
of any site that meets PCI's 1 month deadline to install new patches  
for critical components. It would be surprising to me if Hannaford did  
this. Possible fail.

* Section 6.5 - do a Top 10 review. This is the old Top 10 2004. 6.5.8  
is "Insecure storage" - enough said! FAIL

* Requirement 10 - Monitor and Test Networks and Requirement 11  
Regularly Test security systems and processes. In particular section  
10.6:

"Review logs for all system components at least daily. Log reviews  
must include those servers that perform security functions like  
intrusion detection system (IDS) and authentication, authorization,  
and accounting protocol (AAA) servers (for example, RADIUS)."

and 11.3.2 - conduct annual application layer pen tests
and 11.4 and 11.5 which says to install network and host IDS and  
network IPS and file integrity monitoring software. These should have  
immediately notified admin staff of changes.

Hannaford didn't detect the breach for nearly three months. That  
implies a lack of effective intrusion detection and monitoring EVEN if  
they had the above items in place, operational, and logging  
successfully, and someone is monitoring them. Which I highly doubt.  
FAIL.

Arguable:

* Section 6.6 - mandates a code review or a web application firewall,  
but only AFTER JUNE 30. They can be compliant up to now with neither  
of these in place. We know that WAFs today are simply not enough to  
prevent attacks from a motivated, skilled attacker. They are great  
defense in depth and they do knock out script kiddie attacks. If  
Hannaford obtained a code review, then the assessor wasn't  
particularly good, or the firm refused to fix known issues, or both. I  
think this is the area we will see the lawyers involved with if it can  
be argued that 6.6 is REQUIRED to be complied with today. I don't  
believe so.

In my personal opinion, even given the limited information that is  
public, from the first two issues above alone, we can assume Hannaford  
were/are non-compliant.

PCI DSS makes it abundantly clear what folks must do to be safer:

Step 1.  Don't store CC numbers. Really, really, really don't store  
them. You don't need them.
Steps 2..153 However, if you want to damage your business reputation,  
destroy customer confidence, lose shareholder value, set a bunch of  
money on fire by protecting information you don't need (and shouldn't  
want), then here goes... do this wishy-washy list of items. But do it  
properly, or you'll get pwned.

Hannaford ignored #1 and got pwned even though they did *some* of the  
next 153 steps required for PCI DSS. In PCI DSS 1.2, they really  
should make it real short and sweet:

There are no valid business reasons for storing CC's. If you do, you  
fail PCI DSS compliance. This is how you use authorization numbers for  
these common business cases:

That's a one pager in my view.

Hi Andrew,
Congrats is in order btw.
I believe Hannaford were PCI compliant according the information at hand.
Which highlights the meaning of compliance as opposed to secure. Compliance
is simply a business enabler to show "we are making an effort" as opposed to
the esoteric "we are secure" statement IMO.

Re OWASP Top 10 compliant we, OWASP have a big issue here as many of the
vendors of scanning tools have an "OWASP Top 10" rule base that can be used.
OWASP have not been consulted on this to my knowledge so if one runs this
rule base and it comes up with no issues they can say they are OWASP Top 10
compliant. - plain silly IMHO

Also "Develop all web applications based on secure coding guidelines such as
the Open Web Application Security Project guidelines." - Sure they can do
that and say they do seen as OWASP does not have verification or
certification criteria. Who's to say they are not doing this, We have the
OWASP guides, dev, test and review but no certification.

Also one can be compliant and certified as such, next day not be compliant
but certified as compliant for the next 3 months until the next audit.

Expiration date & PAN are allowed to be stored (is a secure manner) but it
seems that the data was intercepted in transit (correct me if I am wrong).
Re storing CC numbers (PANS) many large popular store such numbers such as
Amazon.com, Play.com etc to "enhance the customer experience" and let the
customer purchase via 1-click.
