I think it would have been better for an agreed statement to go out at the
same time as the demotion.
The 'silent' demotion doesnt send the right message - we should be very
open in these sort of matters.

I agree Simon, that was a mistake. The intention was to send it out weeks
ago, but we've been waiting to get full board approval since it's a board
message. I just got the ok yesterday and will post the official notice in a
few hours. But I agree, the timing was less than perfect and I'm sorry for
that.

The announcement on flagship status just went out to the leaders list 
and the main community list.

Christian, your concearns about my ulterior motive are totally fair. 
That is why this was a board vote (unanimous) and note a decision that 
was made on my own.

The next step is to simply re-apply for flagship (or similar) status 
once the new project rating mechanisms are in place.

I am sorry for anyone who was offended here. I hope the announcement 
explains why the board did what we did.

Aloha,
Jim
