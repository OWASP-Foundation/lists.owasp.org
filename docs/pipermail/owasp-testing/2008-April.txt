Subject: [Owasp-testing] Testing Guide Version 1 vs Version 2 Side-by-side
	(V3 Prep)
Message-ID: <cea583440804080716u4360c09bi41112ef9aecffb50@mail.gmail.com>

I thought this might be handy while getting ready for V3. We can add an
additional set of columns etc...

There are some questions in the Notes column which should probably be
clarified as we start planning v3 so that we ensure all bases are covered.

I know I could have or maybe even should have put this on the wiki somewhere
but I didn't have time to figure out tables in a wiki context. If someone
else feels like putting it up or editing/commenting on it please feel free.

Hello List,

I have some years of professional expierence with conducting pentests of web applications and would like to offer my modest help for
this interesting project of yours.

How could I do this ? Are there any sub groups for certain topics ?

For instance, I suppose I could constribute some content to the upcomming AJAX/Flash/Java Applets test cases. Also, I came up with
the following new (?) topics that might probably be of interest for the guide:

Data Validation - Testing CRLF Injection / HTTP Response Splitting
Data Validation - Testing Link Spoofing / Injection
Data Validation - Testing Second Order Code Injection
Input Validation - Testing  File Uploads (e.g. for malicious file upload possibilities)
Input Validation - HTML/Rich Content
Web Services Testing - Testing Known Framework Vulnerabilities
Web Services Testing - Testing SOAP Error Handling
Authentication Testing - Testing Anti-Enumeration Measures (e.g. CAPTCHAs)

Regards,

Matthias

Hi Matthias,

Those look like some great topics for the testing guide.  Would love it if
you would contribute them.  The best way is just to dive in and start
writing!  There are a lot of people monitoring changes to the wiki, so don't
worry about making mistakes, people will see them and update your pages.

Thanks!

	participation)
Message-ID: <d2d9d92d0804301610yf88ece3pe13f6b2167424b22@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
the new OWASP Testing Project v3 is started!

We want to review the OWASP Testing Project v2 and create the OWASP
Testing Guide v3 by the end of next August.

Problem to be Addressed:
many additional sections should be updated and reviewed. Also
additional areas of discovery should be addressed. the guide currently
covers alot but could cover much more.

Benefit to OWASP Members and Community:
A reference to the testing community that is updated by the community.
Should provide many of the answers one would look for when testing an
application for security.

Goals and Deliverables:
The guide to be updated with a defined list of topics and the current
guide reviewed.A revised and updated Testing Guide which shall be more
extensive thanever before.

*** I phase: create the Index ***
- Call for participation.
Work is underway on the 1st phase of the testing guide v3, and we
would love to hear from volunteers who could offer their knowledge in
creating this phase. If you have knowledge and experience in
application testing, and can spare a few hours a week, please contact
me and subscribe to our ml. Everyone can partecipate to write the new
Guide. If you are interested, please contact me.
This is the draft of the new index:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents
- Index brainstorming.
- Discuss the article content.
Deadline: Sun 18th May 2008.

*** II phase: start writing ***
After creating the new Index, we will assign each paragraph to the
volunteers, and we start writing!
Each author will write the article on the wiki and reviewed by the
OWASP Testing guide team.
Deadline: 30th June 2008

*** III phase: start reviewing ***
Create the reviewer team.
Assign each new paragraph to the reviewer.
Deadline: 20th July 2008

*** IV phase: Finalize the Guide ***
