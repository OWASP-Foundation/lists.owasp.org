Breaking Apps:  An Introduction to Web Application Pentesting

This is a 6-hour intensive survey of web security from the vantage point
of professional app breakers, delivered over two consecutive Wednesday
evenings.
We're offering a brief intro to the principles of application security,
followed by hands-on exercises aimed at getting you started actually
exploiting application security vulnerabilities. We'll be using Burp
Suite, the industry standard tool for web pentesting, and using it to
uncover functionality, capture and manipulate HTTP requests, and exploit
a wide variety of common and subtle flaws.

Who

Developers who want to know more about the threats their apps face, or
want to wipe the smug looks off the face of their next appsec audit team.
QA/QC testers or devops staff who want to integrate more app security
testing into their testing, staging, and monitoring plans.
Network security staff who want to move "up the stack" into app testing,
and are looking for a strong, assertive push. Particularly testers who
have been leaning on automated scanners and would like to lose the crutch.

When
Wednesday, October 19 (Part I: Introduction, Toolchain, Discovery,
Manipulation) 6-9pm
Wednesday, October 26 (Part II: Injection) 6-9pm

Where
Mountain View's beautiful Hacker Dojo, located at 140A South Whisman
Rd, Mountain View, CA 94041

Cost
CHEAP AS FREE.
This is an open-enrollment, zero cost event. Enrollment is limited, so
sign up early.

Prerequisites
An interest in breaking web applications. That's mostly it.
No previous experience in web application penetration testing expected
or required.
A working knowledge of web development on any stack, from J2EE to
Django, would be helpful but is not absolutely required.
You will need to bring a laptop with wireless functionality.
We will send some introductory reading material and toolchain setup
instructions to registered students prior to class.

Anti-Prerequisites
If you have experience with testing proxies, finding cross-site
scripting, exploiting Clickjacking and blind SQL injection, spidering
applications, and all that stuff: this isn't for you. (If you want to
help teach, we'd love to talk to you).
High-level outline
    .    Introduction to Web Application Security Principles
    .    Building your toolchain
    .    Discovering content and mapping the attack surface
    .    Manipulating Requests, including exploiting Insecure Direct
Object References
    .    Injection Attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection
    .    Automating Injection Attacks

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] To OWASP Buddies - Invitation to ISC's Open House -
	Sept 20th
Message-ID: <6FC58FEE-A550-48C2-98A3-AE51DF521FAC@senki.org>


Hi Team,

Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) is inviting the OWASP Peers along with many others in Silicon Valley for our Open House on September 20th @ 6:30 PM - 9:00 PM in our infamous "950 Charter" warehouse. 

The entire ISC Team is physically in town - including our operational security crew building the tools used in the latest take downs. This is an opportunity to have quality time with "Dr." Paul Vixie (yes, Paul just got his PhD). This would be a excellent time to talk directly to the engineers working on BIND, DHCP, AFTR/PCP, F-Root, the Operational Security work, Security Information Exchange (SIE), and the new Open Source Routing Forum (OSRF). 

Please forward this invitation to others inside your organization. Please share with your colleagues in the industry. Network Engineers, DNS admins, staff maintaining DHCP, and operational security people would all find value through informal whiteboard sessions.  

-> DNS and DHCP operators, this is a good time to talk directly to our super-geeks, whiteboard problems, and see our open source work. 

-> Security people, this is the right time to privately talk to our security people working tools that are used to track and whack the badness. Find out what is really happening on the latest BOTNET take downs and the Conficker work. DNSDB will be demonstrated along with ways security professionals can use it as a tool to protect their site.

-> Network & data center people, we can walk through the new Open Source Routing Forum where we use our experience building code critical to the Internet and invest in Quagga.

Please use this link to register: http://bit.ly/ISCevent092011

Heavy Hors D'oeuvres are served along with opportunities to win ISC "souvenirs."

DATE: Tuesday, 20 September 2011 TIME: 6:30 PM - 9:00 PM VENUE: ISC Office 950 Charter Street, Redwood City, CA 94063 Limited parking on site but plenty of street parking nearby. RSVP DEADLINE: Monday, 19 September 2011 

See you all soon!
