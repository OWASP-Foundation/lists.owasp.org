<PRE>Hi All,
Happy to announce our June month's Hacker Thursday meet. Details below:

Date:- June 7th, 6 pm to 8 pm.
Venue:-  Synopsys Building 2,  Room: 21.104A Von Neumann
                455 N Mary Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94085

Registration Form:- <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/mWVtOanufaRMKwvt1">https://goo.gl/forms/mWVtOanufaRMKwvt1</A>

Description:
In this workshop, we'll write custom Python scripts to automate and augment
penetration testing. Learn the basics of port scanning, crafting custom
packets, and building your own exploits in Python.

Topics covered will include:

&#8226; Creating TCP/UDP/FTP/SSH clients and servers

&#8226; Capturing network packets

&#8226; Custom packet crafting and port scanning

&#8226; Web scraping with urllib2, requests and Beautiful Soup

&#8226; Basic exploit development and antivirus evasion

To get the most out of this class, you should already have some basic
programming experience in Python or a similar programming language like
Ruby. If you have not used Python prior to this workshop, take a look at
Instant Python (<A HREF="http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html">http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html</A>) or Learn
Python in 10 Minutes (<A HREF="https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/">https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/</A>) beforehand
to familiarize yourself with the syntax.

Trainer:
Fletcher Heisler  is Founder of  Hunter2 and White Hat Academy and
Previously RealPython.com. Fletcher has taught Python programming and web
development to hundreds of thousands of students around the world using
practical examples and real-world applications. His latest venture Hunter2
teaches modern appsec to engineering teams through interactive labs.
Developers get hands-on practice exploiting and patching real web apps
written in their tech stack.

Again, please fill the form to confirm registration:
