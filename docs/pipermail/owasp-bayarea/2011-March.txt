Hey all, looking for a speaker for Bay Area Hacker's Association
(a/k/a Bay Area Security Enthusiasts) on Sunday.

If nobody else volunteers, I'll do something on network security,
VPNs, and darknets.

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] BAHA Sunday 2pm: How (PCI &c.) Compliance Gets Made
Message-ID: <20110310202439.GF29117@subspacefield.org>

This month we present:
======================

Bio:

Mr. Dahn is a globally recognized payment security expert. He founded the
Society of Payment Security Professionals and Secure Payments Magazine
devoted to risk management in securing payments. He has assisted forensic
experts and law enforcement understand the underground economy and data
breach risks associated with payment card fraud. He has traveled the world
training PCI qualified security assessors (QSA), merchants, banks, and
payment application vendors on the risks associated with payment card data
theft. Mr. Dahn has a Masters in Information Assurance and is a former
National Board of Directors for the InfraGard Members Alliance.

Title: How Compliance Regulations Get Made: Confessions of a QSA Trainer

Abstract:

Although many people fall under the umbrella of regulatory compliance, few
understand how the sausage gets made.  This presentation leverages over 10
years of experience working in regulated industries and explaining how, why
and when companies should comply.  Though most organizations blindly follow
the strict and literal leaning of each word, this presentation will teach
you the intent behind the rules so that you can know when to break them.
Some rules are strict, some flexible, and some are best addressed using
another method.

The focus will be on the Payment Card Industry but these lessons apply to a
broad set of standards and regulations.  Once you learn to decipher the
intent behind the rules you can better navigate the waters and better align
compliance with your security program.
