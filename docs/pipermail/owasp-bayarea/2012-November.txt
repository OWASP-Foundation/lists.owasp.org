Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Next Bay Area OWASP Chapter meeting
Message-ID: <50A2FB5E.8080607@crazypenguin.com>

Hello!

We are in the process of putting together the next Bay Area OWASP
Chapter meeting. We are looking for a location for December or January.
We would prefer locations that can host up to 100 attendees during an
evening session. We do not require that you cater or provide
refreshments, just a comfortable room for attendees.

The proposed topic is Mobile Security. I am hoping we could get
presentations on secure iOS and Android development (not some generic
mobile threats/malware talk) and a short walkthrough on the OWASP
research, guidance, and tools in this space.

If you have proposed speakers that have experience in these areas,
please email me directly so I can start planning.

Cory

OpenSSH is presently v6.1, and there are a bunch of security issues
addressed between v4.4 and latest
(http://www.openssh.org/security.html). Ideally, you should upgrade to
the latest.

If "they" want a demonstrable exploit to upgrade, its going to be an
uphill task even in the future (if they happen to be your clients).
Running a obsolete version invites compliance risks, and reputation
damage, in addition to the actual security risks.

Oh, and it is unclear which security issue you want an exploit for, so
if you could give more details, maybe there is an exploit available.
:)

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Next meeting planning - status
Message-ID: <50ABEE71.1020902@crazypenguin.com>

Hello!

Please mark off your calendars for January 8th and keep an eye on the
mailing list for the RSVP announcement.

Michael Coates from Mozilla was kind enough to offer Mozilla's San
Francisco office for an evening meeting.

We also have Jesse Burns from iSec Partners lined up to give a talk on
secure Android development. We're still looking for a talk on iOS secure
development practices. Again, we're looking for something technical for
people who look at or write code. Any suggested speakers would be
appreciated.

Ideally, if you work in InfoSec, you should be able to grab one of your
developers that deals with mobile and have them attend with you. We're
going to aim for more talks like this in 2013, as one of OWASP's core
values is to educate the development community - which means targeted
technical talks with actionable guidance for developers or those who
work with developers.
