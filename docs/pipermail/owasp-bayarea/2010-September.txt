BTW, I recall one person saying that CSRF wasn't actually an instance
of the confused deputy problem; I would like to hear the argument
behind that if anyone knows of one.  It sure seems to me that sending
your login cookie to a site you didn't intend to is one.

Interesting claims about worst-case SSL performance, designed with
attention to server-side performance (where you typically don't have
90% spare CPU capacity like on a desktop client).

PS:
What's the status of integration of browser and password safes (keychains)?
Perhaps safari and konqueror already do this... not sure.
Would like some solution for the 100+ web passwords I have.
Something that can securely work for all my clients, without trusting some
central server run by someone else.

I would really like to see his test bench and how he got 60K requests
served by a server... even if those are connect/disconnects it's still
a little much...

I don't really believe the performance drops that bad with SSL. I
think they may have used some library that locks...
