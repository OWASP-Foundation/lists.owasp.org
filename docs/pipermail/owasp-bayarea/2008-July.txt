Folks

The slides have been uploaded onto the OWASP Site (thanks Garrett Gee for
uploading). As I had mentioned at the conference, Tom's slides will be
uploaded after Black Hat. Thanks again for your participation. I have also
added people who were interested in getting on the mailing lists so you
should receive this email.

Have a great Independence Day Weekend!

Best regards,
