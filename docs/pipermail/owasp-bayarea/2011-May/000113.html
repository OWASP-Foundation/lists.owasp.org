This Month We Present:
======================

Dan Kaminsky

On:

Making Trust Scale:  The Realities of Comodo and DNSSEC

The realities of X.509 reached a fever pitch with the recent compromise of a
Comodo SSL reseller. In this talk, I'll discuss how and why X.509, as a
technology, leads to trust networks that do not scale, and how DNSSEC is in
fact the correct technology to replace it.

About Dan:

Dan Kaminsky is an American security researcher. He formerly worked
for Cisco, Avaya, and IOActive, where he was the Director of
Penetration Testing. He is known among computer security experts for
his work on DNS cache poisoning (also known as &quot;The Kaminsky Bug&quot;),
and for showing that the Sony Rootkit had infected at least 568,200
computers and for his talks at the Black Hat Briefings.

On June 16, 2010, Dan was named by ICANN as one of the Trusted
Community Representatives for the DNSSEC root.
