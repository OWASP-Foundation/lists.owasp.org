<PRE>Hi Everyone,

Every year during RSA we organize a WASC luncheon. A place for those interested in webappsec to get together to enjoy some free food &amp; drinks, play pool, and talk Web security with a 100 or so like minded people. Everyone on the &quot;owasp-bayarea&quot; is of course invited. The time and location details are below. Remember Jillian's only hold so many. So if you think you want to come, please make sure to register to get on the guest list.

Regards,

Jeremiah Grossman
