<PRE>Hey all,

We're meeting again, as we do every month, second sunday, 2pm, @
Noisebridge.

<A HREF="http://baha.bitrot.info/">http://baha.bitrot.info/</A>

I don't have a speaker lined up, but should have them for the next few
months, hopefully.  If you know someone who wants to volunteer, put us
in touch.

If nobody steps up, I guess it'll be me again :-/ I'm not sure what
I'll present yet, am taking suggestions.  I don't have time to make a
presentation from scratch, but here's the extant options:

<A HREF="http://www.subspacefield.org/security/">http://www.subspacefield.org/security/</A>

There's also a few others in the works, but I need a couple of people
to show up regularly to make it worth my time to finish them.  Each one
is at least 8 hours of work, often several times that.

If you guys haven't seen this one, it's the most web-relevant, and I can
give it some time at OWASP if you want:

You'll note one of these slides as Figure 2 in Netifira's Flickr
API vulnerability which came out a few months later:

So, it's a Sunday, it's after church and not too late; you don't have
any excuses, please come out.  I've given four presos, usually with
one person showing up, and a few ambient listeners from Noisebridge.
I'm going to invite some speakers in the upcoming months, but if we
don't get any momentum, I'm going to just give up on SF.

Cheers,
T
