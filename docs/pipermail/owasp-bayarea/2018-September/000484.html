<PRE>Hi All,
Happy to announce a OWSAP Hacker Thursdays on 27th Sept. Its a Defcon
Workshop,
Please note its a 3 hour session, we will start session by 5 pm.

Please fill the form to confirm your seat.

Details below:
Registration Form:- <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/yd4VZtmOzoPwxfiG2">https://goo.gl/forms/yd4VZtmOzoPwxfiG2</A>

Topic:- Reverse Engineering Application-Layer Protocols Via PCAP
Date: Thursday, September 27th | 5:00PM - 8:00PM (session starts at 6pm)
Venue: Distil Networks, 115 Sansome Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA
94104

Talk Description:
<A HREF="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-workshops.html#pearson">https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-workshops.html#pearson</A>

Reverse engineering has become an increasingly important element of network
security. The ability to break a system down in order to understand its
base components and how they interact is critical to understanding not just
how the system works, but the ways it can leave your network vulnerable.
This is especially true at the application level, where insecure or poorly
managed applications can leak sensitive data. In this hands-on workshop,
attendees will learn how to reverse engineer real application-layer
protocols. During our time together, we'll start at the surface and do a
deep technical dive into the network traffic of a common remote access
application. Along the way, we'll:

1. Introduce protocol reverse engineering and explain its importance
2. Learn how to discover structured data
3. Determine if data is encoded or encrypted
4. Understand how various protocols interact
5. Uncover secondary communications and information leaks in a hands-on
fashion

All materials and content are freely available at
<A HREF="https://dl.awakesecurity.com/defcon/nw_re_tools/resources.html">https://dl.awakesecurity.com/defcon/nw_re_tools/resources.html</A> and will
remain so.

Prerequisites: Familiarity with a network packet capture and analysis tool
-such as Wireshark - will provide a solid foundation on which to build. In
addition, a basic understanding of lua scripts will be beneficial.

Materials: Students will need a laptop with Wireshark installed and access
to the Internet. An IDE of choice is also recommended.

About the Speaker:
David Pearson
Having used Wireshark ever since it was Ethereal, David has been analyzing
network traffic for well over a decade. He has spent the majority of his
professional career understanding how networks and applications work,
currently as Principal Threat Researcher for Awake Security. David holds
computer security degrees from the Rochester Institute of Technology (BS)
and Carnegie Mellon University (MS).

Again, Please fill the form to confirm your seat.
