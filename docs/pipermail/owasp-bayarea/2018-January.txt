Good morning all,

This year's AppSec Cali <https://2018.appseccalifornia.org/> will be held
January 30-31st in Santa Monica (as always).  It's a great conference with
tons of opportunity to learn about new things, meet with new and old
friends, and spend a little time by the beach in beautiful Southern
California.

For those that haven't registered yet, you can use the code *OWASPBA25OFF*
for 25% off, but the code can only be used 50 times, so sooner is better :).

Hope to see you all there.

Thanks,
 -Travis

Hi All,
I am happy to announce our hands-on meet on 24th January. This is part of workshop which was conducted by Abhay Bhargav at Defcon 25. Please fill the below form to reserve your seat.

Topic:- Application Security Automation with OWASP ZAP 2.7.0

Venue:-? CircleCI 201 Spear Street Suite 12 San Francisco, CA 94105

Form:- https://goo.gl/forms/JcW65EcP0pV6xoxB2
In an age of rapid-release applications, DevOps and small application security teams, the only way application security can scale, is with automation. In this workshop, I will introduce some key automation practices and techniques using Python that students can use in their own application security programs for quick wins. I will be using OWASP ZAP 2.7.0 to demonstrate some of the key application security automation concepts, including Parameterized Security Testing with ZAP 2.7.0 and Custom Scripting with ZAP 2.7.0. The session will be almost entirely hands-on, with very little theory

Materials:
Laptop with 64bit CPU (Mac/Win/*nix) is good with 8GB+ RAM (Host Machine) preferred, and atleast 50GB of free HDD 
more details:- https://github.com/we45/ZAP-Mini-Workshop 

About Speaker:

Abhay is the author of two international publications. ?Secure Java for Web Application Development? and ?PCI Compliance: A Definitive Guide?. Abhay is a builder and breaker of applications, and has authored multiple applications in Django and NodeJS. He is a passionate Pythonista and loves the idea of automation in security. This passion prompted him to author the world?s first hands-on Security in DevOps workshop that has been delivered in multiple locations, and recently as a highly successful workshop at the OWASP AppSecUSA 2016, OWASP AppSecEU 2017 and OWASP Appsec USA 2017.

For those who want to learn about FIDO strong-authentication protocols 
converging around the W3C (soon-to-be) standard.  Its free; and you'll 
be on the leading edge of the FIDO 2.0 curve to eliminate the single 
biggest vulnerability in web-applications: userid/passwords.

If you still think userid/passwords are good enough for you and your 
company, check this out:
