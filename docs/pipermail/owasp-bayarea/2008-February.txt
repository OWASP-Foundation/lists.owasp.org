Your Client-Side Security Sucks. Stop Using It.
Presented by: Kurt Grutzmacher

Abstract: Browser-based security has been used for many years to
'protect' back-end systems from attack or to enhance the user
experience. This should not be your only protection and can even open
your application to business logic flaws that scanning tools can not
detect nor report upon! This talk will show some real world examples
of client-side security and the failures they introduced. Business
logic flaws such as the MacWorld Expo Platinum Pass will be examined
in depth.

Bio: Kurt Grutzmacher has been performing Penetration Testing for a
"very large financial institution" for nearly a decade and recently
moved to a "very large utility company" to start their internal
testing program. For two years in a row he has exposed the methods
required to obtain free Platinum Passes to MacWorld and is hoping
they'll get it right the third time, he's tired of explaining it to
them. Kurt contributes to the Metasploit project occasionally and is
currently working on enhancing the project's support for NTLM in
web-based attacks. He also randomly blogs at 
http://grutztopia.jingojango.net/ -- very randomly.

NTLM attacks and countermeasures.
Presented by: Eric Rachner

Abstract: Eric will demonstrate the NTLM relay attack, in which an 
attacker accesses arbitrary web sites and file shares using the 
credentials of any user who can be lured into visiting the attacker's 
web site. Since NTLM is enabled by default as part of the Windows 
integrated authentication protocol suite, this attack is a potential 
concern in any enterprise where Windows is widely used.  Following the 
demonstration, we will explore the history and mechanics of the attack, 
as well as mitigation options.

Bio: Eric Rachner is a security researcher and lead consultant 
specializing in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment and 
penetrating testing of complex mission critical applications and 
systems.  Mr. Rachner began his career in IT at Microsoft in 1994.  As a 
senior member of Microsoft's Security Team, Eric led several projects 
including application penetration testing, code reviews, design reviews 
and security awareness training for internal application teams 
throughout Microsoft's global IT organization. In 2005, Eric became an 
independent security consultant and researcher providing services to 
large global enterprises in North America and Europe.  Away from the 
office Eric has many hobbies; he also participated as a core member of 
the hacking team that won the prestigious "Capture the Flag" contest at 
Def Con three years in a row.

Thank you to all who came out to Pleasanton on Thursday night. I had a
great time and hope you did too!

I've uploaded my presentation with a few minor modifications to
http://grutz.jingojango.net/presentations/Your%20Client%20Security%20Sucks%20-%20OWASP.pdf
- There's also a sweet QuickTime if you're a sucker for the Keynote
animations. Nothing beats a block of javascript appearing in a burst
of flame. Whoooosh!

See you at the next meeting!

Kurt
