Will you have internet connectivity setup for the event? I work for BofA used to work for Mcafee who bought Scanalert. I've tested sites for over 4 years and very much support this organization. I would love to help and if there it internet connectivity. I can get my work done at the booth while I'm not working the booth. Let me know if this is possible if it is call me and I'm there to help. I would love this opportunity and to get more involved with owasp sf.

Hello every one

 

A couple of people have expressed an interest in having an OWASP meet-up at
RSA. Are you all interested? We could do something on Tuesday evening. It'll
be a no-host type of event since we don't have the budget for this. 

 

Please let me know and depending on the level of interest we can decide. 

 

Thanks!
