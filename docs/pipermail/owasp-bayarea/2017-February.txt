Hi all,

It's that time again!  Please join us for one of our March meetups:

San Francisco March 21st
<https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/238044725/>
San Jose March 22nd
<https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/238044903/>

We're going to have regular meetups in both San Francisco and South Bay /
Peninsula every two months going forward, so we hope to see you at a meetup
soon!

We're also looking for speakers
<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-mHnHhEYm2EJFk0HEq-dt1O70L8EOpDAO6XXC_vlpo9OanQ/viewform>

if you'd like to get involved in either please use the forms to let us know.

We'll announce these meetups more generally in a few days but wanted to
give first priority to OWASP Bay Area members.

Thank you
 -Travis McPeak, OWASP Bay Area Leadership Team
