Hey Everyone,

 

  I just moved to SF from Miami Beach and would like to introduce myself
to the list. My name's Kyle, and I joined the security team at Adobe
last week. Previously, I managed/lead a security team at Citrix Systems
in Fort Lauderdale, FL for six years. My main security interests are
security development lifecycles and security testing. I look forward to
meeting you all sometime in the near future!

 

Thanks,

-Kyle
