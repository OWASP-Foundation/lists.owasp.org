Abstract:

We all have heard about DevSecOps, Shifting Left, Rugged DevOps but there
are no clear examples or frameworks available on how to implement DevSecOps
practices. This workshop will teach you exactly that, tools and techniques
to embed security as part of DevOps pipeline.

We will discuss how unicorns like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Etsy handle
security at scale and what we can learn from them. We start off with the
basics of the DevOps, DevSecOps and move onto advanced concepts such as
Security as Code, Compliance as Code and Infrastructure as code. Each of
these concepts will be backed up with hands-on exercises using DevSecOps
Studio, a free and open source distribution for DevSecOps enthusiasts. By
the end of this workshop, you will have enough tools under your belt, that
you can put them into action right away.

We will also cover how to use static analysis (SAST), Dynamic Analysis
(DAST) and OS hardening as part of the Secure SDLC and how to select
tools/processes which fits your organization best.

Topics covered:
1. Introduction to DevOps and DevSecOps
2. People, Process and Technology aspects of DevSecOps
3. Automating SAST/DAST in Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
environments.
4. Infrastructure as Code, Security as Code and Compliance as Code.
5. Container security (Docker) and orchestration
6. On the fly OS hardening and Compliance using Packer and Ansible.

Prerequisites:
1) Should know basics of Linux and commands ( curl, nmap, ssh, etc.,).
