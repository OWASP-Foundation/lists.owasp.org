Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Holiday OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <000801ccb0eb$6d216510$47642f30$@net>

Hi There, 

 

You may remember that the Bay Area OWASP Chapter is divided into 3
Subchapters, San Francisco, the Peninsula, and the East Bay.  A while back,
a few of you expressed interest in hosting the San Francisco "Holiday" OWASP
meeting in December. Since that time, my position at my former company was
eliminated, and I no longer have access to our email discussions. 

 

Please let me know if you are interested in hosting a "lunch time" Holiday
OWASP at your facility!

 

Thanks, and sorry for the confusion! 

 

--Teresa

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Off topic -- looking for a ZAP consultant
Message-ID: <4EF3C8F9.90208@zezez.com>

Hi all,

Sorry for the office topic post.

I am looking for a consultant in local area (California) who has
experience with ZAP.  I need to find someone for a quick project NOW. 
If you or you know someone who fits the description, please have them
get in touch with me.

Best is they would just call me at 650 216 9561 x2110 and I will fill
them in on the specifics.

I have a web application that needs to be tested quickly and I don't
have the time to do it myself.

Regards,
Ty

P.S.  Hope to meet some of you at the next OWASP SF meeting if my
schedule allows.

Is there a reason as to why a different web intercepting proxy is not
suitable i.e. what is the dependency on ZAP?

Christian,

Thanks for the question.

The application under test must conform to testing for OWASP top 10 for
PCI.  The SQA has indicated that if ZAP is used for the testing, it will
be accepted much easier than if testing is done with some other tool. 
Since there is a time of essence to the project I want to use ZAP.  From
what I have learned in 2 hours of playing with ZAP the system it seems
like a very nice, quick to learn tool. 

But I don't have time to come up to speed on all the ins-and-outs so
looking for someone who uses it on a regular basic to do the testing so
the SQA does not poke me to hard during the interview.

Regards,
ty

Do you mean "QSA" rather than "SQA"?

The relationship to ZAP and the OWASP Top Ten that I know of is
http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/owasp-top-10-tools-and-tactics/#xss

That stated, the PCI SSC have also referenced the
http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/ since v2.0 of their standards in addition
to the OWASP Top Ten.

Owasp is a starting point?

IMHO (and *not* OWASP's) http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/ is a better
starting point as their statistics were sampled from a larger dataset
then the OWASP Top 10 i.e.
http://www.greebo.net/2011/03/18/owasp-podcast-82-authorship-of-owasp-top-10-2007/

FYI I am listed as http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/contributors.html and I
also participated in the review of
http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/owasp-top-ten.  My interest the
citation of ZAP was due to my leadership of
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_PCI_Project
