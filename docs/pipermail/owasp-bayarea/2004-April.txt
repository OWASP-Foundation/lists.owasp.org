Dear all

This is the final reminder for OWASP SV meeting on Aug 25th. Two additional
items:


- Web Streaming - If you can't make it to the event, you can watch the live
stream on http://air.mozilla.org

- Building access - Please make sure that you arrive by 6.30 at the latest
because the doors are locked and we'd like to start at 6.30 and not have
someone man the doors. Food and drinks will be served at 6.00 PM



If you have any questions please let me know. Looking forward to seeing you
there.



Thanks!

Mandeep Khera

Just a reminder to register if you haven't already done so.
