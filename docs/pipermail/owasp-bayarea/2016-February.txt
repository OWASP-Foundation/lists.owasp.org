Message-ID: <D2D571EA.4E9E9%blake@hotwan.com>

Awesome for the help!

???, I am trying to see what?s been done so far -if anything for updating
Top 10 for 2016.

Trying to reach out Dave Wichers, the former project lead of OWASP Top 10
-2013 to see what?s going on.

I have some ideas on representing Web Services and APIs (OAuth, etc) a
little better in the mix as well as augmenting vulnerability prevalence data
to support the new rankings.

Hello, Blake. 

Are you in the development of Top Ten 2016?
What is the time frame?

I will support you with Korean security experts.

Thanks a lot. 
Best regards.

Hi Blake,

Dave answered about the same question like this:

            -------- Forwarded Message --------

    Betreff: 	Re: [Owasp-leaders] New version this year ?
    Datum: 	Sun, 03 Jan 2016 12:50:15 -0500
    Von: 	Dave Wichers <dave.wichers at owasp.org>
    An: 	Sebastien Gioria <sebastien.gioria at owasp.org>, owasp-topten at lists.owasp.org, Owasp leaders
    <owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>



    We are going to start the update effort in a month or two. Not sure if it
    will complete by the end of this year or come out in 2017. My suspicion is
    more likely to be early 2017 as was already announced on the Top 10
    mailing list.

    -Dave

    -------- End of Forwarded Message --------

Kind regards

I need to issue a data call. I plan to do that by end of February and make
it public, whereas previously I simply asked for specific organizations to
contribute. I'm going to provide a template of what the input needs to look
like and then anyone who wants to can contribute there data.

We'll then have to sort through it all and decide what the next Top 10
items are going to be based on this input and other trends we are seeing in
industry.

At that point, it would be good to discuss your ideas around including
other material like you suggest.

Thank you Dave.

Have we incorporated CVE?s in the past?  Not necessarily under the general
category " A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_
Vulnerabilities>  ? but make it more specific as to the type of vulns found
in them. (Jeremy Long?s Dependency Checktool comes to mind.)

Also, I?m hoping we can rope in the bug bounty folks / companies.  Jason
Haddix, a great supporter of OWASP, may give us some guidance.

Furthermore, I?ve worked with a few companies that have internal BB that may
help out.

Each Top 10 item refers to the relevant CVEs if that's what you mean. I
definately plan to reference Dependency Check in the new Top 10.

Not sure how bug bounty programs would relate to the Top 10...

Yes, only relevant CVEs that pertain to top web app stuff. We got several
years of good data on that.

Bug bounty programs have increasing relevance nowadays. Crowdsourced hacking
from all over the world find bugs in people?s websites 24/7/365 and they get
paid either thru an internal program like PayPal's or an external company
like Bug Crowd, Hackerone, etc.

I feel Bug Bounties are more legitimate and representative of a top 10 than
some web app security company submitting their anonymized findings of their
previous assessments.

Bug bounty findings are validated findings hence a tangible payout.

Security company assessments stats are skewed with the inclusion of a bunch
of potential false positives introduced as vulns.  These false positives are
only later discovered by the receiving clients and or other 3rd party
auditors who review the work of the previous Security company assessment.
This delta of error is rarely conveyed back to the security company that
provided the original assessment so their stats.

 Say for example, 

A company may say, "we found 1,000 different cross-site scripting bugs on a
website" when in fact there maybe only 2 after someone else outside the
assessment validated those findings.

Hope this makes sense.

I feel Bug Bounties are more legitimate and representative of a top 10 than some web app security company submitting their anonymized findings of their previous assessments.

Bug bounty findings are validated findings hence a tangible payout.

Security company assessments stats are skewed with the inclusion of a bunch of potential false positives introduced as vulns.  These false positives are only later discovered by the receiving clients and or other 3rd party auditors who review the work of the previous Security company assessment.   This delta of error is rarely conveyed back to the security company that provided the original assessment so their stats.

 Say for example,

A company may say, "we found 1,000 different cross-site scripting bugs on a website" when in fact there maybe only 2 after someone else outside the assessment validated those findings.

Hope this makes sense.

Each Top 10 item refers to the relevant CVEs if that's what you mean. I definately plan to reference Dependency Check in the new Top 10.

Not sure how bug bounty programs would relate to the Top 10...

Also, I?m hoping we can rope in the bug bounty folks / companies.  Jason Haddix, a great supporter of OWASP, may give us some guidance.

I need to issue a data call. I plan to do that by end of February and make it public, whereas previously I simply asked for specific organizations to contribute. I'm going to provide a template of what the input needs to look like and then anyone who wants to can contribute there data.

We'll then have to sort through it all and decide what the next Top 10 items are going to be based on this input and other trends we are seeing in industry.

At that point, it would be good to discuss your ideas around including other material like you suggest.

Well. That depends on who does the assessment and how they vett their
findings. Aspect reports don't contain any false positives, because they
all are found by humans, not just output of tools.

But that said, I think your point is valid. If a BB program wants to submit
their findings to the OWASP Top 10 open call, that would be great.

I like the idea of including BB data.  But remember that BB programs have their own set of biases.  What is a good investment of time for a BB payout  may not match the types of flaws your adversaries go after.

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Fwd: Some tools for FIDO-enabling web-applications

I'm sure most of you have heard of FIDO; if not, you should check it
out (fidoalliance.org).  If you were wondering: are there any FOSS
tools, here is the answer.

Please forward where appropriate.  Thanks.

Hi,

Having built business applications in the past, I know first-hand, how
difficult it can be using new technology to solve problems when there
aren't enough examples and tools available in the ecosystem.

We've made some tools available on the internet, for people new to
FIDO U2F, in the hope that it will ease them into realizing that
FIDO-enabling web applications is not a big deal.

The tools are:

- An open-source FIDO Certified U2F server - you can run it in a VM;
   (https://sourceforge.net/projects/skce);

- A tutorial to FIDO-enable a basic JSP-based, CRUD web-application and
   make it work with the above-mentioned U2F server:

(https://fidodemo.strongauth.com/en-US/StrongKey_CryptoEngine/2.0/html/Fido_Tutorial_for_JSP/index.html)

- A FIDO U2F Token Simulator in software for desktop applications.
   This can be useful in automated testing without the need to have a
   human sitting in front of a PC providing "Test-of-User-Presence"
   proof, or if you don't have a U2F token (in many countries) and
   still want to FIDO-enable a web-app.  However you just can't test
   it through a browser; but it can be useful in environments that
   use tools like Selenium for automated web-app testing):
   (https://sourceforge.net/projects/skce/files/v2-Build124/)

- A FIDO U2F Token Simulator in software for Android (for the same
   reasons mentioned above, and at the same URL).

- A FIDO-enabled web-application you can test immediately if you have
   a FIDO Certified U2F token:
   (https://fidodemo.strongauth.com/skcc - with password 1FA)
   (https://fidodemo.strongauth.com/pno - no password, with CAPTCHA)
   (https://fidodemo.strongauth.com/pnoc - no password, no CAPTCHA)
   (The last example can be useful for intranet web-apps where users
    might already be authenticated on the network through LDAP servers
    or equivalent)

- If you want to download the SKCC web-application and test it on your
   network without going across the internet, its available for download:
   (https://sourceforge.net/projects/skcc).

We hope people will find these useful; if not, let us know how they
can be improved (its all FOSS, so the only thing you have to to lose
is a little time). :-)

Enjoy!
