<PRE>All,

We had a great OWASP Bay Area chapter event last night. Thanks so much to
our speakers and hosts. Info here (
<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/233591691/">https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/233591691/</A>)

As was mentioned at the event, we're looking to better formalize chapter
leadership. Currently our only limitation to holding great events is the
time and availability of volunteers to plan and execute - we are fortunate
to have all other items (great attendee interest, funding for the chapter,
places to host, etc)

Are you interested in volunteering 4 hrs per month to advance the local
OWASP chapter? If so, please add your name to the form below. We are going
to meet in person in 2 weeks here in SF to discuss ideas. I'll send the
details to those that express interest.

*OWASP &quot;Bay Area&quot; / I'm not in SF*
One big item will be to better support all areas of the bay with our
chapter. So, if you want to volunteer and you're in the Bay but not in SF,
please do add your name to the list. We'll follow up after our in person
with an hangouts style meeting for the next discussion.

I also see the future of our Bay Area chapter to have leadership teams from
the different parts of the bay to help schedule and plan events. This will
maximize the ability for people to attend regardless of where they are in
the bay and also keep a strong chapter that can work centrally  to leverage
all our resources.


Thanks!
