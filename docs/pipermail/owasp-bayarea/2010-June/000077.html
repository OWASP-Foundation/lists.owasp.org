<PRE>Hi there,

First off, I was wondering if this group has regular meetings that I could
put on my calendar, or whether I have to monitor the list.  One thing you
might consider is a Google calendar, so that people who happen to use that
can get notified of meetings easily, especially if they're irregular.

Next, I wanted to share some results with you.  I want to start a
blog, and after seeing so many security experts get owned by ZFO, I
wanted something that wasn't riddled with holes.  I started down this
path here:

<A HREF="http://www.subspacefield.org/~travis/static_blog_generators.html">http://www.subspacefield.org/~travis/static_blog_generators.html</A>

The tradeoffs of using static HTML are discussed there, but it's
obviously more secure.  In addition to finding a boatload of static
HTML generators, I found myself having to learn the various markup
languages, template languages, and so on.  It was a surprisingly large
amount of work!  I'm thinking of breaking it out into seperate pages
and doing some feature comparison matrices.

Nevertheless, for those of us who like to share what we've learned, or
gathered, or distilled, being able to do so easily is important.  I
once heard Marilyn vos Savant (highest IQ in the world) say that if
you want a good vocabulary, keep your dictionary in an easy-to-reach
place, preferably open.  If you make it easy, you'll do it more.

1) Does anyone know of any other groups or mailing lists where I can
share information with web authors about tools?

2) Does anyone have an idea on where I can find good local user
groups, or mailing lists, about web app development, particularly in
python?

I'm investigating pythonic web frameworks out there, and I'm a little
overwhelmed with the amount of detail.  I'm also open to Ruby, though
I find it slightly more cryptic, and I suspect that my information
overload would increase an order of magnitude once I started looking
at RoR and other Ruby web app frameworks.

Here's what I've assimilated so far:

<A HREF="http://www.subspacefield.org/~travis/python_web_framework_comparison.html">http://www.subspacefield.org/~travis/python_web_framework_comparison.html</A>

Again, chasing down all those little boxes is turning out to be
very difficult.  Feel free to share that with anyone you know
who might find it useful.

I've found a Bay Area Python Interest Group, and may attend that,
though it conflicts with the DC650 meeting.

Thanks!
Travis
