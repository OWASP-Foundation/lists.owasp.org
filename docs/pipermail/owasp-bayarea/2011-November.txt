Jason Chan - Practical Cloud Security
Over the past several years, there has been much hand wringing and teeth gnashing related to public cloud security. Because of this, many organizations have limited or delayed their cloud usage.
Faced with business and market imperatives that demanded scale and elasticity that traditional data center architectures could not provide, Netflix jumped head first into the public cloud two years ago.  As we continue to mature our environment, we?ve also begun leveraging the benefits of the public cloud to enhance our security posture and capabilities.
This presentation will be a practical examination of Netflix?s approach to cloud security. Topics covered include:
?       Using public cloud automation and APIs to enhance security visibility
?       Netflix?s ?Security Monkey? tool for cloud security monitoring and alerting
?       Inter-host reachability and connectivity analysis for firewall policy evaluation and optimization
?       Netflix?s model-driven architecture for securing and managingsystems and applications
?       Call to action: Cloud Security Gap Analysis and Next Steps
Luca Carettoni - From CVE-2010-0738 to the recent JBoss worm
Being a widely deployed enterprise application server, JBoss has always been a juicy target for attackers. Security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in critical components, such as the infamous JMX-console, can be exploited in order to execute arbitrary code and harm the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the entire system. Our quick journey through JBoss insecurity will start from the analysis of a critical authentication bypass flaw to the recent JBoss worm which affected numerous installations worldwide. This presentation will also cover practical aspects on how to detect misconfigurations and secure your application server.  
David Fifield - Evading censorship with browser-based proxies
Proxy systems like Tor and VPNs can be used to get around Internet censorship and access blocked resources, but what happens when the circumvention system itself is blocked? A flash proxy is a miniature proxy that runs in a web browser, that can be activated just by viewing a web page. Web site visitors provide a large and constantly changing pool of proxy addresses that are difficult to block. Even though each proxy may last only seconds or minutes, it is possible to switch between them in a way that makes web browsing more or less seamless. We will share details of our flash proxy implementation and explain how to add a proxy to your web page.
Abraham Kang - DOM-based XSS and output encoding
An interactive presentation that intends to turn all of the listeners of the presentation into XSS experts and help them understand how to mitigate XSS properly using output encoding.

Message-ID: <55BB5906-D4CB-477B-9309-BC5B401ECD25@crazypenguin.com>

This is a good problem to have? after we announced the room change for the November 30th meeting, we got so many new signups that we outgrew that room, too!

So? without further ado - the new location for the meeting is below. No more changes, I promise!
