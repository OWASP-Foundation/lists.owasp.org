Talk Description:
Attacking &amp; Auditing Docker Containers Using Open Source tools

Session Description :
This is a part of Defcon26 workshop(
<A HREF="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-workshops.html#akula">https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-workshops.html#akula</A>).
Developers and Operations teams (DevOps) have moved towards containers and
modern technologies. Attackers are catching up with these technologies and
finding security flaws in them. In this workshop, we will look at how we
can test for security issues and vulnerabilities in Dockerised environments
. Throughout the workshop we will learn how we can find security
misconfigurations, insecure defaults and container escape techniques to
gain access to host operating system (or) clusters. In the workshop, we
will look at real world scenarios where attackers compromised containers to
gain the access to applications, data and other assets.

Prerequisites: Basic familiarity with Linux and Docker

Materials: A laptop with administrator privileges
10 GB of free Hard Disk Space
Ideally 8 GB of RAM but minimum 4 GB
Laptop should support hardware-based virtualization
If your laptop can run a 64-bit virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox it
should work
Other virtualisation software might work but we will not be able to provide
support for that.
