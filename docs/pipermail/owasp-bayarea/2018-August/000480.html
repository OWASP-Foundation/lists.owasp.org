Talk Description:
The Cloud as we know it is changing. Containers have taken the center stage
as the preferred method of developing and deploying software into
production. As security practitioners, we must adapt to the latest
technologies or be left in the dust.
This workshop is a mix of lecture and labs and focuses on the ins and outs
of building a Kubernetes infrastructure capable of taking containers from a
developer&#8217;s laptop to production, in a secure manner.
The hands-on portion of the workshop will rely on Kubernetes for the
deployment and orchestration of Docker containers. Each student will build
a sandbox Kubernetes cluster from scratch on their local machines using
Goole Kubernetes Engine. We will cover the following topics throughout the
workshop:

    Fast and Furious Introduction to Kubernetes
    Common Kubernetes Security Issues and Remediations
    Kubernetes Authentication and Authorization
    Logging in Kubernetes
    Building an Automated Security Testing Pipeline in Kubernetes

Plenty of time will be left for Q&amp;A and open discussion.

Student Requirements
Familiarity with at least one public cloud provider is recommend. Students
should also have basic Docker knowledge and experience launching and
managing basic cloud instances. Basic command line and scripting skills are
highly recommended. No Kubernetes experience is required.

Laptop Requirements
Any laptop with a modern web browser to access Google Cloud Platform. GCP
credentials will be provided.
