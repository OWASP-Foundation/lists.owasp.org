<PRE>Hi All,
We are happy to announce a OWASP Hacker Thursdays event on 6th September
titled &quot;Microcontrollers and Single Board Computers for Hacking, Fun and
Profit&quot;.
Details below. Please sign on the below form to confirm your seat.

Date: Thursday, September 6th | 5.30:00PM - 8:30PM
Venue: Hackerone, 300 Montgomery Street, 12th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104

Form:- <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/3ayNqvJMHAFxSVh13">https://goo.gl/forms/3ayNqvJMHAFxSVh13</A>

Talk Description:
----------------------------
As security researchers, we are always looking for the next device that
will make our jobs easier and our research more effective. In many cases,
physical gear can be expensive which can be prohibitive, especially in
engagements where dead drops are required. However, with the skyrocketing
popularity of microcontrollers and single board computers, that barrier has
been reduced significantly and has created a host of new possibilities for
everything from dead drops to wired and wireless network intrusion and
analysis.

During the first portion of the workshop, join Matt Torbin as he introduces
some of the more popular options in this genre, including demonstrations of
his case studies. Specifically Matt will demonstrate three devices he built
to solve specific problems and that are based on these platforms: ATtiny85,
ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi. As a bonus, Matt will also demonstrate a simple
technique that uses Applescript and Bash that can be used to create a
simple USB trojan and can be useful for end-user training.

After the presentation, there will be a hands-on exercise using the
ATtiny85 to build the &#8220;Poor Man&#8217;s Rubber Ducky&#8221; which was demo'd this year
in Matt's presentation at DEF CON 26.
*THE FIRST 50 ATTENDEES will be provided with an ATtiny85 kit which they
can program and take home. *Should attendees wish to purchase their own,
they can find the device used here:

Attendee Requirements:
-----------------------------------------
1. Attendees should feel comfortable with basic programming skills.
Knowledge of fundamental programming structures such as variables, loops,
blocks and methods is critical, though a specific language is not.
2. Attendees should have a basic understanding of their respective
operating systems and the underlying command line utility. Specific tasks
during the workshop may include changing directories and editing files.

Hardware/Software Requirements:
---------------------------------------------------------
Attendees must bring a laptop with the following specifications:

1. While there is no specific operating system requirements, a strong
preference should be noted for Unix, Linux and OSX. The presenter and
volunteers will do their best to be operating system agnostic though no
guarantees can be made.
2. Laptop must either have USB-A type sockets or attendees must bring an
adapter. NOTE FOR APPLE USERS: The Apple-branded adapters will not work
with the ATtiny85. Please consider purchasing a third party adapter such as
this which has been tested and proven to work:

3. Laptops must have the Arduino IDE already installed. Attendees can
download this software from the Arduino web site:

About the Speaker:
--------------------------------
Matt Torbin has worked on almost every aspect of the software development
lifecycle. For the majority of his career, he worked as a front-end, full
stack engineer specializing in UI/UX. During this time, he was involved in
development and also testing efforts, which included quality and security
best practices. In the last few years, Matt completed a career transition
to application security engineering, most notably through security
evangelism roles, where he worked closely with development teams. As an
application security engineer, Matt is responsible for security best
practices, which encompasses both digital and physical threat vectors. Most
recently, Matt is the concept creator and team lead for the Day of
Shecurity conference which took place on June 16th in San Francisco, CA. In
his free time, he is passionate about promoting equality in the
cybersecurity industry and offering mentorship to young technologists. His
goal is to leave behind a better industry than the one he found when he
first began his career.
