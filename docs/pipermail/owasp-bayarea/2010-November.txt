Message-ID: <BAY132-W181F924E5565951562B971A8360@phx.gbl>


Greetings,

My company in San Mateo is looking to hire someone to come in and perform a one or two day training session on security coding standards for ASP.NET and C# applications. We'd like to focus on the top OWASP top ten list and the audience would be mid to senior level developers. If you or anyone you know is able to do this, please contact me.

Thank You,
Saul Cacal
