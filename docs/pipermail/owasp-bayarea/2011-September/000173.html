Hi Team,

Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) is inviting the OWASP Peers along with many others in Silicon Valley for our Open House on September 20th @ 6:30 PM - 9:00 PM in our infamous &quot;950 Charter&quot; warehouse. 

The entire ISC Team is physically in town - including our operational security crew building the tools used in the latest take downs. This is an opportunity to have quality time with &quot;Dr.&quot; Paul Vixie (yes, Paul just got his PhD). This would be a excellent time to talk directly to the engineers working on BIND, DHCP, AFTR/PCP, F-Root, the Operational Security work, Security Information Exchange (SIE), and the new Open Source Routing Forum (OSRF). 

Please forward this invitation to others inside your organization. Please share with your colleagues in the industry. Network Engineers, DNS admins, staff maintaining DHCP, and operational security people would all find value through informal whiteboard sessions.  

-&gt; DNS and DHCP operators, this is a good time to talk directly to our super-geeks, whiteboard problems, and see our open source work. 

-&gt; Security people, this is the right time to privately talk to our security people working tools that are used to track and whack the badness. Find out what is really happening on the latest BOTNET take downs and the Conficker work. DNSDB will be demonstrated along with ways security professionals can use it as a tool to protect their site.

-&gt; Network &amp; data center people, we can walk through the new Open Source Routing Forum where we use our experience building code critical to the Internet and invest in Quagga.

Please use this link to register: <A HREF="http://bit.ly/ISCevent092011">http://bit.ly/ISCevent092011</A>

Heavy Hors D'oeuvres are served along with opportunities to win ISC &quot;souvenirs.&quot;

DATE: Tuesday, 20 September 2011 TIME: 6:30 PM - 9:00 PM VENUE: ISC Office 950 Charter Street, Redwood City, CA 94063 Limited parking on site but plenty of street parking nearby. RSVP DEADLINE: Monday, 19 September 2011 

See you all soon!
