Hi Everyone,

I've recently left Lending Club and I'm looking for my next InfoSec
opportunity.  In particular, I'm looking to build an InfoSec program from
the ground up within SF.  Preferably, the company is a startup or has
little to no InfoSec and they're just starting out.

Here's my profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/appsecjonathan/
If you think there might be a fit, feel free to reach out to me

Historically, this list has been used for announcing OWASP related events.
If that has changed, then my apologies to all.

Also, the link submitted requires authentication to LinkedIn and is not
available for anonymous viewing.  Many in the infosec community left
LinkedIn years ago (if not earlier) after revelations of their 'dark
patterns' within marketing practices (
https://medium.com/@danrschlosser/linkedin-dark-patterns-3ae726fe1462#.rp21nw2zd)
and it strikes me that links submitted to this list should not require
authentication to third party sites for viewing.

Within the infosec community, trust can be difficult to regain after it has
been lost and my hope is that we would be both mindful and considerate
about sharing links to sites that may still be in the process of regaining
trust within the infosec community.

As a general rule, there is strength in numbers and the Infosec community
needs to support those within the community that hold sites to a higher
standard than may be required by the broader user community.

Respectfully,

The link that Jonathan posted does not require authentication to view his
profile. For example, if you open it in an incognito/private window, you
will see that you can access his public profile without requiring a login.

Best of luck in your search, Jonathan - there are a lot of good companies
out there hiring. Feel free to ping me off list for a few leads.

Cory

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] April EAST BAY Meetup Announcement.
Message-ID: <CAJfVT2zLHksAbu-cb_OPzUarhq+ybEMvb5ajYyRPB8iuhC-FRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We are very happy to announce our first EAST BAY meetup:

Oakland April 20th <https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/238812844/>

This event will be hosted at Pandora Media Inc which is near the 19th St
BART stop so we hope to see you all there!

We're also looking for speakers and hosts, if you'd like to get involved in
either please use the forms to let us know.

We'll announce this meetup to a larger audience in a few days but wanted to
give first priority to OWASP Bay Area members.

Thank you
 -Aaron Sutter, OWASP Bay Area Leadership Team
