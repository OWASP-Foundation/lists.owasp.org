</I>&gt;<i> are interested in computer and application security.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agenda and Presentations:

</I>&gt;<i> 6:30pm - 7:15pm ... Your Client-Side Security Sucks. Stop Using It. &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> Kurt Grutzmacher
</I>&gt;<i> 7:15pm - 8:00pm ... NTLM attacks and countermeasures - Eric Rachner
</I>&gt;<i> 8:00pm - 8:30pm ... Networking Session
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Venue:
</I>&gt;<i> Robert Half International
</I>&gt;<i> 5720 Stoneridge Dr
</I>&gt;<i> Pleasanton CA 94588
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your Client-Side Security Sucks. Stop Using It.
</I>&gt;<i> Presented by: Kurt Grutzmacher
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract: Browser-based security has been used for many years to
</I>&gt;<i> 'protect' back-end systems from attack or to enhance the user
</I>&gt;<i> experience. This should not be your only protection and can even open
</I>&gt;<i> your application to business logic flaws that scanning tools can not
</I>&gt;<i> detect nor report upon! This talk will show some real world examples
</I>&gt;<i> of client-side security and the failures they introduced. Business
</I>&gt;<i> logic flaws such as the MacWorld Expo Platinum Pass will be examined
</I>&gt;<i> in depth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bio: Kurt Grutzmacher has been performing Penetration Testing for a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;very large financial institution&quot; for nearly a decade and recently
</I>&gt;<i> moved to a &quot;very large utility company&quot; to start their internal
</I>&gt;<i> testing program. For two years in a row he has exposed the methods
</I>&gt;<i> required to obtain free Platinum Passes to MacWorld and is hoping
</I>&gt;<i> they'll get it right the third time, he's tired of explaining it to
</I>&gt;<i> them. Kurt contributes to the Metasploit project occasionally and is
</I>&gt;<i> currently working on enhancing the project's support for NTLM in
</I>&gt;<i> web-based attacks. He also randomly blogs at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://grutztopia.jingojango.net/">http://grutztopia.jingojango.net/</A> -- very randomly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> NTLM attacks and countermeasures.
</I>&gt;<i> Presented by: Eric Rachner
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract: Eric will demonstrate the NTLM relay attack, in which an
</I>&gt;<i> attacker accesses arbitrary web sites and file shares using the
</I>&gt;<i> credentials of any user who can be lured into visiting the attacker's
</I>&gt;<i> web site. Since NTLM is enabled by default as part of the Windows
</I>&gt;<i> integrated authentication protocol suite, this attack is a potential
</I>&gt;<i> concern in any enterprise where Windows is widely used.  Following the
</I>&gt;<i> demonstration, we will explore the history and mechanics of the attack,
</I>&gt;<i> as well as mitigation options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bio: Eric Rachner is a security researcher and lead consultant
</I>&gt;<i> specializing in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment and
</I>&gt;<i> penetrating testing of complex mission critical applications and
</I>&gt;<i> systems.  Mr. Rachner began his career in IT at Microsoft in 1994.  As a
</I>&gt;<i> senior member of Microsoft's Security Team, Eric led several projects
</I>&gt;<i> including application penetration testing, code reviews, design reviews
</I>&gt;<i> and security awareness training for internal application teams
</I>&gt;<i> throughout Microsoft's global IT organization. In 2005, Eric became an
</I>&gt;<i> independent security consultant and researcher providing services to
</I>&gt;<i> large global enterprises in North America and Europe.  Away from the
</I>&gt;<i> office Eric has many hobbies; he also participated as a core member of
</I>&gt;<i> the hacking team that won the prestigious &quot;Capture the Flag&quot; contest at
</I>&gt;<i> Def Con three years in a row.
