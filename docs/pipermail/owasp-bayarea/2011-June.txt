Hello folks,

My company would like to do a partial dry-run of a new class called
'Mobile Hacking' the week of July 7. The class is being taught at Blackhat
in Vegas this year.

We need volunteers to critique parts of the presentation and provide
feedback immediately following the class.

Can the folks at OWASP either in SF or San Jose chapters help me find a
place to teach this dry run. The class is structured for 16 people but
willing to go to 30.

For more info on class, please refer to
http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-11/training/hotwan-mobile.html


Thank you,

Blake Turrentine

Message-ID: <20110603202449.GA373@subspacefield.org>

So after BH/DC that year when everyone got owned in ZFO, I decided to
look at static blog generators (i.e. blog-like, but no webapp to hack,
and obviously no comment system either).

I ended up doing some research and summarizing on these pages, in case
anyone is interested:

http://www.subspacefield.org/~travis/python_web_authoring_programming.html

My original attempt was too ambitious, but is here:

Hello,

Earlier I had sent out an email requesting a hosting location and volunteers
to do some free Dry Runs for a class I am teaching at Blackhat in
Vegas this year. 

The Blackhat class is limited to 16 people, but for the Dry Runs, I want to
limit it to 30.

The Dry Runs involve active participation from volunteers. Refer to
http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-11/training/hotwan-mobile.html in terms
of what equipment to bring to the Dry Runs.

Immediate feedback is required after the Dry Run from volunteers. I will
send out a reminder to those that sign up for a particular dry run before it
happens.

As a volunteer, please pick only 1 of the following dates and email me your
interest as to which one you would like to attend. First come, First serve.
We will try to cover as much of the Agenda below as time permits.

Below is the agenda/ dates /  location / times:

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Workshop on Internet Tracking, Advertising,
 and Privacy:  July 22nd, Stanford University
Message-ID: <4E09BCE8.5000602@cs.stanford.edu>

Friends,

On July 22nd we are running a workshop on Internet Tracking and Privacy 
at Stanford University.   The workshop will discuss Internet privacy 
given the need to track users for targeted advertising or fraud 
prevention.  Confirmed speakers include Ed Felten (FTC chief 
technologist), Dean Hachamovitch (vice president of Internet Explorer), 
and Omar Tawakol (Bluekai).

More information is available at:
	http://seclab.stanford.edu/witap2011/

The workshop is open to the public, but we ask that everyone register to 
help with lunch planning.


Looking forward to seeing everyone there!


Dan Boneh
Stanford University

Message-ID: <185A105A0ACE1F4985AFEC0AB06C732001785EF8@HARLEY.five9.com>

Friends,

 

Raphael Mudge, the creator of Armitage for Metasploit
<http://www.fastandeasyhacking.com/>  is open for travel here in the Bay
Area/Silicon Valley for a workshop/training session.  We just need to
take care of his travel and accommodation.

 

He was at Austin, Texas recently for a similar event.  Below is a quick
review of his workshop:

Let me know if you guys are interested, or if someone can sponsor this
for us, that would be great.

 

Thanks,

Ron

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Quick (less than 5 minute) survey on the OWASP Bay
	Area Chapter
Message-ID: <4E0BAAD5.6010206@crazypenguin.com>

Greetings!

In order to better serve the constituents of the OWASP Bay Area chapter,
we're conducting a very short survey to find out three things:

1. Where you would like to attend local chapter meetings
2. When you would like to attend
3. What topics are of interest

Please take a look and help give us feedback and direction for future
compelling and interesting chapter meetings.

The survey is at http://www.formstack.com/forms/?1092075-fM6F0tu1Ah

Thanks!

Cory Scott
