I'm very interested. I'm still studying and learning. But u would love a
mentor to assess what I've learned and where I want to go to give me well
structured advice.

I'd also enjoy helping those that are completely new. Just because I'm a
rookie doesn't mean I can't reach what I know so far. Let me know

Awesome! Lots of good responses from people. I'll put together a quick google form we can use for mentors and mentees. Full disclosure, we may not kick this off until after appsecusa since bandwidth is a bit limited for the next few days!

But please keep ideas flowing. I'm thinking we could do in person events for this group and also remote sessions for those that might not be in town. This would also be a great path to welcome students into the Owasp Bay Area chapter events.

As you may have heard, Google SpaceX will be taking off next year.  We are
looking for iSec professionals who might interested in out of this world
security (e.g., spacecraft hardware, software, firmware, satellite, data
engine, and anything out of this world security related) to participate.
This will be a great event for students to get involve with space travel
security.

All,

I'm put together a form to accept info from those interested. It would be
good for us to have simple "areas of interest" so we can match mentors and
mentees appropriately.

I want to keep this somewhat brief, what do people think of the following
areas?

Secure Development
Pen Testing / Red Team
Risk Management
Security Compliance
Other

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Looking for an awesome AppSec Engineer at Stanford
	Health Care
Message-ID: <CA+hvp28Tgo5f42aLfUvTPqZaZG1aypfa4kV2Gb2CeraxspJsaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, I figured I'd extend my search (just one time) to this
email distribution.

I'm looking for a Security Engineer with a strong background in Application
Security for my team at Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto. The position can
work out of East Bay as well (Newark) if that commute is easier.
Telecommuting is not an option.

If you daydream about the OWASP Top 10 and want to work in an awesome
Silicon Valley healthcare IT environment, I would really like to hear from
you. 5-7 years experience in this field is the minimum baseline we are
considering candidates at. Soft skills are just as important for this role
as are technical chops, as it will interact heavily with other IT teams and
upper management. We have excellent benefits. And being part of the
Stanford "ecosystem" of organizations, there are other unique benefits you
won't find elsewhere.

The job title will almost likely change to an engineer title (versus
Architect), but most of what I'm interviewing for can be reviewed in this
req: http://www.stanfordhealthcarecareers.com/job/job_info/28675/E

Please feel free to forward this to connections that may be able to
recommend solid candidates as well. Have them contact me directly.
Realistically you must already be local to the Bay Area to be fast-tracked
into consideration for the position.

Thanks!
Noah Chamberlain
