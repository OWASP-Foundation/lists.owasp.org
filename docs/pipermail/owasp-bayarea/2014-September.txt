OWASP Bay Area,

The OWASP Bay Area chapter will be holding a few social events in coming
months. I'm looking for sponsors that may be interested in helping sponsor
these events.

Please send me an email if you are interested in discussing more.


Thanks,

I would sponsor but I don?t think our office has the high ceilings that you?d want.  Arxan could probably rent a space nearby (we?re at 575 Market Street).
