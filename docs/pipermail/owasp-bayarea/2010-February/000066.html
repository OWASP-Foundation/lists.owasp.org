Detailed Abstracts and Speaker Bios


WebBlaze: New Techniques and Tools for Web Security 
I will present the WebBlaze project, aiming at designing and developing new
techniques and tools to improve web security. WebBlaze's new technologies
cover a broad range including new architectural solutions for defending
against cross-site scripting attacks, tools for detecting and defending
against cross-origin JavaScript capability leaks which lead to universal
cross-site scripting attacks, and new approaches for secure  browser
extensions and web advertisements. 


In this talk, I will focus on two sample techniques in WebBlaze: (1) dynamic
analysis and symbolic reasoning of JavaScript to detect client-side input
validation vulnerabilities; (2) program binary analysis to extract
security-related models from browsers to detect new classes of
vulnerabilities such as content-sniffing vulnerabilities. Our techniques and
tools have discovered previously unknown vulnerabilities in browsers and
popular web applications. Some of the solutions in WebBlaze have been
adopted by mainstream browsers and industry standards and deployed on
millions of machines. 


Bio - Prof. Dawn Song
Dawn Song is an Associate Professor in the department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley. She
obtained her B.S. in Physics from Tsinghua University in China in 1996, her
M.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999, and her
Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2002. Prior to joining UC
Berkeley, she was an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University from
2002 to 2007.


Her research interest lies in security and privacy issues in computer
systems and networks, including areas ranging from software security,
networking security, database security, distributed systems security, to
applied cryptography.  She is the recipient of various awards including the
NSF CAREER Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship Award, the IBM
Faculty Award, the George Tallman Ladd Research Award, the Okawa Foundation
Research Award, and the Li Ka Shing Foundation


Women in Science Distinguished Lecture Series Award. She is also the author
of multiple award papers in top security conferences, including the Best
Paper Award at the USENIX Security Symposium and the Highest Ranked Paper
Award at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.  Recently she was
awarded the MIT Technology Review TR-35 Award, recognizing her as one of the
world's top innovators under the age of 35.


State of the Art: Automated Black-Box Web app testing 

Black-box web application vulnerability scanners are automated tools that
probe web applications for security vulnerabilities. In order to assess the
current state of the art, we obtained access to eight leading tools and
carried out a study of: (i) the class of vulnerabilities tested by these
scanners, (ii) their effectiveness against target vulnerabilities, and (iii)
the relevance of the target vulnerabilities to vulnerabilities found in the
wild. To conduct our study we used a custom web application vulnerable to
known and projected vulnerabilities, and previous versions of widely used
web applications containing known vulnerabilities. Our results show the
promise and effectiveness of automated tools, as a group, and also some
limitations. In particular, &quot;stored&quot; forms of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and
SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerabilities are not currently found by many tools.
Because our goal is to assess the potential of future research, not to
evaluate specific vendors, we will not report comparative data or make any
recommendations about purchase of specific tools.

Bio - Prof. John Mitchell
John Mitchell is the Mary and Gordon Crary Family Professor in the Stanford
Computer Science Department. His research in computer security focuses on
web security, network security, privacy, and distributed authorization
management. He has also worked on programming language analysis and design,
formal methods, and applications of mathematical logic to computer science.
Prof. Mitchell currently leads research projects funded by the US Air Force,
the Office of Naval Research, private companies and foundations, and he is
the Stanford Principal Investigator of the multidisciplinary TRUST NSF
Science and Technology Center. He is a consultant and advisor to a number of
companies and is the author of over 140 research articles and two books.


Controlling Data in the Cloud: Outsourcing Computation without Outsourcing
Control
Cloud computing is clearly one of today's most enticing technology areas.
However, despite the surge in activity and interest, there are significant,
persistent concerns about cloud computing that are impeding momentum and
will eventually compromise the vision of cloud computing as a new IT
procurement model. In this survey talk, we characterize the problems and
their impact on adoption. In addition, we describe some existing research
thrusts with the potential to alleviate some of the concerns impeding
adoption.


Bio - Richard Chow
Richard Chow works in the security and privacy group at the Palo Alto
Research Center. Richard is interested in systems security, fraud detection,
and privacy. Some of his achievements include architecting Yahoo!'s
click-fraud protection system and the security and DRM components for
Motorola's first Java-based phone platform. He has played a lead role at
three startups and was also a founder of Trusted Systems Laboratories, which
brought high-assurance security systems to the commercial market. Richard
received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from UCLA.
