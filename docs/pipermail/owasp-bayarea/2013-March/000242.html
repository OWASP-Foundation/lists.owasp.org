<PRE>It's up! Please RSVP at <A HREF="http://owaspbayareaapr2013.eventbrite.com/">http://owaspbayareaapr2013.eventbrite.com/</A>

Thanks to Kevin Babcock @ Box for hosting.

Join us for an evening about secure development practices for deploying
applications in the cloud.

Agenda:

6:00 - Social Half-Hour

6:30 - Welcome &amp; Overview of OWASP Projects, Cory Scott &amp; Guests

6:45 - Building Security from Scratch in the Cloud, Alex Stamos

*Abstract*

Ask any two cloud &quot;experts&quot; about whether you can trust cloud providers for
running your security sensitive systems and you'll likely get three
opinions. When our group of security experts turned to the task of building
a robust, reliable, and secure infrastructure, we chose to disregard the
conventional wisdom, ignore the FUD, and design controls that allow us to
confidently build on AWS, Salesforce, and other cloud providers.

This talk walks you through the steps necessary to build a trustworthy
cloud infrastructure. We outline how you can deconstruct your security
needs into specific technical goals, map those goals onto controls that are
available in the cloud, and discuss what risks need to be accepted while
others are mitigated. The talk includes detailed discussion of
cryptographic, network and logical controls, and is best enjoyed by those
with advanced knowledge of cloud platforms.

*Bio*

Alex Stamos is the CTO of Artemis, the division of NCC Group that is
building the .secure gTLD.  He was the co-founder of iSEC Partners, one of
the world's premier security consultancies and also a part of NCC Group.
 He is a frequently requested speaker at conferences such as Black Hat,
RSA, Defcon, Amazon ZonCon, Microsoft Blue Hat, FS-ISAC and Infragard.  He
holds a BSEE from the University of California, Berkeley.
