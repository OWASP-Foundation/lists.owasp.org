Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Bay Area Hacker's Meeting Sunday 2pm
Message-ID: <20110103230813.GK4127@subspacefield.org>

Hey all,

We're meeting again, as we do every month, second sunday, 2pm, @
Noisebridge.

http://baha.bitrot.info/

I don't have a speaker lined up, but should have them for the next few
months, hopefully.  If you know someone who wants to volunteer, put us
in touch.

If nobody steps up, I guess it'll be me again :-/ I'm not sure what
I'll present yet, am taking suggestions.  I don't have time to make a
presentation from scratch, but here's the extant options:

http://www.subspacefield.org/security/

There's also a few others in the works, but I need a couple of people
to show up regularly to make it worth my time to finish them.  Each one
is at least 8 hours of work, often several times that.

If you guys haven't seen this one, it's the most web-relevant, and I can
give it some time at OWASP if you want:

http://www.subspacefield.org/security/web_20_crypto/

You'll note one of these slides as Figure 2 in Netifira's Flickr
API vulnerability which came out a few months later:

http://netifera.com/research/flickr_api_signature_forgery.pdf

So, it's a Sunday, it's after church and not too late; you don't have
any excuses, please come out.  I've given four presos, usually with
one person showing up, and a few ambient listeners from Noisebridge.
I'm going to invite some speakers in the upcoming months, but if we
don't get any momentum, I'm going to just give up on SF.

Cheers,
T

(Sorry if this gets double-posted, I sent to list from wrong local-part)

Baysec meets that evening as well.

Speaking of that time frame... BAHA announcement relevant to web security:

==========================================================================

So last month's meeting was a success, thanks to those who showed up.

Our website and google calendar are here: http://baha.bitrot.info/

On 13 Feb 2011, 1400 (that's 2pm for the subtraction-impaired),
The Bay Area Hackers Association will host the following talk:

Counter-Exploitation: Pwning Botmasters

We'll have Billy Rios talking about exploiting the ZeuS botnets and
the people who control them.

Zeus is a Trojan horse that steals banking information by keystroke
logging. Zeus is spread mainly through drive-by downloads and phishing
schemes. First identified in July 2007 when it was used to steal
information from the United States Department of Transportation, it
became more widespread in March 2009. In June 2009, security company
Prevx discovered that Zeus had compromised over 74,000 FTP accounts on
websites of such companies as the Bank of America, NASA, Monster, ABC,
Oracle, Cisco, Amazon, and BusinessWeek.

Zeus' current botnet is estimated to include millions of compromised
computers (around 3.6 million in the United States).  As of October
28, 2009 Zeus has sent out over 1.5 million phishing messages on
Facebook. On November 3, 2009 a British couple were arrested for
allegedly using Zeus to steal personal data.

His blog is here:

http://xs-sniper.com/blog/

About the Speaker:

Billy Rios is currently a security researcher for Google where he
studies emerging security threats and technologies.  Before Google,
Billy was a Security Program Manager at Microsoft where he helped
secure several high profile software projects including Internet
Explorer.  Prior to his roles at Google and Microsoft, Billy was a
penetration tester, making his living by outsmarting security teams,
bypassing security measures, and demonstrating the business risk of
security exposures to executives and organizational decision makers.

Before his life as a penetration tester, Billy worked as an
Information Assurance Analyst for the Defense Information Systems
Agency (DISA). While at DISA, Billy helped protect Department of
Defense (DoD) information systems by performing network intrusion
detection, vulnerability analysis, incident handling, and formal
incident reporting on security related events involving DoD
information systems.  Before attacking and defending information
systems, Billy was an active duty Officer in the United States Marine
Corps.

One of the ideas for the Summit is to 'launch' the Summit's proceedings (and
conclusions) at the RSA conference.

There is a lot of thinking and planning that needs to be done in order to
make this happen, so if are going to RSA (or want to be involved in the
proceedings part of the Summit) please add your name to
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011/Summit_Proceedings_-_RSA (and
start populating that page with what needs to be done).

Thanks

So, I'm not really sure who to ask, but maybe you guys have an idea on

The sysadmins noticed email from www-data leaving a machine to a .cn

So, I'm kinda puzzled, this looks like Unicode, or shellcode, but the
BT reference is kinda weird; is a BT tracker serving a torrent aiming
clients at this host?

One outbound email occurs on 30 Jan 2011 at 21:30, and here's the last
entry from around that time:

213.168.53.184 - - [30/Jan/2011:21:21:47 -0800] "8G\x89\x9dg\xd8\xe1o\x99>\x94B\x8cb\xdd8\x9d\x89\x87\x17,\xb8x\x9aA6Y\xc9\xd3\x95\x7f'MSY\xb0\xe1?rw\xac\x83\xc7\x84\x9fY\xaaMY\xdf\x13\xbd;\x82\x87h\x15\x11\x95\x1a\xcc[\xd3\xb6\xba\xf7\xda\xff\x8d\xbe\xbf\x17\x8eM\xd6\xd6K_\xc5\x94\x11\xff>\xe3\x8f\x14\xbb\x88\xa7\xe3~\xa0\xad\xda\xf4|\xf6\x94((\vQ\x85,\xb3c*\x0c\x91\xf8'0\x83<\x85\xacs<\xae\xe1\xfd\xcb4\xc46\x97\xc8,+\xf1T6B\xdac\xf5=\x8d\x02\xce\x85)\xfe\bf\x84\xb4\xd9\xc0c\xbb\xbd.\xef\x82d\x86J\x91\xb2;\xe5\xe8}\xbfKs\xfd\xd8u\xcb]\x9e\xcaf\x04N\x1a\xde\x0e}\x99\xcb\xac\x88M\x10\x0f\x98\xa1\xc1\xd3\x87\xa9QF\xf5\xc4C\xcd9\x0f+\xd7\xd9\x91\xdc'\xab\xba5)S" 400 519 "-" "-"

So, the thing that's kinda puzzling me is, why is it getting 400
responses?  These can't be real URLs, right?  The root of this vhost
is basically empty, just an index.html.

Side notes:

libapache2-mod-php5, php5, libapache-mod-security installed.

PS:

Is there a handy guide from OWASP for investigating web intrusions?
They're the bulk of modern intrusions, and yet I haven't ever really
come across a guide for investigating things like this.
