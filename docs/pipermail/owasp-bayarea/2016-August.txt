Agenda

? 6:30 Doors Open
? 6:45 - 7:30 Talk 1
Ron Hamilton, Performance Technology Partners (PTP)

Malicious actors are probing your web applications every day looking for
vulnerabilities.  Are you performing similar tests yourself? This
presentation will introduce attendees to methods for testing applications
in regard to a number of vulnerabilities outside the basic OWASP Top 10.
The topics to be discussed will include, logic problems, harvesting, and
other examples beyond the OWASP Top 10



? 7:45 - 8:30 Talk 2
Luca Carettoni, LinkedIn Defending against Java Deserialization
Vulnerabilities

Java deserialization vulnerabilities have recently gained popularity due to
a renewed interest from the security community. Despite being publicly
discussed for several years, a significant number of Java based products
are still affected. Whenever untrusted data is used within deserialization
methods, an attacker can abuse this simple design anti-pattern to
compromise your application. After a quick introduction of the problem,
this talk will focus on discovering and defending against deserialization
vulnerabilities. I will present a collection of techniques for mitigating
attacks when turning off object serialization is not an option, and we will
discuss practical recommendations that developers can use to help prevent
these attacks.

? 8:30+ Networking
? 9 Doors Close


Pizza and drinks will be served.
