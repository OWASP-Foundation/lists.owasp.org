Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Bay Area Security Presentations
Message-ID: <20120515235744.GB21788@subspacefield.org>

http://basp.bitrot.info/

This mailing list is to match Bay Area Security organizations (computer, network, information, physical) with security presenters.

My goal for this list is to:

        Reduce the amount of work in organizing a security meet-up
        Allow for presenters to get more exposure on their talks

Cheers
