Bay Area OWASP'ers

I setup a linkedin group for OWASP Bay Area. First, don't worry, you don't
have a new place to check for updates. All of our chapter events will be on
the owasp wiki page as normal.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bay_Area

However, I've noticed that linkedin groups attract a new group of people
that may not be aware of OWASP or our local events. Hopefully this group
will attract additional interest for our events.

Take a look and join - or better yet recommend someone new to join.
