OWASP Bay Area,

I've greatly enjoyed my time at the helm of the OWASP Bay Area Chapter. The
chapter has thrived with many great local events throughout the bay area.
We even were host to the biggest OWASP AppSecUSA ever here in San Francisco
just 2 years ago.

It's been a great ride and I've thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you.

I'm happy to announce that I'm passing the chapter leadership torch to
Travis McPeak. If you've attended an OWASP meeting in the last several
months, it happened because he organized it.

He's got great energy and many awesome ideas. I'll still stay on as a
member of the chapter leadership, but the proverbial ball is now in
Travis's hands.

Please join me in a warm welcome for Travis as the OWASP Bay Area Chapter
Leader!

Hey Michael,

Thank you for the kind words and for everything you've done to get our
chapter into such great shape!

Thanks!
