Message-ID: <CAEjw8timwNR+uJxhzP4_DjhPTde7AVj_gGx9ND+d_+jJMrJ93g@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon folks,

We've just released v1 of the Humanitarian Hack Box, a VirtualBox VM that
comes pre-loaded with a number of humanitarian-centric web applications
(Ushahidi, Sahana Eden, and OpenStreetMap).  The image is designed to
enable testing by security professionals interested in finding and fixing
vulnerabilities in these programs.

The VM image and documentation are available here:
https://docs.google.com/a/roguegenius.com/folder/d/0B-QB7rXOd9AudzYtWm1pRG1GaHc/edit

Updates on the HHB will be posted here:  http://roguegenius.com/hhb

Any bugs that you do find can be submitted for a chance to win $20,000 from
the Access Innovation Prize:  https://accessnow.org/prize

If you have any specific questions please feel free to email me directly.
