Yep. Now that appsecusa is complete this will be the next area of focus. I've got some ideas I'm ironing out and will provide more info soon. Thanks!

Back before I had connections, I wrote this book to try and capture
everything I knew:

http://www.subspacefield.org/security/security_concepts.html

Now that I have no time, and the book lags woefully, but I think it's
a good starting point.

Also, please note that I am looking to find co-organizers for BAHA
(baha.bitrot.info) since I seem to not have time to find speakers or
attend.  You don't have to know much about security, just be reliably
available on the meeting days and possibly willing to help locate
speakers.

You could easily just turn it into a tutoring session if there's no
speaker available.

Hi folks, 
     I know most of us are aware of the problems with redirects and the partial solution in HSTS.

      I am taking an ad hoc survey to see if I can figure out if any high-profile websites or web-based tools are avoiding using a port 80 listener and just expect users to connect on port 443 using the TLS protocol.
      I believe that that is a very small list :-) . Fortify is the only product I know of on that list I am sure there are at least a couple more.

There's really no advantage to not having a port 80 listener, is there?

It depends on your threat model.

The net-net is:

You and your customers can't accidentally end up using HTTP instead of
HTTPS.

The details are:

That means cookies which you failed to set the "secure" (?!?) flag on
don't accidentally get sent via HTTP.

They don't accidentally send a password or sensitive information over
HTTP via an "unsecure" form, possibly via a redirect or something
where the form action is autogenerated.

You can avoid accidentally sending a login cookie or something in
an unencrypted response.

An active MITM can spoof HTTP/TCP/80 without talking to the real site,
clearly.

A MOTS can only race against the real site which probably sends back a
TCP RST.

Passive attackers are SOL if you don't ever do HTTP/TCP/80.

You can easily splice into HTTP requests via dsniff and whatnot
to insert a fake HSTS - it's harder if they never use HTTP in the
first place and you never allow it.

There's probably a dozen other minor implications and scenarios that
would need to be run through to generate a proper analysis, including
interactions with user controllable content, XSS, CSRF, header
splicing and header injection, but this is all you get for free from
me after 2200 on a worknight. :-)

I suppose I didn't consider "accidentally" using HTTP.  Given that I was
considering any mechanism that does not protect against a MITM as flawed, I
still see no benefit, but I do suppose there is a benefit against e.g., the
passive attacker.  Not serving on port 80 does come with a usability cost
though.  Many users will not type in the protocol and will be surprised
when it doesn't work.

Some of the concerns you listed could be mitigated by a well-designed
framework: redirecting all requests to HTTPS won't protect against the data
sent by the user, but it can prevent sending the login cookie in the
response, and your framework can ensure the secure attribute is set on
cookies.

I?ve seen HTTPS everywhere break a few sites, unfortunately.  Some ASF pages come to mind. When mentioned to them, they[1] thought I was a little silly for expecting a website on port 443 to have the same content as one on port 80

John
1:  ?They? being ASF Infra, before the reorg, so might be different now...

Thanks for the discussion folks. I wasn't really asking why, just whether.


The truth is, today, if a web portal doesn't turn off port 80 it can't be secure from being forced to non-TLS traffic.


Yes, people are very used to typing "chase" into their browser and ending up with the chase banking web site. Unfortunately If you're not using the chrome white list or a browser extension, you're not getting automatically sent to https- you get redirected first.


Smart attackers use ettercap and sslsniff to blow through all of that redirection stuff.

Thank you Moxie. Here are the problems with a port 80 redirect:


-Connect to web site using http. Because you didn't use https, the certificate was not verified and you don't really know who you're connected to.

-Receive 301 to redirect BACK to port 80 (kind of like spinning the player in pin the tail on the donkey), but this is attacker code. And you're redirected right back to insecurity

-SSLSNIFF proxies all the network traffic to your bank establishing a secure connection on your behalf, but serving/repurposing back all of the goodies to you on port 80.

-SSLSNIFF puts a little lock FAVICON on the page for good measure :):):)

-Surf away to your bank. You won't even notice it's not the actual bank site. Passwords, account numbers, etc are all in the clear.

     A Browsers' visual cues that you're on a secure site are notoriously unnoticeable. To make this really stand out, we'd have to serve every http:// site with flashing red all around the page. We're not going to be doing that any time soon. HSTS is the best we have, except turning off "port 80" completely.


-----------


So actually, I am not working on a web site. I'm working on software that should be secured as installed anywhere, and it's usually internal. So:


   -Google https whitelist

   -https everywhere whitelist


are out of the question, which leaves:


-HSTS. Great technology... not secure the first time unless you avoid the redirect... and ONLY WORKS WITH SIGNED CERTIFICATES.

So HSTS is imperfect and won't work in many internal deployments.


So back to the original question: Are there any software products you know of that simply disallow redirects and only listen on 443?

It depends on your threat model.

The net-net is:

You and your customers can't accidentally end up using HTTP instead of
HTTPS.

The details are:

That means cookies which you failed to set the "secure" (?!?) flag on
don't accidentally get sent via HTTP.

They don't accidentally send a password or sensitive information over
HTTP via an "unsecure" form, possibly via a redirect or something
where the form action is autogenerated.

You can avoid accidentally sending a login cookie or something in
an unencrypted response.

An active MITM can spoof HTTP/TCP/80 without talking to the real site,
clearly.

A MOTS can only race against the real site which probably sends back a
TCP RST.

Passive attackers are SOL if you don't ever do HTTP/TCP/80.

You can easily splice into HTTP requests via dsniff and whatnot
to insert a fake HSTS - it's harder if they never use HTTP in the
first place and you never allow it.

There's probably a dozen other minor implications and scenarios that
would need to be run through to generate a proper analysis, including
interactions with user controllable content, XSS, CSRF, header
splicing and header injection, but this is all you get for free from
me after 2200 on a worknight. :-)

I suppose I didn't consider "accidentally" using HTTP.  Given that I was considering any mechanism that does not protect against a MITM as flawed, I still see no benefit, but I do suppose there is a benefit against e.g., the passive attacker.  Not serving on port 80 does come with a usability cost though.  Many users will not type in the protocol and will be surprised when it doesn't work.

Some of the concerns you listed could be mitigated by a well-designed framework: redirecting all requests to HTTPS won't protect against the data sent by the user, but it can prevent sending the login cookie in the response, and your framework can ensure the secure attribute is set on cookies.


Cheers

No need to 301 you if there's a MITM.

Well, in the case of chrome, that's not completely true.  Though no
definitive timeline has been laid out, Chrome has stated they intend to
mark HTTP as insecure:

If you're building your product, why does it matter if other products do
this?  If your threat model needs to be protected against HTTP downgrade,
just serve on 443, but realize that if a user *doesn't* type the https (due
to laziness, human error, etc.), a MITM will *still* own them.

Are you sure? Check at least Chrome, FireFox and Safari in OSX in 
default settings. Most search engines prioritize https://www.chase.com 
when you just type "chase" into the browser directly. I can send 
screenshots if you want.

This is not true from what I see. Most folks just typing "chase" into 
their browser (at least chrome, safari and firefox osx) will trigger a 
search engine hit, which mostly list https links by default if available.

So unless the user explicitly types in "http://somesite.com" and that 
site is not preloaded HSTS and (and the user did not trigger HSTS 
headers in previous hits) most browsers default to HTTPS.

Fair?

I was thinking of the (at least somewhat common) case of typing "chase.com",
(i.e., doamin without protocol) which gets you HTTP by default.  For an
internal service as Greg described, people may just type "internal.host.name",
in which case a MITM owns them, no matter what he does on the service.
 (Modulo HSTS.)

Also, if your internal service is not using CA-signed (whether your own CA
or a public CA) certificates, you're also failing already.

"So unless the user explicitly types in "http://somesite.com"<http://somesite.com/> and that site is not preloaded HSTS and (and the user did not trigger HSTS headers in previous hits) most browsers default to HTTPS.?

+1 and fair, imho.

It would be very good if browsers have changed to defaulting to https:// on hostnames before trying http. I was not aware that was the case. If it were true, it would almost negate the need for HSTS.

As some colleagues have pointed out-

    Trying https:// then going to http:// on failure would not be great either, unless HSTS is enabled.

      With this behavior, anyone on "local network" could easily cause a browser to "downgrade" to port 80 by blocking 443. Once HSTS is prevalent, that might be acceptable... but not today.


    (Similar to revocation server attacks, simple ability to block the connection breaks the security of the feature)

I agree. HTTPS/HSTS/Preload are very important pieces of a secure website.

I have another question related enforcing browser clients to use HTTPS:
What if you enforced the use of TLS v1.2 on all web servers to ensure that heartbleed, etc. would not be an issue.
Most browsers have updates to support TLS v1.2, but what about those still on TLS v1.1,1.0?
There is no clean error message from the web server for a failed TLS/SSL negotiation. ? "Secure Connection Failed" Firefox, blank in some others.
There is no HTTP response either. ? ? How to notify users that they should upgrade their browers?

I agree. HTTPS/HSTS/Preload are very important pieces of a secure website.

This is a very difficult problem to solve in my understanding.


If lower protocol support is not offered, there is no way to warn. Participating in any network discussion on the lower protocol (even to post an error message) leaves open at least a social engineering attack.


I believe the google and firefox teams ran into similar issues when trying to secure their download servers; they can comment with the full story.


Basically, they were in the process of turning off SSLV3 on the servers when they realized that if someone running older software or non-chrome/firefox browsers wanted to download a newer more secure browser... they had just blocked their avenue to do so. So SSLV3 may still be turned on for those download sites at the moment.


A partial solution to this problem is the use of the SCSV (Signalling Cipher Suite Value) cipher suite to signal that newer versions of TLS are available... Perhaps while providing SSL or TLS 1.0.

      This cipher suite is an ingenious invention to bridge the gap between the older and newer protocols:


-Old browsers connect on the old protocol because that's all they know how to do. They work.

-Newer browsers Connect on the newer protocols such as TLS V1.2. Everything works fine.

-If a network attacker attempts to force you down to the older protocol (SSLV3 in this case), when the secure negotiation happens for listing cipher suites.... The presence of this simple semaphore (it's not really a "cipher suite" but a signal) let's the client browser know: "pssst. I actually support a higher protocol than SSLV3. If you are seeing me... you're probably being attacked.)

https://alpacapowered.wordpress.com/2014/10/20/ssl-poodle-attack-what-is-this-scsv-thingy/ and

http://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-bmoeller-tls-downgrade-scsv-02.txt discuss this in more detail.

Message-ID: <56277567.7090608@owasp.org>

If you want to warn on the use of an old SSL protocol without having to 
actually support it, there are ways to pull that off. You can serve 
icons from different subdomains, each configured to support only a 
single protocol.  From the main site (running only ?secure? protocols), 
javascript can try to load a 1x1 image from each address.  Based on the 
errors from each request, it?s possible to detect & warn about a 
particular protocol without serving anything of importance on it.

Bay Area OWASP,

I hope you all attended and enjoyed AppSecUSA! It was a great event with a
ton of people. Now that we've completed that (and taken a few weeks to
recover), we're going to ramp up our local events.

Next item coming will be the kickoff for the Mentorship program. I'm
finalizing a regular location in SF for this and will send a note when
we've got that locked in. Preliminary kick off is Monday, November 30th.
More details to come. Add your name here if interested -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bay_Area#Mentorship_Program


Are you interested in being a core chapter contributor?
Want to help the chapter hold amazing events? We need your help. Add your
name here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/157phlqeh00WoUiryCXZ9iKohnecQ1F1nHjWi0M03D1o/edit?usp=sharing

Have an idea for an event? Send it back to the thread. We're of course
going to have chapter events with speakers. But we could also do more
social/networking events, hack-a-thons, or other ideas. Very interested to
hear ideas!

I formatted the sheet and added some more content.

I think if everyone puts in the ideas in there and folks take up these
ideas, we can have a great year.
