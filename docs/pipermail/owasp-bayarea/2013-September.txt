Bay Area OWASP'ers

We're experimenting with a new item for OWASP. In addition to our regularly
scheduled quarterly briefings we're also going to try periodic social
gatherings.

The purpose of the OWASP social gathering is:
- informal security chat - the benefits of "hallway con" and security talk
with others in the industry
- networking - meet other people in the field and industry
- a nice break after a long work day

The idea is to hold these events in central areas where people can easily
stop in for a drink immediately following their work day. We will also look
for company sponsors that can either host space for the gathering, provide
food/drinks, or both.

Note: These events won't have any presentations. They're meant to be social
gatherings to meet others in the industry and chat about security.

I'll send a separate email shortly with info on our first social hour that
will take place on Wednesday 9/25/13 in Mountain View.


Thanks!

I had a great time.  It was nice meeting you, and now I know that 25% of
Google's traffic is coming from Firefox.  Looking forward to the next
meeting.  Give me a yell if you need a hand setting things up.
