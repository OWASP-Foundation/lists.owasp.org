upgraded venues to City View at Metreon.

Description:
We live in cloud first era where the cloud is increasingly our first choice
of deployment due
to its convenience and scalability.

Monitoring for attacks and defending against them in real-time is crucial
but defending your
cloud infrastructure during attacks can prove to be a nightmare even with
the solutions
currently available in the market.

In this workshop, we will look at how to defend your cloud infrastructure
using Serverless
and elastic stack.

1. We will see how we can implement basic alerting every time an SSH
connection is
successful to a host inside AWS VPC
2.  Build a simple dashboard to see the audit trail of authentication
against a CMS
3.  Automated remediation of a security policy violation

While you can expect to do hands-on, some of these will be demos with code
and
documentation shared as part of the workshop.

1. Introduction to Automated Defence
2. Why do this instead of <insert favourite security tool>
3. Core concepts at play
4. Scenario 1 demo and discussion
5. Scenario 2 demo and discussion
6. Scenario 3 demo and discussion
7. Hands-on practice with time for additional questions and answers

What to bring if you would like to try things
1. Get your laptop
2. Preferably with a brand new activated AWS account with free tier
benefits intact

What you should know
1. Basic idea of terms used for public clouds such as AWS
2.  Basic idea of how to use command line tools and follow along
