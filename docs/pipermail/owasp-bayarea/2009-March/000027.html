Next CISSP Review Course scheduled for May 18 through June 29

As a service to its members and Bay Area security professionals, the Silicon
Valley ISSA Chapter offers an inexpensive CISSP Review Course on a regular
basis. The chapter goal is to offer this course twice yearly, Spring and
Fall. The chapter has maintained this twice-yearly schedule since 2005. 

The next class is scheduled for consecutive Monday nights, May 18 through
June 29 (no class May 25 - Memorial Day). The class will be held at Ariba,
807 11th Avenue Sunnyvale

The classes run from 6:00 PM to 9:30 PM. Classes typically number up to
30-35 students. From 6:00 - 6:30 PM, we have review, quizzes, a discussion
of the previous week's domain discussion, and Q&amp;A. From 6:30 - 9:30 PM, a
security domain expert will mentor one or two of the CISSP domains,
depending upon the complexity of the domain. Silicon Valley ISSA charges $50
for ISSA members and $85 for non-ISSA members.

The course rotates around the valley. Several Bay Area companies have
volunteered to provide their facilities for past classes, including Ariba,
Adobe, Verisign, Cisco, Nokia, and others. We thank Ariba for hosting the
current class and several previous classes. If your company would be
interesting in hosting a future class, please contact the CISSP Review
Coordinator at mail &lt;at&gt; security-education &lt;dot&gt; com . 

The course provides a detailed presentation of each of the ten CISSP
security domains. A CD-ROM of CISSP study material, including audio MP3
recordings of a previous class and presentation material will be distributed
at the first class. A companion website is available for students. The URL
and password will be provided on the first night. The class/website also
includes: a review of the CISSP examination, recommended books, studying
recommendations, Web sites of interest, about a hundred open source
presentations/papers, and test taking techniques. 

Registration 

To register for the next class please send an email to:  mail &lt;at&gt;
security-education &lt;dot&gt; com . Please pass this notice to other security
professionals at your company or organization.
