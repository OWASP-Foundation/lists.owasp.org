	Injection Vulnerabilities
Message-ID: <CAOJpPh+ULFPv09PmRUc4S7M=2K2TMLEG03m8UnS-Q-KRcQSBrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am happy to announce another Hacker Thursday event on 26th October 6 pm
 to 8 pm. The session is invite only, so if you're interested please fill
out the form below especially "how you think this course will be beneficial
to you".


Form:- https://goo.gl/forms/N8dO5YK1EjujT8HI3


Venue: ShieldX Networks Inc. 2025 Gateway Place, Suite 400, San Jose CA
<https://maps.google.com/?q=2025+Gateway+Place,+Suite+400,+San+Jose+CA&entry=gmail&source=g>

Talk Details:-
Injection vulnerabilities have been listed as the top item in the OWASP Top
10 since 2010 and this is not by mistake.  Injection vulnerabilities are
fairly easy to overlook and many times just as easy to exploit.  More times
than not, what seems like a simple injection may be the key to a very
successful devastating attack vector.  Join us in a hands-on workshop
getting to know some of the more common types of injections and how you can
find and exploit these vulnerabilities using the Mutillidae vulnerability
training web app. Exploit vulnerabilities like SQL Injection. Use tools
like SQL map and Havij. Session will be good for Infosec beginners and
Intermediates.

Speaker details in his own words:-
Matt Torbin BIO
As a multi-faceted technologist with almost twenty years in the industry,
I've had a direct impact on almost every aspect of the software development
lifecycle. For the majority of my career, I worked as a front-end, full
stack engineer specializing in UI/UX. During this time I was involved in
development as well as testing which included both quality and security
efforts. Over the course of the last few years, I completed a career
transition to application security with a focus on security evangelism
roles where I worked closely with development teams. In my free time, I am
passionate about promoting equality in the industry and offering mentorship
to up-and-coming technologists. My goal is to leave behind a better
industry than the one I found when I first began my career.

Again, to attend please fill out the form:

Hi Team,

For A4: XML External Entity (XXE) - I see a lot of that in the field though in terms of lack of configuration. Surprised to see little research has be done with embedded / inline files in XML.

Surprised we are including XML, where JSON implementations are rapidly overtaking it. No mention of HTML5 feature rich specific vulns neither. I guess more security research needs to be looked into these areas to make it to top 10.

#########

I think the A8: Insecure Serialization is a good one with a big potential for further eye-opening research across different programming languages. A sign of our times in 2017.

#########

I?m on the fence about A:10 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring. Though I see it everywhere in code and lack of, misconfigurations, etc. I  really don?t see it as an ? Legit' Attack Vector as each of the rest of the Top 10 categories are. It?s most always a Low finding anyways and geared more for a different profession such as Incident Response -which is Out-of-Scope.

########

Glad to see  "Insufficient Attack Protection? was removed. -That one seemed like a thinly veiled vendor pitch from some product pushing scum.

#######

Questions, comments, Stimulating Ideas???

There isnt ?much awareness about Serialization issues. It will be great if someone can take a session on this vulnerability. I can help?facilitate that session in upcoming OWASP meets in Bay area. Can someone volunteer ?
