<PRE>Simple survey format may not work if you need more than just
yes/no/fill-in types of questions. In some cases network and architecture
diagrams are necessary as well as additional documentation. Information
sensitivity is also an important factor to consider, especially when you
review an app written by a 3d party. Web app in this case would have to be
protected by reliable authentication mechanism.

Given the sensitivity of information normally requested for code reviews I
tend to think Word/Excel document appears to be a much simpler way. I'm
not saying the web app is not a feasible solution, it's just not as simple
as it appears if you really consider all related issues.

You could also use Survey Monkey's free surveys (upto 10 questions) to
qualify the application; if it deserves more questions, then you can sign
up for their service.  Would be faster than building an app for this, IMO.
