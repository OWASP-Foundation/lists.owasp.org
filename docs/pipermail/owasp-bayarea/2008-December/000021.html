Protecting Website Users from Each Other

Brian Shura, Sr. Consultant, AppSec Consulting

 

Abstract:  

Most often the login page or &quot;front door&quot; of a website is built securely and
is difficult for an attacker to break through.  However, web developers
often leave serious holes in web applications after the login, which can
allow one malicious user to access another user's personal information.
This presentation will cover several vulnerabilities frequently found in the
&quot;logged-in&quot; portion of web applications, how to detect these issues, and how
to ensure your applications don't have these security problems.

 

Bio:

Brian Shura is a senior application security consultant at AppSec
Consulting.  He has conducted numerous web application security assessments,
using a combination of manual and automated techniques, and has created
world-class security training for developers and QA analysts.  Brian is also
the Project Leader for the Web Application Security Consortium's &quot;Web
Application Security Scanner Evaluation Criteria&quot; project.  Prior to his
role in application security, Brian spent five years working as a developer
on large Internet-facing websites.  When not working on web application
security initiatives, Brian enjoys fishing and hiking the Appalachian Trail.

 

 

Making Money the Black Hat Way

Trey Ford, WhiteHat Security 

 

Abstract:  

Forget Cross-Site Scripting. Forget SQL Injection. If you want to make some
serious cash on the Web, these aren't the tools you need.  No expensive toys
to license, ninja coding skillz or all-black wardrobe required.  All you
need is a Web browser, a sharp eye, and a couple black hat tricks.  In this
talk we will be discussing attacks that are legal by the letter, violating
only terms of service (yes that means a locked account, not a lawsuit)

            

Also known as business logic flaws, often these attacks aren't found in
books, rarely covered in the news, and statistics are limits. However, we do
know they are out there and the bad guys have been lining the pockets with
them for years. Security vendors don't like talking about business logic
flaws because their products don't know how to detect them. Most of the
examples we'll cover are only found in online hacker forums and/or stumbled
upon by complete accident.  In this session we will open the hood and
discuss how the professional hackers make real cash- the black hat way

 

Bio:

Trey Ford is the director of solutions architecture at WhiteHat Security,
providing vision to customers, partners, and prospects on their website
security initiatives.  Mr. Ford also spearheads WhiteHat's participation in
the PCI Standards Council and assists customers in navigating application
security strategies.  With a consulting background in risk assessment and
regulatory compliance, Mr. Ford is a frequent speaker at industry events,
and is frequently quoted in media publications.  Prior to WhiteHat, Trey
served as compliance practice lead at FishNet Security.
