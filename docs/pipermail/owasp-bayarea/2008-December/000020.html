Protecting Website Users from Each Other

Brian Shura, Sr. Consultant, AppSec Consulting

 

Abstract:  

Most often the login page or &quot;front door&quot; of a website is built securely and
is difficult for an attacker to break through.  However, web developers
often leave serious holes in web applications after the login, which can
allow one malicious user to access another user's personal information.
This presentation will cover several vulnerabilities frequently found in the
&quot;logged-in&quot; portion of web applications, how to detect these issues, and how
to ensure your applications don't have these security problems.

 

Bio:

Brian Shura is a senior application security consultant at AppSec
Consulting.  He has conducted numerous web application security assessments,

world-class security training for developers and QA analysts.  Brian is also
the Project Leader for the Web Application Security Consortium's &quot;Web
Application Security Scanner Evaluation Criteria&quot; project.  Prior to his
