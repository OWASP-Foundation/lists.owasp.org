<PRE>Greetings IT Professionals,

 

The Silicon Valley Chapter of the Information Systems Audit and Control
Association (ISACA) would like to remind you that their December Monthly
Meeting will be held this Thursday (December 18, 2008). They have two great
presentations scheduled by representatives of security heavyweights Symantec
and McAfee:

 

The Underground Economy: The Symantec Report on the Underground Economy
examines activity on underground economy servers observed by Symantec
between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008. It includes analysis and discussion
of the goods and services advertised, advertisers participating in the
economy, the servers and channels that host the trading, and a snapshot of
piracy activity observed.

 

Putting Security into Your Virtual World: As virtualization technology grows
in popularity, the big question about security is buzzing: &quot;How will this
technology affect my existing security posture?&quot;  Taking a one-size-fits-all
approach is definitely not the answer. Find out the best way to start
securing your Virtualization environment during this talk from a Principal
Consultant and Trainer at McAfee. 

 

For further details, or to register, go to the Meetings and Events
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.isaca-sv.org/meetings.html">http://www.isaca-sv.org/meetings.html</A>&gt;  tab of ISACA-SV website.

 

Lastly, please SAVE THE FOLLOWING DATES -- February 25, 26, and 27, 2009.
The ISACA-SV Conference Committee is hard at work on their 2009 Winter
Conference, a three-day event that will be held at the e-Bay Conference
Center in San Jose. The conference schedule includes a full day of training
on the first day of the conference, followed by presentations and networking
opportunities on the remaining days. The event will cover both Audit and
Security topics. To learn more about this event, see page 4 of the December
Chip &lt;<A HREF="http://www.isaca-sv.org/December2008Chip.pdf">http://www.isaca-sv.org/December2008Chip.pdf</A>&gt; . To volunteer, sponsor
or speak at this event, please send an e-mail to
