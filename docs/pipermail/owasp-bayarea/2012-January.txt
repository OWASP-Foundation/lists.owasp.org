Hi Deb, 

Thanks a lot for getting back in touch with us. We have had several people
respond with interest in hosting OWASP meetings. Could I ask you for some
information? 


1. Where is Cigital, Inc. located?
2. How many attendees do you think your space will accommodate?
3. Do you have any ideas for speakers or topics?

Thanks again,
