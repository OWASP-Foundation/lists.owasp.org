<PRE>Hi All,
Happy to announce our hands-on meet for July. Please fill the form to
register.

Talk:-  OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) 101
Venue: Upgrade Inc, 275 Battery Street, 23rd floor, San Francisco

Registration form:-  <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/fPJZrfeXFxrFHgam1">https://goo.gl/forms/fPJZrfeXFxrFHgam1</A>

Trainer Bio:-
Shubham Mittal works as CTO at Neotas Ltd. and is an Infosec researcher
with good experience in OSINT, Offensive/Defensive security. He has
spoken/trained/presented at many conferences including Black Hat, DEFCON,
HackMiami, NullCon, c0c0n, and IETF. He is the author of OSINT Framework -
DataSploit and is core organizer of @Recon Village at Defcon. He works from
the command line, uses vi and loves beer.

Talk Description:-
As it is commonly said,  real hacking is 90%  enumeration(reconnaissance)
and 10 % actual attack. Understanding your target is the first step towards
gaining access be it your professional penetration testing or your free
time bug bounty. This will be a basic hands-on session on Open Source
Intelligence from a normal human's perspective. The primary goal of the
session: To gain an understanding of how OSINT works and to understand how
different tools and techniques, how to make notes, mind maps, etc.

You need more but useful information which you can utilize to perform more
targeted attacks. Gathering precise information about your target is
something which is mandatory for every intelligent attack. In this talk, we
will focus on our quick and dirty approach (not sure if it's dirty), which
can be used to grab low hanging fruits as soon as they bloom. We will call
it Intelligent Information Gathering.

Overview of what we will cover during the session:

1. Advanced Search (Beyond Google)
2. Basic OSINT on an organization
3. Discovering Assets
4. OSINT on a Person
        Email ID
        Username
        Name
5. Keeping an Eye on Target (Monitoring/Alerting)
6. Online Anonymity
7. Miscellaneous Fun Learnings

Prerequisites:

1.    Basic knowledge of pen-testing. (so that you understand what exactly
are we trying to do in this session). We don&#8217;t mind if you are learning
OSINT for some other purpose, however, we will keep our session around pen
testing.
2. If you want to follow up with the instructor, you should bring your own
laptop with Firefox and Chrome installed.
3. If you wish, you can also load your laptop with Spiderfoot/ DataSploit/
Maltego.
