<PRE>Hi All,

Date:- August 2nd, 2018, 6 to 8 pm
Venue:- Illumino, 160 San Gabriel Dr, Sunnyvale, ca, 94086

Live Stream:- Not confirmed as of now.

Talk Description:
Understanding &amp; Exploiting Common Crypto-Coding Mistakes

Session Description :
Cryptography is difficult to understand and complex to implement. Coding
for cryptographic implementations needs all the more different
considerations and awareness to get it right then the non-crypto
applications. Even the best programmers around the world make common
mistakes while implementing crypto-applications.

For this session we have chosen top 4 mistakes involved in high profile
compromises/breaches in recent times. The session will include hands on lab
with code snippits and heavy use of Openssl for practical demonstration of
correct/incorrect crypto-implementations.

Overview of what we will cover during the session:

1. Casual Random approach :
We ill be understanding what is Randomness and why it is hard to generate
random numbers.
Source of entropy
Which random functions to use and why?
common mistakes while dealing with random number generator
Recent incidents - Tangle key generation for IOTA etc

2. Poor Decisions
Copying crypto code from net
Using defaults
Hard coding sensitive information
Recent Incidents - few attacks on bitcoin wallets to LOGJAM/FREAK in the
past

3. Insecure crypto coding
Side channel attacks
Introduction to with timing attacks
Buffer over reads
Length extension of hashes and address
Recent Incidents - Ethereum address extension to Specter, ticket bleed,
heart-bleed

4. Parameter Reuse
Risk of reusing keys
Risk of reusing nonce or salt
Recent Incidents - Brain wallets hacks

Prerequisites:

1. Basic understanding of programming/cryptography.
2. Each of the sections mentioned above comprises labs in C/C++ and uses
Openssl as swiss army knife of cryptography.
3. We encourage you to bring your own laptops with a Linux/Mac OS/ VM
running on it.
4.The session is equally useful for Programmers, testers and security
professionals
