Will you have internet connectivity setup for the event? I work for BofA used to work for Mcafee who bought Scanalert. I've tested sites for over 4 years and very much support this organization. I would love to help and if there it internet connectivity. I can get my work done at the booth while I'm not working the booth. Let me know if this is possible if it is call me and I'm there to help. I would love this opportunity and to get more involved with owasp sf.

Hi all
 
We are still looking for volunteers to help us with the OWASP booth at RSA. Please let us know as soon as possible if you can give a few hours to support us. Once we have your names, we need to register you to get your badges. 
 
Thanks!

Dear fellow Bay Area OWASPians
 
OWASP will have a booth at this year&#8217;s RSA show the week of April 20th at Moscone Center in San Francisco. We need volunteers to do booth duty on any of the days from 21st through 23rd. Please let us know ASAP with the times and days you can do the booth duty and we&#8217;ll get you exhibitor badges. 
 
Also, please mark your calendars for our next Bay Area wide OWASP meeting tentatively scheduled for May 14th. More details to follow. 
 
Thank you for your help!
 
Best regards, 
 
Mandeep Khera
