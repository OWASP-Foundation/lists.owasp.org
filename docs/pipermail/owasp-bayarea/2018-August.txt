Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] OWASP Hands-on session: Attacking & Auditing Docker
 Containers Using Open Source tools
Message-ID: <CAAf4JyTqUktC2H+JW=Ahs9qZNgEcU6xfcnKXJsX7rXfUrqgR3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
We are glad to announce an OWASP hands-on sessions on "Attacking & Auditing
Docker Containers Using Open Source".  This is a part of Defcon26 workshop(
https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-workshops.html#akula).

Please confirm your attendance by registering on below form.

Date:- August 13th, 2018. 6 to 8 pm
Venue:- Upgrade Inc, 275 Battery Street, 23rd floor, San Francisco
Form:- https://goo.gl/forms/SuQZ4G1lBti3FBFy2

Live Stream:- Will be published soon.


Talk Description:
Attacking & Auditing Docker Containers Using Open Source tools

Session Description :
This is a part of Defcon26 workshop(
https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-workshops.html#akula).
Developers and Operations teams (DevOps) have moved towards containers and
modern technologies. Attackers are catching up with these technologies and
finding security flaws in them. In this workshop, we will look at how we
can test for security issues and vulnerabilities in Dockerised environments
. Throughout the workshop we will learn how we can find security
misconfigurations, insecure defaults and container escape techniques to
gain access to host operating system (or) clusters. In the workshop, we
will look at real world scenarios where attackers compromised containers to
gain the access to applications, data and other assets.

Prerequisites: Basic familiarity with Linux and Docker

Materials: A laptop with administrator privileges
10 GB of free Hard Disk Space
Ideally 8 GB of RAM but minimum 4 GB
Laptop should support hardware-based virtualization
If your laptop can run a 64-bit virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox it
should work
Other virtualisation software might work but we will not be able to provide
support for that.

Madhu Akula
Madhu is a security ninja and published author, security and devops
researcher with extensive experience in the industry ranging from client
facing assignments building scalable and secure infrastructure, to
publishing industry leading research to running training sessions for
companies and governments alike.

conferences including Defcon 24, Blackhat USA 2018, All Day DevOps (2016,
2017), DevSecCon (London, Singapore, Boston), DevOpsDays India, c0c0n,
Serverless Summit, ToorCon, DefCamp, SkydogCon, NolaCon and null, etc.
Madhu was a keynote speaker for the National Cyber Security conference at
Dayananda Sagar College in Feb 2016. Madhu has trained over 5000 people in
information security for companies and organisations including the Indian
Navy and the Ministry of e-services in a leading Gulf state. He is
co-author of Security Automation with Ansible2 book published by Packt

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] 14th august:- HandExpl-iot Framework - IoT Security
 Testing and Exploitation Framework
Message-ID: <CAAf4JyT20bsUgw1Snk_aEXK9t+VeNLEVdedMJ-SEcNmss1sXRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
Happy to announce a hands-on meet on IOT Security. Please fill the form to
book your seat.

Topic: Expl-iot Framework - IoT Security Testing and Exploitation Framework
Dates:- 14th August, 6 to 8 pm.
Location:- City College of San Francisco, 50 Phelan Ave, San Francisco, CA
94112
Form: https://goo.gl/forms/mApUDQOS2wc2XVUp2

Abstract
After working on IoT security testing for a few years, we realized that
there is a lot of time spent on learning and setting up different tools
including hardware, radio and software. As the IoT technology is new there
are no standard software to test most of the components and the tools
available are either not mature yet or do only specific job. With this
problem at hand we envisioned a software that would allow developers and
researchers to automate most of the IoT security testing steps. We began
our journey with writing a flexible and extendable framework that would
help the community and us in writing quick IoT test cases and exploits.
The objectives of the framework are:
1. Easy of use
2. Extendable
3. Support for hardware, radio and IoT protocol analysis

We have released the alpha version of the framework recently -
https://gitlab.com/expliot_framework/expliot
The beta release is envisioned to have support for UART(serial), ZigBee,
BLE, MQTT, CoAP (next version will have support for JTAG, I2C and SPI) and
few miscellaneous test cases, exploits. This workshop would give attendees
a first hand view of the functionality, how to use it and how to write
plugins to extend the framework.

Hi All,
Happy to announce an OWASP Hacker Thursdays event on topic "DevSecOps the
Kubernetes Way". We will utilize 5.30 to 6 pm for food and networking,
session will start from 6 pm. Drinks and pizza will be served at the
meet.Please fill below form to confirm attendance.


Date:- August 30th, 2018. 5.30 to 8 pm
Venue:- Segment, 100 California St, Suite 700, San Francisco, CA,
Form:- https://goo.gl/forms/YSPaArGGtZlT6rcr1

Talk Description:
The Cloud as we know it is changing. Containers have taken the center stage
as the preferred method of developing and deploying software into
production. As security practitioners, we must adapt to the latest
technologies or be left in the dust.
This workshop is a mix of lecture and labs and focuses on the ins and outs
of building a Kubernetes infrastructure capable of taking containers from a
developer?s laptop to production, in a secure manner.
The hands-on portion of the workshop will rely on Kubernetes for the
deployment and orchestration of Docker containers. Each student will build
a sandbox Kubernetes cluster from scratch on their local machines using
Goole Kubernetes Engine. We will cover the following topics throughout the
workshop:

    Fast and Furious Introduction to Kubernetes
    Common Kubernetes Security Issues and Remediations
    Kubernetes Authentication and Authorization
    Logging in Kubernetes
    Building an Automated Security Testing Pipeline in Kubernetes

Plenty of time will be left for Q&A and open discussion.

Student Requirements
Familiarity with at least one public cloud provider is recommend. Students
should also have basic Docker knowledge and experience launching and
managing basic cloud instances. Basic command line and scripting skills are
highly recommended. No Kubernetes experience is required.

Laptop Requirements
Any laptop with a modern web browser to access Google Cloud Platform. GCP
credentials will be provided.

About the Speaker
Jimmy Mesta is a veteran application security leader that has spent time on
both the offense and defense side of the industry. His core focus has been
in application and cloud security with an emphasis on secure architecture,
automated testing, developer training and modern defensive techniques.
He is the chapter leader of OWASP Santa Barbara and co-organizes the AppSec
California and LocoMoco security conferences. He is a frequent speaker and
trainer at conferences such as AppSec USA and BSides.

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] 6sep Hacker Thursdays: Microcontrollers and Single
 Board Computers for Hacking, Fun and Profit
Message-ID: <CAAf4JySdzcAMSig+odV1gvyuXeMyMcCCv1Z=zgtOaG0MK6fK2w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
We are happy to announce a OWASP Hacker Thursdays event on 6th September
titled "Microcontrollers and Single Board Computers for Hacking, Fun and
Profit".
Details below. Please sign on the below form to confirm your seat.

Date: Thursday, September 6th | 5.30:00PM - 8:30PM
Venue: Hackerone, 300 Montgomery Street, 12th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104

Form:- https://goo.gl/forms/3ayNqvJMHAFxSVh13

Talk Description:
----------------------------
As security researchers, we are always looking for the next device that
will make our jobs easier and our research more effective. In many cases,
physical gear can be expensive which can be prohibitive, especially in
engagements where dead drops are required. However, with the skyrocketing
popularity of microcontrollers and single board computers, that barrier has
been reduced significantly and has created a host of new possibilities for
everything from dead drops to wired and wireless network intrusion and
analysis.

During the first portion of the workshop, join Matt Torbin as he introduces
some of the more popular options in this genre, including demonstrations of
his case studies. Specifically Matt will demonstrate three devices he built
to solve specific problems and that are based on these platforms: ATtiny85,
ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi. As a bonus, Matt will also demonstrate a simple
technique that uses Applescript and Bash that can be used to create a
simple USB trojan and can be useful for end-user training.

After the presentation, there will be a hands-on exercise using the
ATtiny85 to build the ?Poor Man?s Rubber Ducky? which was demo'd this year
in Matt's presentation at DEF CON 26.
*THE FIRST 50 ATTENDEES will be provided with an ATtiny85 kit which they
can program and take home. *Should attendees wish to purchase their own,
they can find the device used here:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/Digispark-Kickstarter-ATTINY85-Arduino-General-Micro-USB-Development-Board-N94/113026719643?epid=1873410506&hash=item1a50eadf9b%3Ag%3A8uIAAOSwxQJbDlFJ&LH_BIN=1

Attendee Requirements:
-----------------------------------------
1. Attendees should feel comfortable with basic programming skills.
Knowledge of fundamental programming structures such as variables, loops,
blocks and methods is critical, though a specific language is not.
2. Attendees should have a basic understanding of their respective
operating systems and the underlying command line utility. Specific tasks
during the workshop may include changing directories and editing files.

Hardware/Software Requirements:
---------------------------------------------------------
Attendees must bring a laptop with the following specifications:

1. While there is no specific operating system requirements, a strong
preference should be noted for Unix, Linux and OSX. The presenter and
volunteers will do their best to be operating system agnostic though no
guarantees can be made.
2. Laptop must either have USB-A type sockets or attendees must bring an
adapter. NOTE FOR APPLE USERS: The Apple-branded adapters will not work
with the ATtiny85. Please consider purchasing a third party adapter such as
this which has been tested and proven to work:
https://www.frys.com/product/9057427
3. Laptops must have the Arduino IDE already installed. Attendees can
download this software from the Arduino web site:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

About the Speaker:
--------------------------------
Matt Torbin has worked on almost every aspect of the software development
lifecycle. For the majority of his career, he worked as a front-end, full
stack engineer specializing in UI/UX. During this time, he was involved in
development and also testing efforts, which included quality and security
best practices. In the last few years, Matt completed a career transition
to application security engineering, most notably through security
evangelism roles, where he worked closely with development teams. As an
application security engineer, Matt is responsible for security best
practices, which encompasses both digital and physical threat vectors. Most
recently, Matt is the concept creator and team lead for the Day of
Shecurity conference which took place on June 16th in San Francisco, CA. In
his free time, he is passionate about promoting equality in the
cybersecurity industry and offering mentorship to young technologists. His
