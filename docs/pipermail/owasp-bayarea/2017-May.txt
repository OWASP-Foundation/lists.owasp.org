Hi all,

The OWASP Bay Area chapter is pleased to announce two meet-ups for the
month of May/June.  As usual we'll have one in San Francisco and one in
South Bay:

South Bay @ Netflix
<https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/238193929/>
San Francisco @ Lending Club
<https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/238193939/>

We'll announce the meet-ups on meetup.com later in the week but as usual
want to give our members priority.

Thanks!
