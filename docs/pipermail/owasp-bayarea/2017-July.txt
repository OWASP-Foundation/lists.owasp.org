Hi Folks,We are planing to organize hands on ?sessions at OWASP Bay area. We want to start with some basic sessions and slowly increase the complexity of the topic.Sessions will be invite only and people who contribute to OWASP bay area and attend meet ups regularly will be given preference. ?If you want to contribute and be trainer for any session then please let us know. Some of the topic which we feel might be interesting to larger audiences are :
1. OWASP top 10, hands on using a vulnerable app like Web goat2. Beginning mobile app pen testing (android/iOS)3. Python for pentesters4. Metasploit for pentesters5. IOT security6. OSINT
So please drop me a mail incase you are interested.
RegardsPrashant
