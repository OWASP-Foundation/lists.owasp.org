Hi all,

We've got two back-to-back meet-ups scheduled for January:

January 11th (SF) @ Bleacher Report: 153 Kearny Street, 2nd Floor, San
Francisco, CA 94108

January 12th (Redwood City) @ Synack: 1600 Seaport Boulevard, Redwood City,
CA Building - #170 North

You'll need to be registered on usual "Bay Area OWASP" meetup page to
enter, but we want to give heads up priority to OWASP members.  Both
meet-ups will be posted Wednesday December 19th at 9AM (PST).

Thank you,
 - Bay Area OWASP Leadership

Hi all,

Just a reminder- we've announced two meetups for January:

SF January 11th <https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/236377791/>
Redwood City January 12th
<https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/236377794/>

I will announce these through Meetup in a day or two but want to give
priority to mailing list subscribers.

Thanks,
 - Travis
