Introduction to Cloud Security Alliance


Abstract: The mission of the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is to promote the
use of best practices for providing security assurance within Cloud
Computing, and provide education on the uses of Cloud Computing to help
secure all other forms of computing.  Mr. Puhlmann will discuss hot topics
and issues related to secure cloud computing.


Speaker Bio:  Nils Puhlmann - CISO, Zynga, Co-Founder of Cloud Security
Alliance
Nils Puhlmann has extensive experience in developing and implementing IT
security strategy and policy, corporate governance, network security,
intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, IT security audit, network
design and secure messaging solutions. Always on the leading edge of
security practices, Mr. Puhlmann co-founded the Cloud Security Alliance, a
non-profit organization formed to promote the use of best practices for
providing security assurance within Cloud Computing environments. Prior to
Cloud Security Alliance, Mr. Puhlmann acted as CSO &amp; VP of Risk Management
for Qualys, a leader in on- demand vulnerability management and policy
compliance solutions.  Before Qualys he was the Chief Information Security

subject matter expert for ISACA International and a frequent speaker at
international security conferences. He is a graduate of Kant College in

Approaches to Quantitative Risk Analysis for Web Applications



Abstract: Various methods exist for performing risk analysis for web
applications. Quantitative risk analysis models are often regarded as
vulnerability scoring systems as they give a numeric score for vulnerability
risk. Performing actionable risk analysis require more than a spreadsheet or
formulas, it requires sound principles that inform action. This presentation
will focus on presenting core metrics for performing risk analysis as well
as several key principles that should be the foundation of any application
risk management program.

Speaker Bio: Lars Ewe, Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of
Engineering for Cenzic
Lars is a technology executive with broad background in (web) application
development and security, middleware infrastructure, software development
and application/system manageability technologies. Throughout his career
Lars has held key positions in engineering, product management/marketing,
and sales in a variety of different markets. Prior to Cenzic, Lars was
software development director at Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., responsible
for AMD's overall systems manageability and related security strategy and
all related engineering efforts.

Profile of a Hacker vs. Traditional Security Wisdom

Abstract: The Verizon Data Security Report highlights the source and
motivation of many high profile data security breaches.  What's not
surprising is that most of these security breaches are the result of common
web application vulnerabilities being exploited.  This informative
discussion will highlight WhiteHat Security's research regarding the
attacker profile and traditional security wisdom.  This presentation will
provide trends and recommendations on what you can do to keep your company
out of the headlines.

Speaker Bio: Arian Evans, Director of Operations, WhiteHat Security
Arian Evans currently holds the position of director of operations at
WhiteHat Security in Santa Clara where his team specializes in application,
code, software security with an emphasis on the current threatscape.  In the
past he bootstrapped the application security practice at FishNet Security
and is internationally published &amp; recognized for research in the field of
software security.  Arian has presented at International conferences
including OWASP London &amp; DC BlackHat Amsterdam &amp; Vegas, and NIST and was an
initial Project Leader of OWASP Testing Taxonomy &amp; Testing Tools projects.
