Current Web Application Threat Landscape

Arian Evans, Director of Operations, WhiteHat Security 

 

Abstract:  

The Verizon Data Security Report highlights the source of many high profile
data security breaches.  What's not surprising is that most of these
security breaches are the result of common web application vulnerabilities
being exploited.  This informative discussion will highlight Whitehat's web
application security research and its relationship to the Verizon Data
Security Report.  This presentation will provide recommendations on what you
can do to keep your company out of the headlines.
