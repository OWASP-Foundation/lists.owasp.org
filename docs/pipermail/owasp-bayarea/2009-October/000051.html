<PRE>Get Your CISSP This Year

The Silicon Valley ISSA sponsored Fall 2009 CISSP Review Class will be held
over six consecutive Monday nights, Nov 2 through Dec 7, at SonicWALL.
Valley ISSA thanks SonicWALL for agreeing to host this latest class.
SonicWALL is located at 2001 Logic Drive, San Jose
&lt;<A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=2001+Logic+Driv">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=2001+Logic+Driv</A>
e,+San+Jose&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&gt; , near I85 and Union Avenue.

Silicon Valley ISSA offers these CISSP Review classes twice a year, Spring
and Fall. Over 400 Silicon Valley professionals have attended these classes
since 2002. Registration is now open and those interested can send an email
to  mail &lt;at&gt; security-education &lt;dot&gt; com. The fee will be $50 for current
ISSA or ISACA members and $85 for non-members. Please bring a check for that
amount to the first meeting.

Each class will be instructed by a Silicon Valley CISSP-accredited security
professional, who is experienced in that domain. Classes are taught over six
Monday nights, 6:00 PM to 9:30 PM. From 6:00 until 6:30 PM, there will be a
discussion of the previous week's domain, Q&amp;A, and quizzes. From 6:30 until
9:30, the domain mentor will provide instruction on either 1 or 2 domains,
depending upon the complexity of the domains. Each student will receive a CD
ROM of all material, which includes a copy of the domain lecture material,
an MP3 recording of that domain from a previous session, collateral material
on each of the domains, recommended books, links to articles for each
domain, and both studying and test taking advice. The first class will
include an in-depth introduction to CISSP and include a Q&amp;A session. A
companion website is also available and the link and password will be
provided on the first night.
