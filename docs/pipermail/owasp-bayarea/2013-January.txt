Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Meeting tonight - Full, but streaming online!
Message-ID: <CAPgEqGamrDPNdL6BsJNrybdvqqybLwxeEJAwn7T9+Y+7fJGTLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

Our scheduled meeting is filled to capacity, but thanks to Mozilla, it will
be streaming online so you can attend virtually. The video stream will be
at https://air.mozilla.org/owasp-community-event/ and the content will
start at around 6.

Agenda:

6:00 - Welcome & Overview of OWASP Mobile Projects

6:15 - Securing Android Applications, Jesse Burns

7:10 - Break

7:20 - Securing iOS Applications, Blake Turrentine


Based on demand, we will now look for event space in San Francisco that
will include capacity for at least 75 people for future meetings (we had 20
people on the waiting list).
