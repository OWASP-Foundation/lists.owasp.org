<PRE>Hi All,
We are glad to announce a Hands-on meet on &quot;OWASP Security Knowledge
Framework &quot;.
The talk will be preceded with hands-on event on Web app Hacking. *Please
fill the form to confirm your participation.*

Date:- 16th Nov, Friday 6 to 8 PM
Venue:- Synopsys, 185 Berry St, Lobby 3, Floor 6, Suite 6500
*Form*:-  <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/d1jngx81DobY16b72">https://goo.gl/forms/d1jngx81DobY16b72</A>

Talk Details:-
During our work as penetration testers we found that there where a lot of
vulnerabilities
that could have been easily prevented whenever the developers where given
proper
guidance and security requirements.  This session will be preceeded by Web
application hacking hands-on.

In the current state of software development with the whole (S)SDLC in
place, the
security tooling integrated in your security pipe-lines will not cover the
whole attack surface. This is because the tooling can never understand the
full
context of the applications functions and logic, but the developers can!

We believe that the developers are the real champions and with proper
guidance, awareness and
toolsets they can lift the maturity of the projects security to a whole new
level!

This is why we developed the OWASP Security Knowledge Framework!

What is the OWASP Security Knowledge Framework?

Over 10 years of experience in web application security bundled into a
single application.
The Security Knowledge Framework is a vital asset to the coding toolkit of
you and your development team.
Use SKF to learn and integrate security by design in your web application.

SKF is an open source security knowledgebase including manageble projects
with checklists
and best practice code examples in multiple programming languages showing
you how to
prevent hackers gaining access and running exploits on your application.

In a nutshell:

- It Trains your developers in writing secure code
- It utilizes ASVS for setting up the right security requirements
- For each ASVS item there is a knowledge base item that guides the
developer with implementation
- Developers and security specialist can keep audit trails of the
requirements to do verification in implementation
- It contains code examples that teach the secure coding principles!

About the trainers:

Glenn ten Cate:
As a coder, hacker, speaker, trainer and security researcher employed at
ING Belgium as the security chapter leader.
Glenn has over 10 years experience in the field of security. One of the
founders of defensive development [defdev] a security training and
conference
series dedicated to helping you build and maintain secure software and also
speaking at multiple other security conferences
in the world. His goals is to create an open-source software development
life cycle with the tools and knowledge gathered over the years.

Riccardo ten Cate:
As a penetration tester from the Netherlands Riccardo specializes in
application security and has extensive knowledge in
securing applications in multiple coding languages. Riccardo has many years
of experience in training and guiding
development teams.

Riccardo also has expertise on implementing security test automation in
CI/CD pipelines.
This helps create short feedback loops back to the developer and prevents
bugs from getting into
production into an early phase of the development lifecycle. By combining
these skillsets into the SKF
Riccardo helps development teams becoming more mature and making their
applications secure by design.
