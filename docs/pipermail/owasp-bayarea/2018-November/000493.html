<PRE>Hi All,
We are glad to announce a Hands-on meet on &quot;Anatomy of Recent Security
Breaches&quot;.
The talk will be preceded with attack simulation. Please fill the form to
confirm your participation.

Date: Monday, November 19th | 6:00PM - 8:00PM
Venue: Zillow Group 535 Mission St, Suite 700 San Francisco, CA 94105
Form:- <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/VcqItqpNz5Hs83h92">https://goo.gl/forms/VcqItqpNz5Hs83h92</A>

Instructions to enter the seventh floor: Each attendee will have to sign in
with security in the lobby on the ground floor (they will need to be sent
up to the 7th floor). Once they are on the 7th floor, we should have signs
pointing them to &quot;The Bay&quot; event space; this is our large conference space
next to our cafeteria.

Talk Description:
This hands-on session focuses on the design problems and technical issues
behind the most recent security breaches of Facebook, British Airways,
Yahoo and Equifax. By analysing them in depth, we understand that they
could have been evaded by the right security consciousness. So we explore
the story behind each breach and solve a corresponding security challenge
afterwards. These challenges will give a real insight into the risks of XSS
bugs, broken access controls on Content Delivery Networks, insecure
access-tokens and outdated 3rd-party dependencies. Avatao provides the
infrastructure to host these exercises so everybody can easily join to
solve them.

Requirements:

-          Browser with internet access
-          Python 3 installed
-          Experience with XSS
-          A fair understanding of coding will be helpful

Trainer:
G&#225;bor P&#233;k

G&#225;bor is a co-founder and CTO at Avatao, a cloud-based virtual lab to teach
people build secure software and systems. He earned his Ph.D. degree in
2015 from the CrySyS Lab of Budapest University of Technology and
Economics, but completed internships at iSecLab at Eurecom, France and TU
Wien, Austria, too. His main research focus was on malware analysis and
virtualization security. One of the vulnerabilities he found
(XSA-59/CVE-2013-3495) affected several Intel chipsets that enabled attacks
against hypervisors such as Xen or KVM. He was one of the key members of
the Duqu, Flame, Miniduke and Teamspy targeted attack investigation teams.
He founded and coordinated CrySyS Student Core for almost 5 years, which
was an invite-only group of exceptionally talented students interested in
system security. This group gave birth to the &quot;!SpamAndHex&quot; (
<A HREF="https://ctftime.org/team/5347">https://ctftime.org/team/5347</A>) CTF team, which became one of the top teams
in the world in 2 years. As a member of !SpamAndHex he is a three-times
DEFCON CTF finalist, that is widely regarded as the hacker world
championship. Over the years, he gave talks at several cyber security
conferences in the academia (e.g., ACM AsiaCCS, ESORICS, USENIX ASE ) and
industry (e.g., DevSecCon, POC, Belluminar, Hacktivity) also.

Again, Please fill the form to confirm registration.
