<PRE>Hi All,
We will be having a hands-on session on topic &quot;Threat Model-as-Code: A
Framework to go from Codified Threat Modeling to Automated Application
Security&quot;.  Abhay presented this framework at Appsec USA in 2018. Please
fill the form to confirm your attendance.

Date: Monday, December 10th | 6:00PM - 8:00PM
Venue: Upgrade Inc, 275 Battery Street, 23rd floor, San Francisco
Form:- <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/JyGH5l7YtOz7PQvS2">https://goo.gl/forms/JyGH5l7YtOz7PQvS2</A>

Talk Description:
Threat Modeling is critical for Product Engineering Team. Yet, even in the
rare event that it&#8217;s performed, its performed without actionable outputs
emerging from the exercise. It is relegated to the status of what a
&#8220;Policy/Best Practice Document&#8221;, which it shouldn&#8217;t be. I believe that
Threat Models are playbooks of Product Security Engineering. I feel that
the best way to do threat modeling is to integrate it into the Software
Development Lifecycle (SDL). In addition, I believe that Threat Models
should produce actionable outputs that can be acted up on by various teams
within the organization. To address this lacuna, I have developed
&#8220;Automaton&#8221; - An Open Source &#8220;Threat Modeling as Code&#8221; framework, that
allows product teams to capture User Stories, Abuser Stories, Threat Models
and Security Test Cases in YAML Files (like Ansible). With the help of Test
Automation Frameworks (in this case, Robot Framework) Automaton allows the
product engineering team to not only capture Threat Models as code, but
also trigger specific security test cases with tools like OWASP ZAP,
BurpSuite, WFuzz, Sublist3r, Nmap and so on. The benefits are three-fold.
One - For teams to use Threat Modeling as a first-class citizen(with code).
Facilitating Iterative and Updated Threat Models and Security Test Cases,
as the product evolves (not a stationary document).
Two - For Threat Modeling to become actionable. Product Teams can use this
Framework to compose &#8220;Recipes&#8221; where User Stories (Functionality) leads to
Abuser Stories (Threat Profiles) which lead to Threat Models (scenarios),
that are used to create Security Test Cases (which kick off certain tools)
based on the Recipes written for the Test Cases.
Three - This approach leads to a convergence of Threat Modeling and
Security Testing, allowing teams to improve both security testing and
threat modeling based on results produced through this framework.

Requirements:
* Computer with WiFi access and 64bit OS
* Python 2.7
* OWASP ZAP 2.7.x
* Docker: Please pull the following images:
   * abhaybhargav/npmaudit
   * abhaybhargav/nodejsscan
* Please git clone: <A HREF="https://github.com/we45/Cut-The-Funds-Frontend">https://github.com/we45/Cut-The-Funds-Frontend</A> and run
`docker-compose up` to run the vulnerable app that we'll be using

Trainer:
Abhay Bhargav

Abhay Bhargav is the Founder of we45, a focused Application Security
Company. Abhay is a builder and breaker of applications. He is the Chief
Architect of &#8220;Orchestron&quot;, a leading Application Vulnerability Correlation
and Orchestration Framework.

He has created some pioneering works in the area of DevSecOps and AppSec
Automation, including the world&#8217;s first hands-on training program on
DevSecOps, focused on Application Security Automation. In addition to his
work in Application Security Automation, he has created &#8220;ThreatPlaybook&#8221;, a
unique open-source framework that marries Threat-Modeling (as-Code) with
Application Security Automation. ThreatPlaybook has been featured in
several industry events and been recently featured in BlackHat USA 2018&#8217;s
Arsenal event. In addition to this, Abhay is active in his research of new
technologies and their impact on Application Security, namely Containers,
Orchestration and Serverless Architectures.

Abhay is a speaker and trainer at major industry events including DEF CON,
BlackHat, OWASP AppSecUSA, EU and AppSecCali. His trainings have been
sold-out events at conferences like AppSecUSA, EU, AppSecDay Melbourne,
CodeBlue (Japan) and so on. He&#8217;s also an author and trainer on Pluralsight.
He writes on IT and IT Security-focused areas in his blog. Abhay is the
author of two international publications &#8220;Secure Java: For Web Application
Development&#8221; and &#8220;PCI Compliance: A Definitive Guide&quot;

Again, Please fill the form to confirm your seat.
