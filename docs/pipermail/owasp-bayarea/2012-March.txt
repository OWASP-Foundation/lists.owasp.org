Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Last Week's Bay Area OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <CB8E2C53.1F0E%teresa-ann-stevens@comcast.net>

Hi Everybody,

Thank you for coming to the first Bay Area OWASP meeting of 2012, last week.
It was a rainy night, but the meeting was well attended, and the
presentations sparked a lot of conversation.

Thank you Astech Consulting and Greg Reber, for hosting the meeting, and a
special thanks to Maritza Geuss (of Astech Consulting) and her family for
doing the yeoman's share of the work, and creating a highly functioning
affair! 

The venue, The Chinese Historical Society, was GREAT, and easy to get to.
The food was wonderful.

John Kinsella presented a discussion on "Rebuilding for the Cloud - How
cloud architecture can improve application security." And, Tin Zaw gave us a
presentation entitled, "Cucumber and Friends ? Tools for Security that
Matters." 

Both presentations are available on the Past Events page at the Bay Area
OWASP page: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Click_here_to_see_Past_Events

Thank you again, Maritza Geuss, Greg Reber, John Kinsella and Tin Zaw

Our next meeting will be on June 13, at Cigital's offices in Santa Clara. We
will send more details as the time gets closer.

See you soon!

Message-ID: <CB8FFE20.23E9%teresa-ann-stevens@comcast.net>

Hi Everybody,

I have heard that some people have tried to join the Bay Area OWASP email
lists, but find that they do not receive any emails. I have also heard that
some emails we send keep being sent repeatedly. Have you or anyone you know
had these problems from the Bay Area OWASP email list?

I am trying to figure out what the problem is. Thanks for your help!

Message-ID: <CAKwNZM1M=nV82K+YVCndzFeyd0GYDz4UsW0fviPHq8QEuOR7jw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Twitter will be holding a security open house event on March 29, 2012 and
we invite all OWASP members to come join us.  Twitter has a strong
commitment for all things security, open source, and community and
currently employs multiple OWASP members.  We'd love to have you come by
and talk about security at Twitter.

Those who were at the last meeting may have heard me make an announcement
for this event, so here's the official blog post with registration links:
http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/03/past-few-months-have-been-busy-for.html

Please don't hesitate to contact me with questions!
