<PRE>All,

First of all, I would like to thank those of you for attending last night's event at PG&amp;E in San Francisco.  We had the best turnout in almost a year and even I met someone from Monterey and another from Salinas, which shows that the meetings are indeed sought after.  One announcement that was overlooked was the upcoming Silicon Valley 2008, San Jose Conference that begins on February 2nd through the 8th.  Along with the 6-day tracks there will be a new 2-day course called Secure Coding in Java/JEE: Developing Defensible Applications on Saturday and Sunday,  February 2-3.  The  SANS Institute Silicon Valley Conference will be held at:

Wyndham San Jose Hotel


1350 North First St


San Jose, 
California 95112


I also promised to announce the annual Cornerstone of Trust Conference on March 6th at The Crowne Plaza in Foster City.  For more information, please refer to:   <A HREF="http://cornerstonesoftrust.com/">http://cornerstonesoftrust.com/</A>

I look forward to seeing you again at the East Bay event.  Have a great weekend!

Robi Papp
San Francisco Chapter
