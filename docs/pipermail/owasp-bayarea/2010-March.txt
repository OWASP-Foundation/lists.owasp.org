Dear all

 

Most of the presentations from our OWASP Bay Area summit held on February
25th have been uploaded here -
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bay_Area#tab=Chapter_Meetings - next to each
speaker's name. 

 

I am still waiting for one more which I will upload once I have it. We are
also working on the videos which require edits to adjust for volume etc but
should be available in a few days. 

 

Thanks again for attending. 

 

Best regards,

 

Mandeep Khera

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Bay Area Hacker's Association announcement
Message-ID: <20100326055815.GP21109@subspacefield.org>

Hey all, moved to the area recently from Austin.

I spoke at OWASP Austin once, and Austin Hacker's Association (AHA)
several times.  Both of them were presentation-oriented, with OWASP
Austin tending towards the "one long talk on web security" format and
AHA tending towards "many small talks on any topic, but mostly
security" format.

I looked around for a presentation-oriented mostly-security org here
and couldn't find one (OWASP is closest but a bit more specialized),
so decided to start a mlist to discuss the idea:

Please consider joining in the discussions.

Cheers,
Travis
