<PRE>There ended up being about 40 at the event, with plenty of room to spare.  The reality is that about half of people will show up when they agree to attend an event like this. It might be worth changing the thresholds for the wait list

</I>&gt;<i> A shame about the wait list.  I work in SF but live in South Bay.  I was thinking of crashing the meeting anyway and using standing room only, but I was advised not to do so on the meetup page.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I think something like 80 people were on the wait list ahead of me, in addition to those that were accepted and confirmed.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> Just wanted to say thanks to those of you that were able to make it to Lending Club's meet up on Tuesday, April 5 2016.  We're in the middle of finalizing the videos so that everyone can share the videos from the event.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> We'll be a hosting a lot more events in the future like this.  This time around, the waitlist feature heavily restricted how many people could attend.  In reality, we had plenty of room and could've fit a lot more, so we'll look at ways of fixing the waitlist to ensure more people can attend.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> See you at the next Lending Club event and expect an updated regarding the Lending Club videos of the talks!
