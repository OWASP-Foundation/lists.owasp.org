Apologies for the mixup last month.  We're trying again...

Bay Area (Hacker's Association|Security Enthusiasts) Meeting!

2nd Sunday of Every Month, 2pm, at Noisebridge, in the main area.

It lasts until it's over.

Our site, including google calendar: http://baha.bitrot.info/

It's for people interested in security, not the more general "make
stuff" sense of the word.

Date of Meeting:
================

This SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY (8 May 2011) at 2pm

Place of Meeting:

https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge

This Month We Present:
======================

Dan Kaminsky

On:

Making Trust Scale:  The Realities of Comodo and DNSSEC

The realities of X.509 reached a fever pitch with the recent compromise of a
Comodo SSL reseller. In this talk, I'll discuss how and why X.509, as a
technology, leads to trust networks that do not scale, and how DNSSEC is in
fact the correct technology to replace it.

About Dan:

Dan Kaminsky is an American security researcher. He formerly worked
for Cisco, Avaya, and IOActive, where he was the Director of
Penetration Testing. He is known among computer security experts for
his work on DNS cache poisoning (also known as "The Kaminsky Bug"),
and for showing that the Sony Rootkit had infected at least 568,200
computers and for his talks at the Black Hat Briefings.

On June 16, 2010, Dan was named by ICANN as one of the Trusted
Community Representatives for the DNSSEC root.

Yes, the SF Chapter has not had a meeting in quite some time, but there have 
been a few in South Bay.

I am actually working to get one scheduled for June and would welcome any 
assistance.  I believe I can get at least 1 presenter, maybe 2.

Hey Guys, 

When is your next meeting?

July 1st 2010 seems a bit inactive? Or is this just old on the website?

Thanks in advance, looking forward to seeing your chapter in June.

Hey Guys, I am thinking that the first meeting of the new Bay Area Chapter will be at 1:00 PM (for a couple of hours) on June 22, in room 1417, 245 Market Street (near Beale St.)

I guess we should have a couple of speakers. Tom, I will count you as one speaker. Sam, can you be another? I think it would be great to have someone speak on IPv6 and Security.

Hi,

I wanted to volunteer to make a presentation on XSS and DOM Based XSS.

Basically it is a summary of the feedback that I got from attending the OWASP Leadership conference and subsequent paper that I wrote with Jim Manico.

Hey Guys, I am thinking that the first meeting of the new Bay Area Chapter
will be at 1:00 PM (for a couple of hours) on June 22, in room 1417, 245
Market Street (near Beale St.)

 

I guess we should have a couple of speakers. Tom, I will count you as one
speaker. Sam, can you be another? I think it would be great to have someone
speak on IPv6 and Security.

 

Thanks,

This is a great idea!  I'd be happy to present about IPv6 and security.  And
I could probably host it at City College San Francisco, too.

Yes, the SF Chapter has not had a meeting in quite some time, but there have
been a few in South Bay.

I am actually working to get one scheduled for June and would welcome any
assistance.  I believe I can get at least 1 presenter, maybe 2.

Is the year wrong? Or is this from last year? Thanks,

Hey Guys, 

When is your next meeting?

July 1st 2010 seems a bit inactive? Or is this just old on the website?

Thanks in advance, looking forward to seeing your chapter in June.
