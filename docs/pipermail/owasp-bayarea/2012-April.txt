Hi Everybody,

 

I have heard that some people have tried to join the Bay Area OWASP
email lists, but find that they do not receive any emails. I have also
heard that some emails we send keep being sent repeatedly. Have you or
anyone you know had these problems from the Bay Area OWASP email list? 

 

I am trying to figure out what the problem is. Thanks for your help!

 

--Teresa

Hi Everybody, 

I just took over the administration of the OWASP Bay Area Chapter email
list, so hopefully, I'll be able to deal with any future email list problems
we have. 

Thanks,
