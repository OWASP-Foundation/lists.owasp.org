Protecting Website Users from Each Other

Brian Shura, Sr. Consultant, AppSec Consulting

 

Abstract:  

Most often the login page or "front door" of a website is built securely and
is difficult for an attacker to break through.  However, web developers
often leave serious holes in web applications after the login, which can
allow one malicious user to access another user's personal information.
This presentation will cover several vulnerabilities frequently found in the
"logged-in" portion of web applications, how to detect these issues, and how
to ensure your applications don't have these security problems.

Making Money the Black Hat Way

Trey Ford, WhiteHat Security 

 

Abstract:  

Forget Cross-Site Scripting. Forget SQL Injection. If you want to make some
serious cash on the Web, these aren't the tools you need.  No expensive toys
to license, ninja coding skillz or all-black wardrobe required.  All you
need is a Web browser, a sharp eye, and a couple black hat tricks.  In this
talk we will be discussing attacks that are legal by the letter, violating
only terms of service (yes that means a locked account, not a lawsuit)

            

Also known as business logic flaws, often these attacks aren't found in
books, rarely covered in the news, and statistics are limits. However, we do
know they are out there and the bad guys have been lining the pockets with
them for years. Security vendors don't like talking about business logic
flaws because their products don't know how to detect them. Most of the
examples we'll cover are only found in online hacker forums and/or stumbled
upon by complete accident.  In this session we will open the hood and
discuss how the professional hackers make real cash- the black hat way

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Silicon Valley Information Systems Audit and
	Control Association (ISACA) Announcements
Message-ID: <mailman.5.1229506952.2281.owasp-bayarea@lists.owasp.org>

Greetings IT Professionals,

 

The Silicon Valley Chapter of the Information Systems Audit and Control
Association (ISACA) would like to remind you that their December Monthly
Meeting will be held this Thursday (December 18, 2008). They have two great
presentations scheduled by representatives of security heavyweights Symantec
and McAfee:

 

The Underground Economy: The Symantec Report on the Underground Economy
examines activity on underground economy servers observed by Symantec
between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008. It includes analysis and discussion
of the goods and services advertised, advertisers participating in the
economy, the servers and channels that host the trading, and a snapshot of
piracy activity observed.

 

Putting Security into Your Virtual World: As virtualization technology grows
in popularity, the big question about security is buzzing: "How will this
technology affect my existing security posture?"  Taking a one-size-fits-all
approach is definitely not the answer. Find out the best way to start
securing your Virtualization environment during this talk from a Principal
Consultant and Trainer at McAfee. 

 

For further details, or to register, go to the Meetings and Events
<http://www.isaca-sv.org/meetings.html>  tab of ISACA-SV website.

 

Lastly, please SAVE THE FOLLOWING DATES -- February 25, 26, and 27, 2009.
The ISACA-SV Conference Committee is hard at work on their 2009 Winter
Conference, a three-day event that will be held at the e-Bay Conference
Center in San Jose. The conference schedule includes a full day of training
on the first day of the conference, followed by presentations and networking
opportunities on the remaining days. The event will cover both Audit and
Security topics. To learn more about this event, see page 4 of the December
Chip <http://www.isaca-sv.org/December2008Chip.pdf> . To volunteer, sponsor
or speak at this event, please send an e-mail to
2009winterconference at isaca-sv.org.  

 

Thanks and Happy Holidays,

Brian Bertacini

 

Volunteer OWASP Chapter Leader
