Thought this might be of interested to some of the folks on the list.

*Hacking Humanitarian Technology Before the Bad Guys Do*

Event:  JIFX-RELIEF Field Exploration
Location:  Camp Roberts, CA
Dates:  August 15-16, 2012

In the last 18 months there have been a steady increase in attacks by
hostile groups against citizens and response organizations utilizing
communications and Internet technologies.  Those attacks include
custom malware targeting activists in Syria, harassment and
infiltration of civil rights monitoring groups in Egypt, and the
murder of citizen reporters in Mexico.

The JIFX-RELIEF Field Explorations are acknowledged to be the premier
venue for creating interoperable civil-military systems for
Humanitarian Assistance / Disaster Response (HA/DR) operations.  This
year's RELIEF experiments will bring together members of the security
community to evaluate the security strengths and weaknesses of several
technologies that are being deployed in hostile environments.

Participants from the security community will have the opportunity to:
* Support the development of emergency and humanitarian technologies
* Meet a variety of groups working in the humanitarian technology space
* Interact with other members of the public and private security community

The security evaluations will take part over two separate days and
security experts are invited to take part in one or both:

*August 15th*:  Tour of the different experiments taking place and
discussions with the owners and operators of those technologies to
provide the security expert's view of the strengths and weaknesses of
the technology.

*August 16th*:  Penetration testing of a set of those technologies as
they to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are attacked in
fielded in hostile environments.

The attached document contains more information on the experiments
that will be taking place and the organizations involved.  If you are
interested in taking part in the security assessment on one or both
days please RSVP to george at roguegenius.com by August 1st.

Thank you for your time and interest in supporting the development of
secure technologies for use in crisis and disaster response
operations.

So suppose you are in software security for a big organization.

You have multiple apps coming in for review and need to decide which
deserve attention, and how much, and in what areas.

You'd normally have many questions you'd ask to decide how much
attention it takes, some of which you don't need to ask, depending on
the application - for example, a mobile app developed by third parties
has different questions than an intranet app developed in-house.

So, if you dump hundreds of questions on devs, they freak out and
may not complete it.

So in the interest of effort reduction, it seems like this could
be an interactive, "wizard"-type questionnaire.

Obviously, it could be relatively easy to implement as a web app that
spits out a report, but isn't too intimidating for devs since it's
interactive and smart about which questions it skips.

So, is there anything like this out there?

If not, is there anyone interested in doing it as an open-source
application?  Seems like it should be pretty easy to knock out if
you pick the right tools for the job.

You could also use Survey Monkey's free surveys (upto 10 questions)
to qualify the application; if it deserves more questions, then you
can sign up for their service.  Would be faster than building an app
for this, IMO.

A while back, I was playing with LimeSurvey (http://www.limesurvey.org/)
for exactly this purpose.  I never went any further than a quick PoC, but
it looked promising.

Simple survey format may not work if you need more than just
yes/no/fill-in types of questions. In some cases network and architecture
diagrams are necessary as well as additional documentation. Information
sensitivity is also an important factor to consider, especially when you
review an app written by a 3d party. Web app in this case would have to be
protected by reliable authentication mechanism.

Given the sensitivity of information normally requested for code reviews I
tend to think Word/Excel document appears to be a much simpler way. I'm
not saying the web app is not a feasible solution, it's just not as simple
as it appears if you really consider all related issues.
