<PRE>I have another question related enforcing browser clients to use HTTPS:
What if you enforced the use of TLS v1.2 on all web servers to ensure that heartbleed, etc. would not be an issue.
Most browsers have updates to support TLS v1.2, but what about those still on TLS v1.1,1.0?
There is no clean error message from the web server for a failed TLS/SSL negotiation. &#160; &quot;Secure Connection Failed&quot; Firefox, blank in some others.
There is no HTTP response either. &#160; &#160; How to notify users that they should upgrade their browers?

I agree. HTTPS/HSTS/Preload are very important pieces of a secure website.

As some colleagues have pointed out-
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Trying <A HREF="https://">https://</A> then going to <A HREF="http://">http://</A> on failure&#160;would not be great either, unless HSTS is enabled.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; With this behavior, anyone on &quot;local network&quot; could easily cause a browser to &quot;downgrade&quot; to port 80 by blocking 443. Once HSTS is prevalent, that might be acceptable... but not today.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(Similar to revocation server&#160;attacks, simple ability to block the connection breaks the security of the feature)

It would be very good if browsers have changed to defaulting to <A HREF="https://">https://</A> on hostnames before trying http. I was not aware that was the case. If it were true, it would almost negate the need for HSTS.


They have not, as far as I can tell. &#160;(Tested on Chrome 46 and Firefox 41)&#160;

+1 and fair, imho.

So unless the user explicitly types in&#160;&quot;<A HREF="http://somesite.com">http://somesite.com</A>&quot;&#160;and that site is not preloaded HSTS and (and the user did not trigger HSTS headers in previous hits) most browsers default to HTTPS.
