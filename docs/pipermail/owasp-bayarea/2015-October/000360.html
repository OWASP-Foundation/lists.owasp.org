It depends on your threat model.

The net-net is:

You and your customers can't accidentally end up using HTTP instead of
HTTPS.

The details are:

That means cookies which you failed to set the &quot;secure&quot; (?!?) flag on
don't accidentally get sent via HTTP.

They don't accidentally send a password or sensitive information over
HTTP via an &quot;unsecure&quot; form, possibly via a redirect or something
where the form action is autogenerated.

You can avoid accidentally sending a login cookie or something in
an unencrypted response.

An active MITM can spoof HTTP/TCP/80 without talking to the real site,
clearly.

A MOTS can only race against the real site which probably sends back a
TCP RST.

Passive attackers are SOL if you don't ever do HTTP/TCP/80.

You can easily splice into HTTP requests via dsniff and whatnot
to insert a fake HSTS - it's harder if they never use HTTP in the
first place and you never allow it.

There's probably a dozen other minor implications and scenarios that
would need to be run through to generate a proper analysis, including
interactions with user controllable content, XSS, CSRF, header
splicing and header injection, but this is all you get for free from
me after 2200 on a worknight. :-)
