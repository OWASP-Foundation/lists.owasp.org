I suppose I didn't consider &quot;accidentally&quot; using HTTP.  Given that I was
considering any mechanism that does not protect against a MITM as flawed, I
still see no benefit, but I do suppose there is a benefit against e.g., the
passive attacker.  Not serving on port 80 does come with a usability cost
though.  Many users will not type in the protocol and will be surprised
when it doesn't work.

Some of the concerns you listed could be mitigated by a well-designed
framework: redirecting all requests to HTTPS won't protect against the data
sent by the user, but it can prevent sending the login cookie in the
response, and your framework can ensure the secure attribute is set on
cookies.
