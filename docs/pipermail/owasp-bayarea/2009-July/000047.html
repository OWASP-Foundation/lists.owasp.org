Detailed Abstracts and Speaker Bios


Development Issues Within AJAX Applications: How to Divert Threats 
AJAX has rapidly emerged as a prominent enabling technology in the movement
to improve the Web as a software platform for business and consumer
applications. Using AJAX development techniques provides software developers
with a wide-open platform for creating innovative new Web (2.0)
applications. The result is a more readily responsive Web environment which
minimizes the &quot;start-stop-start-stop&quot; nature of Web pages, thus increasing
the speed and user-interactivity of Web-enabled services. 


However, the open, malleable nature of Web 2.0 also has an often overlooked
impact on application security that is not necessarily initially visible to
application developers, establishing a relatively easy target for malicious
behavior to compromise applications and overall network security. Various
security issues arise from a number of sources, thus increasing the attack
surface of AJAX applications: client side security controls often replace
server side data validation, thus creating a false sense of security; so do
calls to &quot;hidden&quot; application functionality and URLs; new XML and JavaScript
data models, such as JSON, also enable new attack vectors, like JavaScript
Hijacking; and the open, easy to use nature of so called Mashups often comes
at the price of various security compromises. 

Such threats, however, can be thwarted with the proper implementation of
security testing. This session will address the development issues of AJAX
applications from a security perspective, looking at how today's common web
threats such as SQL injections, Cross Site Scripting, and others are often
magnified in an AJAX environment, and it will also explore new threads, such
as JavaScript Hijacking. Last but not least it also provides Best Practices
for AJAX application developers that are designed to help manage the
security complexities inherent to AJAX development. 


Mastering Session Management
Almost everyone is aware of Cross site Scripting and SQL Injection
vulnerabilities and their impact. Every web application implements session
management techniques to maintain context, but application developers do not
pay a lot of attention to session management because they are usually
managed by the application server. Attacks against sessions can result in
serious compromises and this presentation will cover some of the most common
session management techniques and the attacks that can be launched against
sessions. It will also discuss some of the techniques developers can use to
protect against session attacks.


Building a Corporate Application Security Assessment Program 
The talk will discuss Intuit's experiences in building a corporate
application security assessment program. Areas of discussion will include
tools, processes, and methodologies utilized to conduct effective security
assessments of applications in a large global software development
corporation. 


&gt;<i>From Rivals to BFF: WAF &amp; VA Unite
</I>For years there was a debate in the Web application and data security world
about which approaches are best - black box, white box, SDLC, VA
services/software, Web Application Firewalls (WAF), etc. While it is true
that with a limited budget anything can become competitive - a new copy
machine versus a new coffee machine, the core value propositions of WAF and
VA are distinct and complementary. This presentation will illustrate how
integrating these solutions can enable more secure Web application
development and operations.
