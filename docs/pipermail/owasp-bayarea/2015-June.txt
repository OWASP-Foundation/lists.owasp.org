I'm fine with going to the colleges here in San Jose for meeting space.  Do we have some local contacts I should be checkin in with?  I'm new to the local so I'm still working out the lay of the land.


Enjoy

Hi Donald,

San Jose State is probably the "Best College" in Silicon Valley to start
with. Of course, that?s not being biased in anyway. :P

Engineering Department would be a good start I guess.

Computer Science department / office and see where that goes.

hi All:

+1 for Rosewood as the bartending at Madera is nice, and such a central
location near 280.

I'd love to speak but current employer kinda precludes that.

Hi Arpita,

Based on my understanding there is a San Jose Chapter, a San Francisco
Chapter, and a Bay Area chapter that sort of melds the combined areas.

Bay Area Chapter Leaders
* Michael Coates <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:MichaelCoates>
* Teresa Stevens <mailto:teresa.ann.stevens2009 at gmail.com>
* Cory Scott <mailto:cory at crazypenguin.com>


I think Michael C. is pretty busy working on the Owasp Conference going on
in SF which is coming up soon.

I was hoping we could put on an event in 2nd or 3rd week in July.

Not sure who has submitted a proposed talk. I?m not an official, paying
member so I don?t have that visibility.

-Blake

I'm new to the area and settled in some and ready to get to get into the local chapter work.  I just spoke with Tom Brennan and just need to transfer to the bay area group to make it official.  If anyone wants to go out and about in San Jose to talk to the colleges or try and recruit speakers or new members or just to say hello to some of the local crowd let me know.  There is a defcon group that meets here once a month as well.


Take care,

D

I'm fine with going to the colleges here in San Jose for meeting space.  Do we have some local contacts I should be checkin in with?  I'm new to the local so I'm still working out the lay of the land.

Thanks Blake. I am fairly new member, don't think I am ready yet to present, but would certainly like to be a listener. If we are meeting here around Mountain View, Cupertino or San Jose, I would like to be there.

Hi Arpita,

Based on my understanding there is a San Jose Chapter, a San Francisco Chapter, and a Bay Area chapter that sort of melds the combined areas.

Bay Area Chapter Leaders
*         Michael Coates<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:MichaelCoates>
*         Teresa Stevens<mailto:teresa.ann.stevens2009 at gmail.com>
*         Cory Scott<mailto:cory at crazypenguin.com>


I think Michael C. is pretty busy working on the Owasp Conference going on in SF which is coming up soon.

I was hoping we could put on an event in 2nd or 3rd week in July.

Not sure who has submitted a proposed talk. I'm not an official, paying member so I don't have that visibility.

Hi folks,

If you are looking for a central location then we can host you at Coupa
which is in San Mateo - right at the intersection of 101 and 92. We can
sponsor food and drinks.

I can also look into do this on a recurring basis if you are interested.

Hi All,I have managed Bangalore, India chapter and still participate in their offline?activities. Few things as per my?experience:
1. To encourage more?newbies(mostly university students) to attend we should ?have one basic or newbie level talk2. Encourage talks with demo. i attended three meets but?didn't see any talks having demos3. At the end of the session we should ask for some feedback like what sessions audience might be interested and if anyone from audience?will be interested to take such sessions.4. Always have a backup from regular attendees, incase one of the speakers blackout we can reach out to regulars to ask if they can take a session on decided dates.
i user stand some of these things are a bit time intensive so may be we can add few volunteers and i will be more than happy to help. The motive is to have regular meets and ensure that more and more people participate.

Hi Donald,


San Jose State is probably the "Best College" in Silicon Valley to start with. Of course, that?s not being biased in anyway. :P


Engineering Department would be a good start I guess.


Computer Science department / office and see where that goes.

I'm fine with going to the colleges here in San Jose for meeting space.  Do we have some local contacts I should be checkin in with?  I'm new to the local so I'm still working out the lay of the land.


Enjoy

It's been a bit so we're definitely going to do a social hour in San Francisco (likely in 3 weeks - just finishing up planning).

We have plenty of hosts but need good talks if we want to do a meeting.

It would be great to circle up if someone(s) is will to do a preso or 2.

Maybe a few speed talks on HTML5 / Mobile / Cool Web Hack Demos?

HI Everyone,
I'm currently looking for security opportunities in the appsec space within
San Francisco bay area.  I have an extensive history within the OWASP
community and the appsec space.  Hence, I'm looking for more senior
security roles.

Here's a link to my LinkedIn profile:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/appsecjonathan

If you think I would be a good fit for a role, feel free to reach out
directly to me at my OWASP account.

-Jonathan

Just trying to help... if you want any of this reversed out let me know!

Aloha,
