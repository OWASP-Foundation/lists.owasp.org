Hi Jeff and Dave,
Maybe we can pull stats from the new Pentagon Bug-Bounty program as well.

I like the idea of including BB data.  But remember that BB programs have
their own set of biases.  What is a good investment of time for a BB payout
may not match the types of flaws your adversaries go after.

AppSec Automation and 'Security in DevOps' Workshop April 25 - 26 San Jose,
CA
  JOIN US FOR THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE WORKSHOP ON SECURITY IN DEVOPS

You are in the fast lane. Your products are being delivered in lightning
fast speeds, going from requirement to deployment at a rapid pace. You may
be leveraging DevOps practices like Continuous Integration, Continuous
Deployment and Continuous Delivery, but what stops you is a Continual,
Consistent and a Seamless Application Security process.

Security flaws come in between you and a smooth DevOps lifecycle. They
cause serious problems, in the form of *endless fix iterations, irate
customers, outages, product overruns and multiple vendor management issues* to
name a few. In addition, traditional models of application security such as
an end-of-the-chain activity like a one time Penetration Test often results
in a huge strain on the operating resources and an increase in the mean
time to deployment.

What if there was a way to integrate Security into your DevOps process?
What if *DevOps became SecDevOps?*

Hi!  I found the below announcement valuable.  What would be the correct list to subscribe to for announcements like this?

Are there other resources people would recommend to tap into local application security conferences? (other than meetup.com)
