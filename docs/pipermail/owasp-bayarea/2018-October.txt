Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Women in AppSec workshop at AppSec Cali 2019
Message-ID: <CAM=ttP+0raJ71wfB6AB1iPg+rNmQvRm2+cXURO8EK_5zQhX5rg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi AppSec California Planning Committee team,

It was wonderful finaly getting the opportunity to meet many of you in
person at AppSec USA.

I'm following up from AppSec USA about the opportunity to sponsor @Vandana
to again give her training, after some great feedback from WIA workshop
attendees at AppSec USA.  The verbiage for the talk would be the same as it
was for AppSec USA:
https://appsecus2018.sched.com/event/FhvW/women-in-appsec-hands-on-penetration-testing-training-1-day-training

I know that the CFP deadline is today, but there are other variables
involved (free diversity training possibilities, speaker travels / hotel
accommodation, etc.), with the same workshop description.  I think that
repeating the WIA training at  AppSec Cali could also be a great "train the
trainers" opportunity for myself and others in California and other United
States OWASP chapters (@Vandana is a Bangalore Chapter Leader) to then give
future diversity trainings moving forward, since the workshop has already
proven to be a success.

Please share your thoughts with @Vandana.  Looking forward to discussing
with you!

Best,
Zoe
