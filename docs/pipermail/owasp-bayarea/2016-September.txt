All,

We had a great OWASP Bay Area chapter event last night. Thanks so much to
our speakers and hosts. Info here (
https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-OWASP/events/233591691/)

As was mentioned at the event, we're looking to better formalize chapter
leadership. Currently our only limitation to holding great events is the
time and availability of volunteers to plan and execute - we are fortunate
to have all other items (great attendee interest, funding for the chapter,
places to host, etc)

Are you interested in volunteering 4 hrs per month to advance the local
OWASP chapter? If so, please add your name to the form below. We are going
to meet in person in 2 weeks here in SF to discuss ideas. I'll send the
details to those that express interest.

*OWASP "Bay Area" / I'm not in SF*
One big item will be to better support all areas of the bay with our
chapter. So, if you want to volunteer and you're in the Bay but not in SF,
please do add your name to the list. We'll follow up after our in person
with an hangouts style meeting for the next discussion.

I also see the future of our Bay Area chapter to have leadership teams from
the different parts of the bay to help schedule and plan events. This will
maximize the ability for people to attend regardless of where they are in
the bay and also keep a strong chapter that can work centrally  to leverage
all our resources.


Thanks!

All,

Just wanted to quickly followup on this previous email. We had our first
leadership meeting in San Francisco last night and had a great turnout. The
email below contains the notes and next steps. Just keeping the larger list
looped in - many great things to come!

All,

Thanks so much for attending last night's chapter leadership brainstorming.
Here are the notes from our discussion.

*Our Approach*
*1. Monthly chapter meetings at a set time and place *- this will be the
repeatable great speaker talks. Great ideas about having themes that carry
across multiple months. We want talks to be happening in all three core
locations (SF, Peninsula, East Bay) every month (or every other month at
the latest) for each location. This is thinking big and means we're aiming
for upwards of 36 talks in the bay area per year.
*2. Quarterly big events *- this will vary and could be a workshop,
training, ctf, mentor event, etc. It will be a bigger event though for sure
*3. Videos -* we'd love to record and potentially live stream our events
*4. Ideas - *we have lots of ideas we can experiment within our events such
as time boxed problem solving discussions, lightning talks, arsenal
showcase etc.
*5. Bay Area -* this first leadership discussion was focused on SF. The Bay
Area chapter includes SF, Peninsula and East Bay. We'll repeat these
leadership discussions in Peninsula and East Bay to build project teams for
those areas too.

*Leadership*
To accomplish the above we will have project teams that can operate
autonomously. We'll also have project teams for each of our 3 areas so a
focus on 1 area doesn't starve progress in other areas.

I've committed to provide overall guidance to each of these teams in
regards to previous processes, standard documentation, requirements etc.
Each team should feel empowered to figured out approaches and plans and
make decisions. I'll ask those teams to keep me looped in so we have a
central knowledge point (which would be written down too).

*The project teams*


*San Francisco*
*Speaker Team:* Ben, Luqi, Sam, Will
- Goal is to find great speakers at get them lined up for our chapter
events.

*Quarterly Big Events: *Tom, Rajat, Sam, Ivor, Ben
- Goal is to plan an amazing larger event for each quarter. There's lots of
flexibility here.

*Location Team:* Michael, Anshur
- Goal is to identify a repeatable large space where we can host our
chapter events. Key elements are capacity, repeatable time/date, ease of
access

*Video Team:* Christian
- Goal is to figure out how we could do reasonable quality recording of our
talks and potentially live streaming

*Peninsula (these teams will grow after our peninsula leadership meeting)*
*Speaker Team: *Travis, Bassam
- Goal is to find great speakers at get them lined up for our chapter
events. Note, the speaker teams for S, Peninsula and East Bay should also
communicate to each other so we can have speakers talk at multiple locations

*Location* *Team*: Brendan
- Goal is to identify a repeatable large space where we can host our
chapter events. Key elements are capacity, repeatable time/date, ease of
access

*What's Next*
1. I'll send individual emails to the project teams so the teams have
background info and all email addresses for the participants.
2. Project Teams - start working. You own your area and it will succeed or
fail based on what you do.
3. I will setup similar leadership chats at a Peninsula location and a East
Bay Location
4. We don't have another meeting scheduled yet. We'll get one based on the
above project teams delivering on their respective areas!
5. Ben Hagen will setup a slack channel for leadership to communicate in
real time. Please send emails though for more important progress notes.

Thanks Everyone!
