<PRE>(Posting for Prashant)

Hi All,
I am happy to announce our hands-on meet on 24th January. This is part of
workshop which was conducted by Abhay Bhargav at Defcon 25. Please fill the
below form to reserve your seat.

Topic:- Application Security Automation with OWASP ZAP 2.7.0
Date:- January 24th, 6 pm to 8 pm.
Venue:-  CircleCI 201 Spear Street Suite 12 San Francisco, CA 94105
&lt;<A HREF="https://maps.google.com/?q=201+Spear+Street+Suite+12+San+Francisco,+CA+94105&amp;entry=gmail&amp;source=g">https://maps.google.com/?q=201+Spear+Street+Suite+12+San+Francisco,+CA+94105&amp;entry=gmail&amp;source=g</A>&gt;

Form:- <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/JcW65EcP0pV6xoxB2">https://goo.gl/forms/JcW65EcP0pV6xoxB2</A>

In an age of rapid-release applications, DevOps and small application
security teams, the only way application security can scale, is with
automation. In this workshop, I will introduce some key automation
practices and techniques using Python that students can use in their own
application security programs for quick wins. I will be using OWASP ZAP
2.7.0 to demonstrate some of the key application security automation
concepts, including Parameterized Security Testing with ZAP 2.7.0 and
Custom Scripting with ZAP 2.7.0. The session will be almost entirely
hands-on, with very little theory

Materials:
Laptop with 64bit CPU (Mac/Win/*nix) is good with 8GB+ RAM (Host Machine)
preferred, and atleast 50GB of free HDD
