<PRE>Hi All,
I am happy to announce our hands-on meet on 24th January. This is part of workshop which was conducted by Abhay Bhargav at Defcon 25. Please fill the below form to reserve your seat.

Topic:- Application Security Automation with OWASP ZAP 2.7.0
Date:- January 24th, 6 pm to 8 pm.
Venue:-&#160; CircleCI 201 Spear Street Suite 12 San Francisco, CA 94105

Form:- <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/JcW65EcP0pV6xoxB2">https://goo.gl/forms/JcW65EcP0pV6xoxB2</A>
In an age of rapid-release applications, DevOps and small application security teams, the only way application security can scale, is with automation. In this workshop, I will introduce some key automation practices and techniques using Python that students can use in their own application security programs for quick wins. I will be using OWASP ZAP 2.7.0 to demonstrate some of the key application security automation concepts, including Parameterized Security Testing with ZAP 2.7.0 and Custom Scripting with ZAP 2.7.0. The session will be almost entirely hands-on, with very little theory

Materials:
Laptop with 64bit CPU (Mac/Win/*nix) is good with 8GB+ RAM (Host Machine) preferred, and atleast 50GB of free HDD
