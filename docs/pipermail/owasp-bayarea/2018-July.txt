Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] 23rd july hands-on meet
Message-ID: <CAAf4JyQ9Jgf6s_K48GYe=TzcYG7kN98wpLk4s_on92RZ6CyN=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
Happy to announce our hands-on meet for July. Please fill the form to
register.

Talk:-  OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) 101
Venue: Upgrade Inc, 275 Battery Street, 23rd floor, San Francisco

Registration form:-  https://goo.gl/forms/fPJZrfeXFxrFHgam1

Trainer Bio:-
Shubham Mittal works as CTO at Neotas Ltd. and is an Infosec researcher
with good experience in OSINT, Offensive/Defensive security. He has
spoken/trained/presented at many conferences including Black Hat, DEFCON,
HackMiami, NullCon, c0c0n, and IETF. He is the author of OSINT Framework -
DataSploit and is core organizer of @Recon Village at Defcon. He works from
the command line, uses vi and loves beer.

Talk Description:-
As it is commonly said,  real hacking is 90%  enumeration(reconnaissance)
and 10 % actual attack. Understanding your target is the first step towards
gaining access be it your professional penetration testing or your free
time bug bounty. This will be a basic hands-on session on Open Source
Intelligence from a normal human's perspective. The primary goal of the
session: To gain an understanding of how OSINT works and to understand how
different tools and techniques, how to make notes, mind maps, etc.

You need more but useful information which you can utilize to perform more
targeted attacks. Gathering precise information about your target is
something which is mandatory for every intelligent attack. In this talk, we
will focus on our quick and dirty approach (not sure if it's dirty), which
can be used to grab low hanging fruits as soon as they bloom. We will call
it Intelligent Information Gathering.

Overview of what we will cover during the session:

1. Advanced Search (Beyond Google)
2. Basic OSINT on an organization
3. Discovering Assets
4. OSINT on a Person
        Email ID
        Username
        Name
5. Keeping an Eye on Target (Monitoring/Alerting)
6. Online Anonymity
7. Miscellaneous Fun Learnings

Prerequisites:

1.    Basic knowledge of pen-testing. (so that you understand what exactly
are we trying to do in this session). We don?t mind if you are learning
OSINT for some other purpose, however, we will keep our session around pen
testing.
2. If you want to follow up with the instructor, you should bring your own
laptop with Firefox and Chrome installed.
3. If you wish, you can also load your laptop with Spiderfoot/ DataSploit/
Maltego.

Hi All,
Happy to announce our next Hacker Thursday meetup, Please fill the form to
confirm your seat. Talk details below:

Date:- August 2nd, 2018, 6 to 8 pm

Form:- https://goo.gl/forms/Do28rZcgFAeHmp8F2

Live Stream:- Not confirmed as of now.

Talk Description:
Understanding & Exploiting Common Crypto-Coding Mistakes

Session Description :
Cryptography is difficult to understand and complex to implement. Coding
for cryptographic implementations needs all the more different
considerations and awareness to get it right then the non-crypto
applications. Even the best programmers around the world make common
mistakes while implementing crypto-applications.

For this session we have chosen top 4 mistakes involved in high profile
compromises/breaches in recent times. The session will include hands on lab
with code snippits and heavy use of Openssl for practical demonstration of
correct/incorrect crypto-implementations.

Overview of what we will cover during the session:

1. Casual Random approach :
We ill be understanding what is Randomness and why it is hard to generate
random numbers.
Source of entropy
Which random functions to use and why?
common mistakes while dealing with random number generator
Recent incidents - Tangle key generation for IOTA etc

2. Poor Decisions
Copying crypto code from net
Using defaults
Hard coding sensitive information
Recent Incidents - few attacks on bitcoin wallets to LOGJAM/FREAK in the
past

3. Insecure crypto coding
Side channel attacks
Introduction to with timing attacks
Buffer over reads
Length extension of hashes and address
Recent Incidents - Ethereum address extension to Specter, ticket bleed,
heart-bleed

4. Parameter Reuse
Risk of reusing keys
Risk of reusing nonce or salt
Recent Incidents - Brain wallets hacks

Prerequisites:

1. Basic understanding of programming/cryptography.
2. Each of the sections mentioned above comprises labs in C/C++ and uses
Openssl as swiss army knife of cryptography.
3. We encourage you to bring your own laptops with a Linux/Mac OS/ VM
running on it.
4.The session is equally useful for Programmers, testers and security
professionals
