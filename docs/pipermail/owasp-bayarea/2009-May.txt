Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] TCP/IP over Ham Radio
Message-ID: <4A1C8ADA.20401@strongauth.com>

Some months ago, at an OWASP meeting, I met a gentleman who
spoke to me about his hobby - getting his computer to connect
to the internet over short-wave radio.  I was given a business
card with contact information, but have apparently misplaced
it in a recent move.

Can that person get in touch with me?  There might be an
opportunity to use his expertise to help a non-profit group
with their humanitarian work.

Thanks.

I'm not that person, but years ago this was called "packet radio".? I have a book on it.? One was able to setup PPP connection over Ham bands.

(As I recall, it's pretty slow)
