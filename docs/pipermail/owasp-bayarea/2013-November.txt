All,

Thanks so much to everyone that came out to last night's OWASP Social Hour
hosted by Lending Club. We had good drinks, pizza and lots of great
security discussions with everyone. I look forward to seeing everyone at
the next event!

I also wanted to mention that there's still time to register for OWASP
AppSecUSA http://appsecusa.org/2013/

The event is being held in NYC on Nov 20 & 21. There is an amazing lineup
of talks (http://appsecusa.org/2013/schedule/), tons of attendees
registered, and a variety of other activities happening there too (

I hope to see you there!
