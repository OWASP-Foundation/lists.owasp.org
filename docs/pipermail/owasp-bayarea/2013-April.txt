Hi Ya'll,

I got some new material for a short workshop of SDR/ Gnu-radio and
attacking smartphones wirelessly.

It's in prep / dry run for part of my Blackhat Vegas Class: (Mobile
Hacking II)

Was hoping one [or more] of the local groups could host a spot for me. The
workshop is open to anyone / free. Bring Vmware.

Late May, or sometime in June would work.
