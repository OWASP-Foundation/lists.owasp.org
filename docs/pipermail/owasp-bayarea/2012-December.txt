Join us for an evening about secure development practices for two of the

technical and there will be code. If you're in infosec, please invite
your mobile development friends and colleagues!

Agenda:

5:30 - Social Half-Hour

6:15 - Securing Android Applications, Jesse Burns

7:10 - Break

7:20 - Securing iOS Applications, Blake Turrentine

8:30 - Adjourn

Note: The facility's space is limited, and we do expect to "sell out".
By reserving a ticket, you agree to either attend or let the organizers
know that you will not be attending when/if your plans change so we can
release your ticket to someone on the waiting list. We have good content
that our speakers worked hard to put together and they deserve a full
audience.
