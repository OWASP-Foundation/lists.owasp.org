Detailed abstracts and bios
Presenter: Dr. Chenxi Wang, Principal Analyst, Forrester Group
Topic: Consumerization of enterprises: a security conundrum 
Bio:  Dr. Chenxi Wang is a principal analyst with Forrester. She leads Forrester's research in areas including content security, application security, threats and vulnerability management, and software security. Chenxi brings to Forrester years of sophisticated research experience; her previous experience includes a five-year stint as an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where she published many research papers on network security and distributed systems. 
Previously, Chenxi served as the chief scientist for KSR, a managed security service startup in the San Francisco bay area. Chenxi also serves as an investigative forensics expert for the Federal Trade Commission. She is the recipient of a Critical Infrastructure Protection Fellowship from the Army Research Office and the Samuel Alexander Fellowship of ACM for outstanding Ph.D. thesis research.
Presenter: Collin Jackson, PH.D. Student, Stanford University
Topic: Cross-Site Request Forgery- New Attacks and Defenses 
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a widely exploited web site vulnerability, but none of the three major CSRF defenses are satisfactory and many web sites neglect to prevent login CSRF. In a login CSRF attack, an attacker uses the victim's browser to forge a cross-site request to the honest site's login URL, supplying the attacker's user name and password. This forged request can disrupt the integrity of the session and enable theft of confidential information.
Although the HTTP Referer header could be used as an effective general CSRF defense, our experiments indicate that the header is widely blocked at the network layer due to privacy concerns. Our experimental data shows, however, that the header can be used today as a reliable CSRF defense over HTTPS, which is ideal for login CSRF prevention. For the long term, we propose the Origin header, which provides the security bene?ts of the Referer header while responding to privacy concerns. Additionally, we show that a network attacker can often disrupt session integrity even when the site deploys CSRF defenses, and propose additional defenses against these identity-misbinding attacks.
Bio:  Collin Jackson is a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University. His research focuses on browser vulnerabilities, web authentication, mashups, and web application security.
Presenter: Tom Stracener,  Sr. Security Analyst, Cenzic
Topic: Google Gadget Security
Google Gadgets are HTML and Javascript applications that can be embedded in other web applications or the user's desktop (provided they are using Google Desktop). Gadget code is highly portable and can run on multiple sites or applications with few changes to the underlying code. This talk will focus on gadget security, an area where the current implementation is deeply flawed. We will examine Rsnake's XSS vulnerability in Google gadgets, consider possible attack scenarios, and also look at the reasons why Google chose not to fix this vulnerability. We take a critical look on they ways attackers can exploit the current Gadget implementation when performing attacks. This talk will provide the audience with background information for the upcoming Blackhat 2008 session "Xploiting Google Gadgets: Gmalware and Beyond" by Robert Hansen and Tom Stracener.
Bio:  Tom is the Senior Security Analyst for Cenzic?s CIA Labs. Mr. Stracener was one of the founding members of nCircle Network Security. While at nCircle he served as the head of vulnerability research from 1999 to 2001, developing one of the industry?s first quantitative vulnerability scoring systems, and co-inventing several patented technologies. Mr. Stracener is an experienced security consultant, penetration tester, and vulnerability researcher. One of his patents, ?Interoperability of vulnerability and intrusion detection systems,? was granted by the USPTO in October 2005. Tom has spoken at various conferences including New York Security Conference, ISSA, OWASP, Defcon, and others. 
Presenter:  Neil Daswani, Google 
Topic: How Cybercriminals Steal Money
This talk discusses how we can prevent cybercrime due to the most significant emerging application security vulnerabilities.  Such vulnerabilities are used to commit various types of wide-scale fraud, and attacks based on them steal money right out of people's bank accounts, capture tens of millions of credit card numbers, and aid in the construction of next-generation botnets. 
In the talk, I will present some industry-wide statistics on software security vulnerabilities reported to various databases, and emerging trends in the field of software security.   This talk will then:
* review how attacks such as XSRF (Cross-Site-Request-Forgery), XSSI (Cross-Site-Script-Inclusion), and SQL Injection work,
* discuss their impact on Web 2.0, AJAX, mashup, and social networking applications, 
* outline how to defend against them, and
* describe how to modify a software development process to achieve security.
Finally, the talk will discuss the current state of security education, and provide pointers to certification programs, books, and organizations where you and your colleagues can learn more.
Bio:  Neil Daswani has served in a variety of research , development, teaching, and managerial roles at Google, Stanford University , DoCoMo USA Labs, Yodlee, and Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies). While at Stanford, Neil co-founded the Stanford Center Professional Development (SCPD) Security Certification Program (http://proed.stanford.edu/?security).  His areas of expertise include security, wireless data technology, and peer-to-peer systems. He has published extensively in these areas, frequently gives talks at industry and academic conferences, and has been granted several U.S. patents. He received a Ph.D. and a master's in computer science from Stanford University, and earned a bachelor's in computer science with honors with distinction from Columbia University.  Neil is also the lead author of "Foundations of Security: What Every Programmer Needs To Know" (published by Apress; ISBN 1590597842; http://tinyurl.com/33xs6g )
