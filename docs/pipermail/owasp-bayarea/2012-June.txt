Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Bay Area OWASP Meeting - June 14
Message-ID: <CBF8472E.85E2%teresa-ann-stevens@comcast.net>

Hi Everybody,

Cigital and Symantec are hosting the next Bay Area OWASP Chapter meeting.
The meeting will occur this Thursday, June 14th and begin at 6:00 PM. The
meeting will be hosted in the Symantec main cafeteria in Mountain View at
the following address:

Symantec
Main Cafeteria, Building E
350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043

A map is attached. 

The speakers are AJ Dexter and Carl Schwarcz.

* AJ will speak about Mobile Apps and Mobile Payments Infrastructure
* Carl will speak about BSIMM ? the Build Software In Maturity Model. This
is an open source tool, developed by Cigital and Fortify, by which companies
can measure their secure development maturity level based on data from peer
companies.  The idea is to collect data from as many companies as possible
to advance a collective understanding about how secure development is being
done.
Food and drinks will be provided!

Please respond to me at my email address above, if you plan to attend.

See you there!

Teresa,
