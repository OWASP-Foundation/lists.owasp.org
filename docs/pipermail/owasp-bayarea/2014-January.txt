Message-ID: <CAKA9LHx-5XqmsygB9FL4pG-3iHj++hMbeqoAw0sMp=KcwRX2wA@mail.gmail.com>

Bay Area OWASP,

I'd like to put out a request for speakers. Throughout 2014 the OWASP Bay
Area chapter will hold a variety of chapter meetings and also social hour
networking events. At the chapter meetings we will have two 1 hour
presentations on current and interesting application security topics.

Submit your topic
OWASP Bay Area Chapter - Speaker
Submission<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/forms/d/1ImmfY5KtSILjIym1uToOzSmT2Xv58bVzfxUPDAAn9-c/viewform>

If you are considering submitting please go ahead and do so. We can chat
more to work through any questions.

If you have any comments on the form itself please send those my way. This
isn't intended to be an overly formal process, it's just easier to get all
the information

Good catch. Fixed.

We do have a thriving OWASP Mexico chapter, but this event will be in San
Jose, California.

Subject: [Owasp-bayarea] Free OWASP Training and Happy Hour in SF on Feb 24
Message-ID: <CAA_HhVLSmaFYUrtnxWDiP0x=P-fjApVEN4UTg1=Y0XpyCeubuw@mail.gmail.com>

All -

Please join us for a free security boot camp followed by an OWASP Happy
Hour - details on time and location below!

#################

OWASP is hosting a special FREE security boot camp for all RSA attendees
and local developers. The training is recommended for developers who want
to learn more about securing their code as well as security professionals
who want to become acquainted with the latest web vulnerabilities.

*WHAT: *

Presented by Jim Manico and Eoin Keary, this intensive boot camp focuses on
the most common web application security problems, including aspects of
both the OWASP Top Ten and the MITRE Top 25. The course will introduce and
demonstrate application assessment techniques, illustrating how application
vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really understand how to avoid
introducing such vulnerabilities in their code and understand fixes.

*WHEN: *

Monday, Feb. 24, 2014
2pm-5pm

*WHERE: *

Jillian's Billiards Club of San Francisco
175 Fourth Street, San Francisco, CA 94103
(Across the street from Moscone Center where RSA is being held.)

The boot camp will be followed by an open Happy Hour sponsored by the Bay
Area OWASP Chapter from 5pm-7pm, also at Jillian's.

*COST: *

The training is a FREE service of OWASP, open to to the public -- all RSA
attendees and anyone interested in securing their code.

Pre-registration is recommended to guarantee a spot in the Free Training,
but we will accept walk ins based on available space. The Happy Hour is
open to the public and no registration is required. To register for
training, visit:
