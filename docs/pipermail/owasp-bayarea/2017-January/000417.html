Hi everyone,

Happy new year to all.

Just to let you know that we've put out a new version of our Android
library implementing the FIDO U2F protocol with JS 1.1 API support:

<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/skce/files/v2-Build152/android">https://sourceforge.net/projects/skce/files/v2-Build152/android</A>

You can find the README contents posted below.  Enjoy.

StrongAuth Android U2F Library - from StrongAuth, Inc.
-----------------------------------------------------

This is Build 159 of the StrongAuth Android U2F Library (SAUL)
with a Sample Client App to test with the 2.0 release (Build 152)
of the CryptoEngine (StrongAuth's FIDO Certified U2F Server).

This release of the Android library has the following features:

- It is different from Build 125 in that the current version is
     refactored to function as a library, for inclusion in other apps,
     for mobile-app development using an Android device as a FIDO U2F
     Authenticator;
- It uses the AndroidKeystore, and has thus been written to work
     with Android 6.0 (API level 23 - Marshmallow) or greater;
- If the device has a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) - such
     as the Nexus 5x or Next 6P, the library will use the hardware-
     backed TEE to generate and store the FIDO keys;
- It still uses a TEST software key for Attestation.  As such,the
     Library should not be used in Production environments (yet).
     However, it is perfectly suitable to start pilots or designing
     applications to use this Library.  StrongAuth is committed to
     continuing its development to make it production-ready.

The Library has a Sample Android App to demonstrate its use.  The
sample app:

- Can communicate with your &quot;Relying Party&quot; application server
     to simulate a business application which is FIDO-enabled;
- This project folder also has a sample Server-Side JEE application
     with a Servlet demonstrating interaction with the Android app
     and the CryptoEngine FIDO server (see the PDF presentation in
     this folder for an overview of the architecture). The server-
     side application was tested on Glassfish 4.x using JDK8U112;
- If you are testing with your own instance of CryptoEngine in your
     environment, you must import your CryptoEngine's TLS certificate
     into the cacerts.bks truststore in the Library's raw resources
     folder before building the app for use;
- It has been tested with a Nexus 5 Emulator in the Android Studio
     (on a Centos Linux 7.0) desktop with JDK 8 Update 72, as well as
      a Nexus 6P hardware device;
- It requires the following JAR files to build (place them in the
     SampleAndroidU2FApp/fidou2ftoken/libs folder before building):

-rw-rw-r--. 1 anoor emp 2716822 Feb 18 20:44 core-1.54.0.0.jar
-rw-rw-r--. 1 anoor emp 1320088 Feb 18 20:44 prov-1.54.0.0.jar

- We assume you are comfortable using Android Studio to build the
     source into executable JARs, and testing with an emulator; if
     not, please post questions on the wiki in this project's site.
