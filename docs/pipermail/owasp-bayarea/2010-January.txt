Approaches to Quantitative Risk Analysis for Web Applications



Abstract: Various methods exist for performing risk analysis for web
applications. Quantitative risk analysis models are often regarded as
vulnerability scoring systems as they give a numeric score for vulnerability
risk. Performing actionable risk analysis require more than a spreadsheet or
formulas, it requires sound principles that inform action. This presentation
will focus on presenting core metrics for performing risk analysis as well
as several key principles that should be the foundation of any application
risk management program.

Speaker Bio: Lars Ewe, Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of
Engineering for Cenzic
Lars is a technology executive with broad background in (web) application
development and security, middleware infrastructure, software development
and application/system manageability technologies. Throughout his career
Lars has held key positions in engineering, product management/marketing,
and sales in a variety of different markets. Prior to Cenzic, Lars was
software development director at Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., responsible
for AMD's overall systems manageability and related security strategy and
all related engineering efforts.

Profile of a Hacker vs. Traditional Security Wisdom

Abstract: The Verizon Data Security Report highlights the source and
motivation of many high profile data security breaches.  What's not
surprising is that most of these security breaches are the result of common
web application vulnerabilities being exploited.  This informative
discussion will highlight WhiteHat Security's research regarding the

First of all, a big thanks to the organizers of another successful OWASP meeting yesterday, that was a great one with lots of great info (even though we ran out of sandwiches ;-).

After Arian's presentation last night, Brian mentioned that the slides would be posted on the OWASP web site.  I am having some trouble finding the slides (and the official "OWASP Bay Area" site).  Anyone know where the slides live?
