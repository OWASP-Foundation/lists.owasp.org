<PRE>Hello everyone, I figured I'd extend my search (just one time) to this
email distribution.

I'm looking for a Security Engineer with a strong background in Application
Security for my team at Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto. The position can
work out of East Bay as well (Newark) if that commute is easier.
Telecommuting is not an option.

If you daydream about the OWASP Top 10 and want to work in an awesome
Silicon Valley healthcare IT environment, I would really like to hear from
you. 5-7 years experience in this field is the minimum baseline we are
considering candidates at. Soft skills are just as important for this role
as are technical chops, as it will interact heavily with other IT teams and
upper management. We have excellent benefits. And being part of the
Stanford &quot;ecosystem&quot; of organizations, there are other unique benefits you
won't find elsewhere.

The job title will almost likely change to an engineer title (versus
Architect), but most of what I'm interviewing for can be reviewed in this
req: <A HREF="http://www.stanfordhealthcarecareers.com/job/job_info/28675/E">http://www.stanfordhealthcarecareers.com/job/job_info/28675/E</A>

Please feel free to forward this to connections that may be able to
recommend solid candidates as well. Have them contact me directly.
Realistically you must already be local to the Bay Area to be fast-tracked
into consideration for the position.

Thanks!
Noah Chamberlain
