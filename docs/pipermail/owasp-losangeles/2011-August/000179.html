Our second presentation is a remote presentation by Security
Innovation about TeamMentor and eLearning for OWASP. It is related to
OWASP Exams Project.

The OWASP Exams project will establish the model by which the OWASP
community can create and distribute CC-licensed exams for use by
educators. The purpose of the exams is to improve the effectiveness of
OWASP training through the use of exams as a means of measurement and
student progress tracking. The project will include creation of a set
of CC-licensed exams, a model for exam usage, and a roadmap for future
exam creation.
