Message-ID: <CAOKxZLiyv3RK8B1EQ1Msj+_pO8Muexu3D4pZgbd=WSuYAftTvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP members,

Cassio Goldschmidt founded OWASP Los Angeles chapter in 2008 and since
has served as chapter leader, board member and AppSec 2010 co-chair.
Cassio has decided to step down from LA board. We thank him for his
contributions and wish him the best. He will surely be missed.

To fill Cassio's shoes (and big ones at that), we invited Kelly
FitzGerald and Stuart Schwartz to join LA board as board members.
Kelly and Stu are no strangers to LA chapter. In fact, they, along
with Edward Bonver, were instrumental in founding of LA chapter. They
are experienced software security professionals who currently work at
Symantec, our host for monthly meetings. Please extend warm welcome to
Kelly and Stu.

On behalf of Kelly, Stu, Edward, Richard and many volunteers, enjoy a
safe summer. See you soon!

Tin

Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] Web Application Scanner benchmarks

Here is great comparison of web application scanners.

It is very interesting to see how well some of the cheap (burp) and free
(w3af, Arachni, Zap) scanners performed against heavyweights like
Webinspect and AppScan in certain categories.
