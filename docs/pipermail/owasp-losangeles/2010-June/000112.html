<PRE>Dear OWASP Friends,

I wanted to share with you exciting things that we are working on at
OWASP Los Angeles.

Our July meeting will be on July 21st at Symantec. Our speaker is Samy
Kamkar, perhaps best known for Samy worm on MySpace. His talk has a
rather racy title -- &quot;How I Met Your Girlfriend&quot;. He will present an
entirely new class of web attacks in order to meet your girlfriend, or
at least the user in front of the computer.

RSVP will soon be open at <A HREF="http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/.">http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/.</A>

We are happy to announce that AppSec USA conference, to be held at UC
Irvine from September 7-10, is open for registration. Early
registration discount is available until July 15. Please register
through our brand new website below.

Even better, there is a way to participate at the conference free of
charge. Please volunteer on September 9 and 10, and you will be
attending some sessions of the conference while helping others out at
some sessions. And, you will be invited to the VIP party, exclusively
for speakers, presenters and volunteers. Please let me know if you are
interested.

Our August speaker is Jelena Mirkovic, Research Scientist at USC's
Information Sciences Institute. Our September meeting will be a joint
meeting with ISSA LA chapter. I am open for ideas for October,
November and December meetings, as well as a possible
Christmas/holiday party.

Let's make this summer a blast!
