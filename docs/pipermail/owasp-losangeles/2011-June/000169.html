Topic: Gray, the new Black: Gray-Box Web Vulnerability Testing

Penetration testers who use only black-box tools are destined to lose
to attackers who are willing to spend more time or effort looking for
vulnerabilities. Defenders need to make use of one of the few natural
advantages at their disposal: ready access to the system they&#8217;re
trying to protect.

In this talk Brian will discuss gray-box vulnerability testing
techniques that expose web application internals so that testers
understand what an application is doing and can spot vulnerabilities
faster. The tool observes the program while it executes. It reveals
attack surface, points out vulnerable program behavior, opens up a
code-level view of the application, and allows a tester to understand
information flow inside the program.

Speaker: Brian Chess

Brian Chess is a founder of Fortify Software, an HP company, and
serves as Fortify&#8217;s Chief Scientist, where his work focuses on
practical methods for creating secure systems. His book, Secure
Programming with Static Analysis, shows how static source code
analysis is an indispensable tool for getting security right.

Brian holds a Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of
California at Santa Cruz, where he studied the application of static
analysis to the problem of finding security-relevant defects in source
code. Before settling on security, Brian spent a decade in Silicon
Valley working at huge companies and small startups. He has done
research on a broad set of topics, ranging from integrated circuit
design all the way to delivering software as a service.
