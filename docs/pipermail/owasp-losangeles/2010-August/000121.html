<PRE>Dear OWASP friends,

Our friends at ISACA Los Angeles chapter shares the following with you.

Please see their website, <A HREF="http://www.isacala.org/,">http://www.isacala.org/,</A> for registration information.

Thank you.


=====================
The Information Systems Audit and Control Association's (ISACA) Los
Angeles Chapter's and HTCIA&#8217;s next Meeting will be held on Tuesday,
September 14, 2010, at Monterey Hill Restaurant.

PRE-DINNER MEETING TOPIC:
Leveraging COBIT: Beyond IT - Malcolm McKee, Founder and Chief
Executive Officer, Trango Advisory
                                                   - Wayne Hackelton,
President and Chief Operating Officer, Trango Advisory

3:30pm to 5:00pm - ABOUT THE PRE-MEETING TOPIC

Join us for an interactive discussion on the critical role COBIT plays
outside of the IT department with experts Malcolm McKee and Wayne
Hackelton from Trango Advisory. In an era where the value of every
department is questioned, now more than ever IT departments must
identify their priorities, focus their activities, and communicate
their performance. Discussions will center on how IT directors can
leverage their compliance with the COBIT framework outside of the IT
department.

DINNER MEETING TOPIC:
Cloud Computing and Security &#8211; Dr. Eugene Schulz, CISM, CISSP, GSLC,
CTO &#8211; Emagined Security

5:30pm to 8:30pm - ABOUT THE TOPIC

Cloud computing services provide dynamically scalable and often
virtualized resources as a service over the Internet on an as-needed
basis. Users do not have to know how the services and resources work,
nor do cloud customer organizations have to set up and control
technology infrastructures needed to support cloud services. Although
cloud computing offers substantial cost savings, improved computing
and network performance, and other advantages, cloud computing also
introduces a plethora of security-related risks, many of which are
serious and also presently not well-understood.

Among these risks, data security breaches stand out as one of the
potentially most serious types. What can organizations that use cloud
computing services for data storage do to control data loss-related
risk, how effective are commonly deployed controls, and what is the
cost versus benefit ratio for each control? Additionally, cloud
computing introduces a variety of legal risks of which cloud computing
customers are sometimes unaware. These risks and potential mitigation
measures will also be discussed.
