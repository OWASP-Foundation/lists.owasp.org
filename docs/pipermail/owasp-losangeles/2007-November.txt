Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] OWASP San Diego Chapter Launch
Message-ID: <000001c822cd$d318b130$0202a8c0@Laptop>



I would like to invite you to the first San Diego restaurant Chapter Meeting.  We will be holding it on November 28th at a soon to be announced location.  This initial meeting will focus on what OWASP is, the OWASP Top 10 list, the Live CD, and to identify areas of interest to the members.

We hope to have a mixed crowd of technically savvy penetration testers, Directors/Managers of Information Security, and people interested in becoming more knowledgeable in the field of Web Application Security Testing.

We are looking to potentially have this event in the early evening (6-7:30) at a restraunt or other catered event, thus if you are interested in attending please contact jeromie at comsecinc.com and we'll make sure to get you on the RSVP list.

Please help us spread the word and pass this information along to any potentially interested parties.

strategy.

PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

We will provide certificates to the attendees and all classes qualify
