Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] question about OWASP Interceptor 0.9
Message-ID: <d638fb50701181125k209575b8y266ac264024441b7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
It seems that you cannot download Interceptor for some reason. Does anyone
know why. If anyone has the files already I would really appreciate if you
can send them to me.

Thanks

Ali
