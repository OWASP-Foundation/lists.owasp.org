Topic: Building The DEF CON Network, Making A Sandbox For 10,000 Hackers

We will cover on how the DEF CON network team builds a network from
scratch, in three days with very little budget. How this network
evolved, what worked for us, and what didn&#8217;t work over the last ten
years. This network started as an idea, and after acquiring some kick
butt hardware, has allowed us to support several thousand users
concurrently. In addition I will cover the new WPA2 enterprise
deployment, what worked, and what didn&#8217;t, and how the DEF CON team has
made the Rio network rock!

David M. N. Bryan&#160;has 10 years of computer security experience,
including pentesting, consulting, engineering, and administration. As
an active participant in the information security community, he
volunteers at DEF CON, where he designs and implements the firewall
and network for what is said to be the most hostile network
environment in the world. This network allows speakers, press,
vendors, and others to gain access to the Internet, without being
hacked. In his spare time he runs the local DEF CON group, DC612, is
the president of Twincities Makers group, and participates in the
Minneapolis OWASP chapter.
