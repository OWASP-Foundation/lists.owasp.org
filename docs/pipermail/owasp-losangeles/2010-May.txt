Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] May OWASP Meeting -- May 19, 7:30PM at Symantec
Message-ID: <s2h8a6d3de71005061148s426d3635i94889572adfdcf05@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP friends,

I have been quite busy with AppSec conference (www.appsecUSA.org) that
didn't have a chance to send out invitation for our May monthly
meeting.

May monthly speaker is Neil Matatall, Orange County chapter leader and
contributor to OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) project. He will
give a presentation on ESAPI, with emphasis on Java. (If you have Java
friends, please bring them along).

There will be some food (pizza, salads, etc.). Please RSVP here so we
can get accurate head count: http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/

Abstract: The OWASP Top 10 project gives developers a short list of
the most dangerous mistakes they can make when developing web
applications.  The OWASP Enterprise Security API or ESAPI tries to
provide a structure and tools to help mitigate these threats.  In this
talk, I will go over the ESAPI project in general and drill down into
the ESAPI for Java and how this project can help mitigate the Top 10.

Bio: Neil Matatall, B.S., is an information security engineer for AT&T
Interactive.  He has been working in the information security field
for the past 4 years and has been educating others both in house and
at national conferences on security topics ranging from application
security, web security, network security as well as software
engineering and streamlining software development lifecycles.  He is
the Orange County chapter lead for the Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP) and a member of the program committee for the OWASP
National Conference.

Our friends at ISSA also invite us to their May meeting and June
conference. URLs below:
