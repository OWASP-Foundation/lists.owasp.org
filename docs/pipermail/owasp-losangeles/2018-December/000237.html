sources.  Malcolm will also explain the economic principle of efficiency
and how our current approach to information security is not only
economically inefficient but is not adding to the trust we so badly need.
He will also explore the traditional mindset of trading of risk vs
shareholder value.  He will also explore the mindset of controls impact
business velocity.   He will share real world non security related stories
on the approach to controls has shown we can do both and do them well.  He
will also share non security examples of where organizations have made
trade-offs with substantial societal impacts both positive and negative.
He will provide insights from these stories and bring perspectives from
others in the world to draw lessons that that will be valuable to CISOs and
their teams.*Malcolm Harkins is the Chief Security and Trust Officer at
