The OWASP Exams project will establish the model by which the OWASP
community can create and distribute CC-licensed exams for use by
educators. The purpose of the exams is to improve the effectiveness of
OWASP training through the use of exams as a means of measurement and
student progress tracking. The project will include creation of a set
of CC-licensed exams, a model for exam usage, and a roadmap for future
exam creation.
