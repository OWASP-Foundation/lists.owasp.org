Message-ID: <157ecc300904101350l47664728o95ba9b1b0fc9e1f5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Just a reminder that our next meeting will be April 15th, 7:30PM and at the
same bat-location (Symantec Campus: 900 Corporate Pointe, Culver City 90230
- Malibu Conference Room). Dave Campbell (aka DC) will be presenting a talk
about XSS Exploits and Defenses. I've seen this talk and I believe even
veterans will have new things to learn from it.

DC is an infosec veteran and in my opinion one of the most respected OWASP
Chapter Leaders in the world. DC is also the Principal Consultant at
Electric Alchemy.

OWASP LA will be sponsoring pizza around 7:15 - this means free food for
everyone!

Please reply if you plan to attend.

Hope to see you there,
Cassio
