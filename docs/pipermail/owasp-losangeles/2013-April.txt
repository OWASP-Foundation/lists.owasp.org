Top my fellow OWASP friends,

Don?t miss the largest InfoSec gathering in Southern California, coming May
21 at the Universal City Hilton. See an all-star cast of speakers,
including former White House Cyber Security Czar Howard Schmidt, Jim
Manico, Rafal Los, two CISO panels, a Law Enforcement panel, and more, as
they share their knowledge and experiences with us.

Price of registration goes up starting May 1, so don?t delay.
