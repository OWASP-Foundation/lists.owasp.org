Hi Everyone,

Our meetings are back to the 3rd Wednesday of the month, 7:30PM. Our Sept 16
presenter is Marco Morana and the talk is titled "The Rise of Threat
Analysis and the Fall of Compliance, Policies, and Standards in mitigating
Web Application Security Risks". Abstract and bio follows this message.
Meetings are free as usual. Please RSVP so that I can let security create
badges and I can order enough pizza.

I heard the parking lot will start charging for parking even after
hours. hopefully the value of the meeting continues to superseed the value
of parking. :-)

I'll be traveling for several weeks next month and will not be able to
organize the next meeting. Is anyone willing to organize October's meeting?
If we have someone from Symantec at the meeting we should be able to use the
facility otherwise we may need to use another location.

*The Rise of Threat Analysis and the Fall of Compliance, Policies, and
Standards in mitigating Web Application Security Risks*


On August 5th of 2009, Federal prosecutors on Monday charged Albert Gonzales
with the largest case of credit and debit card data theft ever in the United
States: 130 million credit cards numbers by hacking into the systems of
Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as
well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers.
Using a SQL-injection attack, the hackers installed malware on Hannaford
Brothers. Hannaford was PCI compliant at the time they were compromise that
lets question the validity of regulatory compliance frameworks, and
specifically PCI standards as an effective method to reduce data breaches,
identity theft, and the proliferation of credit card fraud. This
presentation will further analyze how status quo security standards, such as
PCI-DSS, as well as other policies, standards, and guidelines truly affect
security risk mitigation efforts against cybercrime based threats. These
traditional efforts will be compared to threat modeling workflows in order
to demonstrate how real risk is mitigated under each scenario.

Cases for financial fraud will be anonymously presented to create a business
case for application threat modeling as a viable methodology to drive
improved application design and security risk mitigation. Threat modeling
concepts will be elaborated in order to prove how application architecture
walkthroughs via threat modeling improve the mitigation of cybercrime
threats. Attacker motives and goals will be presented and incorporated into
attack trees and it will show how attack libraries can be used to
effectively identify application vulnerabilities and devise countermeasures
in web application.

>From the risk analysis perspective, several attacks will be considered and
highlighted, particularly attacks that represent a systemic impact to an
organization or government (such as for example a distributed denial of
service).

Through the presentation of threat modeling scenarios, analyses and
correlations will be drawn from the represented model(s) to attack patterns,
associated and discovered security vulnerabilities, data sources,
application topologies, and possible roles and permissions associated with
the application environment. The purpose of the presentation is to
demonstrate how application threat modeling can be used as part of a nouveau
age form of security risk mitigation and overall application security. Data
flow diagrams and application walkthroughs will enable audience members to
witness how application threat modeling is an evolved form of security
process engineering for improved application design and overall application
security. The presentation will also demonstrate how threat modeling is
capable of delivering critical business functions as well as in mitigating
current and future cyber attacks, such as distributed denial of service,
botnet driven-malware, spear phishing techniques, and more attacks that
ultimately lead to identity and credit card fraud.

>From the point of view of current and future cybercrime risk mitigation,
several different strategies for application threat modeling will be
discussed as related to securing both the web application web and critical
financial infrastructures, such as ATMs. Finally some emphasis will be given
to countermeasures that provide for incident response, intelligence and
forensics capabilities.

Presentation outline, defining all topics that will be covered:

   - Status quo of regulatory compliance in mitigating risk
   - Threat modeling techniques for cybercrime threats
   - Attack tree analysis for attack tree vectors
   - Threat modeling for multi-channel fraud threat scenarios
   - Cyber crime threats and application countermeasures via threat modeling

   - Example of mitigation strategies for cybercrime and application of
   defense in depth for web applications



Any supporting research/tools:

   - Threat models and attack trees
   - Threat model are produced using the Microsoft? threat modeling tool
   - Public available cybercrime data will be presented and correlated

So sorry I couldn't make it to the SAMM presentation - will check to see if
it's on the web.  But this topic (Sept 16th) is a must for me - unless I'm
called out of town of course.  See you there.

Will you cover the PCI DSS "limitations"?  Heartland post-mortem?
