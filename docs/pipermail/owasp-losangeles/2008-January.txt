OWASP Los Angeles:  

This is my first time posting to your organization, but I felt it would be
appropriate:  Our client is an  East Coast based consulting firm and is
looking to build their West Coast practice.  The area of focus is software
security.  A lot of their business will be in the Bay Area, but they will
also be doing business in southern, CA, Canada, and possibly Texas.  They
are looking to hire 3 - 5 candidates at a variety of levels.  I have
attached the job descriptions, but have additional information on each
position.  Please e-mail me with interest or possible referrals.  Thank You.

 

Regards, Michael Bright
