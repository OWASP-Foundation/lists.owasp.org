 JOIN US FORTHE MOST COMPREHENSIVE WORKSHOP ON SECURITY IN DEVOPS

You are in the fast lane. Your products are being delivered in lightning
fast speeds, going from requirement to deployment at a rapid pace. You may
be leveraging DevOps practices like Continuous Integration, Continuous
Deployment
and Continuous Delivery, but what stops you is a Continual, Consistent and
a Seamless Application Security process.

Security flaws come in between you and a smooth DevOps lifecycle. They
cause serious problems, in the form of *endless fix iterations, irate
customers, outages, product overruns and multiple vendor management issues* to
name a few. In addition, traditional models of application security such as
an end-of-the-chain activity like a one time Penetration Test often results
in a huge strain on the operating resources and an increase in the mean
time to deployment.

What if there was a way to integrate Security into your DevOps process?
What if *DevOps became SecDevOps?*

Hi,

we45's SecDevOps workshop is focused around how organizations (that have a
DevOps and Agile footprint) can implement security through customized
penetration testing automation, security in infrastructure as code and so
on.

We will be covering a Custom Automation Security Testing Framework that
will focus on how you can script manual application security testing cases
and integrate with Continuous Integration and your Continuous Delivery
pipeline, which is invaluable when you need to do "continuous security
testing" for your application stack.

These workshops have been very well received, especially because its
hands-on and highly practical in its orientation. We are running a
special *OWASP
Member Discount @ $1000* for registrations on or before 15th of April.

Details of the workshop agenda, trainer profile and details is available
here
