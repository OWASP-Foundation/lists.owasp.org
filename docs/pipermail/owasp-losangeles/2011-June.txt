Topic: Gray, the new Black: Gray-Box Web Vulnerability Testing

Penetration testers who use only black-box tools are destined to lose
to attackers who are willing to spend more time or effort looking for
vulnerabilities. Defenders need to make use of one of the few natural
advantages at their disposal: ready access to the system they?re
trying to protect.

In this talk Brian will discuss gray-box vulnerability testing
techniques that expose web application internals so that testers
understand what an application is doing and can spot vulnerabilities
faster. The tool observes the program while it executes. It reveals
attack surface, points out vulnerable program behavior, opens up a
code-level view of the application, and allows a tester to understand
information flow inside the program.

Speaker: Brian Chess

Brian Chess is a founder of Fortify Software, an HP company, and
serves as Fortify?s Chief Scientist, where his work focuses on
practical methods for creating secure systems. His book, Secure
Programming with Static Analysis, shows how static source code
analysis is an indispensable tool for getting security right.

Brian holds a Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of

I love how the tone of the LA Times article (And Tin's comments,
specifically) contrast with the CNN article.

Kudos to Tin!

I am scratching my head a bit as to why the LA Times didn't call the
attacks spear phishing and implied that Gmail, as a system, was
compromised.

Message-ID: <BANLkTimyUF3E3W87xYQM5xk2i5FMTLJCiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP Friends,

I need a volunteer to man OWASP table at the ISSA Security Summit on
June 15. The person does not need to be at the desk all the time.
There is a chance to attend keynotes and sessions but please be
available at the desk during breaks to promote OWASP, distribute
flyers and answer questions.

More info about the summit is here:
http://www.issa-la.org/2011-security-summit-home-page/

In related news, Cassio Goldschmidt is on a panel discussion and I am
moderating a different panel discussion. Please come and check us out
if you are going to the summit.

Last but not least, we have an excellent speaker on a topic that has
become quite trendy these days -- gray box testing. Please come to the
monthly meeting on June 22.

http://www.owaspLA.org

Cheers!

Dear OWASP friends,

We hope to see many of you at the next OWASP LA meeting on Wednesday
at 7:00PM at Symantec offices in Culver City. As usual, we will have
food, refreshments and after-hour drinks.

We are expecting a good turn out. Please make sure you RSVP so we can
order enough food.

Gray-box testing, while not entirely new, is gaining momentum in
software testing, and it's a good approach for discovering boundaries
in the software -- root causes of vulnerabilities. Brian Chess,
co-founder of Fortify, now part of HP, is not only an industry thought
leader, but a gifted speaker as well. Please bring your developer and
QA friends -- they will be ahead of the technology curve!

Two more incentives for attending.

* We will be drawing a copy of _Secure Programming with Static
Analysis_ book by Brian Chess and Jacob West, autographed by Brian and
Gary McGraw who is the series editor.

* We will submit to ISC2 for your CISSP/CSSLP credits, courtesy of
Mikhael Felker.

I hope to see you on Wednesday!

Tin
