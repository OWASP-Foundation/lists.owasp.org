<PRE>Dear OWASP Friends,

We are very excited to have Bryan Sullivan, a well-known author and
columnist for MSDN magazine, as our speaker for April meeting. The meeting
information is below. Let's make this one of the best meetings for the LA
Chapter.

Please bring your friends, colleagues, ex-colleagues, neighbors, etc.
Unfortunately, pets are not allowed (unless they are service animals).

Thanks to our sponsor, Business Partner Solutions, we will have food. As the
tradition dictates, we will have drinks at BJ's after the meeting.

Thank you!

*Abstract: NoSQL Security*

NoSQL databases are rapidly gaining popularity, especially for use in
distributed, high-availability cloud services. But are we making the same
mistakes with NoSQL in the childhood of the cloud that we made with SQL in
the childhood of the web? This talk will examine some general security
issues that come with emphasizing the Availability aspect of
Consistency/Availability/Partition-tolerance, and we'll also look at some
specific issues with popular NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra.
