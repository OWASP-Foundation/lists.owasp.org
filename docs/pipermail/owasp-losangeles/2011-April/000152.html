<PRE>Dear OWASP Friends,

The following is a message from Jeff Williams, Chairman of the OWASP
Foundation, to the OWASP community. I would like to highlight a couple
of things.

* Let's get out of our comfort zone (of security professionals) and
reach out to other stakeholders that are integral in making and using
secure software. We are reaching out to .Net, Ruby/Rails, SQL and
DevOps communities, and please let me know there are others we should
reach out to.

* Our very own Richard Greenberg is running for the ISSA International
Board of Directors. If you know Richard, he has brought many positive
changes to the OWASP and security communities, locally and nationally.
If you are an ISSA member, or know one, please support him in June
ISSA election.

We are meeting on April 27 with a well-known author/speaker Bryan
Sullivan. I hope to see many of you there. Please bring your friends.

Best,
Tin

Hi!



I'm seeing a lot of interest in OWASP from outside the so-called choir
lately. Some web frameworks (Seam, Microsoft Team Foundation Server,
Lift, Mykonos) have started to publish security information about
their frameworks. Some of their claims are a little, well, aggressive.
 But rather than jump all over them, let&#8217;s encourage these efforts and
help them actually provide the protection they&#8217;re claiming.



I&#8217;d also like to continue you all to reach out to other communities.
Take Richard Greenberg, for example.&#160; He has been very active at OWASP
in California, on the GCC, and helping with the last AppSec
conference.&#160; &#160;Now he&#8217;s running for the ISSA Int&#8217;l Board of Directors
where he&#8217;s planning to help them understand and push for better
application security.&#160; If any of you are ISSA members, please support
his candidacy at issa.org this June!



I encourage everyone to think of new and better ways to reach out to
other groups and figure out how to best help them with application
security.&#160; Thanks!



--Jeff
