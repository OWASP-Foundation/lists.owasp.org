<PRE>Dear OWASPers,

You may have probably heard of Information Security Summit by ISSA LA
Chapter. It is on June 15 at UCLA campus, with pre-conference trainings on
June 13 and 14.

What you may not know is that we, OWASP LA Chapter, are giving away one free
pass to the conference during our April 27 meeting, and another one during
May 25 meeting.

Here are some ground rules for the giveaway.

1. The pass is for the conference on June 15, not valid for the training.
2. You must be present during the drawing at the meeting to win.
3. You must register individually for the meeting (via Eventbrite) by the
noon of the meeting day.
4. It is not transferrable. We will register your name with the conference.
If you cannot make it, please let us know.

The following is the marketing pitch for the conference.

Not just for the information security professional the Summit will build on
our chapter&#8217;s tradition of being the only educational forum in Los Angeles
specifically designed to encourage participation and interaction among three

non-technical decision makers with top-level management responsibility for
information security and compliance with information privacy laws and
regulations, together with their Trusted Advisors.

*Technology Leaders:* CIOs, Technical Managers and other IT professionals
with responsibility for maintaining the IT network and the data it contains.

*Information Systems Security Leaders:* CISOs and other information security
specialists having day-to-day responsibility for ensuring the security of
sensitive information, together with those responsible for auditing systems
security.

*Speakers Include:*

       Marc Maiffret, CTO of eEye Digital
