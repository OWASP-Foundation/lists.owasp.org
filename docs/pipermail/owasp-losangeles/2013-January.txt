Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] OWASP OC Is Meeting This Thursday at 6PM
Message-ID: <CAOryL0z+dZiA_UrJcPqmn6cPrzcLH=kK87jPEQCLv7a7Ba97Kg@mail.gmail.com>

*Topic: Putting your robots to work: security automation at Twitter*
*Presenter: Neil Matatall and Justin Collins
**Summary:*
"With daily code releases and a growing infrastructure, manually reviewing
code changes and protecting against security regressions quickly becomes
impractical. Even when using security tools, whether commercial or open
source, the difficult work of integrating them into the development and
security cycles remains. We need to use an automated approach to push these
tools as close to when the code is written as possible, allowing us to
prevent potential vulnerabilities before they are shipped. We worked with
development, operations, and release teams to create a targeted suite of
tools focused on specific security concerns that are effective and don?t
introduce any noise. This presentation will give an overview of what we?ve
done over the past year, what we have learned along the way, and will
provide advice for anyone else going down this road as well as the
philosophy that guided us along the way."
