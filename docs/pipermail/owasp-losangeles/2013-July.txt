Dear OWASP Friends,

AppSec USA is less than 4 months away from today. In case you haven't
heard, this year AppSec conference is in New York City and it is expected
to be the largest and the best ever! They just announced stellar keynote
speakers such as firewall and security guru Bill Cheswick and Oracle CSO
Mary Ann Davidson. You can read all about it here --
http://appsecusa.org/2013/.

Good news is that you can now register for the conference and support LA
chapter at the same time. Please see the note from the OWASP board below.

For each ticket to AppSec USA that your chapter sells between July 15 and
August 15, your chapter will receive $50 USD.  If a $50 membership is also
purchased (new or renewed) during registration, then your chapter will earn
$70 USD PER ATTENDEE.

When you register, please use the code *Support_LA *in "discount code"
field. Our chapter will benefit.

You know, I just registered for the conference. I know you will too.

See you in New York!
