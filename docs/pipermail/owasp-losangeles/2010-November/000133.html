Subject: [advisory-board-open] New GIAC Cert Development- Web ApplicationDefender
 
Hello,

 

GIAC is starting to build our exam development team for the new GIAC Web
Application Defender (GWEB) Certification!  If you are interested in being
part of this exam's development process and have experience in developing
and securing web applications, we would love to have you on the team!
Please respond with a brief bio of your secure web application experience
by Wednesday, Nov. 24th.

 

We have a need for Question Writers in November, December, January and
February.  You will be paid for your efforts, and may qualify for CMU's
you can use toward a GIAC recertification.  Don't worry if you are new to,
or a little rusty on your question writing skills; we have a wonderful,
brief workshop, updated guidance, and GIAC staff ready to help get you
going.

 

With your reply, please include a brief summary of your availability by
the month/week/etc so we can estimate how many resource hours we will have
available to us. (Other exam development tasks will follow in February
through March or April if you are not available in November through
January, but may have time in February, March and/or April.)

 

Thank you,

 

Emily Sturnick
