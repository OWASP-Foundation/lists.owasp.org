Baking It In: Abuse-Resistant Web Applications

Speakers:

Al Huizenga runs product strategy and management for Mykonos Software,
a company focused on new ways to secure Web Applications from abuse.
Al has 11 years experience managing, releasing, and marketing
Web-based products and technologies in industry leading companies such
as Cognos Inc., Platform Computing, and Panorama Software. He is
fascinated by how the same technology attributes that drive Web
application adoption &#8211; openness, transparency, and ubiquity &#8211; also
represent severe risk to the businesses that use them.

Kyle Adams: As architect and lead developer for Mykonos Software, Kyle
Adams has final responsibility for code quality and technical
excellence. Mr. Adams is graduate of the Rochester Institute of
Technology, earning a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science with a minor
in Criminal Justice. He wrote his first password protection software
at age 10, started hacking incessantly, and was writing his own
encryption software by age 14. An AJAX expert and enthusiast, Mr.
Adams has worked on scores of web application projects as a freelancer
and entrepreneur.

Abstract:

Current solutions for securing Web applications at run-time rely
heavily on signatures to identify and respond to threats. But
signatures have become less effective at detecting threats over time,
and aren&#8217;t sufficient to address the sophisticated abusive behavior
that large, publicly exposed Web applications are subject to,
including page scraping, logic abuse, malicious automation, phishing,
and malware distribution.

The key shortcoming is a lack of application context &#8211; without any
grounding in actual application and user behavior, signature-based
solutions can&#8217;t avoid flagging many false positives. This makes the
information they provide to administrators practically un-actionable.

In response, new approaches are emerging that focus on behavior, not
input signatures. One key trend is to enhance the application code
itself with detection points that provide more transparency into
malicious user behavior. This enables administrators to prevent
application abuse before bad users can establish an attack vector. In
this presentation, we&#8217;ll discuss the merits and challenges of this
approach. We&#8217;ll focus on specific examples, including the OWASP
AppSensor project and the Mykonos Security Appliance.

Stunext Worm

Speaker:

Liam O Murchu, Security Response at Symantec Corporation

Abstract:

Details coming soon. But for now, refer to Wikipedia.

--- Sponsor ---

Mykonos Software approaches Web application security differently. We
understand how Web applications are abused by criminal attackers to
steal data, commit fraud, or use company IP for un-intended tasks.

The Mykonos Security Appliance detects malicious abuse of web
applications before the damage is done. This software solution
profiles the abuse through intelligence gathering and responds to any
abuse in real-time ultimately preventing data theft, fraudulent
behavior and misuse of your Web properties.
