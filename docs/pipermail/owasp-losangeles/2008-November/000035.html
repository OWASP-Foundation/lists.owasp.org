*A new web attack vector: Script Fragmentation*



This presentation will introduce a new web-based attack vector which

utilizes client-side scripting to fragment malicious web content.



This involves distributing web exploits in a asynchronous manner to

evade signature detection. Similar to TCP fragmentation attacks, which

are still an issue in current IDS/IPS products, This attack vector

involves sending any web exploit in fragments and uses the already

existing components within the web browser to reassemble and execute

the exploit.



Our presentation will discuss this attack vector used to evade both

gateway and client side detection. We will show several proof of

concepts containing common readily available web exploits.



*Stephan Chenette* is a Senior Security Researcher who helps lead Websense
Security

Labs working on malcode detection techniques. Mr. Chenette specializes

in research tools ranging from kernel-land sandboxes, to static

analysis scanners. He has released public analyses on various

vulnerabilities and malware. Prior to joining Websense, Stephan was a

security software engineer for 4 years working in research and product

development at eEye Digital Security.
