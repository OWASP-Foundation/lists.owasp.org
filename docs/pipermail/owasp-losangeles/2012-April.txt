Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] OWASP in LA -- April 2012

Dear OWASP Friends,

Three things, real quick.

*1. Hold the Date -- April 25
*
We are planning for 1/2 day conference on April 25 -- calling it a
Mini-Summit -- starting at 3PM at a hotel on the west side (most likely in
Culver City). We have at least 3 speakers and a panel discussion. The event
includes food and beverages and there will be a small fee (no more than
$20) to offset the cost.

Please show us love by registering. Registration will open soon on Meetup.

*2. Participate in Projects
*
OWASP is about projects. Without projects, OWASP wouldn't exist, and
projects need new blood. I would like to encourage your participation in
the projects. There are many projects to choose from (link below) but
 testing, development and code review guides are in urgent need of help.
You don't need to be a coder to contribute.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project

Please see what you can contribute and feel free to reach out to the
project leaders directly, or send me an email if you want an introduction.

*3. Call for Local Speakers
*
We have a lot of security talent in LA area and we would love to hear from
you. Edward Bonver is leading an initiative to have local speakers more
involved and present at OWASP meetings. Please reach out to him at
edward at owasp.org if you're interested.

Let's Spring ahead!

Tin
