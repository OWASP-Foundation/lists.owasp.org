Hi Everyone,

Happy 2009! Our first meeting of the year will be January 28th, 7:30PM. Our
guest speaker, Ben Walther, is one of the co-authors of the recently
published O'Reilly book "Web Security Testing Cookbook" and will be talking
about "Building Security into the Test Organization". For more information
see: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Los_Angeles

A US$5.00 cover will be charged for pizza, which will be served around
7:00PM. Please bring exact change and RSVP.

In addition, I was able to secure two copies of brand new Symantec products
to give away at the end of the meeting. Hope you can make it!

In addition to presenting, I will also make change. Not make change in the
Obama way, but if you don't have exactly $5.

In return, I have a very short quiz for you; please be prepared to explain
your answers. Each correct answer is worth 3 points, redeemable for cash.

   1. What works best in your company: top-down initiatives or ground-up
   interest?
   2. Do you have a central test organization, or a test team for each
   project?
   3. Do you have a central security group, or a few security gurus
   distributed on each project?

Thanks, and see you tomorrow,
-Ben
