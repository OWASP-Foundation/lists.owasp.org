Hi Everyone,

Just a reminder that our next meeting will be June 24, 7:30PM. We are back
to the usual conference room at Symantec. Please send me a message if you
intend to come so that I can request badges ahead of time. Below is a
summary of our next presentation, which I personally think will be very
interesting:

*Information Warfare: Past, Present and Future*
Information warfare is the composite use of psychological operations
(PYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), operational security (OPSEC), computer
network operations (CNO), and electronic warfare (EW) to control and disrupt
information flow. Recently, interest in information war technologies,
techniques and policy issues have increased, especially in the domain of
CNO. Increased scrutiny over network operations is both legitimate and
valid, as global commerce and military powers are integrated and dependent
on the Internet for critical operations. This presentation will describe the
five domains of information warfare, the past use of information warfare in
the Gulf war and recent Cyber attacks on the Eastern European countries of
Georgia and Estonia. Information will be presented on possible new
directions of information warfare.

*Mikhael Felker*, CISSP-ISSEP has worked in a variety of roles including
instructor, engineer, and researcher. He is currently employed by The
Aerospace Corporation in the Information Assurance Technology Department,
supporting Information Assurance (IA) for satellite systems. He is also an
Instructor within the Computer & Information Systems Division at UCLA
Extension, teaching a course in networking. Actively involved in the Los
Angeles security community, he is the Education Director for Los Angeles
Chapter of Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), member and
speaker of Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), and
former Defense Sector Coordinator for InfraGard. Mikhael has published
articles in IEEE Security & Privacy, the ISSA Journal, Information Systems
Control Journal, and SecurityFocus. He is a recipient of the Scholarship for
Service Program (SFS) Fellowship, sponsored by the National Science
Foundation and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Mikhael completed his
graduate work at Carnegie Mellon University with a Master's in Information
Security Policy & Management and Bachelor's at UCLA in Computer Science. He
holds over 10 certifications in IT and Security.

satellite uplink frequencies to various news service agencies and the
increase use of TOR by Iranians to bypass Net sensors, this talk is for you!
