*Topic: Deep Dive into Web Application Scanning*
*Speakers:*

*Brian Robison*, is the Senior Product Manager for McAfee's enterprise
vulnerability management solutions. Driven by a relentless desire for
customer satisfaction and leveraging over a decade of experience in security
and risk management, he is primarily responsible for the strategy and
roadmap of McAfee's enterprise vulnerability management offerings, including
the web application assessment module. Brian joined McAfee in 2005 as a
Technical Marketing Engineer focusing on McAfee's endpoint security products
before serving as the Product Manager for McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 4.0.

*Sven Schrecker* joined McAfee in 2006 as part of the Preventsys
acquisition. He has worked extensively on the integration of Risk &
Compliance products into McAfee's ePolicy Orchestrator product. Most
recently, he directed the efforts on the total revamp of the Web Assessment
Engine for McAfee Vulnerability Manager (formerly known as Foundstone). He
is currently architecting cloud-based security technologies.
 *
**Abstract:*

Web applications have exploded to become the point of entry for hackers
wanting to do harm. Knowing how and where web applications are vulnerable is
key to sustaining goodwill and ensuring a positive experience for those who
rely on those applications. Learn tips and techniques for effectively
scanning web applications to keep them safe and secure. Hear about best
practices from other McAfee customers for web application scanning.

This is great!  Thanks for sharing.  Will be icebreaker for Atlanta January
meeting where we always do a run down of OWASP projects/ tools/ news to kick
off a new year.  

 

P.S - Nice job on whoever got the GuitarHero models to abide by the AppSec
script.  Just saying...

Dear OWASP Friends,

I wanted to share with you what we are working on for 2011.

* Maintain the momentum -- monthly meetings with live presentations
* Bring more people to our meetings -- we want to have the room full
* Reach out to developer communities -- .net, Ruby and Java local
communities
* Start University Chapters with local universities
* Participate at OWASP Global Committees
* OWASP Training Days on June 13 & 14, before ISSA LA Summit
* OWASP Track at ISSA LA Summit on June 15
* Joint dinner meetings with ISSA LA in March and September
* Possible AppSec California 2012

In addition, *we are moving our meetings to the fourth Wednesday of the
month*. The first meeting in 2011 will be on January 26 at Symantec. Samy
Kamkar will talk about Evercookie.

While Cassio, Richard and myself are committed, we can't achieve all of
these alone. Your help is needed. Please let us know if you wish to help us
is any of these efforts.

Happy and Safe Holidays!
