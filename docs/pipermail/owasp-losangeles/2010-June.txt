Dear OWASP Friends,

Our June monthly meeting will be on June 9, 7:30PM at Symantec offices
in Culver City.

The speaker is Brendan Bellina. Brendan is Identity Services Architect
and Manager of Enterprise Middleware Identity Management with
Information Technology Services at University of Southern California.
He will be speaking about Shibboleth
(http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/) implementation at USC. Shibboleth
System is a standards based, open source software package for web
single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries. I will send
out the abstract of the talk as soon as I get it.

Registration is open -- http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/.

We will order some food and accurate head count is appreciated.

We are having this month meeting on the second Wednesday, instead of
the regular third Wednesday, to avoid conflict with ISSA Summit
scheduled on June 16. You can still register for the summit at ISSA LA
website (http://www.issa-la.org/default.aspx).

I hope to see you on the 9th!

Dear OWASP Friends,

I wanted to share with you exciting things that we are working on at
OWASP Los Angeles.

Our July meeting will be on July 21st at Symantec. Our speaker is Samy
Kamkar, perhaps best known for Samy worm on MySpace. His talk has a
rather racy title -- "How I Met Your Girlfriend". He will present an
entirely new class of web attacks in order to meet your girlfriend, or
at least the user in front of the computer.

RSVP will soon be open at http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/.

We are happy to announce that AppSec USA conference, to be held at UC
Irvine from September 7-10, is open for registration. Early
registration discount is available until July 15. Please register
through our brand new website below.

http://www.appsecUSA.org

Even better, there is a way to participate at the conference free of
charge. Please volunteer on September 9 and 10, and you will be
attending some sessions of the conference while helping others out at
some sessions. And, you will be invited to the VIP party, exclusively
for speakers, presenters and volunteers. Please let me know if you are
interested.

Our August speaker is Jelena Mirkovic, Research Scientist at USC's
Information Sciences Institute. Our September meeting will be a joint
meeting with ISSA LA chapter. I am open for ideas for October,
November and December meetings, as well as a possible
Christmas/holiday party.

Let's make this summer a blast!
