<PRE>Dear OWASP friends,

July 31st is the last day to register for AppSec USA conference with
early registration rates. AppSec USA is the premiere web application
security conference in North America by OWASP and our chapter, along
with Orange County chapter, is fortunate enough to host the event.

Please register if you have not already. While you are at it, please
join OWASP as a paid member. It is only $50 year, tax-deductible and
40% of your membership fee stays with the local chapter. If you wish
to volunteer, please email Neil Matatall at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-losangeles">neil at owasp.org.</A>

Please register here: <A HREF="http://www.AppSecUSA.org/reg">http://www.AppSecUSA.org/reg</A>

Our August meeting will be on August 18, 7:00PM (NOT 7:30PM as usual)
at Symantec offices in Culver City. Our speaker is Jelena Mirkovic of
Information Sciences Institute at USC. She will present &quot;The DETER
Project: Scientific, Safe and Simple CyberSecurity Experimentation&quot;.
See details below.

Please RSVP here: <A HREF="http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/">http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/</A>

There will be food, and August meeting is sponsored by Rapid7
(<A HREF="http://www.rapid7.com">http://www.rapid7.com</A>).

Hope to see you in August and September!

The DETER Project
Scientific, Safe and Simple CyberSecurity Experimentation

Description:

As the Internet has become pervasive and our critical infrastructures
inextricably tied to information systems, the risk for economic, social,
and physical disruption due to the insecurities of information systems
has increased immeasurably. Over the past 10 years there has been
increased investment in research on cyber security technologies by U.S.
government agencies and industry.

However, a large-scale deployment of effective security technology
is lacking. One important reason for this deficiency is the
lack of an experimental infrastructure and rigorous scientific
methodologies for development and testing next-generation cyber security
technologies.

To address these shortcomings, the DETER project is creating the
necessary infrastructure - testbeds, tools, and supporting processes - for
national-scale experimentation on emerging security research and
advanced development technologies for cyber defense.

The DETER testbed, funded by the US Department of Homeland
Security and the National Science Foundation  has been operational since
2004. Today it hosts 400+ nodes at USC/ISI and UC
Berkeley, and serves more than 1,200 users and 150
projects from all over the world. It is used for academic research and
teaching, and for testing commercial products. It is accompanied by a
set of experimentation tools and products that make experiment setup,
monitoring and control easy even at large scales. The DETER project has
further made advances in supporting very large scale experiments via
testbed federations, and in supporting safe experimentation with risky
code.

The next generation of the DETER project plans major improvements in
experimental processes to guarantee experimental validity, repeteabiiity
and portability. It further plans improvements in operations to support
an order of magnitude larger experiments than today. Finally, it plans
to build effective community tools for exchange of code, data
and ideas between its users which fosters closer collaborations. This talk
will describe the current state of the DETER testbed, and our new
efforts aimed at advancing the science of cyber security
experimentation.

Speaker:

Dr. Jelena Mirkovic is a Computer Scientist at the USC Information
Sciences Institute, which she joined in 2007. Prior to this she was an
Assistant Professor at the Computer and Information Sciences
Department, University of Delaware, 2003-2007. She received her M.S.
and Ph.D. from UCLA, and her B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering
from the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade,
Serbia.

Her current research is focused on scientific cyber security
experimentation, safe sharing of network data, denial-of-service
attacks and IP spoofing. Her research is funded by the National
Science Foundation, the Department of Homeland Security and the
Infosys Corporation.
