<PRE>For the ones going to Black Hat, here is a good event you may want to
attend.

Cassio

There is still time to register for &quot;Brainstorm 2020:  A Vision for Software
Security&quot; taking place next Tuesday, July 27th at 5:00pm at Black Hat in Las
Vegas.



If you have an idea about how to improve software security then join the
Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode) for this informal
community brainstorm designed to help us define a shared vision for software
security and identify new, forward-thinking ideas about how to make it
happen.



We want you to share your thoughts on two key questions:

                *             What should our vision be for software
security in 2020?

                *             What are your ideas for leap-ahead approaches
to advance software security over the next ten years?



On hand to participate in the brainstorm will be members of SAFECode
including:

                *             Steve Lipner, Senior Director of Security
Engineering Strategy, Microsoft Corporation

                *             Brad Arkin, Director of Product Security and
Privacy, Adobe Systems Incorporated

                *             Gary Phillips, Senior Director, Standard Tools
and Technologies, Symantec Corporation

                *             Janne Uusilehto, Head of Product Security,
Nokia



Attendance is free, but registration is required and space is limited, so
please learn more about the event and register today at

You do have the option to submit your ideas on the questions above when you

your choice. And if you can't attend but have an idea to share, you may
submit it online also at <A HREF="http://www.safecode.org/register.php.">http://www.safecode.org/register.php.</A>
