<PRE> How I Met Your Girlfriend: Entirely New Classes of Web Attacks

Meeting Location
Symantec Corporation
900 Corporate Pointe
Culver City, CA 90230

Please RSVP via Eventbrite (<A HREF="http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/">http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/</A>)

Complimentary dinner will be served.

This meeting is sponsored by Citrix Systems (<A HREF="http://www.lacitrix.com/">http://www.lacitrix.com/</A>).

*Description:*

This includes using HTML5 client-side XSS (without XSS hitting the server!),
and my newly discovered attacks on PHP session hijacking and random numbers
(accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser protocol confusion
(turning a browser into an SMTP server), firewall and NAT penetration via
Javascript (turning your router against you), remote iPhone Google Maps
hijacking (iPhone penetration combined with HTTP man-in-the-middle),
extracting extremely accurate geolocation information from a web browser
(not using IP geolocation), and more.

*Speaker:
Samy Kamkar* is best known for the Samy worm, the first XSS worm, infecting
over one million users on MySpace in less than 24 hours. A co-founder of
Fonality, Inc., an IP PBX company, Samy previously led the development of
all top-level domain name server software and systems for Global Domains
International (.ws), and worked for Penn State University developing
AI-based psychometric personality assessment software.

In the past 10 years, Samy has focused on evolutionary and genetic
algorithmic software development, Voice over IP software development,
automated security and vulnerability research in network security, reverse
engineering, and network gaming. When not strapped behind the Matrix, Samy
can be found stunt driving, getting involved in local community service
projects, and continuing his focus on staying out of jail.
