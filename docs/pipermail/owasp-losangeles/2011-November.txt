Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] Who to report hackers to
Message-ID: <blu0-p4-eas23D1C73E356B2715E913ABBBB20@phx.gbl>


I have evidence showing that tw telecom has hacked into my charter cable router @ home. My husband is an engineer for TW telecom. Recently he was in the orange county region & now is in the Los Angeles market. I have read several stories on the Internet one being Kory Baker story 

http://www.korybakerstory.com/korybakerblogstoryupdates-DEREK-GASSEN-ENGINEER-HACKING-5-18-2011.htm 

My husband and I are living this same story. I believe this was initiated by Miles who is a top executive at tw telecom in southern ca. We are not sure who to go for help. Please google this person who is my next door neighbor.

Registrant
Abraham Lim 
6517 diamondback rd, 
corona Ca,  92880

We believe this guy is the hacker who is hacking for TW Telecom. Our phones have also been compromised several times. All information is greatly appreciated.

Topic: Cucumber and friends: tools for security that matters

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) helps focus software development on
delivering prioritized, verifiable business value by providing a
common vocabulary that spans the divide between Business and
Technology. Cucumber is a widely used tool in Ruby community for
implementing BDD and it executes plain-text functional descriptions as
automated tests. In this talk, Mani and Tin will discuss how Cucumber
and related tools can be used to define and verify security features
that matter in software.

Topic: passw3rd: friends don't let friends store passwords in source code

Passw3rd is a encryption library intended to encrypt and store
passwords outside of source code. This is a problem that has been
solved in hundreds of half-baked ways, or it is a problem that is
often overlooked.
Speaker: Neil Matatall

in development and information security. After graduating from UC
Irvine with a specialization in networks and distributed systems, Neil
entered the workforce and became heavily involved in communities.
