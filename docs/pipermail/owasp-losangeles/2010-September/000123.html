<PRE>Dear OWASP Friends,

Please don't forget that we have a joint meeting with ISSA Los Angeles
chapter this Wednesday.

Please see the following for the announcement from ISSA.

See you on Wednesday!

-- 
Wednesday Evening, September 22, 2010
6:00 PM to 8:30 PM

The Olympic Collection Banquet &amp; Conference Center
11301 West Olympic Boulevard
West Los Angeles, CA 90064
(310) 575-4585

Topic 1:  Secure Coding Practices and Procedures
Speaker 1:  Miguel (Mike) O. Villegas, Director of Information
Security, Newegg, Inc

Abstract 1
Organizations process information over web applications that can be
often classified as sensitive, confidential, or considered
intellectual property. Web Application Firewalls (WAF) provide
protection for business critical data and web applications with an
automated and transparent approach to monitor and protect enterprise
data as it is accessed and transacted through applications. To augment
WAF filtering and vulnerability monitoring, many organizations have
developed or outsource secure code reviews and development.
Information Security at Newegg established their own .NET C# secure
coding standard, train and test our developers on secure coding, and
do their own secure code reviews with WebInspect and manual code
reviews.  They started to develop a web application threat modeling
approach but it is still in its infancy.  This presentation focuses on
the secure coding standard, satisfying PCI requirements for such, and
training / testing of developers in secure coding practices using
OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities as its foundation.

Topic 2: Title: Threat Modeling at Symantec
Speaker 2: Edward Bonver, Principal Software Engineer, Symantec
Research Labs, Office of the CTO, Symantec Corporation

Abstract 2
Threat Modeling is one of the most important security activities that
a development/QA team needs to perform as part of a Security
Development Lifecycle. This activity allows the team to build a
complete security profile of the system being built. Threat Modeling
is not always easy to get going for a team that has little or no
security experience. In this presentation we'll take a look at why
Threat Modeling is so important; we'll explore the process behind it,
and how the process is being implemented and followed across Symantec.
