Message-ID: <fae47e4b0810132023k4a7abee5uc4ccfad1e9921fcc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP LA!

In case you were not able to attend the excellent OWASP AppSec conference in
NY <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference>, you
might like to know all content (videos and slides) are now available online.
The link is https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference.
There were several great talks. I'm also happy to say you had the
opportunity to see them here in our LA meetings before they were featured in
the conference.



Talking about our next meeting, the date will be Oct 29th. I had to move the
meeting to catch some out of town speakers who will come to LA for
Microsoft's PDC.  Stay tuned for more information which will be posted in
our OWASP Los Angeles page <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Los_Angeles> and
sent by email to the list. We may even have more than one speaker this time!
Oh, and did I mention we'll be giving away OWASP books at the meeting too?



Best regards,
Cassio

On the same thread about certifications, here is another opportunity
to receive a valuable certification using the experience you already have.
See below for details.

And since I'm sending two messages in a row about (ISC)2 certifications, I'd
like to remind OWASP has a project to build its own certification program.

The project is doing really well and I personally expect it to be very
successful (disclosure: I'm part of the mailing list and intend to be
reviewer of this project). If you'd like more info, check out
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Certification_Project or
contact James McGovern directly.
