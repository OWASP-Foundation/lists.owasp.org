<PRE>OWASPers,



Our next meeting will be Wednesday November 18, 7:30PM at Symantec Culver
City (900 Corporate Pointe,
90230&lt;<A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=900+corporate+pointe,+90230&amp;sll=33.843379,-118.113809&amp;sspn=0.693488,1.307373&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=900+Corporate+Pointe,+Los+Angeles,+California+90230&amp;ll=33.987673,-118.388972&amp;spn=0.010817,0.020428&amp;z=">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=900+corporate+pointe,+90230&amp;sll=33.843379,-118.113809&amp;sspn=0.693488,1.307373&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=900+Corporate+Pointe,+Los+Angeles,+California+90230&amp;ll=33.987673,-118.388972&amp;spn=0.010817,0.020428&amp;z=</A>&gt;).
Brian Chess &lt;<A HREF="http://www.vantuyl.com/chess/">http://www.vantuyl.com/chess/</A>&gt;, Chief Scientist at
Fortify&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fortify.com/">http://www.fortify.com/</A>&gt;,
will be speaking to us about dynamic analysis and his latest work. He will
also speak about BSIMM &lt;<A HREF="http://www.bsi-mm.com/">http://www.bsi-mm.com/</A>&gt; and his latest findings from
BSIMM Europe, which was just announced early this week.



Brian is a fabulous speaker so I'm expecting a full house. *Please RSVP back
to me at your earliest convenience* so that I can book our large room for
this talk. Details about the talk follow below.



I also would like to take the opportunity to remind everyone about the other
events going on in LA. ISSA will be meeting Nov 18 11:30AM - the topic for
this meeting will be &quot;Content Piracy, BitTorrent and Forensics&quot;.  For more
information see <A HREF="http://www.issa-la.org/Default.aspx?id=1048">http://www.issa-la.org/Default.aspx?id=1048</A>



Hope to see you soon,

Cassio

PS: No pizza this time but if we get enough folks interest, we can do drinks
after.

*Watching Software Run with Brian Chess, Fortify Founder and Chief Scientist
*

Now more than ever before, computer systems are vulnerable because software
is vulnerable. No matter how good programmers get at making secure software,
it will never be perfect&#8212;we will always have to contend with incomplete or
inadequate code. Most efforts at living with bad code have focused on
shoring it up from the outside: limiting network access (firewalls) or
watching for suspicious behavior (intrusion detection). This talk takes a
different perspective: we&#8217;ll look at methods for identifying and blunting
the effects of software shortcomings from the inside by watching the
software run.

Modern languages like Java and C# are good for more than just programmers.
They also provide a wealth of structured information when they execute. We
can apply many same techniques developed for outside-in security, but at a
finer granularity and with much more context. Along the way there is a lot
to talk about: Where web application firewalls excel and where they fall
down. Fuzzing vs. static analysis. The disappointments of both aspect
oriented programming and building security in. Why nobody uses the Java
Security model. Taking your security with you into the cloud. The reason SQL
injection won&#8217;t go away. Revenge of the reference monitor. Why was Twitter&#8217;s
security so bad?

*Brian Chess* is a founder of Fortify Software and serves as Fortify's Chief
Scientist, where his work focuses on practical methods for creating secure
systems. His book, Secure Programming with Static Analysis, shows how static
source code analysis is an indispensable tool for getting security right.
Brian holds a Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of
California at Santa Cruz, where he studied the application of static
analysis to the problem of finding security-relevant defects in source code.
Before settling on security, Brian spent a decade in Silicon Valley working
at huge companies and small startups. He has done research on a broad set of
topics, ranging from integrated circuit design all the way to delivering
software as a service.
