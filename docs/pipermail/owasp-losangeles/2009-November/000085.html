<PRE>Hi Everyone,

Today I have the honor to announce that effective January 1st 2010, Tin Zaw
will be the new chapter leader for OWASP Los Angeles.  Tin is a very
accomplished individual with significant experience in the industry and
solid educational background. For the one who haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of
meeting Tin personally, his bio follows below.



A lot has been done during this year at OWASP LA. The mailing list grew over
168% and we were able to maintain 1 meeting per month with quality speakers
(A complete list of presentations is available on
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Los_Angeles_Previous_Presentations">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Los_Angeles_Previous_Presentations</A>). Talks
were free from sales pitch and we occasionally seeded other organizations
such as OWASP OC and ISSA with our speakers.  Although OWASP LA is not
currently the home of any OWASP project, OWASP projects were represented in
30-40% of topics discussed in our meetings.



To continue this work is not only Tin&#8217;s responsibility but ours as we all
benefit from having a strong chapter. I personally intend to work very close
with Tin during the first couple months and ask all of you to support his
efforts as well.



Please help me welcoming Tin as the new chapter leader!



Sincerely,

Cassio
