Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] OWASP Los Angeles Monthly Tomorrow
Message-ID: <CAOKxZLg8b+H6fqs7j95UDmjXgxA4gdpVOdfgybT27UfD04BxBA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP friends,

We have our chapter's monthly meeting tomorrow and we have 53 people
registered so far. Thank you for your enthusiasm.

We do not hava a formal speaker tomorrow but we will hear our members share
their experience about Black Hat and DEFCON conferences. Mikhael Felker and
Doug Mechaber will share their experiences and we may hear from Yev Avidon
as well. After that, we will have a moderated open session for all of us to
share what they learned and pretty much anything about OWASP and our plans.

As I did not get a chance to go to either BH or DEFCON this year, I am
particularly excited to hear about your experiences. As always, dinner will
be served, and we will head to BJ's afterward, but since we do not have a
sponsor this time, drinks will be on your own.

For accurate head count on dinner, please update your RSVP should your
plans changed. The URL is

Thank you, and see you tomorrow.
