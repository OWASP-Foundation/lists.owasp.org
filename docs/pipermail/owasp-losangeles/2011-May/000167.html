&gt;<i> Calling all speakers!  BSidesLA is being held August 18th &amp; 19th 2011 at Dockweiler Youth Center and Dockweiler State Beach and we want you!  Submit your talk, and share with the local and international security community.  At least half of the talks will be selected from local Southern California speakers, so lets show what we've got!
</I>&gt;<i> What is SecurityBSides?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BSides Los Angeles (<A HREF="http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/36552449/BSidesLosAngeles">http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/36552449/BSidesLosAngeles</A>) is part of what has become a world-wide community of over twenty free community-driven events.  SecurityBSides is an open platform that gives local as well as internationally recognized security experts and industry professionals the opportunity so share ideas, insights, and develop longstanding relationships with others in the community.  It is a rare opportunity to directly connect and create trusted relationships with key members of the community.  Unlike other events where the speaker is rushed in and out, BSides provides a small and intimate environment for the attendees to directly engage the speaker.  Attendees are looking for more than just information, they are looking to make connections they will call upon throughout the rest of the year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are a security professional in Southern California you are encouraged to visit our site and check out the opportunities to participate, speak, and help out!
