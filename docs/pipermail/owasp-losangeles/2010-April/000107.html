Never before has it been so important for our business leaders to learn
about the dangers of cybercrime and what they need to do to protect their
organizations from loss.

We designed the morning of our Information Security Summit to provide
business leaders with the vital information they need to know.

   - What is the cybercrime epidemic all about?
   - What do I need to do to protect my organization?

We hope to feature a keynote address by *Howard Schmidt,*newly appointed
White House Cybersecurity Coordinator, however we cannot yet confirm this.

This year's Summit features Keynote Presentations by

   - *Brian Krebs**, **Award-winning cybersecurity journalist, author of the
   blog KrebsOnSecurity.com*
   - *Ira Winkler,** Internationally known information security speaker and
   author*


Not just for the information security professional, the Summit will build on
last year's tradition of being the single educational forum in Los Angeles
specifically designed to encourage participation and interaction among three
vital information security constituencies:

   - *Business Leaders: CEOs, COOs, CFOs, Managing Partners *and other
   non-technical decision makers with top-level management responsibility for
   information security and for compliance with information privacy laws and
   regulations, together with their Trusted Advisors.
   - *Technology Leaders: CIOs, Technical Managers and other IT
   professionals* with responsibility for maintaining the IT network and the
   data it contains
   - *Information Systems Security Leaders: CISOs and other information
   security specialists* having day-to-day responsibility for ensuring the
   security of sensitive information, together with those responsible for
   auditing systems security.

Early-Bird Pricing!!!
ISSA, OWASP &amp; ISACA Member / Student (prior to April 22nd) $75
ISSA, OWASP &amp; ISACA Member / Student (after April 22nd) $125
non-ISSA Member (see note below*) $150
