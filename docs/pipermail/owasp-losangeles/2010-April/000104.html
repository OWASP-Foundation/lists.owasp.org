<PRE>OK, it's an April fool joke, or at least wishful thinking.

Seriously though, we are recruiting corporate members. Corporate
membership is 100% tax deductible, since OWASP Foundation is a
non-profit. 40% of the donation stays with the local chapter to
support our meeting refreshments, speakers' travel (if necessary),
etc. You can read more about it here
(<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A>). If your organization is a
good candidate to join, please let me know.

Good news though is that we do have a really good presentation this
month, on April 21st, at Symantec offices in Culver City, starting at
usual 7:30PM.&#160;Registration is now open at
<A HREF="http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/.">http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/.</A> I hope to see you there!

Topic:&#160;The intersection of social and technical attacks in Web 2.0 applications

Speakers: Mike Bailey and Mike Murray

Mike Bailey is a senior security researcher at MAD Security and an
application security specialist. While his research spans a wide
variety of domains, it generally focuses on secure web application
development, web application scanning and penetration testing, online
privacy issues, network protocols and services, and how to break them.
 Mike has spoken throughout the country at different security
conferences and shows, including Blackhat DC, Toorcon, Defcon and
others. Aside from coming up with new and interesting ways to break
web and client-side applications, he also puts those attacks into
practice as a penetration tester. Currently, Mike is studying the
intersection of social and technical attacks in Web 2.0 applications.
He publishes his research on the MAD Security blog as well as at
Skeptikal.org.

Mike Murray has spent his entire career in information security and
currently leads the delivery arm of MAD Security (MADSecInc.com).
Mike is a co-founder of InfoSecLeaders.com where he writes and talks
about the skills and strategies for building a long-term career in
information security.  Mike's on security careers have been seen at
major conferences like RSA and Defcon.

All the best,
Tin
