Message-ID: <BANLkTikf9mJ9GqdfZ8hZ3PtT5ym41aKf8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASPers,

It is unfortunate that our original speaker, Adam Shostack of
Microsoft, could not present at our meeting this month.

We do still have a meeting with a live presenter. I hope that the
topic will be of interest to security professionals and software
developers alike. We will have food as usual. Please bring your
developer and QA friends.

The following is the draft of the topic so you can register for the
meeting. We will update  the Wiki page with a more detailed
description once it is available.

Topic is about Automated Detection of Security Flaws in Ruby on Rails
Code (this is a working title and subject to change).

Speaker is Justin Collins. Justin is a Security Engineer at AT&T
Interactive and a PhD candidate in computer Science at UCLA. He wrote
and published Brakeman, security code analyzer for Ruby on Rails,
which is available on GitHub.

Dear OWASP Friends,

Just a little reminder that we have May meeting this Wednesday at 7PM
at Symantec in Culver City. Please register for the event if you have
not already so we can have enough food for everyone.

At most security conferences, we talk about how software sucks without

less, without interfering with how we make software. Please bring your
developer and QA friends.

We are also giving away a free pass to ISSA LA Security Summit, to be
held on UCLA campus on June 15. See below for details.

I hope to see many of you on Wednesday.

Thanks!

Topic: Automated Detection of Security Flaws in Ruby on Rails Code

Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework which is rapidly being
adopted by companies. While Ruby is a very dynamic language, Rails?
adherence to the concept of ?convention over configuration? has made
it possible to create a capable, open source static analysis tool
called ?Brakeman? for finding security vulnerabilities at the source
code level. Hudson ? recently renamed Jenkins ? is a continuous
integration system which can be configured to run and monitor a wide
variety of jobs. This talk will focus on the advantages of using
static analysis for discovering security issues, and demonstrate how
easy it is automatically monitor vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails
applications during all stages of development using Brakeman and
Jenkins.

Speaker: Justin Collins

Justin is a Security Engineer at AT&T Interactive and a PhD candidate
in Computer Science at UCLA. He wrote and published Brakeman, security
code analyzer for Ruby on Rails code, which is available on GitHub.
