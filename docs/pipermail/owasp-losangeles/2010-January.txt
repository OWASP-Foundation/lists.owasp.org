Topic: Do VLANs allow for good application security?

Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are not a new concept, and can
help any organization better control network access. I will present
some of the previous issues identified, what was the root cause, and
how these have been fixed in current technology. In addition we will
talk about how this can help to enhance security in your environment,
and what controls must be in place in order to implement such an
environment. We will also touch on how this can complicate your
application environment, but improve overall security.
I will touch on the controls that need to be reviewed and audited when
working with VMware, VLANs, and web applications, to ensure that these
networks are secure, and what to look for to potentially pass audit
criteria. I will also talk about where and how these controls have
been implemented in order to protect thousands of users while
accessing one of the most hostile networks in the world.

Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] ISSA meeting this month
Message-ID: <157ecc301001040915t68b00044r33d095e57610da0d@mail.gmail.com>

Hapy New Year everyone,

Besides our meeting on Jan 20th, ISSA is also meeting on Jan 20th during
lunch time. The topic is "Meeting the Crisis of Online Bank Theft". One of
the presenters is Stan Stahl, ISSA LA president and a very engaging speaker.

See information below for details.
Cassio



Greetings!
Information Systems Security Association
Los Angeles Chapter
January 2010 Member Meeting Luncheon
The ISSA LA Chapter cordially invites you to the first meeting of 2010.  We
have an exciting and interesting topic that you will enjoy and benefit from
hearing about.
The title is "Meeting the Crisis of Online Bank Theft"

Our speakers are:
Brad Maryman, FBI-Retired, Maryman and Associates
Stan Stahl, PhD, Citadel Information Group, ISSA-LA President

Talk Summary: An accounting clerk in a hospital received an email,
ostensibly from Facebook, inviting her to connect with a friend from junior
high school. She clicked on the link, installing a Trojan on her
workstation. Over the next 10 days, cybercriminals used the information from
the Trojan horse to initiate online banking transactions, stealing $600,000
from the hospital's bank accounts. The FBI estimates that crimes like this
occur every day with over $100,000,000 already stolen by cybercriminals
using a new breed of malware like Zeus. These new attacks bypass traditional
anti-malware defenses and are even defeating 2nd-factor authentication.
Attacks are often targeted, relying on social engineering to install their
payload. We will discuss the challenges faced by businesses doing online
banking and the banks who serve them. We will also discuss a new ISSA-LA
joint initiative with law enforcement and other organizations to help the
community deal with this new threat.

Wednesday, January 20th, 2010
11:30 A.M. to 1:45 P.M.

Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] Would you like to present at local meetings?
Message-ID: <8a6d3de71001231911m3138d403vfbe71ab4023ba157@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP members,

We have been hearing from industry experts, practitioners and thought
leaders about web and security every month. I thought we could learn a
lot from each other too, as we all are security practitioners. I would
like to ask all of you to consider presenting at the local meeting.

As such, Edward Bonver of Symantec has kindly agreed to lead a
presentation called "Threat Modeling -- Theory and Practice". Edward
will lead the presentation with some background on threat modeling and
then will discuss how it is practiced at Symantec. I would like to ask
at least two members to join him in discussing how threat modeling is
practiced at their organizations, best practices and pitfalls. Of
course, no proprietary or private information needs to be disclosed,
this is for pure educational and informational purposes.

This is to be presented for April or June meeting, depending on your
(and Edward's) availability and out-of-town speaker availability.

Please let me know if you are interested in this presentation, or
presenting other topics. Please feel free to spread the word.

Best regards,
Tin
