<PRE>Hi Everyone,

I&#8217;m happy to announce we have two great speakers coming to our OWASP chapter
in the next two months. As you will see, both topics are very exciting but
also very different.

This month *David Bryan* will be talking about *lock picks, bump keys and
hackers*. For the ones who don&#8217;t know David, he is the person responsible
for setting up the official DEFCON conference network, also known as the
world&#8217;s most hostile network environment! David has over 10 years of
computer security experience and currently works for NetSPI doing security
assessments. He also runs the Minneapolis DEFCON group along with his wife.



*Pravir Chandra* will be talking to us in August about the *Software
Assurance Maturity Model* (SAMM - www.opensamm.org). This is a highly
recommended talk for any individual working for any company (big or small)
that is embracing SDL or wants to create a roadmap. Lessons learned from
this talk will assist to create score cards to track the effectiveness of
the program. *Pravir* is the Director of Strategic Services at Fortify, the
author of the book Network Security with Open SSL, a regular contributor of
OWASP projects and the current leader of both CLASP and SAMM. Pravir is also
one of the master minds behind the early stages of Building Security In
Maturity Model (BSIMM).
