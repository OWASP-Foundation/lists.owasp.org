Hi Everyone,



I'm thrilled to announce the list of speakers for our next 3 months. Please
help spread the word!



?    April 15th, 7:30PM:* DC Campbell* will be presenting "Cross Site
Scripting, Exploits and Defenses"

?    May 20th, 7:00PM:* Jeremiah Grossman* will be presenting "Top Ten Web
Hacking Techniques of 2008: "What's possible, not probable"

?    June 24th, 7:30PM:* Mikhael Felker* will be presenting ?Information
Warfare: Past, Present and Future?

 Meetings are free for all. All I need is you to send a confirmation by
email to cassio at owasp.org.  I'm asking this because I frankly think we will
overflow our regular meeting room capacity for some of these talks!



Please check http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Los_Angeles for abstracts and
speaker bios.



Hope to see you on April 15th, May 20th and June 24th!
