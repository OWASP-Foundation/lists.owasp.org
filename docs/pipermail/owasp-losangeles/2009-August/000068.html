<PRE>Everyone,

The note is just to remind everyone Pravir Chandra will be presenting the
Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) at our meeting tomorrow, Thursday
August 20th 7:30PM at Symantec Campus. Meetings are always free, parking is
free and we'll be ordering pizza (also free). Please RSVP to me if you
intend to join.


*The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)*

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) (<A HREF="http://www.opensamm.org">http://www.opensamm.org</A>) is a
flexible and prescriptive framework for building security into a software
development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based models for
security, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their security assurance
program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned
to the specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables
creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure
software development throughout the typical governance, development, and
deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable management within an
organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through iterations of
building a security assurance program. This workshop will introduce the SAMM
framework and walk through useful activities such as assessing an assurance
program, mapping an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and
iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowing, additional case
studies will also be discussed. SAMM is an open and free project and has
recently been added under the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
Foundation.

*Pravir Chandra* is Director of Strategic Services at Fortify Software and
works with clients on software security assurance programs. Pravir is
recognized for his expertise in software security, code analysis, and his
ability to strategically apply technical knowledge. Prior to Fortify, he was
a Principal Consultant affiliated with Cigital and led large software
security programs at Fortune 500 companies. Pravir Co-Founded Secure
Software, Inc. and was Chief Security Architect prior to its acquisition by
Fortify. He recently created and led the Open Software Assurance Maturity
Model (OpenSAMM) project with the OWASP Foundation, leads the OWASP CLASP
project, and also serves as member of the OWASP Global Projects Committee.
Pravir is author of the book Network Security with OpenSSL.
