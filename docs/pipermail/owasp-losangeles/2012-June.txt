Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] OWASP Los Angeles June meeting with Liam O
	Murchu and Flame Malware
Message-ID: <CAOKxZLi=dwLkUUb8dCa1w6nN365cS4wN4tCLubC5pRjBDJdHRA@mail.gmail.com>

June 27, 2012 at 7:00PM. Symantec Offices, Culver City

Please RSVP here: http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/events/65238232/

Flame Malware

The discovery of the Flame malware that targets Middle Eastern
countries, predominantly Iran, has brought politically motivated
threats into the spot light again.

In this talk I will discuss the Flame malware and contrast it with
other politically motivated threats we have seen. I will discuss how
Flame was discovered, what it is capable of and give updates on the
latest analysis. In addition I will talk about the increasing use of
cyber espionage and what that may mean for software developers.

Flame is peculiar in that it was written with a combination of C++,
Lua and sqlite. I will show how the threat uses these technologies and
how that differs from the malware we see every day.

Speaker: Liam O Murchu

Liam O Murchu is a manager of Security Response at Symantec. He has
appeared on CBS 60 Minutes about Stuxnet virus. He has also presented
about Stuxnet at Los Angeles chapters of OWASP and ISSA.
