<PRE>February meeting speaker is Alex Stamos, topic is Cloud Computing
Security. It is an updated talk of the one he presented at OWASP
meeting and ISSA-LA conference last year.

It will be hosted at AT&amp;T Interactive in Glendale. I will send out
directions and (free) parking information. It will be on February 24
(NOT February 17 as usual) because of my travel schedule. I hope this
will give a chance for those on east side of downtown to come to OWASP
meeting.

March meeting will be at Symantec in Culver City. Speaker is Mike
Schrenk, author of &quot;Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers&quot; It will be
on March 17.

I will send out more information as soon as it becomes available.

Best,
Tin
</PRE>
