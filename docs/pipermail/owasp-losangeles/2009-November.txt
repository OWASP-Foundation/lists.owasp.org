*Watching Software Run with Brian Chess, Fortify Founder and Chief Scientist
*

Now more than ever before, computer systems are vulnerable because software
is vulnerable. No matter how good programmers get at making secure software,
it will never be perfect?we will always have to contend with incomplete or
inadequate code. Most efforts at living with bad code have focused on
shoring it up from the outside: limiting network access (firewalls) or
watching for suspicious behavior (intrusion detection). This talk takes a
different perspective: we?ll look at methods for identifying and blunting
the effects of software shortcomings from the inside by watching the
software run.

Modern languages like Java and C# are good for more than just programmers.
They also provide a wealth of structured information when they execute. We
can apply many same techniques developed for outside-in security, but at a
finer granularity and with much more context. Along the way there is a lot
to talk about: Where web application firewalls excel and where they fall
down. Fuzzing vs. static analysis. The disappointments of both aspect
oriented programming and building security in. Why nobody uses the Java
Security model. Taking your security with you into the cloud. The reason SQL
injection won?t go away. Revenge of the reference monitor. Why was Twitter?s
security so bad?

*Brian Chess* is a founder of Fortify Software and serves as Fortify's Chief
Scientist, where his work focuses on practical methods for creating secure
systems. His book, Secure Programming with Static Analysis, shows how static
source code analysis is an indispensable tool for getting security right.
Brian holds a Ph.D. in computer engineering from the University of
California at Santa Cruz, where he studied the application of static
analysis to the problem of finding security-relevant defects in source code.
Before settling on security, Brian spent a decade in Silicon Valley working
at huge companies and small startups. He has done research on a broad set of
topics, ranging from integrated circuit design all the way to delivering
software as a service.

Thought I'd share this with the list; this is a presentation/Q&A by the
Center for Internet Security with PhoneFactor about their discovery of the
SSL/TLS vulnerability. Looks good.

Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] New chapter leader announcement
Message-ID: <157ecc300911221708i1929d934k38517a20c0104eb3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Today I have the honor to announce that effective January 1st 2010, Tin Zaw
will be the new chapter leader for OWASP Los Angeles.  Tin is a very
accomplished individual with significant experience in the industry and
solid educational background. For the one who haven?t had the pleasure of
meeting Tin personally, his bio follows below.



A lot has been done during this year at OWASP LA. The mailing list grew over
168% and we were able to maintain 1 meeting per month with quality speakers
(A complete list of presentations is available on
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Los_Angeles_Previous_Presentations). Talks
were free from sales pitch and we occasionally seeded other organizations
such as OWASP OC and ISSA with our speakers.  Although OWASP LA is not
currently the home of any OWASP project, OWASP projects were represented in
30-40% of topics discussed in our meetings.



To continue this work is not only Tin?s responsibility but ours as we all
benefit from having a strong chapter. I personally intend to work very close
with Tin during the first couple months and ask all of you to support his
efforts as well.



Please help me welcoming Tin as the new chapter leader!



Sincerely,

Cassio
