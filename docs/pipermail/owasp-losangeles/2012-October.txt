Dear OWASP Members,

We will have our October monthly meeting on October 29, Monday to
avoid conflict with OWASP AppSec USA and ISSA International
conferences, as well as with the Halloween. Please hold the date and
make a RSVP here.

Our feature speaker is Dan Tentler. We will have more information
about the talk and his bio but you can read more about him at the URL
below. Our Queen Bee (Kelly) guaranteed that Dan is an awesome
speaker; if not, she may buy you drinks.

See you on the 29th!
