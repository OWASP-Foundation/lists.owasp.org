Subject: [OWASP-LosAngeles] Thinking outside of the password manager box
Message-ID: <mailman.1780.1551438566.16460.owasp-losangeles@lists.owasp.org>

My colleague Linus S?rud at Detectify published an article on his hobby of
hacking password managers and the flaws in the design including how
autofill affects security. Have a look and share your comments with us on
the blog:

Cheers,
