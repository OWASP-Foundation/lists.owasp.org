Happy Holidays Everyone!

The speaker for our last meeting for the year is Michael Sutton and he will
be talking about the next generation offline application which I guarantee
to you will be part of your favorite bug parade (e.g. OWASP Top 10, CWE Top
25...) in the next 2 years. Michael Sutton, Vice President and security
research at Zscaler, is perhaps best known for co-authoring "Fuzzing: Brute
Force Vulnerability Discovery", an Addison-Wesley publication

Please RSVP back to me in case you intend to come. We also intend to go out
for food/drinks after the talk.
