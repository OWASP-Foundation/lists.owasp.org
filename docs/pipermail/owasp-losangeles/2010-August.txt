Topic 1:  Secure Coding Practices and Procedures
Speaker 1:  Miguel (Mike) O. Villegas, Director of Information
Security, Newegg, Inc

Abstract 1
Organizations process information over web applications that can be
often classified as sensitive, confidential, or considered
intellectual property. Web Application Firewalls (WAF) provide
protection for business critical data and web applications with an
automated and transparent approach to monitor and protect enterprise
data as it is accessed and transacted through applications. To augment
WAF filtering and vulnerability monitoring, many organizations have
developed or outsource secure code reviews and development.
Information Security at Newegg established their own .NET C# secure
coding standard, train and test our developers on secure coding, and
do their own secure code reviews with WebInspect and manual code
reviews.  They started to develop a web application threat modeling
approach but it is still in its infancy.  This presentation focuses on
the secure coding standard, satisfying PCI requirements for such, and
training / testing of developers in secure coding practices using
OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities as its foundation.

Topic 2: Title: Threat Modeling at Symantec
Speaker 2: Edward Bonver, Principal Software Engineer, Symantec
Research Labs, Office of the CTO, Symantec Corporation

Abstract 2
Threat Modeling is one of the most important security activities that
a development/QA team needs to perform as part of a Security
Development Lifecycle. This activity allows the team to build a
complete security profile of the system being built. Threat Modeling
is not always easy to get going for a team that has little or no
security experience. In this presentation we'll take a look at why
Threat Modeling is so important; we'll explore the process behind it,
and how the process is being implemented and followed across Symantec.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinKWrxR9XQYuR=yjLHSYrzCc9zuJGvDAY6s1DyD@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP friends,

Our friends at ISACA Los Angeles chapter shares the following with you.

Please see their website, http://www.isacala.org/, for registration information.

Thank you.


=====================
The Information Systems Audit and Control Association's (ISACA) Los
Angeles Chapter's and HTCIA?s next Meeting will be held on Tuesday,
September 14, 2010, at Monterey Hill Restaurant.

PRE-DINNER MEETING TOPIC:
Leveraging COBIT: Beyond IT - Malcolm McKee, Founder and Chief
Executive Officer, Trango Advisory
                                                   - Wayne Hackelton,
President and Chief Operating Officer, Trango Advisory

3:30pm to 5:00pm - ABOUT THE PRE-MEETING TOPIC

Join us for an interactive discussion on the critical role COBIT plays
outside of the IT department with experts Malcolm McKee and Wayne
Hackelton from Trango Advisory. In an era where the value of every
department is questioned, now more than ever IT departments must
identify their priorities, focus their activities, and communicate
their performance. Discussions will center on how IT directors can
leverage their compliance with the COBIT framework outside of the IT
department.

DINNER MEETING TOPIC:
Cloud Computing and Security ? Dr. Eugene Schulz, CISM, CISSP, GSLC,
CTO ? Emagined Security

5:30pm to 8:30pm - ABOUT THE TOPIC

Cloud computing services provide dynamically scalable and often
virtualized resources as a service over the Internet on an as-needed
basis. Users do not have to know how the services and resources work,
nor do cloud customer organizations have to set up and control
technology infrastructures needed to support cloud services. Although
cloud computing offers substantial cost savings, improved computing
and network performance, and other advantages, cloud computing also
introduces a plethora of security-related risks, many of which are
serious and also presently not well-understood.

Among these risks, data security breaches stand out as one of the
potentially most serious types. What can organizations that use cloud
computing services for data storage do to control data loss-related
risk, how effective are commonly deployed controls, and what is the
cost versus benefit ratio for each control? Additionally, cloud
computing introduces a variety of legal risks of which cloud computing
customers are sometimes unaware. These risks and potential mitigation
measures will also be discussed.

====================
