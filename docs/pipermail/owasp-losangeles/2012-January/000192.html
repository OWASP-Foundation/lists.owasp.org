<PRE>Dear OWASP Friends,

As we are starting our new year, the board and volunteers at OWASP LA
chapter are working hard to bring a series of exciting events for you.

First, some announcements.

1. Edward Bonver, Senior Principal Engineer at Symantec, joins OWASP
LA Board of Directors
2. We are moving to Meetup as our registration platform
(<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/</A>)
3. ISSA LA has lunch meeting with Securing the SDLC talk on January 18
(<A HREF="http://www.issa-la.org/">http://www.issa-la.org/</A>)
4. Our meeting is on January 25th with Robert Zigweid of IOActive
presenting Security in the Cloud


Now, the details.

** Edward Bonver

We are lucky to have someone of Edward's caliber to join OWASP Los
Angeles Board of Directors. Edward is a Senior Principal Engineer at
Symantec's Product Security group. Edward is actively working on
improving Symantec's secure coding and security testing-related
methodologies, policies and processes. Edward is also a Ph.D.
(Computer Science) candidate at NOVA Southeastern University.

No stranger to OWASP, Edward has presented at various OWASP meetings
and conferences, and attended 2011 OWASP Summit in Portugal. Please
say hi to him and wish him the best.

** Meetup

We have moved from Eventbrite to Meetup as our registration platform.
Our Wiki (<A HREF="http://www.owaspLA.org">http://www.owaspLA.org</A>) will continue to be the primary
website for announcements and archives, but registration will be done
on the Meetup site.

Our Meetup address is <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/.">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/.</A>

** Securing the SDLC at ISSA Los Angeles

This is a topic of great interest to OWASP community and ISSA has
special price for OWASP members. Speaker Jerry Hoff is the VP of the
Static Code Analysis division at WhiteHat security and lead
contributor to OWASP AppSec tutorial series (on YouTube).

Please RSVP here:
<A HREF="http://www.issa-la.org/2011/12/24/january-2012-issa-la-monthly-member-meeting/">http://www.issa-la.org/2011/12/24/january-2012-issa-la-monthly-member-meeting/</A>

Topic: Securing the SDLC

There are multiple documents, methodologies and schools of thought for
adding security activities to each step of the SDLC.  In this
presentation we will go through several of the more popular
methodologies and discuss advantages / disadvantages of each.  We will
also discuss challenges and resistance of trying to add security to an
entrenched development process.

** January OWASP meeting

It's on January 25th at Symantec offices, starting at 7:00PM. As
usual, refreshments will be served, thank to our sponsor Lenovo.

Please RSVP at <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/events/47403862/.">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/events/47403862/.</A>

Topic: Security in the Cloud

It is no surprise that the emergence of cloud computing and
virtualization are creating a noticeable buzz across the IT space.
Still, the cloud by itself is a mystery to many customers. &#160;When
information security is introduced to the mix, the picture becomes
Cloudy. &#160;Add compliance requirements such as PCI, and it's downright
Stormy! &#160;In this presentation, Mr. Zigweid will discuss ways to
achieve data security in a cloud environment. &#160;This includes what a
cloud customer should watch out for and what they should expect from
their provider in order to meet compliance requirements.

Speaker

Robert Zigweid is an accomplished developer and application tester
with advanced skills in the creation and analysis of systems
architecture and threat modeling. As a Senior Security Consultant at
IOActive, he works with clients to discover and solve network and
application problems that threaten their business goals and assets. In
addition to his direct efforts on penetration tests, security reviews,
and network and application audits, Zigweid contributes to the
advancement of more stable, secure systems through his research and
development. He was a co-founder of OSJava, is working on a JDBC
driver and more robust Java class loader, and has conducted
groundbreaking research that will further the formal understanding of
application and network security for audiences at varying levels of
technical fluency.

I hope to see you at ISSA and OWASP meetings.

Safe and prosperous 2012!

Tin
