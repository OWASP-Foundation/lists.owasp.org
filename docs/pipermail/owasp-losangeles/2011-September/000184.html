Topic: Deep XSS Defense

This talk will discuss the past methods used for XSS defense that were
only partially effective. Learning from these lessons, will will also
discuss present day defensive methodologies that are effective, but
place an undue burden on the developer. We will then finish with a
discussion of future XSS defense mythologies that shift the burden of
XSS defense from the developer to various frameworks. These include
auto-escaping template technologies, browser-based defenses such as
Content Security Policy, and Javascript sandboxes such as the Google
CAJA project and JSReg.
