<PRE>Dear OWASP members,

Summer is coming to an end but things are still sizzling at OWASP LA chapter.

This year AppSec USA will be held in Minneapolis from September 20 to
23. Justin Collins and I will be presenting Brakeman static analysis
tool for Ruby on Rails security defects. If you are planning to be
there, please let me know. And it's still not too late to sign up for
the conference.

<A HREF="http://www.appsecUSA.org">http://www.appsecUSA.org</A>

LA chapter is cooperating with (ISC)2 to host SecureSDLC SoCal one-day
conference in Anaheim on November 1. SecureSDLC arms software
professionals with the latest tools and information regarding
application security. It will address building security in from the
ground up, tackle what to consider when securing each phase of the
software lifecycle, and investigate how companies can create their own
software assurance program.

Our own Cassio Goldschmidt and a few other key members will be making
presentations there. Please join us if you can. The event is free for
(ISC)2 members, and $75 discounted price for OWASP members with code
OWASP. In addition, we are giving away one free pass each at our
September and October meetings.

You can read more about SecureSDLC at:
<A HREF="https://www.isc2.org/EventDetails.aspx?id=7703">https://www.isc2.org/EventDetails.aspx?id=7703</A>

Related to (ISC)2, Cassio has been nominated for Information Security
Practitioner Leadership award by (ISC)2. The winner will be announced
on September 21. Please read more about it here:
<A HREF="https://www.isc2.org/PressReleaseDetails.aspx?id=7829">https://www.isc2.org/PressReleaseDetails.aspx?id=7829</A>

Last, but not least, the grand price -- FREE HACKER TRAINING FOR ONE YEAR!

One of OWASP LA full members (i.e., paid members) will be selected
during September 28 meeting to receive a free membership to The Hacker
Academy (<A HREF="http://www.thehackeracademy.com/">http://www.thehackeracademy.com/</A>). This will provide you the
opportunity to get ongoing training on-line, including hands-on labs,
for a full year. The value for this great giveaway is $1,000.

You do not need to be present to win, but you must be a paid member to
enter the drawing. If you are not a paid member, you are welcome to
join (before September 26) at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A> (under Individual
Supporters). Annual due is $50 per year. I hope you will join.

Enjoy the rest of the summer, and be safe!

Tin
