The Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID) 2007 Report


The web hacking incident database (WHID) is a Web Application Security
Consortium project dedicated to maintaining a list of web applications
related security incidents. The database classifies each reported attack by,
among other criteria, the method used, the outcome of the attack and the
industry and the country of the attacked organization. Based on the database
Breach Labs which sponsors WHID issues a periodical report on trends in Web
Application Security.


By providing answers to questions such as:

   - The drivers behind Web hacking.
   - The technology hackers use.
   - The types of organizations attacked most often.
   - The common outcomes


The presentation will discuss WHID statistics, focusing on rising trends in
Web Attacks in the 1st half of 2008. As the WHID enables research into the
business model behind hacking, the presentation goes beyond discussing the
technical aspects of attacks such as SQL injection crawlers and Web Site
herding, to discussing the business model common to all of the attacks:
Economy of scale.
