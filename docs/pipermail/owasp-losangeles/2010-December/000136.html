*Topic: Deep Dive into Web Application Scanning*
*Speakers:*

*Brian Robison*, is the Senior Product Manager for McAfee's enterprise
vulnerability management solutions. Driven by a relentless desire for
customer satisfaction and leveraging over a decade of experience in security
and risk management, he is primarily responsible for the strategy and
roadmap of McAfee's enterprise vulnerability management offerings, including
the web application assessment module. Brian joined McAfee in 2005 as a
Technical Marketing Engineer focusing on McAfee's endpoint security products
before serving as the Product Manager for McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 4.0.

*Sven Schrecker* joined McAfee in 2006 as part of the Preventsys
acquisition. He has worked extensively on the integration of Risk &amp;
Compliance products into McAfee's ePolicy Orchestrator product. Most
recently, he directed the efforts on the total revamp of the Web Assessment
Engine for McAfee Vulnerability Manager (formerly known as Foundstone). He
is currently architecting cloud-based security technologies.
 *
**Abstract:*

Web applications have exploded to become the point of entry for hackers
wanting to do harm. Knowing how and where web applications are vulnerable is
key to sustaining goodwill and ensuring a positive experience for those who
rely on those applications. Learn tips and techniques for effectively
scanning web applications to keep them safe and secure. Hear about best
practices from other McAfee customers for web application scanning.
